    "protostellar collapse is one of the most important processes in star formation ; it exhibits a high dynamic range in density and spatial dimensions .",
    "adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) is a powerful technique for performing numerical simulations requiring a high dynamic range in the mesh schemes .",
    "local high - resolution is realized by employing grids of differing resolutions .",
    "the finer grids are inserted and their location changed according to given refinement criteria . following the introduction of the fundamental principles of amr by @xcite and @xcite , this technique is becoming widely used in astrophysical simulations .    in star formation , along with self - gravity , the magnetic field also plays an important role .",
    "both self - gravity and magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) are therefore implemented in recent amr codes ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "existing self - gravitational mhd amr codes are generally based on cartesian grids ; although block - structured grids tend to be most often frequently , alternative approaches also exist , e.g. ramses @xcite . in block - structured amr ,",
    "numerical cells are refined in the unit of the block , and a block is itself an ordinal uniform grid .",
    "block - structured grids are divided into two categories : patch - oriented grids and self - similar blocks . in the former approach ,",
    "a block has variable number of cells , and the shape of the block is also changed in the course of refinement .",
    "a large block containing many cells and a small block containing just a few cells can co - exist .",
    "this approach originated in the study of @xcite , and has been adopted in many codes : e.g. , the amr code of berkeley @xcite , enzo @xcite , and riemann @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "all blocks contain the same number of cells , but the physical sizes of the blocks are different .",
    "this approach has also been adopted by many codes : e.g. , flash @xcite , and nirvana @xcite .",
    "this approach offers advantages including relatively simple algorithms for refinement , parallelization , and vectorization .",
    "this paper also follows this latter approach .",
    "in particular , this approach enables the amr code to implement a full multigrid ( fmg)-cycle in the multigrid method for self - gravity .",
    "this scheme is an extension of the multigrid method for the nested grid approach @xcite to the amr grid .",
    "there are several ways to treat the mhd , particularly in the treatment of the @xmath0 term .",
    "these approaches may be categorized as ( 1 ) the constrained transport method with a staggered grid , ( 2 ) the projection scheme with a poisson solver , and ( 3 ) the eight - wave formulation ( see @xcite for a comparison of these schemes ) .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an alternative scheme for cleaning the @xmath0 term .",
    "this scheme has a formulation that is similar to , but distinct from , the eight - wave formulation ; two additional waves transfer the @xmath0 error isotropically at a given speed , and the waves decay at a given rate . as a result",
    ", the error is propagated independently of the gas motion , and so is diluted .",
    "by contrast , using the eight - wave formulation , a single additional wave transfers the error at the gas velocity .",
    "the error is always propagated downstream of the gas motion , and can become stagnated at the shock wave and the center of the collapsing cloud .",
    "the scheme of @xcite is therefore adopted here .",
    "the author has previously developed a self - gravitational mhd code with a nested grid @xcite . in the nested grid approach",
    ", the grids are refined adaptively , while the sizes and positions of the sub - grids are fixed . the problems to",
