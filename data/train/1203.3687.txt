    "collective spin and isospin excitations in atomic nuclei have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies ( for an extensive review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of particular interest is the gamow - teller ( gt ) resonance , a collective oscillation of neutrons that coherently change the direction of their spins and isospins without changing their orbital motion .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the gt strength distribution is essential for the understanding of nuclear beta - decay and weak processes in stars  @xcite .",
    "it was first predicted in 1963  @xcite and observed in @xmath0 reactions a decade later  @xcite .",
    "further measurements identified a problem that is still actively discussed , and that is the quenching of the gamow - teller strength . in numerous experiments across the whole nuclear chart only around 60% of the strength predicted by the model - independent ikeda sum rule had been observed  @xcite .",
    "these experiments , however , were only able to measure the strength up to the excitation energy of the giant resonance .",
    "a consistent analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 reaction data from @xmath2zr over a much wider range of excitation energies , concluded that the gt strength is actually quenched by approximately 10%  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models systematically overestimate the transition strength compared to the measured values  @xcite .",
    "this effect was attributed to two possible processes : ( i ) coupling of the gt mode to @xmath8-isobar nucleon - hole ( @xmath9 ) configurations , and ( ii ) second - order configuration mixing .",
    "it has been shown that the former process is responsible for only a small fraction of the quenching  @xcite , leaving the latter as the major mechanism for shifting the gt strength to higher energies  @xcite .",
    "the spin - isospin operator structure of the @xmath0 probe is similar to that of the gamow - teller ( gt ) operator  @xcite .",
    "however , they become comparable only if the gt cross section is measured at very small momentum transfer @xmath10 . in the @xmath0 reaction",
    "this condition can be met only for zero degree scattering , small excitation energies , and high bombarding energies .",
    "extraction of the @xmath5 strength at high excitation energies , where higher - multipole response dominates , is very difficult  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent experiments reported data on the gamow - teller response in @xmath2zr , in both @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7 channels  @xcite , up to 50 mev excitation energies . therefore , in the total strength , contributions from higher - order terms in the expansion in @xmath10 appear , the first of which is the isovector spin monopole ( ivsm ) mode . this mode , with the transition operator @xmath11 , represents a collective excitation of the nucleus with quantum numbers @xmath12 , @xmath5 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "even though the first observation of the isovector spin monopole mode was reported in 1983  @xcite , a quantitative analysis and determination of the strength remain difficult  @xcite .",
    "the unknown ivsm strength also introduces uncertainties in the measurement of the gamow - teller strength . to obtain precise quantitative data on the total gt strength , and indirectly on the quenching , the contribution of the isovector spin monopole mode and of higher - order terms in momentum transfer ,",
    "must be subtracted from the measured strength .",
    "although interference occurs between the gt and ivsm modes , these contributions are usually subtracted incoherently from the spectrum because the distribution of gt strength in the ivsm resonance region is unknown  @xcite . related to new measurements of nuclear response in unstable nuclei  @xcite ,",
    "the correct treatment of effects that influence the extraction of the gamow - teller strength is all the more important .",
    "not much theoretical work has been reported on the ivsm strength so far .",
    "isovector spin excitations with angular momentum @xmath15 , and @xmath16 have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite employing the skyrme siii hartree - fock model and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) with a schematic residual p - h interaction .",
    "the skyrme functionals sgii and siii were used in a self - consistent hf + tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) study that focused only on the ivsm mode in @xmath17ca , @xmath2zr and @xmath18pb  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the ivsm mode was identified at excitation energies between 20 mev and 60 mev with respect to the ground state energy of the parent nucleus .",
    "a non - energy - weighted sum rule was devised that involves particle numbers and radii , and the calculated strengths were shown to be consistent with values obtained from ground - state densities .",
    "the effect of the isovector spin monopole mode and higher - order terms in momentum transfer on the quenching of gt strength has not been investigated so far .    in this study",
    "we explore the ivsm mode of excitation within a self - consistent microscopic theory , and analyze the effect of momentum transfer on spin - isospin excitations . the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) + proton - neutron relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - rqrpa ) framework is employed for the calculation of the ivsm strength .",
    "this framework , based on the covariant energy density functional theory , is a charge - exchange extension of the relativistic quasiparticle rpa formulated in the canonical basis of the rhb model  @xcite .",
    "the rhb + pn - rqrpa have already been successfully applied to the analysis of the fermi and the gamow - teller response  @xcite , @xmath19-decay half - lives  @xcite , neutrino - nucleus cross - sections  @xcite , total muon capture rates  @xcite , and electron capture rates  @xcite .",

    "the same interactions are used in the rhb equations that determine the canonical quasiparticle basis , and in the matrix equations of the rqrpa .",
