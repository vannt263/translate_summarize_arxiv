    "it is the purpose of the present paper to elaborate such connections .",
    "the phenomenological building block in our work consists of a kinetic rate equation which accounts for charmonium dissociation and regeneration in a thermally expanding fireball .",
    "the in - medium charmonium properties figuring into the rate equation are inferred from spectral functions which are constrained by euclidean correlators and hq free energies computed in thermal lqcd .",

    "we explicitly verify that the  reconstructed \" spectral functions yield euclidean correlator ratios which vary little with temperature ( say , within @xmath310% ) , as found in lqcd . in view of the ongoing debate as to whether the free or internal energy is a more suitable quantity to be identified with a hq potential",
    ", we will explore both possibilities as supplied through the @xmath2-matrix calculations in ref .",
    "as found there and in previous works  @xcite , the free and internal energy may be considered as providing an lower and upper limit , respectively , on the dissociation temperatures of charmonia , which in the following we will refer to as weak- and strong - binding scenarios .",
    "we will elaborate the phenomenological consequences of both scenarios for charmonium observables in urhics at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , including centrality , transverse - momentum ( @xmath4 ) and rapidity ( @xmath5 ) dependencies .",

    "[ sec_equil ] we examine the equilibrium properties of charmonia obtained from lqcd via the potential model and extract the key parameters needed for the kinetic approach of charmonium production in urhics . in sec .",

    "the latter defines the temperature above which regeneration is not operative ( _ i.e. _ , the gain term of the rate equation is set to zero ) .",

    "[ ssec_sf ] we combine the extracted quantities to  re - construct \" charmonium spectral functions and evaluate corresponding euclidean correlator ratios in light of lqcd results .",
    "lattice qcd currently provides equilibrium properties of charmonium mainly in terms of two quantities : + 1 . the free energy , @xmath14 , of a static pair of heavy quark and anti - quark .",
    "this is the main input for recent potential models .",
    "it remains controversial to date whether the free energy , the internal energy , @xmath15 or any combination thereof , should be identified with a static @xmath16 potential at finite temperature , @xmath2 . in this work we therefore study two scenarios where either @xmath17 or @xmath18 is used as potential , @xmath19 .",

    "the imaginary part of the fourier transform of the correlation function , @xmath24 , is commonly referred to as the spectral function , @xmath25 which is related to the temporal correlator via @xmath26 with the finite-@xmath2 kernel @xmath27}{\\sinh[\\omega/2 t ] } \\ . \\label{kernel}\\ ] ] lattice qcd results for two - point correlation functions are usually normalized to a  reconstructed \" correlator evaluated with the kernel at temperature @xmath2 , @xmath28 but with a spectral function at low temperature , @xmath29 , where no significant medium effects are expected .",
    "the correlator ratio , @xmath30 is then an indicator of medium effects in @xmath31 through deviations from one .",
    "current lqcd calculations find that the correlator ratio , @xmath32 , in the pseudoscalar ( @xmath33 ) and vector ( @xmath0 ) channel are close to 1 ( within ca .",
    "10% ) at temperatures up to 2 - 3@xmath1  @xcite . in the @xmath34-wave channels ( scalar and axialvector ) the correlators ratios",
    "are substantially enhanced over 1 at large @xmath23 .",
    "this feature is believed to be due to  zero - mode \" contributions ( at @xmath35=0 ) which are related to the scattering of a charm ( or anti - charm ) quark , @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) , rather than to @xmath38 bound - state properties  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is supported by studies of the @xmath23-derivative of @xmath34-wave correlator ratios , which exhibits a much smaller variation ( in the limit that the zero - mode part is a @xmath39-function , @xmath40 , its contribution to the temporal correlator is a constant )  @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "the in - medium properties of charmonia , such as pole mass , in - medium width and dissociation temperature , are fully encoded in their spectral function .",
    "however , the finite number of data points for the two - point correlator computed in lqcd severely hampers the inversion of the transform in eq .",
    "( [ gtau - sig ] ) , rendering the determination of the spectral function difficult .",
    "in fact , potential - model analyses have shown that the use of either the free _ or _ internal energy can lead to agreement with lqcd correlators , albeit with rather different underlying binding properties ( and associated dissociation temperatures ) . in the present work",
    "we therefore adopt the following strategy : we first extract the charm - quark masses and charmonium pole mass from a potential model , allowing us to define the binding energy according to eq .",
    "( [ epsb ] ) .",
    "the latter is an important ingredient in the quantitative evaluation of the @xmath6 dissociation rate  @xcite , which will be done in the following section ( [ ssec_diss ] ) in a perturbative (  quasifree \" ) approximation .",
    "we then  reconstruct \" in - medium charmonium spectral functions using a relativistic breit - wigner + continuum ansatz , where the @xmath6 width and mass figure into the breit - wigner part while the continuum is determined by the open - charm threshold ( 2@xmath41 ) .",
    "for a more realistic evaluation , we include polestrength factor , @xmath42 , for the breit - wigner strength and a nonperturbative rescattering enhancement in the continuum  @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the polestrength factor furthermore serves to estimate the dissociation temperature of the ground state in each channel .    for definiteness",
    "we employ the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite where quarkonium spectral functions and correlators have been calculated in a thermodynamic @xmath2-matrix approach , consistent with vacuum spectroscopy and including relativistic corrections for a proper description of scattering states .",
    "the calculations in there have been carried out for both free and internal energies as potential , and for two different lqcd inputs  @xcite . in both cases ( and for both potentials ) , an approximate constancy ( within @xmath315% ) of the correlator ratios for pseudoscalar charmonium has been found ( see lower panels of fig .  12 and 14 in ref .",
    "we believe that these results provide a reasonable representation and bracket for potential - model results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_mc ] the temperature - dependent charm - quark mass is displayed , which is identified with the asymptotic value of the hq potential , @xmath43 the in - medium masses decrease with temperature appreciably , while the magnitude of @xmath44 is significantly smaller in the weak - binding compared to the strong - binding scenario . as expected , the binding energies ( plotted in fig .  [ fig_epsb ] ) also decrease with @xmath2 , again being significantly smaller in the weak - binding scenario .",
    "these features are , in fact , the main reason that both scenarios can be compatible with the small variations found in the lqcd correlator ratios : for weak / strong binding , a small / large constituent mass combines with a small / large binding energy , respectively , leading to an approximate compensation in the bound - state mass , @xmath45 , recall eq.([epsb ] ) .",
    "the inelastic dissociation rate of charmonia in the medium , @xmath46 , plays a central role in urhic phenomenology as it directly governs the time dependence of their abundance in an underlying rate equation ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , eq .  ( [ rate - eq ] ) below ) .",
    "it contributes to the total width of the corresponding charmonium spectral function ( in addition to elastic scattering which we neglect in the present work ) .",
    "however , it is currently not possible to quantitatively extract the width from temporal correlators  @xcite : for phenomenologically relevant values of the width of a few tens of mev ( or even up to 200mev ) the correlator ratios are affected at a level of @xmath475%  @xcite which is too small to be discerned from other uncertainties at this point . furthermore , elastic and inelastic collisions contribute to the width with an a priori unknown partition ( for relatively loosely bound states one expects the dissociation width to be dominant ) . in the present work",
    "we therefore calculate the dissociation rate based on perturbative qcd with an effective strong coupling constant which we later fine tune to reproduce the observed @xmath0 suppression in central a - a collisions .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath48 turns out to be @xmath470.3 , quite compatible with the short - distance ( color - coulomb ) term in the effective potential used to extract the binding energies discussed in the previous section .",

    "the charmonium dissociation cross section becomes twice the elastic cross section between the parton and the @xmath56 quark , @xmath59 , as , _",
    "e.g. _ , given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to account for the leading kinematic correction from the residual binding energy , the incoming parton needs to be energetic enough to break up the bound state , which sets a lower limit for the incoming parton momentum .",

    "the 3-momentum dependence of the rates shows a monotonous increase with increasing @xmath70 , which becomes more pronounced with increasing binding energy ( for larger @xmath78 a finite 3-momentum facilitates the break - up since , on average , a larger center - of - mass energy is available in the collision of the bound state with thermal partons ) . this increase is a simple kinematic consequence of a monotonously increasing ( or even constant ) cross section with finite threshold and an increasing parton flux encountered by the moving @xmath0 .    in the following section we determine the interplay of the charmonium widths with their binding energies extracted in the previous section in order to assess their survival in the qgp ( _ e.g. _ , as a resonance ) .",

    "more surprisingly , the high-@xmath115 suppression is very similar in both strong- and weak - binding scenarios , despite the fact that the high-@xmath115 yield is exclusively due to the primordial component whose strength is very different in the 2 scenarios at low @xmath115 .",
    "the reason is the 3-momentum dependence of the dissociation rates , which become quite similar in the 2 scenarios at large 3-momentum : at @xmath264  gev , the difference in the energy - threshold due to binding energies of several 100mev becomes less relevant so that a collision with almost any thermal parton is energetic enough for dissociating the bound state .",
    "let us finally comment on the elliptic flow , @xmath265 , of the @xmath0 , which was hoped to be another good discriminator of primordial and regenerated production .",
    "for the former , a nonzero @xmath266 is basically due to the path - length difference when traversing the azimuthally asymmetric fireball , typically not exceeding 2 - 3% . for the latter",
    ", much larger values can be obtained if the coalescing charm quarks are close to thermalized . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the well - known mass effect suppresses the @xmath265 for heavy particles at @xmath267 ; it is precisely in this momentum regime where the regeneration component is prominent .",
    "thus , we predict that in both strong- and weak - binding scenarios the total @xmath0 @xmath265 does not exceed @xmath473% at any @xmath115 .",
    "the only alternative option we can envision are strong elastic interactions of the @xmath0 which is only conceivable in the strong binding scenario to avoid break - up in scattering off thermal partons  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work was to construct charmonium spectral functions which are constrained by thermal lattice - qcd computations , and to apply them to experimental data in heavy - ion collisions . employing a thermal rate equation we have implemented equilibrium properties of charmonia ( binding energy , constituent charm - quark mass and dissociation rate ) as extracted from a thermodynamic @xmath2-matrix calculation .",
    "the resulting spectral functions for two  limiting \" scenarios , with small and large @xmath0 dissociation temperatures , have been verified to produce a weak temperature dependence in pertinent euclidean correlators , roughly compatible with lqcd .",
    "we have argued that these two scenarios may serve as generic representatives for charmonium kinetics in heavy - ion collisions , bracketing strong and weak in - medium binding .",
    "therefore , we believe that the qualitative conclusions drawn from these two scenarios should be rather model - independent . within current theoretical uncertainties ( especially for the degree of charm - quark relaxation and its impact on the @xmath0 regeneration yield ) and essentially two fit parameters ( @xmath268 and",
    "@xmath48 controlling the regeneration yield and suppression strength ) both scenarios can reproduce sps and rhic data for the centrality dependence of inclusive @xmath0 production reasonably well . however , the partition of primordial and regenerated yields is quite different in the two scenarios : the former dominates for strong binding ( down to 50% in central au - au at rhic ) , while for weak binding regeneration largely prevails at rhic energies ( except for peripheral collisions ) .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath115 dependence of the @xmath0 yield in both scenarios and found that differences in the average @xmath122 reach up to 20% in semicentral au - au collisions .",
    "the strong - binding scenario seems slightly favored in this observable , but theoretical uncertainties ( e.g. , the blast - wave treatment of the regeneration component ) prevent us from definite conclusions at this point .",
    "we also have to await more accurate @xmath85-@xmath85 and @xmath70(d)-@xmath85 data , where the latter determine the input in terms of shadowing , nuclear absorption and cronin effects .",
    "further developments of the theoretical approach are in order , and we plan to improve our calculations in several respects . first , as mentioned before , work is in progress employing a boltzmann transport equation ( [ boltz ] ) extended by a microscopic treatment of the gain term to treat charmonia regeneration and dissociation on the same footing .",
    "this will enable an explicit account of ( time - dependent ) charm - quark phase - space distribution in @xmath56-@xmath57 recombination reactions , as following , _",
    "e.g. _ , from realistic langevin simulations  @xcite with constraints from the @xmath2-matrix formalism and from open - charm observables .",
    "second , hydrodynamic simulation of the medium evolution could be employed for a more detailed and realistic description of the temperature and the flow field of the underlying medium , especially in coordinate space .",
    "third , a microscopic model for primordial @xmath38 and charmonium production is warranted to better disentangle nuclear shadowing and absorption in the pre - equilibrium stage , including formation - time effects .",
    "this would improve the initial conditions to the kinetic approach in the hot medium .",
    "these developments will eventually produce a comprehensive approach which can serve as a quantitative bridge between theoretical studies of charmonia in the qgp ( and hg ) and their phenomenology in heavy - ion collisions . as our investigations in the present paper have shown , quantitative studies at the 10 - 20% level are needed to deduce basic properties of the strong force ( such as color screening of coulomb and confining interactions ) from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these insights are also pivotal to improve our knowledge of the phase structure of hot and dense qcd matter .",
