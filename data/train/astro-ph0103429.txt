    "the observed eccentricity distribution is approximately thermal ( @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the number of orbits in the interval @xmath2 to @xmath7 ) for binaries with periods @xmath8  days , but for systems with @xmath9  days , @xmath2 and @xmath0 are correlated such that smaller @xmath0 imply , on average , smaller @xmath2 . for",

    "pre - main sequence binaries show the same wide range of parameters and correlations ( mathieu 1994 ) .",
    "the available cloud - collapse calculations have not been able to produce the wide range of observed periods , and in particular do not lead to short - period ( @xmath9  d ) systems ( bodenheimer et al . 2000 for a review ) .",
    "however , even the most recent numerical refinements can not describe stellar formation to the point where gas - dynamical processes can be neglected , so that the final theoretical orbital parameters of binary systems can not be quantified .",
    "we do not know for sure yet if there exists some significant magneto - hydrodynamical mechanism that is important in transforming a theoretical period distribution that results from fragmentation to the final wide @xmath10 observed already among  1  myr old populations .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible that no such mechanism is needed , and that the final ( observed ) orbital parameters of galactic - field systems are a result of gravitational encounters in very dense embedded clusters that disperse rapidly .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that stellar - dynamical interactions in typical embedded clusters spanning a wide range of densities can not significantly widen a period distribution .",
    "too few orbits are redistributed to @xmath12  days by encounters assuming the primordial period distribution is confined to the range @xmath13  days .",
    "similarly , typical embedded clusters can not evolve an arbitrary eccentricity distribution to the thermal form ( kroupa 1995b ) .",

    "a direct @xmath3-body code must deal efficiently with a range of dynamical time - scales spanning many orders of magnitude , from days to hundreds of  myrs .",
    "the code of choice is aarseth s nbody6 ( aarseth 1999 ) .",
    "special mathematical techniques are employed to transform the space - time coordinates of closely interacting stars , which may be perturbed by neighbours , such that the resulting equations of motion of the sub - system are regular ( mikkola & aarseth 1993 ) .",

    "the velocity and position vectors of any individual centre - of - mass particle ( e.g. a star or binary system ) diverges exponentially from the true trajectory , through the growth of errors in @xmath3body computations ( e.g. goodman , heggie & hut 1993 ) .",
    "however , statistical results from @xmath3body calculations correctly describe the overall dynamical evolution , as shown , for example , by giersz & heggie ( 1994 ) who compare ensembles of @xmath3-body computations with statistical stellar - dynamical methods .",
    "thus , for each model constructed here an ensemble is created in order to obtain reliable estimates of the relevant statistical quantities .",
    "the output from nbody6 is analysed by a software package that finds all bound binary systems , and allows the construction of distribution functions of orbital parameters , among many other things .",
    "initial stellar masses are distributed according to a three - part power - law imf ( kroupa 2001b ) , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the number of stars in the mass range @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",

    "the period distribution of late - type systems is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of binaries with orbits in the interval log@xmath32 and log@xmath33 in which the primary has a mass @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the number of single stars and binaries with primaries , respectively , in this mass interval .",

    "fig : fp ] below ) .",
    "all binary systems initially have orbits with eccentricity @xmath38 , but the results are not sensitive to this value ( kroupa 1995b ) .    these assumptions allow us to test the hypothesis that binary  binary and binary  single - star encounters in very compact young clusters widen the period distribution to the form observed in the galactic field , and re - distribute the eccentricities to give the thermal distribution observed for galactic - field systems .",
    "clusters initially in virial equilibrium ( ve ) and in cold collapse ( cc ) with @xmath39 and  1000 stars are set up to cover a range of extreme initial conditions ( table  [ tab : mods ] ) .",
    "the ve models are spherical plummer number - density profiles ( aarseth , hnon & wielen 1974 ) initially , with position and velocity vectors not correlated with the system masses . the initial half - mass radius , @xmath40 , is chosen to give a three - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath41 , that equals the orbital velocity of a binary with a system mass of @xmath42 and a period , @xmath43  days , near the maximum in the g - dwarf period distribution of duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) . the central densities of these models are extreme and probably unrealistic , in that many of the binary systems overlap .",
    "however , these models allow us to study the very extreme situation in which binary  binary interactions dominate initial cluster evolution , and will thus pose limits on the possible widening of the period distribution as a result of these interactions .",

    "the core radius of the ve models increases immediately as a consequence of binary - star heating for the highly concentrated n2v and n2v1 models , whereas it decreases in the less concentrated n3v model during the first few @xmath60 as a result of mass segregation .",

    "[ fig : ft ] .    as noted above , the binaries initially overlap in the ve models , causing immediate disruption of the widest systems leading to a population of single stars in the cluster .",

    "binary disruption starts as soon as the cluster has contracted sufficiently for the widest pairs to interact .",
    "disruption continues throughout and beyond cold collapse , with binaries with an increasing binding energy playing an increasing role . during this time",
    ", an increasing amount of kinetic energy is used up to disrupt these binaries .",
    "how the cold collapse is affected by such a large primordial binary population is an interesting topic , but will not be addressed further here . in both cc models , the final @xmath68 is slightly higher than the binary proportion in the galactic field .    during the binary  binary interactions some systems are perturbed or exchange companions , rather than being disrupted .",
    "this leads to changes in their orbital parameters .",
    "the final distributions of orbits in the eccentricity  period diagram are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep ]",
    ".    a significant broadening of the eccentricity distribution is evident , but the final distributions retain a maximum near @xmath38 which is not consistent with the observational distribution ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "thus , the stellar - dynamical encounters in extremely concentrated clusters can not evolve a delta - eccentricity distribution to the observed thermal distribution .",
    "similarly , a significant but not sufficient broadening of the period distribution , @xmath10 , occurs in models n2v",
    "/ v1 , but the effect on @xmath10 is small in the other models .",
    "[ fig : fp ] demonstrates that the initial distribution can not evolve through stellar - dynamical interactions to the observed broad log - normal distribution .",
    "this is the case even under the extreme assumption that the evolution of the n2v1 cluster is halted pre - maturely , for example through the expulsion of the remnant natal gas , and that the single - star population that emerges from the disruption of the binaries is lost preferentially through ejection and mass segregation before gas - expulsion . in this",

    "[ fig : fp ] , @xmath75 is plotted for model n2v1 , but even this artificially enhanced period distribution disagrees with the observed distribution .",
    "the finding is thus that stellar - dynamical interactions in compact star clusters can not change an initially delta - eccentricity distribution and narrow period distribution to the thermal eccentricity and wide log - period distribution observed in the galactic field .",
    "it follows that the main characteristics of these distributions ( thermal @xmath76 and orbits ranging from days to myrs ) must be a result of fragmentation during star - formation and subsequent magneto - hydrodynamical processes ."
