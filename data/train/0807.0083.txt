    "+ finally , our results can explain the origin of the region with the highest density of star formation activity ever observed in a local cluster ( a1367 , cortese et al .",
    "2006 ) . two giant galaxies and several dwarfs / extragalactic hii regions , together with an extended ( @xmath56150 kpc ) wake of ionized gas ,",
    "were observed in a compact group infalling towards the cluster centre .",
    "both ram - pressure stripping and galaxy - galaxy interactions are extremely efficient in this case . due to their lower velocity dispersion compared to clusters , galaxy groups are actually the natural site for tidal interactions .",
    "this group is furthermore not isolated , but moving with a high velocity ( @xmath201700 km / s ) in the icm of a1367 ( cortese et al .",
    "note that the simulation presented in this work is not representative for high velocity encounters / mergers in the central regions of galaxy clusters . here",
    "additional effects , like galaxy harassment , play an important role . on the other hand the ram pressure increases with the icm density and the square of the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the icm .",
    "therefore the effect of ram pressure stripping increases in the denser regions of galaxy clusters . the relative strength and the interplay of ram pressure in high velocity encounters will be investigated in an upcoming paper .",
    "in order to investigate the influence of the ram pressure on interacting galaxies , we compared the results of a simulation of an interaction with and without a constant wind .",
    "we focus on the evolution of the star formation rate of the interacting system and on the distribution of the different baryonic components ( i.e. gas and stars ) .",
    "the results can be summarised as follows :    * the star formation rate of the interaction is enhanced in the presence of an ambient hot ( 3kev ) and rare medium ( @xmath57g/@xmath1 ) together with ram pressure by a factor of three in comparison to the same interaction without the ambient medium . *",
    "the morphology of the interacting system is strongly distorted .",
    "the tidal tails and the bridge between the interacting system are completely destroyed by the ram pressure .",
    "the resulting gas and stellar mass distributions of the two galaxies would not be characterised by observers as interacting system after the first close encounter . *",
    "the amount of gas in the wake of the interacting system is 50% of the total gas mass of the interacting system after 500 myr of ram pressure acting on it .",
    "approximately 10 - 15% of the gas is heated up to temperatures above @xmath41k , which would be observable in x - rays .",
    "* after 500 myr of ram pressure @xmath58 of all newly formed stars are formed in the wake of the interacting system at distances larger than 20 kpc behind the stellar disc in the case of the face on ram pressure .",
    "the same behaviour can be observed in the case of the edge on ram pressure .",
    "* as the tidal tails and the gaseous bridge between the interacting system feel the ram pressure , knots of cold gas ( @xmath59k ) start to form and these irregular structures start to form new stars .",
    "these knots are found to contain several @xmath6 m@xmath7 of cold gas and newly formed stars .",
    "they can be classified as stripped baryonic dwarf galaxies .",
    "the lifetime of these stripped baryonic dwarfs is limited by turbulence and heat conduction .",
    "if the objects are in the slipstream of the disc galaxies , they can survive for a several hundred myrs up to a gyr . as the ram pressure in the gaseous wake is decreasing due to the decreasing relative velocities , the timescales for kelvin - helmholtz instabilities is increasing as well , therefore extending the lifetime of these objects .",
    "thermal conduction is affecting stripped baryonic dwarfs as well , but the low densities of the surrounding icm seems to result in evaporation timescales at least larger than 500 myrs .",
    "concluding we found that interacting galaxies affected by a moderate ram pressure show a completely different behaviour compared to the case of no ram pressure acting on them .",
    "the simulations presented in this work are idealised in order to be able to distinguish between different effects .",
    "as galaxies move through a real cluster , the ram pressure changes and complex interactions with the cluster potential and other galaxies are present .",
    "these factors will be investigated in upcoming papers .",
