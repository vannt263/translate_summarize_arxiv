    "a common feature of topological systems is the existence of gapless edge modes protected by a topological invariant quantity such as the chern number and @xmath0 index @xcite .",
    "this quantity distinguishes a nontrivial topological system from a trivial ( non - topological ) one .",
    "however , the transition between the two regimes requires a gap closing point which signifies a topological critical point @xcite . in many systems",
    "a topological critical point is another nontrivial state .",
    "for instance , weyl semimetals @xcite can be considered as an intermediate state between three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological and trivial insulators .",

    "quite recently , the extension of topological concepts to nonelectronic bosonic systems such as magnons @xcite and phonons @xcite is a rapidly developing field with interesting features .",
    "unlike electronic systems these bosonic quasi - particles are charge - neutral and they do not exhibit a quantized conductivity , which makes them potential candidates to design systems with less dissipation and good coherent transport . in ordered quantum magnets",

    "the resulting magnon dispersions @xcite have similar features to topological insulators in electronic systems @xcite .",
    "the dmi is present in magnetic materials that lack an inversion center .",
    "the kagom lattice is built with this structure , because the midpoint of the bonds connecting two nearest - neighbour magnetic ions is not a center of inversion .",
    "this leads to topological magnon effects in ferromagnetic kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "a broken inversion center is also present on the honeycomb lattice between the midpoints of second nearest - neighbour magnetic ions .",

    "as we pointed out above , the crucial point to note in this model is that the magnetic field induces two spin components parallel and perpendicular to the field .",
    "the reason for allowing an in - plane dmi is as follows : suppose we allowed only the out - of - plane dmi @xmath117 , it is clear that the corresponding magnon dispersions can not recover the zero magnetic field collinear nel order with dmi because eq",
    ".   will vanish at zero magnetic field .",
    "this is contrary to zero field spin hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "the point is that at low temperatures the dmi has a significant effect on the spin wave spectrum only when the magnetic order is along the same direction as the dmi .",
    "therefore , in order to recover the dispersion of the collinear nel order in the @xmath86-@xmath96 plane at zero magnetic field we must allow an in - plane dmi that would contribute to the field - induced in - plane spin components .",
    "this argument does not mean that the magnetic order determines the direction of the dmi , but it means that if we want of see the effects of dmi on the spin wave spectrum the magnetic order should be parallel to the direction of the dmi .",
    "in fact , the main purpose of having a magnetic field in the system is to align or ca nt the magnetic moments in the desired directions of the dmi @xcite .",

    "the trivial insulator with vanishing chern number is not adiabatically connected to the system with zero dmi or vacuum .",
    "the resulting effect is that @xmath187 is finite in both the trivial and nontrivial regimes , despite the absence of magnon edge modes and chern number in the former .",

    "it has also been confirmed that the inclusion of a third nearest neighbour suppresses @xmath187 in each regime .",
    "the hall conductivity is negative and never changes sign because the chern number of the bulk bands is either @xmath198 in the topological regime or @xmath199 in the trivial insulating regime . at low temperatures",
    "the lower band is more populated at @xmath200 ( bose condensation ) than the upper band and the berry curvature can be expanded near @xmath200 .",

    "the conductivity can also be computed for the parallel to field spin components of honeycomb antiferromagnets , but it does not show a linear temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "in contrast to weyl magnons@xcite with finite thermal hall conductivity @xcite , quasi-2d magnonic dirac points do not possess thermal hall conductivity unless a gap opens .",
    "therefore , the perpendicular to field spin components and the frustrated magnets show vanishing thermal hall effect .",
    "possible experimentally accessible materials are listed in the introduction .",
    "the bosonic nature of quantum magnetic excitations makes optical lattices an indispensable reliable mediums to experimentally probe nontrivial properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "the optical lattice mechanism has been utilized effectively in the realization of artificial vector gauge potential for neutral bosonic particles trapped in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to generate fictitious magnon phases by trapping ferromagnetic magnon or bose atoms in an optical lattice @xcite as implemented in the electronic version of haldane model @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this model makes these approaches very promising . to realize bosonic cold atoms in this model , it is worth pointing out that the connection between spin-@xmath153 quantum magnets and bosonic systems can be achieved via the matsubara - matsuda transformation @xmath203 @xcite , where @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators respectively .",

    "this model is the bosonic version of the magnonic system in eq .",
    "[ mod ] and it represents a system of bose gas interacting via a potential @xcite . in this system",
    "the topological magnon phase for @xmath172 can be attributed to a topological superfluid phase , whereas the trivial magnon insulator phase for @xmath54 could be a non - topological mott phase and the critical point @xmath62 is the topological phase transition . a superfluid - mott insulator transition has been previously realized in a non - topological bosonic optical lattice @xcite .",
    "thus , the present model can be designed in a gas of ultracold bosonic atoms at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite , and distortion can be created by anisotropic laser potential .",
    "an alternative model with similar phase transition is the hardcore - bose - hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "in quantum magnetic systems that lack an inversion center the spin - orbit coupling dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) is present . in this report",
    ", we have shown that quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic systems with collinear and non - collinear magnetic long - range order exhibit gapless cone - like dirac magnon dispersion unaffected by the dmi .",
    "they are dubbed `` _ _ magnonic dirac semimetals _ _ '' and they occur with at least two magnon dispersions .",
    "one of the simple realistic ways to observe _ magnonic dirac semimetal _ is by using a magnetic field to regulate the magnetic moments .",
    "indeed , when the magnetic moments are perpendicular to the dmi no gap opens in the magnon dispersions .",
    "a good example is the kagome ferromagnet cu(1,3-bdc ) with small interlayer coupling @xcite . at zero magnetic field",
    "the magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically on the kagom plane whereas the dmi points out - of - plane . in this scenario",
    "the out - of - plane dmi does not make a topological contribution to the in - plane magnetic moment excitations and no topological gap was observed at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the system remains gapless in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field which obviously keeps the magnetic moments on the kagom plane . in principle , an in - plane dmi would contribute to the in - plane magnetic moments and it might open a gap , however no sizeable in - plane dmi was observed in cu(1,3-bdc ) , only an out - of - plane dmi @xmath218 was observed @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the in - plane spin components in the honeycomb antiferromagnets which show no topological magnon gaps as presented above . in other words",
    ", one might conclude that the dmi macroscopically breaks time - reversal symmetry of the magnon dispersions only when the magnetic moments are pointing out - of - plane in the direction of the dmi .",
    "the spin-@xmath153 kagom ferromagnetic mineral haydeeite , @xmath12-mgcu@xmath5(od)@xmath9cl@xmath8 also shows no finite - energy gaps in the observed spin - wave spectrum @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the dmi does not play a significant role in haydeeite .",
    "but it is possible that the magnetic moments are perpendicular to the dmi , which leads to no gap opening in the spin wave spectrum . for frustrated magnets , the spin - wave spectrum of a kagom antiferromagnet ",
    "potassium fe - jarosite kfe@xmath5(oh)@xmath13(so@xmath14)@xmath8 has also been measured @xcite with no evidence of topological magnon dispersions .",
    "it would be interesting to re - examine the observed spin - wave spectra of these materials in the context of _ magnonic dirac semimetal_. the chiral edge modes provide magnon transport on the edge of the materials , however they have not been measured at the moment .",
    "they require edge sensitive methods such as light @xcite or electronic @xcite scattering method .",
    "these systems can also be realized in optical lattices by trapping magnons or bose gases in laser beam potentials .",
