    "the problem of saturation of nuclear forces is nearly as old as nuclear physics but is not yet satisfactorily resolved theoretically .",
    "the first efforts to explain the saturation in terms of nuclear forces was the combination of a nonexchange ( wigner ) and a space - exchange ( majorana ) part . it is found that a majorana exchange of four times the strength of the wigner part is required.@xcite this disagrees with experimental scattering data . these early studies assumed a `` well - behaved '' potential such that perturbation theory could be used .",
    "the subsequent finding that the @xmath8 phase - shift changes sign at about 250 @xmath9 led jastrow@xcite to propose a very strong short ranged repulsion , a `` hard core '' .",
    "this it seemed would also help to explain the saturation property of nuclear matter at least qualitatively . a short ranged repulsion although soft rather than hard has since been part of all modern potentials and is theoretically justified .",
    "the strong nature of the nuclear forces does however exclude a low order perturbation approach as the short - ranged repulsion leads to strong short ranged correlations .",
    "the way out of this dilemma was led by brueckner some 50 years ago developping the theory bearing his name .",
    "his approach to solving nuclear many - body problems has dominated all aspects of nuclear physics since , be it nuclear structure or nuclear matter .",
    "the problem of nuclear saturation is _ qualitatively solved applying this theory with modern nuclear forces .",
    "the saturation is found to result from a combination of the properties of the two - body nucleon force ( being repulsive at short distances , being state - dependent and having a tensor - component ) and many body effects ( correlation effects related to pauli and dispersion effects ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the contribution from three - body forces is also important .",
    "_    although the problem of the saturation of nuclear forces may be partially resolved with experimentally and theoretically well motivated two- and three- body forces it is still unclear whether the discrepancies found are due to incomplete knowledge of the `` free '' nuclear forces , the effective interactions in nuclei , nucleonic degrees of freedom or relativistic effects etc .",
    "the major topic of the present work is related to our incomplete knowledge of the short - range details of the nn - force as opposed to the long - ranged pion - exchange part . in the `` new '' approach to the nuclear many - body problem",
    "the short - ranged part is integrated out with the goal of reducing the many body problem to that of a low- ( or even first- ) order problem and eliminating the need of brueckner or related many - body techniques . in the present work",
    "we show the effect on correlations and on saturation as a result of the typical cut - offs in momentum space suggested by this approach .",
    "we use brueckner s theory of nuclear matter for our calculations .",
    "the central part of this theory is the reaction matrix @xmath10 ( we use brueckner s original notation @xmath10 rather than the often used @xmath11 to avoid confusion with green s function ) , defined by @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the `` free '' nn - interaction , @xmath14 the in - medium propagator and where @xmath15 is the pauli - operator and @xmath16 is a sum of kinetic and self - consistent mean field energies @xmath17 the calculations below use this definition of @xmath18 for both hole and particle states usually referred to as the `` continuous '' choice . the brueckner expression for the total energy",
    "is given by @xmath19 the many - body effects of brueckner s theory are clearly expressed in the moszkowski - scott separation method @xcite .",
    "one particularly important effect as regards saturation is the dispersion correction .",
    "@xmath10 will have off - energy shell contributions due to the momentum dependence of the mean field binding @xmath20 and this is the origin of this correction .",

    "the dispersion correction to the energy per particle @xmath27 is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the density .",
    "the dispersion term is small at low density ( small finite nuclei ) but grows with density because of the increased binding .",
    "it is repulsive and is therefore an important contribution to saturation .",
    "it is basically a three - body effect as the effective two - body interaction depends on the mean field due to the presence of `` third nucleons '' that constitute the mean field @xmath18 .",
    "the wound - integral @xmath23 is an important quantity by itself being a measure of the correlation strengths .",
    "a good understanding of the origin of the dispersion correction is of particular interest with the present `` new '' approach to the nuclear many - body problem using eft or similar ideas . in the @xmath31 approximation with @xmath32 ,",
    "short - ranged correlations are _  priori ignored and a nuclear matter calculation gives no saturation , unless supplemented with a three - body interaction of not well - defined origin . in the eft - approach a low - energy effective interaction is derived but a three - body force is simultaneously generated and may contribute to saturation .",
    "this three - body force is however of different origin than the above mentioned dispersion - effect which is a medium or many - body - effect .",
    "it is of course now generally accepted that the _ bona fide three - body force is also large enough to be an important factor in understanding the saturation . _",
    "_    the main subject of this paper is to look at the effect of typical momentum cut - offs related to eft and @xmath31 and how it relates to two - body correlations in nuclear matter and saturation calculations .",

    "it may be of interest to note that calculations with the hamada - johnston potential showed a substantial increase of @xmath5 with density @xcite increasing from @xmath123 at @xmath124 to @xmath125 at @xmath126 a reflection of the fact that the short - ranged structure of this potential is quite different .",

    "it is seen that the @xmath5 for the @xmath8 state is only slightly smaller for @xmath63 than for @xmath62 but the dispersion corrections are quite different because of the different cutoffs .    an additional factor to consider in this discussion",
    "is that the correlations in the medium i.e. the @xmath5 s also depend on the chosen mean field that of course is the origin of the off - shell scatterings .",

    "he reports a total @xmath130 for the bonn - b potential with a continuous spectrum .",

    "comparison with brueckner calculations shows a decrease in binding very similar to what is seen in fig .",
    "[ holehole]@xcite .",
    "this can be regarded as a relatively small correction and shows near cancellation of the different effects mentioned above . _",
    "this extension of brueckner s original theory does however not address other higher order effects that may affect two - body correlations and saturation .",
    "one issue is for example alternative insertions in particle lines that would affect the @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) for the dispersion correction .",
    "a rigorous treatment of these insertions was made by bethe who realised that they should be treated as 3-body collisions @xcite .",
    "it has however been claimed by song _",
    "et al @xcite that all three - hole line contributions are essentially included if the continuous choice of the spectrum is used as we have also done here . _",
    "we believe that there are still uncertainties relating to both the nn - interaction at short distances including the tensor component and in the neglect of higher order corrections in the mamy - body theory .",
    "another issue is of course 3-body forces that we have not included in this work .",
    "the present evaluation of corrections discussed above does however not alter our main conclusions regarding saturation and the cut - off parameter @xmath46 although it can not be ruled out that our values of @xmath5 can be slightly changed by improved computing techniques @xcite .",
    "this should be investigated .",
    "it was however shown that the brueckner result in eq .",
    "[ kappa - ave ] agrees with the green s function result if using the eqp- ( extended quasi - particle- ) approximation for the spectral function .",
    "( 66 ) in ref .",
    "many - body calculations with realistic nuclear forces have a long history .",
    "various methods have been used : brueckner , @xmath166 , coupled cluster , hnc and maybe others .",
    "these more or less agree in that realistic 2-body forces and a plausible 3-body force can provide reasonable saturation of nuclear matter and experimental fits to the lightest nuclei .",
    "the effective `` in - medium '' 2-body force is density - dependent and the 3-body force can also be regarded as an effective density - dependent 2-body force . without any reference to a specific theory one",
    "can therefore conclude that the effective force in the nuclear medium has to be density - dependent in order to achieve the observed saturation .",
    "the origin of this density - dependence is however only partially understood theoretically .",
    "the philosophy behind the @xmath31 and eft methods is that the relative momenta of nucleons in nuclei are low and that the high - momentum components of the nn - interaction therefore should be allowed to be integrated out since they are not well known anyway .",
    "the result is a renormalised `` smooth '' effective force that may even be treated in low order perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath31 effective force does in itself not provide saturation and has to be supplemented with a @xmath167 force of not well defined origin.@xcite the effective force generated by eft - methods does explicitly generate a 3-body force but apparently not sufficiently strong to provide saturation .    in brueckner theory",
    "the effective force is obtained by replacing the free space propagator @xmath168 in the nuclear medium by @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 operator as well as the mean field included in the energy - denominator @xmath16 contribute to the density - dependence . the momentum - dependent ( non - local ) mean field results in off - shell scatterings in the many - body medium which together with short - ranged correlations yields a dispersion term ( eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) ) which is density - dependent .",
    "this is a major contributor to the density - dependence of the effective force in brueckner theory .",
    "the range of the correlations contributing to this density - dependence is typically long ( in momentum space ) compared to the fermi - momentum and to the typical cut - offs used to produce the renormalised low - momentum effective forces .",
    "the question addressed in this paper is which effect the cut - off has on the density - dependence and consequently the saturation and the compressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "the study is done with a separable potential derived by previously published inverse scattering methods .",
    "@xcite the input consists of the scattering phase - shifts and the deuteron data .",
    "the effect of the cut - off of the high momentum phase - shifts on the effective interaction was shown in a previous publication @xcite and the similarity with @xmath31 was shown . in the present work",
    "a primary interest has been the dispersion effects .",
    "the effect of the cut - offs on the dispersion correction was shown in figs 1 - 2 .",
    "it is found that at normal saturation density a cut - off larger than about @xmath169 is necessary to include the full effect of the correlations on dispersion and the saturation property of the force .",
    "we reaffirm the importance of tensor - correlations in section iii .",
    "they are not fully defined by the scattering phase - shifts but the deuteron properties are important inputs .",
    "it was already shown by machleidt @xcite that deuteron wave - functions constrained by the known deuteron quadrupole moment and the asymptotic d / s ratio but having different unknown d - state probabilities give different saturation results.@xcite this was confirmed by the inverse scattering results of kwong and khler @xcite , who further investigated the effect on saturation using three additional model wave - functions for the deuteron .",
    "the d - state admixture is largely unknown for momenta above @xmath170 .",
    "this leaves a major uncertainty in the theory of saturation .",
    "it is now generally accepted that an important part of the density - dependence comes from 3-body forces .",
    "it seems however that at least part of the unknown factor regarding saturation rests with two - body correlations especially in the @xmath48 channel . because of this uncertainty it seems reasonable to look for alternatives .",
    "one such is the moscow - potential of neudatchin _ et al @xcite that has a strong short - ranged attraction that changes the phase - shifts by an unobservable amount of @xmath171 radians resulting in a node in the relative wavefunction .",
    "this leads to a strongly correlated short - ranged system resulting in larger wound - integrals and dispersion corrections .",
    "if the tensor force is not sufficient to give sufficient saturation this force may be the right answer to the saturation problem .",
    "_    we have here only been concerned with the effect of correlations and momentum cut - offs in nuclear matter calculations .",
    "a somewhat different problem is that of the effect of cut - offs for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "it is however shown in fig .",
    "[ satfig4 ] that for densities below the saturation density , the total binding energy is practically independent of cut - off at least for @xmath172 .",
    "this suggests that short - ranged correlation effects may be of less importance in finite nuclei as long as saturation is not an issue , i.e. if the density distribution is constrained by fixing the nucler size . if not",
    ", the calculation would result in a finite nucleus collapsing to a too small radius .",
    "one motivation to develop low momentum effective interactions has been that it might be used in low order perturbation theory as opposed to the more traditional many - body techniques developped for strongly interacting media . @xcite in fig .",
    "[ br1st2nd ] are shown four different curves .",
    "these are results of two brueckner , one first and one second order calculation of nuclear matter binding energies , the latter with a cut - off @xmath63 . as expected there is no sign of saturation for @xmath63 .",
    "this was already seen to be the case for the brueckner calculation with @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ satfig4 ] .",
    "however , the second order result shows a considerable improvement over the first order at densities below saturation approaching the brueckner result with the same @xmath46 .",
