    "waveguides are brought together adiabatically through a bending region , a phase term must be added in the argument of the sine function . in order to have complete separation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of a light beam , the following condition must be fulfilled : @xmath82 with @xmath83 odd and @xmath31 integer .",

    "these theoretical findings are in agreement with our experimental results obtained using fs - written elliptical waveguide arrays .",
    "it was also possible to determine the refractive index contrast between the core and the cladding of the waveguides .",
    "the experimentally obtained parameters were used to analyze the value of the localization volume depending on the degree of disorder . consistently , the localization volume for a fixed disorder degree is smaller for vertically polarized light , indicating that this type of polarization produces a stronger localization although this effect tends to vanish , as expected , in the strong anderson localization regime .",

    "is required to observe localization in 2d lattices @xcite , the whole picture will be scaled up and the different polarizations will essentially show the same .",
    "the transition to localization in 1d is more abrupt and , therefore , the different polarizations really experience different dynamics .    finally , our model , which provides a link between the geometry of the waveguides , the polarization of light and the coupling constants , allowed us to find a feasible experimental configuration to produce a compact and balanced pbs that is useful for many quantum information tasks .",
