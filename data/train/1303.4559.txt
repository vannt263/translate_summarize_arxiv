    "we consider the cauchy problem for the scalar integro - differential equation @xmath2 the model describes the slow erosion of granular flow , where @xmath3 is the height of the standing profile of granular matter .",
    "we assume that the slope of the profile has a fixed sign , i.e. , @xmath4 , and granular matter is poured at a constant rate from an uphill location outside the interval of interest , and slides down the hill as a very thin layer .",
    "the interaction between the two layers is controlled by the erosion function @xmath5 , which denote the rate of the mass being eroded ( or deposited if negative ) per unit length travelled in @xmath6 direction per unit mass passing through .",
    "we assume that the erosion rate @xmath5 depends only on the slope @xmath7 . at the critical slope @xmath8 ( normalized ) , we have @xmath9 .",

    "we will still refer to @xmath14 as `` time '' throughout the paper , and call @xmath15 the `` initial data '' .",
    "the model was first derived in @xcite as the slow erosion limit of a @xmath16 model for granular flow proposed by hadeler & kuttler in @xcite , with a specific erosion function @xmath17 .",
    "later on , more general classes of erosion functions were studied , making distinction between whether the slope @xmath7 blows up or remains uniformly bounded .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the slope",
    ". under the following assumptions on the erosion function @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 the slope @xmath22 remains uniformly bounded for all @xmath23 , see @xcite . in this case , one could study the following conservation law for @xmath22 , @xmath24 here the flux contains an integral term in @xmath6 . due to",
    "the nonlinearity of the function @xmath25 , jumps in @xmath22 could develop in finite time even for smooth initial data , which leads to kinks in the profile @xmath26 .",
    "thanks to the uniform bound on @xmath22 , global existence and uniqueness of bv solutions for are established in @xcite .    however ,",
    "if we allow more erosion for large slope , the solutions behave very differently .",
    "if the erosion function approaches a linear function for large @xmath22 , i.e , if is replaced by @xmath27 then the slope @xmath22 could blow up , leading to vertical jumps in the profile , and @xmath28 would contain point masses .",
    "in this case one must study the equation .",
    "it is observed in @xcite that 3 types of singularities may occur in the solutions of , namely    * a kink , where @xmath7 is discontinuous ; * a jump , where @xmath26 is discontinuous ; * a hyper - kink , where @xmath26 is continuous , but the right limit of @xmath7 is infinite , or both left and right limits of @xmath7 are infinite .    the global existence of bv solutions for is obtained in @xcite , through a modified version of front tracking algorithm which generates piecewise affine approximations that also allow discontinuities .",
    "we remark that , model differs from other integro - differential equations in the literature where the gradient @xmath7 may blow up .",
    "for example , the variational wave equation @xcite and the camassa - holm equation @xcite are both well - studied . in both cases , thanks to an a - priori bound on the @xmath29 norm of @xmath30 , the solution @xmath26 remains hlder continuous at all times .",
    "in contrast , the solutions to our equation could develop jumps , and the distributional derivative @xmath7 could contain point masses .    since @xmath31 is an increasing function in @xmath6 ,",
    "the inverse @xmath32 is well - defined .",
    "we define the corresponding gradient @xmath33 formal computation shows that @xmath32 and @xmath34 are conserved quantities , and they satisfy the equations @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the erosion function in the coordinates @xmath37 , representing the rate of erosion per unit mass passed per unit distance in @xmath26 . from the properties of @xmath5 in and , the function @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39    note that , for a given @xmath14 , when @xmath40 on an interval in @xmath26 , the physical slope @xmath41 blows up to infinity , and the profile @xmath31 has a vertical jump .",
    "however , the solutions for could become negative , which have no physical meaning .",
    "therefore equation must be equipped with the pointwise constraint @xmath42 .",
    "we now modify equation into @xmath43 the measure @xmath44 in yields the projection into the cone of non - negative functions .",
    "therefore , we `` transformed '' the point mass in @xmath45 into constraint in @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that the projection reduces the @xmath46 distance between solutions @xmath34 .",
