    "quinlan & shapiro ( 1989 ) developed a fokker - planck model of a spherically symmetric , dense cluster of compact stars , and found `` rapid buildup of massive black holes in the cluster core resulting from successive binary mergers and mass segregation . '' subsequently , they studied clusters of solar - mass stars and found `` it is remarkably easy for massive stars to form through multiple stellar mergers in dense galactic nuclei '' ( quinlan & shapiro , 1990 ; hereafter qs ) .    the goal of this project is to generalise the qs approach to two dimensions in order to answer the question : what about rotation ?",
    "the hoped - for answer is that mergers and mass segregation can still produce a massive object ( perhaps @xmath2 ) in the core of the cluster , which could then undergo growth via accretion to reach supermassive size ( @xmath3 ) within a hubble time ( _ e.g. _ , david _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) and be seen as an agn .",
    "because of the non - spherical nature of our model , it is not possible to use @xmath4 as our integrals of the motion as previous two - dimensional work has done ( cohn 1979 ) .",
    "instead we use radial ( @xmath5 ) and tangential ( @xmath6 ) action variables , which are adiabatic invariants as the potential evolves .",
    "orbit - averaging is then truly a simple average of quantities over the @xmath7 change in ( an ) angle variable .",
    "the orbit - averaged fokker - planck equation then takes a particularly simple form : @xmath8+{1\\over2 } { \\partial^2\\over\\partial i_i\\partial i_j}[f_n\\left<\\delta i_i\\delta i_j\\right > ] -l_n+g_n - b_n+r_n\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are the distribution functions for stars of mass - type @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the drift and diffusion coefficients .",
    "@xmath12 are ad - hoc terms to account for losses and gains due to stellar mergers , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the analogous paramters for stellar evolution . summation over repeated dummy indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 is implied .",
    "the coefficient calculation ( partially derived by tremaine and weinberg , 1984 , and by van vleck , 1926 , in different contexts ) involves expanding the potential in action space and summing over the entire distribution @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 in the above , @xmath20 are the orbital frequencies , _",
    "@xmath21 , and the @xmath22 are integers labelling different coefficients @xmath23 in the expansion of the potential in action space .",
    "subscript @xmath24 signifies `` bar '' , but should be understood to represent any individual element of the potential , _",
    "e.g. , _ that of one particular `` field '' star .    the fokker - planck approximation remains valid as long as number @xmath25 , and requires that the time step @xmath26 satisfy @xmath27 .",
    "we have dynamical time @xmath28 , and relaxation time @xmath29 or more .",
    "we must iteratively solve for the self - consistent potential @xmath30 after each fokker - planck time step . to allow for non - sphericity",
    ", we first calculate the ellipticity @xmath31 from the overall net rotational velocity using the virial theorem ( binney & tremaine , 1987 ) . to make the problem tractable",
    ", it is assumed that isodensity surfaces are all of this common ellipticity .",
    "the density is thus expressed in terms of the homeoidal radial coordinate @xmath32 : @xmath33 in which @xmath34 denotes the mass of star type @xmath10 , and from which the new potential run can be calculated .",
    "this procedure is iterated until convergence is achieved , typically to @xmath35 , and accelerated by the aitken `` @xmath36 '' process ( henrici , 1964 ) . a final check of conservation of overall energy is also made .",
    "the @xmath37 grid is variable with each time step , with regions of larger @xmath38 and @xmath39 being given a greater density of grid points .",
    "the assumption of homeiodal isodensity surfaces , along with @xmath40 , determines the potential @xmath30 .",
    "the required integral , however , is too involved to be performed each time the knowledge of potential is needed in the fokker - planck coefficient calculation . after testing interpolation schemes and analytic approximations , only the clutton - brock self - consistent field method ( hernquist and ostriker , 1992 ) proved adequate in both accuracy and speed .",
    "the field method is tested at each timestep , and if sufficient accuracy can not be achieved with a reasonable number of expansion terms , the code falls back on direct integration .",
    "although some angular momentum is expected to be transported outwards via the effects of shear between the higher-@xmath20 inner regions and the lower-@xmath20 outer regions , we are appealing to a bar - like perturbation in the potential to do most of the angular momentum transfer .",
    "so , should the cluster be found to have become unstable to formation of a stellar bar ( _ i.e. _ , be found to satisfy a @xmath41-style instability criterion such as that of christodoulou _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) , a non - axisymmetric component is incorporated into the potential .",
    "combes & sanders ( 1981 ) found that bars form over 12 rotational periods , and last for many more ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this has led us to build the nonaxisymmetric potential from a fraction ( @xmath43 ) of the @xmath44 population that is forced to orbit in `` locked step '' , sharing a common orbital frequency and phase .",
    "we assume there is no transfer of stars from bar to field or vice versa .",
    "combes & elmegreen ( 1993 ) show that the bar frequency is a compromise of the orbital frequencies of its component stars , so our @xmath45 is set by conserving either the total energy or total angular momentum of those stars . allowing the bar distribution to evolve like",
    "the field stars avoids any problem of inserting the bar binding energy by hand .",
    "it is standard in this game to start with a plummer sphere distribution . to introduce rotation , we start with the rotation parameter @xmath46 , and `` shift '' the distribution of @xmath47 so that total @xmath48 matches desired @xmath49 while conserving number , so that the new @xmath50 for @xmath51 some @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "a typical @xmath55 value from cosmological tidal torques is @xmath560.05 ( barnes & efstathiou , 1987 ) .",
    "while this prescription does produce an overall rotation , it does so at the `` expense '' of the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath57 , _ i.e. _ , the fraction of radial orbits is enhanced and the tangential component of the kinetic energy is actually decreased . from a computational `` proof - of - concept ''",
    "point of view , however , this increase in radial orbits is an advantage as it plays into the density dependence of the gravitational relaxation .",
    "[ tb ]    figure 1 details the evolution of the potential run for @xmath58 clusters of @xmath44 stars .",
    "the initally plummer - like cluster shows no change over half of a central relaxation time ( @xmath59 yrs ) .",
    "unfortunately there was not time for a longer run prior to this meeting , but this demonstrates the stability of the staggered distribution / potential updating scheme .",
    "the modified cluster was run on a faster machine , so there was time to evolve it for @xmath60 central relaxation times . note how its potential starts out deeper and deepens more rapidly than that of the plummer cluster , as would be expected when radial orbits are more dominant and stars spend more time in the denser core where two - body relaxation has a greater effect .",
    "the corresponding densities are shown in figure 2 ; the breaks in @xmath61 are caused by insufficient resolution in the innermost region .",
    "we have demonstrated the stability of this method for modeling the evolution of a dense star cluster using the two - dimensional fokker - planck equation , but work needs to be done to balance keeping @xmath62 small while maintaining a reasonable time step @xmath26 .",
    "ways to accomplish this include allowing a variable @xmath26 when @xmath63 becomes too large ( which introduces its own issues of energy error ; these may be alleviated using the forced - time - symmetry technique described elsewhere in these proceedings by piet hut ) , or simply by throwing more cycles at the problem .",
    "we should also weight the small-@xmath64 grid more . on the physical side of the problem ,",
    "the initial conditions need to be chosen for higher @xmath65 ( a criticism of qs was that they chose initial conditions favouring massive object formation , but we should at least reproduce their result as a test case ) , and also not to cool @xmath57 when rotation is desired .",
    "the bar can then be `` turned on '' , as can the effects of stellar mergers and evolution .",
    "in the time between the kingston meeting and the proceedings deadline , some progress towards these goals has been made .",
    "the energy error has been found to be largely dependent upon the differencing scheme used for the distribution functions @xmath66 .",
    "the chang - cooper scheme , which in one dimension guarantees that a fokker - planck distribution will remain positive for any @xmath26 , does not generalise to 2-d ( essentially because the calculus of extrema becomes more complicated ) . for the meeting ,",
    "i used a chang - cooper - based method that overcompensated ( treating all derivatives as full ) but which in later tests proved unsatisfactory , as did undercompensating ( using partials ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of a simple fixed differencing weighted 90% towards the forward side , which allowed the @xmath44 case to run for more than two central relaxation times ( _ i.e. _ , over four times as long as before ) before @xmath62 reached @xmath43 .",
    "one can now see the beginnings of density increase in the core .",
    "also , the break in @xmath61 at @xmath67 pc has been almost eliminated by the use of a better - optimised @xmath37 grid .      the results for clusters of the same overall mass , but with a mix of 1- , 2- and 4-@xmath68 stars",
    "is shown in figure 4 . in this case",
    ", @xmath62 reached @xmath69 after just over one core relaxation time of @xmath70 had passed . here",
    "we see that both clusters have larger rates of central density increase than the equivalent all-@xmath44 clusters , and that the relative increase of the rate for the cluster with enhanced radial orbits ( quixotically labelled `` rot '' as described in  5 ) relative to the plummer - like one ( `` norot '' ) is much quicker than in the @xmath44 case .",
    "both of these differences are as expected when the evolution is dominated by two - body gravitational relaxation .",
    "in addition to the insightful support of my advisor george field , i would like to acknowledge bill press , charles gammie and ue - li pen for their advice , and ncsa for cycles .",
