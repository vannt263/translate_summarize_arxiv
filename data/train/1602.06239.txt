    "are examples of digital circles ( black ) approximating circles of radii 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 ( gray ) . with the exception of the 4-connected and signum algorithm ,",
    "most of the digital circle algorithms cited in the literature do not yield valid paths on @xmath0 ( black dotted ; see definition  [ def_validpath ] ) . ]    the analytical characterization and algebraic representation of circles have a long history , dating back many thousands of years . with the emergence of digital computing devices utilizing grid - based interfaces in the past century ,",
    "the fascination with circles and their algorithmic generation saw another drive which significantly contributed to the evolution of discrete mathematical domains such as digital calculus and digital geometry @xcite .",
    "the interest in digital circles transcends , however , beyond application - focused paradigms .",
    "for instance , in number theory , the still unsolved gauss s circle problem ( e.g. , see @xcite ) or the distribution of square numbers in discrete intervals @xcite are inherently linked to the representation of the euclidean circle on integer lattices . in physics , a related , though perhaps controversial point is the fevered search for a quantum theory of space ( and time ) , i.e. a discrete makeup of our world , which does ultimately lead to the rejection of the ideal real number line in favour of a discrete and finite ( or effinite , see @xcite ) mathematical underpinning of the very construct of reality .",
    "however , despite many advances in the past decades , a rigorous and applicable framework of a discrete finite , perhaps even ultra - finite , or effinite mathematics is still largely missing , not at least due to the combinatorial complexity inherent to such approaches .",
    "a great number of algorithms for the generation of digital circles is known in the literature ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . in complexity , these algorithms range from the incremental discretization of the implicit or parametric representation of the euclidean circle @xcite , the discretization of differential equations @xcite , sophisticted spline and polygonal approximations @xcite , to algorithms which utilize number - theoretical concepts @xcite .",
    "although all incremental algorithms utilize decision ( or cost ) functions , the concrete form of the latter , as well as their specific implementation , can lead to quite different representations of digital circles with the same radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) . moreover , with the exception of the 4-connected algorithm @xcite and the signum algorithm presented here , most of the used digital circle algorithms do not yield valid circular paths on the underlying 2-dimensional integer lattice . here",

    "this contrasts , for instance , the most widely used bresenham @xcite and midpoint @xcite algorithms , which deliver only about 70% of the points necessary for a valid circular path on @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , in contrast to many known digital circle algorithms , the computational implementation of the signum algorithm does not require decision trees or case distinctions , but solely relies on the signum function to generate a valid path .",
    "such an algebraic formulation has the advantage of being mathematical tractable and allowing for rigorous manipulations .",

    "the computational complexity of the digital circle algorithm presented in proposition  [ prop_signumalgorithm ] is carried by the argument of the cost function , which requires to evaluate the square root of integer numbers . however , as we show below , due to the properties of the signum function , @xmath71 can be significantly simplified . to that end",
    ", we first formulate    [ lemma_sgn ] the signum function @xmath66 with @xmath72 is subject to the following property : @xmath73 for all @xmath74 and strict monotonically increasing functions @xmath75 .",

    ", we have the following inequality @xmath107 from which @xmath108 @xmath109 follows . with this , we can rewrite ( [ eq_costsimplified ] ) , using again lemma  [ lemma_sgn ] , and obtain @xmath110 observing that @xmath111 @xmath112 , we then expand , for @xmath113 , the argument of @xmath79 in a power series .",
    "this yields @xmath114 for large @xmath16 , the sum in the last equation converges rapidly , and we can approximate @xmath79 by taking only the leading term @xmath115 into consideration , thus showing ( [ eq_costapproximated ] ) .",
    "we note that , whereas ( [ eq_cost ] ) and ( [ eq_costsimplified ] ) provide exact expressions for the cost function @xmath79 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_costapproximated ] ) provides an approximation which , for @xmath116 , yields the same result as the exact expressions .",
    "however , using ( [ eq_costapproximated ] ) will significantly lower the computational cost of constructing a digital circle , as here only integer operations are involved .",
    "finally , we remark that both the exact alternative form of the cost function ( [ eq_costsimplified ] ) and its approximation ( [ eq_costapproximated ] ) are no longer given in terms of the coordinates @xmath98 of points along the circular path @xmath20 , but instead are functions of the manhattan distance @xmath117 of each point @xmath118 to the center of the circle .",
    "the resulting finite sequence itself is subject to a recursion , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_anrec ] ) , and will be used in the next section to recover the numerical value of @xmath2 from a digital circle @xmath54 .",
    "by construction , each digital circle algorithm delivers , for any given radius @xmath16 , a set of points on @xmath0 which , for increasing @xmath16 , approximates with increasing precision @xmath18 when each pair of nearest neighbouring points is connected with a straight line in @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) , eventually yielding @xmath21 for @xmath119 .",
    "however , if we restrict to @xmath0 with its @xmath1-norm , all valid circular paths will remain finitely distinct from @xmath21 even in the asymptotic case , as each path is bound to the lattice . to make matters worse ,",
    "if we consider the distance of each point along the circular path to the origin , then we find that it is no longer constant .",
    "this , although being a known characteristic with amusing consequences of geometric spaces endowed with @xmath1-norm @xcite , it is in direct conflict with the very original definition of a circle as put forth in euclid s _ elements _ ( book i ,  19 ) .",
    "if we adhere to euclid s circle definition in such a discrete space with @xmath1-norm , on the other hand , the discrete circle takes , in the continuum limit , the shape of a square rotated by @xmath97 .",
    "thus , in other words , a _ digital _ circle and a _ discrete _ circle are two distinct geometrical objects .",
    "digital geometry defines a `` digital circle '' simply as a discrete approximation ( or digitized model ) of a circle in @xmath3 obtained by searching for points on @xmath0 which are closest to @xmath21 .",
    "naturally , the form of each model will carry consequences for its underlying relationship to the circle on @xmath3 .",
    "we can thus interrogate the geometric properties of each model in @xmath0 and @xmath3 , specifically , explore the relationship between properties of the digital circle @xmath54 , i.e. a circular path in a discrete space endowed with @xmath1-norm , and the properties of @xmath18 , i.e. a circle in a continuous space endowed with @xmath36-norm .",
    "we will focus here on the defining constant of circles , @xmath2 , and show below that the parametric and polar discretizations of the circle lead to an overestimate for @xmath2 , measured both numerically and analytically , whereas the signum algorithm introduced in section  [ s_signumalgorithm ] allows to recover its correct value in a somewhat surprising fashion .    before outlining the details of this interrogation , we note that , firstly , an alternative , and mathematically more rigorous , definition of a circle in @xmath3 is given by its parametric representation . specifically , a circle @xmath18 is the set of all points @xmath120 which satisfy the algebraic relation @xmath121 where @xmath122 is called the radius of the circle . recalling proposition  [ prop_signumalgorithm ] ,",
    "a digital circle @xmath54 is the set of all points @xmath123 satisfying a specific recursive algebraic relation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq_s1algorithm ] ) in the upper right quadrant .",
    "secondly , although differences exist in the mathematical representation of the algorithmic search for points on @xmath0 closest to @xmath21 , each digital circle algorithm utilizes the euclidean norm in one form or another in its minimization criterion .",
    "the same holds for the signum algorithm presented here .",
    "however , the resulting cost function ( [ eq_costsimplified ] ) and its approximation ( [ eq_costapproximated ] ) are given in terms of @xmath81 , which corresponds , in the upper right quadrant , to the manhattan distance of the point @xmath118 to the origin .",
    "taking both arguments together , it could be contended that the `` digital circle '' constructed by the signum algorithm is not only a digital model of @xmath18 , but a valid discrete model of a circle in @xmath0 , a space endowed with @xmath1-norm , with properties which , in the asymptotic limit , translate into those of @xmath21 .      to illustrate this crucial latter point , we will consider the defining constant of a circle in @xmath3 ( or hyperspheres in @xmath124 in general ) , namely @xmath2 , and ask whether @xmath2 can be obtained in a discrete space endowed with @xmath1-norm . to that end",
    ", we first recall how @xmath2 is obtained on @xmath3 by calculating the circumference of the circle .",
