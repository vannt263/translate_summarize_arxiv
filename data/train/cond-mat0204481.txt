    "single - molecule magnets ( smm s ) consist of identical molecules , each of which made up of several magnetic ions surrounded by many different species of atoms . a single molecule of the smm s mn@xmath1-acetate@xcite and fe@xmath0@xcite has an effective ground - state spin of @xmath4 and a strong crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "a zero - field energy barrier against magnetization reversal is approximately 65 k ( 30 k ) for uniaxial mn@xmath1 ( biaxial fe@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite despite their large effective spin , these single - molecule magnets have shown quantum coherence@xcite and quantum tunneling between the energy levels of the two potential wells.@xcite although dipolar interactions between different molecules are weak , in the low - temperature limit and near zero applied field , a dipolar interaction could stimulate the quantum tunneling and thus explain the non - exponential magnetization relaxation observed at early times.@xcite    recently , electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) experiments on single crystals of fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 have revealed interesting effects in the widths and positions of the epr peaks as functions of energy level , resonance frequency , and temperature when the applied field is along the easy axis .",
    "@xcite for both fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 , at fixed frequency , the linewidths increase with decreasing energy levels ( the largest linewidth corresponding to the transition between the ground state and the first excited state ) , and for a particular transition the linewidths increase with decreasing frequency . on the other hand , the details of the temperature dependence of the linewidths for the two materials are quite different . for mn@xmath1 ,",
    "the linewidths increase smoothly with increasing temperature , showing a rather weak temperature dependence . for fe@xmath0 , for transitions at low resonant fields , the linewidths increase sharply with temperature at low temperatures , reach a maximum , and then decrease slowly with temperature at higher temperatures .",
    "the exception is the transition associated with the ground state , for which the linewidth decreases with increasing temperature in the whole temperature range studied ( 2@xmath550 k ) . on the other hand , for the transitions with high resonant fields , the linewidths increase monotonically with increasing temperature . for fe@xmath0 ,",
    "the line positions change non - monotonically with energy level and temperature .    in ref . ,",
    "which was our first attempt to understand the energy level and resonance frequency dependence of the linewidths , we showed that for both single crystals of fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 the distribution in the uniaxial anisotropy parameter @xmath2 of the single - spin hamiltonian , caused by defects in the samples , contributes substantially to the inhomogeneous linewidths at constant temperature .",
    "this was also recently supported by terahertz spectroscopy for mn@xmath1.@xcite the microscopic origin of the distribution in @xmath2 has not yet been fully understood.@xcite the analysis further showed that for fe@xmath0 the dipolar interactions between molecules contribute to the linewidths as significantly as the distribution in @xmath2 , while for mn@xmath1 their contribution is less significant.@xcite in a recent millimeter - wave study on fe@xmath0,@xcite the dipolar field may have been overestimated because the distribution in @xmath2 was not included .    since the approximations made in ref .",
    "reasonably well explained the linewidth behavior at fixed temperature , in the present paper we investigate the temperature dependence of the linewidths and line positions . to explain this additional feature ,",
    "we take into account the inter - molecular spin - spin interactions ( exchange and dipolar ) , as well as distributions in the uniaxial anisotropy parameter @xmath2 and the land @xmath3-factor .",
    "we find that the distributions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 do not contribute to shifts in line positions with temperature , but the exchange and dipolar interactions produce nonzero local fields which are temperature dependent ( at low temperatures ) , so that they can make the line positions change with temperature .",
    "thus , to explain the _ temperature _ dependence of the measured line shifts , both the _ exchange _ and dipolar interactions are needed . without the exchange interaction , we can not explain the observed non - monotonic line shifts with temperature .",
    "this was not included in our earlier study , ref .. although the exchange interaction was not considered in our earlier study , its effect on the linewidths is negligible as long as the magnitude of the exchange constant is much smaller than the linewidths.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief summary of the experimental procedures is presented in sec .",
    "the models for fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 are described separately in sec .",
    "iv describes our calculated linewidths and line shifts vs temperature , and their discussed in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "our conclusions are provided in sec .",
    "all of the epr experiments were performed on single crystals with the magnetic field aligned along or close to the direction of the easy magnetization axis , in a temperature range from 2 k to 50 k. for mn@xmath1 , this direction coincides with that of the longest dimension of the essentially needle - shaped crystals . for fe@xmath0 ,",
    "the direction was determined by measurement of the largest spread of the resonant field , by rotating the crystal around the approximately known orientation of the easy axis .",
    "the single crystals were prepared as described earlier.@xcite epr measurements were made in the 100@xmath5190 ghz range with a resonant microwave cavity system described by hill et al.@xcite , which enables observation of distortion - free epr line shapes .",
    "the linewidths were determined by computer - fitting of the observed experimental spectra to either a gaussian or a lorentzian function for the spectra obtained at various temperatures .",
    "all the spectra were obtained by keeping the frequency fixed and sweeping the field to obtain the resonance peaks , as is usual in epr spectroscopy.@xcite",
    "for the examined single - crystal sample of fe@xmath0,@xcite there are two sources of the epr line _ shifts _ : temperature dependence of @xmath2 and the electronic spin - spin interactions ( dipolar and exchange interactions ) between different molecules .",
    "there are also two sources of the epr line _ broadening _ : the @xmath2-strain effect ( distribution in @xmath2 ) and the spin - spin interactions.@xcite for the examined mn@xmath1 sample,@xcite the sources of the line broadening are the @xmath2-strain , the @xmath3-strain,@xcite and the spin - spin interactions.@xcite    in our model , hyperfine interactions are not considered for the following reasons : ( i ) the observed line shifts and changes in the linewidths were much larger for fe@xmath0 than for mn@xmath1 .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , hyperfine fields are orders of magnitude larger for mn@xmath1 ( in which all nuclei have spins of @xmath6 ) than for fe@xmath0 ( 98% of fe nuclei with @xmath7 ) . (",
    "iii ) any residual effect of the hyperfine fields was included in background linewidths .",
    "possible mis - alignment of the external field and a spread in the in - plane fields are also not considered since mis - alignment of the external field can not provide the temperature dependence of the linewidths and shifts .",
    "we checked that for fe@xmath0 the effect of a distribution in the transverse anisotropy parameter @xmath8 on the linewidths was negligible .",
    "we also found that a spread in the in - plane fields ( possibly caused by nuclear spins ) can give rise to a distribution in the easy axis of each molecule , leading to asymmetries in epr lineshapes.@xcite    the model and technique used in this study are similar to those in ref .",
    ", except that we here take into account the non - spherical sample shapes and the actual crystal structures .",
    "therefore , we here summarize them only briefly , focusing on what causes the temperature dependence of the line shifts and linewidths for each source .",

    "the ground state is @xmath11 . for clarity",
    ", we discuss fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 separately .",
    "we consider an effective single - spin hamiltonian which satisfies approximate @xmath13 symmetry , @xmath14 where the uniaxial anisotropy parameter @xmath15 , the transverse anisotropy parameter @xmath16,@xcite @xmath3 is the land @xmath3-factor which is close to 2 , and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton . here @xmath18 is the @xmath19th component of the spin angular momentum operator , and @xmath20 is the longitudinal static applied magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the longitudinal magnetic field is applied along the easy axis ( the @xmath10 axis ) , and we ignore the small transverse anisotropy terms ( @xmath8 terms ) in calculating the linewidths .",
    "thus , the energy level @xmath21 is a good quantum number of the spin operator @xmath22 .",

    "next we calculate the average power absorption with a gaussian distribution in @xmath2 , where @xmath2 itself is assumed to be temperature independent . as a consequence ,",
    "the line broadening due to the @xmath2-strain effect becomes weakly temperature dependent because of the temperature dependence of the natural linewidths . to calculate the natural linewidths , we use the strength of the coupling between the spin system and a surrounding phonon heat bath obtained in ref .. for example , for @xmath9 , the order of magnitude of the natural linewidths is several to several tens of gauss at temperatures below several tens of kelvin , and the widths increase with decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "the spin - spin interactions are calculated separately with @xmath2 fixed , and then combined with the @xmath2-strain effect to obtain the total linewidths . at low temperatures , all energy levels are not equally populated , and the populations of the levels change with temperature according to the boltzmann factor .",
    "thus , the local field on a particular molecule caused by surrounding molecules changes with temperature .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath39 is much smaller than the dipolar and exchange interactions , which again are much smaller than the sum of the single - spin hamiltonians .",

    "[ fig : d+dp ] ) , confirming that the spin - spin interactions are essential to understanding the temperature dependence of the linewidths .",
    "the trends of the temperature dependence can be qualitatively understood through the relative magnitude difference of the thermal energy and the zeeman energy splitting between the states @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "if the zeeman energy splitting is much larger than the thermal energy ( this occurs at low temperatures ) , then the system is polarized .",
    "thus , higher temperature provides larger populations in higher energy levels within the same potential well where the ground state is located .",
    "this leads to an increase in the randomness of the spin orientation so that linewidths become larger with increasing temperature .",
    "if the zeeman energy splitting is much smaller than the thermal energy ( this occurs at high temperatures ) , then some energy levels in _ both _ potential wells are populated . in this case ,",
    "thermal fluctuations increase rapidly with increasing temperature , so that the duration time of the local magnetic field due to neighboring molecules becomes shorter than the spin - spin relaxation time @xmath130 ( the inverse of the natural linewidths ) .",
    "eventually , at very high temperatures the local field is averaged out . therefore , the linewidths decrease with increasing temperature , which usually occurs in paramagnetic materials with very small or zero single - ion anisotropy.@xcite ( this effect is called motional narrowing.@xcite ) therefore , the `` crossover '' temperature where the maximum of the linewidth occurs must be proportional to the zeeman energy splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath11 , which is @xmath131 . for example ,",
    "for the transition @xmath132 at @xmath83 ghz , the resonant field is less than 0.1 t , so the zeeman splitting is about 2@xmath133 .",
    "consequently , its crossover temperature is below the examined temperature range . the crossover temperature increases with decreasing @xmath21 because the resonances are observed at increasing fields for decreasing @xmath21 . for the transitions @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , the crossover temperatures are within the examined temperature range ( see the inset in fig .",
    "6 of ref . )",
    "for @xmath129 , and + 3 , the crossover temperatures are above the studied temperature range .",
    "figure  [ fig : d+dp ] shows the experimental data ( symbols ) , and our calculated linewidths ( curves ) , including both the @xmath2-strain effect and the spin - spin interactions with @xmath136 , @xmath124 gauss , @xmath137 gauss@xmath126 , and @xmath138 gauss@xmath126 .",
    "( the spread in @xmath2 here is different from that reported in ref . , because @xmath120 is sample dependent and the samples examined were different .",
    "the value of @xmath87 corresponding to an effective dipole distance of 12   ( fe@xmath0 ) in ref . was about 203 gauss@xmath126 . ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d+dp ] , our calculated linewidths agree well with the experimental data , except in the low - temperature range for large @xmath21 transitions ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the experimental linewidths for @xmath9 show @xmath140 dependence in the whole examined temperature range.@xcite for @xmath141 , and + 8 , the calculated linewidths are appreciably smaller than the experimental linewidths below 10 k. as a possible explanation for this discrepancy , we speculate that at low temperatures and large @xmath21 , ( i ) our assumption , @xmath142 , may break down , and/or ( ii ) there might be other linewidth contributions that we have neglected , which should be included along with the dipolar and exchange interactions . in principle , when @xmath61 is not much smaller than unity , a first - order calculation in @xmath61 produces corrections of @xmath143 .",
    "but its implementation is quite complicated , and a first - order calculation may anyway not be sufficient to explain fully the measured linewidths . introducing the concept of the crossover temperature to explain the temperature dependence of the widths seems to be successful for @xmath83 ghz .",
    "however , recent epr experiments ( fig . 8 in ref . ) showed that even when the frequency increased to @xmath144 ghz such that the resonant field for the ground state transition ( @xmath145 ) is approximately 1 tesla , the linewidths for this transition still increased with _ decreasing _ temperatures down to 2 k. this can not be explained using the reasoning given above , because the crossover temperature for the transition is approximately 15 k , so that the linewidths should decrease with decreasing temperature below about 15 k. at present , we do not fully understand the broadening of this ground - state transition .",
    "( at @xmath144 ghz , for other transitions than the ground - state transition , the temperature dependence of the linewidths can be understood using the concept of the crossover temperature . )",
    "consideration of exchange interaction in the linewidths slightly reduces @xmath120 ( from 0.0076d to 0.0064d ) and the dipolar interaction ( from @xmath146 gauss@xmath126 to @xmath137 gauss@xmath126 ) . however , the quality of the linewidth fit including exchange interaction is comparable to that without exchange interaction since the exchange coupling constant is very small compared with the linewidths.@xcite the two fitting parameters , @xmath137 gauss@xmath126 , and @xmath138 gauss@xmath126 , can be calculated using the exact geometry of the system .",
    "the calculated values are @xmath147 gauss@xmath126 and @xmath148 gauss@xmath126 , when the easy axis is 9@xmath149 off from the @xmath108 axis toward the positive @xmath109 axis , and 7@xmath149 off from the @xmath150 plane.@xcite the optimum value of @xmath151 is quite close to @xmath152 , in contrast with @xmath87 .",
    "possible reasons that the optimum value of @xmath87 is much smaller than @xmath153 are as follows : ( i ) in our calculation , we considered each molecule to be a point dipole .",
    "if we consider the atomic positions of the eight fe ions in each molecule and calculate the dipolar interaction between fe ions in different molecules , then the sum of the squared dipolar interaction , @xmath87 , can be significantly reduced .",
    "( ii ) recent nmr experiments for the single - molecule magnet mn@xmath1 showed some spin - density leakage onto the ligands.@xcite this indicates indirectly that for fe@xmath0 the spin density in a single molecule may not be confined only on the core , which would thus reduce the magnetic moments of the eight fe ions .",
    "the above two reasons are our speculations to explain the discrepancy , but it is still unclear why considering the atomic structure within each molecule does not substantially change the value of @xmath151 .",
    "the experimental data for mn@xmath1 are limited to resonance frequencies below 190 ghz , so that the large @xmath21 transitions where the line shifts are significant can not be observed for these low - frequency measurements .",
    "additionally , the linewidths for mn@xmath1 are an order of magnitude larger than those for fe@xmath0 . therefore",
    ", relatively small line shifts are probably masked for mn@xmath1 .",
    "thus , hereafter , the small line shifts are ignored in our analysis , so the exchange interaction and the effective dipole field @xmath64 need not be considered in the linewidth analysis for mn@xmath1 .",
    "the sources of the line broadening are then @xmath2-strain , @xmath3-strain , and the dipolar interaction .",
    "line broadening caused by the @xmath2-strain and @xmath3-strain effects for mn@xmath1 is found to have a weak temperature dependence ( not shown ) , which is similar to the line broadening due to the @xmath2-strain effect for fe@xmath0 .",
    "the contribution of the dipolar interaction to the linewidths is shown vs temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp - mn ] . here @xmath154 gauss@xmath126 . the dipolar broadening increases with increasing temperature for @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "we do not see the regime where the dipolar broadening decreases with increasing temperature , because the crossover temperature for @xmath157 , about 32 k ( the resonant field is about 1.6 t ) , is close to the highest temperature analyzed ( 40 k ) . unlike fe@xmath0 , the @xmath21 dependence of the dipolar broadening does not decrease with increasing temperature ( the curves are almost parallel ) .",
    "this is also observed in the experimental data ( shown as symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : d+g+dp ] ) .",
    "we combine the three effects ( @xmath2-strain , @xmath3-strain , and dipolar interactions ) to find that the calculated linewidths agree well with the measured linewidths with @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 gauss@xmath126 , as shown in fig .",

    "the optimum parameter values found here are different from those estimated in ref . , because the examined mn@xmath1 sample was different . the calculated value for @xmath87 , with the exact geometry of mn@xmath1 from ref .",

    "overall , the temperature dependence of the linewidths for mn@xmath1 is weaker than for fe@xmath0 , because the distribution in @xmath2 for mn@xmath1 is roughly three times as wide as for fe@xmath0 , and the dipolar broadening for fe@xmath0 is comparable to that for mn@xmath1 .",

[",
    "fig : exp_shifts ] and [ fig : shifts ] ) provides possible evidence of an exchange interaction between molecules , and it determines the sign and order of magnitude of the exchange interaction . the competition of the suggested exchange interaction with the dipolar interaction would tend to lower a possible magnetic ordering temperature",
