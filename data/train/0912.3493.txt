    "the study of turbulence from a lagrangian viewpoint has a long history , with the earliest works of taylor @xcite and richardson @xcite both pre - dating kolmogorov @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov 1941 theory used the constancy of the globally - averaged dissipation - rate @xmath9 across scales to deduce , among others , the scaling properties of the wavenumber spectrum of kinetic energy .",
    "the 1941 theory was extended to account for intermittency by the introduction of the so - called refined kolmogorov similarity hypothesis ( rksh ) @xcite in 1962 . in this k62 extension of the theory , conditional statistics , based on the dissipation rate averaged in some particular subregion of the flow ,",
    "acquires a central role . the local dissipation rate , usually denoted by @xmath0 ,",
    "is defined according to @xmath10 ^ 2 d^3 { \\bf x } ' ,   \\label{eq : defepsilonr}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the volume of the subregion @xmath12 ( e.g. a box or a sphere ) of size @xmath13 centered at @xmath14 , @xmath1 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath15 is the strain - rate tensor .",
    "one of the main predictions of the rksh relates to the longitudinal velocity increment at scale @xmath13 , defined as @xmath16(r_i / r)$ ] .",
    "the rksh states that in the inertial range of turbulence the statistics of @xmath17 depend on @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , from dimensional analysis , various moments of @xmath17 conditioned upon a fixed value of @xmath0 will scale as @xmath18 , essentially following kolmogorov s 1941 postulate , but locally .",
    "anomalous scaling results from the additional global averaging and anomalous scaling behavior of moments of @xmath0 .",
    "the existing literature to validate rksh has focused mainly on velocity increments @xcite or acceleration @xcite in which the analysis can be performed on single snapshot measurements of the turbulent flow , i.e. based on a relatively ` static ' point of view of the flow .    in order to examine the rksh in more depth , one would also like to inquire about its dynamical origin , specifically its role in the time evolution of the local structure of turbulence .",
    "it is well recognized that the dynamics of turbulence is best understood in a lagrangian frame of reference , i.e. following fluid particles .",
    "recent years have witnessed a strong revival of interest in lagrangian statistics in turbulence . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of turbulence following fluid particles also plays a central role in the pdf modeling framework developed over the past two decades by s. pope , starting with his seminal 1985 paper @xcite .",
    "besides which ` frame ' to use in the description of the dynamics , it is also important to select variables of interest that convey rich information about the flow . in recent years , there has been growing attention placed in the dynamical evolution of the velocity gradient tensor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath19 provides rich information about the topological and statistical properties of small - scale structure in turbulence .",
    "pioneering studies of the lagrangian structure and stochastic modeling of @xmath19 are described in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian time evolution of @xmath19 can be obtained by taking gradient of the ns equation @xcite : @xmath21 as usual , @xmath22 stands for lagrangian material derivative , @xmath23 is the pressure divided by the density of the fluid , and the second and third terms on the right - hand - side of this equation are the pressure hessian tensor and viscous term respectively . neglecting viscous effects and assuming the pressure hessian isotropic lead to a closed formulation known as the restricted - euler ( re ) dynamics @xcite , @xcite . with analytically treatable solutions for the full tensor - level",
    ", the re system provides a fruitful starting point for small structure modeling although there exist serious deficiencies in the re dynamics , especially since it predicts nonphysical finite - time singularities @xcite .",
    "models have been developed to mimic the regularization features of the neglected pressure hessian and viscous terms .",
    "efforts include a stochastic model in which the nonlinear term is modified to yield log - normal statistics of the dissipation @xcite , a linear damping model for viscous term @xcite , a tetrad model @xcite for pressure hessian closure , a viscous diffusion closure @xcite , a new stochastic dynamic model , so - called recent fluid deformation closure , for both viscous and pressure hessian terms @xcite , and a multi - scale model which includes energy exchange between scales @xcite .",
    "the study of the temporal auto - correlation structure of various quantities associated with @xmath19 assists in the further developments and improvements of such models .",
    "it has recently been confirmed @xcite that when averaging over the entire domain , auto - correlation functions of velocity gradient tensor elements decay on timescales on the order of the mean kolmogorov turnover time scale .",
    "this time scale is computed from the globally averaged rate of dissipation and viscosity . however , when performing the analysis in different subregions of the flow , turbulence intermittency was found to lead to large spatial variability in the decay time scales .",
    "remarkably , excellent collapse of the auto - correlation functions is recovered when using the ` local kolmogorov time - scale ' defined using the locally , rather than the globally , averaged dissipation - rate ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is an additional new evidence for the validity of kolmogorov s refined similarity hypothesis , but from a lagrangian viewpoint that provides a natural frame to describe the dynamical time evolution of turbulence .    in this paper , we study lagrangian time - correlations of scalar measures ( such as magnitudes ) of velocity and pressure gradients and explore whether there is further evidence for the lagrangian rksh for these variables .",
    "lagrangian correlation functions of square strain- and rotation - rate have already been studied in prior work @xcite . in examining the scaling of the magnitudes of the velocity gradient tensor and pressure gradient ,",
    "the behavior of correlation functions will be shown here to be much more complex than for the tensor or vector elements themselves .",
    "nontrivial dependencies on local - length scale @xmath13 and local dissipation - rate ( @xmath0 ) are observed , and these require more detailed study .",
    "the present paper is devoted to such a study , based on analysis of lagrangian data .",
    "lagrangian data can be extracted from direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of ns equations with relative ease .",
    "the first such effort traces back to riley and patterson @xcite .",
    "the rapid development in computing power over the past few decades has spurred vast amount of such numerical investigations at increasing reynolds numbers .",
    "for relevant reviews , see @xcite and references therein . a new way to exploit large databases in turbulence has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on web - services that allow public access to turbulence dns databases that store not only snapshots of 3d distributions but also the entire pre - computed time history . using this public turbulence database , here we study the lagrangian time evolution of velocity and pressure gradients and their magnitudes in isotropic turbulence .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : database ] describes the public turbulence database and the numerical approach we use to perform the lagrangian analysis .",
    "results on the time evolution of auto - correlations of velocity and pressure gradient magnitudes are presented in section [ sec : correlations ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : concl ] with a short discussion .",
    "the dns data of a forced isotropic turbulence archived in the jhu public database system are from a pseudo - spectral parallel computation of the forced ns equations in a @xmath25 ^ 3 $ ] domain , at a taylor - microscale reynolds number of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the database contains of output on @xmath27 spatial points and 1024 time samples ( every tenth dns time - step is stored ) spanning about one large - scale eddy turnover time .",
    "the domain - wide averaged dissipation - rate ( @xmath28 ) and the corresponding kolmogorov time scale ( @xmath29 ) are 0.092 and 0.045 respectively , in the units of the simulation .",
    "the turbulence integral scale is @xmath30 .",
    "some data processing functionalities such as spatial differentiation , and spatial and temporal interpolations are provided directly inside the database .",
    "this feature not only reduces data download cost but also allows users to obtain desired quantities at arbitrary locations and times .",
    "the whole database results in a 27 terabyte storage size . the @xmath3 space+time history of turbulence is publicly accessible through a web - service interface which serves as a bridge to connect user requests with the database nodes .",
    "users may write and execute analysis programs using prevailing languages c , fortran , or matlab on their host computers such as desktops or laptops , while the programs request desired outputs from the database through getfunctions ( subroutine - like calls ) over the internet . currently , eight getfunctions listed in table [ ta : getfunctions ] for velocity and pressure along with their derivatives and force are available . with these call functions , users can retrieve quantities simultaneously for large amounts of locations and time ( within the stored time frames ) without expensive memory and time costs .",

    "<S> the data used in this study are sampled from the web - services accessible public turbulence database ( ` http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu ` ) . </S>",
    "<S> the database archives a @xmath3 ( space+time ) pseudo - spectral direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence with taylor - scale reynolds number @xmath4 , and supports spatial differentiation and spatial / temporal interpolation inside the database . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that the temporal evolution of the auto - correlations of the absolute values are determined not by the local kolmogorov time - scale but by the local eddy - turnover time scale defined as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , considerable scatter remains and appears to be reduced only after a further ( intermittency ) correction factor of the form of @xmath6 is introduced where @xmath7 is the turbulence integral scale . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath8 varies for different variables . </S>",
    "<S> the collapse of the correlation functions for absolute values is , however , less satisfactory than the collapse observed for the more rapidly decaying strain - rate tensor element correlation functions . </S>"
