    "an expedient characterisation and classification of quantum measurements is central to quantum control tasks @xcite , especially when the optimisation of certain figures of merit is involved @xcite . in the context of the coherent control of quantum continuous variables ,",

    "such conditional dynamics share the property of preserving the gaussian nature of the system s state , and thus allow for an extensive analytical treatment .",
    "let us remind the reader that general - dyne measurements include the well known homodyne and heterodyne detection schemes as special cases . in this paper , we consider a system of one degree of freedom coupled with a thermal reservoir at non - zero temperature , and derive the unravelling of the master equation enacted by general - dyne detection on the environmental degree of freedom coupled to the system .",
    "further , we identify a feasible measurement scheme to perform general - dyne detection , and relate it explicitly to the parameter that specifies the general - dyne unravelling of the master equation .    note",
    "that our treatment holds at finite , non - zero temperature , which is particularly relevant to mechanical systems where the optical master equation still applies .",
    "the cooling and coherent control of such systems is now very much in the limelight of research in experimental opto - mechanics and quantum optics @xcite .",
