    "a relativistic modified gravity ( mog ) theory  @xcite has been proposed to explain the rotational velocity curves of galaxies and the x - ray data for clusters of galaxies with a modified newtonian acceleration law , without non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "a fitting routine for galaxy rotation curves has been used to fit a large number of galaxy rotational velocity curve data , including low surface brightness ( lsb ) , high surface brightness ( hsb ) , dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies with both photometric data and a two - parameter core model without non - baryonic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the fits to the data are remarkably good and for the photometric data only the one parameter , the mass - to - light ratio @xmath4 , is used for the fitting , once two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are universally fixed for galaxies and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the fitting results for galaxies are consistent with the data for the tully - fisher relation  @xcite .",
    "a large sample of x - ray mass profile cluster data has also been fitted  @xcite .",
    "the gravity theory also fits the anomalous acceleration data observed during the pioneer 10 - 11 spacecraft missions  @xcite , and is consistent with gravity observations in the solar system and the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 .",
    "the mog requires that newton s constant g , the coupling constant @xmath7 that measures the strength of the coupling of a skew field to matter and the mass @xmath8 of the skew field , vary with distance and time , so that agreement with the solar system and the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 data can be achieved , as well as fits to galaxy rotation curve data and galaxy cluster data .",
    "the variation of @xmath9 leads to a consistent description of relativistic lensing effects for galaxies without non - baryonic dark matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the variation of these constants was based on a renormalization group ( rg ) flow description of quantum gravity theory formulated in terms of an effective classical action .",
    "large infrared renormalization effects can cause the effective @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the cosmological constant @xmath10 to run with momentum @xmath11 and a cutoff procedure leads to a space and time varying @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath12 and @xmath6 is the effective range of the skew symmetric field . in the mog theory  @xcite",
    ", the action contains a contribution that leads to _ effective _ field equations that describe the variations of @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in principle",
    ", we can solve for the complete set of field equations and determine the dynamical behavior of all the fields .",
    "however , in practice we make approximations allowing us to obtain partial solutions to the equations , yielding predictions for the various physical systems considered .    a modified gravity theory must be able to explain the following cosmological data and phenomena :    1 .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , including the power spectrum for both large and small angular scales on the sky ; 2 .   the formation of galaxies before and after recombination ; 3 .   gravitational lensing ; 4 .   n - body simulations of large - scale galaxy surveys ; 5 .   the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the standard explanation for these phenomena is the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario and some form of uniform dark energy that begins to dominate in the present epoch of the universe .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that 96% of the universe s matter and energy budget is invisible .",
    "it remains undetected in ground - based laboratory experiments , and has yet to be given a satisfactory physical interpretation  @xcite .",
    "an attempt to explain the cmb power spectrum at the surface of last scattering about 370,000 years after the big bang in terms of the visible baryon number density  @xcite , leads to a satisfactory fit to the wmap and archeops data  @xcite for the first two peaks in the power spectrum at small angles with the baryon density fraction @xmath2 and the cosmological constant density fraction @xmath13 .",
    "this scenario requires a neutrino mass contribution with @xmath14 ev .",
    "the baryon density parameter @xmath2 is in agreement with recent estimates for this quantity at big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the problem with this pure baryon - neutrino scenario is that a third putative peak in the angular power spectrum is erased by baryon drag .",
    "a problem with neutrinos describing dark matter is that they become non - relativistic at a late - time epoch in the expanding universe , and their fluctuations are erased in the power spectrum .",
    "the most recent balloon - born boomerang data  @xcite indicate the existence of a third peak in the power spectrum , which is erased by baryon drag without cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "if future data confirms that a significant third peak in the angular power spectrum exists , then this strongly supports that some form of dark , non - baryonic matter should exist at the surface of last scattering .",
    "all of this suggests that some kind of non - relativistic dark matter should be accounted for in cosmology . on the other hand",
    ", the mog fits to the galaxy rotation curve data and the x - ray galaxy cluster data  @xcite without non - baryonic dark matter are remarkably good and avoid problematic issues related to cdm fits to the galaxy data .",
    "it is also necessary to provide a satisfactory explanation for the early universe growth of structure and the eventual emergence of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "large computer n - body simulations show that some kind of non - relativistic dark matter has to constitute the proto - galaxies about 200 million years after the big bang  @xcite .",
    "the data suggest that early universe density fluctuations were a gaussian random field described by a cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the standard assumption is that the cdm is made of elementary particles that interact only gravitationally .",
    "baryons and neutrinos alone fail to produce a realistic description of large - scale galaxies and clusters surveys .",
    "an important extra - degree of freedom in mog is a light , electrically uncharged vector particle called a `` phion '' . in the early universe at a temperature @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a critical temperature ,",
    "the phions become a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) fluid .",
    "the phion condensates couple weakly with gravitational strength to ordinary baryonic matter .",
    "this cold fluid of phion condensates dominates the density of matter at cosmological scales and , because of its clumping due to gravitational collapse , allows the formation of structure and galaxies at sub - horizon scales well before recombination .",
    "we do not postulate the existence of cold dark matter in the form of heavy , _ new stable particles _ such as supersymmetric wimps .    in the following",

    "the approximate analytical formula yields results for the small angular scale acoustical oscillations that agree with reasonable accuracy with the wmap , archeops and boomerang data  @xcite .",
    "since the phion condensates do not couple to radiation and only couple with weak gravitational strength to baryons , their density perturbations are not subject to dissipation like photon and neutrino density perturbations before recombination .",
    "for large - scale cosmology , the phion condensate density on the average dominates the matter density , while for _ locally bound galactic systems and clusters of galaxies _ visible baryon density dominates the matter density , and the mog field equations and the quantum bec equations lead to an effective modification of the newtonian acceleration law for weak fields that yields an excellent fit to the galaxy rotation curve data and the x - ray cluster mass profile data  @xcite .",

    "a calculation of the classical limit of the non - linear gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function leads to an effective , classical modified newtonian acceleration law .",
    "the rotational velocity curves of spiral galaxies are flattened , because of the altered dynamics of the gravitational field at the outer regions of the galaxies and not because of the presence of a dominant dark matter halo .",
    "the neutral phion bec fluid dominates the cosmological density at large cosmological scales , and the phion condensate in cosmology has taken on the role of a light , cold `` dark matter '' fluid .",
    "this allows for a fitting of the acoustical fluctuation spectrum at small angular scales . according to our mog scenario",
    ", we do not expect in the present universe to detect heavy wimps such as the supersymmetric neutralinos in accelerators or in underground experiments .",
    "the dual role played by the phion particle in describing galaxies and the large - scale structure of the universe is a generic feature of our mog theory .",
    "we have succeeded in fitting in a unified picture a large amount of data over 16 orders of magnitude in distance scale from earth to the surface of last scattering some 13.7 billion years ago , using our modified gravitational theory .",
    "the data fitting ranges over four distance scales : the solar system , galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the cmb power spectrum data at the surface of last scattering .",
