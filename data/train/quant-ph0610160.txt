    "nonclassical properties of the radiation field play a relevant role in modern information processing since , in general , improve continuous variable ( cv ) communication protocols based on light manipulation @xcite . indeed , _",
    "quantum light _ finds application in several fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , as well as in high precision measurements and high capacity communication channels @xcite . among nonclassical features",
    ", entanglement plays a major role , being the essential resource for quantum computing , teleportation , and cryptographic protocols .",
    "recently , cv entanglement has been proved as a valuable tool also for improving optical resolution , spectroscopy , interferometry , tomography , and discrimination of quantum operations .",
    "recent experimental realizations also include dense coding @xcite and teleportation network @xcite .",
    "entanglement in optical systems is usually generated through parametric downconversion in nonlinear crystals .",
    "the resulting bipartite state , the so - called twin - beam state of radiation ( twb ) , allows the realization of several beautiful experiments and the demonstration of the above quantum protocols .",
    "however , the resources available to generate cv entangled states are unavoidably limited : nonlinearities are generally small , and , in turn , the resulting states have a limited amount of entanglement and energy . in this context ,",
    "practical applications require novel schemes to create more entangled states or to increase the degree of entanglement of a given signal .    in quantum mechanics",
    ", the reduction postulate provides an alternative mechanism to achieve _ effective _ nonlinear dynamics .",
    "in fact , if a measurement is performed on a portion of a composite system the output state strongly depends on the results of the measurement . as a consequence , the _ conditional _ state of the unmeasured part , _",
    "i.e. _ the sub - ensemble corresponding to a given outcome , may be connected to the initial one by a ( strongly ) nonlinear map . in this paper , we focus our attention on a scheme of this kind , and address a conditional method based on subtraction of photons to enhance nonclassical features . in particular , we analyze how , and to which extent , photon subtraction may be used to increase nonlocal correlations of twin - beams . as we will see , photon subtraction transforms the gaussian wigner function of twb into non - gaussian one , and therefore it is also referred to as a _ de - gaussification _ process .",
    "the photon subtraction process on twbs was first proposed in @xcite , where a well defined number of photons is being subtracted from both the parties of a twb , by transmitting each mode through beam splitter and performing a joint photon - number measurement on the reflected beams .",
    "the degree of entanglement is then increased and the the fidelity of the cv teleportation assisted by such photon subtracted state is improved @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme is based on the possibility of resolving the actual number of revealed photons . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the improvement of teleportation fidelity is possible also when the number of detected photon is not known . in our scheme",
    "we use on / off avalanche photodetectors able only to distinguish the presence from the absence of radiation . for this reason we referred to this method as to inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) .",
    "the single - mode version of this process has been recently implemented @xcite and the nonclassicality of the generated state starting from squeezed vacuum has been theoretically investigated @xcite .",
    "in addition , nonlocal properties of the photon - subtracted twbs have been investigated by means of different nonlocality tests @xcite , finding enhanced nonlocal properties depending on the particular test and on the choice of the involved parameters .",
    "this paper is devoted to review the effects of ips process on twbs either in the ideal case , i.e. , when the detection are not affected by losses and no dissipation or thermal noise occurs during the propagation of the involved modes , or when non unit quantum efficiency is taken into account as well as the dynamics through a noisy channel is considered .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we introduce photon subtraction as a method to enhance nonclassicality of a radiation state and illustrate inconclusive photon subtraction on a single - mode field .",
    "the de - gaussification process on two - mode fields is described in sec .  [",

    "[ s : dp ] ) , the homodyne detection test ( sec .  [ s : hd ] ) , the pseudospin test ( sec .  [ s : ps ] ) , and a nonlocality test based on on / off photodetection ( sec .  [ s : on : off ] ) . finally , sec .",
    "[ s : remarks ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the idea of enhancing nonclassical properties of radiation by subtraction of photons has been introduced in the context of schrdinger cat generation @xcite and subsequently applied to the improvement of cv teleportation fidelity @xcite . in the schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite the field - mode to be `` photon subtracted '' ( ps ) is impinged onto a beam - splitter with high transmissivity and whose second port is left unexcited . at the output of the beam splitter the reflected mode undergoes photon number measurement whereas the conditional state of the transmitted mode represents the ps state . the properties of the ps state depend on the number of detected photons , with single - photon subtracted states that play a major role in the enhancement of nonclassicality .",
    "unfortunately , the realization of photon number resolving detectors is still experimentally challenging , and therefore a question arises concerning the experimental feasibility of subtraction schemes .",
    "photodetectors that are usually available in quantum optics such as avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) operates in the geiger mode @xcite .",
    "they can be used to reconstruct the photon statistics @xcite but can not be used as photon counters .",
    "apds show high quantum efficiency but their breakdown current is independent of the number of detected photons , which in turn can not be determined .",
    "the outcome of these apd s is either `` off '' ( no photons detected ) or `` on '' , i.e. , a `` click '' , indicating the detection of one or more photons .",
    "actually , such an outcome can be provided by any photodetector ( photomultiplier , hybrid photodetector , cryogenic thermal detector ) for which the charge contained in dark pulses is definitely below that of the output current pulses corresponding to the detection of at least one photon .",
    "note that for most high - gain photmultipliers the anodic pulses corresponding to no photons detected can be easily discriminated by a threshold from those corresponding to the detection of one or more photons .",
    "it appears therefore of interest to investigate the properties of photon subtracted states when the number of detected photons is not discriminated .",

    "we have analyzed in details a photon subtraction scheme to de - gaussify states of radiation and , in particular , to enhance nonlocal properties of twin - beams .",

    "the ips process can be implemented with current technology and , indeed , application to single - mode state has been recently realized with high conditional probability @xcite .",
    "we found that ips process improves fidelity of coherent state teleportation and show , by using several different nonlocality tests , that it also enhances nonlocal correlations .",
    "ips may be profitably used also on nonmaximmally mixed entangled states , as the ones coming from the evolution of twb in a noisy channel . in addition , the effectiveness of the process is not dramatically influenced either by the transmissivity of the beam - splitter used to subtract photons , not by the quantum efficiency of the detectors used to reveal them .",
