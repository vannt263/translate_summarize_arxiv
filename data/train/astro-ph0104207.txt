    "the ultraviolet and optical continuum and the broad emission line flux of seyfert1 galaxies are known to be variable on timescales of a few days until years .",
    "variations on timescales of hours and even less have been observed in x - rays ( e.g.barr & mushotzky @xcite ; leighly et al.@xcite ; george et al.@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "+ to study the physical processes which are responsible for the observed spectral energy distribution of an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) multiwavelength monitoring campaigns have proven to be an excellent tool ( cf.peterson @xcite ; netzer & peterson @xcite for a review ; marshall et al.@xcite ; nandra et al.@xcite ; edelson et al.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , over the last decade , several large space - based and ground - based monitoring programs have been undertaken for nearby agn , such as ngc5548 ( clavel et al.@xcite ; peterson et al.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; maoz et al.@xcite ; dietrich et al.@xcite ; korista et al.@xcite ; chiang et al.@xcite ) , ngc3783 ( reichert et al.@xcite ; stirpe et al.@xcite ; alloin et al.@xcite ) , ngc4151 ( crenshaw et al.@xcite ; kaspi et al.@xcite ; warwick et al.@xcite ; edelson et al.@xcite ) , fairall9 ( rodrguez - pascual et al.@xcite ; santos - lle et al.@xcite ) , 3c390.3 ( leighly et al.@xcite ; dietrich et al.@xcite ; obrien et al.@xcite ) , and ngc7469 ( wanders et al.@xcite ; collier et al.@xcite ) .",
    "a broad - line region ( blr ) size of the order of less than a few light weeks is indicated for seyfert1 galaxies by the correlated variations of the broad emission - line flux and of the optical / ultraviolet continuum .",
    "it is generally assumed that the central supermassive black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "such an accretion disk is the probable origin of a significant fraction of the broad emission - line flux ( e.g.laor & netzer @xcite ; dumont & collin - souffrin @xcite ; halpern @xcite ; zheng , veilleux , & grandi @xcite ; hubeny et al.@xcite ) .",
    "recently , kaspi et al.(@xcite ) published results of a long term monitoring campaign of quasars . including the results of seyfert1 galaxies ( wandel et al.@xcite ) they suggested a relation between the blr size and the optical luminosity given by r@xmath8l@xmath15 .",
    "the seyfert1 galaxy ngc5548 has been continuously monitored in the optical since late 1988 by the international agn watch consortium ( peterson et al.@xcite ; cf .",
    "alloin ( @xcite ) for an agn watch overview ) . in june 1998",
    "this prominent seyfert1 galaxy was targeted for a coordinated intense monitoring campaign using euve , asca , and rxte to study the high energy continuum emission and its temporal characteristics ( chiang et al.@xcite ) .",
    "chiang et al.s observations indicate that the variations at @xmath80.2kev ( euv ) appear to lead similar variations at energies larger than @xmath81kev by 38 hrs .",
    "this was unexpected as it was generally assumed that correlated variations of the euv , uv , and optical emission would all be due to reprocessed higher energy radiation .",
    "+ since this campaign provided the rare opportunity to access the high energy continuum variations with especially high temporal sampling , we organized a simultaneous ground - based campaign for the optical wavelength domain .    assuming part of the blr flux",
    "is emitted from the accretion disk , variations on timescales of one day or even less should be detected ( stella @xcite ) . for this model of a relativistic keplerian disk",
    "it was shown that weak narrow features should drift across the emission line profile .",
    "these weak structures are expected to start at high velocities i.e. in the outer profile wings , and move towards the line center to be due to the longer time delay at larger radii of the disk in response to the variable continuum emission .",
    "the timescale of the shift depends on the mass of the central black hole and it is for ngc5548 of the order of less than several days ( cf.stella @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of such structures would be a strong indication for the presence of an accretion disk in the innermost region of an agn .",
    "generally , current monitoring campaigns have not provided the necessary temporal and spectral resolution for detecting such substructures in the broad emission line profiles .",
    "however short term monitoring campaigns had been undertaken for ngc4151 ( xanthopoulos & derobertis @xcite ; crenshaw et al.@xcite ; kaspi et al.@xcite ; warwick et al.@xcite ; edelson et al.@xcite ) and for a small sample of agn ( e.g.ngc5548 , ngc4151 , 3c390.3 , arp102b , mkn6 ; eracleous & halpern @xcite ) . as yet no significant short timescale broad emission line flux variation or profile variability has been detected .    in this paper , we present the results of the optical photometric and spectroscopic observations that were obtained in june 1998 simultaneous with the high energy campaign ( chiang et al.@xcite ) . in section 2",
    "we describe the optical observations and outline intercalibration procedures by which a homogeneous set of photometric and spectroscopic measurements can be achieved . in section 3",
    "we present measurements of the broad - band flux as well as of the broad balmer emission - line flux .",
    "we compare our results with the results of the simultaneous campaign of the euv wavelength range ( chiang et al.@xcite ) .",

    "the flux calibration of agn spectra can be accomplished in several ways . in variability studies ,",
    "it has become common practice to normalize the flux scale to the fluxes of strong forbidden narrow emission lines which are assumed to be constant over timescales of at least several decades ( e.g.peterson @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption is justified by the large spatial extent and low gas density of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , but is only valid if the aperture used is larger than the nlr .",
    "light travel - time effects and the long recombination timescale ( @xmath31years for @xmath32@xmath33 ) damp out short timescale variability .    as a major sources of uncertainty in inhomogenous samples of variability data is the use of different instrumental settings , it is important to take aperture effects into account ( peterson & collins @xcite ) . the seeing - dependent uncertainties which are introduced by the aperture geometry can be minimized by using large apertures .",
    "it has been shown that apertures of 5  @xmath34 75 can reduce seeing - dependent photometric errors to no more than a few percent in the case of nearby agns ( peterson et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of ngc5548 obtained at the 1 m telescope of sao ras ( sample l1 table 1 ) were extracted for a slit aperture of 80 @xmath34 66 and 80 @xmath34 198 , respectively . for these large apertures seeing losses",
    "can be neglected . to measure the f([oiii ]",
    "5007 ) a linear pseudo - continuum was fitted beneath the [ oiii ] emission line and the flux was measured for the wavelength range @xmath355062 - 5108  . for the extraction windows used for sample l1 we determined a flux of f([oiii ] 5007 ) = ( 5.07@xmath220.05 ) 10@xmath36ergs@xmath13@xmath29 ( 80 @xmath34 66 ) and f([oiii ] 5007 ) = ( 5.91@xmath220.05 ) 10@xmath36ergs@xmath13@xmath29 ( 80 @xmath34 198 ) , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with f([oiii ] 5007 ) measured for ngc5548 during the last 10 years ( cf.peterson et al.@xcite ) . for large apertures of comparable size ( e.g. 88 @xmath34 128 ) f([oiii ] 5007 ) = 5.1 to 5.9 10@xmath36ergs@xmath13@xmath29 is mentioned ( peterson et al.@xcite ) .",

    "since the spectra of the various samples were taken with different instruments in different configurations , it was necessary to intercalibrate them to a common flux level . as we have shown above , the [ oiii]5007 line flux was constant to better than 1%  for large extraction windows .",
    "we can safely use the narrow emission lines such as the flux of [ oiii]5007 as standards . in order to avoid any wavelength - dependent calibration errors ,",

    "however , it seems that onset and disappearance of microvariability follow a random process since several attempts to detect or to confirm rapid optical variations of seyfert1 galaxies failed ( cf.dultzin-hacyan et al.@xcite ; petrucci et al.@xcite ) .",
    "hence , it might be that rapid variations can not be detected on timescales larger than 15 minutes .",

    "<S> the broad band fluxes and the optical continuum @xmath3(5100 ) appear to vary simultaneously with the euv variations . </S>",
    "<S> no reliable delay was detected for the broad optical emission lines in response to the euve variations . </S>",
    "<S> narrow h@xmath7 emission features predicted as a signature of an accretion disk were not detected during this campaign . </S>",
