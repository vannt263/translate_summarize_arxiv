    "the notion of mesh patterns was introduced by brndn and claesson @xcite to provide explicit expansions for certain permutation statistics as , possibly infinite , linear combinations of ( classical ) permutation patterns .",
    "this notion was further studied in @xcite .",
    "kitaev and remmel @xcite initiated the systematic study of distribution of quadrant marked mesh patterns on permutations .",
    "the study was extended to 132-avoiding permutations by kitaev , remmel and tiefenbruck in @xcite , and the present paper continues this line of research .",

    "then we will consider the graph of @xmath4 , @xmath11 , to be the set of points @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the graph of the permutation @xmath14 is pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] . then if we draw a coordinate system centered at a point @xmath12 , we will be interested in the points that lie in the four quadrants i , ii , iii , and iv of that coordinate system as pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] . for any @xmath15 and any @xmath16 , the set of all permutations of length @xmath17",
    ", we say that @xmath2 matches the quadrant marked mesh pattern @xmath18 in @xmath4 if , in @xmath11 relative to the coordinate system which has the point @xmath12 as its origin , there are at least @xmath5 points in quadrant i , at least @xmath6 points in quadrant ii , at least @xmath7 points in quadrant iii , and at least @xmath8 points in quadrant iv . for example , if @xmath14 , the point @xmath19 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath20 since in @xmath11 relative to the coordinate system with the origin at @xmath21 , there are 3 points in quadrant i , 1 point in quadrant ii , 2 points in quadrant iii , and 2 points in quadrant iv . note that if a coordinate in @xmath18 is 0 , then there is no condition imposed on the points in the corresponding quadrant .",
    "in addition , we shall consider patterns @xmath18 where @xmath22 . here when a coordinate of @xmath18 is the empty set , then for @xmath2 to match @xmath18 in @xmath16 , it must be the case that there are no points in @xmath11 relative to the coordinate system with the origin at @xmath12 in the corresponding quadrant .",
