    "the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0  exhibits a rich spectrum of strongly correlated electron behavior .",
    "this unconventional d - wave superconductor exhibits non - fermi liquid behavior associated with proximity to a proposed quantum critical point , as well as a new thermodynamic phase ( b phase ) that exists only within the superconducting phase near @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "initially this b phase was identified as the elusive fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superconducting phase first predicted to exist in pauli - limited superconductors over 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "however , recent nmr work identified the presence of incommensurate antiferromagnetic order in the b phase in contrast to the standard predictions for the fflo phase @xcite .",
    "signatures of magnetism were also seen in other nmr experiments @xcite . despite initial arguments to the contrary @xcite , recent neutron scattering results by kenzelmann and",
    "coworkers now provide conclusive proof for long - range static incommensurate antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "the original nmr work measured the spectrum of the in(2 ) sites and proposed a candidate magnetic structure in which both the ordered ce moments and the incommensurate wavevector are parallel to the applied field ( along [ 100 ] ) .",
    "however , the neutron scattering experiments found that when the field was applied along [ @xmath2 the moments lie along [ 001 ] and the incommensuration along [ 110 ] .",
    "recently we have re - analyzed the nmr data and shown that by allowing for _ anisotropic _ hyperfine coupling between the ce spins and the @xmath3 in  nuclei , rather than simple isotropic coupling as originally assumed in @xcite , then the nmr spectra are fully consistent with moments along [ 001 ] @xcite . here , we show that by using hyperfine parameters consistent with experimental measurements of the knight shift , we find quantitative agreement for the @xmath3 in  nmr spectra and put constraints on the incommensuration wavevector .",

    "the ordered moments create a static field at the @xmath3 in  and @xmath11conuclear sites through the hyperfine coupling .",
    "this field cancels by symmetry at the in(1 ) and co sites , but the nmr spectra show a large hyperfine field at the in(2a ) site that is aligned either parallel or antiparallel to the applied field ( along [ 100 ] ) . the hyperfine coupling to the in(2a ) site is given by @xmath12 , where the sum is over the two nearest neighbor ce spins ( along [ 100 ] ) .",
    "the coupling tensor is given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 the constants @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be determined by fits to the knight shift and are given by : @xmath18 koe/@xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . in the b phase ,",

    "spectra were determined by calculating the histogram of frequencies , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : hypfieldmap ] , the hyperfine field at the in(2a ) site has components either parallel or antiparallel to the applied field leading to the broad double - peak spectra seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "however , the size of the ordered moment measured by neutrons , @xmath10 implies a hyperfine field larger than observed by nmr .",
    "the nmr data are more consistent with an ordered moment of 0.07@xmath19 . using eq .",
    "[ eqn : hypfield ] and the measured value of the modulus of the hyperfine field of 1.3 koe , we find that the ordered moment and incommensuration are related by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](f ) ) .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a ) - [ fig : spectra](e ) , the measured spectra is relatively insensitive to the direction of the incommensurate wavevector @xmath31 .",
    "subtle changes in the calculated spectra arise because of the component of @xmath32 along [ 001 ] gives rise to small frequency shifts .",
    "the difference between the magnitude of the ordered moment measured by neutrons versus that measured by nmr may be due to either ( i ) changes in the magnetic structure as a function of the orientation of the field , ( ii ) errors associated with the measured values of the hyperfine coupling , ( iii ) dynamic fluctuations of the magnetic structure , or ( iv ) neglect of coupling to conduction electrons .",
    "there are two types of hyperfine couplings in heavy - fermion compounds , one to the conduction electron spins , @xmath33 , and another to the local moments , @xmath34 @xcite . here",
    ", we ignored the coupling to @xmath33 , since the static hyperfine field presumably arises from the ordered ce moments in the b phase . including a hyperfine coupling to the @xmath33 spins may account for the difference in the ordered moments and the incommensuration indicative of a fermi surface instability .",
    "in the original measurements of the in(2a ) nmr , the broad spectrum only emerged below @xmath35 mk ( at 11.1 t where @xmath36 mk and @xmath37 mk , where @xmath38 is the transition temperature to the b phase ) . above @xmath35",
    "mk the in(2a ) spectrum disappeared .",
    "the reason for this behavior is likely due to dynamic effects , in which the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath39 is excessively fast due to the dynamics of the magnetic structure . for sufficiently low temperatures where the magnetic structure becomes static and",
    "@xmath39 is small enough the broad spectrum emerges .",
    "however , when the time scale of the fluctuations is of the inverse of the linewidth ( @xmath40 khz in this case ) the splitting of the nmr spectrum can be less than the full static linewidth .",
    "it is possible that for temperatures @xmath41 mk , the nmr linewidth would broaden to reflect a larger ordered moment .",
    "an outstanding question regarding the nature of the b phase is the possible modulation of the superconducting order parameter @xmath42 . using ginzburg - landau theory , kenzelmann et al",
    ".   proposed a specific coupling between @xmath42 , the antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath43 , and the magnetic field @xmath44 to account for the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "they postulated that at large fields an induced subdominant order parameter nucleates with finite momentum , @xmath45 , in addition to the dominant , uniform @xmath46-wave order parameter @xmath47 . in real space",
    ", this scenario suggests that the superconductivity and antiferromagnetism are out of phase , such that the extrema of magnetization @xmath43 are located at the nodes of @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 should vary at atomic length scales , which is physically unreasonable considering the stiffness of the condensate , @xmath48 .",
    "the nmr spectra of the in(1 ) site , where the hyperfine field cancels , show no broadening that would be associated with a spatial variation of the knight shift @xmath49 due to real - space nodes @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 is proportional to the spin susceptibility , which vanishes for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath42 varied spatially and vanished at real - space nodes , then @xmath49 would vary as well leading to a variation of the resonance frequency and a broad resonance @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is that @xmath42 retains a large uniform component , but has an induced component with modulation @xmath51 : @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "our data suggest that @xmath47 is large and discontinuous across the first order normal - to - superconducting transition at @xmath54 mk at 11.1 t. the narrow linewidth of the in(1 ) ( @xmath55 khz at 100 mk ) suggests that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the spatial modulation of the knight shift due to @xmath58 .",
    "the absence of any knight shift modulation at the in(1 ) preclude any real - space nodes in the order parameter @xmath42 and are at odds with an exchange - split fermi surface resulting in an fflo state .",
    "the nmr data suggest that the b phase of cecoin@xmath0  consists of incommensurate antiferromagnetism coexisting with d - wave superconductivity in the vortex state .",
    "this material exhibits a large fermi surface consistent with fully hybridized f electrons @xcite , thus the presence of ordered local moments with magnitude 0.07@xmath19 in the superconducting state remains unclear .",
    "possible explanations include modulated hybridization @xcite or a two - component scenario @xcite .",
    "the emergence of intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity in pristine undoped materials under these conditions represents a fascinating consequence of proximity to a first - order quantum critical phase transition , which may or may not be universal @xcite .",
