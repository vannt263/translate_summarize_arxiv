    "the demixing transition in mixtures of hard convex three - dimensional particles have received a considerably attention from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "this is due to the possibility of formulating relatively simple theoretical models for mixtures of anisotropic particles which are not allowed to overlap .",
    "these models are based on the simple onsager second - virial approximation @xcite or its rescaled version , the parsons approach @xcite .",
    "also , the scaled particle theory ( spt ) , proposed firstly for hard spheres @xcite and later extended to other particles geometries @xcite , has been a fruitful theoretical tool in the study of these kind of mixtures .",
    "all these models predict that a binary mixture of asymmetric enough particles can demix into two different phases , each one rich in different species .",
    "the nature of uniform demixed phases can be isotropic ( i ) , a fluid with randomly oriented particle axis , or nematic ( n ) in which the particles axes are oriented in average along the nematic director .",
    "all possible demixing transitions , i.e. i - i , n - n and i - n were found from the numerical implementation of these models .    in two dimensions",
    "the theoretical works devoted to the study of the demixing transitions are more scarce , because strictly two - dimensional fluids occur less often in nature compared to the three - dimensional fluids .",
    "examples of the former constitute the quasi - two - dimensional films obtained from preferential chemical adsorption of certain species at interfaces .",
    "the adsorption of polystyrene spheres @xcite or ellipsoidal latex particles @xcite into a two - dimensional interface has allowed the experimental study of freezing and percolation / jamming transitions in two dimensions respectively .",
    "also , the time - dependent behavior of anisotropic colloids near interfaces was recently studied through a theoretical modelling of the langevin dynamics of adsorbed particles at a flat interface @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on the behavior of colloidal particles at liquid interfaces see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , the most paradigmatic example constitutes the collection of granular anisotropic particles confined between two parallel plates with the distance between them less than the particle widths .",
    "a growing number of experimental works conducted on granular fluids subjected to different vibrational modes show spatial pattern formations , demixing scenarios of granular species and collective motions @xcite .",
    "those systems in which granular rods are vertically shacked have shown that the entropic nature of interactions between particles is very important in the explanation of phenomenology found .",
    "in particular , the presence of defects of the nematic director due to the difference between particle orientations near and far from the walls was found @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on granular rods reported the presence of certain liquid - crystal textures with n , tetratic ( t ) , and smectic ( sm ) symmetries as the stationary states of these systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong dissipation due to the inelastic interactions between grains is an important ingredient to take into account in any theoretical model of a shaken granular systems .",
    "however , the presence of demixed stationary states of a granular mixture could be described by models based of density functional theory .",
    "for example the ranges of molar and packing fractions for which the demixing is observed could be approximately given by these models .",
    "the spt shows that a two - dimensional mixture of hard convex bodies never demixes into two i phases @xcite .",
    "however , recently we have shown that the same theory can predict i - n and n - n demixing @xcite .",
    "the only difference with respect to three dimensions is the second order character of the i - n transition at pressures bellow the tricritical point @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to implement the spt for ( i ) a mixture of hard ellipses ( he s ) with different aspect ratios and/or particle areas and ( ii ) for crossed - mixtures composed of he s and hard rectangles ( hr ) .",
    "the most convex particle with a fixed aspect ratio that can be imagined in two dimensions is just an ellipse .",
    "this property in turn might be reflected in the phase behavior of mixtures composed of he s .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case by studying the phase diagram topology as a function of particle aspect ratio and particle area .",
    "the one - component fluid of he s has been studied via monte carlo simulations .",
    "this fluid exhibits , for high enough aspect ratios , an i - n transition occurring via the disclination unbinding mechanism , while for higher packing fractions a first order fluid - solid transition takes place @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the equation of state for the one - component fluid of he s following the spt compares reasonable well with the simulation results @xcite .",
    "to implement the present study we firstly find an analytical expression for the excluded area between two he s with different axes @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "zheng and palffy - muhoray @xcite developed a method based on the calculation of the distance of closest approach between an ellipse and a circle .",
    "thus , after rescaling the circle they obtained the distance of closest approach between two ellipses . finally , the excluded area can be obtained by the angular integration of the distance of closest approach .",
    "however , this integral should be evaluated numerically .",
    "we will follow another procedure , in which the excluded area between two different ellipses can be calculated from the parametrization of the distance of closest approach as a function of the angle that forms the point of contact between two ellipses with a fixed reference axis .",
    "the resulting excluded area thus depends on the complete elliptic integral with its parameter being a function of the ellipse eccentricities and on the relative angle between particles .",
    "further , we also calculate the excluded area between an ellipse and a rectangle .",
    "the details of both calculations are relegated to the appendices .",

    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath82 two of the curves intersect ( those corresponding to the mixture of he s and the crossed - mixture ) . to illustrate the effect of this cross - over on the phase behavior we plot in figure [ demix ] the spinodals of both types of mixtures for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are located at different sides of the cross - over point",

    "we begin the presentation of the results from the most simple binary mixture : a mixture of he s .",
    "note that the hard disk ( hd ) is a special case of ellipse with equal semi - axis .",
    "the phase diagram topologies we show here are similar to those obtained for mixtures of hrs and hard discorectangles ( hdrs ) in recent studies @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown all possible demixing scenarios that mixtures of two - dimensional hard convex particles can exhibit . however",
    ", we will show that the ellipse , being the geometry with the most convex anisotropy we can imagine , considerably enhance the demixing transition in mixtures of particles with elliptical shapes .",
    "the first binary mixture we study is composed of he s and hds .",
    "the former has an aspect ratio of @xmath85 while the area of both species are the same ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure [ fig1 ] as a pressure  he molar fraction ( @xmath87 ) plot . as we can see from this figure , at low pressures",
    "the mixture exhibits a second order i - n phase transition up to pressure value of @xmath88 ( the location of a tricritical point ) above which the system demixes into an i phase rich in hds and a n phase rich in he s .",
    "the demixing gap is wider as the pressure increases from the tricritical point .",
    "we should point out that the second order i - n transition obtained from density functional calculations replace the kosterlitz - thouless i - n transition obtained by simulations and theoretical models that properly account for the nematic director fluctuations .",
    "the spt theory does not includes these fluctuations , thus predicting a continuous increase of the long range nematic ordering .",
    "the second study we have carried out concerns the calculation of the phase diagram of two similar binary mixtures of he s , again with the same particle area @xmath86 but with different aspect ratios given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the first mixture [ figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) ] while they are @xmath91 and @xmath90 for the second mixture [ figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "there is an important difference between both phase diagrams in that the first one has a region of i - n demixing above the tricritical point [ see figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) ] which is replaced at higher pressures by a n - n demixing ( just when the i - n spinodal intersects the i binodal of the i - n coexistence ) .",
    "we call this point a critical end point .",
    "the i phase as usual is rich in he species with small aspect ratio .",
    "the second phase diagram exhibits a second order i - n transition for all compositions and at higher pressures the system demix into two different n phases .",
    "this n - n demixing transition ends at a critical point .",
    "how affects the difference in particle areas on the phase behavior constitutes the following point we have elucidated .",
    "the aspect ratios of both ellipses are again @xmath91 and @xmath90 while the ratio between particle areas is @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the resulting phase diagram . again appears a window of i - n demixing but now the stability region of the second nematic ( n@xmath93 ) shrinks considerably .",
    "now we consider a mixture of he s with the same aspect ratios @xmath94 and different areas , specifically @xmath95 .",
    "the phase diagram is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this mixture exhibits two tricritical points defining the lower and upper limits of the i - n demixing and two critical points defining the proper limits of the n - n phase separation . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "the molar fraction of the first species is substituted by its area fraction , i.e. @xmath96 . in such a way",
    "the position of all these points can be properly discerned .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of mixtures of particles with different shapes , specifically he- and hr - shaped particles .",
    "the first crossed  mixture we have studied is composed of species with aspect ratios coinciding with those of the already studied he mixture with phase diagram plotted in figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "specifically the hr has the larger aspect ratio ( @xmath91 ) while the he has @xmath90 , and the areas of booth particles coincide .",
    "the aspect ratio of the rectangular particles is selected so as to be large enough to forbid the t phase stability @xcite . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the phase diagram of this mixture . in the same figure we plot for a better comparison the phase diagram of figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "we can extract two main differences between both phase diagrams .",
    "firstly , the i - n transition occurs at lower pressures for the he mixture .",
    "this feature is related to the change in the excluded area as the particle aligns preferentially along the nematic director .",
    "this change is larger in mixtures of he s compared with crossed  mixtures .",
    "the other main difference is related to the size of the n - n demixing gap .",
    "the crossed  mixture has the wider gap which can be understood in terms of packing of particles at high pressures : particles with the same shape pack better than those with different shapes .",
    "this in turn has already been quantified in section [ nn ] through the coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the last study we have carried out is related to the effect that different particle shapes have on the phase diagrams of binary mixtures with species having very dissimilar areas ( specifically @xmath99 ) but equal aspect ratios ( which were fixed to @xmath100 ) . to this purpose we have calculated the phase diagrams of a mixture of he s ( the dotted lines in figure [ fig6 ] ) , a crossed  mixture of heis and hrs with rectangles being the large species ( the solid line in figure [ fig6 ] ) and the opposite mixture with the ellipses being the large species ( the dot - dashed line in figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "as we can see from this figure the lower i - n spinodal corresponds to the mixture of he s which is related to the major gain in the excluded area by the particle alignment of the most convex species , the he s .",
    "for the same reason , we expect that the i - n demixing region is widened for crossed - mixtures with ellipses being the large species .",
    "the mixture of he s and hrs , the later being the large species , has the smallest demixing gap which is related to the fact that a great amount of large rectangles enhances the stability of the isotropic phase with respect to the nematic , due to the disordered effect that cause the rectangular corners . finally , the scenario with an intermediate demixing gap occurs for mixtures of he s .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present work has been to encourage the statistical mechanical study of two - dimensional mixtures of hard anisotropic particles as a starting point to understand the phenomenology inherent in mixtures of granular particles . while three - dimensional mixtures have been systematically studied via density functional calculations and by mc simulations ,",
    "there is a lack of results on two - dimensional mixtures , with scarce theoretical works and no simulation results .",
    "we have shown here that the phenomenology inherent to these mixtures are as rich as the three - dimensional mixtures , with all possible demixing scenarios where the demixed phases have isotropic or nematic symmetries .",
    "the absence of i - i demixing and the presence of second order i - n transition constitute the main differences with respect to the three - dimensional case .",
    "while mixtures of hard particles with rectangular and disco - rectangular geometries have been recently studied with density functional tools @xcite , the present work constitutes the first attempt to incorporate the elliptical geometry into these studies . for a given aspect ratio",
    "the ellipse is the most convex particle we can imagine .",
    "as we have shown here , this geometrical property is translated to the the phase diagram topologies of mixtures with one or both species being ellipses .",
    "we trust that the same kind of results can be found in mixtures of ellipsoidal and cylindrical granular rods , the basmati rice being an important paradigm of the former .",
    "we should take the conclusions about the stability of uniform phases that the spt predicts with certain caution .",
    "phase transitions to non - uniform phases , such as smectic or crystalline phases , can occur at pressures bellow the maximum values depicted in the phase diagrams plotted here .",
    "only a full minimization of a density functional with respect to the density profile @xmath101 ( depending also on the spatial variables ) can clarify this problem .",
    "a density functional for mixtures of he s based on the parsons approach can in principle be implemented for the general density profile inhomogeneities .",
    "however this functional treats the translational degrees of freedoms in a crude approximation , wich is a serious drawback for two - dimensional systems where the many - body correlations are very important .",

    "in this section we calculate the excluded area between two different ellipses . the center of an ellipse with semi - axis @xmath102 and @xmath103 will be placed at the origin of the coordinate system with the major semi - axis @xmath103 being parallel to the @xmath104 cartesian axis .",

    "<S> we present a scaled particle density functional study of two - dimensional binary mixtures of hard convex particles with one or both species being ellipses . in particular , we divide our study into two parts . the first part is devoted to the calculation of phase diagrams of mixtures with the same elliptical shapes , but with ( i ) different aspect ratios and equal particle areas , ( ii ) equal aspect ratios and different particle areas and ( iii ) with the former and the later being different . in the second study we obtain the phase diagrams corresponding to crossed - mixtures of particles with species having elliptical and rectangular shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the phase diagram topologies and explain their main features from the entropic nature of particle interactions directly related to the anisotropies , areas , and shapes of species . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained can be corroborated by experiments on granular rods where the entropic forces are very important in the stabilization of liquid - crystal textures at the stationary states . </S>"
