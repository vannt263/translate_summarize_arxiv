    "* aldous : * you were interviewed in october 1984 for a _ statistical science _ conversation article  @xcite , so i  wo nt ask about your earlier personal and academic life , but try to pick up from that point .",
    "you and i  were both involved , in the early 1980s , with the start of the topic now often labeled `` markov chains and mixing times ''  @xcite .",
    "can you tell us your recollections of early days , and give some overview of how the whole topic has developed over the last 30 years?=-1    * diaconis : * that s been the main focus of my work since the 1980s , and it started for me with an applied problem .",
    "i  was working at bell labs and we were simulating optimal strategies in various games and needed a lot of random permutations . the standard way is to pick a random number between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and switch it with @xmath0 , then pick a random number between @xmath2 and @xmath1 and switch it with @xmath2 , etc . if you do that @xmath3 times , it s exactly random .",
    "we got the results of many hours of cpu time of simulations and something looked wrong .",
    "there were 2000 lines of code and we looked for a mistake .",
    "after three days we asked , `` how did you generate the random permutations ? '' the lady said , `` you said that fussy thing but i  made it more random ",
    "i  switched a random card with another random card . ''",
    "i  said , `` you have to redo the simulations '' and she said , `` it s crazy . ''",
    "then she went to her boss and he went to his boss and he came down and yelled at me . `` you mathematicians are crazy  she did a hundred transpositions and that has to be enough with 52 cards . ''",
    "so i  really wanted to know the answer ",
    "how many transpositions does it take to mix 52 cards ?",
    "i  came back to the west coast in the early 1980s , talked with people like you and rick durrett and we saw that if you did it for order @xmath4 times that would be enough     * aldous : *  by an easy coupling argument ",
    "* diaconis : *  but it was nt clear if that was the right answer .",
    "eventually mehrdad shahshahani was here and we realized we could set it up as a problem in fourier analysis and carefully do the fourier analysis on a noncommutative group and get the right answer and it turned out  @xcite to be @xmath5 , which when @xmath6 gives @xmath7 .",
    "that was for me the start of it . and in 1983",
    "you wrote this article @xcite on mixing times for markov chains . around the same time",
    "jim reeds had become interested in riffle shuffling .",
    "he had reinvented a model that gilbert and shannon had invented and had numerical results and ideas but could nt seem to push them through .",
    "you and i  started to talk about it and invented stopping time arguments  @xcite that turned out to give good answers in some cases . spurred on by these two examples i  started to think hard about mixing times .",
    "around the same time , what i  now call `` the markov chain monte carlo revolution ''  @xcite began with the paper by geman and geman @xcite .",
    "so the topic of mixing times became about more than just card shuffling , it was also about how long should you run a simulation until it converges .",
    "i  say now , as i  said then , that if you take any application of mcmc in a real problem and ask if we theoreticians can give a sensible answer to a practitioner about `` how long  , '' then we ca nt .",
    "these are open research problems , every one of them .",
    "we have ideas , we have heuristics , but as math problems they are really open .",
    "a fitting proof of that is the following : the metropolis algorithm , glauber dynamics , the gibbs sampler and molecular dynamics were all invented to solve one problem , the problem of random placement of hard discs in a box .",
    "take , say , two - dimensional discs of radius @xmath8 in the unit square .",
    "you want them to be uniform random subject to nonoverlap .",
    "the metropolis algorithm is that you pick a disc at random , you try to move it a little , if it s possible to move then do it , if not then try another pick .",
    "glauber dynamics is similar .",
    "but as far as i  know  despite billions of steps of simulations over the last 60 years  nobody has ever sampled from anything close to the stationary distribution , in the interesting case of high disc density .",
    "there s supposed to be a phase transition around 81% , but the algorithms have no hope of converging near that point and yet people get numbers from the simulations and talk about them .",
    "i  think the same goes for statistical algorithms too  people who do nt want to think about it just run the simulation until something seems to have settled down .",
    "so i  think the current state of the art is there s a ton of research still to be done ; everyone finds us theoreticians annoying prigs for asking what can you show rigorously .",
    "but it s not just being annoying . in enough cases",
    "the algorithms really do nt converge , and people do nt seem to want to own up to that . in  @xcite we tried pretty seriously to do the hard discs problem , but there s still a very long way to go .",
    "* aldous : * now there s a distinction between `` do nt converge '' and `` we ca nt prove they do converge ''  and there s an argument that in practice one uses `` black box '' methods like mcmc in complicated situations where you do nt have any nice structure , whereas to do any theoretical analysis you need to assume some structure , so we ( perhaps ) are in a catch-22 situation where one can do theory for mcmc only in situations where you would nt actually use it .",
    "and then you have to rely on the heuristics that applied researchers have developed .",
    "* diaconis : * well at least for the chemists i  talk to , who study molecular dynamics , they havent converged , they re in some kind of local minimum , and really dramatically new ideas are needed . i  think a very interesting research question is to look at the zoo of diagnostic techniques that are available today , and look at the hundreds of examples of markov chains about which we know everything .",
    "take some of those examples and diagnostic techniques and try to see how they behave .",
    "that seems like a very reasonable thing to do .",
    "i ve tried for 20 years to get a graduate student to do this , but somehow i  ca nt get anyone to sit down and do the work .",
    "i  should have learned i  need to do it myself .",
    "they re hard math problems .",
    "the diagnostics can be pretty sophisticated ; they re not just second eigenvalue but involve _ sups _ and _ infs _ of complicated functionals .",
    "we do have a lot of machinery and they re nice math problems so this project would be useful to help evaluate diagnostics . what s annoying to me is how little that problem is recognized .",
    "if you go to a statistics meeting , in talk after talk somebody runs the gibbs sampler because that s the standard thing to do , and they say they ran it 10,000 times and it seemed to be ok , and they just go on with what they re doing . people do nt even try to prove the chain does what it s supposed to do , that is , have the desired stationary distribution .",
    "* aldous : * let me move on to bayesian statistics , which has been a recurrent feature of your research .",
    "maybe i  should remind readers that 30 years ago this was completely unrelated to markov chains , but now a major use of mcmc is for computing bayes posteriors  but let s leave mcmc for later .",
    "i m not competent to ask good questions here , so let me just throw out two points and then i ll sit back and listen .",
    "\\(a ) you have work , such as the 1986 paper  @xcite with david freedman , that addresses foundational technical ( rather than philosophical ) issues in bayesian statistics .",
    "\\(b ) there is a recent newsletter piece by mike jordan  @xcite summarizing comments by many leading bayesian statisticians ( including you ) on open problems in bayesian statistics .",
    "so i  guess i  am asking for your thoughts on the history and current state of methodological / technical aspects of bayesian statistics .",
    "* diaconis : * i  came into statistics late in life , becoming aware of the bayesian position when i  was a graduate student at harvard .",
    "art dempster and fred mosteller were bayesians  not everyone , bill cochran would nt dream of doing anything bayesian .",
    "i  read de finetti s work and found it frustrating and fascinating , as i  still do today , but it was inspiring and so i  tried to make my own sense out of it",
    ". one of the things i  noticed was that de finetti s theorem involves an infinite exchangeable sequence .",
    "i  wondered whether there could be a finite version , saying the sequence is almost a mixture of iids .",
    "in fact , i  wrote my first paper on that topic when i  was still a graduate student  @xcite .",
    "that was when i  came to meet the berkeley people ",
    "david freedman and lester dubins and david blackwell , the latter two being bayesians of various stripes  and , in fact , david freedman s thesis ( published as  @xcite ) was about de finetti s theorem for markov chains .",
    "the story , in a nutshell , is that david was a precocious but difficult young man who wanted to do a thesis in probability , and ( the way david told it ) he went into feller s office and feller looked up , said , `` prove de finetti s theorem for markov chains , '' looked back down , and david left .",
    "so he went and did it . in order to prove the theorem",
    ", he needed to assume the chain was stationary .",
    "when i  met him at a berkeley - stanford joint colloquium , i  said that i  knew how to do it without stationarity .",
    "i  could make a finite version of the theorem and it did nt need anything like stationarity .",
    "he agreed to listen , and lester did too .",
    "lester was very dismissive , but david was nt , and that led to our work on finite versions of both the markov and the iid cases @xcite .",
    "i ve written far too many papers .",
    "i ll try to distinguish the ones that people seem to like into statistics or probability or something in between .",
    "you presented me with a list of papers ",
    "* aldous : * your 30 most cited papers , according to google scholar ,    * diaconis : *  and about a third are statistics and a third are probability and a third are in between , like de finetti s theorem , which i  was interested in for philosophical reasons , trying to make sense of the way model - building goes .",
    "i  like de finetti s take , focusing on observables , and i d like to understand just what you need to assume about a process , in terms of observables , in order for it to be a mixture of standard parametric families , a mixture of exponential or normals or some other thing . that led to a lot of work  @xcite .",
    "that era seems to have quieted way down  nowadays no one works on exchangeability particularly , though a few of us still dabble in it.=1    about a year ago , some of our chemists here came to me .",
    "they were working on a protein folding problem with the ibm blue gene project .",
    "they re really doing protein folding  taking forty molecules and ten thousand water molecules and then doing the molecular dynamics to see how the protein folds by using the equations of physics .",
    "it s a very high - dimensional system  one particle is represented by twelve numbers  and the chemists were coarse - graining and dividing this high - dimensional space into maybe five thousand boxes .",
    "their hope is that within a box it will quickly get random  in the sense of invariant measure for a dynamical system  and that jumps from box to box can be modeled as some markov chain .",
    "refreshingly to me , they were bayesians , so they wanted to put a prior on transition matrices and , because the laws of physics are reversible , they wanted the prior to live on reversible chains .",
    "i  realized that some earlier work with silke rolles  @xcite exactly gave the conjugate prior for reversible markov chains .",
    "i  told them about it , they implemented it and they say it makes a big difference .",
    "there s a marvelous graduate student here , sergio bacallado , he s a chemist , and he s written papers such as  @xcite in the annals which extends our work on priors in more practical directions",
    ". there s something very exciting here  our old work had horrible formulas involving quotients of gamma functions and now someone is caring to get it right , and thinking it s sensible .",
    "so that subject is quite alive and well today , although sergio has taken it a lot further .",
    "one of the main problems for markov chain theory is to make the mixing time theory for continuous - space chains .",
    "there really are technical difficulties for continuous spaces , and he s managed to get around that .    now in a larger view , it s a very exciting time for bayesian statistics . when i  first learned about it , in the early 1970s , it was still good and savage , and people were still arguing about whether an egg in a fridge is rotten or not ",
    "* aldous : *  and the bayesian lady tasting tea .",
    "* diaconis : * i  remember going to my first valencia meeting",
    ". one of the world s leading bayesians , john pratt , a marvelous man , was analyzing some data , his wife s estimates of upcoming gross receipts at a cinema where she worked in cambridge , ma .",
    "he was doing regression , and at the end he did an ordinary least squares but nothing bayesian @xcite .",
    "i  asked him why not bayesian ?",
    "he said it was too hard to figure out the priors and it would nt have made any difference anyway .",
    "i  was shocked and dumbfounded .",
    "that was 1983 , but since then we can actually implement bayesian methods . and we do .",
    "now the judgement has to be put off ",
    "frequentist methods have had 200 years of people tinkering with them and we re just starting to use bayesian methods .",
    "i  think it s reasonable to let time settle down before deciding whether they are better or worse .",
    "there are lots and lots of groups doing bayesian analysis .",
    "one of the big tensions in statistics , which is a mystery to me , is really big data sets .",
    "you can try to estimate huge numbers of parameters with very few data points .",
    "now i  understand sometimes there s a story that seeks to justify that , but it makes me very , very nervous . if you try to think about being a bayesian in that kind of problem , it ca nt be that you have any idea about what priors you re putting on , you re completely making something up .",
    "it s nothing other than a way of suggesting procedures .",
    "it might be useful , it might not be useful .",
    "there are a lot of people trying to do that , but it s a completely different part of the world and i  do nt have much feeling for it .",
    "it s so taken over statistics right at the moment that i  feel compelled to put in the following sentence .",
    "there _ are _ huge data sets ; there _ are _ also many , many small data sets . and that s where the inferential subtleties matter . if you re sick and you re trying to think about a new procedure for your tooth and there are two available procedures , with 10 or 50 instances of each",
    "what should you do ?",
    "statistics encounters lots of problems like this too .",
    "so it s good to remember that while there are huge data sets and that s very exciting , there are also lots of small data sets and there s still room for the classical way of thinking about statistical problems .",
    "* aldous : * a cynical view is that there s more money in the fields with big data sets .",
    "* diaconis : * tsk tsk ( laughs ) , you wo nt get any argument from me .",
    "* aldous : * you teach an undergraduate course with brian skyrms on the philosophical foundations of statistics .",
    "you describe its topic as `` 10 great ideas about chance . ''",
    "now most readers of _ statistical science _ have surely never taken , let alone taught , such a course .",
    "can you tell us about the course ?",
    "* diaconis : * philosophers and statisticians havethought for a very long time about what probabilistic statements mean and how to combine disparate sources of information to reach a conclusion .",
    "these are still important questions and not ones to which we know the answer .",
    "we begin our course with the first great idea , that probability can be measured  the emergence of equally likely cases , the first probability calculations .",
    "there is of course a discussion of frequentism and of various kinds of bayesians . indeed , i.j .",
    "good once wrote an article entitled 46656 _ varieties of bayesians _ where he states 11 `` facets '' like whether utility is emphasized or avoided , whether physical probabilities are denied or allowed , and so on .",
    "we try to explain some of the different kinds of bayesians .",
    "brian and i  are both subjectivists ",
    "i  am what i  call a nonreligious bayesian , that is , _",
    "i _ find it useful and interesting and i  do nt really care what _ you _ do .",
    "some of the course is pointing out the shallowness of naive frequentism .",
    "bayesians are happy to talk about frequencies , in that when you have a lot of data the data swamps the prior , and you will use the frequency in order to make your inferences .",
    "it s not that bayesians argue against frequencies , they re happy to have a lot of data , and frequencies are forced on you by the mathematics .",
    "so we discuss and prove those things .",
    "we also explain von mises collectives , which have morphed into the complexity approach to probability.=-1    one of the things i  find interesting that s hard to make philosophy out of , is what i  want to call the von mises pragmatic approach .",
    "if you ask working statisticians what they think probability is , they say , well , you do something a lot of times , and it s the proportion of times something happens .",
    "if you ask about the probability obama will be re - elected , they will respond with a cloud of words . or they ll walk away or say it s too difficult to talk about .",
    "what von mises said is that any scientific area has practice and theory .",
    "he discusses geometry ",
    "there s the mathematical notion of circles and straight lines , then there s practical architecture and drawing",
    ". the theory can be used , but at some point you have to relate the theory to the real world .",
    "i  think that sort of pragmatic approach to foundations is important . but",
    "von mises never tells you how to do so .",
    "i  ask this question for differential equations .",
    "if some guy writes down a differential equation , and there s a picture of water whirling around in a vessel with blockages  what does that equation have to do with the whirling of the water ? in order to answer that , many of us would say , `` that s what statistics is about . '' whether theory fits data is a statistical question . so we can apply this to our own subject :",
    "does statistical theory fit the real world ?",
    "anyway , we hope to turn the course into a book , after several years of iterations .",
    "* aldous : * what kind of students take the course ?",
    "* diaconis : * about 70 students , undergraduates or graduates in statistics or philosophy , and just interested other people , even some faculty attend .",
    "it s quite lively , there s lots of discussion .",
    "we teach it once a week for three hours , which is exhausting for everyone concerned .    trying to think about why we do what we do is important , but nobody talks about it .",
    "i  tell the following two stories .",
    "one is about you , and one is about brad efron . at some stage you and i  were talking , as we often do , and i  said i  was going to teach a course on the philosophy of probability .",
    "and you got quite irate , saying , `` you re just going to tell a bunch of words that wo nt illuminate anything . '' and my good friend efron got similarly very angry .",
    "he said , `` that s just going to be that bayesian garbage , '' reached into his pocket , took out a handful of coins , threw them , and said , `` look : head , tail , tail , ",
    "_that s _ random . ''",
    "so people hear `` philosophy '' and take it in a religious way . to me ,",
    "the question `` is what you re doing really _ about _ anything ? '' is worth discussing , and we re just trying to talk about it .",
    "if you want to know what the problems in bayesian statistics are , ask a bayesian . we know !",
    "it s very hard to put meaningful priors on high - dimensional real problems . and",
    "the choices can really make a difference .",
    "i m going to give one example of that , just for fun .",
    "suppose you re teaching an elementary probability course .",
    "it s the first day of term , you walk into class , you see there are 26 students in the class , so you decide to do the birthday problem . here",
    "are two thoughts about the birthday problem .",
    "first , if it does nt work , then it s a disastrous way to start a course .",
    "second , the usual calculation assumes each day is equally likely .",
    "but my students are about the same age , and there are more births on weekdays than weekend - days  that s about a 20% effect  and then there are smaller seasonal effects",
    ". so the uniformity might not be true for my class .",
    "we do nt really know what the probabilities are .",
    "so let me put a prior on @xmath9 . if your prior is uniform on the simplex , then the key number of people ( to have a 50% chance of some birthday coincidence ) decreases from 26 to about 18 .",
    "for the coupon collector s problem , using a story that feller suggested , the key number of people in a village ( to have a 50% chance that every day is someone s birthday ) is about 2300 .",
    "that s under the uniform multinomial model .",
    "if instead you take the uniform prior on the simplex , then  it s a slightly harder calculation to do ",
    "but if i  remember , the key number increases to about 190,000 .",
    "that s a little surprising when you first hear it , but under the uniform prior some @xmath10 will be around @xmath11 so you need order @xmath12 people just to have a good chance of having that one day as a birthday .    * aldous : * but is nt this a good argument against the naive bayesian idea of inventing priors that are mathematically simple but without any real - world reason ?",
    "* diaconis : * sure , and that was the point of the exercise .",
    "bayesian statisticians _ should _ be thinking more carefully about their priors .",
    "part of that is understanding the effect of different priors , and those are math problems . in the birthday problem , mathshowed the prior did nt have too much effect , whereas for the coupon collector s problem it had a huge effect .",
    "susan holmes and i  wrote a paper called _ a bayesian peek into feller volume _",
    "i @xcite taking his elementary problems and making bayesian versions of them .",
    "when does it make a difference and when not ?",
    "it s a paper i  like a lot .",
    "* aldous : * a version of the nonuniform birthday problem i  give in my own `` probability and the real world '' course  @xcite is to take @xmath13 for half the days and @xmath14 for the other half .",
    "this makes surprisingly little difference  the key number decreases from 23 to 22 . and to avoid the possible disaster of it failing with my students , i  show the active roster of a baseball team ( easily found online ; each mlb team has a page in the same format ) which conveniently has 25 players and their birth dates .",
    "the predicted chance of a birthday coincidence is about 57% . with 30 mlb teams one expects around 17 teams to have the coincidence",
    "; and one can readily check this prediction in class in a minute or so ( print out the 30 pages and distribute among students).=1",
    "* aldous : * on a lighter note , i  have found myself following in your footsteps in various aspects of academic life , a minor such aspect being `` unfinished books . ''",
    "the 1984 conversation refers to the book on coincidences you were writing with mosteller , and there is a 1989 joint paper  @xcite , but when can we expect to see the book ?    * diaconis : * well , there were two books mentioned in that interview , and the _ other _ one , with ron graham on mathematics and magic , has recently been published  @xcite .",
    "so it took 27 years , but we did finish it .",
    "i m starting to think about the coincidences book again .",
    "we re sitting in my office and you see those folders up there ",
    "* aldous : * i  see about 15 of those very wide old open - ended cardboard files ",
    "* diaconis : *  those folders have newspaper clippings collected by fred mosteller over 30 years , and every one has a few pages saying here s a kind of coincidence we might study via a model , and here s some back - of - an - envelope calculation .",
    "i  give a lot of public talks , about 50 a year , and i  had stopped giving the talk on coincidences , but i ve now committed to giving the talk again in a few weeks . that s how i  trick myself and get back into thinking about the topic",
    ". so look for the book sometime in the next five years .",
    "i  promised fred ( before he died in 2006 ) i  would do it , and i m going to gear up and do it.=1    * aldous : * the colorful story of you running away from home at age 14 to do magic , then buying feller and teaching yourself enough mathematics to understand it , was told in the 1984 interview , and has become well known in our community .",
    "but i ve joked to students `` if you meet the queen of england , do nt slap her on the back ; if you meet persi diaconis , do nt ask him to do a magic trick . ''",
    "now that you and ron graham have published the book on mathematics and magic  @xcite , could you tell us a little about what s in the book ?",
    "* diaconis : * the reason i  first got interested in mathematics was via magic .",
    "i  had hoped to call the book _ mathematics to magic and back _ , but the publisher vetoed that , saying people would nt get the idea . now it s called _ magical mathematics : the mathematical ideas that animate great magic tricks _ , maybe a bit pompous .",
    "one of the things about mathematics and magic is that if some person says,``i  know a card trick , '' you wince inside , because they re going to deal cards into piles on the table , and everyone s going to fall asleep . how long until i  can change the conversation ?",
    "we re interested in _ good _ magic tricks , which are performable and do nt look mathematical , but which have some math behind them . some of the math turns out to be pretty interesting .",
    "most of the tricks are ones we invented ourselves , which is why we do nt get strung up for revealing secrets ; the magic community does nt like that , but we seem to get away with it .",
    "there s not much probability in the book",
    " there s some material on riffle shuffles and that sort of thing  and some old tricks of charles jordan that we made mathematical sense of . to whet your appetite , there s a chapter on the connection between riffle shuffles and the mandlebrot set .",
    "* aldous : * science has a notion of progress  onecould take any scientific topic and write a nontechnical article on progress in that topic over the last 30 years .",
    "is there an analog of progress in magic ?",
    "* diaconis : * here i m a bit negative .",
    "the final chapters are about who are the current stars  who is inventing tricks that are new and really different ?",
    "the people we describe are old or now departed .",
    "the younger people do nt seem to be inventing math - based tricks .",
    "but in the coming quarter i ll be teaching a course on mathematics and magic here at stanford , so i m trying to cultivate young people myself .",
    "magic is changing in many ways , and the main one is again negative . because of wikipedia and youtube there are very few secrets any more .",
    "you could be watching a show and type the right words into your smartphone and get an explanation , and this wo nt go away .",
    "it s profoundly changing magic , likely not for the better .",
    "now i  do have a positive hope ",
    "maybe this will encourage people to invent new and better tricks . also ",
    "when i  was a kid , i  was once hanging around with my magic mentor dai vernon at a billiard parlor .",
    "billiards is a very refined game , the gentleman s version of pool .",
    "now pool halls are notoriously rowdy , smoke - filled with gambling and drinking .",
    "this was a group of people , seated around two masters , playing three - cushion billiards .",
    "the crowd was silent aside from an occasional quiet _",
    "ooh _ of appreciation .",
    "vernon looked at me and said , `` would nt it be wonderful if people watched magic that way . ''",
    "if people would learn a bit more about magic and appreciate the skill and presentation , then maybe it would become like watching a classical violinist .",
    "those are my dreams about how exposure might change magic for the better .",
    "* aldous : * we ve already mentioned david freedman , my long - time colleague at berkeley , and perhaps your major collaborator , who sadly died in 2008 .",
    "i  regarded him as one of the handful of people in our business who are unique  there was nobody _ like _ david .",
    "i  mentally pictured him as mycroft holmes ( sherlock s smarter older brother , who appears briefly in several stories to give sage advice ) and i  recall you having some `` bright light '' image .",
    "can you tell us some things about your collaborations and about david s impact on the field ?",
    "* diaconis : * i  first met david at a berkeley - stanford joint colloquium barbeque at tom cover s house .",
    "i  had read his thesis when i  was a graduate student , so i  had something to say to him .",
    "he was a very crusty character .",
    "he had a kind of `` gee shucks , i m just a farm boy '' outer style , but he was in fact the debating champion of canada .",
    "he was an honest man , and there are nt so many of _",
    "them_. he could be difficult .",

    "when he was focused it was like there was this very bright clear light on a narrow part of the problem , and then it would shift slightly over and focus on a next part .",
    "that was how he worked .",
    "he was nt a quick glib guy .    at some stage",
    "he decided that the main impact he could make in statistics was what he called _ defensive statistics , _ which was trying to make an art and science out of critiquing knee - jerk modeling and the wild misuse of probability models .",
    "he was as effective as anyone ever has been at that .",
    "was he actually effective ?",
    "maybe not in our business , but he has a following in some of the social sciences and that s marvelous .",

    "david s approach to what we should do was embodied in the last book he wrote  @xcite .",
    "he spent years writing out with infinite clarity about topics he had such scorn for .",
    "i  had never quite understood why he put so much energy into expounding ( e.g. ) the cox proportional hazards model or the mysteries of regression .",
    "then he said to me , as if it were obvious , though it had nt occurred to me before : `` if i  say it really , really clearly , then people will see how crazy it is . ''",
    "david was a brilliant mathematician .",
    "i  miss him daily , because we used to chat all the time .",
    "and i  could ask him anything , from `` where to eat '' to fine points of nonmeasurable sets .",
    "this continued until a few years before his death .",
    "we had written 33 papers together , and i m a shoot - from - the - hip guy in writing first drafts , and david was very careful , and very artful in his prose , and finally we got rather tired of each other , like an old married couple  we felt we had heard everything the other had to say .",
    "i  found his constant negativity draining , and he found my constant enthusiasm draining .",
    "but we had been a pretty good pair for a long time .    right now ,",

    "infinite products are often not well - defined .",
    "i m sure there s some technical way of fixing that .",
    "it s the kind of thing where david would have said , `` let s think about it , '' and some nice math would have come out of it .",
    "now , with david gone , i  do nt know who to ask about such things , i  do nt know who cares about measure theory any more .",

    "are there others during your later career , not already mentioned , who you would like to talk about ?    * diaconis : * well , there s you , with exchangability and card shuffling and mixing in mcmc , and statistics and probability in the real world . and laurent saloff - coste , an analyst who i ve converted to be somewhat of a probabilist .",
    "he was visiting dan stroock , and at that time was very far from probability , and we got into an argument , and he was right and i  was wrong .    i ve written a lot of papers with ron graham .",

    "i ve written papers with susan holmes , my wife , and that has its complexity .",
    "one of the most stressful things , for each of us , is to hear the other give a talk on our joint work . you sit there thinking , `` no , no , no , that s not the way to say it , '' and you have to keep quiet .",
    "we ve all had this experience with a graduate student , but when it s your wife it s radically worse .",

    "i  do nt write so many papers with my graduate students  they should get the credit for their work  but one i  have resumed working with is jason fulman .",
    "i  enjoy working with him because he starts with a natural algebraic bent , but i  taught him to look at a formula and look for some probability story , and he s great at it .",

    "diaconis : * sometimes when interviewing postdocs , they think they can come to stanford and have _ you _ work on _ their _ problem . or they just want to work on their own thing by themselves .",

    "right now i m doing some work in algebraic topology , a subject with enormous depth , but many of the prominent practitioners are involved in the minutiae of how the big machine works and do nt bother to solve real problems .",
    "they just think that if the machine is well enough developed , then it can solve any problem that s handed to it .",
    "i  do think it s important to try to focus on real world problems .",
    "a lot of my motivation is mcmc , which is really used on real problems , and , as i  said earlier , we do nt know how to give theoretical analyses of mcmc on real problems .",
    "so what we do is problems with nice structure , say , symmetry , and hope that will grow into something useful .",
    "von neumann s quote is perfect  you make a small change in a solved problem , it s still not real , you ca nt do it but one of your students makes progress , and an area grows and gets a name",
    ". it does happen that way .",
    "of course it s easy to criticize .",
    "one way i  try to be constructive is take a classic like the original metropolis algorithm applied to hard discs in a box .",
    "can i  prove anything about it ?",
    "i  worked very hard for five years with wonderful analysts .",
    "we wrote papers  @xcite in the best math journals .",
    "but our theorems are basically useless as regards the real problem .",
    "but again  sometimes things done because they were beautiful as pure math , then 50 years later it s just what somebody needed .",
    "a reasonable case in point is partial exchangeability for matrices , which david freedman and i  were working on in 1979 , and you independently came up with a proof .",
    "that was an esoteric corner of probability , and soon the subject went quiet for 20 years , but now it s completely re - emerged in contexts such as graph limits @xcite and other parts of pure math  @xcite .",
    "people are looking back at the old papers and asking how did they do that .",
    "i  just opened the _ annals of probability _ and there s an article on free probability versions of de finetti s theorem .",
    "is that probability , or some other area of math ?",
    "it s very hard to know what will turn out to be useful .    *",
    "aldous : * an unconventional idea for a workshop would be to invite senior people to talk about one nonrecent idea of theirs which has not been developed or followed up by others , but which ( the speaker thinks ) should be .",
    "following hammersley  @xcite , one might call these `` ungerminated seedlings of re - search . ''",
    "do you have any ideas in this category ?",
    "* diaconis : * there s a problem that i  worked on as part of my thesis but have never managed to get anyone else interested in .",
    "it s about summability .",
    "a  sequence of real numbers that does nt converge in the usual sense may be abel or cesaro summable .",
    "and there are theorems that say if a sequence is summable in scheme a , then it s summable in scheme b. i  noticed that any time there was such a known theorem , there was a probabilistic identity which said that the stronger method was an average of the weaker method .",
    "so is there a kind of meta - theorem that says this is always true ?",
    "i  once gave the hardy memorial lecture at cambridge and wrote a paper  @xcite titled _",
    "g.  h. hardy and probability ? ? ?",
    "_ with the three question marks .",
    "hardy notoriously did nt have much regard for applied math of any sort , and probability was particularly low on his list .",
    "he hated being remembered for the hardy  weinberg principle .",
    "i  knew paul erds well , and he said that hardy and littlewood were great mathematicians , but if they had had any knowledge of probability at all , then they would have been able to prove the law of the iterated logarithm . that they certainly had the techniques but because they just could nt think probabilistically their work on that particular problem was second - rate",
    "anyway , in the lecture i  wove together such stories and my own open problems about tauberian theory.=1    * aldous : * outside academia you are perhaps best known for magic and for the `` 7 shuffles suffice '' result from your 1992 paper with dave bayer  @xcite .",
    "i m sure that features in every other interview you ve done , so i  wo nt ask again here . more recent work of yours that attracted popular interest",
    "was the 2007 _ dynamical bias in the coin toss _",
    "paper @xcite , asserting ( by a mixture of newtonian physics and experimental observation of the initial parameters when real people performed tosses ) that there was about a 50.8% chance for a coin to land the same way up as tossed .",
    "i  had two undergraduates actually do the 40,000 tosses required to have a good chance of detecting this effect , but the results were ambiguous  @xcite .",
    "have you or other people followed up on your paper ?",
    "* diaconis : * aside from your students , there s a physics group at boston  @xcite who carefully repeated our measurements of angular velocity etc . , and a polish group who have written a book  @xcite on the physics of gambling .",
    "they reproduced our analysis and added bouncing and air resistance , which we neglected .",
    "speaking of coin - tossing , every year we get a call from espn and they want a two - minute spot on `` is the coin toss in the superbowl fair ? '' of course the superbowl coin is a big thick specially minted object , and i  do nt have much to say on that .",
    "i  recently got a letter from a german _ gymnasium _ teacher who tried to make a biased coin by making one side of balsa wood , and he could nt do it .",
    "i  wrote back saying that some coins are biased when you spin them on a flat surface , but for flipping in the air we can prove you ca nt make it biased     * aldous : *  by conservation of angular momentum , which a high school physics teacher should know .",
    "you may recall that two of our colleagues have a paper titled _ you can load a die , but you ca nt bias a coin _  @xcite .",
    "* aldous : * in the 1984 conversation , when askedabout the future you were wise enough not to make very specific predictions about particular topics , but i  do notice two points .",
    "you noted there was increasing collaboration``more and more 2- or 3-author papers''and we re all aware this trend has continued .",
    "the current ( october 2011 ) _ annals of statistics _ has only 2 out of 17 articles being single - authored , whereas going back 30 years ( september 1981 ) it was 10 out of  17 .",
    "incidently , the total length of the 17 articles increased from under 200 pages to almost 500 pages , a perhaps less predictable effect .",
    "your second point , paraphrasing slightly , was `` i m glad statistics is not that kind of high - pressure field where you have to publish every two weeks . '' but today we do have younger colleagues who publish fifteen papers per year .",
    "we can probably all agree that increased collaboration is a good thing , but what about the increased number of papers and the implicit pressure on young people to publish more than in our day ?",
    "* diaconis : * right now i m on the hiring committees for both the math and stat departments , and it s noticeable that even applicants straight out of grad school have 310 papers on their cv , many of them in pretty good journals .",
    "how has that happened ?",
    "when i  was at that stage i  just had some technical reports .",
    "so it s just a cultural change .",
    "we perceive an exponentially growing literature with just too many papers .",
    "people publish the most obscure things .",
    "but then the ability to search on the web allows us to keep track , and , as i  said earlier , sometimes the most obscure - looking paper turns out to contain just the right thing . and",
    "i  should be the last one to criticize there being too many papers , because i m now writing almost ten papers a year .",
    "i  would hate to have to choose which ones i  should nt have written .    in our field",
    "we still referee , or pretend to referee , papers , and we all know it can take six months or a year to get through .",
    "i  do some work with physicists and physics is largely an unrefereed subject .",
    "their logic is that if somebody publishes a wrong result , the community becomes aware of it , and then that group gets a bad reputation .",
    "it s not that no one looks at the paper at all ; someone reads the abstract and scans the paper to check it looks reasonable .",
    "then it gets published , in time maybe closer to three weeks than three months .",
    "so our field is moving in that direction .",
    "publication is less and less meaningful because of the arxiv .",
    "but as an author i  find it useful to imagine that some referee is going to read my paper .",
    "it makes me take care about the details and the exposition .",
    "* aldous : * your answer in 1984 to `` what does the future hold for you ? '' was `` just going crazy , working hard , learning more math . ''",
    "i  think we can agree that prediction was correct .",
    "so let me ask the same question again , and ask for your thoughts on the future of the field of statistics , and ask for advice to someone completing an undergraduate degree and contemplating starting a ph.d .",
    "program in statistics.=-1    * diaconis : * yes , i  still like working hard and learning more . over my career statistics has changed so drastically it s almost unrecognizable .",
    "companies like target predicting what their individual customers will want or can be persuaded to want  this kind of aggressive analysis of massive data sets .",
    "so there s a lot of new statistics for someone like me who s classically trained .",
    "you have to find a part of it you want to learn .",
    "for example , i m trying to think about large networks via general models for random graphs . and for a theoretical statistician , looking at what applied people are doing and asking , `` can i  break it , can i  do it better ? '' will always give us plenty to do .",
    "about what a youngster should do  for a start , you ca nt learn too much about using computers .",
    "i  lament that the academic statistics world does nt know how to recognize and reward that skill appropriately .",
    "there are people who are amazing hackers and that s an invaluable skill , but they do nt get the same credit as mathematically - focused people . i  do nt know why this is , but it should change .    *",
    "aldous : * presumably because of the traditional `` research @xmath15 papers in journals '' equation ",
    "were so used to assessing research contributions in that particular way . even though there are journals like _ journal of computational and graphical statistics _ , they maybe are perceived as less prestigious .    * diaconis : * another piece of advice is to read classic papers .",
    "if there s a topic that interests you , look back at what the people who invented it actually wrote .",
    "it gives you a more concrete sense of why they invented it and what it s about , compared to reading textbooks .",
    "nowadays people do nt pay enough attention to such things  instead it s `` let s try it out and write a quick paper . ''",
    "statistics is as healthy as it s ever been .",
    "one can see the prominence of machine learning , but they are really just using ideas that were developed in statistics twenty or fifty years ago .",
    "they are applying them  that s great  but we are inventing the ideas that will be applied in the next twenty or fifty years .",
