    "a @xmath1-coalescent is a stochastic model for the genealogy of a ( haploid ) population of @xmath1 individuals backward in time . in this model ,",
    "the individuals of the population are identified with the integers of the set @xmath6 , and the @xmath1-coalescent takes its values in the partitions of @xmath6 .",
    "a partition of @xmath6 is composed of a certain number of blocks , between @xmath7 and @xmath1 . the initial state of the @xmath1-coalescent is the partition in @xmath1 blocks , that is the partition in singletons , @xmath8 any particular set of @xmath9 blocks then merges independently in one block at rate given by : @xmath10 } \\lambda(dx ) x^{-2 } \\ ; x^{k } \\ ; ( 1-x)^{n - k},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a probability measure on @xmath12 $ ] . after the first coalescence",
    ", again , any particular set of @xmath9 blocks merges independently in one block at rate given by ( [ ratecoalescent0 ] ) , with @xmath1 replaced by the current numbers of blocks .",
    "the procedure is then repeated , until the process terminates at the partition in one single block , @xmath13 _ the first motivation of this paper is to study the number of blocks involved in the last coalescence . _",
    "the interpretation of the model is the following : two integers are in the same block of the partition at time @xmath14 in the @xmath1-coalescent if the corresponding individuals found their common ancestor at time @xmath15 backward in time . at the time of the last coalescence ,",
    "all the individuals found their common ancestor .    when @xmath16 , a construction of the @xmath1-coalescent is the following .",
    "we start with a poisson point measure on @xmath17,$ ] with intensity @xmath18 . to each atom @xmath19 of this random measure , we associate a random subset @xmath20 of the set of integers @xmath21 by sampling each integer independently with the same probability @xmath22 .",
    "then , the blocks with labels in @xmath23 at time @xmath24 coalesce in one block .",
    "first , among the ( possibly infinitely many ) atoms @xmath19 on a finite time interval , only a finite number give rise to an effective merge in the @xmath1-coalescent , and so we may distinguish a first coalescence , a second one , @xmath25 second , the construction requires to give labels to the blocks . while most definitions of the @xmath1-coalescent do not stress on the labelling of the blocks , the point of this paper is to emphasize a particular ordering .",
    "our choice is to label the blocks in the order of their smallest element .",
    "the @xmath1-coalescent is then described by the family @xmath26 of its ordered blocks at time @xmath15 : @xmath27 is the block containing @xmath7 , @xmath28 is the block containing the smallest integer not in @xmath27 ( if any ) @xmath25 the largest @xmath29 such that @xmath30 is non - empty is then the number of blocks in the @xmath1-coalescent , denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath32-coalescent depicted on figure [ picture00 ] , we have @xmath33 and : @xmath34    this leads to the following alternative description of the coalescent as a family of ( coalescing ) maps . for each @xmath35 , and @xmath14 , there exists a unique integer @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and we then set @xmath38 .",
    "the random map @xmath39 is non - increasing , starts at @xmath40 and terminates at @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , if two functions @xmath41 started at different points meet , then they coincide at each further time .",
    "figure [ picture00 ] describes the collection of the maps @xmath41 started at @xmath42 .",
    "notice that a function @xmath41 not only decreases when the block labelled @xmath41 takes part to a coalescence , but also when at least two blocks with lower label take part to a coalescence .    also , adding more and more functions @xmath43 starting at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath25 allows to define the @xmath1-coalescents in a coupled way , hereafter referred to as the natural coupling .",
    "this coupling allows to define the coalescent started from an infinite number of blocks , simply called the coalescent in the following , or the @xmath0-coalescent if we need to stress on the measure @xmath11 .",
    "let us argue on our first motivation : when adding more and more functions @xmath43 , the block counting process @xmath47 of the @xmath1-coalescent evolves , and we may think of it as a wave moving to the right . the motion to the right , measured by the depth @xmath48 of the @xmath1-coalescent , is either a.s",
    ". bounded , or a.s .",
    "unbounded - we come back to this fact in subsection [ sub : keylemma ] .",
    "in both cases , we investigate the question of the existence of a limiting shape ( in distribution in the second case ) for the wave viewed from the right .",
    "it amounts to study the time - reversal of the block counting process for the coalescent started from @xmath1 blocks as @xmath5 : this is a slight elaboration on our first motivation .",
    "the depth of the @xmath1-coalescent @xmath49 corresponds to the first time the @xmath1 blocks have merged in @xmath7 block . in the aforementioned natural coupling , we may consider the random subset of the integers @xmath50 that will be called the set of records : the integer @xmath1 belongs to the set of records @xmath51 when the function @xmath41 started at @xmath1 reaches @xmath7 at some later time than the functions @xmath41 started at lower values @xmath29 for @xmath52 , thus establishing a new record .",
    "see figure [ picture00 ] for an illustration . since @xmath53 by definition",
    ", we have that @xmath54 a.s . in terms of population genetics , the label of an individual corresponds to a record if its addition in the sample modifies the most recent common ancestor of the sample . _",
    "the study of the set of records is our second motivation . _",
    "the paths @xmath41 started from @xmath55 are good candidates to time - reversal as we now explain . to make this time - reversal clear , we introduce , after donnelly and kurtz @xcite , the following model , called the lookdown model .",
    "it is essentially constructed by time - reversal of the coalescent represented as a family of coalescing maps .",
    "the model consists in a family , indexed by the time @xmath14 , of countably many individuals distinguished by their levels .",
    "the level of an individual is an integer , and the individual at time @xmath15 at level @xmath56 is denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "the genealogical relationships between individuals are described as follows .",
    "we start with the same poisson point measure on @xmath17,$ ] with intensity @xmath18 .",
    "a random set @xmath58 is associated with each atom @xmath19 by sampling independently each integer with the same probability @xmath22 . to each atom @xmath59",
    "there corresponds a reproduction event and :    * for @xmath36 in @xmath23 , the individual @xmath60 is a child of the individual @xmath61 .",
    "notice that @xmath23 , and therefore the set of children , is infinite .",
    "* the other lineages are shifted upwards , keeping the order they had before the birth event : if @xmath62 , the individual @xmath63 is the ( unique ) child of the individual @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , see figure [ picture01 ] .",
    "this defines a countable infinite population .",
    "the ancestral lineage of an arbitrary individual @xmath57 is the line composed of the individuals @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the level of the ancestor of the individual @xmath57 at time @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ picture01 ] displays the collection of the ancestral lineages .",
    "the map @xmath69 has the same dynamic as the ( restriction of the ) map @xmath70 in the coalescent model .",
    "more is true : for each @xmath71 , the backward genealogy of the individuals at the @xmath1 lowest levels at time @xmath15 gives rise to a process valued in the partitions of @xmath72 : @xmath29 and @xmath36 are in the same block at time @xmath68 , @xmath73 , if the individuals @xmath57 and @xmath60 share a common ancestor at time @xmath74 .",
    "this partition valued process has the law of ( the restriction to @xmath75 $ ] ) of a @xmath1-coalescent .",
    "a key ingredient in this paper is the following quantity @xmath76 defined within the lookdown model . instead of looking to the ancestors of an individual",
    ", the definition considers its offspring .",
    "the levels of the offspring at time @xmath14 of the individual @xmath77 , that is the individual at time @xmath78 at level @xmath79 , form a subset of @xmath21 , the minimal element of which we define to be @xmath80 .",
    "if the subset of @xmath21 is empty , then we set @xmath81 see the dotted line in figure [ picture01 ] for an illustration .",
    "the shift by @xmath7 in the definition is for technical reason .",
    "a direct , equivalent , but slightly more difficult definition of @xmath76 ( at least on a picture ) is the following : the levels of the offspring at time @xmath14 of the individual @xmath82 , that is the individual at time @xmath78 at level @xmath7 , form a subset of @xmath21 , the connected component including @xmath7 we denote by @xmath83 again , we set @xmath84 in case this subset is @xmath85 .",
    "the collection of the random variables @xmath86 builds a non - decreasing process called _ the fixation line_. when the fixation line @xmath87 reaches level @xmath1 , then the whole population of individuals at level @xmath88 consists of offspring of individual @xmath82 , an event called fixation in population genetics : this explains the name fixation line .",
    "the link between the fixation line and the set of records @xmath51 is as follows : for each @xmath14 , @xmath80 belongs to the set of records @xmath51 for the coalescent describing the backward genealogy of the individuals at time @xmath15 .",
    "see figure [ picture01 ] for an example .",
    "this paper shows some applications of the fixation line .",
    "+ this is a review of the literature : the origin of the fixation line may be traced back to pfaffelhuber and wakolbinger @xcite in the kingman case @xmath89 . for general @xmath11 , it appears in labb @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the originality of the present work is to study the fixation line not for itself , but for understanding better the coalescent .",
    "the coalescent we presented is the @xmath0-coalescent , it was introduced independently by pitman @xcite and sagitov @xcite , and the research area has been surveyed in berestycki @xcite and bertoin @xcite .",
    "we find the fixation line useful in studying two random quantities defined in the coalescent : the set of records @xmath51 and the number of blocks implied in the last coalescence of the @xmath1-coalescent .",
    "the set of records seems not to have been considered in the literature until now .",
    "an integer @xmath1 is a record when the corresponding external branch in the coalescent tree has depth equal to that of the @xmath1-coalescent tree . in that sense ,",
    "our contribution may be seen as an atypical view on the intensively studied external branches , see caliebe et .",
    "@xcite , dhersin and mhle @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the numbers of blocks implied in the last coalescence , as well as the closely related hitting probabilities of the block counting processes , are quantities which relate to the coalescent tree near the root .",
    "this part of the tree is difficult to grasp from the standard construction of the coalescent .",
    "original techniques have been developed in the papers @xcite to circumvent this difficulty . among these papers , the ones with the closest objectives",

    "the article @xcite and mhle @xcite are concerned with the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent , which is the beta(@xmath4)-coalescent for @xmath90 , whereas @xcite deal with the beta(@xmath4)-coalescent for @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "we propose here a probabilistic approach based on the analysis of the fixation line .",
    "the main advantage with respect to previous methods is that it may be introduced for general @xmath0-coalescent , and conveniently specializes to the class of the beta(@xmath4)-coalescent for the whole family of parameters @xmath92 .",
    "short after the prepublication of this paper , mhle extended in @xcite the analytic method of @xcite to the beta(@xmath4)-coalescents , and obtained some of the results presented in this paper .",
    "we warmly invite the reader to consult this paper as a parallel reference .",
    "this is the organization of the paper : section [ sec1 ] contains a key lemma relating the depth of the @xmath1-coalescent to the hitting times of the fixation line , see lemma [ tau - alpha ] .",
    "also , the transition rates of the fixation line are computed in lemma [ prop : gamma ] for a general probability measure @xmath11 .",
    "they slightly differ from those of the block counting process , and they factorize in the special case of the beta(@xmath93-coalescents , as proved in lemma [ lem : factorize ] .",
    "two applications of the fixation line , associated with our two motivations , are detailed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "first , we compute in subsection [ sec21 ] the probability for an integer to be in the random set of records @xmath51 .",
    "second , we present in subsection [ sec22 ] the problem of the construction of the coalescent from the root , and propose , as a first and partial answer , to characterize the time - reversal of the block counting process .",
    "a simple observation reduces this problem to the computation of the law of the number of blocks implied in the last coalescence .",
    "our main result , theorem [ prop : conv - delta ] , is a limit theorem for the law of the number of blocks implied in the last coalescence in @xmath1-beta(@xmath94)-coalescents .",
    "our second main result , corollary [ cor : hitting ] , reformulates theorem [ prop : conv - delta ] in term of hitting probabilities of an integer @xmath36 by the block counting process .",
    "we also give the asymptotics of these hitting probabilities as @xmath95 .",
    "last , we take the opportunity to present a third , probabilistic derivation of the depth of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "we did our best to produce a paper as much self contained as possible .",
    "_ assumption _ : we will assume throughout that the probability measure @xmath11 gives no mass to the singletons @xmath78 and @xmath7 , @xmath96 the assumption on @xmath97 allows to rely on the simple graphical construction mentioned in the introduction without struggling to include binary coagulations .",
    "this being said , most of the results are still valid for a probability measure @xmath11 with an atom at @xmath78 .",
    "the assumption on @xmath98 avoids an uninteresting case .",
    "we first come back to the definition of the fixation line and generalize it slightly by allowing the fixation line to be started at an arbitrary integer .",
