    "in recent decades the combinations of observations from high redshift supernovae , cosmic microwave background radiation(cmbr ) @xcite and the galaxy redshift surveys indicate the existence of an exotic component with negative pressure dubbed dark energy .",
    "this dark energy violates strong energy condition and drives the universe accelerating at present time .",
    "riess@xcite@xcite dark energy and accelerating universe have been discussed extensively from different points of view . a natural candidate for this exotic component",
    "is the cosmological constant for which , however , there exists serious problems such as the fine tuning problem and the coincidence problem .",
    "so , inspired by inflation , a scalar field which is minimally coupled to the conventional matter has been treated as a dynamic dark energy model , called quintessence . in the quintessence model",
    "@xcite some special scalar potentials are designed to obtain track or attractor solutions in which the initial information is eliminated in the late time of the universe and so the fine tuning problem is resolved . however , in quintessence dark energy model , the equation of state is in the range @xmath2 $ ] which does not meet the observations well ; the observations favor a value which is less than @xmath3 .",
    "so another dynamic dark energy model , called phantom , @xcite was presented , though there exists a ` big rip ' @xcite problem in the phantom model .",
    "also , another consistent ( without ghosts , phantoms and big rip ) dark energy model for the super - accelerated phase @xmath4 of the cosmic expansion are presented in @xcite .    in kaluza - klein theories as well as in brane world scenarios",
    ", our @xmath0 universe is believed to be embedded in a higher - dimensional manifold . here , in this paper , we consider wesson s spacetime - matter ( stm ) theory wesson@xcite .",
    "this theory is distinguished from the classical kaluza - klein theory by that it has an noncompact fifth dimension and that it is empty viewed from @xmath1 and sourceful viewed from @xmath0 .",
    "because of this , the stm theory is also called induced matter theory and the effective @xmath0 matter is also called induced matter . that is , in stm theory , the @xmath1 manifold is ricci - flat while the @xmath0 hypersurface is curved by the @xmath0 induced matter .",
    "mathematically , this approach is supported by campbell s theorem that any analytical solution of the @xmath5-dimensional einstein equations with a source can be locally embedded in an @xmath6-dimensional ricci - flat manifold @xcite .    a class of @xmath1 cosmological solutions of the stm theory was originally given by liu and mashhoon @xcite and restudied later by liu and wesson @xcite .",
    "this class of exact solutions satisfy the @xmath1 ricci - flat equations @xmath7 and is algebraically rich because it contains two arbitrary functions of the time @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that several properties characterize these @xmath1 models : firstly , the @xmath0 induced matter could be described by a perfect fluid plus a variable cosmological ` constant ' .",
    "secondly , by properly choosing the two arbitrary functions of @xmath8 , both the matter - dominated and radiation - dominated standard frw models could be recovered . in the third ,",
    "the big bang singularity of the @xmath0 standard cosmology is replaced by a big bounce at which the size of the universe is finite , and before the bounce the universe contracts and after the bounce the universe expands .",
    "many further studies could be found in literature such as those about the embeddings of the @xmath1 bounce solutions to brane models @xcite , about the acceleration of the @xmath1 universe @xcite , and about the isometry between the @xmath1 solutions and a kind of @xmath1 topological black holes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to introduce a scalar field in the @xmath1 bounce cosmological solutions and build a @xmath1 quintessence and phantom model for dark energy . rather than assuming the scalar field",
    "@xmath9 being the kaluza - klein dilation for which @xmath9 is related to the metric component @xmath10 in an explicit form @xmath11 , we will just assume that the induced matter being composed of two components : the conventional perfect fluid and a scalar field .",
    "we will show that the @xmath0 conventional quintessence and phantom models as well as their late time attractor solutions could be recovered in the bounce solutions .",
    "the @xmath1 metric of the bounce solutions reads @xcite @xmath12 where , @xmath13 and @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath8 , @xmath17 is the @xmath18 curvature index , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "this class of solution satisfies the @xmath1 vacuum equations @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the third invariant is found to be @xmath23 which shows that @xmath20 determines the curvature of the @xmath1 manifold .",
    "so the @xmath24 manifold is curved if @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0 metric contained in the @xmath1 line element ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath26 one can use this @xmath0 metric to calculate the nonvanishing components of the @xmath0 einstein tensor , then one obtains @xmath27    generally speaking , the @xmath0 einstein tensor in ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) can define a @xmath0 effective or induced energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 via @xmath29 with @xmath30 as is done in the stm theory .",
    "note that this kind of definition for @xmath28 is not completely arbitrary ; the r.h.s . of ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] )",
    "play the role as constraints on the forms of @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "12 , this energy - momentum tensor was assumed to be a perfect fluid with density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 plus a variable cosmological term @xmath33 , and the result shows that this assumption works well . surely , this  @xmath34 could be served as a candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , nowadays more hopeful candidates for dark energy seem to be the scalar field models such as the quintessence and phantom .",
    "so , in this paper , we assume the @xmath0 induced energy - momentum tensor consisting of two parts : @xmath35 ,   \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath36 is a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor and @xmath37 a scalar field one with @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , @xmath40  is regular and it represents the quintessence model . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the scalar field has a negative dynamic energy and @xmath40 represents the phantom model .",
    "we will show in the following that this kind of assumption in ( [ 6 ] ) will work well .",
    "furthermore , we assume that each of the two components @xmath36 and @xmath40 conserves independently just as in most of the @xmath42 dark energy models .",
    "that is , we assume both the @xmath0 conservation laws @xmath43 and @xmath44 hold . we should also notice that the coordinate time @xmath8 is not the proper time in the solutions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , and , generally , one can not transform it to the proper time without changing the form of the @xmath1 metric ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , on a given hypersurface @xmath45const . , the proper time @xmath46 relates the coordinate time @xmath8 via @xmath47 .",
    "so the proper definitions for the hubble parameter @xmath48 and the deceleration parameter @xmath49 can be given as follows @xmath50 where the second equation in ( [ 2 ] ) was used .",
    "using these relations in ( [ 4])-([6 ] ) and in the conservation law @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one obtain the @xmath0 einstein equations and the equations of motion for the scalar field being : @xmath53where @xmath54are the energy density and pressure of the @xmath55 field , respectively , and the potential @xmath56 is assumed to be exponentially dependent on @xmath55 by @xmath57 .",
    "the equation - of - state parameter for the scalar field is found to be @xmath58by comparing the results in ( [ 7])-([9 ] ) with those in the standard @xmath59 theory , we find that on a given @xmath0 hypersurface one has @xmath60 and the two theories turn out to be of completely the same form .",
    "so we conclude that the @xmath0 quintessence and phantom models of dark energy are recovered in the @xmath1 big bounce model .",
    "we should also point out that the hubble parameter @xmath48 in ( [ 7 ] ) is constrained by the relation in ( h , q ) , @xmath61 .",
    "so the global evolution of the scale factor @xmath62 may differ from that in the @xmath0 conventional theory as we will see in the next section .",
    "the quintessence model with @xmath63 was discussed in a previous work @xcite . here , in this section , we will focus on the @xmath41 case , i.e. the phantom model of the dark energy .    similarly as in ref .",
    "17 , for @xmath41 we define @xmath64 and @xmath65 in a plane - autonomous system as @xmath66for a spatially flat universe(@xmath67 ) , we find that eqs .",
    "( [ 7])-(9 ) lead to the same evolution equations for @xmath64 and @xmath68 as in ref .",
    "caldwell , @xmath69 -3x-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\lambda y^{2 } \\notag , \\\\ y^{\\prime } & = & \\frac{3}{2}y\\left [ -2x^{2}+\\gamma _ { m}(1+x^{2}-y^{2})\\right ] -%",
    "\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\lambda xy   \\label{11},\\end{aligned}\\]]where a prime denotes derivative with respect to  @xmath5 with @xmath70 .",
    "define the densities@xmath71then eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) give @xmath72meanwhile , from ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , the effective equation of state for the scalar field is @xmath73@xmath74where the scalar field is represented by a fluid with a baryotropic equation of state @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a constant with @xmath77 .    as is known from ref .",
    "6 that there is a stable node in the phase plane at@xmath78at which we have@xmath79the second equation in ( [ 17 ] ) means that the universe is dominated by the scalar field alone , while the first equation in ( [ 17 ] ) gives @xmath80 which can better explain the observation for the dark energy .",
    "so the stable node in ( [ 16 ] ) represents an attractor solution which guides the late time evolution of the universe .    in the following we want to see how the phantom - dominated universe evolves in the @xmath1 bounce model and",
    "how much it differs from that in the @xmath0 standard phantom model . to see this",
    ", we should firstly know the scale factor in the @xmath0 one .",
    "note that all the equations from ( [ h , q ] ) to ( 17 ) become the same as those in the @xmath0 phantom model if @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then , by solving the last equation in ( [ 7 ] ) we obtain@xmath83where @xmath84 is a constant . for @xmath85",
    "the universe expands as @xmath8 increases .",
    "we can easily calculate the decelerating parameter @xmath49 , which is @xmath86 . as @xmath87 ,",
    "we find @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 phantom dominated universe is expanding and accelerating if @xmath85 , and will expand to infinity in a finite time @xmath84 .",
    "now let us return to the @xmath1 exact bounce solutions . substituting ( [ 16 ] ) into ( [ 10 ] ) and using the corresponding relations of @xmath89 in ( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath90 in ( [ h , q ] ) and @xmath91 , we obtain@xmath92thus we obtain@xmath93where @xmath94 is a constant .",
    "note that the scale factor @xmath62 in the exact @xmath1 solutions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) depends on two arbitrary functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we do not need @xmath96 in the following .",
    "however , one can in principle get @xmath96 solved out by substituting ( [ 20 ] ) into ( [ 2 ] ) .    using ( [ 20 ] ) in the expression of @xmath49 in ( [ h , q ] ) , we can calculate the deceleration parameter which is@xmath97thus we see that the phantom dominated universe in the @xmath1 model is accelerating with @xmath98 . here",
    "we should point out that current observation of the deceleration parameter is @xmath99 indicating @xmath100 .",
    "this seemingly contradiction between observation and the phantom dominated result ( [ 21 ] ) can be intepreted  as due to the fact that our present universe also contains roughly one - third of dark matter plus baryons which drive the universe to decelerating .    to retain the bounce , we add a new term inside the bracket of ( [ 18 ] ) and",
    "then the scale factor @xmath62 has the form@xmath101then ( [ 20 ] ) gives@xmath102here we should mention that ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) do satisfy the @xmath1 field equations ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "we find that if @xmath103 , the second term inside the brackets of ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) dominate , so we have@xmath104therefore we see that when @xmath87 we have @xmath105 and @xmath106 and the scale factor @xmath62 evolves with the same rate as in the corresponding @xmath0 case ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , from ( [ 22 ] ) one can show that there is a bounce at @xmath107 at which @xmath108 and @xmath62 reaches its minimum @xmath109 .",
    "the evolutions of the scale factor @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the spacetime - matter theory is characterized by that the @xmath0 matter could be explained as induced from a higher - dimensional ricci - flat vacuum . in particular , this induced matter is modelled by a perfect fluid as well as a cosmological term . however , in recent years , more and more researchers believe that there is a @xmath0 scalar field which played a very important role in constructing various dark energy models such as the quintessence and phantom . in this paper",
    "we suppose that this kind of scalar field is also induced from a higher - dimensional vacuum .",
    "that is , we assume the induced matter being composed of two components : the usual perfect fluid and a scalar field .",
    "then we find that the conventional quintessence and phantom models for dark energy could be recovered from the @xmath1 bouncing cosmological solutions .    by using the phase - plane analysis to study the stability of evolution of this @xmath1 cosmological models , we find that the familiar late - time attractor solution is recovered in the @xmath1 theory . as a comparison , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the two curves : one is the @xmath0 scale factor @xmath111 ( dashed line ) , another is the @xmath1 one @xmath110 ( solid line ) . from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] one can see that both @xmath111 and @xmath110 of the phantom - dominated universe will reach infinity in a finite time and the universe will undergo a big rip and will be ended at a new kind of spacetime singularity at @xmath114 at which everything will be annihilated .",
    "one also see in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] that even in the @xmath0 theory the time axis can be traced back to negative infinity . but this would not cause any problems if one simply assumes that the phantom dominated universe began at a time after the big bang as required by observation . however , we should point out that in the @xmath1 bouncing model the curve of @xmath110 may provide with not only a later - time attractor solution but also a mechanics to explain the bounce . generally speaking ,",
    "if the universe before and during the bounce was dominated by phantom , and if matter was created some time after the bounce , then the repulsive force of the phantom field can simple explain the bounce .",
