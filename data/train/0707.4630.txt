    "we study properties of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of bosons with dipolar interaction . we consider a polarized system and assume that dipolar moments are oriented perpendicularly to the 2d plane .",
    "this assures that the interaction potential @xmath0 is always repulsive and there are no instabilities caused by dipolar attraction .",
    "the following model hamiltonian is used to describe the system : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dipolar mass and @xmath3 the number of dipoles .",
    "properties of a homogeneous system are governed by one characteristic parameter , the dimensionless density @xmath4 , where the characteristic length @xmath5 is proportional to the interaction strength : @xmath6 .",
    "deeply in the dilute regime one expects that a short - range interaction potential ( like the dipolar one ) can be described by only one parameter , namely , the @xmath7-wave scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "parameters @xmath5 and @xmath8 are directly related : @xmath9 .",
    "we perform a numerical study of the ground - state properties of this system using quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "firstly , using the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method it is possible to evaluate multidimensional averages over the trial wavefunction @xmath10 . in the calculation of the energy and superfluid fraction @xmath11 ,",
    "the variational parameters in @xmath10 are chosen such that they minimize variational energy . in the calculation of the one - body density matrix",
    "we optimize parameters so that the difference between variational and mixed estimators is minimal .",
    "secondly , we use the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method based on solving schrdinger equation in imaginary time at @xmath12 .",
    "the dmc method permits to find the ground state energy @xmath13 of a bosonic system exactly ( in statistical sense ) .",
    "also superfluid density @xmath11 and local quantities ( e.g. @xmath14 , @xmath15 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) can be found in a `` pure '' ( non - depending on the choice of trial w.f . ) way .",
    "an extrapolation procedure can be used for predictions of non - local quantities ( e.g. @xmath16 , @xmath17 , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "we construct the trial wave function ( w.f . ) in the following form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are particle coordinates and @xmath20 are coordinates of triangular lattice sites .",
    "trial w.f .",
    "( [ psi ] ) is symmetric under exchange of any two particles .",
    "the two - body jastrow term @xmath21 is chosen@xcite at short distances as a solution of the 2-body scattering problem at zero energy . at large distances , the functional form of the hydrodynamic solution",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath21 accounts for pair - collisions relevant for short distances and collective behavior ( sound ) at large distances .",
    "one should note that @xmath10 is not of a nosanow - jastrow type , as by moving one particle all @xmath22 terms in the product in ( [ psi ] ) are changed , thus introducing a global change ( _ i.e. _ depending as well on coordinates of other particles ) , so that this term is not a one - body term , but rather a many - body term .",
    "another feature of this w.f .",
    "is that number of the particles @xmath3 can be different from number of lattice sites @xmath22 making it suitable for studying of a crystal with vacancies .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 describes particle localization close to lattice sites .",
    "typical dependence ( at sufficiently large density , @xmath24 ) of variational energy on parameter @xmath23 shows two minima . position of the first minimum is @xmath25 . in this case , the translational invariance is preserved and density profile is flat .",
    "this minimum corresponds to a gas / liquid state . in the second minimum @xmath23 is finite and translational invariance is broken .",
    "density profile has crystal symmetry .",
    "this minimum corresponds to a solid state .",
    "thus , with the single trial w.f .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and different variational parameters we are able to describe distinct phases .",
    "the ground state phase at small densities corresponds to a gas , solid being metastable . on the contrary , at large densities solid state is energetically preferable .",
    "the critical density of the quantum phase transition @xmath26 was obtained by constructing fits to the energy of gas and solid phases @xcite .",
    "this estimation of the critical density is in agreement with a path integral monte carlo calculation@xcite done at low finite temperature @xmath27 .",
    "green s function monte carlo calculation@xcite provided a slightly lower critical density @xmath28 but in this case a discrete model was used , and by decreasing the filling factor , a small increase in the critical value was found .",
    "[ fig1a ] shows the pair distribution function @xmath29 in the gas phase in a wide range of densities . at the largest density ( close to the phase transition )",
    "there is a well pronounced first peak followed by a number of well visible oscillations .",
    "this is a manifestation of strong correlations present in the system close to the point of a quantum phase transition .",
    "as the density is lowered the height of the peak is decreased and eventually it disappears , leading to a smooth behavior without any visible oscillations .",
    "this smooth behavior is characteristic for weakly - interacting bose systems .      in the dilute regime one",
    "expects the mean - field theory to be applicable . as was rigorously derived in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) has a coupling constant @xmath30 dependent on the density .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic dependence of the mean - field energy on the density@xcite @xmath31 it turns out that the mean - field contribution to the energy ( [ e ] ) is the only well established term .",
    "we perform a study of beyond mean - field terms .",
    "comparison to numerical results for hard - disks@xcite show that for densities @xmath32 the exact shape of the interaction potential is no longer important , and that the only relevant parameter is @xmath7-wave scattering length .",
    "the peculiarity of a two - dimensional system is that for such a small densities , @xmath33 , there is a notable difference ( of several percent ) between mf - gpe and exact result .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge there is no analytical theory , able to reproduce correctly the energy in the whole region of the universal regime .",
    "summarizing , the mean - field description has limitations ( failure ) in a two - dimensional system in the universal regime .",
    "the one - body density matrix @xmath34 in the gas phase has a finite asymptotic value , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath35 )",
    "finite asymptotic values are manifestations of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) .",
    "the asymptotic value gives the condensate fraction . in the dilute regime",
    "almost all of the particles are condensed , but increasing the density the stronger interactions deplete the condensate and condensation fraction drops down to @xmath36 close to the phase transition point .",
    "an important question is what happens to the condensate as system crystallizes .",
    "there are several definitions of a _ supersolid _",
    ":    1 .   _",
    "spatial order of a solid + finite superfluid density _ + 2 .",
    "_ spatial order of a solid ( broken - symmetry oscillations in diagonal element of obdm ) + off - diagonal long - range order in obdm _    generally , it is believed that both definitions are equivalent .",
    "reduced dimensionality increases the role of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this makes a two - dimensional crystal a good candidate for having a supersolid .",
    "notice that in a one - dimensional , system quantum fluctuations destroy crystalline long - range diagonal order .",
    "a previous study for the presence a supersolid in a two - dimensional dipolar system is not conclusive .",
    "low - temperature ( pimc ) simulation@xcite shows that gas phase is completely superfluid , while no superfluid fraction is found in crystal phase .",
    "still , the presence of ( a possible ) supersolid can be masked by much smaller critical temperature in a crystal .",
    "a zero - temperature method was used with a symmetrized trial w.f . in [ @xcite ] .",
    "no conclusions were drawn for presence / absence of a supersolid due to an unsufficient overlap of the trial w.f . with the actual ground state .",
    "[ fig2a ] shows the one - body density matrix @xmath37 in the crystal phase close to the phase transition .",
    "while energy in a crystal is not sensitive to symmetrization of the wavefunction , it is crucial to symmetrize w.f . in the calculation of @xmath37 . indeed , without symmetrization off - diagonal element @xmath37 decays exponentially fast to zero , see thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] . using symmetrized w.f .",
    "we find instead a finite asymptotic value ( of the order of @xmath38 for @xmath39 particles ) .",
    "there is a certain decay of the condensate fraction as system size increases .",
    "finite - size effects are very important in a @xmath40 dipolar system . indeed , the characteristic dependence of the energy , obdm limiting value , _ etc .",
    "_ is @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 in short - range potentials as can be seen from the tail correction of the potential energy .",
    "for this reason a proper study of the supersolid in the thermodynamic limit should be done . here , we limit ourselves to some preliminary results for a finite - size system .",
    "the superfluid fraction corresponds to the slope of the winding number ( diffusion coefficient @xmath43 of the center of masses in imaginary time @xmath44 ) .",
    "once again , symmetrization is crucial , otherwise artificial zero slope is obtained ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig2b ] ) . using properly symmetrized w.f .",
    "we find superfluid signal .",
    "the signal gets weaker as we increase number of particles @xmath3 ( see open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] ) .",
    "the trial w.f .",
    "( [ psi ] ) permits us to investigate role of vacancies .",
    "a system with @xmath45 lattice sites and @xmath46 vacancies is studied .",
    "the superfluid density experiences dramatic effects in the presence of vacancies .",
    "the signal increases from @xmath47 for 0 vacancies to @xmath48 for 2 vacancies .",
    "to summarize , the diffusion monte carlo method was used to study the properties of a dipolar 2d bose system at @xmath12 .",
    "the ground state energy , pair distribution function , one - body density matrix were calculated in a wide range of densities .",
    "the gas - solid quantum phase transition is found at density @xmath49 .",
    "limitations ( failure ) of mean - field description were pointed out in the universal low - density regime .",
    "existence of mesoscopic analogue of the off - diagonal long - range order was shown in one - body density matrix in a finite - size crystal close to phase transition .",
    "non - zero superfluid fraction was found in a finite - size crystal .",
