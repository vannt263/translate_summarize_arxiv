    "in the late nineties , a new type of solitary waves was identified and given the name of _ embedded solitons _ ( es ) . at first , es were found in nonlinear - optical models including quadratic ( @xmath0 ) nonlinearities @xcite-@xcite , and later they were discovered in hydrodynamic @xcite and liquid - crystal dynamical models rodriguez2003 .",
    "quite recently , es were found in discrete systems too , _",
    "viz_. , in a finite - difference version of a higher - order nls ( nonlinear schrdinger ) equation @xcite , and in a model of an array of linearly - coupled waveguides with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( cubic ) nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of  the _ _  _ _ es is that their internal frequencies and , in some cases , also their velocities , _ _",
    "_ _ fall in a spectral region occupied by linear wave modes , where regular solitons can not exist , as they would decay into radiation .",
    "that is , es are exceptional states that _ do not _ emit linear waves , despite being in resonance with them .",
    "a qualitative explanation to the existence of es was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and more quantitative arguments were provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a number of generic features of the es found in continuous systems have been identified . in particular , es are usually isolated solutions , although _ continuous families _ of es may exist too , under special symmetry conditions @xcite",
    ". the es may be stable against small perturbations in the linear approximation , but general arguments and direct simulations demonstrate that they are usually unstable at the second order , which is why they are often called semi - stable \" solutions .",
    "nevertheless , examples of completely stable es have been also found @xcite , and their stability has been demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "much less is known about embedded lattice solitons ( els ) in discrete systems .",
    "only a few examples of models admitting isolated nonlinearly unstable els have been found @xcite .",
    "some issues which remain to be analyzed are , for example , the possibility of the existence of _ continuous families _ of els , and to determine if they may be completely stable .",
    "furthermore , a challenging question is whether els may move across the lattice with arbitrary constant velocities .",
    "we address these issues in the present work , introducing a new nonlinear lattice model which gives rise to exact solutions for els which feature all these properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the new model and its continuous family of _ moving _ lattice solitons . in sec .",

    "motivated by the recent discoveries of continuous families of es in the complex modified korteweg - de vries ( cmkdv ) equation @xcite and in a generalized third - order nonlinear schrdinger equation yang2003 , dmitry , in the present paper we will consider a differential - difference equation of the following form:@xmath2where @xmath3 is a complex variable , the overdot stands for @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , @xmath6and @xmath7 are real constants . at fixed @xmath8 ,",

    "( [ cmkdv2 ] ) is precisely the cmkdv equation studied in @xcite .",
    "it is worth observing that the coefficient in front of the nonlinear term in the cmkdv equation may be positive or negative , depending on the physical application .",
    "for example , in the description of light propagation in liquid - crystal waveguides , this coefficient is positive @xcite . on the other hand , the derivation of the cmkdv equation for strongly dispersive waves in a weakly nonlinear medium by means of a multiple - scale expansion , presented in ref .",

    "it is necessary to take into account that the solitons defined by eqs .",
    "( [ soliton])-([q ] ) are _ moving solitons_. due to this movement , the soliton s intrinsic frequency must be compared to the linear spectrum of the phonon waves _ in the reference frame which moves along with the soliton _ (",

    "the coordinate @xmath44 is replaced by @xmath45 , thus implying that the accordingly defined frequency includes the doppler shift .",
    "additional arguments ( based on the fourier expansion of the fields ) showing that the resonance between moving solitons and linear waves must be studied in the moving reference frame were given in refs .",

    "since the intrinsic frequencies  of the soliton solutions of eq .",

    "3 contains a central component , which is essentially the fourier transform of the unperturbed soliton , and two symmetric radiation bands , approximately located at @xmath99 .",
    "these radiation bands contain all the expected resonant wavenumbers , except the value @xmath100 , which falls within the central band .",

    "( [ dde2 ] ) corresponding to an initial condition of the form ( [ ic1 ] ) with @xmath117 ( which is smaller than the amplitude of the exact soliton ) shows that the perturbed pulse emits a radiation wavetrain to the left , as seen in fig .",

    "6 , exhibits two symmetric radiation peaks at @xmath118 , which are very close to the expected values .",
    "the emission of radiation from a perturbed linearly stable els may result in its full decay , and consequently its stability ( or , better said , robustness ) must be tested in long simulations .",
    "it is relevant to mention that in the continuum limit , the es solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cmkdv2 ] ) are stable because this equation gives rise to a continuous family of es with arbitrary energy , and hence a perturbed soliton can shed off a part of its energy and settle down to an es solution with a smaller energy @xcite . in continuum models supporting isolated es ,",
    "the perturbed pulse may not be able to find a stationary soliton with a lower energy toward which it could relax , and hence it may go on radiating till complete decay .",
    "this scenario , referred to as the semi - stability \" ( alias nonlinear instability ) of the es , really occurs in the continuum model with the combined @xmath119 nonlinearity @xcite .    in the present case",
    ", the stability of the els may be secured if a perturbed soliton can find a way to relax , after shedding off some radiation , to a new stationary soliton shape . within the bounds of the exact solution family given by eqs .",
    "( [ soliton])-([q ] ) , this process does not seem plausible , as all the exact solutions have a unique value of the amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , it may happen that the exact family is only a subset of a more general manifold of soliton solutions .",
    "the possible existence of such an extended soliton family would not only provide for the stability as explained above , but it is a fundamentally important issue by itself .    to clarify the eventual fate of the perturbed solitons of eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) , we now display some typical examples . in the first place ,",
    "let us consider the double - embedded soliton corresponding to @xmath79 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as stated before , the shape of this soliton is defined by the parameters @xmath84 , @xmath122 _ _  _ _ and _ _  _ _ @xmath86 .",
    "if this soliton is perturbed by increasing its amplitude [ for instance , taking the initial condition ( ic1 ) with @xmath93 ] , the perturbed pulse starts to oscillate .",
    "in the course of the evolution , the oscillations gradually fade away due to the radiation loss , as shown by the upper curve in fig . 7 , and the perturbed soliton tends to settle down into a stationary shape , which is quite possible , as the initial perturbation increased its norm .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the height of the initial pulse is _ smaller _ than the amplitude of the exact soliton ( for example , @xmath124 ) , the norm of the perturbed pulse becomes smaller than the exact soliton s norm , and therefore the pulse will not be able to relax back to the exact soliton .",
    "as explained above , such a perturbation might lead to the destruction of the soliton , unless it can find another stationary shape to which it may relax to .",
    "the evolution of this perturbed soliton was numerically simulated , and the lower curve in fig .",
    "7 shows the behavior of the soliton s amplitude .",
    "as we can see in this figure , the perturbed soliton does not decay indefinitely .",
    "it again exhibits a damped oscillatory behavior ( although the oscillation period is much longer than in the previous case , when the perturbation increased the norm ) , and it finally approaches a new equilibrium state .",
    "the behavior exhibited in fig.7 indicates that the double - embedded lattice solitons are _ completely stable _ pulses and also , as conjectured above , that the exact solitons seem to be just a subset of a broader family of discrete solitons .",
    "the complete characterization of this broader family lies outside the scope of the present work and it will not be addressed here .    the stability of the single - embedded lattice solitons of eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) is even clearer .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the soliton corresponding to @xmath125 , @xmath105 , @xmath126 , @xmath107 , and @xmath127 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 , _ _",
    "_ _ @xmath128 _ _  _ _ and _ _  _ _ @xmath111 .",
    "as the value of the parameter @xmath28 lies outside the range of the function @xmath129 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , the soliton is indeed single - embedded ( _ i.e._,only in terms of its frequency , but not according to  its velocity ) .",
    "to perturb this soliton , we first took the initial condition ( [ ic1 ] ) with an increased amplitude , @xmath130 .",
    "this perturbed pulse stabilizes itself quite rapidly , as we can see from the time evolution of its height , which is presented in the upper curve of fig .",
    "8 . in a similar way ,",
    "if the initial amplitude is _ decreased _ to @xmath131 ( recall that the amplitude of the exact soliton is @xmath132 ) , the pulse also relaxes quickly , its height evolving as shown by the lower curve in fig .",
    "this figure indicates that the single - embedded soliton of eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) tested in these simulations is a _",
    "_  _ _ stable solution .",
    "figure 8 also shows that when the initial pulse is higher ( lower ) than the exact soliton , the amplitude of the established steady - state pulse will be still larger ( smaller ) than the amplitude @xmath133 of the exact soliton solution .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in the case of the es of eq .",
    "( [ cmkdv2 ] ) , and an explanation of this behavior ( by means of a variational analysis ) was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a comparison of figs .",
    "7 and 8 reveals an interesting difference : while the amplitude of the perturbed double - embedded soliton shown in fig .",
    "7 exhibits well - defined oscillations , the amplitude of the single - embedded soliton seen in fig .",
    "8 evolves almost monotonically .",
    "this qualitative difference may be related to the fact that the resonance condition ( [ r1 ] ) determines _ five _ resonant wavenumbers in the case studied in fig .",
    "7 , and _ only one _ in the case corresponding to fig . 8",
    "actually , a precise explanation of the different behaviors exhibited in figs . 7 and 8 remains a challenge for future work .",
    "we again stress that the perturbed lattice solitons of eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) stabilize as new stable pulses whose heights are _ different _ from the unique value of the amplitude of the exact soliton solutions given by eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) .",
    "as said above , this observation strongly suggests that the exact solutions given by eqs .",
    "( [ soliton])-([q ] ) constitute just a particular subset of a _ wider _ soliton family of the eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) , which is a subject for a separate work .",
    "our simulations , performed at many values of the parameters , have _ never _ revealed an unstable soliton , even if the initial perturbation was actually large .",
    "an additional example is displayed in fig .",
    "9 , for @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",

    "( [ ic1 ] ) with @xmath124 , which is essentially lower than the amplitude of the exact solution . in this case",
    "again , the amplitude of this perturbed pulse exhibits damped oscillations and a very clear trend to the stabilization into a new stationary soliton , which does not belong to the family of the exact solutions .      once knowing that the els of eq .",
    "( [ dde2 ] ) are stable against perturbations , it is natural to consider their robustness against collisions .",
    "to this end , we simulated collisions between two els moving in opposite directions .",
    "a typical example can be displayed for @xmath138 , @xmath105 , @xmath126 and @xmath108 . in this case",
    ", all the solitons belonging to family ( [ soliton])-([q ] ) have the same amplitude and width , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , but may differ in the velocity , which is controlled by the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we can take a soliton moving to right , with @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and a second one travelling to left , with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "initially , these solitons are placed at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "the collision between these solitons is shown in fig .",
    "10 , which demonstrates that they recover their shapes and velocities after the collision . in fig .",
    "11 , we specially display the shape of the solitons after the collision ( at @xmath147 ) .",
    "this figure shows that no radiation is emitted by the solitons after the collision , and it confirms that the solitons keep the same value of the amplitude , @xmath139 , which they had before the collision . at the moment shown ( @xmath148 ) ,",
    "the centers of the pulses are located at @xmath149 and @xmath150 . without the collision ,",
    "they would be found ( at the same moment of time ) at the points @xmath151and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that the only effect of the collision is a shift in the position of the solitons ( as occurs usually in integrable systems ) .",
    "the same result was observed in simulations performed at other values of the parameters .",
    "in this work we have introduced a new one - dimensional dynamical lattice model .",
    "the underlying equation ( [ dde2 ] ) includes next - nearest - neighbor couplings , and it may be regarded as a discretization of the complex modified kdv equation , or as an extension of the ablowitz - ladik model ( in the staggered form ) . the model may apply to the description of a bose - einstein condensate with dipole interactions between atoms , trapped in a deep optical lattice .",
    "a family of exact lattice - soliton solutions of the discrete equation was found , with the following characteristics :    \\(i ) these solitons can move with arbitrary constant velocities ( within a certain interval ) , without being hindered by the lattice discreteness . on the other hand ,",

    "\\(v ) the exact soliton solutions with the fixed amplitude constitute a subset a larger family of stable discrete moving solitons , which can be found in a numerical form . in particular , under a perturbation that reduces the soliton s norm , a perturbed soliton relaxes to a new one which belongs to the extended family .",

    "<S> it was recently proved that solitons _ embedded _ in the spectrum of linear waves may exist in discrete systems , and explicit solutions for isolated unstable embedded lattice solitons ( els ) of a differential - difference version of a higher - order nls equation were found [ physica d * 197 * ( 2004 ) 86 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of these els gives rise to relevant questions such as the following : are there _ continuous families _ of els ? , can els be _ stable _ ? </S>",
    "<S> , is it possible for els to move along the lattice ? </S>",
    "<S> , how do els interact ? . </S>",
    "<S> the present work addresses these questions by showing that a novel equation ( a discrete version of a complex modified kdv equation which includes next - nearest - neighbor couplings ) has a two - parameter continuous  family of exact els . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons can move with arbitrary velocities across the lattice , and the numerical simulations demonstrate that these els are completely stable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the numerical tests show that these els are robust enough to withstand collisions , and the result of a collision is only a shift in the positions of the solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the model may apply to the description of a bose - einstein condensate with dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms , trapped in a deep optical - lattice potential .    * in nonlinear systems where solitons can exist , the propagation of small - amplitude linear waves , which obey the linearized version of the nonlinear equations , is possible too .  </S>",
    "<S> however , for a soliton to exist , it is absolutely necessary that no resonances occur between the soliton and these linear waves . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the soliton would decay due to an energy transfer towards the linear waves . based on this no - resonance argument </S>",
    "<S> , it was frequently assumed that the solitons internal frequencies could not be contained in the linear spectrum of the system , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e_. , they could not lie within the band of frequencies permitted to linear waves . however , at the end of the nineties exceptions to this rule were found , and a special type of solitons were discovered , which do not resonate with linear waves , in spite of having frequencies immersed in the spectrum of these waves . in 1999 these peculiar solitary waves were given the name of _ embedded solitons _ * * ( es ) , and * * in the following years a number of models supporting es were identified . </S>",
    "<S> most of these models describe continuous systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , some examples of discrete es were recently found too . these _ embedded lattice solitons _ ( els ) </S>",
    "<S> are isolated solutions which are stable against small perturbations in the linear approximation , but are nonlinearly unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of these isolated unstable els triggered the search for models admitting _ continuous families _ of _ stable _ els . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel differential - difference equation which has a two - parameter _ continuous family _ of exact els . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons can move with arbitrary velocities across the lattice , and the numerical simulations show that they are _ completely stable _ solutions . * </S>"
