    "the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission ( dge ) is produced by cosmic - ray ( cr ) particles interacting with the gas and radiation fields in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . as has been recognised since the late 1950s @xcite",
    ", measurements of the dge can be used to study cr origin and propagation in the galaxy , and also to probe the content of the ism itself , independent of other methods .",
    "they are complementary to direct measurements of crs by balloons and satellites , and to radio astronomical surveys of synchrotron radiation that is produced by cr electrons and positrons losing energy in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the first @xmath0-ray observations made by the oso-3 satellite @xcite showed emission in the inner galaxy .",
    "the breakthrough came with the sas-2 @xcite and cos - b @xcite instruments , whose galactic plane surveys above 100  mev allowed testing of dge models based on crs and their interactions in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the comptel and egret instruments on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ provided higher - quality data covering the entire sky in the energy range 1  mev to 10  gev , which stimulated more detailed modelling .",
    "recently , the spi instrument on the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) _ observatory has extended the observations of cr - induced diffuse emissions into the hard x - ray range @xcite , while ground - based instruments @xcite have detected emission at tev energies from the galactic plane and galactic centre regions that are likely to have a cr - induced origin . for a recent pre_fermi _ review of the subject see @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( _ fermi_lat ) provides a view of the entire @xmath0-ray sky from 30 mev to beyond several hundred gev with a sensitivity surpassing its predecessor instrument , egret , by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "studies of the dge by the _",
    "fermi_latcollaboration have so far concentrated on specific regions of the sky . at intermediate galactic latitudes , _",
    "fermi_lat observations did not confirm the egret `` gev excess '' and showed that the spectrum was consistent with a dge model based on measured cr spectra @xcite .",
    "the emissivity of nearby h  i gas was derived from analysis of a selected high - latitude region @xcite and found to agree with the emissivity calculated assuming measured cr spectra .",
    "analysis of data for the 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath5 galactic quadrants @xcite showed a higher - than - expected h  i emissivity in the outer galaxy with respect to the dge model used by @xcite .",
    "these studies of the outer galaxy also indicated a lower @xmath2-factor ( the ratio between integrated co - line intensity and h@xmath3 column density ) compared to that used by @xcite .",
    "the early studies with the _",
    "fermi_lat data have systematically moved from understanding the dge produced by crs interacting with the relatively nearby ism to progressively larger regions of the galaxy .",
    "modelling the dge requires knowledge of cr intensities and spectra , along with the distributions of interstellar gas and radiation fields , throughout the galaxy . starting from the distribution of cr sources and the injection spectra of crs , the cr intensities and spectra",
    "can be estimated by modelling their propagation in the galaxy , taking into account relevant energy losses and gains .",
    "the resulting cr distributions are then folded with the target distributions of the interstellar gas and radiation fields to calculate the dge .",
    "defining the input distributions and calculating the models is not a trivial task and involves analysis of data from a broad range of astronomical and astroparticle observatories .",
    "cosmic - ray propagation models can be constrained to a certain extent using measurements of crs in the solar system ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . for an assumed propagation model , e.g. , plain diffusion , diffusive - reacceleration , diffusion - convection , etc . , the propagation parameters of the model and size of the cr confinement region can be derived by comparing the modelled secondary - to - primary cr nuclei ratios with data . however , some key components are difficult to constrain with this method .",
    "an example is the cr source distribution because the cr data essentially probe only relatively nearby sources , and not the galaxy - wide distribution .",
    "because @xmath0-rays are undeflected by magnetic fields and absorption in the ism is negligible below @xmath6 tev @xcite , the dge is a direct probe of the cr intensities and spectra in distant locations , allowing the study of the galactic distribution of cr sources .    in this paper , we analyse the dge from the full sky observed with the _ fermi_lat .",
    "we use data from the first 21 months of observations with _ fermi_lat for energies 200 mev to 100 gev that contain the lowest fraction of background events in the _",
    "fermi_lat data .",
    "the dge is modelled using the code ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we create a grid of dge models by varying the cr source distribution , the cr halo size , and the distribution of interstellar gas .",
    "the models are constrained to reproduce directly measured cr data , and then compared to the @xmath0-ray data using an iterative maximum - likelihood fitting procedure .",
    "our fits allow for variations in the @xmath2factor , the fluxes and spectra of the point sources in the first _",
    "fermi_lat   catalogue ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the intensity and spectrum of an isotropic @xmath0-ray background component , and scaling of the optical and infrared component of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "we compare the likelihood of the models , and match observed and predicted intensities and spectra for various regions of the sky .",
    "maps of the residual @xmath0-ray emissions after subtraction of the dge models are presented with the discussion of possible interpretations .",
    "our study is necessarily limited due to the ( potentially ) large number of dge model parameters .",
    "only diffusive - reacceleration models are considered for the cr propagation , even though models with convection and even plain diffusion models can in some cases provide an equivalent fit to the cr data  @xcite .",
    "we assume a smooth distribution of cr sources with homogeneous injection spectra , although we expect crs to originate in discrete sources and show variability in their emission spectra @xcite .",
    "because the homogeneity assumption tends to mainly affect the cr electrons , this is a very good approximation for the source distributions of the cr nuclei producing the bulk of the dge in the energy range considered in this paper .",
    "our propagation and emissivity calculations are limited to two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "depending on the correlation of cr sources and gas densities , three - dimensional ( 3d ) calculations taking the spiral arm structure of the galaxy into account might quantitatively change the results of the paper even though the azimuthal averaged distributions are not changed .",
    "our qualitative conclusions are , however , independent of these assumptions .",
    "the intent of this paper is not to find the perfect dge model , but rather to test a selection of astrophysically motivated models and their compatibility with @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "an essential aspect of this study is also assessing the impact of uncertainties involved in the many astrophysical inputs needed for a proper calculation of the dge .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the earlier mentioned analyses by the _",
    "fermi_lat collaboration that have used different methods to this paper .",
    "the _ fermi_lat instrument , event reconstruction , and response are described by @xcite . in this paper , we use the pass 6 dataclean event selection and instrument response functions ( irfs ) employed in @xcite to derive the isotropic @xmath0-ray intensity and spectrum . the dataclean event selection is used for our analysis because of the greatly reduced cr background , particularly in the 10100 gev energy range , compared to the standard low - background diffuse class event selection @xcite .",
    "the slight reduction in effective area compared to the diffuse class irfs is not a limitation for this analysis because the data are not limited by counting statistics for energies @xmath7 gev .",
    "the reduced cr background is especially important at high latitudes where the @xmath0-ray signal is weakest . for the description of the procedure to select this data and generate the irfs",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "note , that we restrict the upper energy range of our analysis to 100  gev because the cr background for the dataclean event selection is determined only up to this energy .",
    "we use 21 months of data , starting from 2008 august 5 to 2010 may 4 . to minimise the contribution from the very bright earth limb ,",
    "we apply a maximum zenith angle cut of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we also limit our data set to include only photons with an incidence angle from the instrument @xmath9-axis of @xmath10 .",
    "the rejection power for crs is reduced at large incident angles and the fraction of events converting in the thick tracker layers increases causing the effective psf to worsen significantly @xcite .",
    "the signal loss is minimal because the effective area for @xmath0-rays is reduced significantly at high incidence angles .",
    "exposure maps and the point spread function ( psf ) for the pointing history of the observations were generated using the standard _",
    "fermi_lat sciencetools package available from the _ fermi _ science support center .",
    "we use the _ gardian _ package ( see appendix  [ appendix : gardian ] for a description ) to process the data and exposure maps to produce all - sky intensity maps , and the same package for the maximum - likelihood fitting procedure .",
    "the counts are spatially binned with a healpix order-7 isopixelisation scheme giving an angular resolution @xmath11 @xcite . for the fitting procedure ,",
    "the data are binned with 9 equally - spaced logarithmic bins between 200 mev and 100 gev .",
    "this relatively coarse energy binning is used to ensure stable fits for the point sources that have a free scaling parameter for each energy bin .",
    "the intensity maps are created by dividing the counts map with the exposure that is weighted using a dge model .",
    "the model weighting of the exposure is required because of the strong energy dependence of the exposure at energies below @xmath12  gev @xcite . however",
    ", this causes insignificant variations between the intensities for the different dge models considered in this paper due to the similarity of their spectra .",
    "note , for our plots of the intensities for the dge models and data , we use 15 equally - spaced logarithmic energy bins for the same energy range to better utilise the energy resolution of the _ fermi_latinstrument .    when comparing the data and models we perform the maximum likelihood fit in photon space , forward folding the models to create the expected counts , using the exposure maps and psf as described in appendix  [ appendix : gardian ] .",
    "to ensure we properly take the psf into account for the spectra and longitude / latitude profiles , we calculate the model intensity maps from their expected counts in the same way as the intensity maps of the observed counts .",
    "this ensures that the comparison of intensity and photon counts is consistent .",
    "when selecting special regions of the sky , all pixels whose centres are within the region are used .",
    "because the pixel size is significantly smaller than these regions the edge effects are minimal .",
    "the systematic error in the effective area of the _ fermi_lat is estimated to be 10% below 100  mev , 5% at 562  mev , and 20% above 10  gev with linear interpolation in logarithm of energy between the values @xcite .",
    "the systematic error is not taken into account in the parameter estimates but is included in the figures below which compare the spectra and profiles of the models to the data .    the selection corresponding to the pass 7 data used for the second _ fermi_lat source catalogue ( 2fgl ) @xcite was not available at the start of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "the effect of the improved irfs in the several - gev energy range was tested by repeating the last step of the analysis for a single model using the pass 7 clean photon class .",
    "the data was prepared in the same way as the pass 6 dataclean photons described above .",
    "the results of the test are described in section  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "we use a `` conventional '' cr propagation model paradigm where a set of cr propagation models is created that reproduce locally measured cr intensities and spectra .",
    "all of the models investigated in this paper are based on , and constrained by , a variety of non-@xmath0-ray data : crs measured near the earth , the distribution of potential cr sources in the galaxy derived from observations , and the distributions of interstellar gas and radiation fields from survey data and modelling .",
    "we summarise these details below .",
    "we use the recently released version  54 ( v54 ) of the code @xcite to create models of the dge .",
    "we limit ourselves to models using diffusive reacceleration with no convection for a kolmogorov spectrum of interstellar turbulence as has been successfully used to explain cr data and the egret @xmath0-ray - sky @xcite as well as integral data @xcite . for a detailed description of the code and the improvements in v54 with respect to earlier versions",
    "we refer the reader to the dedicated website .",
    "the parameter files of the models used in this paper are available in the supplementary material to this paper .",
    "these give a precise definition of the models used which can be reproduced as required .",
    "note that only one scaling factor for the isrf is given in each file which is the average of the local and inner scaling factors found from the fit ( see section  [ sec : isrf ] and section  [ sec : regions ] ) .",
    "the collection of models used in this analysis is created using the cr source distributions and propagation parameters as described in section  [ sec : crs ] for different sizes for the cr confinement region : for an assumed cylindrical geometry where the sun is located in the galactic plane 8.5  kpc from the galactic centre , we use radial boundaries , @xmath13 , of 20  kpc and 30  kpc , and vertical boundaries ( halo size ) , @xmath14 , of @xmath15 and 10  kpc , respectively .",
    "in addition , we use two assumptions for the optical depth correction of the h  i component ( see section  [ sec : hi ] ) and also two values for the cut at which dust emission is no longer used to correct the total column density ( see section  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "this results in a total of 128 models .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the principal sources of crs . however , their galactic distribution is not well determined @xcite",
    ". therefore we consider , in addition to the measured snr distribution from @xcite ( hereafter snr distribution ) , other tracers of supernovae explosions .",
    "the pulsar distribution is a prime candidate as a proxy distribution , because pulsars are a sn explosion end state .",
    "the distribution of pulsars is also better determined than snrs .",
    "still , it suffers from observational biases and for that reason we test two different pulsar distributions , one from ( hereafter , yusifov distribution ) and another from @xcite ( hereafter , lorimer distribution ) .",
    "one of the main differences between the two distributions is the functional form used to fit the observational points .",
    "both have a maximum between @xmath16 and @xmath17 and fall off exponentially in the outer galaxy .",
    "however , @xcite force the source spatial distribution to zero at @xmath16 , whereas it is non - zero in . as an additional proxy for the distribution of cr sources , we consider the distribution of ob stars from ( hereafter , ob stars distribution ) .",
    "ob associations are putative cr acceleration regions and these stars are also the progenitors of core collapse supernovae that can leave compact objects , such as pulsars .",
    "the four cr source distributions used in this paper are plotted in figure  [ fig : crsources ] .    to determine the cr injection spectra and propagation parameters we perform a @xmath18 fit to cr nuclei , electron , and positron data , using the minuit2 minimiser . to reduce computation time ,",
    "the fit is done in two parts .",
    "the propagation parameters and cr nuclei injection spectrum is found from a fit to the cr nuclei data first . the electron injection spectrum",
    "is then found by fitting to the total cr electron and positron spectrum , including the contribution by secondary electrons and positrons from cr protons and he interacting with the interstellar gas . fitting the propagation parameters in the first step decreases the computation time because nuclei up to @xmath19si must be included in the propagation calculation for an accurate b / c ratio determination , while for the secondary electrons and positrons only protons and he are important . not calculating the secondary electrons and positrons in the fit to the propagation parameters",
    "also saves a considerable amount of time .",
    "we use the cr database created by @xcite and use the datasets and parameters as discussed below . when comparing the models to the cr data we account for solar modulation using the force - field approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the propagation parameters , the modulation potential for each experiment that has data below a few gev ( ams , bess , and ace ) is a free parameter during the fit .",
    "for the _ fermi_lat and heao3 we fixed the modulation at 300  mev and 600  mev , respectively , appropriate for the low solar activity during observations by each instrument as observed with the ace satellite @xcite .",
    "solar modulation is unimportant for jacee data .",
    "we assume that the injection spectra for all cr nuclei species are described by the same rigidity - dependent function    @xmath20    where the indices and break rigidities are obtained by tuning the model to the observed spectrum of cr protons as well as the he , c , and o nuclei spectra . the low - energy intensity and spectrum is affected by solar modulation so we use data taken at low periods in the solar activity cycle .",
    "the inclusion of nuclei up to o is to ensure the major contributor species to the production of the secondaries b and be are properly included . for the proton and he spectra we use low - energy data from bess @xcite and high - energy data from jacee @xcite . for the c and o spectra",
    "we use low - energy data from ace @xcite and high - energy data from heao3 . to determine the diffusion coefficient , @xmath21 , and alfvn speed , @xmath22 , for an assumed halo size",
    ", we use the b / c ratio because it is the most accurately observed secondary - to - primary ratio . low - energy ace @xcite and",
    "high - energy heao3 data are used for this ratio .    the break in the cr proton and he spectrum observed by atic-2 , cream , and pamela @xcite",
    "is not taken into account in this modelling and neither are the different spectral indices for protons and he .",
    "@xcite explore different scenarios for the break and different indices and find that the @xmath0-ray intensities and spectra for their models are smaller than the systematic uncertainty of the _ fermi_lat effective area .",
    "because we derive constraints on the halo size from the @xmath0-ray data , the radioactive secondary ratios are not directly used to fix the propagation conditions , as is usually the case in propagation model studies . however , the models are compared to the @xmath23be/@xmath24be ratio to check the consistency of the constraints derived from the @xmath0-rays .",
    "the @xmath23be/@xmath24be data uncertainties are large enough to allow a halo size range from 4 kpc to 10 kpc @xcite , depending on the assumed propagation model .",
    "we keep the source abundances of nuclei fixed to values determined for ace data @xcite .",
    "we assume the injection spectrum of primary cr electrons is described by the rigidity - dependent function    @xmath25    and use data from ams @xcite , _",
    "fermi_lat @xcite and _ h.e.s.s . _ to determine the spectral indices and break rigidities .",
    "unfortunately , the data are insufficient to constrain the entire parameter set and unphysical values are obtained if all are freely fit .",
    "we therefore fix the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , allowing only for freedom in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 used in this paper is consistent with that employed by @xcite for modelling the galactic synchrotron emission , while the exact value of the high - energy index does not significantly affect our results .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath31 and the modulation potential for the ams data in the fits .",
    "we therefore caution that the derived values for the modulation potential are biased , although they are in reasonable agreement with the values derived by ace for the same period @xcite .",
    "the primary electron injection spectrum is dependent on that obtained from the cr nuclei fits through the size of the confinement volume and corresponding propagation parameters , as well as the contribution of secondary cr electrons and positrons produced by the cr nuclei interacting with the interstellar gas .",
    "the overall fit is made to the data as described above .",
    "the normalisation is essentially determined from the _ fermi_lat total electron and positron data .",
    "no attempt is made to fit the increasing positron fraction reported by @xcite .",
    "these can be neglected because the contribution from the excess positrons at high energies to the @xmath0-ray emission is small .",
    "the dge in the energy range considered in this paper has a strong contribution from @xmath32-decay emission .",
    "the treatment in is described in detail by @xcite . for proton - proton interactions we use the formulation described in @xcite for the calculation of the production cross sections .",
    "the production of pions from interactions of he nuclei with the interstellar hydrogen , as well as from collisions of crs with interstellar he , are explicitly included , where we assume in this paper an interstellar he / h ratio of 0.11 by number @xcite .",
    "this is slightly higher than the canonical value of 0.1 found by observations of h  ii regions @xcite , but is within systematic uncertainty of those observations .",
    "we also ignore production of pions from cr and interstellar gas nuclei heavier than he while their contribution could be as high as @xmath3310% @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the distribution of interstellar he follows that of interstellar hydrogen , detailed below .",
    "the atomic hydrogen ( h  i ) is the most massive component of the ism and has a large filling factor , being observed in all directions .",
    "a recent comprehensive review of the h  i content of the galaxy can be found in .",
    "for the cr propagation , the code uses a 2d analytical gas model for the h  i distribution  @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution is taken from @xcite while the vertical distribution is from @xcite for @xmath34 and @xcite for @xmath35 with linear interpolation between the two ranges .",
    "for the evaluation of the diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity , the spatial structure of the gas is essential and we renormalise the column densities of the analytical gas model with those found from the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) 21-cm h  i line survey of . using the distance information derived from the radial velocity of the gas and the galactic rotation curve of @xcite",
    ", we assign the gas to galactocentric annuli , generating column density maps for each annulus ( see appendix  [ appendix : gasrings ] for a detailed description of the procedure and table  [ tab : annuliboundaries ] for annuli boundaries used in this analysis . ) .    the main uncertainty when deriving h  i column densities , n(h  i ) , from 21-cm h  i line surveys is the assumed spin temperature @xmath36 used to correct for the opacity of the 21-cm line ( see appendix  [ appendix : gasrings ] for the definition of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the value @xmath36 = 125  k has been almost universally adopted in previous @xmath0-ray studies but the quality of the _",
    "fermi_lat data require that this assumption be critically examined .",
    "h  i in the ism exists in a mixture of phases , with @xmath36 ranging from 40  k to a few thousand  k. a recent study using h  i absorption in the outer galaxy @xcite suggests that @xmath37% is in the cold ( 4060  k ) phase , while @xmath38% is in the warm phase , resulting in an average @xmath36 value in the range 250400  k. to limit the scope of the present paper , we gauge the uncertainty of the assumed @xmath36 value by using results for @xmath36 = 150  k and the optically thin assumption , which is suitable for a @xmath36 many times larger than the observed brightness temperature of the 21-cm spectral line .",
    "these two values should encompass the real @xmath36 value for most of the sky .",
    "our choice of @xmath39  k over 125  k is motivated by the fact that the maximum observed brightness temperature in the lab survey is around 150  k and @xmath36 must be greater than the observed brightness temperature .",
    "note that we are not trying to determine the value of @xmath36 from the @xmath0-ray data , only probing the uncertainty associated with using a single @xmath36 value over the entire sky .",
    "due to the nonlinearity of the optical depth correction , no attempt is made to correct the analytical model of the h  i distribution used in the  code , which assumes @xmath40  k. because we renormalise the analytical gas model when generating the @xmath0-ray sky maps , the uncertainty associated with this inconsistency is minor and mostly affects the cr propagation parameters .    for a large region of the sky , n(h  i ) is replaced by the dust - reddening corrected column density .",
    "( the region depends on the actual magnitude cut used , see section  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "changing @xmath36 affects the inferred dust - to - gas ratio and hence the column density estimate from dust - reddening .",
    "because the latter replaces that of co and h  i combined ( see section  [ sec : dust ] ) , the @xmath36 value has an effect only through the gas - to - dust ratio in this region .",
    "in addition , there is a small secondary effect caused by a slightly different distribution of n(h  i ) that is used to distribute the dust - reddening correction . for these reasons",
    "the assumed @xmath36 value should be interpreted with care .",
    "the molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) has less mass overall than the h  i but is concentrated in massive cloud complexes with large column densities . for typical cold interstellar conditions",
    "it can not be directly observed in emission .",
    "instead , the 2.6  mm line of the @xmath41co molecular @xmath42 transition is used as a tracer of h@xmath3 , assuming a proportionality between the integrated line intensity of co , w(co ) , and the column density of h@xmath3 , n(h@xmath3 ) , given by the factor @xmath2 . for the cr propagation , the code uses a 2d analytical gas model for the co distribution .",
    "the model described in  @xcite uses the gas distribution from @xcite for @xmath43 , and that from @xcite for @xmath35 , and is augmented with the model for @xmath44 .",
    "we use the 2.6  mm co - line survey of @xcite for the spatial structure of the gas . to reduce noise",
    "the data has been filtered with the moment masking technique @xcite .",
    "this technique uses a smooth version of the map to create a mask selecting regions of the sky that have a large signal - to - noise ratio . this way the noise",
    "is reduced but the resolution of the original survey is preserved . as with h",
    "i , we use the distance information from the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity together with a rotation curve to assign the gas to galactocentric annuli .",
    "these are used for the evaluation of the diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity where the spatial structure of the gas is essential , and we renormalise the column densities of the analytical gas model using survey data .",
    "the @xmath2 factor may change with galactocentric radius .",
    "however , the spatial distribution is not well known and therefore we allow it to vary in this analysis .",
    "this is done using the galactocentric annuli output from , where each w(co ) annulus ( see table  [ tab : annuliboundaries ] ) can be scaled freely in the fit . to decrease cross correlation in the derived @xmath2 values",
    ", we reduce the number of scaled annuli in the fit to 7 , putting annular boundaries at 0 , 1.5 kpc , 3.5 kpc , 5.5 kpc , 8 kpc , 10 kpc , 16.5 kpc , and 50 kpc .",
    "ionised hydrogen ( h  ii ) , although averaging only a few percent of the density of the neutral gas , contributes significantly to the @xmath0-ray emission at high latitudes because of its extended spatial distribution . the extended warm ionised medium ( wim )",
    "is probed using pulsar dispersion measures .",
    "the most widely used model for the distribution of the wim is ne2001 @xcite , but this model has been updated by @xcite to agree with more extensive pulsar data , where now the wim distribution has a larger scale - height perpendicular to the galactic plane : 2  kpc instead of 1  kpc in ne2001 .",
    "therefore , we use the wim @xmath9-distribution given by @xcite .",
    "the narrow plane component provides a small contribution to the overall emission , but is included in our modelling using a simplified form based on ne2001 .      the use of dust as a tracer of gas for @xmath0-ray studies goes back to and .",
    "infrared emission from cold interstellar dust is an alternative to surveys of h  i and co emission lines , which may not trace all of the neutral gas due to various reasons ( cold / optically thick h  i , variations in @xmath2 , h@xmath3 not traced by co ) .",
    "an extensive study of this topic with application to egret data has been performed by @xcite , where the total hydrogen column density was derived for each pixel using the _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ reddening maps given by @xcite .",
    "this procedure significantly reduced the residual in the dge modelling of egret data @xcite .",
    "the addition of dust as a tracer of gas has also been used successfully in analysis of _",
    "fermi_lat data @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we apply a similar procedure as @xcite and create a map of `` excess '' dust column density , _ e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 .",
    "we obtain a gas - to - dust ratio for both h  i and co using a linear fit of the n(h  i ) map and w(co ) map to the _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ reddening map of @xcite . for simplicity , we assume a constant gas - to - dust ratio throughout the galaxy . to minimise errors in the fitting , we first determine the gas - to - dust ratio for h  i ( h  i ratio ) in regions where no co is observed and then use that to determine the gas - to - dust ratio for co ( co ratio ) in regions rich in co. because the quantity of dust traced by _",

    "our derived ratios are given in table  [ tab : gas - to - dustratio ] .",

    ", we use the h  i gas - to - dust ratio to turn _",
    "e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 into a column density map , n(_e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 ) .",
    "this should not cause a significant systematic effect because the @xmath2values in table  [ tab : gas - to - dustratio ] are similar to those found from the @xmath0-ray fits ( see section  [ sec : xco ] ) .",
    "but , the dust reddening map does not contain distance information . because the gas - related @xmath0-ray emissivity varies throughout the galaxy , and depends on the incident cr intensity together with the gas density , correct placement of the residual gas that is traced by",
    "the reddening map is essential .",
    "while the _ e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 map corrects for uncertainties in n(h  i ) and w(co ) and its density distribution along each los should be similar to n(h  i ) and w(co ) , unique assignment from dust to n(h  i ) or n(h@xmath3 ) is not possible .",
    "it is difficult to use the density distribution of w(co ) for this placement for two reasons : the sky coverage of w(co ) is smaller than _ e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 , and the @xmath2 factor is susceptible to variations .",
    "i ) is not limited in these ways .",
    "therefore , we choose to distribute n(_e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 ) proportionally to the density distribution of n(h  i ) along each los .",
    "n(h  i ) in the optically thin limit provides a robust lower limit on the h  i column density . to account for spurious negative residuals in the reddening map we limit the residual such that the sum of _ e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 and the equivalent reddening of n(h  i ) and w(co ) is never less than the equivalent reddening of n(h  i ) in the optically thin limit the equivalent reddening of w(co ) and n(h  i )",
    "is evaluated using the determined gas - to - dust ratios , implicitly using the @xmath2 ratio given in table  [ tab : gas - to - dustratio ] .",
    "w(co ) is included in the sum to account for possible variations in the @xmath2 ratio in the galaxy , i.e. , n(h  i)@xmath45n(_e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 ) might be less than n(h  i ) in the optically thin limit because we overestimate @xmath2 .",
    "we further limit the absolute value of the negative residuals to be less than the h  i column density for each los so no pixels in the reddening corrected annular column density maps are negative .",
    "this last requirement is needed because our method for calculating the expected model counts assumes no negative pixels .",
    "the numbers of pixels affected by these two cuts is a small fraction of the total and does not affect our results significantly .    note",
    "that this method effectively replaces the n(h  i ) estimate with n(h  i)+n(_e(b@xmath45v)_@xmath46 ) in the regions not affected by the _ e(b@xmath45v)_magnitude cut ( see figure  [ fig : magnitudecutfilter ] ) . as described earlier , this changes the meaning of @xmath36 because it now acts only as a proxy for the gas - to - dust ratio for a large part of the sky .",
    "the galactic isrf is the result of emission by stars , and the scattering , absorption , and re - emission of absorbed starlight by dust in the ism .",
    "because the ism is not optically thin for the stellar emission due to the interstellar dust , a radiation transport code must be used to model the distribution of low - energy photons throughout the galaxy .",
    "we calculate the isrf using the _ frankie _ code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see appendix  [ appendix : isrf ] for more details ) .",
    "the isrf model we use in this paper ( the  maximum metallicity gradient  model from * ? ? ?",

    "this is distributed across the stellar components boxy bulge / thin disc / thick disc / halo with fractions @xmath330.1/0.7/0.1/0.1 .",
    "approximately 20% of the input stellar luminosity is reprocessed by dust and emitted in the infrared .",
    "a major uncertainty with the isrf model is the overall input stellar luminosity and how it is distributed amongst the components of the model .",
    "higher input stellar luminosities for a particular component , e.g. , the bulge , will increase the cr electron / positron losses via ic scattering and hence the overall output in @xmath0-rays approximately over the spatial region where the stellar model component dominates .",
    "estimates available in the literature illustrating the range for the total galactic stellar luminosity are , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 @xmath50 @xcite , with different distributions of the total luminosity across the stellar components used in the models of these authors .",
    "also , the metallicity gradient is important for determining the distribution of interstellar dust ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the variation due to the range of galactic metallicity gradients ) .",
    "because of these details , the uncertainty in the isrf can be considerable in regions like the inner galaxy .",
    "a full exploration of the model parameters for the isrf is beyond the scope of the current work , so we account for the uncertainty in the isrf by allowing freedom in the ic emission associated with the optical and infrared ( ir ) components .",
    "this is done by separately calculating with the contributions to the ic intensity by optical , ir , and cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "because the optical and ir are physically related , we use a common scaling parameter for both components .",
    "once the parameters of the propagation model have been determined , the predicted @xmath0-ray maps are compared to the _",
    "fermi_lat data .",
    "the comparison is non - trivial due to the uncertainties in some of the dge parameters described above , along with other @xmath0-ray sources emitting in the _",

    "@xmath0-ray point sources in the galactic plane and those outside of the galactic plane , even down to the formal @xmath53 criterion , are relatively unaffected by changes in the assumed dge model . however , there is some dependence on the dge model for lower significance point sources in the galactic plane , with the strongest effect at low energies . the relatively wide _",
    "fermi_lat   psf combines with the spatial and spectral structure of the dge for our models in the vicinity of sources in the plane , which can give considerable variations in the fluxes and spectra even for detected point sources significantly above the formal detection threshold .",
    "the time range used in this analysis is also different from that used for the 1fgl analysis , consequently the average spectra of variable sources might be different for the data set used in this paper .",
    "therefore , we use the spectral information given in the 1fgl catalogue only for the initial prescription in the fit . then , the flux of each point source in the list is determined for every energy bin independently .",
    "because a simultaneous fit is very computer intensive , we use an iterative method , fitting point sources 100 at a time starting with the brightest . at each step , the fluxes and spectra of sources that have not been fitted are included but fixed at the 1fgl catalogue values . however , our method has been shown to give results compatible with the 1fgl catalogue when the data selection and background model are the same .",
    "fermi_lat data have a residual instrumental background ( rib ) due to cr interactions in the instrument and spacecraft and also cr events misclassified as photons .",
    "the cr background depends on geomagnetic latitude , but is considered isotropic in this paper because we average over many orbits . the extragalactic diffuse @xmath0-ray background ( egb ) , assumed to be isotropic , is also present .",
    "these must be taken into account when comparing any astrophysical model with data .",
    "for a recent determination of the egb and rib components by the _ fermi_lat team see @xcite .",
    "as is shown by @xcite , the measured spectrum of the egb is dependent on the assumed foreground dge model , while the rib is determined from the instrument monte carlo modelling .",
    "however , for the present work the distinction between egb and rib is not important .",
    "we therefore determine the total `` isotropic '' background for each model where the flux in each energy bin is fitted independently .",
    "the results for the combined egb + rib obtained for each model are compared to the total of these components derived by @xcite as a consistency check .",
    "figure  [ fig : corings ] shows the co annuli used in this analysis .",
    "there is very little co emission in the outer galaxy . to minimise the effects that the bright and complex inner galaxy has on the determination of the co scaling parameters in the outer galaxy , we split the maximum likelihood fit into regions , separating the inner and outer galaxy .",
    "in addition , we also minimise the effect of the bright galactic plane when determining the isotropic background by fitting low and high - latitude regions separately .",
    "this subdivision results in 3 regions : @xmath54 ( local ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( outer galaxy ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( inner galaxy ) .",
    "a latitude cut of @xmath59 was chosen because all co with @xmath60 is considered to be in the local annulus , with the extra @xmath61 accounting for the extension of the _ fermi_lat psf , and also to reduce effects of the bright plane for the determination of the isotropic spectrum .",
    "we first fit in the local region and determine the scaling parameter for the local co annulus ( 8 kpc  10 kpc ) and the spectrum of the isotropic emission .",
    "we also allow freedom in the isrf scaling parameter because there is significant ic emission in this region , a fraction of which originates in the inner galaxy where the isrf is most uncertain .",
    "these parameters are then fixed and the fit is performed for the outer galaxy region to determine the co scaling parameters there .",
    "finally , we fit the remaining co scaling parameters in the inner galaxy region and allow the isrf scaling parameter to be free in the fit because the fraction of ic emission originating from the inner galaxy is much higher in this region than the local region .",
    "the fluxes and spectra of point sources in each region are fit as described above .    to account for the overlap between regions caused by the _ fermi_lat psf we create a model of the whole sky for each fit , setting non - fitted scaling parameters to their nominal values of 1 and the spectra of the point sources to their values in the 1fgl catalogue .",
    "this does not affect our results significantly , because the overlapping area is a small fraction of the total area for each region , the scaling parameters do not vary significantly from 1 , and the point source fluxes and spectra are close to the 1fgl catalogue values .      to account for the effect of the radial variation of @xmath2 on the cr propagation and the los integration when generating the @xmath0-ray sky maps with ,",
    "the above process is iterated using the @xmath2 distribution found from the @xmath0-ray fit back into the propagation parameter determination / transport calculation .",
    "the iteration is done in two steps .",
    "first , we calculate for each annulus the average @xmath2 value , weighted with both the parameterised co gas distribution used in and the integrated co intensity from the annular maps .",
    "these values are then scaled with the values found from the @xmath0-ray fit . to have a smoothly varying @xmath2@xmath62",
    ", we use power - law interpolation between the scaled values .",
    "we use @xmath2@xmath63 @xmath64(k km / s)@xmath65 for the initial radial variation of @xmath2 , compatible with the results from .",
    "there is no formal criterion for stopping the process , but we have found that it converges after a few iterations .",
    "the results we report in this paper are obtained after 4 iterations .",
    "for brevity , we use the short hand notation @xmath66x@xmath67 where x is the first letter of the cr source distribution , @xmath14 and @xmath13 are given in units of kpc , @xmath36 in units of k , and @xmath68 is the _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ magnitude cut .",
    "in addition , for figures comparing the entire set of models , each set of model parameters is given a number .",
    "the number is a binary encoding of the input parameters and the mapping is given in table  [ tab : numbermapping ] . as an example , the model with a yusifov cr source distribution , @xmath69  kpc , @xmath70  kpc , @xmath71  k , and _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ magnitude cut of 2  mag gets the number 1011100 + 1 = 93 .    due to the limited freedom in the dge model ,",
    "the parameters determined from the @xmath0-ray - fit can be biased if some important component is not included in the model or because of some systematic uncertainty in the dge model . however , determining the parameters from the data is appropriate because their values are known _ a priori _ only with some error .",
    "note that this is a general limitation of any parameter determination from a maximum likelihood fit where the model does not perfectly parameterise the data .",
    "the best - fit dge models to the @xmath0-ray data are determined by comparing their maximum likelihoods ( see appendix  [ appendix : gardian ] ) where higher values are a qualitatively better fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammalikelihood ] shows the logarithm of the maximum likelihoods of all the models for the 3 different fit regions : local , outer galaxy , and inner galaxy .",
    "no single model stands out as providing the best - fit in all three regions simultaneously .",
    "the largest difference between models occurs in the outer galaxy .",
    "because the difference is about 3 times larger in the outer galaxy than other regions , the outer galaxy would dominate in an all - sky likelihood ratio test .    while none of the models provides a best - fit for all three regions simultaneously , there are patterns in the likelihood results that are similar between regions .",
    "the most general trend is that increasing @xmath14 improves the likelihood in all regions , though the effect is strongest for the outer galaxy .",
    "it is also in the outer galaxy that the difference between models employing different cr source distributions is most pronounced , with the flat snr distribution favoured over the distributions of pulsars and ob stars , which are more peaked in the inner galaxy .",
    "however , this is strongly dependent on @xmath14 and the effect nearly disappears for @xmath69  kpc .",
    "the outer galaxy also shows an increase in likelihood with larger values of @xmath13 , especially combined with high values of @xmath14 .",
    "the models giving the highest cr flux in the outer galaxy therefore give the largest likelihood .",
    "this need for an increased flux in the outer galaxy compared to standard propagation models has been shown in other _",
    "fermi_lat analyses @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath36 also has a significant impact on the likelihood values of the models , although the effect differs from region to region .",
    "a value of @xmath71  k is preferred in the outer galaxy , which is consistent with requiring an increased flux in this region .",
    "lower values of @xmath36 give higher column densities of h  i that increase the @xmath0-ray intensity of the models .",
    "the effect of @xmath36 is different in the local region , where the optically thin assumption for h  i is preferred . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : dust ] , the h  i column density is replaced by that estimated from dust and @xmath36 becomes a proxy for a certain gas - to - dust ratio given in table  [ tab : gas - to - dustratio ] .",
    "a similar consideration applies in the inner galaxy region , where optically thin h  i gives both the maximum and minimum likelihood depending on the value of the adopted _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ cut .",
    "the higher cut of 5 magnitudes gives the best - fit and thus the _",

    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ is a better total column density tracer than h  i and co combined in the galactic plane .",
    "while the likelihood ratio test allows comparison between different models , it is not an absolute measure . as we show in section  [ sec",
    ": visuals ] , there are large scale residuals remaining after model subtraction , which indicate missing components in the models that might bias the comparison .",
    "however , because the residuals exhibit a spatial structure that is different from the dge , we do not think there is a strong bias .      while the likelihood ratio test is effective for comparing different models , it is not able to describe the accuracy of each model separately .",
    "examining residual maps and spectra for different sky regions , along with the longitude and latitude profiles , is a direct method for comparison of models with data .",
    "figure  [ fig : countsexample ] shows the counts observed with the _ fermi_lat in the energy range 200  mev to 100  gev considered in this paper and also the predicted counts from model @xmath66s@xmath72 , which we take as our reference model ( the use of this as the reference model is not arbitrary because its parameters are similar to the `` conventional '' model employed in earlier work @xcite ) .",
    "this illustrates the general good agreement across the sky between model and data .",
    "however , looking in detail reveals discrepancies in particular regions .",
    "we discuss these in the following sections .",
    "due to space constraints , we will not show figures for all of the models considered in the paper .",

    "the figures for all of the models are available in the online supplementary material .",
    "note , the comparison models incorporate the factors found from the fit to the @xmath0-ray data so directly comparing the output using the galdef files provided in the online supplementary material will not give identical results .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigmaresiduals ] shows the residual sky maps in units of standard deviations for models @xmath66s@xmath72 and @xmath66l@xmath73 .",
    "all models display large - scale residuals with similar , but not identical , features . a more physical way of comparing the models to the data are fractional residual maps , @xmath74 , shown in figure  [ fig : fractionalresiduals ] for the same models .",
    "the galactic plane shows significant ( greater than @xmath75 ) positive and negative structure in the inner galaxy , but mainly positive in the outer galaxy .",
    "while the residuals are statistically significant , figure  [ fig : fractionalresiduals ] shows that the fractional difference in the inner galactic plane is less than 10% .",
    "all of the models considered have large positive residuals at intermediate and high latitudes about the galactic centre , most notably features coincident with those described by @xcite and @xcite , and a feature that is similar to the radio - detected loop  i @xcite .",
    "the negative residual of the magellanic stream is also visible in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it was not subtracted from the h  i annular column density maps because its contribution to the column density was incorrectly assumed to be negligible . however",
    ", this does not affect our model comparison because the models all include this same extra column density . due to the limited freedom in our fits of the dge to the @xmath0-ray sky",
    ", no attempt will be made here to characterise these residual structures but we do note that their shapes depend on the assumed dge model .",
    "point sources are also evident in the large - scale residuals , indicating that the point - source fluxes determined by the fit are biased in these areas .",
    "however , their psf - like spatial extent prevents them from affecting the dge modelling significantly . only in areas with many overlapping point sources , such as in the galactic ridge , can they mimic the structure of the dge .",
    "our tests have shown that inaccurate source modelling causes less than 20% variations in the derived @xmath2 factors , less than the variation caused by the cr source distribution and gas properties ( see section  [ sec : xco ] ) .",
    "the track of the sun along the ecliptic can also be seen ( particularly in the north ) , although it is not very prominent .",
    "the quiet sun is a source of high - energy @xmath0-rays from cr nuclei interacting in its atmosphere @xcite and cr electrons and positrons ic scattering of the heliospheric photon field @xcite .",
    "however , when averaged over a year the overall intensity of this component is very small , being less than 5% of the isotropic background over most of the sky @xcite , and does not affect the large - scale dge modelling significantly .",
    "the moon also contributes to the emission from the ecliptic , being nearly as bright as the sun around 100  mev .",
    "but , the equivalent diffuse intensity from the moving moon is less due to the inclination of its orbit relative to the ecliptic .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum from the moon is also steeper than that of the sun @xcite and does not contribute at a detectable level above 10  gev .    for comparisons between models ,",
    "we calculate the differences between the absolute values of the fractional residual maps for the models .",
    "these maps show directly which model better fits the data while the difference between the models might be larger than shown in these plots .",
    "to study the effects of individual parameters , we compare models where only a single model grid parameter is varied . in figure  [ fig : distdifffractresiduals ] we show the difference residual maps for variation of only the cr source distribution , changes in the size of the cr confinement volume in figure  [ fig : halodifffractresiduals ] , and variations of the gas properties in figure  [ fig : gasdifffractresiduals ] .",
    "while only a single model grid parameter is changed between the models , there are related changes in the propagation parameters , cr source injection spectrum , isrf scale factor , @xmath2-factors , isotropic spectrum , and point source spectra resulting from the cr and @xmath0-ray fits that also affect the results .",
    "the variation of the gas - related parameters has the largest and most distributed effect across the sky .",
    "varying the _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ magnitude cut produces differences that are mostly confined to the galactic plane , but the small change in the gas - to - dust ratio ( see table  [ tab : gas - to - dustratio ] ) has an effect at higher latitudes .",
    "changing @xmath36 gives large positive and negative differences over the sky .",
    "the most striking feature is toward the outer galaxy , where changing from @xmath39  k to the optically thin approximation mostly improves the agreement at intermediate latitudes , but generally worsens it in the outer galaxy plane .",
    "the improvement at intermediate latitudes seems to correlate at least somewhat with the distribution of co at intermediate latitudes seen in figure  [ fig : corings ] , indicating that the gamma - ray signal is sensitive to the ratio of the gas - to - dust ratios for h  i and co. another explanation might be a galacto - centric gradient of the gas - to - dust ratios , it being higher in the outer galaxy in agreement with the increased metallicity in the outer galaxy . other variations at high latitude are not as strong but still significant . due to the diffusive propagation of crs throughout the galaxy , the steady state cr distribution should not show strong variations on the scales that are needed to account for the differences shown in the figure .",
    "this indicates rather that the assumption of a single @xmath36 value , and hence gas - to - dust ratio , should be reconsidered in subsequent work .",
    "while variation of the assumed cr source distribution does not show as strong as an effect as for the gas properties , significant differences are still seen over the sky .",
    "no single cr source distribution is best for all regions of the sky .",
    "a strong asymmetric feature in the direction of the inner galaxy can be seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : distdifffractresiduals ] , having opposite signs above and below the plane , indicating a missing asymmetry in the model , either in terms of gas properties or cr flux .",
    "the outer galaxy shows similar features , where the intermediate latitudes and the plane have opposite signs .",
    "this is most easily seen in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : distdifffractresiduals ] where we have an improvement in the fit in the plane but worsening at intermediate latitudes .",
    "because the snr distribution provides more cr flux in the outer galaxy , this indicates that the gas distribution could be more closely confined to the plane in the outer galaxy than estimated in our modelling .",
    "this possibility has been studied by who found a reduced extension in @xmath9 of the gas distribution in the outer galaxy when assuming the gas in the halo rotated more slowly than gas in the plane .",
    "variation of the halo size parameters produces low - level residuals , both positive and negative , in different regions of the sky .",
    "the halo size , @xmath14 , has the strongest influence in the outer galaxy and in the region above and below the galactic plane in the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "the former can be explained by increased cr flux in the outer galaxy when @xmath14 is increased , while the latter is due to increased ic emission in the direction of the galactic centre caused by a longer integration path length along the los .",
    "the increase in ic emission is suppressed somewhat because the normalisation of the isrf is anti - correlated with @xmath14 ( see section  [ sec : isrfscale ] ) .",
    "increasing @xmath13 affects only the outer galaxy significantly , where the models with larger @xmath13 better agree with the data .",
    "the effect of varying a single parameter on the derived residuals can be strongly interdependent on the other adopted input parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : gasdifffractresiduals ] where the difference in residuals when varying @xmath36 for two different sets of the other input parameters is shown .",
    "the changes are clearly different depending on the input parameters and the resulting parameters found from the cr and @xmath0-ray fits .    finally , to illustrate the differences between models where more than one parameter is changed , we compare in figure  [ fig : referencedifffractresiduals ] models @xmath66l@xmath73 , @xmath66y@xmath76 , and @xmath66o@xmath77 to the reference model @xmath66s@xmath72 .",
    "the models were chosen to illustrate the range of our parameter scan . while some models fare better than others in the likelihood ratio tests ( see figure  [ fig : gammalikelihood ] )",
    ", there is no model that is uniformly better than the other models .",
    "there are large - scale positive and negative differences between the models that are distributed over the entire sky , although the greatest differences are at low latitudes .",
    "we emphasise that differences between models can be non - linear , and caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting low - level residual structures because of subtle interplay between the different model parameters .",
    "we plot the spectra of models and data for several selected regions .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : localregion ] that the models give on - average a good description of the _",
    "fermi_lat data at high and intermediate latitudes . even though the likelihoods of the models differ significantly the model predictions for the total intensity fall within the systematic error of the _ fermi_lat effective area , deviating less than 10% from the data over the entire energy range .",
    "this is partly due to the freedom we have when fitting for the isotropic background ( see section  [ sec : isotropic ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : polarcapregion ] shows that we over - predict the data in the south polar cap , an indication that the isotropic component is too large and compensating for inaccuracies in the dge models .",
    "but , even for the intermediate latitude region shown in figure  [ fig : lowintermlatregion ] , where the dge dominates the isotropic component , the agreement is very good .",
    "the models in the current paper agree better with the intermediate latitude data ( figure  [ fig : lowintermlatregion ] ) than the model presented in @xcite for two main reasons .",
    "first , we use dust as an additional tracer for gas densities that has been shown to give better results than using only h  i and co tracers @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for intermediate latitudes in the direction toward the inner galaxy , which is the brightest part of the low intermediate latitude region .",
    "second , we allow for freedom in both the isrf scale factor and @xmath2 to tune the model to the data , which is well motivated given the uncertainty in those input parameters .",
    "the models in general do not fare as well in the galactic plane where they systematically under - predict the data above a few gev but over - predict it at energies below a gev .",
    "this is most pronounced in the inner galaxy ( figure  [ fig : innerregion ] ) , but can also be seen in the outer galaxy ( figure  [ fig : outerregion ] ) , with even a small excess at intermediate latitudes ( figure  [ fig : lowintermlatregion ] ) .",
    "possible explanations for this discrepancy are deferred to the discussion section .",
    "we note that the dip in the data visible between 10 and 20 gev is due to the irfs used in the present analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : pass7spectra ] shows a comparison of model @xmath66s@xmath72 to the data in the outer galaxy using the pass 7 clean photons .",
    "the dip between 10 and 20  gev is greatly reduced because of the improved effective area of the new photon class . because our results do not depend strongly on the exact shapes of the spectra of the data",

    "the under - prediction in the plane is mostly dependent on the cr flux in the outer galaxy ( cr source distribution and halo height ) , while the over - prediction at intermediate latitudes depends mostly on the assumed @xmath36 value and therefore gas - to - dust ratio ( see section  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "these effects can be seen also toward the inner galaxy ( figure  [ fig : latprofileeastwestgalaxy200 ] ) , but the effect is mostly absent toward the galactic centre ( figure  [ fig : latprofilegalacticcenter ] ) .",

    "a residual structure coincident with the h@xmath3 component is not seen in any of the other latitude profiles .",
    "the under - prediction in the outer galaxy can also be seen in the longitude profiles in the galactic plane ( figure  [ fig : lonprofilegalacticplane200 ] ) where peaks in the h@xmath3 component corresponds with dips in the residual .",

    "the origin of this asymmetry is not currently known .",
    "it is more likely associated with an asymmetry in the cr flux rather than the ism , because the ism is more observationally constrained .",
    "the model under - prediction above a few gev seen in figure  [ fig : innerregion ] and figure  [ fig : outerregion ] is confined to the galactic plane , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : latprofileoutergalaxyother ] .",
    "the model systematically under - predicts the data in the plane in the @xmath80 gev and @xmath79 gev energy bands , but very little excess emission is seen at higher latitudes .",
    "this is not seen as clearly in the galactic centre profile ( figure  [ fig : latprofilegalacticcenter ] ) because that region also includes other large scale residuals , most notably due to features coincident with those described by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : lonprofilegalacticplane200 ] shows the longitude profile about the galactic plane for a few different models .",

    "it is unlikely that the small angular scale fluctuations are due to small - scale cr intensity variations because the bulk of the cr nuclei producing the dge for the energy range shown are smoothly distributed .",
    "the variations are then mostly caused by features in the annular gas maps that introduce artifacts on small angular scales .",
    "this suggests that the gas - to - dust ratio is not constant over the sky and can fluctuate by at least 10% .",

    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : xco_annuli ] , which shows @xmath2 derived for the local annulus for all models .",
    "the local @xmath2 varies by up to a factor of 2 depending on the value of @xmath36 and the _ e(b@xmath45v)_magnitude cut but is nearly independent of the other input parameters . because the emissivity of the local gas is well determined by observations of crs , this shows that an accurate determination of the h  i column density is important for determining @xmath2 values from @xmath0-ray data .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath2 is not surprising .",
    "the limited freedom in the @xmath0-ray fit can bias the derived values as has already been mentioned .",

    ", we calculate the emissivity assuming a cr distribution and estimate the intensity from a fit to the @xmath0-ray data .",
    "if the emissivity is incorrectly estimated , the intensity associated with co will be biased in the opposite direction , resulting in the twofold bias .",
    "methods that determine the emissivity of the gas simultaneously with the intensity associated with co are independent of this bias , as long as the emissivity is accurately determined from the data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) note that the effect of variations in n(h  i ) applies in all cases .",
    "however , the scatter in the @xmath2 we determine does not significantly affect our comparison between the models except possibly in the inner galaxy where the molecular gas content is greatest .    despite the large variations of the @xmath2 factors between the models there",

    "there also seems to be a dip in @xmath2 for the local annulus that was not in .",
    "our values for the local region @xmath2 agree very well with the value found for the nearby gould belt by @xcite . because the @xmath2 values for this annulus are determined from fits to the local region , the value is associated with high latitude clouds .",
    "this indicates that molecular clouds in the vicinity of the solar system may have different properties than clouds at a similar galactocentric distance .",
    "high latitude translucent clouds have also been shown before to have lower @xmath2 values @xcite but more recent work based on other tracers of molecular hydrogen show that co intensities might not be linearly related to h@xmath3 column densities in those clouds @xcite .",
    "there is an exponential increase in the outer galaxy that is strongly dependent on the assumed cr source distribution , halo size , and @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cooutergalaxy ] shows the fractional residual ( see section  [ sec : visuals ] ) for model @xmath66s@xmath72 with the integrated co emission in the outer galaxy overlaid .",
    "a correlation between the co emission and negative residuals is evident . on this basis",
    ", we conclude that the @xmath2 values in the outer galaxy derived in our analysis are strongly biased and we do not show them in figure  [ fig : xco_radial ] .",
    "this bias is caused by the under - prediction of @xmath0-ray intensity in the outer galaxy by all of the models considered here .",
    "because there is very little co in the outer galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : corings ] ) this bias will not strongly affect our results , only slightly reduce the scatter when comparing the models in the outer galaxy .",
    "the scaling factor of the isrf is shown in figure  [ fig : isrfscale ] for each model in both the local and inner region .",
    "the derived isrf scaling factor is model dependent and varies with cr source distribution , gas densities , and halo size . in general , the scaling factor is smaller for the pulsar cr source distributions that are more peaked towards the inner galaxy than both the ob stars and snr distributions .",
    "more crs will be injected in the inner galaxy from the pulsar - like source distributions .",
    "this produces a corresponding increase in the ic emission in this region because of the larger number of cr electrons and positrons for these source distributions .",
    "the isrf scaling factor is also dependent on @xmath36 and the _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ magnitude cut , indicating that the normalisation of the isrf ( and of the ic intensities ) serves to compensate for different gas densities in the fits .",
    "this is despite the ic component being both spectrally and also spatially different from the h  i component .",
    "the latitude dependence of the ic component is similar enough to the h  icomponent ( see figure  [ fig : latprofilegalacticcenter ] ) to allow for the correlation between the h  i and ic components in the fit .",
    "coupling that with the trend between increased likelihood in the inner region for the optically thin case seems to indicate that a greater intensity of ic is needed for all models , either from an increased isrf , more cr electron sources , or a larger @xmath14 .",
    "the longer confinement time for the cr electrons / positrons for the larger halo sizes , together with the approximately @xmath82 decrease of the isrf perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite , produces more ic emission for cases with larger @xmath14 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this effect can be seen as a decrease in the scaling factor in the local region with increasing @xmath14 , although the magnitude of the decrease depends on the assumed cr source distribution and gas densities .",
    "the isrf scaling factors follow a trend that they are larger for the inner galaxy region for larger @xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that further enhancement is required in addition to that provided by the large @xmath14 , which could be due to additional cr electrons / positrons , or an increase in the isrf in the inner galaxy region . disentangling these effects",
    "is difficult .",
    "one way could be to consider the ic from cmb photons along with the bremsstrahlung emission . unfortunately , their overall intensity is not high enough to allow them to be used to constrain the cr electron component .",
    "the isrf scaling factors therefore only allow us to infer that the ic modelling requires modifications but a detailed investigation is needed to unravel their origin .",
    "the spectrum of the derived isotropic background is shown in figure  [ fig : isotropic ] for selected models .",
    "isotropic spectra for all models can be found in the online supplementary material . as for the isrf normalisation and @xmath2 values",
    ", the isotropic background is model dependent .",
    "however , the variation in the overall normalisation is not very large because it is spatially very different from the other fitted components .",
    "the derived spectral shape is also very similar amongst the various models .",
    "both of these indicate that the isotropic background is not strongly biased by variations between the different models .",
    "figure  [ fig : isotropic ] also shows a comparison with the isotropic spectrum from @xcite after combining the derived egb and rib components from that work .",
    "our estimates of the isotropic background are consistent with @xcite below 1  gev , and systematically higher above this energy . despite our efforts to minimise the contribution of the galactic ridge to the determination of the isotropic background by fitting for the local region , figure  [ fig : lowintermlatregion ] shows that the model slightly underestimates the data at low intermediate latitudes above 1  gev while still being within the systematic uncertainty of the _ fermi_lat data .",
    "the fit will compensate for this with the isotropic component as can be seen in figure  [ fig : polarcapregion ] where the model overestimates the data in the polar cap regions above 1  gev .",
    "this is especially true in the south polar cap .",
    "the difference in the two estimates of the isotropic background can therefore be attributed to the additional freedom allowed in the diffuse galactic emission model in the analysis of @xcite where the intensity spectrum of the local h  i annulus and the ic component was allowed to vary freely .",
    "the motivations for this additional freedom were the uncertainties associated with the observed cr intensities that are around few percent at energies above 100 gev reaching more than ten percent below 10 gev caused by the uncertainty in solar modulation , and the size of the cr halo .",
    "the combination of these can produce variations both in the h  i - related and ic emission . because our models predict the _",
    "fermi_lat data within the systematic error we do not try to account for this uncertainty in this analysis .",
    "the isotropic spectrum from @xcite is therefore a better measurement .",
    "this does not affect the comparison between the models considered in this paper because they are all treated identically .      because the main purpose of the fit to cr data is to obtain a propagation model consistent with cr observations , we defer most of the discussion of the results to appendix  [ appendix : cr ] and only summarise the few key points here .",
    "we emphasise that all the models give a good representation of the cr data as can be seen in figure  [ fig : crspectrumprimary ] and figure  [ fig : crspectrumsecondary ] .",
    "this has been shown earlier for similar diffusive reacceleration models  @xcite .",
    "but , models with @xmath83 kpc are at the limit of consistency with the observed @xmath23be/@xmath24be ratio and therefore considering larger values for @xmath14 is not warranted .",
    "the propagation parameters from the fits shown in figure  [ fig : crparametersnuc ] and figure  [ fig : crparametersnuc2 ] are generally in agreement with values found from similar analyses  @xcite",
    ". the values are also stable between the different models , with notable exceptions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these parameters are strongly correlated with @xmath14 and the properties of the gas distribution , that is the @xmath2 profile .",
    "the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also slightly affected by the assumed cr source distribution .",
    "therefore , the values for these parameters should be interpreted in the context of the entire model that they were determined from because they depend not only on the propagation set up , but also the distributions of gas and assumed cr sources .",
    "the agreement between all our models and the _ fermi_lat data is , on average , good despite minimal fitting .",
    "the models generally agree within @xmath84% of the data over most of the sky except for regions discussed below . in figure",
    "[ fig : localemissivity ] we show the predicted emissivities of the local annulus for a few example models and compare them with emissivities derived from the _ fermi_lat data using different methods @xcite .",
    "the agreement is in line with our results from the local region ; the models predict the local emissivities within the scatter of the observations .",
    "the scatter between different _",
    "fermi_lat results is most likely caused by uncertainties in the column densities of gas used in the template fitting .",
    "the parameter scan was deliberately limited due to computational constraints .",
    "however , it does provide insight into the effects associated with the variations of different parameters . for a given assumption on the cr propagation model , variations of the gas - related parameters",
    "give the largest variations in log - likelihoods for the @xmath0-ray fit over the entire sky .",
    "the cr source distribution and halo size , however , show such large effects on the likelihood ratio in the outer galaxy only .",
    "similarly , the gas - related parameters have a large effect on the residual sky maps at all angular scales , which contrasts with the much smoother structures caused by changes in the assumed cr source distribution and size of the confinement volume . understanding the galactic gas distribution and its different phases is essential for accurate modelling of the dge .",
    "the most important parameter in our scan is the h  i spin temperature used for the optical depth correction for deriving n(h  i ) . for our analysis",
    ", we considered two values , @xmath36 = 150 k and @xmath36 very large ( i.e. , the optically thin approximation ) .",
    "this is a highly simplified approach because observations show @xmath36 varies from 10s  to 1000s  of  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a preliminary study showed that alternative approximations for the value of @xmath36 can significantly improve the agreement between dge models and _",
    "fermi_lat  data @xcite .",
    "further improvements include taking into account h  i self - absorption @xcite and uncertainties in the rotation curve for the h  i distribution , which will be explored in future work .",
    "we confirm the need for augmenting the use of co and h  i line observations as tracers of the interstellar gas with infrared observations of interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "dust reveals some molecular hydrogen that is not traced by co which can compensate to some extent for errors in or variations of the spin temperature of the interstellar hydrogen .",
    "the dust column density is represented in this work as the equivalent interstellar reddening _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ and limitations of the color correction method used to derive the reddening maps make them less accurate near the galactic plane .",
    "but our analysis shows that the @xmath0-ray fit improves with the inclusion of dust near the galactic plane , up to a reddening magnitude of 5 .",
    "the disadvantage of _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ as a tracer of interstellar gas is that it provides no distance information analogous to the doppler shifts of the co and h  i lines due to differential rotation of the milky way , and for this work we distributed the `` excess '' _ e(b@xmath45v)_-associated column densities like the inferred distribution of h  i. this distribution of the `` excess '' is reasonable in regions with little or no co emission but is suspect near large molecular clouds , where the `` excess '' should be mostly low density h@xmath3 gas not traced by co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the models all under - predict the data in the galactic plane ( figure  [ fig : outerregion ] ) above a few gev and the difference is most pronounced in the inner galaxy ( figure  [ fig : innerregion ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the difference is much less than the so - called egret `` gev excess '' and is also confined to the plane .",
    "a possible explanation for this is a contribution by point sources such as pulsars , snrs , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) .",
    "only a fraction of these are actually detected individually by the _ fermi_lat .",
    "the contribution by source populations below the detection threshold is currently undetermined and it may have a diffuse - like spatial distribution . a study of this topic based on egret data , with predictions for the _",
    "fermi_lat , was made by , giving estimates of a @xmath85% contribution by sources below the _",
    "fermi_lat detection threshold .",
    "pulsars are the largest contributor to detected galactic sources in the 2fgl catalogue @xcite , being far more numerous than snrs and pwn",
    ". this class might dominate the contribution by undetected sources , but due to their spectral cutoffs above @xmath6  gev they can not completely explain the spectral difference that we find at higher energies .",
    "this will be addressed in a subsequent paper , employing a population - synthesis approach and comparison with the 2fgl catalogue to constrain possible source contributions .",
    "another possibility is that the inner milky way contains fresh cr sources with a harder spectrum in addition to the presumed steady - state cr population that has undergone propagation .",
    "signs of freshly accelerated crs have been recently observed in the cygnus region @xcite and more regions are likely to be discovered in the future .",
    "observations with _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ of the galactic plane at tev energies may partly support this explanation .",
    "the _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ observations showed @xmath0-ray emission associated with molecular clouds that have harder spectra than expected from extrapolation of lower - energy spectra @xcite .",
    "but , freshly accelerated crs are an unlikely explanation for the excess emission in the outer galaxy .",
    "another alternative is that local cr measurements do not sample the average cr spectra in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : isotropic ] , the uncertainties in the observed cr intensities have not been propagated to the dge models .",
    "a 10% decrease in @xmath0-ray intensity below 1 gev and a few percent increase above 1 gev with additionally an overall increase in the total cr intensity would make the model agree with the data .",
    "the current analysis can not distinguish between these alternatives , and most likely a combination will contribute to providing the required additional @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "contrasting with the under - prediction at @xmath86 few  gev , the models over - predict the data at lower energies with the largest residual in the @xmath87  mev bin . while being most prominent in the inner galaxy ( figure  [ fig : innerregion ] ) ,",
    "this can also be seen to a lesser extent at low intermediate latitudes ( figure  [ fig : lowintermlatregion ] ) .",
    "the over - prediction at low energies is fractionally smaller than the under - prediction at higher energies and is partly contained within the systematical uncertainty of the effective area of the _ fermi_lat .",
    "we note , however , that the discrepancy is still visible using the updated instrument response in the pass 7 event selection ( figure  [ fig : pass7spectra ] ) suggesting that the effect is not entirely instrumental .",
    "the effect is strongest in the plane indicating that the @xmath32-decay spectrum is primarily responsible for the mismatch .",
    "the @xmath0-rays below @xmath88  gev are produced mainly by cr protons with energies @xmath89 gev .",
    "the locally measured cr proton spectrum ( figure  [ fig : crspectrumprimary ] ) for these energies is affected by the solar modulation and is therefore subject to any errors we make in correcting for this effect . while the force - field approximation used in this paper is a useful parameterisation , realistic models of the heliospheric cr transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could allow better determination of the low - energy interstellar cr nuclei spectra that are relevant for the calculation of the @xmath32-decay @xmath0-ray emission in our dge models .",
    "the force - field approximation is however sufficient for the analysis done in this paper as we are mainly concerned with comparing the models with each other .",
    "finally , we note that reducing the spectrum below 1  gev and using a higher overall normalisation for the cr nuclei results in an increase in the @xmath32-decay dge spectrum above @xmath90  gev",
    ". therefore , the excess above a few gev can also be partly due to uncertainties in how the solar modulation is handled when fitting to the observed cr spectra .    despite the good agreement between model and data on average ,",
    "there are structures seen on both small and large scales in the residual sky maps ( figure  [ fig : fractionalresiduals ] ) .",
    "small - scale discrepancies are inevitable for any large - scale -based model because simplifications have to be made to treat the cr transport together with the cr source , gas and isrf distributions . in particular , the assumption of axisymmetry for the cr source distribution and the isrf is not a realistic model for the 3d distribution .",
    "apart from loop  i , the magellanic stream , and the structures coincident with the features found by @xcite and @xcite , the most prominent of the large - scale residuals is the excess in the outer galaxy . our analysis shows the observed intensities in the outer galaxy are greater than predicted using conventional choices for the values of the parameters that we studied . despite differing by more than a factor of 3 in cr density outside of 10  kpc ,",
    "all of the cr source distributions considered in this paper gives a model that under - predicts the observed @xmath0-ray emissivity in the outer galaxy .",
    "the models all show an increased likelihood for larger @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : gammalikelihood ] ) that has been shown to increase the cr flux in the outer galaxy @xcite but the large values of @xmath14 are approaching the bounds for consistency with the observed @xmath23be/@xmath24be ratio ( figure  [ fig : crspectrumsecondary ] ) .",
    "another possibility is to increase the density of cr sources in the outer galaxy .",
    "this would mean that snrs , or cr source classes having a similar spatial distribution as the proxies considered in this paper , are not the only source of crs @xcite .",
    "modifications of the cr propagation mechanism have also been proposed in the literature as an explanation for increased cr flux in the outer galaxy @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "large amounts of gas not traced by 21-cm - emitting h  i and co ( as the tracer of h@xmath3 ) surveys may be present in the outer galaxy @xcite , which would also increase the @xmath0-ray emission . breaking this degeneracy and deriving the correct cr source distribution and propagation model",
    "requires using all available data for crs and their interactions in the ism .",
    "such a determination would inevitably have to take into account uncertainties involved in the astrophysical input to the models discussed in this paper .",
    "the increase in log - likelihood for larger values of @xmath14 is also seen in the local region ( figure  [ fig : gammalikelihood ] ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath14 is accompanied by a decrease in the isrf scaling factor ( figure  [ fig : isrfscale ] ) , indicating that additional ic emission at high latitudes is needed compared to the previously assumed @xmath91  kpc propagation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the longer confinement time for the cr electrons / positrons in the larger halo sized models results in more ic emission for these cases . from our analysis ,",
    "the derived normalisation of the ic component and its intensity varies considerably between cr source distributions .",
    "because the spectral shape of the normalised ic emission is similar in all cases , the spatial distribution of this component determines the inferred ic contribution to the dge for each model .",
    "this emphasises that accurate modelling of the spatial distribution of the ic emission is essential to properly assess its intensity and spectrum from @xmath0-ray data .",
    "we have also explored how the uncertainties affect the cr propagation ( figure  [ fig : crparametersnuc ] ) , aiming for a self - consistent model by incorporating the @xmath2 values found from the @xmath0-ray fit into the propagation parameter determination and transport calculations .",
    "self - consistency , as used in this paper , is intended to ensure that the cr secondary - to - primary ratios and other direct measurements are consistent with the assumed @xmath36 and fitted @xmath2 , which affect the gas density and hence cr secondary production . for an assumed set of input parameters ,",
    "this is obtained by adjusting the spatial and momentum - space diffusion coefficients via @xmath21 and the alfvn speed @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for the cr protons and he the propagated cr intensities and spectra are determined mostly by the assumed cr source distribution and boundary conditions because their energy loss time scales for the energies of interest in this paper are long compared to the propagation time scale .",
    "the cr electrons and positrons are more strongly affected by changes in the diffusion coefficient and halo size because their energy losses are much faster .",
    "the modelled cr intensities and spectra are also constrained by their normalisation to the locally measured data , so the self - consistency requirement does not significantly change the @xmath0-ray models and results for these models in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is an important criterion to ensure that the origin of systematic effects from the assumed input parameters can be properly attributed .",
    "it is important to also emphasise that uncertainties in the input parameters can also affect the determination of the propagation parameters . simply assuming that one set of propagation parameters applies equally to all variations of , e.g. , assumed cr source distributions , is incorrect .",
    "note , that even though we have assumed a diffusive - reacceleration model for the cr propagation , this applies to the other variants such as pure diffusion models , models with convection , and so forth .",
    "this paper presents a systematic study of several basic parameters for global models of the dge using _ fermi_lat data .",
    "the parameters , all inputs to the cr propagation code , are related to the distributions of interstellar gas and of crs , and for each combination of parameters considered the models were calculated self consistently and were constrained to be consistent with local measurements of crs .",
    "the evaluation of the models with respect to the data , taking into account the point sources in the 1fgl catalogue , was made with the _ gardian _ software package , which was developed for studying diffuse emission in the _",
    "fermi_lat data .",
    "we find that augmenting the co and h  i column density estimate with column density estimates from dust improves agreement between model and @xmath0-ray data .",
    "our analysis finds this to be true even near the galactic plane , where the dust column density estimated from the equivalent interstellar reddening _",
    "e(b@xmath45v ) _ is less accurate due to limitations of the color correction method used to derive the reddening maps .",
    "the dge in the outer galaxy is better fit by models with larger - than - expected cr halo sizes .",
    "there are other possiblities for the models to predict large enough intensities in the outer galaxy .",
    "these include modifications of the assumed distributions of cr sources or of propagation of crs in the outer galaxy , or even the presence of much greater amounts of interstellar gas than currently assumed",
    ".    from our @xmath0-ray fits in the region with @xmath54 we show that larger ic intensities provide a better fit to the data for most models . in our approach ,",
    "the single normalisation factor for the optical and ir components of the isrf that is shown to decrease with larger halo size provides this information .",
    "in addition to accounting for uncertainties in the isrf , this normalisation factor also encapsulates uncertainties in the distribution of cr electrons in the galaxy .",
    "all of the models considered in the paper under - predict the data above a few gev in the galactic plane .",
    "the magnitude of the difference is much less than the `` gev excess '' observed by egret and mostly confined to the galactic plane .",
    "two possible explanations were discussed , contribution from undetected sources and variations in the cr spectra .",
    "further analysis is needed to estimate the contribution from each .",
    "we derived the radial distribution of @xmath2 for all models and confirmed the systematically lower values of @xmath2 for the inner - most annulus ( 0  1.5 kpc ) .",
    "the @xmath2 determined for the local annulus ( 8  10 kpc ) above @xmath92 latitude was also systematically lower than for the rest of the galaxy , implying that the local high latitude clouds have different properties than the galactic average .",
    "our @xmath2 values for other radial ranges show that accurate determination of the cr gradient and the column density of the h  i gas distribution are essential in determining the @xmath2 gradient from @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "our fits to the @xmath0-ray data reveal the difficulties in accurately determining the properties of the ism or cr propagation with dge modelling .",
    "the derived @xmath2 values and isrf scaling parameters depend strongly on the assumed input parameters , both on the propagation setup and also on the properties of the h  i gas distribution .",
    "past studies using @xmath0-ray data to determine these properties were thus susceptible to unexplored systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measured properties of galactic plane sources even well above the detection limit can be affected by the assumed dge model , especially for energy ranges where the scale of the psf is comparable to the scale of the structure in the dge .",
    "accounting for systematic uncertainties of the astrophysical input needed for a dge model is a necessary step in accurate analysis of @xmath0-ray data when the observed signal is comparable or less than the dge .    the _ fermi_lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the _ fermi_lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .    additional support for science analysis during the operations phase is gratefully acknowledged from the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy and the centre national dtudes spatiales in france .",
    "development is partially funded via nasa grants nnx09ac15 g and nnx10ae78 g .    some of the results in this paper have been derived using the healpix @xcite package .",

    "while the framework is capable of fitting non - linear models , the main emphasis has been on dge models consisting of a linear combination of template sky maps . at this point ,",
    "the _ gardian _",
    "package is not publicly available .",
    "the photon data and model are spatially binned on a healpix grid @xcite that is hierarchical , equal - area , and isolatitude allowing for fast spherical harmonics decomposition and nearest neighbor search . as is appropriate for photon limited data we use a forward folding method for the analysis , turning the model into counts using the irfs .",
    "the gardian package requires knowledge of the exposure as a function of energy for each direction on the sky and a sky average representation of the psf as a function of energy .",
    "this information needs to be provided in tabulated form , which is standard for the _ fermi_lat irfs .    denoting the model flux by @xmath93 and the exposure as @xmath94 ,",
    "we can write the model counts for energy bin @xmath95 as    @xmath96    here , @xmath97 is a position in the sky , @xmath98 is the photon energy , and we have assumed the photon data has been binned in energy bins defined by @xmath99 . to account for the energy dependence of the psf , @xmath100",
    ", we calculate an effective psf for each energy bin as the spectrally - weighted average with the spectra of the model    @xmath101    here , @xmath102 is the angle between the true photon direction and the reconstructed direction and @xmath103 is the sky average of the model counts as a function of energy . using the spherical harmonics @xmath104 , we can write    @xmath105    when using the spherical harmonic decomposition of the psf , we assume @xmath102 is the angle between a point in the sky and the north pole .",
    "we also assume the psf is azimuthally symmetric so all @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the convolved model is now calculated as @xmath108    to allow for arbitrary energy binning of the photon data while still handling strong energy dependence of the irfs , we integrate equations   and   semi - analytically .",
    "we use power - law interpolation of the tabulated input values of the irfs and model . for the psf weighting in eq .  , we use a single effective power - law index for the entire bin because fine structure within the energy bin is lost in the conversion to counts .",
    "while using the spherical harmonics decomposition for convolving the model sky maps with the psf is extremely efficient it has limitations .",
    "we are limited to using an azimuthally - symmetric psf and must assume the psf is the same over the entire sky .",
    "fortunately , the tabulated _",
    "fermi_lat psf is azimuthally symmetric and its variations over the sky are minimal due to both the uniform exposure of the _ fermi_lat in its nominal survey mode operation , and the small variations of the psf with incident angle .",
    "having the model converted to counts and properly convolved , we calculate the likelihood using @xmath109    where @xmath110 are the binned photons for energy bin @xmath95 and healpix pixel @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are the parameters of the model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are found by maximising the likelihood using minuit2 .",
    "under the assumption of uniform circular motion around the galactic centre with rotation curve @xmath113 , the velocity with respect to the local standard of rest of a region with galactocentric distance @xmath114 viewed toward direction @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( in galactic coordinates ) is @xmath117 this relation provides a one - to - one relationship between @xmath118 and @xmath114 for any given los .",

    "we applied this relation to the 21-cm leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) survey of h  i and the 115  ghz center for astrophysics survey of co @xcite to transform the spectral measurements into maps of the emission for a range of galactocentric annuli .",
    "the boundaries of the annuli are given in table  [ tab : annuliboundaries ] .",
    "the @xmath12 kpc width of the annuli is set by the finite non - circular ( random and systematic ) motions of the gas traced by these surveys as well as internal velocity dispersions of molecular clouds .",
    "these non - circular and internal motions limit the practical linear resolution of the velocity - to - distance relation .",
    "the outer annuli are broader because the gradient of @xmath118 with galactocentric distance decreases approximately as @xmath121 beyond the solar circle .",
    "due to non - circular motion of gas in the galaxy , a small fraction of the emission has forbidden velocities .",
    "this can be due to the @xmath118 being greater than the terminal velocity or having an incorrect sign . in our procedure , for the former case the emission is assigned to the tangent point annulus , while for the latter the gas is assigned to the local annulus ( i.e. , the one that spans @xmath119 kpc ) .",
    "in addition , if the gas is placed above a certain height above the galactic plane , it is assumed to be local .",
    "the height differs between the gas distributions and was chosen to be 1  kpc for h  i and @xmath122  kpc for co. these values were chosen to be significantly larger than the scale heights of the gas distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematic resolution of the method vanishes for directions near the galactic centre and galactic anti - centre .",
    "therefore , we linearly interpolate each annulus independently across the ranges @xmath123 and @xmath124 to get an estimate of the radial profile of the gas . to estimate n(h",

    "the interpolated values are then scaled to match the total n(h  i ) or w(co ) along each los in the regions that were interpolated .",
    "note that the innermost annulus is entirely enclosed within the interpolated region , necessitating an alternate method to estimate its column density . for h",
    "i this is accomplished by assuming the innermost annulus contains 60% more gas than its neighbouring annulus .",

    "the specific distribution in the innermost 1.5  kpc does not alter the results of this paper in a significant way .",
    "the co data are from the 115  ghz composite survey of @xcite covering the latitude range @xmath129 .",
    "the coverage is not complete for that range but it is believed that no significant emission is missing . to increase the signal to noise in the data",
    "the co data have been filtered with the moment masking technique @xcite applied to each component of the survey independently to accurately account for varying noise levels .",
    "the sampling grid spacing of the component surveys varies from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , but we rebin to a resolution of 0.25@xmath132 for the annuli .",
    "this degradation of angular resolution does not affect the dge analysis significantly for two main reasons .",
    "first , the angular resolution of _ fermi_lat below 5 gev where the majority of photons are detected is larger than 0.25@xmath132 .",
    "second , the n(h  i ) annuli are anyway limited to 0.5@xmath132 sampling ( see below ) limiting any gains from better co sampling to the inner galactic ridge",

    ", we describe further extension of the code , which has been rewritten to use a parallel monte carlo radiative transfer method .    in our model , we represent the stellar distribution by four spatial components : the thin and thick disc , the bulge , and the spheroidal halo .",

    "the difference in @xmath18 for the different cr source distributions is largely due to differences at low energies , below @xmath6  gev .",

    "a larger halo also increases the ic cooling of the electrons @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath18 values are mostly due to the large fraction of secondaries at low energies , making the ams and _ fermi_lat spectra incompatible , but also due to the convex shape of the observed _",
    "fermi_lat electron spectrum .",
    "this is expected because @xcite found that the form of injection spectrum used in the current analysis does not reproduce all the features of the _ fermi_lat total cr electron data .",
    "the low - energy part could be improved by increasing the modulation potential for the _",
    "fermi_lat observations , but this is not well motivated given the low level of solar activity during the lat sky survey observations analysed here . because the ic and bremsstrahlung components are subdominant in the energy range where the statistics for studying the dge are the greatest , this does not affect our results significantly .",

    "the spectrum found in our analysis is now more akin to the one used in the optimized model by @xcite although the break energy at @xmath159  gv found in this analysis is much lower than the 20  gv break assumed in the optimized model .",
    "the proton spectrum is also slightly different , with a break rigidity at @xmath160  gv instead of 9  gv in @xcite and spectral indices of @xmath161 and @xmath162 below and above the break , respectively , instead of 1.98 and 2.42 used in the conventional model in @xcite .",
    "our proton spectrum is much closer to the one determined in the more recent analysis by @xcite .",
    "most of these differences can be attributed to a different cr source distribution and the inclusion of @xmath2@xmath62 in the propagation calculation .",
    "the values of the propagation parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 agree reasonably well with the older analysis if one chooses similar models for the comparison , since the value of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are correlated with @xmath14 and the gas distribution .",
    "note that only the @xmath2 values were changed for the propagation ; the h  i distribution is constant .",
    "this causes an overestimate of the gas densities in the optically thin assumption , because the analytical model is not corrected for @xmath36 or dust variations , and @xmath2 compensates to a certain degree for the change in h  i column density in the @xmath0-ray fit .",
    "this overestimate enhances the variations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 but does not significantly affect the @xmath0-ray analysis .",
    "note also that the injection spectrum softens with increasing @xmath14 , both for nuclei and electrons , although the variations are barely larger than the error bars .",
    "the error bars on the data are statistical only and no attempt has been made to assess the systematic error .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty is likely associated with the absolute energy scale of the data @xcite .",
    "this can potentially change the location of the break energies along with the intensity of the modelled spectrum .",
    "a 10% change in absolute energy would shift the normalisation by @xmath3330% , which directly translates to a change in the intensity of the dge model .",

    "<S> the @xmath0-ray sky @xmath1 mev is dominated by the diffuse emissions from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and radiation fields of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> observations of these diffuse emissions provide a tool to study cosmic - ray origin and propagation , and the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we present measurements from the first 21 months of the _ fermi_lat mission and compare with models of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission generated using the code . </S>",
    "<S> the models are fitted to cosmic - ray data and incorporate astrophysical input for the distribution of cosmic - ray sources , interstellar gas and radiation fields . to assess uncertainties associated with the astrophysical input , a grid of models </S>",
    "<S> is created by varying within observational limits the distribution of cosmic - ray sources , the size of the cosmic - ray confinement volume ( halo ) , and the distribution of interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> an all - sky maximum - likelihood fit is used to determine the @xmath2-factor , the ratio between integrated co - line intensity and h@xmath3 column density , the fluxes and spectra of the @xmath0-ray point sources from the first _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi_lat catalogue , and the intensity and spectrum of the isotropic background including residual cosmic rays that were misclassified as @xmath0-rays , all of which have some dependency on the assumed diffuse emission model . </S>",
    "<S> the models are compared on the basis of their maximum likelihood ratios as well as spectra , longitude , and latitude profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide residual maps for the data following subtraction of the diffuse emission models . </S>",
    "<S> the models are consistent with the data at high and intermediate latitudes but under - predict the data in the inner galaxy for energies above a few gev . </S>",
    "<S> possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed , including the contribution by undetected point source populations and spectral variations of cosmic rays throughout the galaxy . in the outer galaxy , we find that the data prefer models with a flatter distribution of cosmic - ray sources , a larger cosmic - ray halo , or greater gas density than is usually assumed . </S>",
    "<S> our results in the outer galaxy are consistent with other _ fermi_lat studies of this region that used different analysis methods than employed in this paper . </S>"
