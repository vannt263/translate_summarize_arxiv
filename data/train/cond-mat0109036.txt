    "their quasi-2d nature makes cuprate superconductors ideal materials for angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies , and by now a wealth of experimental data is available@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it does not seem as if these data are really well - understood , the major reason being that we still lack even a rudimentary understanding of the matrix element effects present in these materials .",
    "it has recently turned out that matrix element effects are ( or rather : should be ) the central issue in the discussion of arpes data .",
    "+ arpes is generally believed to measure the single particle spectral function , which near the chemical potential @xmath5 ( and neglecting the finite lifetime ) can be written as @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the dispersion of the ` quasiparticle band ' , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the ground state and quasiparticle state , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the experiment gives a ` peak ' whose dispersion follows the quasiparticle band @xmath10 , with the total intensity of the peak being given by the so - called quasiparticle weight @xmath11 . for free particles we have @xmath12 , whence the only reason for a sudden vanishing of the peak with changing @xmath13 can be the fermi factor @xmath14 , i.e. the crossing of the quasiparticle band through the fermi energy . under these circumstances",
    ", it would be very easy to infer the fermi surface geometry from the measured photoelectron spectra , and indeed this very assumption , namely that a sudden drop of the photoemission intensity automatically indicates a fermi level crossing , has long been made in the interpretation of all experimental spectra on metallic cuprates .",
    "+ several experimental findings have shown , however , that this assumption is not tenable in the cuprates .",
    "the first indication comes from the study of the insulating compounds sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0@xcite and ca@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0@xcite .",
    "although these insulators can not have any fermi surface in the usual sense , which means that the factor @xmath14 is always equal to unity , the experiments show that also in these compounds the quasiparticle peak disappears as one passes from inside the noninteracting fermi surface to outside .",
    "thereby a particularly striking feature of the experimental data is the sharpness of the drop in spectral weight@xcite , which is for example along @xmath15 , quite comparable to the drops seen at the ` fermi level crossings ' in the metallic compounds .",
    "the only possible explanation for this phenomenon is a quite dramatic @xmath13-dependence of the quasiparticle weight , @xmath16 .",
    "apparently in these compounds we have very nearly @xmath17 , i.e. the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath16 resembles that of the noninteracting system .",
    "+ this result immediately raises the question as to how significant the ` fermi level crossings ' observed in the metallic compounds really are . that they may ,",
    "in some cases , have little or no significance for the true fermi surface topology has been demonstrated by the recent controversy as to whether the fermi surface in the most exhaustively studied compound , bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath18 , is hole - like ( as inferred from a large number of studies@xcite with photon energy @xmath19 ) or electron - like ( as concluded by several recent studies@xcite at photon - energy @xmath20 ) . here",
    "it should be noted that the true fermi surface topology is an intrinsic property of the material which can under no circumstances change with the photon energy .",
    "it follows from these considerations that to extract any meaningful information from angle - resolved photoemission we need an understanding of the matrix elements and their @xmath13-dependence , as well as other effects which might possibly influence the intensity of the arpes signal .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have performed a theoretical analysis of the spectral weight of strongly correlated electron models . in section",
    "ii we derive a simple expression for the photoelectron current , which can be applied e.g. in numerical calculations for strong correlation models . in section iii",
    "we specialize this to the cuo@xmath0 plane , in section iv we discuss the angular ` radiation characteristics ' of a zhang - rice singlet and how these could be exploited to optimize the photoemission intensity from the respective states .",
    "we also show that photoelectrons are emitted predominantly at small angles with respect to the cuo@xmath0 plane . in section v we point out that this may lead to the injection of these photoelectrons into surface resonance states .",
    "fano - resonance between the surface resonance and the continuum of leed states then leads to a strong energy dependence of the arpes signal and we show that already a very simple free - electron model can explain the experimental energy dependence of the first ionization states in sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 measured recently by by drr _",
    "et al._@xcite surprisingly well . in section",
    "vi we describe how the interplay between surface state dispersion and fano - resonance between the processes of direct emission and emission via a surface state can mimic a fermi level crossing where none exists , and suggest that the apparent change in fermi surface topology with photon energy may be due to such ` apparent fermi surfaces ' .",
    "section vii contains our conclusions .",
    "photoelectrons with a kinetic energy in the range @xmath21 have wavelengths comparable to the distances between individual atoms in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "it follows that whereas the _ eigenvalue spectrum _ of the plane probably can be described well by an effective single band model@xcite , this is not possible for the _ matrix elements_. we necessarily have to discuss ( at least ) the full three - band model .",
    "+ our first goal therefore is to derive a representation of the photoemission process in terms of the electron annihilation operators for the cu @xmath4 and o @xmath22 orbitals in the cuo@xmath0 plane . in other words , we seek an operator of the form @xmath23 such that the single particle spectral density of this operator @xmath24 evaluated for the correlated electron model in question reproduces the experimental photoemission intensities . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 and are the annihilation operators for an electron in an @xmath27- and @xmath28-directed @xmath29-bonding oxygen orbital , @xmath30 annihilated an electron in the @xmath31 orbital .",
    "+ to that end , let us first consider the problem of a single atom ( which may be either cu or o ) .",
    "the calculation is similar as outlined in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we want to study photoionization , i.e. an optical transition from a localized valence orbital into a scattering state with energy @xmath32 .",
    "the dipole matrix element for light polarized along the unit vector @xmath33 reads : @xmath34 here the initial state is taken to be a cef state with angular momentum @xmath35 and crystal - field label @xmath36 : @xmath37 we consider this state to be ` localized ' , that means the radial wave function @xmath38 is zero outside the atomic radius @xmath39 . for the wave function of the final ( = scattering ) state",
    "we choose : @xmath40 the real functions @xmath38 and @xmath41 both are a solution of the radial schrdinger equation for a suitably chosen atomic potential . the scattering phase @xmath42 and the prefactor @xmath43 are determined by the condition that the wave function @xmath44 and its derivative be continuous at @xmath45 .",
    "details are given in appendix i. we note that the scattering phase @xmath42 also plays an important role in the interpretation of exafs spectra ( where it is usually called the central atom phase shift ) and thus could in principle be determined experimentally ( although at the relatively high photoelectron kinetic energies important for exafs are not ideal for arpes ) .",
    "+ representing the dipole operator as @xmath46 we can rewrite the dipole matrix element as @xmath47 here the radial integral is given by @xmath48 and the following abbreviation for the angular integrals of three spherical harmonics has been introduced : @xmath49 the constants @xmath50 are well - known in the theory of atomic multiplets and tabulated for example in slater s book@xcite . knowing the atomic potential the radial integral and thus the entire matrix element could now in principle be calculated .",
    "+ next , we assume that the radial part of @xmath51 at large distances is decomposed into outgoing and incoming spherical waves . observing the outgoing spherical wave at large distance under a direction defined by the polar angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 , it may locally be approximated by a phase shifted plane wave : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "+ let us next consider an array of identical atoms in the @xmath56-plane of our coordinate system ( which we take to coincide with the cuo@xmath0 plane in all that follows ) . to describe the final state after ejection of an electron from the atom at site @xmath57 we would simply have to replace throughout @xmath58 in the above calculation , where @xmath59 denotes the position of the atom . if we want to give the created photohole a definite in - plane momentum @xmath60 , however , we have to form a coherent superposition of such states , that means weighted by the bloch factors @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the number of atoms in the plane . at the remote distance @xmath63 we consequently replace @xmath64 , leaving the polar angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 unchanged , multiply by @xmath65 and sum over @xmath57 .",
    "+ the photoelectron wave function at @xmath63 then becomes @xmath66 here @xmath67 denotes the projection of @xmath13 onto the @xmath56-plane and @xmath68 is a 2d reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "an important feature of this result is the fact that by creating a photohole with momentum @xmath60 ( which must belong to the first brillouin zone ) the photoelectrons may well be emitted with the 3d momentum @xmath69 , that means the parallel momentum component of the photoelectrons need not be equal to @xmath60 . + summing over all possible partial waves @xmath70 and introducing the abbreviation @xmath71 the electron current per solid angle at @xmath63 due to the in - plane orbitals of the type @xmath72 finally becomes @xmath73 here @xmath62 should be taken equal to the number of unit cells within the sample area illuminated by the photon beam . + after some algebra ( appendix ii ) this can be brought to the form @xmath74 here all the angular dependence on the shape of the original cef - level has been collected in the vectors @xmath75 - it is important to note , that these vectors are obtained by standard angular - momentum recoupling so that the resulting angular dependence is _",
    "exact_. it is only the ` radial matrix elements ' @xmath76 which have to be calculated approximately and thus may be prone to inaccuracies .",
    "+ so far we have limited ourselves to one specific type of orbital in the plane .",
    "if we allow photoemission from any type of orbital we simply have to add up the prefactors of the plane - wave states _ before _ squaring to compute the photocurrent .",
    "+ summarizing the preceding discussion we can conclude that the proper electron annihilation operator to describe the photoemission process would be @xmath77 here @xmath78 denotes the position of the orbital @xmath79 within the unit cell . suppressing the spin and momentum index for simplicity , the total arpes intensity then would be given ( up to an energy and momentum independent prefactor ) by @xmath80 whereas the scalar products @xmath81 take into account the interplay between the real - space shape of the orbitals , the polarization of the incident light and the direction of electron emission , the spectral densities @xmath82 incorporate the possible many - body effects in the cuo@xmath0 planes - we thus have the desired recipe for studying photoemission intensities in the framework of a strong correlation model .",
    "+ to conclude this section we note that we have actually performed only the first stage of the calculation within the so - called three - step model .",
    "we give a brief list of complications that we have neglected : the emission from lower planes than the first and the extinction of the respective photoelectron intensity , any diffraction of the outgoing electron wave function from the surrounding atoms , the refraction of the photoelectrons as they pass the potential step at the surface of the solid .",
    "it is thus quite obvious that our theory is strongly simplified .",
    "we now want to discuss some consequences of the results in the preceding section , thereby using mainly the standard three - band hubbard - model to describe the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "we first consider the noninteracting limit @xmath83 . here",
    "we use a @xmath84-band model which was introduced by andersen _ et al._@xcite to describe the lda bandstructure of yba@xmath0cu@xmath85o@xmath86 .",
    "in addition to the cu 3@xmath31 orbital and the to @xmath29-bonding o @xmath87 orbitals this model includes a cu @xmath88 orbital , which produces the so - called @xmath89 and @xmath90 terms in the single - band model - which are essential to obtain the correct fermi surface topology . suppressing the spin index",
    "the creation operators for single _ electron _ eigenstates read @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the @xmath93 eigenvector of the matrix    @xmath94    2 values of the parameters @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given in ref .",
    "+ if we consider the planar momentum @xmath98 , where @xmath13 is in the first bz and @xmath99 is a reciprocal lattice vector , the photoemission intensity for the @xmath93 band becomes @xmath100 using this we proceed to a detailed comparison with the work of bansil and lindroos@xcite .",
    "these authors have performed an extensive first - principles study of the arpes intensities in bi2212 , thereby using the more realistic one - step model of photoemission and a complete surface band - structure , both for the initial and final state wave function . amongst others , bansil and lindroos studied the variation of the peak - weight along the fermi surface for given direction of the polarization vector @xmath33 .",
    "their results are shown in figure [ bansilcomp ] and compared to the above theory .",
    "obviously the overall trends seen by bansil and lindroos are reproduced reasonably well by the present theory and we want to give a brief discussion of the mechanisms which lead to these trends .",
    "+ to begin with , it is to simplest approximation the ` oxygen content ' of the wave function , which determines the arpes intensity .",
    "this is not so much due to the smallness of the radial matrix elements for cu ( which are quite comparable to the ones for oxygen , see the appendix ) , but rather the fact that the partial waves emitted by a @xmath31 orbital produce virtually no intensity close to the surface normal ( as will be shown below ) .    for an electron energy of @xmath101 the detector would have to be placed at @xmath102 degrees from the surface normal ( neglecting the refraction by the potential step at the surface ) , and the @xmath31 orbital emits practically no electrons into this direction .",
    "+ next we note that light polarized along the @xmath103direction can only excite electrons from @xmath104-type orbitals , light polarized along the @xmath15 direction will excite the combination @xmath105 , whereas light polarized along @xmath106 excites @xmath107 .",
    "finally one has to bear in mind that near @xmath108 the tight - binding wave function contains only @xmath104-type orbitals ( the mixing between @xmath109 and @xmath110 being exactly zero )",
    ". therefore the polarizations @xmath15 and @xmath106 have equal intensity , whereas @xmath103 gives maximum intensity . near @xmath111",
    "in the other hand , the tight - binding wave function contains only @xmath112 , whence the polarizations @xmath15 and @xmath106 again have equal intensity , whereas @xmath103 this time gives no intensity . for @xmath113 exciting @xmath105",
    "gives no intensity , because this combination does not mix with @xmath31 and hence is not contained in the tight - binding wave function , whereas exciting @xmath107 gives high intensity .",
    "the intensity for polarization @xmath103 at these momenta is approximately @xmath114 of that for @xmath108 .",
    "these simple considerations obviously explain the overall shape of the curves in figure [ bansilcomp ] quite well .",
    "the main discrepancy between the bansil - lindroos theory and our calculation is the behaviour of the curve for polarization @xmath106 . actually , this is the only curve which is not determined by symmetry alone , and subtle details of the wave function become important .",
    "we believe that the parameterization of andersen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite does give the correct dispersion , but not necessarily the right wave functions .",
    "next we consider the intensity variation along various high - symmetry lines in the brillouin zone , shown in figure [ bansilcomp2 ] .",
    "again , there is reasonable agreement between bansil and lindroos and our theory .",
    "all in all the comparison shows that also in the results of bansil and lindroos the behaviour of the intensity is to a considerable extent determined by the ` radiation characteristics ' of the orbitals in the cuo@xmath0 plane and the relative weight of the @xmath104 and @xmath112 orbitals .",
    "additional complications like multiple scattering of the photoelectrons , bragg scattering from the bio surface layer etc . do not seem to have a very strong impact on the intensity variations , not even at the relatively low photon energy of @xmath115 . despite its simplicity",
    "we therefore believe that our theory has some merit , particularly so because it allows ( unlike the single particle calculation of bansil and lindroos ) to incorporate the effects of strong correlations .",
    "one weak point of all single - particle - like calculations for the cuo@xmath0-plane is the following : since ( in electron language ) the band which forms the fermi surface is the topmost one obtained by mixing the energetically higher cu 3@xmath31-orbital with the energetically lower o 2p@xmath29 orbitals it is clear , that the respective wave functions have predominant cu 3@xmath31 character .",
    "this is exactly opposite to the actual situation in the cuprates , where the fist ionization states in the doped and undoped case are known to have predominant o 2p character .",
    "we now consider the case of large @xmath116 .",
    "an exact calculation of the single - particle spectra ( [ resolv ] ) is no longer possible in this case and we have to use various approximations .",
    "first we study an isolated zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) in a single cuo@xmath86 plaquette , see figure [ plaqu ] .",
    "the bonding combination of @xmath1 @xmath22-orbitals is @xmath117 and the single - hole basis states ( relevant at half - filling ) can be written as @xmath118 here @xmath119 denotes the @xmath120 state .",
    "the single hole ground state then is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the normalized ground state eigenvector of the matrix @xmath123 two - hole states are obtained by starting from the basis states @xmath124 the two - hole ground state of the plaquette reads @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is an eigenvector of @xmath127 if we want to make contact with the @xmath128 model , where a ` hole ' at site @xmath129 stands for a zrs in the plaquette centered on the copper site @xmath129 , we have to incorporate a phase factor of @xmath130 , into the definition of @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the position of the central cu orbital . in other words ,",
    "the matrix element for the creation of a ` hole ' in the @xmath128 model is @xmath133 the matrix elements for the creation of @xmath134 and @xmath135 are @xmath136 finally , the matrix element for creation of a zrs from the single - hole ground state becomes @xmath137 using this expression , the intensity expected for a zrs with momentum @xmath13 can be calculated as a function of photon polarization and energy .",
    "this will be discussed in the next sections .",
    "+    = 6.0 cm    in comparing the intensities calculated from our above theory for a single zrs to experiment one would be implicitly assuming that the first ionization states can be described completely by a coherent superposition of zrs _ in a single plaquette_. this need not be the case and in order to get at least a rough feeling for the effects of ` embedding the plaquette in a lattice ' we use the technique of cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) to study the extended system .",
    "cpt , which was first suggested by senechal _",
    "et al._@xcite , is a technique to ` extrapolate ' the single - electron s green s function calculated on a finite cluster to an infinite periodic system .",
    "it is based on an perturbative treatment of the intercluster hopping .",
    "the cluster we used for the present calculation is a quadratic arrangement of four unit cells each containing one cu d@xmath138 and two o p@xmath139 orbitals as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the green s function @xmath140 of this cluster with open boundary conditions is calculated by the lanczos method .",
    "the boundary orbitals of the cluster are connected to the adjacent cluster by the fourier transform of the intercluster hopping @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is a `` superlattice '' wave - vector restricted to the smaller brillouin zone formed by the now enlarged lattice of the clusters .",
    "the perturbative treatment of the intercluster hopping in lowest order yields an rpa like expression for the approximate green s function .",
    "@xmath143 this mixed representation can then be transformed into momentum space by a fourier transformation thereby taking into account the geometry of the cluster : @xmath144 this result is exact for @xmath83 and has been shown@xcite to produce good results also for large and intermediate @xmath116 . in the following sections we will use this technique for the approximate calculation of the single - particle spectral densities as a valuable cross - check for the calculations based on a single zrs .",
    "while cpt still is far from being rigorous , it includes some effects which result from embedding the zrs in a lattice and , as we will in fact see , it always gives results which are very similar to those for a zrs .",
    "+ to conclude this section we want to give a simple estimate for the photoelectron kinetic energy @xmath145 as a function of photon energy @xmath146 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the absence of any potential step at the surface of the solid we would have @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the energy of the ground state of the solid with @xmath62 electrons and @xmath149 the final state of the solid .",
    "we approximate @xmath150 here @xmath151 are the ground state energies of a cuo@xmath86 plaquette with @xmath152 holes , obtained by diagonalizing the matrices ( [ singleham ] ) and ( [ doubleham ] ) . in these matrices",
    "the energy of the @xmath153 level , @xmath154 , has been chosen as the zero of energy , whence it has to be taken into account separately .",
    "for the ` standard values ' of the parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 this gives @xmath158 .",
    "using the estimate @xmath159 from our atomic lda calculation we find @xmath160 which we will use in all that follows .",
    "+    as a first application , figure [ bansilcomp4 ] then shows the intensity of the topmost arpes peak calculated by cpt and compares this to experimental data .",
    "reasonable qualitative agreement can be found , especially for the cpt calculation , although the shift of the spectral weight maximum towards @xmath161 for @xmath115 is not reproduced .",
    "the much better agreement for @xmath162 suggests that for the lower photon energy of @xmath115 additional effects ( such as multiple scattering corrections or bragg - scattering from the bio top - layer ) are more important .",
    "coming back to the theory for the zrs we can already draw conclusions of some importance . by combining the expressions for the vectors @xmath75 from appendix ii with the ` form factor ' of a zrs , ( [ zrsform ] ) , the expression for the photocurrent can be brought to the form @xmath163 we remember that @xmath60 is the momentum of the photohole ( which is within the first brillouin zone of the cuo@xmath0 plane ) , whereas @xmath13 is the momentum of the escaping photoelectron . using the expressions from appendix ii it is now a matter of straightforward algebra to derive the following expressions for @xmath164 , and the ` optimal ' photon polarization for momenta along @xmath103 , @xmath165 : @xmath166 figure [ char ] shows the @xmath167-dependence of these expressions .",

    "this may in fact explain a well - known@xcite effect in arpes , namely the the relatively strong asymmetry with respect to @xmath108 of the arpes intensity for @xmath60 along @xmath103 which    is seen at @xmath115 photon energy but not at @xmath176 .",

    "+ we first consider the case of normal incidence of the light , that means the electric field vector @xmath33 is in the cuo@xmath0 plane . rotating @xmath33 in the plane will change the intensity from the zrs - derived states in a systematic way , and for some angle @xmath180 it will be maximum . along high symmetry directions like @xmath15 or @xmath103 the optimal polarization can be deduced by symmetry considerations , because the zrs has a definite parity under reflections by these directions . for momenta @xmath13 along",

    "we note that apart from merely enhancing the intensity of the zrs , knowledge of the polarization dependence of the arpes intensity of the ` ideal ' zrs would allow also to separate the original signal from zrs - derived states from any ` background ' , that means photoelectrons which have undergone inelastic scattering on their way to the analyzer",
    ". since it is plausible that these background electrons have more or less lost the information about the polarization of the incoming light , their contribution should be insensitive to polarization .",
    "taking the spectrum at the ` optimal angle ' for the zrs and perpendicular to it then would allow to remove the background by merely subtracting the two spectra ( provided one can measure the absolute intensity ) .",

    "this means that in practice one could adjust the polarization angle @xmath180 once to either @xmath193 or @xmath184 , and then scan an entire straight line through the origin by varying the emission angle @xmath52 without having to change the polarization along the way .",
    "figures [ max - zrs ] and [ max - cpt ] then show the optimal angle for observation of the first ionization state for momenta in the first brillouin zone . for perpendicular polarization",
    "the intensity practically vanishes . in the figure we compare the ` isolated zrs ' and",

    "+ next , moving to a higher brillouin zone allows to enhance the intensity of the zrs , as can be seen from table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the ratio @xmath194 of the intensity obtainable by measuring the zrs at @xmath168 at the ` original position ' ( there the polarization has to be perpendicular to ( 1,1 ) by symmetry ) and the intensity that can be obtained by measuring in a higher zone with optimized polarization , both within in the cuo@xmath0 plane and , for later reference , also out of plane .",
    "the same information is given for @xmath108 in table [ table2 ] .",
    "obviously , an enhancement of a factor of @xmath195 or more can be achieved by proper choice of the experimental conditions . in view of the large ` background ' in the experimental spectra",
    ", even such a moderate enhancement may be quite important .",
    "+ we note that the physical origin of the variation of intensity with @xmath180 and order of the brillouin zone    is the interference between the processes of creating a photohole in @xmath104-like and @xmath112-like @xmath1 @xmath22 orbitals . by changing @xmath180 the relative intensity and phase between photoholes in the two types of orbitals can be tuned .",
    "thus , one can always find an angle @xmath193 where the interference between these two types of orbital is maximally constructive .",
    "this angle depends on the relative phase between the two orbitals in the wave function and thus is specific for the state in question .",
    "next , we study a quite different effect , namely what happens if we tilt the polarization vector @xmath33 out of the cuo@xmath0 plane . to illustrate the usefulness of this , we again consider a momentum along the high symmetry line @xmath196 and assume that the polarization vector @xmath33 is within in @xmath197 plane it follows from symmetry considerations that any component of the light perpendicular to this plane ( ` s - polarization ' ) can not excite any zrs - derived states .",
    "in other words we assume that @xmath180 but that @xmath198 is variable .",

    "clearly , this enhances the intensity at intermediate @xmath52 , particularly so if constructive interference with the @xmath31 and @xmath204 harmonics ( which are excited by the @xmath27-component of @xmath33 ) occurs .",
    "since the @xmath202 on one hand and the @xmath31 and @xmath204 on the other have opposite parity under reflection by the @xmath205 plane , constructive interference for some momentum @xmath206 automatically implies destructive interference for momentum @xmath207 . tilting the electric field out of the plane thus amounts to ` focusing ' the photoelectrons towards the detector .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ focus2 ] , which shows the angular variation within the @xmath208 plane of the photocurrent radiated by a zrs .",
    "figure [ thetascan ] then shows the intensity as a function of @xmath198 for various momenta along @xmath196 .",
    "remarkably enough , the enhancement of current towards the detector may be up to a factor of @xmath209 as compared to polarization in the plane .",
    "exploiting this effect could enhance the photoemission intensity considerably in the region around @xmath108 - which might be important , because this is precisely the ` controversial ' region in @xmath13-space which makes the difference between hole - like@xcite and electron - like@xcite fermi surface in bi2212 and where bilayer - splitting@xcite should be observable .",
    "one _ caveat _ is the fact , that for a polarization which is not in the plane one has to compute the actual field direction by use of the fresnel formulae@xcite .",
    "the value of the dielectric constant , however , which has to be chosen for such a calculation , is very close to @xmath210 .",
    "tables i and ii also give the optimal angles @xmath198 and @xmath180 for observing @xmath168 and @xmath108 in higher brillouin zones . obviously , by choosing the right zone and the right polarization a considerable enhancement of the intensity can be achieved .",
    "we have seen in the preceding sections that the orbitals from which the zrs is built emit photoelectrons predominantly at grazing angles with respect to the cuo@xmath0 plane ( see figure [ char ] ) . in most cases electrons emitted with momentum @xmath211 will be simply ` lost ' because they will not reach a detector positioned to collect electrons with momentum @xmath212 ( it might happen that the photoelectron ` gets rid of its @xmath68 ' by bragg - scattering at the bio surface layer - a possibility which we are neglecting here ) .",
    "it may happen , however , that the motion with momentum @xmath213 parallel to the surface ` consumes so much energy ' that there is hardly any energy left for the motion perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this will happen whenever the kinetic energy @xmath145 is just above the so - called emergence condition for the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath68 : @xmath214 in other words : the kinetic energy is ` just about sufficient ' to create a free electron state with 3d momentum @xmath215 . in this case",
    "the energy available for motion perpendicular to the surface is not sufficient for the photoelectron to surmount the energy barrier at the surface and it will be reflected back in to the solid . +",
    "on the other hand , if the ` perpendicular energy ' is below the energy of the hubbard gap as well , the electron can not re - enter the solid either , because there are no single - particle states available in the solid with the proper energy .",
    "the situation thus is quite analogous to the case of the so - called shockley state seen on the cu surface : a combination of surface potential and a gap in the single - particle dos causes the electron to be trapped at the surface of the solid . for an extensive review of the properties of such so - called surface resonances",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "+ the existence of such surface resonances also in a cuprate - related material has been established by pothuizen@xcite . in an extensive eels study of sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 , pothuizen",
    "could in fact identify not just one , but a total of @xmath209 such states ( in some cases with clearly resolved dispersion ) in the energy window @xmath216 .",
    "his results show very clearly that such surface states do exist in sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 - whether this holds true for other cuprate materials has not been established yet , but for the moment we will take their existence for granted .",
    "+ to proceed in at least a semiquantitative way we use a very simple approximation@xcite .",
    "we decompose the potential felt by an electron at the surface as @xmath217 ( @xmath218 denotes the planar lattice constant ) and assume that @xmath219 can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the eigenstates of an electron in the potential @xmath220 can be factorized : @xmath221 with corresponding energy @xmath222 a surface resonance would correspond to a @xmath223 which is localized around the surface .",
    "+ let us now consider the subspace of eigenstates of @xmath224 which comprises + a ) the ( discrete ) surface resonance state @xmath225 and + b ) the continuum of states @xmath226 which evolve into plane waves with momentum @xmath227 asymptotically far away from the surface . the periodic surface potential ( i.e. the term @xmath219 ) then provides a mechanism for mixing @xmath225 and the continuum",
    "moreover , dipole transitions of an electron from the valence band into both a continuum state and into the surface resonance ( whereby the latter alternative is possibly even more probable due to the special radiation characteristics of a zrs ) are possible .",
    "we thus have all ingredients for the standard fano - type resonance ( see figure [ fano ] ) and we would thus expect a pronounced peak    in an intensity - versus - photon - energy curve whenever the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons approximately matches the energy of a surface resonance . neglecting the ( presumably small ) energy @xmath228 this will happen when the kinetic energy @xmath145 obeys the emergence condition ( [ emergence ] ) for some @xmath68 . + a strong oscillation of the intensity of the zrs - derived first ionization states at @xmath229 and @xmath230 in sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 as a function of photon energy has indeed been found recently by drr _ at al._@xcite .",
    "their data show a total of four maxima of intensity in the photon - energy range @xmath231 .",
    "much unlike the absorption cross section oscillations seen in exafs , these maxima are separated by near - zeroes of the intensity for certain photon energies .",
    "+ one interpretation which might come to mind would be interference between the directly emitted electron wave and partial waves which have been reflected from neighboring atoms , similar as the variations in absorption cross section seen in exafs .",
    "if we neglect the energy dependence of the scattering phase shift at the hypothetical scatterers , the difference @xmath173 in pathlength between the interfering partial waves would then obey @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the free electron wavevector at the @xmath93 maximum of intensity . from the four maxima observed by drr _ at al .",
    "_ at @xmath230 , one obtains three estimates for @xmath173 : @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 @xmath237",
    ". this is in any case much longer than the cu - o bond length of @xmath195 @xmath237 .",
    "the only ` natural length ' in sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 which would give a comparable distance is the distance between the two inequivalent cuo@xmath0 planes , which is @xmath238 @xmath237 .",
    "one might therefore be tempted to explain the oscillation as being due to electrons from the topmost cuo@xmath0 plane being reflected at the first cuo@xmath0 plane below .",
    "this would give a difference in pathway of approximately @xmath239 @xmath237 , the discrepancy with the values given above could possibly be explained by an energy dependence of the phase shift upon reflection . on the other hand",
    "it is quite obvious that the reflected wave , having to travel a total of @xmath239 @xmath237 through the interior of the solid and having undergone one reflection , would have a considerably smaller amplitude than the primary wave . in this picture",
    "it is then hard to explain why the intensity at the minima is so close to zero .",
    "we therefore believe that interference is the correct explanation of the strong oscillations .",
    "+ let us assume on the other hand , that the maxima are due to fano - resonances of the type discussed above . as already mentioned above , we would expect a surface resonance state to form whenever the emergence condition ( [ emergence ] ) is fulfilled approximately for some reciprocal lattice vector @xmath68 .",
    "as a rough approximation , we moreover assume that the probability for the dipole transition from the cuo@xmath0 plane into the surface resonance state is proportional the ` transition matrix element ' @xmath240 into a plane wave state with momentum @xmath241 . neglecting the form of the fano lineshape ( which would be hard to compute anyway because we do not know the fourier coefficients of the potential @xmath219 )",
    "we then expect an energy dependence of the intensity to be roughly given by @xmath242 actually injection into the surface state should be possible if the kinetic energy is in a narrow window above the emergence condition , whence for simplicity we replace the @xmath243-functions by lorentzians .",
    "figure [ duerrcomp ] then compares this simple estimate to the data of drr _ at al._@xcite .",
    "thereby we have again assumed that @xmath244 . the agreement with experiment is satisfactory , given the rather crude nature of our estimate for the intensity .",
    "given the fact that surface resonances in sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 have been established conclusively by the eels - work of pothuizen@xcite we believe that the present interpretation of the intensity variations is the most plausible one .",
    "the question to whether such surface resonance states exist also in metallic bi2212 must be clarified by experiment .",
    "let us now consider what happens in the above picture if we vary the in - plane momentum @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to notice from the outset , that the group velocity of the surface state , @xmath245 , is much larger than that of the valence band .",
    "thus , if we shift the valence band ` upwards ' by the photon energy @xmath146 , this replica and the surface state my intersect the surface resonance dispersion at some momentum ( see figure [ pseudo ] ) . note that here the binding energy of the o2p level must be incorporated into the valence band energy .",
    "for each @xmath60 we now assume that the fano - type interference between the surface resonance state and the continuum occurs .",
    "the maximum of the resonance curve thereby will roughly follow the dispersion of the surface state . in an arpes experiment",
    "we then obviously probe the intensity along the fano - curve at an energy which corresponds to the shifted valence band ( see figure [ pseudo ] ) .",
    "obviously this leads to a drastic variation of the observed photoelectron intensity : at the @xmath60 labeled 1 , the point where the resonance curve is probed is on the ascending side of the resonance , whence we observe a moderately large    intensity . at the second momentum , we are right at the maximum of the respective fano - resonance , so the intensity will be high . at the momentum labeled 3 , however , we are already at the minimum of the fano - resonance , where the intensity is approximately zero .",
    "we thus would observe a dramatic drop in the observed intensity over a relatively small distance @xmath246 in the @xmath60-plane .",
    "more precisely , the sharpness of the drop is determined by the width @xmath247 of the fano - curve and the difference @xmath248 in group velocity between the valence band and the surface resonance state : @xmath249 .",
    "+ to be more quantitative , we present a simple model calculation of the arpes spectra to be expected in the presence of a free - electron - like surface resonance .",
    "we label the surface resonance state as @xmath250 and the continuum of leed states by their ` perpendicular ' momentum : @xmath251 .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath252 we assume that the vacuum consists of a volume spanned by @xmath253 planar unit cells and thickness @xmath254 perpendicular to the surface .",
    "we write the mixing matrix element as @xmath255 so as to explicitly isolate the scaling of the matrix elements with @xmath254 .",
    "@xmath256 should be independent of @xmath254 and since we assume it to be independent of @xmath257 we may also assume it to be real .",
    "+ we then obtain the resolvent operator @xmath258 here @xmath259 and @xmath260 have the dimension of energy and frequency , respectively ; only one of them can be chosen independently , we choose @xmath261 whence @xmath259 is a measure for the strength of the mixing between surface resonance and continuum . + a possible final state obtained by dipole transition of an electron from the valence band then is @xmath262 where we have again explicitly isolated the scaling of the transition matrix elements with @xmath254 .",
    "both matrix elements are assumed to be real .",
    "the measured intensity then becomes @xmath263 where we have introduced @xmath264 .",
    "taking into account the dispersion of the initial state as well as its finite lifetime ( which we describe by a lorentzian broadening @xmath265 ) we approximate the measured spectrum for some momentum @xmath60 as @xmath266 a simulated arpes spectrum is then shown in figure [ fanodisp ] . for simplicity we have chosen @xmath267 to be the simple sdw - like dispersion @xmath268 with @xmath269 .",
    "it has been assumed that this band is completely filled , that means we would not have any true fermi surface at all . despite this , the arpes spectra , which is simulated by using ( [ arpesspec ] ) shows a sharp drop in intensity at the intersection of the surface state dispersion @xmath270 shifted downward by the photon energy . here",
    "@xmath271 .",
    "the photon energy in the above example has been chosen deliberately such that the surface state dispersion cuts through the quasiparticle dispersion near the top of the latter , so as to produce the impression of a fermi surface .",
    "usually this would happen only by coincidence for very few photon energies . at this point",
    "is has to be remembered , however , that the dispersion of the valence band in cuprate superconductors seems to show an extended region with practically no dispersion in the region around @xmath108 .",
    "this band portion moreover is energetically immediately below the chemical potential .",
    "the almost complete lack of dispersion in this region then makes it necessary to rely mostly on ` intensity drops ' of the valence band in assigning a fermi surface , and it is quite obvious that whenever the surface state dispersion , shifted downward by the photon energy , happens to cut through the flat - band region for the photon energy in question , the resulting drop in intensity will be almost indistinguishable from a true fermi surface . to illustrate this effect we have calculated the intensity within a window of @xmath272 below @xmath273 for the ` standard ' dispersion with an extended van - hove singularity@xcite @xmath274 which ( for @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 ) produces the well - known ` @xmath115-fermi surface ' , together with the ` flat bands ' around @xmath108 .",
    "the constant @xmath278 incorporates a constant shift due to the binding energy of the o 2p orbitals .",
    "figures [ denplo ] then shows the integrated intensity in a window of @xmath272 below the fermi energy - a plot which is by now a standard method to discuss fermi surfaces . in figure [ denplo]a the fano - curve @xmath279 in ( [ arpesspec ] )",
    "is replaced by unity , and we see the expected spectral weight map in which the fermi surface can be clearly identified .    the latter is shown in figure [ denplo]b . in figure [ denplo]c , on the other hand , we have included the fano curve @xmath279 for the surface state with @xmath280 ( assuming a free 2d - electron dispersion with lattice constant @xmath281 ) and a kinetic energy of @xmath282 .",
    "the corresponding constant energy - contour @xmath283 is also shown in figure [ circles ] .",
    "one can see quite clearly then , that the contour attenuates the true fermi surface on its ` backside ' and strongly enhances the intensity at its ` frontside ' thus creating the rather perfect impression of a fermi surface arc which intersects the @xmath103 direction at approximately @xmath284 .",
    "on the other hand in our model the true fermi surface is the one seen in figure [ denplo]a .",
    "the combination of fano resonance and flat band portion near @xmath108 thus produces an ` apparent fermi surface ' which is entirely artificial . + to compare with experimental data in more detail , we recall that upon neglecting the dispersion of the valence band state as compared to that of the surface resonance , the momenta in the @xmath60-plane where intersections as the one in figure [ pseudo ] occur have to obey the equation @xmath285 where @xmath145 denotes the kinetic energy of the ejected electron . in other words :",
    "the resonant enhancement of the arpes intensity occurs along a constant energy contour of the surface resonance dispersion .",
    "if we stick to our free - electron approximation , these are simply circles in the @xmath60-plane centered on @xmath286 .",
    "figure [ circles ] then shows these contours for two different photon energies , namely @xmath115 and @xmath287 .",
    "thereby we have again assumed that @xmath288 .",
    "also shown is the standard ` fermi surface ' , determined at @xmath115 .",
    "it is then obvious that the ` @xmath115-fermi surface ' always is close to some portion of a surface resonance contour .",
    "this would imply that for this photon energy most potions of the fermi surface could be enhanced - it might also be taken to suggest , however , that some fermi surface portions near @xmath108 are actually artificial .",
    "it is hard to give a more detailed discussion , because even slight deviations from the free electron dispersion for the surface resonance will have a major impact on the energy contours . for @xmath176 , on the other hand , the fermi surface obviously is ` cut off ' near @xmath108 by the contour for @xmath289 .",
    "the fermi surface seen at @xmath176 then might be obtained by following the true fermi contour ( dashed line ) until the intersection with the @xmath290-contour , and then following the latter ( where the arpes intensity is high due to the resonance effect and the fact there are states immediately below @xmath5 due to the flat band around @xmath108 ) . in this way",
    "one would obtain a ` fermi contour ' which is quite similar to the one actually observed at @xmath176 . for even higher photon energy",
    "there are too many @xmath99 s which contribute their own circles , so that one can not give a meaningful discussion .",
    "the question which of the different fermi surface portions observed in bi2212 are artificial and which are real clearly needs a detailed experimental study .",
    "a very simple way would be to vary the photon energy in small steps of ( e.g. ) @xmath291 , in which case one should observe a continuous drift of the ` fermi surface ' for those parts which are artificial .",
    "unfortunately the present understanding of surface resonances in cuprate materials is much too rudimentary to make any theoretical prediction . not even knowing any details of their dispersion , we have to content ourselves with the very much oversimplified model calculations outlined above to show what might happen .",
    "even these simple model calculations do show rather clearly , however , that simply plotting intensity maps near @xmath273 or identifying ` fermi surface crossings ' near @xmath108 by drops of spectral weight is not really an adequate means to clarify this issue .",
    "in summary , we have presented a discussion of arpes intensities from the cuo@xmath0 plane . thereby we could actually address only a few ( but hopefully the most important ) aspects of the problem . + to begin with",
    ", the geometry of the orbitals , which form the first ionization states of the cuo@xmath0 plane , leads to a pronounced anisotropy of the photoelectron current .",
    "this makes itself felt in a strong dependence of the intensity on the polarization of the incoming light .",
    "this may be exploited to enhance the intensity seen in an arpes experiment by choosing appropriate photon polarization or going to a higher brillouin zone .",
    "we have presented a simple model to guess ` optimized ' values of the polarization and the brillouin zone to obtain maximum intensity for a given @xmath292-point .",
    "+ moreover there is a strong preference for a zhang - rice singlet to emit photoelectrons at small angles relative to the plane .",
    "this in turn may lead to a injection of the photoelectrons into states located at the surface of the sample , so - called surface resonances .",
    "such surface resonances are well - established in at least one cuprate - related material , namely sr@xmath0cucl@xmath0o@xmath0 . we have proposed to explain the pronounced photon - energy dependence of the arpes intensities in this material by these surface resonances .",
    "next , we have presented a simple model calculation which shows how such surface resonances may lead to apparent fermi surfaces in the flat - band region around @xmath108 .",
    "this may be one explanation for the apparently different fermi surface topology seen in bi2212 at @xmath115 and at @xmath176 , possibly also in an interplay with bilayer - splitting@xcite . in any case",
    "the existence or non - existence of surface - resonances should be clarified experimentally , since the identification of any major fermi surface portion near @xmath108 as being ` artificial ' amy have major implications for our understanding of cuprate materials .",
