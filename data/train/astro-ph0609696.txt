    "lensed quasars due to foreground galaxy clusters probe the distribution of dark matter in the lens objects @xcite , and their statistics can be an useful test of dark matter models @xcite .",
    "a continuing problem , however , is the limited number of strongly lensed quasars ( approximately 100 , * ? ? ? * ) and the still more limited number found in systematic surveys . in particular ,",
    "the current largest completed survey , the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , led to a well - defined statistical sample of only 13 lensed radio sources .",
    "while the class survey can be used to obtain constraints on dark energy @xcite , larger well - defined lens samples are needed to be competitive with other approaches to constraining the cosmological model .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is currently the best candidate for building a larger , well - defined lensed quasar sample than the class .",
    "the sdss is expected to eventually provide a catalog of roughly @xmath6 spectroscopically identified quasars @xcite , which we have been searching for gravitationally lensed quasars in the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the probability of a quasar being multiply imaged is of order @xmath7 @xcite , we have a reasonable expectation of obtaining a well - defined sample of roughly 100 lensed quasars .",
    "including the two new lenses reported here , we have now discovered 18 new lensed quasars @xcite , and recovered 8 previously known lensed quasars @xcite , making the sqls the largest survey for gravitational lensed quasars to date .    in this paper",
    ", we present two new doubly - imaged lensed quasars found in the course of the sqls , sdss j074653.03 + 440351.3 ( sdss j0746 + 4403 ) and sdss j140624.82 + 612640.9 ( sdss j1406 + 6126 ) . they were confirmed with the observations at the w. m. keck observatory s keck ii telescope , the university of hawaii 2.2-meter ( uh88 ) telescope , and the mdm observatory s 2.4-m hiltner ( mdm 2.4-m ) telescope .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our lens candidate selection from the sdss data in  [ sec : sdss ] .",
    "the results of the imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations for sdss j0746 + 4403 and sdss j1406 + 6126 are presented in  [ sec:0746 ] and",
    " [ sec:1406 ] , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : model ] discusses the models of the lensed quasars and we summarize our results in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume a cosmological model with matter density @xmath8 , cosmological constant @xmath9 , and hubble constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the sdss consists of a photometric survey @xcite in five broad - band optical filters @xcite and a spectroscopic survey with a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 at a resolution of @xmath11 , both using a dedicated wide - field ( @xmath12 field of view ) 2.5-m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa . the final survey area is about 10,000 square degrees of the sky approximately centered on the north galactic cap .",
    "once the imaging data is processed by the photometric pipeline @xcite , quasar and galaxy candidates are selected for spectroscopy @xcite and the spectroscopic observations are conducted according to the tiling algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the imaging data has an astrometric accuracy better than about @xmath13 rms per coordinate @xcite and photometric zeropoint errors less than about 0.03 magnitude over the entire survey area @xcite .",
    "the sdss is continuously releasing the data to the public @xcite .",
    "the two objects , sdss j0746 + 4403 and sdss j1406 + 6126 , were selected as lensed quasar candidates from the sample of the sdss spectroscopically confirmed quasars by two algorithms . the first method is the algorithm we used previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which identifies close separation ( @xmath1410 ) lens candidates as quasars with low probabilities of being well fit as a point source , an exponential disk or a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the second is the new algorithm introduced by @xcite that examines close pairs of objects ( quasars ) ; both candidates also satisfy the new morphological selection criteria .",
    "we note that sdss j1406 + 6126 with @xmath15 ( @xmath16-band point - spread function magnitude corrected for galactic extinction ) is slightly fainter than the magnitude limit we are using to construct our statistical lens sample ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    figure  [ fig : findingchart ] shows the sdss @xmath16-band images of sdss j0746 + 4403 and sdss j1406 + 6126 . the total magnitudes inside a @xmath17 aperture radius ( without galactic extinction corrections ) and the quasar redshifts from the sdss imaging and spectroscopic data are summarized in table  [ tab : sdss ] .",
    "both objects are marginally resolved in the sdss imaging data and ( spatially ) unresolved in the sdss spectroscopic data , thus additional observations were needed to confirm that they are indeed gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "we obtained @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath20-band images of sdss j0746 + 4403 with the 8k mosaic ccd camera ( uh8k , 0235 pixels ) and the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic , 0137 pixels ) at the uh88 telescope .",
    "we also obtained a deep @xmath21-band image with the retractable optical camera for monitoring ( retrocam , 0259 pixels , * ? ? ? * ) at the mdm 2.4-m telescope .",
    "the observations were conducted on 2004 december 14 ( uh8k-@xmath18 , 07 seeing , 240 sec ) , 2004 december 16 ( uh8k-@xmath19 and -@xmath20 , 08 seeing , 360 and 270 sec ) , 2006 february 23 ( retrocam-@xmath21 , 10 seeing , 2700 sec ) , and 2006 may 3 ( optic-@xmath20 , 10 seeing , 300 sec ) . in all these images , which are shown in the left column of figure  [ fig:0746img ] ,",
    "we observe two stellar components ( denoted as a and b ; a being the eastern component ) with a separation of @xmath22 .",
    "the middle column of figure  [ fig:0746img ] shows the residuals after fitting the images using _ only _ two point spread functions ( psfs ) constructed from nearby stars . in each case",
    ", there are significant , extended residual fluxes ( named g ) , particularly in the redder bands .",
    "the most natural interpretation is that they come from a lens galaxy .",
    "the right column of figure  [ fig:0746img ] shows the residuals after using galfit @xcite to fit the data with two psfs and an extended galaxy ( modeled by a srsic profile ) between them . with the addition of a galaxy , the residuals are indistinguishable from noise .",
    "a and b have very similar colors , while g has much redder colors ( see table  [ tab:0746ap ] ) that are similar to those of an early - type galaxy at @xmath230.20.5 @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xmath20-band magnitude of @xmath24  mag for a lens galaxy at @xmath25 producing the observed separation @xcite agrees well with the observed magnitude of @xmath26  mag .",
    "the relative astrometry of the components ( from the optic @xmath20-band image ) and the absolute photometry for the uh8k @xmath27-band observations are summarized in table  [ tab:0746ap ] .",
    "the magnitudes are calibrated using the standard star pg 0231 + 051 @xcite .",
    "we obtained 1200  sec spectra of components a and b with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the mit - ll 2048@xmath284096 ccd detector at the keck ii telescope on 2006 march 5 ( @xmath29 seeing ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 3900 to 11,000 with a spectral dispersion of @xmath30  pixel@xmath31 .",
    "the spatial sampling scale of the ccd detector is @xmath32 pixel@xmath31 and we used a @xmath33 wide slit aligned to observe components a and b simultaneously . since the spectra of the two components were well - separated in the spectral ccd image , we were able to extract the spectra of the two quasars using standard iraf tasks .",
    "we calibrated the spectra using the spectroscopic standard g191-b2b @xcite , and the telluric lines were corrected using a high resolution model of the absorption bands derived from esi observations of standard stars .",
    "the binned spectra of components a and b , whose bad pixels and bad columns were corrected by liner interpolation , are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:0746spec ] , and the ratio of the spectra is shown in the lower panel .",
    "the spectral flux ratios of both the continuum and the , , , and emission lines are remarkably similar , with an overall flux ratio of @xmath34 . as reported in table  [ tab:0746em ] , the quasar redshifts and emission line - widths are consistent with the hypothesis that the spectra are identical .",
    "since it was obvious that a galaxy is associated with the quasar sdss j1406 + 6126 even in the sdss images , we acquired a short 90 sec exposure uh8k @xmath18-band image on 2005 may 7 ( 08 seeing ) in order to see if there are multiple stellar ( quasar ) images . as shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig:1406img ] , it turned out that the object consists of two stellar components ( named components a and b , with a being the brighter component ) and an extended object ( component g ) between them .",
    "we obtained a deeper and higher spatial resolution @xmath20-band image with the optic camera on 2006 may 3 ( 10 seeing , 300 sec ) , which is also shown in the left column of figure  [ fig:1406img ] .",
    "we again find that the residuals using a fit consisting of only 2 psfs are significant ( the middle column of figure  [ fig:1406img ] ) , while a model consisting of two psfs plus an extended component fits the images well ( the right column of figure  [ fig:1406img ] ) .",
    "the observed color of component g ( @xmath35 ) is also typical of an early - type galaxy at the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath36 that we discuss later in this section @xcite .",
    "the relative astrometry from the optic @xmath20-band image and the absolute photometry from the uh8k @xmath18-band and optic @xmath20-band images for components a , b , and g are summarized in table  [ tab:1406ap ] .",
    "the photometric calibration was done using the standard stars pg 1047 + 003 and pg 1633 + 099 @xcite .",
    "the angular separation of components a and b is @xmath37 .",
    "we obtained a 1200  sec spectrum of sdss j1406 + 6126 on the same night the spectra of sdss j0746 + 443 were acquired , using the same instrumental set up and observing method .",
    "components b and g are too close to be separated , so we extracted spectra for components a and b+g .",
    "the binned and bad pixel ( bad column ) corrected spectra of component a and b+g are shown in figure  [ fig:1406spec ] .",
    "the galaxy heavily contaminates the b+g spectrum , but component b is clearly a quasar at the same redshift as component a and with similar emission line widths ( see table  [ tab:1406em ] ) .",
    "if we scale and subtract the spectrum of a from the spectrum of component b+g , we find a residual spectrum corresponding to an early - type galaxy at @xmath38 , as shown in figure  [ fig:1406gspec ] .",
    "if we correct the b+g spectrum for the emission from the lens galaxy , the flux ratio of the a and b spectra shows little wavelength dependence .",
    "there are two interesting absorption systems in the spectra of sdss j1406 + 6126 .",
    "there is an absorption system at @xmath39 ( @xmath404730 ) with a @xmath41 rest frame equivalent width ( rew@xmath42 ) of 1.3 in the spectrum of component a that is absent ( rew@xmath43 ) from the spectrum of component b. a second system at @xmath44 ( @xmath407150 ) has the rew@xmath42 of 1.3 in component a but only 0.3 in component b. these large equivalent width differences are occurring on scales of only @xmath45 ( for @xmath39 ) and @xmath46 ( for @xmath44 ) , respectively .",
    "such large fractional changes have been seen only for weak absorption systems ( rew@xmath42@xmath47 ) , as shown in figure  10 of @xcite .",
    "large rew@xmath42 variations on kpc scales in strong intervening absorption systems , like those we have found in the sdss j1406 + 6126 spectra , could indicate a range of size scales for such absorption systems or could be just rare outliers .",
    "the follow - up data strongly supports the hypothesis that both objects are two - image gravitational lenses . to do our final test that the hypothesis is reasonable , we modeled both systems using a standard mass model consisting of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with an external shear .",
    "the models have just as many parameters ( the einstein radius @xmath48 , the shear @xmath49 and its position angle @xmath50 , the position of the lens galaxy , and the position and flux of the source quasar ) as the data supplies constraints ( the 3 component positions and the 2 quasar fluxes ) , so the number of degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "thus we expect the mass model to be able to fit the data perfectly , and the only check on the models is the degree to which the parameters are physically reasonable .",
    "we adopt the relative positions and @xmath20-band flux ratios from table  [ tab:0746ap ] and table  [ tab:1406ap ] as constraints .",
    "we use the _ lensmodel _ software @xcite to fit the models , and the parameters of the best - fitting models ( @xmath51 ) and their 1@xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) errors are summarized in table  [ table : model ] .",
    "the external shears of @xmath54 required to fit the data are typical for lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted time delays and total magnifications are @xmath553 days and @xmath56 for sdss j0746 + 4403 , and @xmath5520 days and @xmath57 for sdss j1406 + 6126 .",
    "we have discovered two new lensed quasars in the sdss : sdss j0746 + 4403 and sdss j1406 + 6126 .",
    "sdss j0746 + 4403 is a two - image lens ( @xmath58 ) formed from a @xmath59 quasar by a foreground galaxy at @xmath60 .",
    "the redshift of the lens galaxy was estimated from its colors and @xmath20-band magnitude .",
    "sdss j1406 + 6126 is a two - image lens ( @xmath61 ) formed from a @xmath62 quasar by a spectroscopically confirmed lens galaxy at @xmath4 .",
    "both lenses have properties that are easily reproduced by standard lens models with reasonable parameters .",
    "sdss j0746 + 4403 is particularly important because it will be included in the well - defined statistical sample of the sqls that we plan to use to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "sdss j1406 + 6126 is slightly fainter than our magnitude limit for the statistical sample , but the relatively large image separation and the bright lens galaxy should make it a useful lens for studying the structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of sdss j1406 + 6126 is that it has two strong absorption line systems that show dramatic changes on the few kpc scales of the path separations , which could provide an useful insight into the size distribution of absorption systems .",
    "spectroscopy to measure the redshifts and velocity dispersions of the lens galaxies , high - resolution imaging to determine the structures of the lens galaxies , and measurements of the time delays are the next steps towards using these lenses to study the structure and evolution of galaxies .",
