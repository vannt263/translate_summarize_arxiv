    "one of the most promising approaches to describe the nonrelativistic many - fermion system is to define the problem on the spatial lattice and subsequently apply the monte carlo technique to probe the configuration space .",
    "this approach is particularly efficient when dealing with strongly interacting and dilute systems . in the limit of low densities",
    "the interaction between particles has predominantly two - body character .",
    "moreover it can be described by few parameters only , characterizing the low energy physics of two - body collisions .",
    "for example in the case of trapped fermionic atoms , which have been recently the subject of intensive theoretical studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the scattering length is the only parameter which determines the interatomic interaction .",
    "similarly , the physics of dilute neutron matter at densities corresponding to @xmath1 is captured by two parameters : scattering length and effective range in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "the basic problem of the lattice formulation is the determination of the hamiltonian parameters in order to describe properly the scattering phase shifts of two - body collisions .",
    "the prescription given by lscher@xcite relates the discrete energy spectrum of two - particle states in a box to the scattering phase shifts .",
    "however in order to use the lscher s formula , the exact two - particle energy spectrum has to be determined first , which in general is a nontrivial task .",
    "another prescription , given by seki and kolck for the case of large lattices , is more suitable for the low - energy nuclear problems.@xcite in this approach the interaction parameters are determined by consistently applying the effective field theory power counting rules .",
    "in this paper we present an alternative approach to determine the two - body interaction parameters .",
    "the method is especially well suited to deal with the discrete form of the interaction , commonly used in the lattice calculations.@xcite all _ finite lattice spacing _",
    "effects are properly included in the limit of large lattice volume .",
    "the final prescription bypass the tedious lscher s algebra leading to a simple expression convenient for practical applications .",
    "to capture the low energy physics of a fermi system let us consider the interaction which depends only on the relative coordinates of two particles : @xmath3 where the field operators obey the fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath4 and @xmath5 denotes the spin degree of freedom .",
    "in order to place the system on a 3d spatial lattice with lattice spacing @xmath6 and size @xmath7 the discretization of the above expression has to be performed .",
    "this leads to the replacement : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes lattice sites , and @xmath11 .",
    "consequently one gets instead of ( [ eqn : vcontinous ] ) : @xmath12 note that for the problem defined on the lattice , we need only a discrete set of values of the interaction potential defined for the lattice sites @xmath13 .",
    "hence it is sufficient to introduce the _ interaction on the lattice _ which is defined only on the lattice sites .",
    "it can be written in the form : @xmath14 the coupling constants @xmath15 contain the full information about the interaction between the particles .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to the on - site interaction when @xmath15 is nonzero only when @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . a more complicated case when the neighboring sites are included leads to the so called _ extended hubbard model _ ( @xmath18 ) , widely used in monte carlo simulations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it requires effectively two coupling constants ( due to the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian ) : @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( on - site interaction ) and @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( nearest - neighbor interaction ) .",
    "then the interaction reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes the summation over all neighboring pairs .",
    "in order to link the coupling constants @xmath15 to the phase shifts one has to consider the @xmath0 matrix , which in the case of low energy scattering can be parametrized as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the scattering length and @xmath28 denotes the effective range .",
    "the @xmath0 matrix fulfills the lippmann - schwinger equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the free particle propagator with the reduced mass @xmath31 .",
    "summation over momenta is limited to the first brillouin zone ie .",
    ", and each momentum component is discretized due to the box quantization conditions .",
    "as a first step , let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tmatrix ] ) in an iterative form , more suitable for numerical applications . expanding the lippmann - schwinger equation",
    "one obtains : @xmath32 if we define the matrix @xmath33 as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 then eq .  ( [ eqn : tmatrixiter ] ) takes the form : @xmath36 clearly the @xmath0 matrix can be written as an infinite sum : @xmath37 where the @xmath38 matrices are related to each other through the recurrence relation : @xmath39 the equation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tmatseries ] ) holds in general case .",
    "however in the case when the effective range expansion eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ere ] ) is valid , only the diagonal matrix elements are required . for the lattice interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : latticeinteraction ] ) the contribution @xmath40 takes the following form : @xmath41 where the square matrix @xmath42 of dimension @xmath43 is defined as : @xmath44 the contribution to @xmath33 reads : @xmath45 where : @xmath46 continuing this procedure for higher order contributions it can be shown that : @xmath47 where : @xmath48 hence the problem of computing diagonal elements of the @xmath0 matrix was reduced to calculation of traces of a relatively small matrices @xmath49 , of dimension @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to note that the final result ( [ eqn : t_sum_l ] ) includes the effects related to the finite lattice spacing ( incorporated by the relative coordinates of the lattice sites @xmath50 ) .",
    "let us examine the large lattice limit , by letting @xmath51 while keeping the lattice constant @xmath6 fixed .",
    "then the momentum is continuous within the first brillouin zone , and the summation can be replaced by the integration . to simplify the analysis , however , we place a spherically symmetric cut - off , including only momenta satisfying @xmath52 : @xmath53 this prescription sets to zero all two - body matrix elements , if the relative momentum of two particles exceeds a given momentum cut - off .",
    "note that the function @xmath54 will depend on the momentum cut - off and consequently the scattering parameters like @xmath27 i @xmath28 will also be the functions of @xmath55 . performing the integration with respect to the variables",
    "@xmath56 i @xmath57 the eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_p_r ] ) transforms into : @xmath58 the remaining integral can be calculated analytically by expanding @xmath59 and using the relation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for the principal value .",
    "the final result has the form : @xmath62 where : @xmath63 the expression ( [ eqn : t_sum_l ] ) together with ( [ eqn : g_integrated ] ) and ( [ eqn : ere ] ) provides the most convenient prescription for numerical applications .",
    "as an example let us consider the on - site interaction : @xmath64 it corresponds to the well - known _ hubbard model _ and is presently widely used to simulate the system of dilute , cold fermionic atoms.@xcite in this particular case , it is possible to find an analytic formula relating the coupling constant @xmath19 to the scattering length and the effective range .",
    "it is easy to realize that @xmath49 become now one - dimensional matrices ie . :",
    "@xmath65 where : @xmath66 the sum of the geometric series ( [ eqn : t_sum_l ] ) reads : @xmath67 in order to find the inverse of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath0 for small values of the momentum , we expand the logarithmic function : @xmath68 and get : @xmath69 comparing this equation with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ere ] ) one reproduces the well - known results@xcite : @xmath70 it is worth noting that due to the finite lattice spacing the zero range potential acquires the non - zero effective range @xmath28 .",
    "in this work we have presented the method to determine the two - body effective interaction parameters from the low energy scattering data when the problem is defined on the lattice . in the limit of large lattices",
    "we have obtained expressions which are particularly convenient for numerical applications .",
    "the prescription relates the interaction coupling constants to the effective range expansion parameters and can be applied to monte carlo simulations of many - body systems on large lattices .",
