    "[ figexpdata ] , as discussed by kraft and co - workers  @xcite . here , the governing dislocation mechanism changes with decreasing sample size from dislocation multiplication in the micron regime , to nucleation controlled plasticity of full ( 100 - 1000 nm ) and partial dislocations ( 10 - 100 nm ) .",
    "this contemporary viewpoint is well motivated by experimental data obtained at all these scales , but still raises the question of how very different underlying effects and mechanisms lead to the very impressive double - logarithmic scaling ?",

    "such a situation suggests an entirely probabilistic description of plasticity which considers only the statistics of both stress and plastic strain , and how this might change as a function of sample volume .",

    "however as the sample volume reduces the source length distribution must be truncated and at a sufficiently small sample length scale the bulk mean field picture breaks down , with the critical stress scale being set by the statistics of small sources and corresponding high critical stresses . on the other hand pharr and",
    "co - workers  @xcite assumed that the yield strength depends only on the spatial distribution of dislocations and on the distribution of their activation strengths . despite the lack of specific dislocation mechanisms ,",
    "an averaging of the resulting yield strength over a certain system size range demonstrates a cross over between a bulk strength at larger system sizes and close to the theoretical strength at very small system sizes .",

    "no size effect emerges .",
    "however for the case of an external length scale , a power law in strength emerges where the exponent is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the applicability of the size effect to a range of materials whose underlying microstructures are expected to be different in their details , motivates the need for a quite general approach that can not depend too strongly on the specifics of a particular material .",
    "one starting point is to acknowledge that bulk plasticity arises from irreversible structural transformations whose core regions generally have a finite spatial extent , and that each leads to a global plastic strain increment which , however small , is discrete .",

    "et al _ @xcite who , with a strain resolution of @xmath9 , where able to observe discrete plasticity in bulk metallic samples .",
    "such structural transformations may be characterised , in the first instance , by a critical stress needed for the plastic event to occur with a particular degree of certainty .",
    "this may be done by assuming that the model material is defined by a probability distribution of such critical stresses , and that the corresponding number density of irreversible structural transformations is given by the product of this distribution with the total number of distinct structural transformations admitted by the system , @xmath10 .",
    "the actual distribution of critical stresses will embody the details of the particular material through its underlying low energy potential energy landscape .",
    "this latter contribution arises directly from the assumption that plasticity occurs via thermal activation and as a result the distribution will have an implicit strain rate and temperature dependence . in the present work , the aforementioned distribution is assumed to have the form @xmath11=\\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{\\delta}\\right)\\sigma_{0}}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{0}}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{0}}\\right)^{\\delta}\\right ] \\label{eqprobdist}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive non - zero numbers , and @xmath14 is the gamma function .",

    "[ figexpdata ] .     and size effect exponent ( @xmath6 ) predictions according to eqn .  [ eqcentralcentralresult ] ( @xmath1 ) where the mean field value @xmath78 is used , for three different values of @xmath2 which characterizes the low stress regime of the critical shear distribution.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the applicability of the derived model is also well reflected in various experimental reports that address the extrinsic size - effect as well as the intermittency of plastic flow with respect to internal length scales . as - prepared single crystals in the size regime of some hundred nanometres",
    "are known to fall onto the trend depicted in fig .",
    "[ figexpdata ] , but irradiation  @xcite or the introduction of dispersed obstacles  @xcite in the same size range have been shown to erase the size effect in strength . in these cases",
    "dislocation - defect interaction determined by the internal length scale governs strength with the size effect now being decoupled from the external length scale of the sample . moreover , within this regime of a dominating internal length scale , small scale mechanical testing has qualitatively shown that the strain increment magnitudes reduce when investigating similar sample sizes that contain larger pre - existing dislocation- or defect - densities  @xcite .",
    "as such , the developed model is able to fully encompass some of the numerous experimentally observed stress - strain characteristics particular to some of the material systems covered in fig .",
    "[ figexpdata ] .    with the power - law exponent equalling , @xmath1 ,",
    "the two free parameters of the model are the exponent of the low - critical stress end of the critical stress distribution and the scaling exponent @xmath3 .",
    "mean field calculations have demonstrated that for plastic events dominated by single slip , @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "simulations have however shown that this value may also be applied to multi - slip plastic events  @xcite . assuming the mean field value for @xmath3",
    ", @xmath2 is the one free parameter of the model . taking the values used in fig .",
    "[ figwd]a ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) gives respectively the size effect exponents @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding power laws are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figfinalplot ] , along with the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ figexpdata ] showing good overall agreement .",
    "it should be emphasized that fitting to _ all _ of the data in fig .",
    "[ figexpdata ] is not a useful task , since @xmath6 is known to vary from material to material and also on the initial dislocation density and structure  @xcite . in the present theory",
    "this would be reflected by variations in @xmath2 and also possibly in @xmath3 .",
    "[ figfinalplot ] does however demonstrate that @xmath2 should be larger than 2 , giving a critical stress distribution that rises slowly from its zero value at zero stress .",
    "in addition to the assumed existence of a distribution of critical shear stresses the work assumes that as plasticity evolves , the distribution becomes truncated and renormalized , but overall it retains its intrinsic form .",
    "[ figdata]c puts this assumption into its appropriate context .",
    "the figure demonstrates that from the perspective of bulk plasticity , the current theory places the deformation curve of a micro - pilar experiment into the domain of micro - plasticity  several tens of plastic events in a micro - deformation stress - strain curve will correspond to only the very early stages of bulk deformation ( see for example the very early torsion experiments of tinder and co - workers  @xcite ) .",
    "this situation is equally valid for the size affected plasticity in fig .",
    "[ figdata]d , but it is somewhat hidden due to the lack of appropriate pre - factors on the strain axis .",
    "micro - plasticity is a deformation regime where significant structural evolution and hardening are largely absent  @xcite , indeed , there now exists a growing body of evidence that this is in fact the case for micro - deformation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned reference have in common that they experimentally show or suggest that there is little to no change in dislocation structure and density beyond the transition to extensive plastic flow .",
    "it is this perspective that gives justification to the assumption of an unchanging ( but continuously truncated ) critical stress distribution . put in other words",
    ", it is recognized that upon a discrete plastic event occurring the internal structure of the sample volume changes non - negligibly , however the next critical shear stress which characterises this new configuration , is still drawn from the same critical stress distribution since the characteristic internal length scale and dislocation density can not change in any significant way due to this event occurring  this is the essence of the micro - plastic regime . finally , the assumption that @xmath10 does not change with plastic evolution turns out not to be necessary for the derivation of eqn .",
    "[ eqse ] . indeed @xmath10",
    "could either decrease or fluctuate around some mean value with respect to the plastic evolution and the same scaling result would be obtained .",
    "in summary , the size effect paradigm `` smaller is stronger '' , as embodied by the power law , @xmath0 , is shown to originate from a combination of a size effect in stress derived from the extreme value statistics of an assumed distribution of critical stresses , and a size effect in strain derived from the finite scaling associated with scale - free dislocation activity .",
    "both contributions may be considered universal , depending little on the fine details of a particular material . in particular ,",
