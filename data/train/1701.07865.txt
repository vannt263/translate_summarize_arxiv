    "an interface between stationary and flying qubits , that enables a long - range entanglement between different quantum network nodes , is essential for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is of particular importance for the solid state qubits , such as quantum dots or color centers @xcite , which can be efficiently coupled to each other via photons and thus employed for quantum communications and distributed quantum information processing .",
    "however , the slow fluctuations in the environment of the solid - state qubits ( e.g.  the local strain and/or the local electric fields ) constitute a lingering challenge , because they unpredictably shift the optical transition frequency of the qubits @xcite .",
    "this slow drift of the transition frequency ( spectral diffusion ) makes it difficult to achieve the precise matching between the photons originating from different qubits that is required for efficient entanglement . to mitigate the spectral diffusion problem ,",
    "various methods have been proposed and successfully used @xcite , focusing primarily on the tuning of the emission spectrum and on improving the indistinguishability of the photons emitted from different qubits . in particular , it has been recently suggested @xcite that the application of a periodic sequence of the optical control pulses to a quantum emitter ( a two - level system coupled to the electromagnetic radiation bath ) can re - direct most of the emission into a peak located at a preset target frequency ( determined by the carrier frequency of the pulse driving field ) , and therefore greatly improve the indistinguishability of the photons coming from different emitters .    at the same time , there is a growing interest , accompanied by impressive progress @xcite in the long - range entanglement schemes based on the photon absorption , and the theoretical developments which allow control and tuning of the absorption spectra have become timely and interesting .",
    "correspondingly , a question arises whether the absorption - based entanglement can also be improved using the pulse control of the emitters , i.e. whether the absorption spectrum of a two - level system ( tls ) coupled to the radiation bath can be modified and tuned by the control pulses .",
    "besides , the studies of absorption of a tls subjected to an external control are of fundamental interest due to the intimate connection between emission and absorption @xcite . for instance , if the tls is continuously driven by a strong coherent laser field then the tls emission spectrum has an interesting three - peak structure , with two additional side peaks located at the frequencies @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the laser rabi driving frequency ) , and the absorption spectrum of the same system also acquires additional structure , displaying the regions of gain , corresponding to an amplification of the probing weak field instead of attenuation @xcite .     and excited state @xmath3 separated in the rotating frame by the detuning @xmath4",
    ". it is probed by measuring the energy absorbed from a weak field as a function of frequency .",
    "( b ) the absorption spectrum in the absence of any driving field has a lorentzian lineshape centered around @xmath4 .",
    "( c ) we will evaluate the absorption spectrum when the system is driven by a periodic sequence of @xmath5-pulses with inter - pulse time @xmath6.,width=321 ]    the emission spectrum of the pulse - controlled tls exhibits similarities with the continuously driven tls emission : it has a central peak at the carrier frequency of the pulses @xmath7 , as well as the satellite peaks at @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is the inter - pulse distance .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that absorption also can be controlled with the periodic pulses , and that the resulting absorption spectrum also has non - trivial features . in this work",
    "we study the absorption spectrum of a tls driven by a periodic sequence of optical @xmath5-pulses , and examine its dependence on the pulse sequence period and the detuning of the emitter with respect to the pulse frequency ( fig.[fig : skecthabsorption ] ) .",
    "we show that both expectations above are correct , and therefore the pulse control indeed can be a useful tool for controlling and tuning the absorption spectrum of a tls .",
    "the absorption spectrum has a pronounced peak of stimulated emission at the carrier frequency of the pulses , and equidistant satellite peaks with smaller spectral weights .",
    "the qualitative features of this absorption spectrum do not change much as long as the detuning between the carrier frequency of the driving pulses and the tls transition frequency remains moderate .",
    "therefore , we show that the optical control enables creation of pairs of quantum nodes ( one node working as an emitter and the other as an absorber ) with precisely matching frequencies , and therefore greatly increased entanglement efficiency .",
    "this approach can also be used to improve the coupling of the emitters and the absorbers to the optical cavities , since the laser pulses can tune both the emission and the absorption lines of the respective quantum nodes , bringing them in the resonance with the respective cavities , and stabilizing both the emission and the absorption peaks at the desired location .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the model of the two - level system coupled to the photon bath and controlled by the pulses , the master equations governing the system dynamics , and the two methods , analytical and numerical , used for calculating the absorption spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present analytical and numerical results demonstrating the control and tunability of the absorption spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present conclusions .",
    "we model the quantum emitter as a tls with the ground state @xmath9 and the excited state @xmath3 , separated in energy by @xmath10 ; below we set @xmath11 .",
    "initially , at time @xmath12 , the excited state is occupied and the ground state is empty .",
    "the tls is coupled to a photon bath , and is periodically driven by pulses of the laser field with the rabi frequency @xmath13 . within the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa )",
    "@xcite , in the reference frame rotating at frequency @xmath7 , the system in question is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the detuning of the tls s transition frequency from the carrier frequency of the pulses ; here we introduced the standard pseudo - spin pauli operators for the tls , namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the creation and the annihilation operator for a photon of mode @xmath21 with the frequency @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the strength of coupling to the tls .",
    "note that in the rotating frame all frequencies are measured from the pulse carrier frequency @xmath7 , so that the zero frequency in the rotating frame corresponds to @xmath7 in the lab frame ; we take it as the target frequency for our tls .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) represents the control pulses ; here we consider the simple situation of the square - shaped pulses , with @xmath25 during the pulses and zero otherwise .",
    "in fact , below we assume that the pulses are almost instantaneous , i.e.  that @xmath13 is much larger than all other relevant energy scales , and that each pulse performs an almost instantaneous 180@xmath0 rotation of the tls around the @xmath26-axis , interchanging @xmath3 and @xmath9 ; this assumption will be discussed further below . in the absence of control ( @xmath27 ) , the system exhibits spontaneous decay , and the corresponding emission rate is @xmath28 ; we normalize our energy and time units so that @xmath29 , and the corresponding spontaneous emission line has a simple lorentzian shape @xmath30 , with the half - width equal to 1 .",
    "the absorption spectrum is defined here in a standard way , as the energy absorbed by the tls from a weak probing field of frequency @xmath31 .",
    "the probing field is assumed to be weak enough that it does not significantly affect the population of each state  @xcite ; our goal is to calculate the absorption as a function of frequency and time .    to understand the dynamics of the system , we analyze the time evolution of the density matrix of the emitter , which is written as @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "for the tls described by the above hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , within the markovian approximation , the density matrix operator is governed by the master equations  @xcite in the rotating - wave approximation : @xmath34 since the pulse driving is assumed to be strong and short ( @xmath35 ) , the pulses can be considered as instantaneous .",
    "each of them inverts the populations of the excited and ground state and swaps the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the density matrices immediately before and after the pulse , correspondingly , with @xmath41 being an integer and @xmath6 the period of the pulse sequence ; in other words , the pulses interchange @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we want to determine the energy absorbed from a weak probing field by the tls subjected to the periodic sequence of the @xmath5-pulses .",
    "since the effect of the probing field is small , the absorption spectrum can be calculated within the linear response theory , so that at long times @xmath44 the absorbed energy @xmath45 is given by  @xcite @xmath46 \\rangle \\mathrm{e}^{-i \\omega \\theta } \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\label{eq : absorptioneq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 $ ] is the commutator of the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the angled brackets represent the expectation values evaluated in the absence of the probing field . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the time - dependent operators in the heisenberg representation , and the expectation values are taken with respect to the initial state of the two - level system ( in our case , fully occupied excited state and empty ground state ) .",
    "the constant @xmath52 is independent of the pulse parameters , and does not affect the spectral shape , determining only the absolute scale of the absorption . the expression ( [ eq : absorptioneq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 the term @xmath56 can be viewed as the direct emission of the two - level system and @xmath57 as the direct absorption so that the difference yields the net absorption  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 separately , and obtain the total absorption spectrum @xmath45 by taking the difference .     driven by a periodic sequence of @xmath5-pulses of period @xmath60 after @xmath61 pulses .",
