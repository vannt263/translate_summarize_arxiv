    "in the context of the intensive search for extra dimensions the randall and sundrum ( rs ) brane world scenario is specially compelling for its simplicity and depth @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the observable universe is a 3-brane boundary of a non - compact @xmath0 symmetric 5-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "the matter fields are restricted to the brane but gravity exists in the whole ads bulk and is bound to the brane by the warp of the infinite fifth dimension .    in recent years",
    "numerous studies have been conducted within the rs scenario [ see @xcite for a recent review and notation ] . from an effective 4-dimensional point of view",
    "@xcite the interactions existing between the brane and the bulk lead to a modification of the einstein equations by a set of two distinct terms , namely a local high energy embedding term generated by the matter energy - momentum tensor and a non - local term induced by the bulk weyl tensor .",
    "the resulting equations have a complex non - linear dynamics .",
    "for example the exterior vaccum of a collapsing distribution of matter on the brane is now filled with modes originated by the bulk weyl curvature and can no longer be a static space @xcite .",
    "previous investigations of the rs scenario have been focused on static or homogeneous dynamical solutions . in this proceedings",
    "we analyse some aspects of the inhomogeneous dynamics of a rs brane world vaccum [ see @xcite for more details ] .",
    "in the 4-dimensional effective geometric approach to the rs brane world scenario first introduced by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite , the induced einstein vaccum field equations on the brane are given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the brane cosmological constant and the tensor @xmath3 is the limit on the brane of the projected 5-dimensional weyl tensor . on one hand the weyl symmetries ensure it is a symmetric and traceless tensor . on the other the bianchi identities",
    "constrain it to satisfy the conservation equations    @xmath4    the tensor @xmath3 can be written in the following general form @xcite    @xmath5,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is the 4-velocity field and @xmath8 is the tensor which projects orthogonaly to @xmath6 .",
    "the forms @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent different characteristics of the effects induced on the brane by the free gravitational field in the bulk .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is interpreted as an energy density , @xmath10 as stress and @xmath11 as energy flux",
    ".    since the 5-dimensional metric is unknown , in general @xmath12 is not fully determined on the brane @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the effective 4-dimensional theory is not closed and to close it we need simplifying assumptions about the bulk degrees of freedom .",
    "for example we may consider a static and spherically symmetric brane vaccum with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 to find the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution on the brane @xcite .",
    "let us now show that it is possible to take a non - static spherically symmetric brane vaccum with @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 and still close the system of dynamical equations .    consider the general , spherically symmetric metric in comoving coordinates @xmath16 ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is interpreted as the physical spacetime radius .",
    "if the stress is isotropic then the traceless @xmath23 will have the general form    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the unit radial vector , given in the above metric by @xmath27 . then    @xmath28    where the energy density and pressures are , respectively , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "substituting in the conservation eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) we obtain the following expanded system @xcite    @xmath32 @xmath33 where the dot and the prime denote , respectively , derivatives with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a synchronous solution is obtained by taking the equation of state @xmath36 , giving @xmath37 with @xmath9 having the dark radiation form    @xmath38    where the dark radiation tidal charge @xmath39 is constant .",
    "consequently , we obtain    @xmath40    an exactly solvable closed system which depends on the two free parameters @xmath2 and @xmath39 . indeed , its solutions can be written in the lematre - tolman - bondi form    @xmath41    where @xmath22 satisfies    @xmath42    the function @xmath43 is naturally interpreted as the energy inside a shell labelled by @xmath35 in the dark radiation vaccum and is fixed by its initial configuration .",
    "let us assume from now on that @xmath44 and @xmath45 [ note that according to the recent supernovae data @xmath46 - see _ e.g. _ @xcite ] .",
    "then we have a de sitter brane with negative dark energy density and the gravitational field is confined to the vicinity of the brane .",
    "the marginally bound models corresponding to @xmath47 are the static solutions    @xmath48    and were used for the static exterior of a collapsing sphere of homogeneous dark radiation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath49 this corresponds to the zero mass limit of the tidal reissner - nordstrm black hole solution on the brane @xcite .",
    "it is for @xmath50 that the dark radiation vaccum really becomes dynamical .",
    "the solutions are better organized by a redefinition of @xmath51 , the function @xmath52 $ ] . as an explicit example",
    "take @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath54 and    @xmath55,\\label{sol1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 or @xmath57 refer respectively to expansion or collapse . since @xmath22 is a non - factorizable function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 these are new non - static , cosmological and intrinsically inhomogeneous exact solutions for negative dark energy dynamics on a spherically symmetric de sitter brane .",
    "the dark radiation dynamics defined by eq .",
    "( [ deq ] ) can lead to the formation of shell focusing singularities at @xmath58 and of regular rebounce points at some @xmath59 . to analyse these issues",
    "consider    @xmath60    if for all @xmath61 we find @xmath62 then a shell focusing singularity forms at @xmath63 . on the other hand if there exists @xmath64 where @xmath65 then a regular rebounce point forms at @xmath66 .",
    "for the dark radiation vaccum it is clear that no more than two regular rebounce epochs can be found . since @xmath45 there is always a phase of continuous expansion to infinity with ever increasing speed . for @xmath45 and @xmath44 other phases",
    "are possible depending on @xmath67 . to ilustrate consider @xmath68 . if @xmath69 then @xmath70 is positive for all @xmath61 .",
    "there are no rebounce points and the dark radiation shells may either expand continuously or collapse to a shell focusing singularity at @xmath71 .",
    "however for @xmath72 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vppn ] ) there are two rebounce epochs at @xmath73 with @xmath74 . since @xmath75 a singularity also forms at @xmath71 .",
    "the region between the two rebounce points is forbidden because there @xmath70 is negative .",
    "the phase space of allowed dynamics is thus divided in two disconnected regions separated by the forbidden interval @xmath76 . for @xmath77 the dark radiation shells may expand to a maximum radius @xmath78 , rebounce and then fall to the singularity . if @xmath79 then there is a collapsing phase to the minimum radius @xmath80 followed by reversal and subsequent accelerated continuous expansion . the singularity at @xmath71 does not form and so the solutions are globally regular .",
    "in this work we have reported some new results on the gravitational dynamics of inhomogeneous dark radiation on a rs brane .",
    "taking an effective 4-dimensional approach we have shown that under certain simplifying but natural assumptions the einstein field equations on the brane form a closed , solvable system .",
    "we have presented exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions for @xmath45 and @xmath44 showing they further depend on the energy function @xmath67 .",
    "we have also described the conditions under which a singularity or a regular bounce develop inside the dark radiation vaccum . left for future research are for instance the analysis of the confinement of gravity near the brane and the introduction of an inhomogeneous collapsing distribution of matter .",
