    "considering the immense wealth of materials newly synthesized or found in nature with low dimensional magnetic structure , one finds that the simple heisenberg hamiltonian , widely accepted as the paradigm of quantum magnets @xcite , is often complicated by further interactions .",
    "many compounds thus show ground states and phases , different from the generic long range magnetic order of heisenberg systems .",
    "in this paper we study the coupling of the magnetic degrees of freedom to lattice vibrations as a prominent example of an interaction `` beyond the heisenberg - hamiltonian '' .",
    "this coupling , often referred to as `` spin - phonon '' interaction is generic to _ all _ magnetic materials and thus the problem to what extent the magnetic structure is changed by its presence concerns all low dimensional magnetic compounds .",
    "though spin phonon couplings are ubiquitous in nature , the possibilities of treating them with some theoretical rigor are limited .",
    "the main reason is that magnetic and phononic excitation energies are not well separated .",
    "in contrast , for electron phonon coupling we can dwell on the fact that the bulk of the electronic excitations lies much higher in energy than the phonon modes .",
    "this allows , in general , to use the adiabatic approximation when calculating the renormalization of phonon frequencies due to electron - phonon coupling . for spin - phonon coupling ,",
    "however , this concept can not be applied , in general .",
    "one approach quite often used is to include local , einstein - type phonons as quantum mechanical objects .",
    "this model may be applied for certain vibrations of ligand atoms around the magnetic ions , but it is not very realistic as it violates the infinitesimal translational invariance of the lattice .    for relatively low - lying acoustic phonons , which are dominated by the heavy magnetic ions , the response of the spin system may be treated in adiabatic approximation . in one dimension",
    "the paper of cross and fisher @xcite has treated the spin - phonon coupling along such lines . in higher dimensions",
    "no study of spin - phonon coupling in the adiabatic limit has so far been presented .",
    "in addition any effect of the magnetic pressure on the phonon vibrations has been ignored so far .",
    "the magnetic energy of a square lattice of spins with 1nn antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath1 is given as @xmath2 which is typically of the order @xmath3 ev per atom .",
    "we may compare this magnetic energy with the energy @xmath4 of a cubic lattice of positive and negative elementary charges where the madelung constant @xmath5 is of order of unity . for rock salt",
    "we find e.g. @xmath6 .",
    "however , the pressure @xmath7 for the electrostatic system is @xmath8 , while @xmath9 for the magnetic system .",
    "although there is a factor of @xmath10 difference in the binding energies , the magnetic pressure is only a factor @xmath11 smaller compared to the pressure of the electrostatic system .",
    "the main reason for the relatively large magnetic pressure is the large spin phonon coupling caused by the strong distance dependence of the super exchange @xmath1 , which can not be neglected in describing realistic quantum spin systems .    as an important special case",
    "we also discuss the limit of very strong spin phonon coupling , which leads to a dimerization of the lattice . typically , the response of the ground state energy of a two - dimensional magnetic system to dimerization is of second order and thus much weaker than in the one - dimensional case .",
    "two dimensional models with dimerization are thus essentially different compared to their one - dimensional analogues , in particular in two dimensions dimerization does not necessarily lead to a breakdown of magnetic long range order . also the dimerization pattern , which leads to the lowest ground state is not clear in two dimensions .    this paper is organized as follows : in sect iia we study statically dimerized models , in particular we determine the optimal dimerization pattern in two dimensions .",
    "sect iib is devoted to einstein phonons coupled to two - dimensional spin systems . in sect",
    "iii we calculate explicitly the phonon spectrum and study structural instabilities driven by the spin - phonon coupling including the effect of the `` magnetic pressure '' .",
    "to approach the problem we assume in the first place that in two dimensions similar to one dimensional systems the spin lattice interactions lead to a transition to a dimerized state i.e. to a pattern of strong and weak bonds and we address the problem of the two dimensional correspondence of a dimerized chain .",
    "stair , plaquette and meander configurations ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) are obvious choices for such models , which have been discussed controversially in the literature @xcite .    here",
    "we show by a straightforward monte - carlo calculation @xcite that the plaquette - models have lowest energy .",
    "this is convincingly demonstrated in fig.[fig2 ] , where the extrapolated energies of the three configurations are shown .",
    "it is not clear however , whether configurations with larger unit cells or even disordered systems can still have lower energies . to clarify this point",
    ", we analyze hamiltonians of the type @xmath12 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all possible @xmath13 , with equal number of strong and weak bonds @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 specify the pattern and @xmath17 gives the strength of the deformation .",
    "this hamiltonian of course includes the configurations of fig.1 as special cases .",
    "this more general study stems from an expansion of the free energy of the system eq .",
    "[ eq : twod_dim_h ] in @xmath17 @xmath18 writing down @xmath19 explicitly we observe that it can be viewed as hamiltonian of a two layer ising model with ising spins @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath20 where the couplings of the ising model are given by dynamic dimer - correlations @xmath21 evaluated in the two - dimensional heisenberg model , i.e. for @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are either @xmath25 or @xmath26 corresponding to dimer operators @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "this means the quantum nature of the model is incorporated in the long ranged ising couplings which depend on the euclidean dynamical dimer correlation functions of the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "this `` perturbative approach '' is somewhat restrictive but we are interested in the phenomenologically relevant small dimerizations .",
    "also , with some more numerical effort quadruple and higher correlations could be studied and for large dimerizations the problem becomes rather trivial , since it is reduced to one dimensional heisenberg chains whose properties are well known .",
    ".,width=321,height=302 ]    the dimer correlations eq . [ eq : dimer_corr ] of the heisenberg model ( as well as the data shown in fig.[fig2 ] ) were evaluated using a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) loop algorithm @xcite , based on a path integral representation of the partition function @xcite . applying the loop algorithm ,",
    "autocorrelation effects play a minor role due to global spin updates , and expectation values of diagonal and off - diagonal operators are calculated efficiently within the framework of improved estimators @xcite .",
    "further , by taking the continuous time version of the algorithm @xcite , finite size effects in trotter direction are avoided .    with the dimer correlations eq.[eq : dimer_corr ] as coupling constants of the ising model we performed a standard classical monte - carlo simulation together with some cooling procedure @xcite .",
    "this analysis gives clear evidence for crossing stripe patterns in the plane of the a and b spins as ground state of the ising model @xcite .",
    "this amounts to a plaquette structure as lowest pattern of the model eq.[eq : twod_dim_h ] .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional case where @xmath19 is divergent @xcite when t approaches zero , @xmath19 stays finite in two dimensions , which a posteriori justifies our ansatz",
    ".    a crucial point which further distinguishes the one dimensional case from the two - dimensional is the presence of _ both _ long range magnetic order and a finite dimerization in the two - dimensional plaquette - model , whereas in one dimension any finite @xmath17 leads to a spin liquid ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum .    for static phonons",
    "we definitely observe a breakdown of long range magnetic order for sufficiently strong deformation @xmath17 .",
    "the critical value @xmath29 takes rather large and in general different values for different patterns . for",
    "the stair configuration @xmath29 takes its maximal value 1 , at which the system decouples into one - dimensional subsystems . for the plaquette configuration , @xmath29 is considerably smaller than 1 ( in the cluster series expansion approach @xmath30 @xcite ) , while we determined from our data @xmath31 .      to study the impact of a spin - phonon coupling on the magnetic long range order we next consider a two dimensional model coupled to einstein phonons .",
    "although the model is not realistic in many respects , it has still attracted a lot of attention and for the physics of its one dimensional form a fairly clear picture has emerged by now . in particular it",
    "is well known , that the quasi long - range order , leading to a logarithmic divergence in the structure factor at @xmath32 is destroyed by a relatively small spin - phonon coupling .",
    "this rises the problem to what extent the strong long range order of 2d systems is influenced in the presence of einstein phonons . to answer this ,",
    "we calculate the expectation value of the staggered magnetization operator , @xmath33 which is a measure of nel - order in the ground state .",
    "we adopt the common procedure ( see @xcite ) and compute the expectation value of @xmath34 @xmath35 for the full quantum - hamiltonian of spins @xmath36 at sites @xmath37 coupled to einstein phonons @xmath38 , and @xmath39 by a spin phonon coupling @xmath40 @xmath41 ) \\\\",

    "it is remarkable however that for parameters for which in the one - dimensional model one finds clear evidence for a finite correlation length at t=0 , the staggered magnetization is again nonzero , and its extrapolated value is only about @xmath43 reduced compared to the two - dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "also , @xmath44 displays a dominant @xmath45- finite size behaviour @xcite derived from the nonlinear sigma model description of the heisenberg model .     for the model eq.[eq : h_full ] as function of linear lattice size .",
    "the black circle is the value for the heisenberg - model from ref.@xcite.,width=415,height=302 ]    though we can not exclude a breakdown of long range order by studying even larger spin - phonon couplings or different , maybe more elaborate coupling mechanisms , we find , that a realistic coupling strength comparable to the ones found in one dimensional magnetic materials will _ not _ lead to a breakdown of long range order .",
    "so , the new feature we expect in two dimensions is the possibility of a structural phase transition driven by spin - phonon interactions without breakdown of long range order .",
    "to investigate the structural phase transition also from a phenomenological point of view , we consider the following two - dimensional heisenberg - hamiltonian coupled to classical phonons    @xmath46\\vec{s}_l \\vec{s}_m ,   \\label{eq : diff_coupling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath47 a spin @xmath48 operator at position @xmath49 , @xmath50 the distance vector between sites @xmath51 and @xmath52 at equilibrium , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the displacement vector of the ( l)th spin from equilibrium .",

    "the total hamiltonian consists of a sum of the hamiltonian @xmath57 for all layers plus the phonon contributions @xmath58 , which we assume to be derivable from a simple model with central force potentials @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which depend on the nearest neighbor and the next nearest neighbor ( diagonal ) distances between the ions    @xmath61    thus in equilibrium the total energy @xmath62 per site is given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the internal energy per site of the heisenberg model with j=1 and @xmath65 is the lattice constant .",
    "the magnetic energy @xmath66 has the tendency to compress the lattice as the super exchange coupling @xmath1 , which may be derived from a hubbard - type model , increases with decreasing lattice constant a. when we treat this magnetic pressure as an external pressure acting on the lattice , the equilibrium condition @xmath67 yields    @xmath68    here @xmath69 is again the spin phonon coupling , and following @xcite the force constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined as    @xmath72    with @xmath73 the equilibrium separation for either first or second neighbor pairs .",

    "when , however , the magnetic pressure is turned on , by lowering t , @xmath80 will become negative ( or strongly reduced ) which will affect , in particular , the stability of the lattice against shear .     of the matrix @xmath40 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 along a triangular path in @xmath84-space.,width=415,height=302 ]",

    "however here the @xmath15 of eq.[eq : ising_h ] . are replaced by @xmath95 and the @xmath16 by @xmath96 .",

    "typical eigenvalues for the spin - phonon coupling matrix @xmath101 along the symmetry lines of the square lattice are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "several features are noteworthy :    \\(i ) there is a considerable t dependence not only concerning the magnitude of the renormalization , but also the q - dependence .",
    "\\(ii ) there is a maximum of the renormalization around @xmath102 .",
    "\\(iii ) along @xmath103 there is no renormalization of the transverse branch , similar to the absence of the electron - phonon coupling for transverse modes in a nearly free electron model .",
    "\\(iv ) at small @xmath104 , a significant splitting of the eigenvalues along @xmath105 evolves , indicative of an increase of @xmath106 at low @xmath104 .",

    "the magnetic pressure effect lowers specific transverse phonon modes at long wavelengths , i.e. it destabilizes the lattice against certain shear deformations .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig5 ] where the undisturbed spectrum of a square lattice ( zeroth order in @xmath94 ) which follows from eq.[first ] by setting @xmath116 is shown together with the spectra including the external pressure and the second order contribution . here",
    "the equilibrium condition",
    "eq.[eq : equilib ] is a strong constraint on the system and the shear instability dominates the phonon renormalization .",
    "we should keep in mind however that realistic planar quantum antiferromagnets usually are ternary or even quaternary oxides and that the equilibrium condition of the lattice may be dominated by ligand contributions , not included in eq.[eq : equilib ] . as a consequence",
    ", we may ignore the magnetic pressure effect and consider solely the phonon renormalization due to the second order effect . here",
    "primarily zone boundary phonons are lowered , as may be seen from fig.[fig6 ] . for the calculation",
    "we have have chosen typical values for the model force constants , which approximately reproduce the acoustic phonon modes of typical cubic oxides with rock salt structure @xcite such as mgo or bao .",
    "for a wide variety of @xmath117 ratios we find that the softening is strongest near @xmath0 ; only for somewhat pathological choices of @xmath118 such as @xmath119 , @xmath120,we find that the @xmath121 frequency goes unstable first .",
    "the @xmath0 instability would lead to plaquette - like distortions , while the @xmath121 instability would yield stair - case distortions .",
    "this means that our results from spin - phonon coupling agree with the observation discussed above , that the plaquette is the energetically most favorable dimerization pattern .",
    "in this paper we have studied magnetic and structural instabilities of two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets . of the various dimerization patterns",
    "the energetically most favourable one at @xmath122 is the plaquette order .",
    "it was also shown that the various dimerisation patterns do not necessarily lead to a breakdown of long range magnetic order .",
    "in contrast to one dimension , the coupling to einstein phonons is found to reduce , but not to destroy the staggered magnetic moment .    the tendency to form dimerization patterns at sufficiently large spin phonon coupling",
    "is also reflected in the large renormalization of specific phonon frequencies , in particular near @xmath0 and @xmath121 .",
    "our results indicate that again , plaquette formations are the most favourable structural distortions .    in this paper",
    "we also point out to the importance of a `` magnetic pressure '' on the lattice caused by the relatively large spin phonon coupling .",
    "this pressure effect builds up with decreasing @xmath104 and may lead to a significant decrease , if not instability of specific shear elastic constants .",
    "presently we have treated the magnetic pressure as an external one . in principle it can also be included into the calculation of phonon frequency renormalization , e.g. by carrying out so called frozen phonon calculations , which is the ultimate form of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we finally remark that , wherever in the brillouin zone there occur renormalization effects due to spin phonon coupling , also a significant increase of the phonon line width is expected .",
