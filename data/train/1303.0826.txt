    "classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are young ( @xmath3 yr ) , low mass @xmath4 stars at the stage of gravitational contraction towards the main - sequence , activity of which is caused by magnetospheric accretion of protoplanetary disc matter @xcite .",
    "inner regions of the accretion disc are truncated by the stellar magnetic field and disc s matter slides down toward the star along the field lines .",
    "having reached the dense layers of the stellar atmosphere , matter is decelerated in the accretion shock , behind the front of which the most part of its kinetic energy converts into the short - wavelength radiation .",
    "one half of the radiation flux irradiates the star , producing the so - called hot spot on its surface .",
    "simulations , performed by dodin & lamzin @xcite , confirm the hypothesis , suggested by batalha et al .",
    "@xcite , that the so - called narrow ( @xmath5 kms@xmath6 ) components of emission lines in spectra of ctts are formed in this region .",
    "hence , if the narrow components of the emission lines are used for the magnetic field measurements , then the obtained field strength characterizes the field in the accretion zone on the stellar surface .",
    "the second half of the short - wavelength radiation flux of the shock from the cooling zone escapes upward , heating and ionizing the pre - shock gas .",
    "broad @xmath7 kms@xmath6 ) components of the emission lines are formed in this region as well as in a more extended region at the truncation radius , where the disc interacts with the field , and a magnetospheric wind are launched .",
    "the relation between the intensity of the narrow and broad components varies from line to line , changes over time , and for the same lines varies from star to star .",
    "because the broad components are formed in the region at a significant distance from the stellar surface , the field strength , measured on these components , is , as a rule , in several times smaller than that , measured on the narrow ones ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field of young stars determines an activity of ctts and plays a crucial role in an evolution of angular momentum of these objects , therefore a question about strength and topology of the magnetic field is one of the fundamental questions of physics of young stars . at the moment ,",
    "the magnetic field has been found in about 40 ctts .",
    "these measurements are significantly differ in the methods , and therefore , the field strength , measured in different works , can relate to different spatial regions .",
    "maps of the magnetic field at the photospheric level have been reconstructed by analysis of polarized light for the following stars : cv cha and cr cha @xcite , tw hya @xcite , v2129 oph @xcite , v2247 oph @xcite , aa tau @xcite , bp tau @xcite .",
    "the field has been detected by means of zeeman broadening in unpolarized light in 26 stars @xcite .",
    "the field on the narrow emission components , which are formed in the accretion zone , has been measured only in 10 stars : rw aur @xcite , tw hya @xcite , v2129 oph @xcite , aa tau @xcite , bp tau @xcite , gm aur , df tau , dn tau , gg tau @xcite , t tau @xcite .    to measure a magnetic field , spectra with a high quality",
    "are needed , therefore the observations carry out on large telescopes for bright stars with numerous strong lines . however , the number of such stars is small , and practically , it is limited by the list , presented above . if we do not aim to determine the magnetic field in the photosphere of the star , and want to determine the field only in the accretion spot at the stellar surface , by measuring the narrow components of the emission lines , then the success of the measurement is determined by the flux and shape of the profile of the lines , rather than by the brightness of the star .",
    "having considered a few dozen spectra of ctts , obtained at the vlt and keck observatories , we chose 8 relatively faint stars with the strong and narrow emission line of hei 5876 , the magnetic field of which had never been measured before . in our paper",
    "the measurements for three of these eight stars are presented : do tau ( spectral type m0 , range of variability in @xmath8 @xcite ) , dr tau ( k5 , @xmath9 @xcite ) , ds tau ( k5 , @xmath10 @xcite ) .",
    "the method we use to measure magnetic field is based on the fact that so - called @xmath11-components resulted in zeeman splitting are polarized circularly such as oppositely polarized components are located on different sides of the central wavelength @xmath12 . if magnetic field in a line formation region has a longitudinal component @xmath13 then the right- and left - hand polarized components will be shifted relative to each other to @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lande @xmath15-factor of the considered line , @xmath16 and @xmath12 are in  and @xmath13 is in kg .",
    "this relation allows to find the longitudinal magnetic field component @xmath17 averaged over the line formation region , by measuring @xmath16 from two spectra observed in the right- and left - hand polarized light .",
    "observations were carried out on 2012 october 26 - 27 with the main stellar spectrograph @xcite of 6-m telescope of special astrophysical observatory equipped with a polarization @xmath18-plate and a double slicer @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph slit width was @xmath19 the observations were carried out in the spectral range 5640 - 6480  by using ccd array ( e2v ccd42 - 90 ) , the size of which along the dispertion was 4600 pixels that corresponds to the inverse linear dispersion of 0.183  / pixel .",
    "spectra were processed as follows @xcite .",
    "night sky emission and detector bias as well as cosmic ray traces were removed in a standard way , using routines from the midas software package .",
    "a spectrum of a thorium - argon lamp was used for a wavelength calibration .",
    "each observed spectrum was transformed into the stellar rest frame by shifting it as a whole ( by radial velocity ) until a coincidence of photospheric lines in the observed and simulated spectra @xcite .",

    "one measurement of the field needed two exposures , between which the superachromatic quarter - wave phase plate was rotated in such a way that the right- and left - hand polarized spectra changed places on the ccd array .",
    "thus , we get four spectra of the star : right- and left - hand polarized at the first exposure @xmath22 , @xmath23 and similar spectra of @xmath24 , @xmath25 at the second exposure .",
    "further we calculated the difference between the positions of the lines in the spectra @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which we denoted as @xmath26 , between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which we denoted as @xmath27 and between @xmath28 and @xmath29 which we denoted as @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the sum of simultaneously obtained spectra .",
    "these differences were calculated by using the crosscorrelation method @xcite for the confidence level @xmath32 that corresponds to 1@xmath11 error .",
    "the shift due to zeeman effect is equal to @xmath33 a mean systematic shift between @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 and a systematic shift between two exposures : @xmath37 all shifts were calculated in pixels , and then , if necessary , were translated in  .",
    "we used this method to measure @xmath13 on the lines hei 5876 , nai d and [ oi ] 6300 .",
    "however , in the case of the field measurements on many lines , it is appropriate to measure the shifts all considered lines at once . in this case",
    ", the procedure of measurements @xmath16 should be refined .",
    "the shifts @xmath38 @xmath39 , calculated by the crosscorrelation method , include two shifts of different nature : @xmath16 and @xmath40 on the one hand , the shift @xmath16 is different for each spectral line , therefore to find @xmath38 by calculating the maximum of the correlation function , we should choose the value of @xmath13 as an independent variable , because it is the same for all lines , while the shift of each line should be calculated by the formula  ( 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the systematic shift @xmath41 is assumed to be constant for the entire spectrum , therefore to find it , we should choose a shift of the spectrum as a whole as the independent variable .    to combine these contradictory requirements",
    ", we had found an average systematic shift @xmath42 , assuming that it behaves like @xmath16 and then we corrected the spectrum for this shift @xmath43 because @xmath44 this correction does not eliminate the systematic error , but only reduces it . however , 3 - 4 iterations of the procedure allow to eliminate the systematic shift almost entirely .",
    "an uncertainty of the value @xmath16 , defined in this manner , equals to @xmath45    lande factors of photospheric lines were adopted from the vald database @xcite . in the case of blended photospheric lines @xmath15-factors were averaged with weights of a central depth : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a gaussian profile of an @xmath48-th line in the blend .",
    "the width of the gaussian was found from the observed spectrum , and the amplitude was equated to the line depth from the vald database .",
    "we take into account all photospheric lines with known lande factors @xmath49 which fall in our spectral range and have a central depth greater than 0.1 .",

    "we have observed stars with a known magnetic field : 53 cam and @xmath21 equ , as well as giants : hd216228 and hd31398 , the field of which should be close to zero .",

    "<S> results of measurements of the longitudinal magnetic field in a hot accretion spot in three classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are presented . the magnetic field in the formation region of the narrow component of the emission line hei 5876  was found for each star in our sample at a level of more than 2@xmath0 in case of ds tau we have found the field in the narrow components of nai d lines , which was equal to @xmath1 kg , i.e. it was equal to the field measured on the narrow component of hei 5876  . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the magnetic field in the hot spots can be studied for ctts down to 13@xmath2 that allow in the future to double a number of ctts with measured field in the accretion zone . </S>"
