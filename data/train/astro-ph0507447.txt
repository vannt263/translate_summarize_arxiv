    "mrk 421 is the archetype and closest known tev blazar ( z = 0.031 ) , first detected at tev @xmath0-ray energies by the whipple 10 m telescope in 1992 @xcite .",
    "blazars typically reside in large elliptical galaxies and are characterised by rapid variability at @xmath0-ray energies , providing evidence of relativistic jet beaming along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "blazar surveys show a continuous sequence in spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with tev blazars at the high energy , low luminosity end @xcite . in the ssc model",
    "the first broadband peak in the sed ( from uv to soft x - ray ) is attributed to synchrotron radiation , and the second peak at gev energies from inverse - compton emission .",
    "detailed studies of the x - ray spectrum over a broad energy range from 0.1 - 25 kev detected by the satellite missions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 find the synchrotron peak shifted to higher energies ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) during high flux levels @xcite .",
    "mrk 421 displays strong variability in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray tev bands on nearly all time - scales of hours to years with particularly strong flaring states detected by multiwavelength campaigns in 1995 , 1998 , 2001 , and recently in 2004 @xcite .",

    "( 2005 ) present a temporal analysis and correlation study of whipple 10 m @xmath0-ray observations and near simultaneous @xmath3 x - ray observations from december 2003 to may 2004 .",
    "this paper provides an extended analysis of the same data by resolving the x - ray spectrum on day time - scales and providing integral flux and hardness ratios for the tev @xmath0-ray data .",
    "the nasa x - ray satellite @xmath3 was launched in 1995 , and is still in operation .",
    "the proportional counter array ( rxte - pca ) instrument on board covers a nominal energy range of 2 - 60 kev and consists of 5 pcu detectors . during the 2004 campaign only pcu0 and",
    "pcu2 were operational .",
    "the daily `` snap - shot '' observations range from 0.6 - 16 ksec with a mean of 2.2 ksec .",
    "we followed the standard procedure for data reduction using ftools 5.3 by filtering the data into good time intervals and extracting a spectrum for individual observations . using the latest background models and calibration tools simulated background spectra and response matrices",
    "were created with pcabackest and pcarsp . for the high - state flux level during 12 - 23 april 2004",
    "the spectra were fit over 28 bins from 4 - 15 kev .",
    "all other spectra were rebinned by a factor of three due to low significances ( 4 - 6@xmath5 ) , resulting in nine bins covering 4 - 15 kev .",
    "three fit models were tested : a simple power law , power law with an exponential cut - off , and a log - parabolic model .",
    "all fits included the fixed galactic column density @xmath6 @xmath7 accounting for absorption from interstellar gas .",
    "figure [ chi ] shows the distribution of reduced @xmath8 goodness of fits for all observations to a power law and log - parabolic model .",
    "it is clear a power law is not applicable to the data .",
    "the fits to an exponential cut - off give a marginally worse mean reduced @xmath8 of 0.98 compared to 0.87 for a log - parabolic model . due to the limited energy coverage of 4 - 15 kev the calculated break energy in the exponential cut - off is unrealistically pushed to energies beyond the fit range ( @xmath9 15 kev ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore proceed with the log - parabolic fit described by @xmath10 with @xmath11 set at 1 kev , giving three parameters : normalisation @xmath12 , index @xmath13 , and curvature term @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the peak flux in the log - parabolic curve ( synchrotron peak ) is given as @xmath15 in erg @xmath7 s@xmath16 and the peak energy as @xmath17 in kev .",

    "hopkins , arizona , usa at an elevation of 2312 m and is presently operating with the 379 pixel , @xmath18 field of view camera in place since 1999 . monitoring mrk 421 for high - state variability",
    "is a high priority ; from november 2003 to may 2004 over 250 source @xmath19 observations were carried out , each with a duration of 28 minutes . from this data set 141 runs met the criteria of zenith angle @xmath20 and relative throughput @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations of @xmath22 @xmath0-ray primary air showers with an energy distribution of @xmath23 from 100 gev to 50 tev were generated with the grisu package applying the 2004 telescope configuration for detection and analysis .",
    "the energy `` threshold '' , defined as the position of the peak in the detected differential energy spectrum , is 250 gev at trigger level , and 400 gev for events passing background rejection cuts described below .",
    "a combination of techniques from whipple 10 m , hegra ct1 , and h.  e.  s.  s. data analysis are used here to derive integral flux values . after image cleaning , second moment and angle parameterisation , and trigger level cuts ,",
    "@xmath0/hadron `` extended '' cuts on @xmath24 and @xmath25 parameters were calculated from @xmath0-ray simulations for a 90% cut efficiency nearly independent of energy @xcite . due to the small field of view shower images at the edge of the camera",
    "are truncated .",
    "a cut on @xmath26 of @xmath27 reduces this effect .",
    "the energy of each event is estimated using the method for hegra ct1 data described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter was scaled according to the throughput of each observation relative to a clear off field at @xmath29 zenith angle , providing a gain correction for nights with low atmospheric transparency @xcite . a resolution in the shower core distance @xmath30 of @xmath3120% and",
    "energy resolution @xmath32 of 26% for whipple 10",
    "m simulations agree with that found for hegra ct1 @xcite .",
    "we apply a `` tracking '' analysis where the background region of the @xmath33 plot was used to estimate the background in the signal region @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to match off fields from different observations to the @xmath19 data based on zenith angle , throughput , and other factors . comparing both techniques to a subset of mrk 421 data with dedicated off field observations",
    "gives a systematic error of 6% in the estimated background number , and 10% in the integral flux value .",
    "the integral flux is then simply the sum over the inverse effective areas calculated for each excess event , divided by the observation time . by using the `` modified '' effective area ( collection area as a function of estimated energy ) the energy resolution and biases",
    "are implicitly accounted for @xcite .",
    "the individual event effective areas are found by linear interpolation between logarithmic energy bins .",
    "the lower energy limit for integral flux values has been placed at 500 gev , above which energy the effective area is relatively flat and independent of spectral shape .",
    "a hardness ratio was set for the bands i(0.5 - 1 tev)/i(1 - 9 tev ) .",
    "data over the april 2004 high - state flux level are resolved on nightly time - scales with exposures ranging from 0.5 - 2.8 hours .",

    "the rxte - pca x - ray integral flux i(4 - 15 kev ) varies from a medium flux state to the near the highest yet detected , reaching the march 2001 peak value of @xmath3515 @xmath3610@xmath37 erg @xmath7 s@xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the spectral shape stays nearly constant during the first day ( 53114 mjd ) .",
