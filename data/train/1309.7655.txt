    "notice that differently from the conservative case , the sum of the above coefficients is not normalized to 1 , e.g. @xmath54 , due to the presence of gain and loss in the system which does not allow the norm conservation . in particular , the above coefficients during the scattering can become larger than one due to the gain action of the pt defect . in all numerical investigations reported below , the gs is constructed as a stationary solution of the periodic nls equation located at large distance ( @xmath55 ) from the pt defect ( far away from the defect such states practically coincide with those of the nlse with a perfect ol ) .",

    "it is worth to note the differences in the behavior of the reflection coefficient .",
    "while in the case ( @xmath63 ) the coefficient @xmath45 approaches the value 1 in the regions of non existence of defect modes , one can see that in the case @xmath64 the @xmath45 coefficient in the interval @xmath65 $ ] in the total reflection regions becomes slightly greater than 1 [ see fig .  [ fig_eta+-](a ) ] , meaning that during reflection the gs has been amplified by the defect .",

    "[ fig_eta+-](b ) ] .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath45 coefficient may at a first sight appear counter - intuitive , especially if one observes that in our numerical experiments the gs is always coming from the left and when it gets amplified ( resp",

    "negative ) , the amplification ( resp .",
    "depletion ) of the gs is expected during the reflection .",
    "this is exactly what it is shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_conv ] where results of two distinctive cases from fig .",

    "[ fig_conv ] we have depicted the trajectory of the center @xmath76 @xmath77 of the density distribution during the reflection .",
    "one can see from this figure that , in agreement with our intuitive argument , for smaller values of @xmath78 ( e.g. on the right side of resonanceat @xmath79 ) the gs can penetrate the defect more and in the cases in which the gs is amplified , the turning point of the trajectory always occurs closer ( resp .",
    "less close ) to the origin for @xmath68 ( resp .",
    "@xmath69 ) .",
    "the opposite behavior is observed for a gs that is depleted during the reflection .",
    "interesting results are also observed when the imaginary part of the defect potential is increased and the non - hermitian character of the interaction contributes more significantly to the scattering . for the chosen ratio @xmath80 , this occurs around the value @xmath81 as one can see from the details depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_eta+-zoom](a ) .    from this",

    "the explanation of this follows from the same arguments given above and from the fact that the interaction with almost resonant stationary defect modes will further prolong the interaction time that the gs has with the gain side of the defect , this resulting in an higher amplification .",

    "@xmath86 ) when @xmath78 is increased through the resonant point @xmath87 .",

    "this explanation also correlates with the above arguments in terms of turning points and mean effective potentials @xmath90 .    from the more detailed fig .",
    "[ fig_eta+-zoom ] , it appears evident that just beyond the point @xmath87 , trapping becomes dominant and due to strong interaction with defect modes , the gs becomes very unstable this leading to the irregular oscillatory behavior observed for the trapping coefficient in the panel ( b ) of the figure . by decreasing the velocity of the incoming gs ,",
    "however , the transmission peaks become narrow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_eta+-v002 ] ) and the @xmath45 coefficient becomes closer to 1 in the total reflection regions ( scattering is less affected by the complex potential ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for a smaller velocity a small amount of the gs wavefunction penetrates the defect and the interaction with the complex part of the potential is reduced .",

    "[ fig0475_ini ] . for parameters of the pt potential that are below the threshold of the spontaneous pt - symmetry breaking (",

    "we remark here , however , that a proof of the validity of the effective mass theorem for periodic pt potentials is presently lacking ( notice that in our case the ol is real and the pt symmetry is only coming from the defect ) .    in an effective mass description",
    "one would expect that a change of sign in the effective mass can be compensated by a change of sign of the defect potential .",

    "the fact that the gs is wider in the first gap permits , for the same incoming velocity , a stronger interaction with the right side of the defect , than the one of the more localized gs in the semi - infinite gap .",
    "since the right side of the defect is of loss type for the gs in the first gap ( see panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig0475_ini ] ) and of gain type for the gs in the semi - infinite gap ( see panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "we showed that gs with effective masses of opposite sign behave similarly in pt defect potentials of opposite sign especially for parameters values close to high resonances .",
    "finally , we discussed the scattering of a gs by a pt defect which leads to an unidirectional transmission or blockage ( _ diode effect _ ) , and the amplification / depletion of a gs trapped between a pair of consecutive pt defects .",
    "finally , in closing this paper we remark that since pt - symmetric potentials can be easily implemented in nonlinear optical systems , we expect the above results to be of experimental interest for systems such as arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides and photonic crystals .",
