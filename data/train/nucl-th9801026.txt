    "recent experimental and theoretical studies of weak decays of hypernuclei have generated renewed interest on nonleptonic weak interactions of hadrons .",
    "a long standing problem is the dominance of @xmath8 amplitudes , called the @xmath8 rule , in the strangeness changing transitions .",
    "nonleptonic decays of kaons and @xmath9 , @xmath10 hyperons are dominated by the @xmath8 transition but it is not clear whether this dominance is a general property of all nonleptonic weak interactions .",
    "in fact , the weak effective interaction which is derived from the standard model including the perturbative qcd corrections contains a significantly large @xmath2 component@xcite .",
    "it is therefore believed that nonperturbative qcd corrections , such as hadron structures and reaction mechanism are responsible for suppression of @xmath2 , and/or enhancement of @xmath8 transition amplitudes .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "decays of hyperons inside nuclear medium provide us with a unique opportunity to study new types of nonleptonic weak interaction , that is , two- ( or multi- ) baryon processes , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .",
    "these transitions consist the main branch of hypernuclear weak decays because the pionic decay @xmath13 is suppressed due to the pauli exclusion principle for the produced nucleon .",
    "a conventional picture of the two - baryon decay process , @xmath11 , is the one - pion exchange between the baryons , where the @xmath14 vertex is induced by the weak interaction@xcite . in @xmath11 ,",
    "the relative momentum of the final state nucleons is about 400 mev / c , much higher than the nuclear fermi momentum .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction at this momentum is dominated by the short - range repulsion due to heavy meson exchanges and/or to quark exchanges between the nucleons .",
    "it is therefore expected that the short - distance interactions will contribute to the two - body weak decay as well .",
    "exchanges of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 mesons and also correlated two pions in the nonmesonic weak decays of hypernuclei have been studied@xcite and it is found that the kaon exchange is significant , while the other mesons contribute less@xcite .",
    "several studies have been made on effects of quark substructure@xcite . in our recent analyses@xcite , we employ an effective weak hamiltonian for quarks , which takes into account one - loop perturbative qcd corrections to the @xmath19 exchange diagram in the standard model@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the @xmath8 part of the hamiltonian is enhanced during downscaling of the renormalization point in the renormalization group equation . yet",
    "a sizable @xmath2 component remains in the low energy effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "we proposed to evaluate the effective hamiltonian in the six - quark wave functions of the two baryon systems and derived the `` direct quark ( dq ) '' weak transition potential for @xmath20@xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the dq contribution largely improves the discrepancy between the meson - exchange theory and experimental data for the ratio of the neutron- and proton - induced decay rates of light hypernuclei .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath2 component of the effective hamiltonian gives a sizable contribution to @xmath3 transition amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , we can not determine the @xmath2 amplitudes unambiguously from the present experimental data@xcite .",
    "the dq transition takes place only when @xmath9 overlaps with a nucleon in hypernuclei and therefore predominantly in the relative @xmath21-states of @xmath22 systems .",
    "the two - body transition potentials for the initial @xmath23 and the final @xmath24 states are computed in the dq mechanism and are compared with those in the one - pion exchange ( ope ) mechanism . because of quark antisymmetrization effects , the transition potential contains nonlocal components and as the transition may break the parity invariance , it also contains derivative terms .",
    "the general form of the transition potential is @xmath25 fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the local part of the dq and ope potentials and fig .",
    "1(b ) shows the nonlocal part of the dq potential for the @xmath26 transition .",
    "it can be seen in the local potential that the dq is dominant at short distances , @xmath27 fm , while the ope in the region @xmath28 fm is modified strongly by the form factor introduced according to @xcite .",
    "both the local and nonlocal potentials show that @xmath2 contribution is significant",
    ". such strong violation of the @xmath8 dominance takes place in @xmath3 transitions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "= 80 mm    = 70 mm    because the ope potential is determined phenomenologically , the relation between dq and ope is not trivial . in order to check the consistency ,",
    "we relate the @xmath31 coupling constant to a baryon matrix element of the weak hamiltonian for quarks by using the chiral property . in the soft - pion limit",
    ", the soft - pion theorem leads to@xcite @xmath32|\\lam\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the third component of the axial charge operator .",
    "the weak hamiltonian @xmath34 consists only of left - hand currents and the flavor - singlet right - hand currents , and therefore satisfies @xmath35 = - [ i^{3},h_{w}]$ ] , where @xmath36 is the third component of the isospin operator .",
    "taking the parity conserving part , we obtain@xcite @xmath37 the lhs of this equation is proportional to the effective @xmath14 weak coupling constant , defined by @xmath38 where the phenomenologically determined value of the coupling constant is @xmath39 ( dimensionless ) . the rhs of eq.([eq : sp ] ) can be evaluated by using the present quark model . then using the goldberger - treiman relation",
    "we obtain @xmath40 in our quark model . here",
    "@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is defined for @xmath43 this value is about 30% larger than the phenomenological one .",
    "the reason for the overestimation may reside in the soft - pion assumption as well as in the approximation of the baryon wave functions , that is , the orbital quark wave functions of @xmath9 and @xmath44 are assumed to have the same gaussian form .",
    "however , by this estimate we can determine the relative phase of the phenomenological @xmath14 coupling constant and the weak quark hamiltonian .",
    "namely , the product of @xmath45 and @xmath41 in the ope potential must be positive in order to be consistent with the weak hamiltonian we employ .",
    "note that the single baryon matrix element @xmath46 has no contribution from the @xmath2 part of @xmath34 and therefore eq.([eq : sp ] ) guarantees the @xmath8 dominance .",
    "in fact , the same argument leads to the @xmath8 rule for the pionic decays of hyperons as all the single baryon matrix elements , such as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , have no @xmath2 contribution if we assume a valence quark picture for the baryon according to @xcite .",
    "the soft - pion limit also predicts that the @xmath49 decay is not allowed because the transition from @xmath50 to @xmath51 is possible only through the @xmath2 weak hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , @xmath49 is strongly suppressed experimentally .",
    "in @xcite , we calculated the nonmesonic decay rates of @xmath52he , @xmath53he , and @xmath53h in the dq and ope mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath21-shell hypernuclei are most suitable for the study of the microscopic mechanism of the weak decay as their wave functions are relatively simple and contain only @xmath23 states .",
    "they also enable us to select spin - isospin components for the weak decay .",
    "we here use a realistic @xmath9-nucleus wave function constructed from the yn g - matrix interaction ( yng potential@xcite ) with the @xmath54 harmonic oscillator wave function for the nucleus . we also include the short - range correlation , the nijmegen d correlation for ope and the gaussian soft cutoff correlation according to the baryon s quark wave function for dq .",

    "also large @xmath2 contributions are predicted for @xmath3 transitions ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "accordingly , the neutron induced decay rate @xmath85 is enhanced from 0.025 ( ope only ) to 0.206 ( ope+dq ) and thus improves the @xmath6 ratio .",
    "this is still short of the experimental value as @xmath86 is dominated by the @xmath87 amplitudes from the strong one - pion tensor component .",
    "it was suggested that the kaon exchange may be important in reducing the @xmath88 @xcite .    for @xmath53h , because no @xmath87 @xmath89 contributes , the dq transitions become dominant .",
    "both @xmath86 and @xmath85 are significantly enhanced by dq : @xmath90 ( ope ) to @xmath91 ( dq+ope ) , and @xmath92 ( ope ) to @xmath93 ( dq+ope ) , and the total decay rates is predicted to be @xmath94 . although an indirect estimate @xcite suggests @xmath95 , a direct measurement is very much anticipated .",
    "for @xmath53he , the neutron induced decay is suppressed , which seems consistent with experiment .",
    "the two - body weak interaction can be directly studied in the @xmath9 production scattering : @xmath7 .",
    "the cross sections of such two - body processes were calculated in the meson exchange model@xcite , which claim @xmath96 barn .",
    "the cross section is dominated by the @xmath97 and @xmath98 channels and shows significant parity violation ( @xmath99% ) .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath100 cross section in the full six - quark cluster model with dq+ope weak transitions .",
    "we employ the standard quark cluster model for the initial @xmath1 and the final @xmath22 scattering wave functions@xcite .",
    "the model contains the nonrelativistic quark kinetic energy , one - gluon exchange interaction ( central + spin - spin + spin - orbit parts ) , and the meson exchange potentials for the nonets of scalar , pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the parameters in the meson exchange potential are tuned so as to reproduce the @xmath1 scattering phase shifts up to @xmath101 mev . for the @xmath22 scattering ,",
    "the @xmath102 channels are always coupled .",
    "the transition t matrix is calculated in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) formulation .",
    "our preliminary results consider only the weak transition to @xmath103 ( not @xmath104 ) and only the @xmath105 and @xmath97 @xmath22 final states .",
    "we found that the cross sections are of order of @xmath106 barn , and are sensitive to the choices of the form factor for ope and parameters in the @xmath22 final state interactions .",
    "2 shows the ( preliminary ) results , which indicate that the ope is dominated near threshold .",
    "the amplitudes are dominated by the @xmath87 contribution .",
    "we also found that the pv / pc ratio depends on the @xmath22 energy rather strongly .",
    "it becomes as large as 60% at @xmath107 mev .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath108 channels and the higher partial waves have to be done further as well as study of dependencies on the parameters in the final state interactions .",
    "further study is under way .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to stress that nonmesonic weak decays of hypernuclei and weak hyperon productions are rich sources of interesting information on the nonleptonic weak interactions of hadrons . here",
    "we have discussed the possibility of the direct quark contributions . we have found that the @xmath8 rule may be significantly violated in hypernuclear weak decays , which can be tested in decays of the @xmath21-shell hypernuclei .",
    "it is crucial to have a high quality measurement of the decays of @xmath53h .",
    "recently , we pointed out that soft @xmath109 emissions in weak decays of hypernuclei probe the @xmath2 part of the nonmesonic weak decay@xcite .",
    "we found that the soft @xmath109 can be emitted in the two - body process which is induced by the @xmath2 weak interaction .",
    "the dq transition potential predicts significant @xmath109 emissions in light hypernuclei .",
    "this opens a new possibility to check consistency in the weak decay mechanisms .",
