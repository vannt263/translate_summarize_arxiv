    "star clusters are the most highly visible stellar population components in galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "their integrated properties are generally used to trace , e.g. , their host galaxy s star ( cluster ) formation history , the impact and time - scales of the most recent ( major ) mergers or close encounters with any neighbouring galaxies , and the extent to which environmental conditions drive the evolution of star cluster systems in their own right .",
    "the galaxies in the local group represent unique benchmarks which can be used to verify analyses based on integrated cluster properties using resolved stellar photometry ( e.g. , de grijs & anders 2006 ; colucci & bernstein 2012 ; baumgardt et al .",

    ", the star cluster systems in the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc , lmc ) can provide unique insights into the properties of their resolved star cluster populations .",
    "prompted by recent claims ( chandar , fall & whitmore 2010a ; chandar , whitmore & fall 2010b ) and counterclaims ( e.g. , baumgardt et al .",
    "2013 ) that the disruption rate of star clusters in the lmc may be significant from early ages ( a few myr ) up to an age of @xmath3 gyr , we decided to revisit this issue based on a number of complementary approaches .",
    "chandar et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) determined the cluster population s age and mass distributions based on fits to the broad - band spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) from hunter et al.s ( 2003 ) comprehensive database of integrated lmc cluster photometry .",
    "they used simple stellar population ( ssp ) models characterized by fully sampled stellar mass functions ( mfs ) for their parameter derivation ( cf . section 2 ) .",
    "two other studies used exactly the same photometric database to independently determine the clusters ages and masses .",
    "specifically , de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) adopted fully sampled ssp models to determine the lmc cluster population s properties , while popescu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) took into account the effects of stochastically sampled stellar mfs , which become particularly noticeable for cluster masses below a few @xmath4 m@xmath5 ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) . given that these studies all used the same basic cluster photometry , it is instructive to first compare chandar et al.s ( 2010a , b ) results with those of de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) , since both teams based their parameter determinations on the same underlying physical assumptions ( barring small differences between the actual ssp models used , which we discuss below where relevant ) .",
    "we will then proceed by properly taking into account the effects of stochastic sampling of the clusters stellar mfs , which is arguably a physically sounder assumption for lower - mass clusters .",
    "this debate goes beyond the mere niche of the question as to how star cluster populations evolve .",
    "most importantly , it touches upon the process in which disrupting star clusters populate their host galaxy s galactic field . at present ,",
    "two competing theories hold sway in this area .",
    "one supports the idea that early star cluster disruption is independent of cluster mass and does not depend on the clusters environment either ( e.g. , chandar et al .",
    "2010a , b ; fall & chandar 2012 ) , which must be contrasted with the view that environmental differences lead to different cluster disruption signatures , which may also exhibit a dependence on cluster mass ( e.g. , de grijs & goodwin 2008 , 2009 , and references therein ; see also lamers 2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we will show that , at least for the lmc and for the data set in common among all competing studies ( hunter et al .",

    "substantial cluster disruption at early times ( @xmath6 yr ) . in section [ bigpicture.sec ]",
    ", we will place these results in a more general context .",
    "in de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) we compared the physical parameters of the lmc s star cluster population obtained from resolved photometry and spectroscopy on the one hand and integrated seds on the other .",
    "this was necessarily restricted to age comparisons of the more massive lmc sample clusters , as constrained by the availability of prior age determinations in the literature at that time . using our analysed tool for star cluster analysis based on broad - band seds assuming fully populated stellar mfs ( anders et al .",
    "2004b ) , we re - analysed the current most comprehensive database of integrated lmc cluster photometry ( hunter et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "prior to this , we had already concluded ( de grijs et al . 2005 ) that application of the analysed approach based on standard modelling employing the galev ssp models ( kotulla et al .",
    "2009 ; and references therein , as well as subsequent , unpublished updates ) showed that the _ relative _ masses within a given cluster system can be determined to very high accuracy ( provided that the clusters stellar mfs are well - populated ) , depending on the specific combination of passbands used ( anders et al .",
    "2004b ) . under the conditions explored in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we found that the _ absolute _ accuracy with which the cluster mass distribution can be reproduced using different model approaches ( including different ssp models , filter combinations , and input physics ) is @xmath7 , compared with @xmath8 for the age distribution : `` [ t]his implies that mass determinations are mostly insensitive to the approach adopted '' ( de grijs et al .",
    "2005 ) , because the mass - to - light ratio of a given ssp depends only weakly on the population s age , at least within reasonably narrow age ranges . in any cluster analysis",
    "used to derive ages and masses , the age uncertainties are , by far , the most significant .",
    "driven by a number of controversies that had appeared in the literature ( chandar , fall & whitmore 2006 ; gieles , lamers & portegies zwart 2007 ) , we proceeded to apply our analysis approach to the smc s star cluster system ( de grijs & goodwin 2008 ) , based on hunter et al.s ( 2003 ) broad - band magnitudes .",
    "we concluded that the optically selected smc star cluster population has undergone at most @xmath9 per cent disruption between the age ranges of approximately [ 310 ] myr and [ 40160 ] myr , a process often referred to as ` infant mortality . '",

    "they suggest that a scenario in which clusters undergo gradual , mass - independent disruption up to @xmath13 gyr provides the best match to the data",
    ". however , baumgardt et al . (",
    "2013 ) recently concluded that significant cluster disruption appears to set in only after an age of @xmath14 myr ( see also de grijs & goodwin 2009 ) .",
    "this latter conclusion is consistent with the results of parmentier & de grijs ( 2008 ) .",
    "neither of these latter authors focussed on the evolution of the youngest clusters , however , nor did baumgardt et al .",

    "addressing these two aspects is what we set out to do here .",

    ", we explained that the main uncertainties introduced by adopting this method are owing to fluctuations caused by small - number statistics in the youngest age range and the exact length of the youngest age range , for which we adopted a minimum age for optically visible clusters of 3 myr .",

    "the small apparent difference between the canonical and best - fitting slopes in panel ( b )  although they are still comparable within the formal statistical uncertainties  is likely owing to the appearance of red supergiants in this age range , combined with the possible effects of stochasticity .",
    "( the presence of red supergiants in stochastically sampled clusters will cause sed fits based on fully sampled imfs to return cluster masses that are biased towards higher values . ) stochastic sampling effects are also the likely cause for the @xmath3@xmath20 slope discrepancy seen in panel ( h ) . based on this analysis alone",

    "that the cluster formation rate has remained roughly constant ( within 10 per cent for @xmath12 yr ; cf .",
    "maschberger & kroupa 2011 ; see also section [ bigpicture.sec ] ) , we conclude on the basis of fig .",
    "[ lmcclf.fig ] that there is no compelling evidence of significant mortality , either infant mortality or disruption up to @xmath22 myr and within the poissonian uncertainties . in the next section",

    "both predictions also include the usual effects of stellar evolution and fading , i.e. , they follow standard ssp evolution as implemented in the galev models .",
    "just as for the smc cluster system , if we force it to pass through the data point associated with the youngest age range , the blue , long - dashed arrow does not appear to describe _ any _ of the trends even remotely satisfactorily for ages up to @xmath23 yr .",

    "[ dndt_comp.fig ] we reproduce the lmc cluster age distribution based on the full de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) sample ( fig .",

    "these authors provide ages , extinction values and integrated @xmath29-band photometry for all clusters in their sample ; although they do not state specifically whether their @xmath29-band magnitudes have been extinction - corrected , our interpretation of their description is that they are ( but this makes a negligible difference to our results , in any case ) .",
    "reassuringly , all three distributions exhibit the same overall behaviour and even their absolute scaling renders the distributions virtually indistinguishable .",
    "all three samples , based on two independent photometric catalogues and three independently determined age distributions , are consistent with an age distribution for ages up to @xmath30 yr that is best described by simple stellar evolution ( i.e. , evolutionary fading ) , without the need for additional disruption . in all three cases ,",
    "the slope of the distribution becomes significantly steeper only for ages in excess of 100 myr , where we are likely witnessing the onset of dynamical disruption ( cf . boutloukos & lamers 2003 ; lamers et al .",

    "( 2010a ) distribution is ` negatively curved ' , compared with the ` positively curved ' age distributions resulting from the three catalogues considered in this paper . in fact , this appearance is predominantly driven by chandar et al.s ( 2010a ) youngest age bin , which exhibits a clear excess in cluster numbers compared with the youngest age bin in the other distributions discussed in this context .",
    "we will explore the background to this apparent discrepancy in the next section .",
    "note that one of the main differences between our results and those of chandar et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) is driven by our respective analysis methods .",

    "the differences between both sets of results therefore hinge on the treatment of the data points pertaining to the youngest ages .",

    "( 2010a ) based their broad - band sed fits on the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ssps for @xmath35 , a salpeter ( 1955)-type imf and fitzpatrick s ( 1999 ) galactic extinction law .",
    "although de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) and popescu et al .",

    "( 2010a ) on the one hand and de grijs & anders ( 2006 ) and popescu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on the other resides in the choice of stellar imf .",
    "the latter studies used a kroupa ( 2002)-type imf , which would yield lower cluster masses by a factor of @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 dex ) compared to the use of a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "however , chandar et al . ( 2010a ) argue that this difference is offset by the need to apply aperture corrections to the original integrated cluster photometry , thus eventually leading to similar masses .",
    "finally , we note that the youngest isochrone in the galev ssp models is characterized by an age of @xmath38 , whereas the youngest object in chandar et al .",

    "( 2012 ) data sets , although in these instances the latter authors obtained best - fitting parameters corresponding to older , more massive clusters .",
    "such discrepancies can be traced back to the well - known age ",
    "extinction(metallicity ) degeneracy and are not a real reason for serious concerns in the context of this paper .",
    "thus , while some of the lower - mass clusters of chandar et al .",

    "yet , it is this subsample of clusters that drives the controversy and the conclusion that significant cluster disruption may affect the lmc cluster sample from the youngest ages onwards .",
    "based on the comparison performed here , we are forced to conclude that , in retrospect , this claim appears to be unwarranted . in the following , we will attempt to place this conclusion on a firmer quantitative footing .",
    "for any of the mass - limited subsamples , significant disruption does not occur until @xmath40 yr ( cf . parmentier & de grijs 2008 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2013 ) ; for the full lmc cluster sample , one could argue that some effects of disruption , in addition to evolutionary fading , start to appear for @xmath41 .",

    "irrespective of the effects of infant mortality , if any , clusters evolve owing to stellar evolution and two - body relaxation according to the formalism of lamers et al .",
    "the fraction of the mass of a cluster with initial mass @xmath44 that is still bound at age @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass lost through stellar evolution , @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the ` tidal ' parameter @xmath51 , defined as the normalization factor of the disruption time - scale , @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 in our model ; cf .",

    "note that we model such evolution using the analytic prescription of lamers et al .",
    "in reality , the @xmath51 parameter would vary with position and time , which may lead to some ( possibly significant ) differences to the cluster disruption properties and time - scales at different galactocentric radii ( see , e.g. , bastian et al .",
    "a small amount of additional disruption ( either infant mortality or dynamical dissolution ) could be accommodated by the data , but there is no need to do so . where our models include the effects of infant mortality , this is implemented by the removal of a given fraction ( as specified in the text ) of the star cluster population at an age of 10 myr , irrespective of cluster mass .",

    "one can , of course , vary past cluster - formation rates and different prescriptions of cluster mortality ( infant or otherwise ) to find a good fit to the observations .",
    "for example , a generally decreasing cluster - formation rate but with periods of enhanced cluster formation in the past 100  myr provides a good fit without the need to invoke infant mortality .",
    "vastly increased cluster formation 50300  myr ago with significant infant mortality can also produce a reasonable fit ( even though such a scenario predicts almost no 2050  myr - old clusters ) .",
    "an acceptable fit can also be obtaind with significant cluster mortality occurring at 100  myr rather than 10  myr .",
    "however , without a good physical reason to think that these are reasonable models , particularly in the absence of supporting evidence for such scenarios based on independent studies ( see also section [ bigpicture.sec ] ) , we argue that it is rather pointless to pursue such fits .",
    "we have thus far specifically focussed on a detailed and thorough ( re-)analysis of the lmc cluster population as covered by the hunter et al . (",
    "2003 ) database . since a number of different authors reached conflicting conclusions as regards the early evolution of the galaxy s cluster system , but based on the same basic photometric data set , our aim was to explore the underlying reasons for this discrepancy . in this section ,",
    "we take the discussion further by addressing the more general context associated with this work . in particular",

    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) analysed integrated @xmath85 photometry from a pre - publication release of bica et al.s ( 1996 ) catalogue and concluded that the lmc s evolutionary history is characterized by periods of enhanced cluster formation , by a factor of @xmath86 , at @xmath22 myr and 12 gyr , as well as by the well - known , pronounced ` age gap ' between @xmath87 and [ 1215 ] gyr ( see below ) .",
    "pietrzyski & udalski ( 2000 ) used ischrone fits to determine ages of up to 1.2 gyr of 600 clusters in the central lmc ( bar ) area .",
    "they concluded that the lmc cluster - formation rate is characterized by a number of bursts with complex age structure , specifically centred at ages of @xmath88 , 125 and 800 myr .",
    "the most recent period of enhanced cluster formation produced of order a factor of 1.52 more clusters per unit ( linear ) age range than the equivalent rate during the galaxy s more quiescent period(s ) , while the burst centred at @xmath89 myr produced cluster numbers boosted by yet another factor of @xmath90  when we smooth the pietrzyski & udalski ( 2000 ) cluster age distribution to the same resolution as adopted in this paper .",
    "however , the empirically derived cluster age distribution is the product of cluster formation _ and _ disruption as a function of time . adopting the cluster age distribution as proxy of a galaxy s cluster-_formation _ history only yields , therefore , merely part of the story .",
    "a roughly constant age distribution could therefore imply a similarly shaped cluster - formation history , but it could also result from a balanced interplay between cluster formation and disruption .    a number of authors have suggested that the lmc s resolved stellar population could provide clues as to the galaxy s cluster - formation history based on cmd analysis ( for a recent discussion , see maschberger & kroupa 2011 ) , provided that the star- and cluster - formation histories can be mapped onto one another within reasonably small uncertainties .",
    "however , ( massive ) cluster and field - star formation may well require different conditions to thrive in , implying that the two formation scenarios may not always be coincident .",
    "this type of scenario is likely , in fact , given the observed disparities between the cluster and field - star age distributions in , e.g. , the magellanic clouds as well as in ngc 1569 ( e.g. , anders et al .",
    "in particular , the lmc exhibits a well - known gap in the cluster age distribution , although the age distribution of the field stellar population appears more continuous ( e.g. , olszewski et al .",
    "1996 ; geha et al . 1998 ; sarajedini 1998 ; and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the cluster and field - star age distributions are also significantly different in the smc ( cf . rafelski & zaritsky 2005 ; gieles et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "maschberger & kroupa ( 2011 ) recently performed a very careful and detailed study of the lmc s cluster - formation history ( based on the ages and masses from de grijs & anders 2006 ) and its relationship , if any , to the galaxy s field - star formation history .",
    "they compared the lmc s star - formation history based on cmd analysis ( using observational data from harris & zaritsky 2009 ) with the galaxy s cluster - formation history resulting from consideration of both the most massive clusters only ( cf . maschberger & kroupa 2007 ) and of the total mass in clusters of any mass , although in the latter case they could trace only the most recent [ 20400 ] myr period .",
    "these authors found that the shape of the resulting cluster - formation history matches that of the field - star formation history based on cmd analysis very well for the past @xmath67 yr ( cf .",

    "once again , therefore , these results based on empirical cluster age distributions are affected by a degeneracy between cluster formation and disruption scenarios .",
    "the precise shape of the most recent lmc cluster - formation history derived by maschberger & kroupa ( 2011 ) depends ultimately on whether or not the actively star - forming region centred on 30 doradus ( 30 dor ) and its massive central cluster r136 are included in the models . the hunter et al .",

    "we thus conclude that the cluster disruption rate in the lmc , at least over the past 100 myr , has been well below that found for large and/or interacting galaxies like the antennae system ( whitmore , chandar & fall 2007 ; and references therein ) , m51 ( bastian et al . 2005 ) , and the milky way ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
