    "formation of primordial objects such as young galaxies and globular clusters , in the early universe is a fundamental problem in the modern cosmology .",
    "there was a rapid progress of observations in the last years .",
    "it gave theoreticians invaluable possibility to compare their theories with the observations .",
    "now , we can say that the framework of the structure formation is well known . however , there are still many unanswered questions , especially regarding the influence of the background radiation field from the first objects to the star formation rate . in our work",
    "we are trying to answer this question .",
    "the existence of the first objects is a direct consequence of the growth of the primordial density fluctuations . at the beginning , there are linear density perturbations which expand with the overall hubble flow .",
    "subsequently , these perturbations can grow and form primordial clouds .",
    "clouds with enough density contrast decouple from this flow and start to collapse .",
    "the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is dissipated through shocks and the cloud becomes pressure supported .",
    "the further evolution of the cloud is determined by its ability to cool sufficiently fast .",
    "clouds which could not cool fast enough will stay in a pressure - supported stage and will not form any stars .",
    "the existence of the efficient cooling mechanism is necessary to continue the collapse of the cloud , its subsequent fragmentation and star formation .    in our work",
    "we are interested in the first generation of stars , say iii population , which are still forming in the low mass clouds when first luminous objects already exist .",
    "these objects are made from the primordial gas so they are metals free .",
    "it is simply because the first stars did not have much time to produce them .",
    "these objects could be irradiated by the uv and x - rays radiation produced by the first stars , quasars and hypothetical super heavy dark matter ( shdm ) particle decays ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the absence of metals , the most important cooling mechanism for low - mass primordial clouds",
    "is so called @xmath0 cooling , i.e. cooling by radiation of excited rotational and vibrational states of @xmath0 molecule .",
    "we can look at this mechanism as the collisional excitation of the @xmath0 molecule , subsequent spontaneous de - excitation and photon emission .",
    "emitted photon can further escape from the cloud and take away kinetic energy of the collapsing cloud .",
    "the presence of initial mass fraction of the molecular hydrogen @xmath0 of only @xmath1 is enough to trigger the final collapse of low mass clouds .",
    "molecular hydrogen is fragile and can easily be photodissociated by photons with energies of 11.26 - 13.6 ev ( lyman and werner bands)(@xcite ) through the following reactions @xmath2 destruction of the @xmath0 would stop collapsing of the low mass clouds and decrease star formation rate .    in primordial gas cloud , @xmath0 molecules can form mainly through the coupled reactions @xmath3 in which the electrons act only as a catalyst .",
    "x - rays radiation can increase production of the @xmath0 by enhancement of free electrons fraction .    from above",
    "we see that the uv and x - rays radiation background alters the subsequent growth of cosmic structures .",
    "it regulates star formation rate so it has important implication to the re - ionization history of the universe .",
    "in addition photoionization by uv photons can be regarded as the process which lead to the inhibition of the low mass galaxies formation , so it could explain the so called low - mass galaxies overproduction problem in the hierarchical bottom - up theory of galaxy formation .",
    "it is therefore crucial to determine quantitatively the consequences of radiation feedback on the formation of early generation objects .",
    "feedback of the uv background to the collapse of the spherically symmetric primordial gas cloud in cdm model was studied by many authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however",
    ", their calculations were simplified .",
    "they have been using self - shielding function ( @xcite ) instead of solving the full transfer equation .",
    "our approach includes solving the frequency - dependent radiative transfer equation in the exact way .",
    "we try to check the evolution of the collapsing cloud in the @xmath4cdm and mond model .",
    "in cold dark matter models and in case of spherical symmetry , the collapse may be described by the following equations :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the radius of a sphere of mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath9 is pressure and @xmath10 is mass density . here ,",
    "eq.([ciaglosc ] ) is the continuity equation , ( [ promien ] ) and ( [ predkosc ] ) give acceleration and ( [ energia ] ) accounts for energy conservation .",
    "the last term in eq.([energia ] ) describes gas cooling / heating , where @xmath4 is energy absorption ( emission ) rate per unit volume .",
    "@xmath4 consist of two parts , that is , the chemical cooling @xmath11 and the radiative cooling @xmath12 : @xmath13 the @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the chemical binding energy per unit mass .",
    "the radiative cooling @xmath17 is obtained by solving radiative transfer equation .",
    "we use the equation of state of perfect gas    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , as the primordial baryonic matter after recombination is assumed to be composed mainly of monoatomic hydrogen and helium , with the fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath20 always less than @xmath21 .    in the case of",
    "modified gravity@xcite , equation ( [ predkosc ] ) will change :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is some function , asymptotically equal to @xmath24 for @xmath25 and to @xmath26 for @xmath27 , while @xmath28 may be expressed as    @xmath29 r . \\label{gh}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath30 is the current value of the hubble parameter , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the current fractions of baryons , radiation and dark energy in terms of the critical density of the universe , and @xmath34 is the redshift . we have made similar assumption like in @xcite and we apply mond to net acceleration over hubble flow only .",
    "the time - independent , non - relativistic equation for radiation transport in spherical geometry can be written : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the intensity of radiation of frequency @xmath37 , at radius @xmath6 and in the direction @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the angle between the outward normal and photon direction . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the total emissivity and opacity at frequency @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 can be expressed as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are thermal emissivity , scattering emissivity , true absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient at frequency @xmath37 respectively .    following hummer and rybicki @xcite",
    ", we introduce a more convenient system of coordinates @xmath47 rather than @xmath48 defined by the transformation formulae @xmath49 for a given radius @xmath6 the impact parameter @xmath9 can vary between 0 and @xmath6 . because the parameter @xmath9 can not distinguish between @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", the radiation intensity @xmath52 have to be separated into outward @xmath53 and inward @xmath54 directed intensity : @xmath55    now , in the new system of coordinates eq.([sfer ] ) can be written as two separate equations @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the source function .",
    "if we introduce @xcite @xmath59 than eqs.([one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) will get the form @xmath60    to solve these equations we need also a boundary condition .",
    "we consider a spherical envelope with an inner boundary at radius @xmath61 and an outer boundary @xmath62 .",
    "the cloud is immersed in an external time dependent , isotropic radiation field .",
    "we obtain the following boundary condition @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 describe the changes of the radiation at frequency @xmath37 impinging upon the inner and the outer boundary with the time @xmath66 .    by the standard procedure one",
    "obtains from eq.([sfer ] ) the zeroth and the first moment equations @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the eddington factor .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the zeroth , first and second moment of the radiation field at frequency @xmath37 : @xmath72    we can cast eq.([m0 ] ) into a more convenient form , by introducing a sphericality factor @xmath73 , defined in the following way : @xmath74 \\textrm{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the core radius , that is , the inner boundary of the medium . using this factor and making some simplification we can rewrite eqs.([m0 ] ) and ( [ m1 ] ) as @xmath76    the corresponding boundary conditions for the moment equations ( [ ma0 ] ) and ( [ ma1 ] ) )",
    "can be written as follows @xcite @xmath77    we see that these boundary condition can be determined only after eqs.([t1 ] ) and([t2 ] ) have been solved for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "in the following sections we shall refer to eqs.([t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) along with the boundary conditions ( [ w2 ] ) as system i equations . the moment equations ( [ ma0 ] ) and ( [ ma1 ] ) along with the boundary condition ( [ w0 ] ) , ( [ w1 ] ) will henceforth be referred as system ii equations .",
    "solution of the radiative energy transfer equations gives us information about the luminosity function @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82    with the given luminosity we can calculate radiative part of cooling function @xmath12 : @xmath83 it can be used further in the hydrodynamical equations .",
    "in our calculations , we include all of the relevant thermal and chemical processes in the primordial gas .",
    "we have taken into account nine species : h , h@xmath84 , h@xmath85 , he , he@xmath85 ,",
    "he@xmath86 , h@xmath87 , h@xmath88 and e@xmath84 . their abundance varies with time due to chemical reactions , ionization and dissociation photoprocesses .",
    "the chemical reactions include such processes as ionization of hydrogen and helium by electrons , recombination of ions with electrons , formation of negative hydrogen ions , formation of h@xmath87 molecules , etc .",
    "a full list of the relevant chemical reactions and appropriate formulae is given in @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the number density of component @xmath89 is described by the kinetic equation :    @xmath90    the first component on the right - hand side of this equation describes the chemical reactions , and the other one accounts for photoionization and photodissociation processes .",
    "coefficients @xmath91 are reaction rates , quantities @xmath92 are photoionization or photodissociation rates , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are numbers equal to 0 , @xmath95 or @xmath96 depending on the reaction .",
    "all reaction rates , as well as photoionization and photodissociation rates are given in @xcite .",
    "the cooling ( or heating ) function @xmath4 includes effects of collisional ionization of h , he and he@xmath85 , recombination to h , he and he@xmath85 , collisional excitation of h and he@xmath85 , bremsstrahlung , compton cooling and cooling by de - excitation of h@xmath87 molecules .",
    "the heating / cooling rates are given in @xcite .",
    "in the simulations we used the code described in @xcite , based on those presented by @xcite and @xcite . this is a standard , one - dimensional , second - order accurate , lagrangian finite - difference scheme , slightly modified to our purposes .",
    "our code supports flat and non - flat cdm and @xmath4cdm models as well as milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics . in the second case it was necessary to do significant changes in the initial conditions .",
    "we starte our calculations at the end of the radiation - dominated era instead of @xmath97 . for @xmath98 , @xmath99 as given by the formula provided by @xcite , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 k , assuming @xmath102 and @xmath103=2.7277 k. we assume that in mond , like in the standard cosmology , initial overdensities may grow only in the matter - dominated era . in both cases we use our own code to calculate the initial chemical composition and initial gas temperature .",
    "initial overdensities may be calculated from the matter power spectrum which may be obtained e.g. using the cmbfast program by @xcite .",
    "we apply the initial density profiles in the form of a single spherical fourier mode , also used by @xcite    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath106 , with @xmath107 being the actual value of the hubble parameter .    for this profile , we can distinguish two radius values , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which correspond to the first zero and the first minimum of the function @xmath110 , respectively . inside the sphere of radius @xmath111 which contains mass @xmath112 ,",
    "the local density contrast is positive .",
    "the mass @xmath112 and the radius @xmath108 will be referred to as the cloud mass and the cloud radius , respectively .",

    "the shell of radius @xmath109 will expand together with the hubble flow , not undergoing any additional deceleration .",
    "this is why this profile is very convenient in numerical simulations .",
    "it eliminates the numerical edge effects and the mentioned shell simply follows the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , it can be regarded as the perturbation boundary , with mass @xmath115 referred to as the bound mass .",

    ", we use the hubble velocity :    @xmath119    our numerical computational procedure to trace the dynamical evolution of the primordial cloud under the uv background is following :    * we solve the hydrodynamic equations of motion along with equations for energy conservation , ionization , and dissociation of molecular and atomic species . from the solution of these equations we can calculate the properties and distribution of the absorbing components @xmath120 , @xmath121 and the thermal emissivity @xmath122 .",

    "* we solve the system ii equations for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . *",
    "the source function is independent from the radiation field ( @xmath69 ) only when there is no light scattering .",

    "we update abundance of different species and number densities of each atomic and molecular state . *",
    "we repeat all of the above steps .",
