    "quantum computation is possibly the up most application goal of quantum mechanics in nowadays .",
    "feynmann devised this relation based on use of quantum properties to speed up the simulation of computational problems by physical systems @xcite .",
    "thus , processing based on quantum algorithms , useful developments using quantum information processing have been effectively developed as theoretically as experimentally : quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "quantum gate array computation is the most common , direct and clear approach in terms of proximity with classical computing .",
    "their similitude is based on the use of computer gates replicated from classical programming .",
    "this gates are reproduced by several designs in terms of physical resources where they have been carried out : ion traps and electromagnetic cavities @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and spins @xcite . nevertheless , their translation to theoretical gates is not always immediate , requiring control or iterative procedures .",
    "teleportation is a physical process now in the public domain by its attractiveness . in it",
    ", a quantum state can be transferred to other using a previously shared entangled pair , with assistance of classical communications and local operations . in @xcite , a bell state",
    "is used to this goal together with hadamard , @xmath0 and @xmath1 gates .",
    "departing from this development , many proposals and goals have been made to transfer a multi - qubit state , inclusively in the experimental terrain @xcite .",
    "teleportation has been accomplished among optical systems @xcite , photons and a single atomic ensemble @xcite and trapped atomic ions using coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , teleportation is commonly considered as one of the most striking progresses of quantum information theory .",
    "ising model @xcite is used as a simple approach to magnetic interaction between quantm objects ( electronic gases , quantum dots , ions , etc . ) .",
    "nielsen @xcite was the first reporting studies of entanglement between magnetic systems based on a two spin systems driven with an external magnetic field .",
    "one property of this model is that it generates entanglement , one of the more interesting properties of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this property is a central aspect in the most of quantum applications , because its non local properties improve capacity and speed information processing @xcite .",
    "control of entanglement is achievable in ising model through of driven magnetic fields being introduced on the physical system .",
    "this is the case for teleportation .",
    "different models of ising interaction ( @xmath2 depending on interest of each author and physical systems being considered ) are used to reproduce effects related with bipartite or multipartite systems @xcite and quantum dots @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , quantum gate array computation is being experimentally explored to adapt it to stuff in which it can be settled , particularly in terms of noise control and reproduction of computational gates .",
    "it means , the interactions able to be considered to reproduce them @xcite .",
    "quantum dots and electronic gases are developments towards a scalable spin - based quantum computer , which can be controlled with electromagnetic interactions among neighboring spins to obtain universal quantum operations @xcite in terms of divincenzo criteria @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is apply some non local properties recently reported by @xcite in the anisotropic ising model and some control procedures on it @xcite , which naturally reproduces non local gates useful for teleportation .",
    "these gates reduce teleportation algorithm to a driven magnetic interaction based on matter to transfer spin quantum states . several variants of this process are presented , thus as their extension to multiple qubits teleportation .",
    "the use of magnetic systems as quantum resources is a basis on which quantum applications could be settled . from quantum memories to quantum processors ,",
    "matter susceptible of magnetic control is considered as stuff for quantum computation or quantum information processing .",
    "particularly , ising model , is a simple model of interaction bringing an easy basis to generate and manipulate quantum states and entanglement particularly . in this model ,",
    "as is shown in the upper part of figure [ fig1 ] , two qubits interact via ising interaction using additional local magnetic fields as driven elements .",
    "some results about anisotropic ising model generalize their treatment and suggest an algebraic structure when it is depicted on bell basis @xcite . following this work ,",
    "we focus on the following hamiltonian for the bipartite anisotropic ising model including an inhomogeneous magnetic field restricted to the @xmath3-direction ( @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath5 respectively ) :    @xmath6    which includes several models considered in the previously cited works . following the definitions and the notation adopted in @xcite , we introduce the scaled parameters :    @xmath7 \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber   { \\rm with : } & & j_{\\ { h \\}\\pm } \\equiv { j_{i , j}}_\\pm = j_i \\pm j_j \\\\ \\nonumber   & & b_{h \\pm}=b_{1_h}\\pm b_{2_h } \\\\",

    "additionally , we introduce the same nomenclature introduced in @xcitebased on different subscripts than those inherited by the computational basis : greek scripts for @xmath11 or @xmath12 , for scripts in states and operators ( meaning @xmath11 in mathematical expressions respectively ) ; capital scripts @xmath13 for @xmath14 as in the computational basis ; and latin scripts @xmath15 for spatial directions",
    "@xmath5 or @xmath9 .",
    "bell states become in last notation :    @xmath16      in agreement with last notation , energy levels in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are denoted by eigenvalues @xmath17 and they are :    @xmath18    with their eigenvectors reported in @xcite .",
    "as there , by introducing the following definitions :    @xmath19    the evolution operators in bell basis are in matrix form :    @xmath20 \\label{mathamiltonian2 } { u_{2}}(t)= & \\left ( \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c } e^{i { \\delta_2}_+^+}{{e_2}_+^+}^ *     &    0    &    0    & - e^{i { \\delta_2}_+^+}{d_2}_+   \\\\ \\hline 0   &   e^{i { \\delta_2}_-^+}{{e_2}_-^+}^ * &   -e^{i { \\delta_2}_-^+}{{d_2}_- }   & 0         \\\\ \\hline 0   &   e^{i { \\delta_2}_-^+}{{d_2}_- } &   e^{i { \\delta_2}_-^+}{{e_2}_-^+ }   & 0            \\\\ \\hline e^{i { \\delta_2}_+^+}{d_2}_+     &    0    &    0    & e^{i { \\delta_2}_+^+}{{e_2}_+^+ }    \\end{array }   \\right ) & \\in { \\bf s}^*_2 \\\\[3 mm ] \\label{mathamiltonian3 } { u_{3}}(t)= & \\left ( \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c } e^{i { \\delta_3}_-^+}{{e_3}_-^+}^ * & 0 & i e^{i { \\delta_3}_-^+}{d_3}_-       & 0         \\\\ \\hline 0   &   e^{i { \\delta_3}_+^+}{{e_3}_+^+}^ * & 0 & i e^{i { \\delta_3}_+^+}{d_3}_+            \\\\",

    "thus , @xmath21 belongs to subgroups : @xmath24 ( defined in @xcite ) .",
    "these subgroups are characterized by their block structure and properties inherited from ( [ mathamiltonian1]-[mathamiltonian3 ] ) when @xmath25 are fixed .",
    "then , these subgroups have a semidirect product structure : @xmath26 .",
    "thus , identity and inverses are included in each subgroup , while there are closure in the product . at same time , quantum states in @xmath27 become split in a direct sum of two subspaces generated each one by pairs of bell states .",
    "this structure is essential in the current work because it assures the existence of solutions in their control .",
    "blocks are elements of @xmath28 as is reported in @xcite .",
    "their general structure is :    @xmath29    being @xmath3 the spatial direction of magnetic field associated ; @xmath30 an ordering label for each block as it appears in the rows of the evolution matrix ; @xmath31 are the labels for its rows in @xmath32 ( by example , in @xmath33 , @xmath34 labels for the rows of second block , @xmath35 , in @xmath36 ) .",
    "note that @xmath37 is unitary .",
    "last structure lets introduce generation of control operations in terms of factorization of special unitary matrices in @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "as was reported in @xcite , controlled gates on each block could be constructed in two pulses :    @xmath39    for that purpose , one block should be diagonalized into @xmath40 and another block antidiagonalized into @xmath41 or @xmath42(which forms straight assumed wrote for the bell basis instead for the computational basis ) . prescriptions to achieve last forms on each block were obtained by @xcite and they are :    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 corresponds to diagonal block and @xmath46 to antidiagonal one .",
    "also , @xmath47 .",
    "these prescriptions let to obtain the design parameters @xmath48 in terms of strengths @xmath49 .",
    "note that parameters @xmath50 should fulfill positivity restrictions .",
    "if @xmath51 are the respective blocks @xmath45 ( diagonal ) and @xmath46 ( antidiagonal ) for @xmath52 . then , last prescriptions generate the combined blocks in @xmath53 :    @xmath54    with @xmath55 becoming an integer or a semi - integer in terms of the additional condition :    @xmath56    which shows that @xmath55 is a semi - integer for @xmath57 .",
    "driven ising interaction generate generalized controlled gates presented in @xcite , @xmath59 .",
    "first ones are near related with evolution loops combined with phase gates .",
    "second ones are more like to @xmath60 gates used in traditional gate array quantum computation . when @xmath61 , they are simply the matrices @xmath62 obtained from combination ( in the structure of @xmath32 ) of exactly each one of blocks in ( [ sectors1]-[sectors2 ] ) with @xmath63 even :    @xmath64    last suggests they can be used as natural operations replacing some standard gates if computing is done using non local quantum resources ( remember that last expressions are based on non local bell basis ) .",
    "one immediate application is the teleportation algorithm .",
    "we begin , as commonly , with the state @xmath65 with the first qubit to teleport and in possession of alice .",
    "bell state is first in possession of bob , who send his first part to alice .",
    "then , alice drives and ising interaction as in our model , applying by example , @xmath58 operation between the qubits in their current possession . with just this , they almost obtain the standard teleportation algorithm for one qubit @xcite :    @xmath66    where for simplicity , to identify easily the results in computational basis , we comeback at this point to the traditional notation for bell states .",
    "figure 2a and 2b show two alternatives of the algorithm using the gate @xmath67 , which is substituting the traditional @xmath68 operation on computational basis .",
    "after to apply ising interaction , alice makes a measurement , by example in the computational basis on their qubits .",
    "results are listed in table [ tab1 ] , where @xmath69 are the eigenstates of @xmath70 ( teleportated state column in table 1 ) .",
    "clearly a hadamard gate is necessary at the end and in addition , if measurement result is @xmath71 , then it is required to apply @xmath72 to teleportate the original qubit 1 on qubit 3 ( @xmath73 are in the traditional computational basis , not in the @xmath74 notation ) .",
    "thus , alice uses classical communication to send their outcomes to bob , who finally applies the adequate gates ( complementary gates column in table 1 ) to obtain exactly ( until unitary factors ) the original state @xmath75 , as is shown in table 1 and figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "there , @xmath76 are the traditional gates in computational basis , which should be applied on qubit 3 as is depicted in table 1",
    ". we use these symbols to distinguish from @xmath77 previously used ( with exception of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ) , which are only matrix forms written for the bell states corresponding to each subspace in the direct sum decomposition of @xmath27 .",
    "another alternative for alice and bob is to make a measurement in bell basis @xmath78 ( for both notations ) . in such case",
    ", bob will need to apply @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 ) or @xmath81 ( in the traditional notation @xmath73 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows this procedure .",
    ".[tab1 ] measurement outcomes in two different basis , output state and complementary gates for teleportation algorithm based on @xmath58 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      last example has shown that gate @xmath58 reproduce the traditional teleportation algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , it can be achieved with any @xmath82 gate . following the steps in the last subsection ,",
    "it is possible show that with any of these gates ( for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath83 ) and inclusively if initial bell state used is @xmath84 instead of @xmath85 as before , teleportation procedure can be achieved if we use the following complementary gates ( assuming non local measurements based on bell states , @xmath86 ) :    @xmath87    the generalization of last procedure for a multiqubit state is easy . in the figures 2 and 3 ,",
    "we define the procedure @xmath88 as a map from @xmath89 on @xmath90 ( here , @xmath90 is a two level hilbert space ) :    @xmath91    we can note that it is linear in the original state :    @xmath92    while , state @xmath93 is separable from the remaining state @xmath94 . in the last expressions ,",
    "the subscripts are the labels for each one of the three qubits involved .",
    "then , generalization is obvious .",
    "if we have the @xmath95-qubit state :    @xmath96    to teleportate , then , if we use the following state for the ancilla qubits :    @xmath97    and we apply the teleportation protocol @xmath98 on qubits @xmath99 ( here , each @xmath98 could be @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) :    @xmath102    note in particular that not all single qubit teleportation algorithms can be the same type as well as the bell state @xmath103 being used for each one .",
    "equal signs used in ( [ multi ] ) are until unitary factors .",
    "these results show that controlled ising model reproduces equivalent standard gates proposed in quantum teleportation .",
    "optics has been partially a dominant arena to developments in quantum information and quantum computation . nevertheless , quantum storage and massive processing of information are tasks abler to develop on matter based quantum systems .",
    "systems based on trapped ions , e - helium , nuclear magnetic resonance , superconductors , doped silicon and quantum dots are developments on this trend , showing possibilities to set up stable and efficient implementations of those technologies @xcite . thus , spin - based quantum computing has been developed in through experimental implementations using magnetic systems mainly and exploiting ising interactions with different approaches @xcite , together with control on quantum states , in particular entanglement control .",
    "the procedure analyzed in this paper shows how ising interaction could be controlled to generate gates able to produce teleportation . because its linearity , these scheme shows the same generalization that traditional algorithm @xcite .",
    "in addition , the different paths provided in the analysis , in terms of the bell states used as resources and the field direction stated to generate the controlled gates , open other future research directions .",
    "one is the analysis of control in the process and its fidelity in terms of control parameters ( interaction and fields strengths , time intervals ) .",
    "one more is about flexibility , as was stated in @xcite , in terms of viability to use resources with discriminate them , it means , to achieve teleportation independently the knowledge about non local resource being used .",
    "finally , extensions to optimize the economy in terms of non local resources used in the process is open as in the general teleportation trend ."
