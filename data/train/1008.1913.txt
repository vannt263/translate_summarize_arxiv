    "when a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is subject to a large magnetic field , the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) regime is accessed .",
    "here charge transport is allowed by the formation of edge - state channels , each accounting for a single quantum of conductance . as pointed out for the first time in refs .  , this system became the prototype of a single - channel conductor with spectacular properties such as chirality and adiabatic transport , whose study fueled an enormous amount of work in the field of nanoscience@xcite .",
    "recently , phase - coherence was studied and found to be preserved over rather long distances , of the order of more than 10 micrometers @xcite .",
    "for this reason 2degs in the iqh regime appear to be specially suited for electronic interferometry , a very stimulating phenomenon both for basic science and for its various possible applications .",
    "a recent breakthrough in this field has been the experimental realization of electronic mach - zehnder  @xcite and hanbury - brown and twiss  @xcite interferometers . in these experiments electrons in the edge states loop around an annular structure mimicking the optical paths of their photonic counterparts .",
    "recently , a new theoretical scheme was proposed@xcite which would allow for a concatenation of several mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) in series .",
    "this new opportunity of scalability , which is not topologically possible in many of the setups experimentally developed so far , exploits the interference between adjacent edge channels with the same chirality , coupled by means of some localized potential .",
    "coherent mixing among co - propagating iqh channels has been investigated in recent times mainly between spin - resolved channel ( induced by the spin - orbit interaction )  @xcite , or in connection with inelastic scattering at high chemical potential imbalance  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an intereferometer that exploits non - engineered scattering mechanisms between adiacent spin - resolved channels has been realized and successfully tested in ref .  .",
    "while the possibility of locally breaking the adiabatic transport in iqh systems has been recognized long time ago@xcite , there is now a call for a more focused study on how much adjacent cyclotron - resolved ( i.e. corresponding to different landau levels ) co - propagating edge channels might be influenced by an engineered non - adiabatic potential .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of inducing coherent mixing between two co - propagating edge channels in a hall bar due to an abrupt ( non - adiabatic ) potential steps along the direction of propagation .",
    "more precisely , we calculate the inter - channel transmission probability between two co - propagating edge states induced by the potential step , which is directly connected to the conductance of the system through the landauer - bttiker current formula ",
    "( [ eq:100 ] ) in the following .",
    "the implementation of such local , short - scale potential variations is , in principle , within the experimental reach of cutting - edge technology , for example , through : i ) precise impurity implantation by means of focused ion beam  @xcite , afm induced oxidation  @xcite , cleaved - edge overgrown technique  @xcite , and tunable scanning gate microscopy  @xcite .    for the sake of clarity here we focus on idealized configurations .",
    "we first consider the case of a single potential step where two edge channels are open on its left and right hand side , finding that the channel mixing probability is pretty small even for heights of the potential step of the order of the landau level ( ll ) separation @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , in the presence of a single edge channel on both sides of the step , we find that no reflection is allowed as long as the width of the bar is larger than a few magnetic lengths . by placing in series a number of such potential steps , though",
    ", channel mixing of the order of 50% could realistically be achieved .",
    "the situation changes when a single edge channel is open on the left hand side , while two channels are open on the right hand side of a potential step . here",
    "channel mixing can be as high as 30% for a ( single ) sharp step .",
    "finally we calculate the stationary charge density in the hall bar even in the case where the potential step in smoothed , finding indications , in all situations examined , that channel mixing persists ( within the same order of magnitude ) as long as the potential changes over a distance not exceeding few magnetic lengths .",
    "all the results presented here are obtained neglecting electron - electron interaction , which is expected to be important only when a finite chemical potential imbalance is imposed between two iqh edge states and dominate the energy exchange between them in the presence of non - equilibrium electron distributions ( see refs .   for different theoretical models ) . in the zero - bias regime , however , electron - electron interactions are not proven to play an important role , the interference pattern in mzi experiments being consistent with the single - particle theory  @xcite .",

    "a simple evaluation of the channel - mixing transmission probability can be done by assuming that , after the sharp step , the potential smoothly goes to zero ( see fig .  [",

    "the role of these additional gates is to modify the lateral confinement potential in such a way to alter the distance @xmath120 traveled by the electrons propagating between two steps . indeed , due to the large difference @xmath125 , even a small variation of @xmath120 ( of the order of 1/10 of the magnetic length ) results in a very significant variation of phase difference between the modes @xmath126 .",

    "<S> we investigate the coherent mixing of co - propagating edge channels in a quantum hall bar produced by step potentials . in the case of two edge channels </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , although a single step induces only a few percent mixing , a series of steps could yield 50% mixing . in addition , a strong mixing is found when the potential height of a single step allows a different number of edge channels on the two sides of the step . charge density probability has been also calculated even for the case where the step is smoothened . </S>"
