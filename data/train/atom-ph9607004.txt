    "the use of quantum cluster expansions was introduced in 1938 by kahn and uhlenbeck @xcite , who generalized to quantum statistical mechanics the ursell functions @xmath1 defined by this author in 1927 @xcite .",
    "the major virtue of cluster expansions is that they provide directly density expansions for systems where the interaction potential is not a necessarily small perturbation ; in fact , it may even diverge at short relative distances ( hard cores for instance ) while usual perturbations theories generate power series in the interaction potential , where each term becomes infinite for hard core potentials .",
    "starting from a quantum cluster analysis , the beth uhlenbeck formula @xcite gives an explicit expression of the first terms of a fugacity expansion ( or virial expansion ) for the grand potential of a quantum gas .",
    "the expression is valid for any potential , the latter being characterized by its phase shifts in a completely general way .",
    "one should nevertheless keep in mind that the words `` density expansion '' have a double meaning in this context .  in a dilute gas ,",
    "there are actually two dimensionless parameters which characterize `` diluteness '' : the product @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number density of the gas and @xmath4 is a length characterizing the potential range ( diameter of hard cores for instance ) , and the product @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the quantum thermal wavelength of the particles .",
    "the former parameter is small if , classically , a snapshot of the system shows particles among which almost all are moving freely , while the few that interact are engaged in binary collisions only ; the latter , purely quantum in nature , is sometimes called the quantum degeneracy parameter , and remains small provided there is little overlap of the quantum wave packets .",
    "the validity of the beth uhlenbeck formula , as all fugacity expansions , therefore requires two independent parameters to be small .    in a previous article @xcite",
    ", we discuss one method which conveniently treats the two parameters separately , and allows one to include the effects of statistics by exact summations while limiting the expansion to the lowest orders in @xmath2 .",
    "the technique is based on the use of ursell operators @xmath7 generalizing the ursell functions ( for a system of distinguishable particles ) , coupled with the exact calculation of the effect of exchange cycles @xmath8 of arbitrary length @xmath9 ; for short we call it the technique of u - c diagrams .",
    "the result is another expression of the grand potential , which is no longer a fugacity expansion since it includes a summation over all sizes of exchange cycles so that statistical effects are included to all orders .  truncating the expansion to its first terms ( lowest @xmath10 values and/or low order in a given @xmath7 ) gives results which remain valid for `` dilute degenerate systems '' @xcite , that is for all systems where the potential range is sufficiently small , but where the degeneracy of the system may become significant . in this article",
    "we will start from an expression of the grand potential which is limited to the first order correction in the second ursell operator @xmath0 , obtained in @xcite as a trace over two particles of a product of operators .",
    "we reduce the trace to an explicit integral where the effects of the interactions are contained in a simple matrix element .",
    "the range of validity of our result is actually similar to that of the calculations based on the use of pseudopotentials @xcite , another approach where the final results automatically include the summation of an infinite perturbation series in terms of the initial potential .",
    "the two methods are comparable , but we think that the u - c diagram method provides more general and more precise results , basically because it includes the short range correlations between the particles , and because all scattering channels with given angular momentum as well as their exact energy dependence are included instead of only one constant scattering length .",
    "another point of comparison is the class of methods , for instance discussed in @xcite or @xcite , where a renormalization procedure is used in order to obtain expansions in terms of the scattering @xmath11 matrix instead of the interaction potential itself @xmath12 ; in the calculations discussed in the present article , no renormalization of this kind is needed since , roughly speaking , it is already included in the @xmath7 s , which are the building blocks of our method .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , our method is no longer valid when the gaseous system is brought too close to a phase transition ( superfluid transition of single particles for bosons , of pairs for fermions ) .",
    "we begin this article with a study of the expression of the grand potential , and show how it can be expressed as an expression that is similar to the well known beth uhlenbeck formula ; actually it can be obtained from it by two simple substitutions .",
    "we then discuss the physics contained in this general result , as well as the changes introduced by the possible occurrence of bound states .",
    "in particular we consider the effects of exchange between bound and unbound particles , an effect which is not contained in the usual beth uhlenbeck formalism ; this kind of exchange may play some role in clouds of laser cooled alkali atoms @xcite for which the potential is sufficiently attractive to sustain a large number of bound states .  in section [ spin1/2 ]",
    "we apply these results to spin 1/2 particles .  finally , in section [ elements ] , we discuss the appropriate quantities in terms of which one should describe the effects of the potential on the physical properties of the system , and introduce for this purpose the so called `` ursell length '' , which plays a role similar to the scattering length @xmath13 .  in the theoretical study of quantum gases , and as already mentioned , one frequently used method is to replace the real interaction potential between the particles by a `` pseudopotential '' that has no range ( a dirac delta function of the space variables ) , and to treat this potential to first perturbation order ; in other words one ignores the distortion of the many - body wave functions at short relative distances and the associated effects of the inter particle correlations .",
    "the justification of this approach is based on the physical expectation that , for a dilute gas , all the effects of the potential should be contained in the binary collision phase shifts associated with the potential , which can easily be reproduced to first order by a pseudopotential ; meanwhile all detailed information on the behavior of the wave function at short relative distances can safely be discarded .",
    "our formalism allows one to explicitly distinguish between short range effects ( `` in potential effects '' ) and asymptotic effects ( out of the potential ) , which naturally leads to a discussion of this ansatz .",
    "the interactions appear in terms of a matrix element of an ursell operator , which depends on the potential but does not reduce to it ; for fermions at low temperatures , the matrix elements contain physical effects which are not included in usual treatments of normal fermi gases .",
    "the basic object in terms of which most physical quantities will be written in this article is the second ursell operator @xmath14 , defined by : @xmath15 } \\right ]   \\label{u2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are single particle hamiltonians , containing the kinetic energy of the particle and , if necessary , its coupling to an external potential , and where :    @xmath18    is the hamiltionan of two particles , including the mutual interaction potential @xmath19 . depending of the context , it may be more convenient to use the symmetrized operator @xmath20 : @xmath21 } { 2}=\\frac{\\left [ 1+\\eta p_{ex}\\right ] } { 2}u_{2}(1,2 )   \\label{u2sa}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the exchange operator between particles 1 and 2 and @xmath23 has the value + 1 for bosons , @xmath24 for fermions .",
    "moreover , the `` interaction representation version '' of either @xmath0 and @xmath20 , obtained by multiplying these operators by @xmath25 , will also be useful ; we denote them with an additional bar over the operator , for instance : @xmath26 this operator and its symmetrized version @xmath27 act only in the space of relative motion of the two particles ; they have no action at all on the variables of the center of mass .",
    "finally , if the particles are not submitted to an external potential ( @xmath28 contains only the kinetic energy ) , it is convenient to introduce the momentum @xmath29 of the center of mass of the two particles as well as the hamiltonian of the relative motion : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the mass of the particles ) ; then , @xmath32 can be written in the form of a product : @xmath33 _ { rel }   \\label{u2bis}\\ ] ] with :    @xmath34 _ { rel}=\\left [ \\text{e}^{-\\beta h_{rel}}-\\text{e}^{-\\beta \\frac{{\\bf p}^2}m}\\right ]   \\label{u2rel}\\ ] ]      we now start from relation ( 46 ) of @xcite which gives the grand potential ( multiplied by @xmath35 ) in the form : @xmath36 _ { ig}+\\left [ \\limfunc{log}z\\right ] _ { int }   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 _ { ig}$ ] is the well known value of @xmath38 for the ideal gas : @xmath39 _ { ig } & = -\\eta \\text{tr}\\left\\ { \\limfunc{log}\\left [ 1-\\eta z\\text{e}^{-\\beta h_{1}}\\right ] \\right\\ } \\\\   & = \\eta \\text{tr}\\left\\ { \\limfunc{log}\\left [ 1+\\eta f\\right ] \\right\\ } \\end{array } \\label{1prime}\\ ] ] and where the correction introduced by the interactions is : @xmath40 _ { int}=z^{2}\\,\\text{tr}_{1,2}\\left\\ { u_{2}^{s , a}(1,2)\\,\\left [ 1+\\eta f(1)\\right ] \\,\\left [ 1+\\eta f(2)\\right ] \\right\\ }   \\label{1bis}\\ ] ] in these equations , @xmath41 is the fugacity , @xmath42 the inverse temperature and @xmath43 the chemical potential , while @xmath44 is defined as the operator : @xmath45 similar results can be found in the work of lee and yang , see formulas ( ii.8 ) and ( ii.23 ) of ref . @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , equation ( [ 1bis ] )",

    "an obvious difference between @xmath146 and @xmath145 is that the former depends on one more characteristic length than the potential , namely the thermal wavelength @xmath6 , so that one can expect that its range will depend explicitly on the temperature .",
    "it is sometimes argued that a description of the interactions in terms of the scattering length is sufficient at very low temperatures , because the range of the potential @xmath145 remains always much smaller than the de broglie wavelengths of the particles .",
    "as far as the matrix elements of @xmath146 are concerned , this is of course true if the interaction potential is treated to first order only but , precisely at very low temperatures , the higher order terms become significant and @xmath146 may acquire a range that exceeds by far that of the potential itself .",

    "we now discuss the limit of validity of the results obtained in the preceding section or , since they are equivalent , of equations ( [ logz - int ] ) and ( [ z - spins ] ) .",

    "the reason is that , when a system of bosons approaches the region of quantum condensation , the distribution function @xmath44 starts to build up a singularity at low energies .",

    ", since they contain larger and larger number of functions @xmath44 ( or of factors @xmath151",
    ".  in other words , terms which normally remain small corrections become dominant when the point of bose einstein condensation is approached ; see the discussion already given in @xcite , where it is emphasized should be positive ( dominant character of the attractive interactions in the matrix element ) . ]",
    "that a theory limited to first order in @xmath146 would predict the disappearance of the bose einstein condensation phenomenon and its replacement by a simple crossover between two regimes .    for fermions ,",
    "the discussion is different since no special phenomenon takes place when @xmath48 reaches one ; when the gas is cooled at constant density , this merely corresponds to a cross over region where the gas is becoming degenerate .",
    "when the temperature is decreased even more , a stronger degeneracy builds up while @xmath152e@xmath153 becomes larger and larger ( @xmath122 increases while @xmath43 remains almost constant if the density is fixed ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that @xmath48 itself can not be an expansion parameter in this region ; but our perturbation series is not a @xmath48 expansion and it may still converge for degenerate systems , provided the matrix elements of @xmath146 are sufficiently small . in the next section , we will see that these matrix elements are equal to the product @xmath154 , where @xmath6 is the thermal wave length and @xmath155 is some microscopic length ( the ursell length ) that we will define more precisely later .",
    "let us for instance discuss ( [ n2 ] ) where the interaction corrections involve a double integral over two momenta .",
    "the first introduces the number density @xmath3 ; the second contains a function @xmath156 , which in the limit of low temperatures is non zero only in an energy slice of width @xmath157 at the surface of the fermi sphere ; the corresponding width @xmath158 in terms of momentum is given by : @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 is the momentum at the fermi surface ) so that the result of these integrations is : @xmath161 the small parameter of the expansion plays an essential role in this argument .",
    "this factor occurs in all expressions , for instance , in ( [ m ] ) , the bracket @xmath162 $ ] may be written as @xmath163 $ ] .",
    "if we had ignored this factor , we would have found @xmath164 as the expansion parameter , which is a temperature dependent factor ( as in the usual beth uhlenbeck formula ) . ]",
    "is therefore the product @xmath165 , which is not very different from @xmath166 for degenerate gases , and indeed remains small if the average distance between the particles is much larger than @xmath155 .",
    "this result is not surprising : indeed , in the usual theory of dilute non ideal fermi gases @xcite , the expansion parameter is independent of the temperature , which plays no particular role as long as the system is strongly degenerate .",
    "one might be tempted at this point to conclude that the generalized beth uhlenbeck formula is valid for arbitrary degeneracy of a fermionic system ; nevertheless , in the next section , we will see that the factor @xmath155 itself may become very large at very low temperatures , which in turn increases the expansion parameter and , automatically , limits the validity of the expansion at some point .",
    "we will assume that this somewhat unexpected phenomenon is a precursor of bcs  pair condensation ;",
    "if this is the case , the low temperature limit of the validity of the generalized beth uhlenbeck is that the gas should remain a normal fermi gas and , even , not to be too close to condensation . in general , for bosons as well as for fermions , we can therefore conclude that our calculations remain valid as long as bose einstein or bcs condensation is not too close .    .",
    "we now study in more detail the values of the basic ingredient that we use to describe the effects of the interactions on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum gas , namely the diagonal matrix element of @xmath46  together with those of the un - symmetrized operator if the particles have spins , see section [ spin1/2 ] .",
    "a natural question then is the following : to determine these coefficients , is it sufficient to characterize the potential in terms of its binary collision phase shifts , which determine the asymptotic behavior of interacting wave functions , or is it also necessary to include some information on the behavior of the wave functions at short relative distances , inside the potential ?  for bosons at very low temperatures ,",
    "is it possible , even more simply , to reason in terms of the scattering length only ?",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction that , in the literature on low temperature dilute systems , it is often considered as physically obvious that the short range properties of the potential play no role in the thermodynamics ; it is then possible to replace the real potential by an effective potential ( or pseudopotential ) which has the expression already given in ( [ veff ] ) in terms of the scattering length @xmath13 . with a potential having zero range , it becomes of course meaningless to take into account the distortions of the wave functions inside the potential , in other words the contribution of particles `` in the middle of a collision '' .  but with real potentials , it is not obvious that these contributions are non existent , in particular since statistical effects arising from particle exchange are expected to be more important when the particles are close .",
    "we discuss here this question in the context of the generalized beth uhlenbeck formula that we have obtained , with the help of simple examples such as a step like potential mimicking a real interaction potential , or even hard spheres .",
    "we first discuss the ursell length @xmath113 , which we have already introduced above , and which depends on the temperature while @xmath13 does not .",
    "if the interaction potential @xmath145 were sufficiently weak , we could use a first order perturbation expression of the ursell operator : @xmath168 which would lead to the following expression : @xmath169 inserting ( [ veff ] ) into this result provides : @xmath170 where @xmath50 is the macroscopic volume and @xmath171 the thermal wavelength ( [ lambda ] ) .    by analogy with this first order calculation , it is convenient to characterize the diagonal matrix elements in terms of a length , @xmath113 , which we call the ursell length and which we have defined in ( [ sigma ] ) as : @xmath172 this very definition ensures that , within the theory of the pseudopotential , @xmath113 is exactly equal to the scattering length @xmath13 .",
    "this length therefore provides a convenient tool for a discussion of the validity of this approximation : as long as @xmath113 remains very close to @xmath13 for all relevant values of @xmath95 , the theory of pseudopotentials and ours provide strictly equivalent results . for identical particles , what is needed is the symmetrized ursell length , already defined in ( [ sigmaprime ] ) and ( [ sigmaprim ] ) , which allows us to write the correction to the grand potential for spinless particles in the form ( [ eq - base ] ) .",
    "this equation ( [ eq - base ] ) expresses that the symmetrized ursell length gives , within the numerical factor in front of this integral , the crossed contribution of two velocity classes @xmath173 and @xmath174 to the grand potential of the system ( its pressure ) .",
    "if the particles have spins , we have to use ( [ z - spins ] ) and ( [ sigma - spins ] ) .    in section [ rotation ] , we introduced spherical orbital variables from the free spherical waves @xmath175 .  at this stage , it is convenient to use spherical waves that are normalized in a sphere of volume @xmath176 .",
    "we therefore introduce a new notation , @xmath177 , but these kets are simply proportional to the @xmath178 : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a normalization coefficient which in the limit of large values of the product @xmath181 is equal to : @xmath182 introducing in the same way the normalized kets @xmath183 in the presence of the interaction potential , we can write : @xmath184 ^{-2}\\left [ \\sum_{k^{^{\\prime } } } \\left| < \\varphi _ { k , l , m}^{(0)}\\mid \\varphi _ { k^{^{\\prime } } , l , m}>\\right| ^{2}e^{-\\beta \\left [ e(k^{^{\\prime } } ) -e(k)\\right ] } -1\\right ]   \\label{toto}\\ ] ] where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the energies of the free and interacting states .    in what follows we discuss the values of the ursell length and its @xmath95 dependence with the help of a few examples .      in order to simplify our discussion , we now consider an interaction potential made of a hard core of diameter @xmath187 ( with @xmath188 ) and of an attractive part ( @xmath189 ) from relative distance @xmath190 to @xmath191 ; see figure 1 .",
    "our discussion is in fact more general , but this kind of simplified potential is a convenient way to mimic the effects of a more realistic interaction potential , containing strong repulsion at short distances and van der waals attraction at large distances .",
    "for instance , it is not difficult to find a relation between @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath4 which ensures that the scattering length of this potential vanishes ( compensation of the effects of attraction and repulsion at low energies ) .",
    "does this imply that the matrix elements of @xmath0 , that is the ursell length @xmath113 , also vanish ?",
    "not in general , since the scalar products @xmath194 in ( [ toto ] ) are not only sensitive to the changes of the interacting wave functions outside of the potential ( which do not occur if the scattering length vanishes ) but also to their values inside the potential .  in other words , for a degenerate dilute gas , all the effects of the potential are not necessarily contained in the scattering phase shifts .",
    "we nevertheless note that , when the range @xmath4 of the potential tends to zero , the corrections to the scalar products are necessarily of third order in @xmath4 ( at least ) , while first order terms occur in the phase shifts ( for instance , at very low temperatures , the beth uhlenbeck formula predicts a correction which is proportional to @xmath195 ) .",
    "therefore , if the potential range is sufficiently small ( compared to the two other microscopic distances , the average distance between particles @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) , one may limit the calculation to first order in @xmath4 so that the contribution of the distortion of the wave functions inside the potential may be ignored .  within this approximation ,",
    "all effects of the potential on the thermodynamic properties are indeed contained in the collision phase shifts . a brief similar discussion in terms of `` shape dependent terms '' ( as opposed to phase shift dependent terms ) appears in the two last paragraphs of section 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite    consequently , in all calculations of the thermodynamic quantities which are limited to first order in the potential range , it is sufficient to characterize the potential by its long distance effects on the wave function ( phase shifts ) only , while short range effects are irrelevant ; if all collisions take place at very low energies , all effects are then contained in the scattering length only . on the other hand",
    ", this is not necessarily the case if higher order terms in the potential range are included , and corrections which originate `` inside the potential '' , corresponding to the contribution of particles `` in the middle of a collision '' , may appear ; see also @xcite .",
    "actually , the question remains open as to whether is would be possible , by some mathematical transformation , to express these `` in potential effects '' in terms of the phase shifts only ; this is for instance possible in the absence of the phase occupation factors , since one then gets the usual beth uhlenbeck formula for which such a transformation is known .  in the presence of these factors",
    ", we have made efforts to investigate the possibility that a similar simplification takes place , but we have not been able to prove it .",
    "a possible conjecture is that short range and long range effects are in general independent from each other , but this remains to be proved by a precise example .      for hard spheres",
    ", the interacting wave function does not penetrate into the potential ; this is a special case where all physical effects of the potential are necessarily contained in the collision phase shifts .",
    "the potential range @xmath4 coincides in this case with the scattering length @xmath13.but this is not sufficient to ensure that the theory of pseudopotentials should be equivalent to our results , and we now discuss this question .      in order to obtain the correction to the thermodynamic potential for hard spheres ,",

    "but there is no difficulty in treating the general case , since the calculation of @xmath52 is very similar ; moreover , as soon as the wave number @xmath57 is sufficiently small , one simply has @xmath228 and @xmath229 .  the results concerning @xmath113 are shown in figures 2 and 3 ( more details about the calculations can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "there are two parameters in the problem , @xmath13 and @xmath6 . as convenient dimensionless variables we choose , either the product @xmath230 , or @xmath231 ;",
    "the ratio @xmath232 is then kept as a fixed parameter , which has small values either when the potential range is very small or when the temperature is low .",
    "figure 2 shows that , when @xmath233 , and as long as @xmath230 remains smaller than 1 , the ursell length is indeed equal to @xmath13 ( with a good accuracy ) , so that the theory of the pseudopotential is fully justified . for higher temperatures",
    ", we note that the low energy values of @xmath113 become noticeably different from @xmath13 .",
    "this is not surprising since , when @xmath11 increases , we progressively reach a classical regime of small wave packets ; they no longer have a much larger spatial extent than the potential , while this is necessary for the approximation of the pseudopotential to apply .",
    "we therefore concentrate on low values of the ratio @xmath232 .    if the system is made of bosons , since the distributions @xmath44 s contained in ( [ eq - base ] ) have at most the same width as gaussian thermal exponentials , the values of @xmath230 that are relevant in the integral are comparable to 1 , or smaller ; figure 2 then shows that the use of our theory or of the theory of pseudopotentials leads to the same results ; see the discussion of section [ rotation ] , in particular formula ( [ variation ] ) . but assume now that the system is made of fermions , and that the temperature is progressively lowered at constant density .",
    "if the system is degenerate , the width of the functions @xmath234 s is determined by the fermi momentum @xmath235 , which in turn depends on the density ; in other words the width is practically independent of the temperature .  meanwhile , if the temperature is lowered more and more , @xmath6 increases so that the product @xmath230 can take arbitrarily large values inside the integral .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath231 remains limited to values smaller than 1 since , for degenerate gases where the distance between the particles is comparable to the inverse fermi momentum in a degenerate gas , the diluteness condition @xmath236 yields : @xmath237 the departure from 1 of the curves of figure 2 , which fall well below this value when @xmath230 increases , shows that significant discrepancies from a pseudopotential theory may indeed be obtained .",
    "this is even more visible in figure 3 , which uses a different variable , the product @xmath231 : even for small values of the ratio @xmath232 , significant departures of the ursell length from @xmath13 are obtained for small values of @xmath231 ; in other words , ( [ corrferm ] ) is no longer a good approximation of the generalized beth uhlenbeck formula .",
    "actually , the smaller @xmath232 , the more pronounced these departures are ; we have an illustration of the consequences of the temperature dependence of @xmath146 , where the effects of the potential are more and more delocalized by thermal effects while @xmath6 increases ; consequently , variations of the matrix element occur even if the range of the potential is very small and even if @xmath207 .  in figure 4",
    ", we plot the variations of the diagonal element @xmath238 _ { rel}\\mid { \\bf r}>$ ] as a function of the relative position @xmath67 ; the results show clearly how the second ursell operator acquires a longer and longer range at decreasing temperatures .",
    "a striking feature of figure 3 is the change of sign of the ursell length which takes place when @xmath231 increases from zero .",
    "the origin of this change is understandable from ( [ toto ] ) , from which one can convince oneself that the contribution of low values of @xmath218 becomes dominant as soon as @xmath57 is sufficiently large ; this is because , while the scalar product @xmath239 with @xmath240 decreases relatively slowly when @xmath57 increases ( as @xmath241 ) , the exponential @xmath242 varies much more rapidly and so that it makes small values of @xmath243 dominate the sum .  in other words ,",
    "what determines the diagonal matrix element of @xmath0 is the contribution of interacting states that have a very small relative energy ; because these states evolve more slowly in time than the free wave packets of energy @xmath244 , the net differential result is equivalent to an attraction .",
    "we therefore come to the conclusion that even hard cores can result in an effective attraction between fermions of opposite spins at the surface of a fermi sphere , provided that the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "but other interesting features also appear ; for instance there is a strong dependence of the matrix element on the relative momentum and , for some value of @xmath57 , the ursell length ( the effective interaction ) vanishes ; probably more important is the fact that the effective interaction increases almost exponentially as a function of @xmath245 , which is nothing but the square of the relative momentum of the interacting particles .",
    "this shows that the correction to the partition function is dominated by processes that take place preferably between particles having almost opposite momenta on the surface of the fermi sphere ( assuming that they have opposite spins ) .",
    "we now come back to the discussion made at the end of section [ physdisc ] concerning the validity of the ursell expansion for a dilute gas of fermions .",
    "the result of this discussion was that the expansion parameter is the product @xmath166 .",
    "this parameter would remain a constant as a function of temperature for a gas of constant density if the ursell length did not vary too much as a function of temperature , so that the situation would be simple .",
    "but in fact , we have actually found for fermi gases that the maximum value of @xmath155 becomes larger and larger at low temperatures.this automatically limits the range of validity of the first order @xmath0 theory to temperatures at which the relevant values of the ursell length are not too large .    to determine a limit temperature",
    ", we will look for an asymptotic expression of the ursell length valid for wave vectors of the magnitude of the fermi wave vector @xmath246 . in this case , the terms corresponding to low values of @xmath247 in the sum over the states of interacting pairs of ( [ toto ] ) are dominant .",
    "when @xmath248 the square of the scalar product ( [ hsscprod ] ) reduces to : @xmath249 we replace the square of the scalar product in ( [ toto ] ) by this expression and transform the sum into an integral : @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the fermi energy ( proportional to @xmath252 for a strongly degenerate gas ) .",
    "we are interested in the limit @xmath253or @xmath254 ; we can thus replace the sine by its first order approximation , which yields : @xmath255 the validity criterion of the ursell expansion then becomes : @xmath256 which shows that the theory is valid only when the temperature satisfies the approximate condition : @xmath257 }   \\label{validity}\\ ] ] inside the logarithmic function in the denominator , both the factor @xmath258 and @xmath259 are larger than one , especially the latter for a very dilute gas ; but since the logarithm has slow variations , whatever parameters we choose , in practice the limit temperature fixed by this condition is not lower than is about a tenth of fermi temperature , a rather a high temperature compared to the transition temperature for cooper pairing .",
    "our conclusion is that , for any type of interaction , and even if the density of the gas is fixed at a very low value , at sufficiently low temperature the ursell length becomes larger and larger so that the ursell expansion is no longer a good expansion .",
    "the maximum value of the ursell length is obtained for pairs of fermions with opposite spins and maximum relative momenta , which corresponds to two fermions having opposite momenta on the surface of the fermi sphere ; this is reminiscent of the bcs pairing phenomenon , while the phenomenon takes place at much higher temperatures ( the right hand side of ( [ validity ] ) does not coincide with the standard expression of the critical temperature ) so that stricto sensu it can not be called a precursor of this transition . whether of not it is related to this transition , the change of sign of the ursell length will have a strong effect on the two body correlation function in the system ( we have seen in @xcite that the second ursell operator is closely related to the short range properties of the two body density operator ) .",
    "these results are also reminiscent of the well known work of luttinger and kohn @xcite who predict the occurrence of superconductivity in purely repulsive systems , as well of the more recent work of kagan and chubukov @xcite who also predict in this case @xmath260 wave superfluidity in a dilute fermi gas .",
    "we are planning to investigate this connection in more detail in a future article .    to summarize , for both fermionic of bosonic systems , the validity of the ursell expansion is limited , even for a very dilute gas , to temperatures sufficiently above any transition point .",
    "mathematically , in the case of bosons the divergence of the series arises from the distribution function ( or operator ) @xmath44 , while in the case of fermions its origin is the increasing value of the matrix elements of @xmath0 themselves .",
    "our formalism provides a systematic treatment of the interactions in a dilute gas where the basic objects are not the matrix elements of the potential itself but those of temperature dependent operators . in @xcite , we have shown how microscopic , short range correlations between particles could explicitly be taken into account and calculated . in the present article , we investigate the macroscopic properties of the gas by basing the discussion on expression ( [ logz - int ] ) , which resembles a first order perturbative expression of an energy correction , while it actually is rather different .",
    "this is mostly because the matrix element which appears in the expression is not the matrix element of the potential itself , or of some variety of pseudopotential , but the matrix element of the second ursell operator @xmath0 , which corresponds physically to a local boltzmannian equilibrium .  except of course in trivial cases where the interaction potential is indeed weak for all values of the relative distances of the particles , which allows for a first order treatment of the potential ,",
    "this introduces significant differences ; the major reason is the temperature dependence of the matrix elements of @xmath0 , which is in general more complex than being merely proportional to @xmath122 ( as would be the case in usual perturbation theory ) .",
    "this matrix element is conveniently described in terms of the ursell length .",
    "we have seen in particular that , for fermions at very low temperatures , effective attractions at the surface of a fermi sphere may take place , independently of the repulsive or attractive character of the potential itself .",
    "moreover , our formalism contains naturally effects such as the statistical exchange between bound molecules and free particles , which may play some role in experiments with alkali atoms at very low temperatures @xcite .      many useful and friendly discussions with roger balian took place on the subject of this article .",

    "after completion of this manuscript , we received a preprint from h.  stein et al.@xcite who , in the case of bosons , find that the many body scattering length undergoes a divergence when the superfluid transition is approached , an effect similar to what we obtain for fermions .",
    "the significance of this similarity has not been examined in detail yet .",
    "figure 1 : steplike potential used to discuss compensation effects between the attractive and the repulsive part on the scattering length ; @xmath192 is the depth of the attractive potential , @xmath4 its range ; a hard core of range @xmath187 is assumed ( @xmath261 ) . while a relation between these three parameters can be found to make the scattering length @xmath13 vanish , the effect of the potential on the wave function inside its range remains significant .",
