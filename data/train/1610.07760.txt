    "the rosensweig instability - a surface instability of a ferrofluid - has been of interest since the 1960s ( see cowley & rosensweig  @xcite and rosensweig @xcite ) . in an experiment , a vertical magnetic field is applied to a static ferrofluid layer , and regular cellular patterns ( typically hexagons ) emerge on the fluid surface as the field strength is increased through a critical value ( see gollwitzer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for recent experimental results ) .",
    "recently , experiments have shown that spatially localised free - surface structures occur in the hysteresis region between the flat state and the cellular spatially periodic patterns ( see richter  @xcite , richter & barashenkov  @xcite and lloyd _ et al . _",

    "little is known theoretically on the existence of localised solutions to the ferrohydrostatic equations . +      the first attempt at a theoretical explanation for the nucleation of static cellular patterns was by gailitis  @xcite .",
    "gailitis postulated a free energy for the system ( a ferrofluid of infinite depth with a linear magnetisation law ) into which he substituted an _",
    "ansatz _ for a cellular free surface .",
    "the resulting equations for the unknown coefficients were then solved to find regions of existence for the various cellular patterns ( stripes , squares and hexagons ) .",
    "this work was extended by friedrichs & engel  @xcite to finite - depth ferrofluids .",
    "zaitsev & shliomis  @xcite considered one - dimensional static spatially periodic solutions to the ferrohydrostatic equations near onset of the rosensweig instability , again assuming a linear magnetisation law and infinite fluid depth .",
    "these results were subsequently extended by twombly & thomas  @xcite to two - dimensional spatially periodic free - surface solutions and finite - depth fluids .",
    "these local bifurcation theories were complemented by a formal normal - form analysis by silber & knobloch  @xcite ( for two - dimensional patterns and infinite depth ) , and there have recently been attempts at deriving time - dependent amplitude equations for spatially periodic free - surface patterns near onset ( see bohlius _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all current theoretical studies , whether rigorous or heuristic , assume a linear relationship between the magnetisation @xmath0 of the ferrofluid and the strength of the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the linearity of the magnetisation law @xmath2 allows one to replace a nonlinear equation for the magnetic potential in the fluid by laplace s equation and greatly simplifies computations of coefficients in bifurcation and normal - form theory .",
    "however , experiments show that realistic magnetisation laws are nonlinear ( e.g.  see lloyd _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this point ) , emphasising the need to develop a theoretical framework which includes general nonlinear magnetisation laws .",

    "one - dimensional spatially localised solutions to that problem ( ` gravity - capillary solitary waves ' ) with water of finite depth have been studied intensively in the last twenty - five years using a technique known as the _ kirchgssner reduction _ ( see iooss @xcite , groves & wahln @xcite and the references therein ) . in this approach one",
