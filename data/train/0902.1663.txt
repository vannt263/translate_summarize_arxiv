    "anonymity networks have evolved to address the problem of anonymous communication among users .",
    "as internet technology becomes more prevelant in everyday life , questions of privacy and monitoring become more important .",
    "the anonymous network provides a means of communicating confidentially .",
    "however , it is still vulnerable to attack .",
    "one of the means of this is by attempting to match messages sent with messages received .",
    "an exhaustive brute force attack is inefficient ; statistical attacks are reasonably fast and reasonably effective .",
    "further , there is a need for a metric to measure the amount of anonymity that can be expected from a system .",
    "a mix network , invented by chaum @xcite , is a mechanism for anonymizing the correlation between senders and receivers of messages .",
    "messages are sent into the mix where they are gathered , permuted and then delivered .",
    "there are several mechanisms for doing this , including a threshold mix which takes in messages and holds them in a buffer until a predetermined threshold number of messages is reached and then it sends them .",
    "the only possible attacks are based on observation of the input / output behaviour of the mix .",
    "we assume that it is possible for an adversary to see how many messages a user has sent and how many a user has received .",
    "the main challenge for breaking anonymity in mix networks is determining whether some user alice is communicating with some user bob .",
    "a secondary consideration can be the trajectory of a particular message , either who sent it or who received it . again focusing on alice and bob",
    ", we can either determine a _",
    "metric _ which indicates the likelihood of correlating messages sent by alice with messages received by bob , or we can actually generate an _ attack _ which will attempt to break the system and reveal whom alice is talking to ( or who is talking to bob ) .",
    "metrics allow the user to make an informed choice of anonymity network .",
    "they also allow an evaluation of how good an anonymity model is .",
    "historically , metrics have often considered either the perspective of an individual user or of an individual message . a recent paper of edman _",
    "_ expands the view to a system wide approach , but focuses on the traffic of individual messages .",
    "here we extend the approach to consider the traffic of sets of messages ( in particular , messages sent by the same user , alice , or received by the same user , bob ) .",
    "section [ ourmetric ] introduces our metric , reviews existing metrics and explores the differences ours manifests .",
    "sections [ details ] and [ extract ] show how to calculate the metric .",
    "section [ data ] is a presentation and analysis of the data .",
    "section [ final ] explores future work and delivers a conclusion .",
    "to establish our notation , suppose there are @xmath0 senders and @xmath1 receivers , the @xmath2 sender sends @xmath3 messages in a round and the @xmath4 receiver receives @xmath5 messages in a round , and that the total number of messages sent in a round is @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7",
    ". then we want to know how many ways the @xmath6 messages could be divided up in this way .",
    "these problems are often modeled , particularly in statistics literature , in terms of balls and urns . in this language",
    "we want to know how many ways there are to deposit @xmath6 balls in @xmath1 urns , where there are @xmath0 different colours of balls : @xmath8 of one colour , @xmath9 of a second colour , etc . , and each urn is to hold a particular number of balls : the first urn holds @xmath10 balls , the second urn holds @xmath11 balls , etc .    for example , suppose there are three messages , each labeled by @xmath12 , sent by @xmath13 , three messages , each labeled by @xmath14 , sent by @xmath15 , and two messages , each labeled by @xmath16 , sent by @xmath17 .",
    "suppose @xmath18 receives five messages and @xmath19 receives three messages .",
    "then by direct exhaustive , brute force enumeration of all the possibilities , there are nine different ways this could happen , where the first bracketing is the messages received by @xmath18 and the second bracketing is the messages received by @xmath19 : @xmath20 ; @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 @xmath28 .    in this type of system , the attacker can gain information by careful observation of the volume of messages originating or terminating at a user .",
    "consider at one extreme when @xmath6 messages are sent by alice and @xmath6 messages are received by bob and no messages are sent or received by any other users . then we know with certainty that the messages sent by alice all went to bob . at the other extreme we have @xmath6 different senders",
    "each sending one message and @xmath6 different receivers each receiving one message . in this case",
    "the number of possibilities for sender - receiver pairs is @xmath29 .",
    "but even at intermediate stages , when some messages are sent by alice and some messages are sent by others , and some messages are received by bob and some messages are received by others , we can count the number of ways this could happen . counting this",
    "partitioning is actually a very old problem @xcite and can be solved in terms of a variety of generating functions called symmetric functions , as we will discuss in sections [ details ] and [ extract ] .",
    "our metric expresses the _ degree of anonymity _ as a ratio with the denominator representing the system with the most anonymity . in this metric",
    "the most anonymity is provided by a system in which @xmath6 messages are sent but each sender sends exactly one message and each receiver receives exactly one message , as discussed above . in this case there are @xmath29 possibilities to match up a sender message with a receiver message",
    ". we can informally define our metric as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the number of ways for @xmath0 senders and @xmath1 receivers to exchange @xmath6 messages if sender @xmath32 sends @xmath3 messages and receiver @xmath33 receives @xmath5 messages .",
    "we use the @xmath34 here to have a compression of the scale for better representation , and to avoid having numbers that are too large . in section [ details ] we will describe in detail how to calculate @xmath31 .    this metric is simple and straightforward to understand and calculate .",
    "it is a system wide metric that measures the anonymity afforded by the system as a whole , rather than the anonymity afforded to a single user .",
    "we now review existing metrics .",
    "note that various perspectives are possible , e.g. , the anonymity of an individual user , the anonymity of an individual message , or the anonymity of the system as a whole .",
    "the anonymity metric seeks to distill into a single number the strength of the network with respect to protecting its users anonymity .",
    "this number is referred to as the degree of anonymity and was first proposed by reiter and rubin @xcite .",
    "their degree of anonymity requires a probability @xmath35 assigned to each potential sender and is defined as @xmath36 for each user . a more systematic approach due to berthold _",
    "@xcite gives the degree of anonymity for a system of @xmath37 users as @xmath38 .",
    "these metrics require estimates of properties of the system and can be imprecise .",
    "the next step in metric evolution is the information theoretic ( or entropy based ) metrics .",
    "serjantov and danezis @xcite define a metric @xmath39 where @xmath6 is the number of users , and @xmath40 is the probability that a user @xmath41 was the sender or the receiver in a message exchange .",
    "this metric is called the _ effective anonymity set size _ and it measures the entropy of the system . recall that information entropy , as defined by shannon , reflects the average information gained over a sequence of symbols , each having some probability . in this case , we have the probability that a specific user @xmath41 has sent a message . in the best case",
    ", this value will be equal to @xmath42 , and grows with @xmath6 . in the worst case",
    " a user never sends , or is the only one to send  it will be 0 .    an improvement on this approach is the normalized metric of diaz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , called the degree of anonymity , which is defined as @xmath43 where the term @xmath44 is the maximum entropy of the system which is @xmath45 .",
    "this division normalizes the result of serjantov and danezis , restricting the range to @xmath46 $ ] independent of @xmath6 .",
    "there are drawbacks to these formulas . in this last case",
    ", it can be argued that , because of the normalization , it becomes easier to compare results but , at the same time , the number of users appears to become irrelevant .",
    "it also does not consider the users who have sent messages vs. the set of possible users : these metrics reflect a snapshot of the use of the system .",
    "such a snapshot is also necessary to evaluate the probabilities required to compute the formula , but it is difficult to determine the degree of confidence we can have in such estimates , i.e. their quality .",
    "a different approach is the combinatorial metric of edman _",
    "they first define a bipartite graph , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the set of sent messages and @xmath49 is the set of received messages .",
    "there is an edge between two messages @xmath3 and @xmath50 if the sent message @xmath3 could be the same as the received message @xmath50 .",
    "then this graph has an adjacency matrix , @xmath51 , where the rows are indexed by the sent messages @xmath48 and the columns are indexed by the received messages @xmath49 .",
    "a perfect matching in a graph is a subset of edges such that every vertex is adjacent to exactly one edge in the subset . in a bipartite graph",
    "this amounts to a pairing off of each vertex in set @xmath48 with exactly one vertex in set @xmath49 .    in a bipartite graph",
    "it is well - known how to count the number of perfect matchings in the graph : they are counted by a mathematical function , the permanent , defined @xmath52 where the sum is over all permutations , @xmath53 , of @xmath6 and @xmath51 is the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph .",
    "the reason the permanent works is as follows : every permutation selects an entry from each row and each column , so every pair consisting of a vertex in @xmath48 and a vertex in @xmath49 is represented exactly once .",
    "if any of the selected entries is zero ( i.e. there is no edge between those two vertices ) then the product is zero and there is no perfect matching associated with that permutation .",
    "conversely , if all entries are one then this permutation describes a perfect matching .",
    "edman _ et al .",
    "_ define a combinatorial degree of anonymity as follows : @xmath54 as with the degree of anonymity of diaz _ et al . _ the measure reflects a ratio of the actual measurement over the ideal case .",
    "the denominator is a reflection of the fact that the system providing the most anonymity is the one in which each sent message is potentially connected to each received message , i.e. the complete bipartite graph .",
    "then the @xmath55 adjacency matrix is the all 1 s matrix and the number of perfect matchings is equal to @xmath29 , the number of permutations of @xmath6 .",
    "edman _ et al .",
    "_ then generalize their definition to matrices with entries which are probabilities ( doubly stochastic matrices ) .",
    "in this model the probability in position @xmath56 is the probability that the edge between @xmath3 and @xmath50 is in a perfect matching . here , as in the unweighted case , they take a product of entries . there are a number of concerns with this approach",
    ", some of which our approach corrects .    while the permanent counts perfect matchings in the unweighted case , it is not clear which statistic is counted in the weighted case , since it is merely the sum of products of terms in the adjacency matrix . in the case of a 01 matrix the permanent terms are the products of zeros and ones",
    "but the reason there is one term for each perfect matching is that this procedure is essentially a logical and .",
    "that is , a single zero will make the product of the entire set zero . so while the entries are technically multiplied , they could just as easily be anded to the same effect . in generalizing to the non 0 - 1 case",
    "it is not clear why multiplication should be the operation of choice to combine elements , nor what it counts .",
    "furthermore , this approach requires the calculation of probabilities for each edge and this in itself can be problematic .",
    "are these probabilities estimated ? ( with all the inherent issues of inaccuracy ) . are they calculated , say using an approach such as statistical disclosure ?",
    "if so , what is the complexity of this approach and what are the quality of results it provides ?",
    "moreover , the perfect matching approach of edman _",
    "considers a sent message , @xmath3 , being matched to a received message and counts @xmath3 being matched to received message @xmath57 as different from @xmath3 being matched to @xmath58 , even if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are received by the same user .",
    "certainly they are different messages , but if the goal is to determine who is communicating with whom , the important part is to determine that one of the many messages alice sent is one of the many messages bob received .    the recent work of gierlichs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite refines the metric of edman _",
    "_ to account for many messages sent and received by each user . to account for this gierlichs _ et al .",
    "_ look at the equivalence class of perfect matchings .",
    "this is actually the same situation as what we have already discussed .",
    "for example , if user @xmath13 sends @xmath59 messages and user @xmath15 sends @xmath60 messages , while user @xmath18 receives @xmath59 messages , user @xmath19 receives @xmath59 messages , and user @xmath61 receives one message , and each @xmath62 user could potentially communicate with each @xmath63 user , then there are @xmath64 perfect matchings possible to pair up the messages sent with the messages received .    the authors denote the perfect matching by @xmath65 and each equivalence class by @xmath66 $ ] and cardinality @xmath67|=c_p$ ] .",
    "the total number of equivalence classes is some value @xmath68 ( determined by the problem ) . in the example , then , there are @xmath69 equivalence classes with cardinalities @xmath70 .",

    "the authors define the system s anonymity level , @xmath79 , as @xmath80)\\cdot \\log(pr(m_c\\in[m_{p}]))}{\\log(n!)}\\ ] ] if @xmath81 , and as @xmath82 if @xmath83 , where @xmath84)= \\frac{c_p}{per(a)}$ ] .",
    "it is worth noting that franz _",
    "@xcite also take a counting approach , although they do not do the full generality of sender / receiver patterns .",
    "in one instance they look at all possible combinations of senders for a given set of messages . in another instance",
    "they count senders sending various combinations of messages but do not consider receivers receiving several messages .",
    "while some ideas are similar to ours and could be expanded further using enumerative techniques , they do not have the full generality of our approach .",
    "in fact , classical enumerative methods used by franz _",
    "_ and gierlichs _ et al . _",
    "indeed work to count when either the senders or the receivers are fixed at sending or receiving one message each ; to do the full generality of both receivers and senders together dealing in multiple messages one needs symmetric functions , as discussed below .",
    "like gierlichs _ et al .",
    "_ we suppose that senders and receivers send many messages , we have a combinatorial metric like edman _ et al . _ and ask  how many ways for these senders to send to these receivers ? \" .",
    "this differs from gierlichs _ et al .",
    "_ who use an entropy based metric , asking instead ,  what s the probability that this perfect matching is right one ? \"",
    "their approach requires the calculation of two parameters : equivalence classes and cardinality ( see appendix [ appendixb ] for a discussion of a way of calculating cardinality ) .",
    "to do this they provide a divide - and - conquer algorithm that they note becomes rather expensive for large @xmath6 .",
    "indeed in their conclusions they suggest that a more efficient algorithm remains an open problem .",
    "our method essentially calculates the size of the equivalence classes ; however , it does so without explicitly enumerating them , thus the approach is extremely fast and streamlined .",
    "it provides a rapid but accurate measure of the anonymity of the system . as we discuss in section [ data ] , numerous trends can be discerned and this provides an interesting focus for future work .",
    "we now turn our attention to determining @xmath31 as defined in section [ ourmetric ] .",
    "the calculation of it is straightforward ; however , it requires some `` heavy machinery '' from combinatorial enumeration , namely generating functions and symmetric functions ( which are a special type of generating function ) .",
    "we briefly review generating functions before discussing the appropriate one for this particular problem .",
    "excellent introductions to generating functions can be found in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a generating function is a sum of powers of @xmath85 where the coefficient of @xmath86 counts how many items of size @xmath32 there are . in a sense",
    "the powers of @xmath85 are merely placeholders , with the @xmath2 power holding the place for items of size @xmath32 , and the @xmath85 s are not expected to be evaluated .",
    "for example , if there are four ways of having two messages delivered , three ways of having one message delivered , and one way of having no messages delivered , then the generating function is @xmath87 . for a counting problem a generating function",
    "is set up that models the problem and then the required coefficient is extracted .",
    "the notation @xmath88 $ ] means `` the coefficient of @xmath86 . ''",
    "thus in the example , @xmath89(1 + 3x+4x^2)$ ] will give us the value @xmath90 .",
    "generating functions have the advantage that they encode all the enumerative information and they can easily be manipulated , e.g. multiplied together .",
    "the extraction of a coefficient can prove to be a challenge sometimes if a direct formula for it is not easily obtainable . in this case",
    "a symbolic computation program such as maple can be an important tool .",
    "turning to our specific problem , the generating function allows us , given the number of messages sent and received by various users , to determine exactly the number of ways this could take place . if there are a lot of ways for this to take place then the system does not leak much information and remains relatively anonymous . if there are only a few ways for this to take place then the system is leaking a lot of information .",
    "we define our degree of anonymity precisely as follows .",
    "as mentioned above , we take a ratio with the denominator representing the system with the most anonymity , i.e a system in which each user sends or receives a single message . in this system",
    "our approach is no better than counting perfect matchings and there are @xmath29 possibilities .",
    "the numerator is the number of ways the @xmath6 messages could be divided up .",
    "this is the coefficient of @xmath91 in the generating function , @xmath92 , for the number of ways of @xmath6 messages being received such that the @xmath32th user receives @xmath93 messages , for @xmath94 .",
    "thus the degree is @xmath95 gf)}{\\log(n!)}.\\ ] ]    now we consider the form of the generating function , @xmath92 , for this problem .",
    "this generating function is a special type of function called a _",
    "symmetric function_. first , a number of further definitions are required .",
    "a symmetric function @xmath96 in variables @xmath97 is a function such that a permutation of the variables does not change the value of the function , i.e. @xmath98 . then the _ homogeneous symmetric function _ of degree @xmath99 , @xmath100 , is the sum of all homogeneous terms in @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102    the homogeneous symmetric functions can also be defined for infinite sets of variables .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath103 a partition of @xmath6 , where @xmath104 ( i.e.  a nondecreasing sequence of nonnegative integers that sum to @xmath6 ) , then @xmath105 is defined as the product @xmath106 .    given that @xmath3 messages are sent by each sender , @xmath107 , and that @xmath93 messages are received by each receiver , @xmath108 , in a round , the number of ways this could happen is @xmath109 h_{r_{1 } } ( { \\bf x } ) h_{r_{2 } } ( { \\bf x } ) \\ldots h_{r_{\\ell } } ( { \\bf x})\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the homogeneous symmetric function of degree @xmath113 .",
    "[ thm1 ]    proof : the term @xmath114 counts the number of different ways @xmath99 elements could be received where the elements are drawn from @xmath115 ( e.g. if there were three elements received and two possible kinds of elements , then this is @xmath116 ) .",
    "the product @xmath117 is , by the product lemma in enumerative combinatorics @xcite[pp36 - 37 ] , the generating function for the number of ways of one user receiving @xmath10 elements , a second user receiving @xmath11 elements , etc , simultaneously .",

    "the entire expression in the statement of the theorem thus counts in general the number of ways @xmath3 @xmath32 s could be sent and @xmath93 @xmath32 s could be received .",
    "thus the generating function we require is a symmetric function and we can define our degree of anonymity to be @xmath120 h_{r_{1 } } ( { \\bf x } ) h_{r_{2 } } ( { \\bf x } ) \\ldots h_{r_{\\ell } } ( { \\bf x } ) ) } { \\log(n!)}. \\label{dega}\\ ] ] where there are @xmath0 senders and @xmath1 receivers , the @xmath2 sender sends @xmath3 messages in a round and the @xmath4 receiver receives @xmath5 messages in a round , and that the total number of messages sent in a round is @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath121 .    consider an example . recall that earlier we showed the example of an input / output round of three messages sent by @xmath13 , three messages sent by @xmath15 , two messages sent by @xmath17 , five messages received by @xmath18 , and three messages received by @xmath19 . in our generating function terms this means that we need two complete generating functions : @xmath122 for @xmath18 and @xmath123 for @xmath19 ( since @xmath18 receives five messages and @xmath19 receives three messages ) .",
    "since there are three users sending messages , the number of variables for each generating function is limited to three . since we know that @xmath13 sends three messages , @xmath15 sends three messages , and @xmath17 sends two messages , we require the coefficient of @xmath124 . specifically ,    @xmath125    and    @xmath126    we can multiply these two generating functions together and collect terms ( admittedly a slow process , but we will improve on it in section [ extract ] ) .",
    "this approach shows that @xmath127 has nine terms of the form @xmath128 formed from the following products : @xmath129 ; @xmath130 ; @xmath131 ; @xmath132 ; @xmath133 ; @xmath134 ; @xmath135 ; @xmath136 @xmath137 ; . +",

    "since there are eight messages involved , there are @xmath140 ways to send them , a substantially larger number of possibilities .",
    "our degree of anonymity is @xmath141 whereas the degree of anonymity of edman _",
    "is @xmath142 .",
    "recall from section [ details ] that the generating function for the problem is the homogeneous symmetric function @xmath105 and that in order to evaluate our degree of anonymity , @xmath143 , in equation ( [ dega ] ) we need to extract the coefficient .",
    "this section explores the theoretical basis for this extraction and explains the calculation that needs to be made .",
    "symmetric functions form a _",
    "graded ring_. the most natural basis for this ring is the set of _ monomial _ symmetric functions .",
    "the monomial symmetric functions , @xmath144 , are defined as @xmath145 where the sum ranges over all distinct permutations @xmath146 of the entries of the partition @xmath147 .",

    "it is defined such that @xmath151 where @xmath152 equals @xmath142 if @xmath153 and @xmath82 otherwise .",
    "note in particular that , although the monomial symmetric functions , and indeed the homogeneous symmetric functions , are both bases for the ring of symmetric functions , neither is an orthonormal basis with this scalar product .",

    ". then @xmath155    thus to compute the number of ways @xmath0 senders could send @xmath156 messages and @xmath1 receivers could receive @xmath157 messages , we calculate the scalar product @xmath158 .",
    "the step - by - step justification for the procedure to calculate the number of ways @xmath0 senders and @xmath1 receivers send @xmath6 messages in a round such that the @xmath2 sender sends @xmath3 messages and the @xmath4 receiver receives @xmath5 messages , is as follows :    1 .   by theorem [ thm1 ]",
    "this number can be represented by @xmath159 h_{r_{1 } } ( { \\bf x } ) h_{r_{2 } } ( { \\bf x } ) \\ldots h_{r_{\\ell } } ( { \\bf x})$ ] .",

    "is the generating function for a sender sending @xmath162 messages , and @xmath163 is the generating function for @xmath0 senders with the @xmath2 sender sending @xmath3 messages . similarly for receivers .",
    "now that we can extract the coefficient via the scalar product , we can calculate our degree of anonymity , @xmath143 .",
    "however , with the exception of a few special cases , obtaining a closed form expression for the scalar product is difficult .",
    "the alternative is to use a symbolic computation package , such as maple , to calculate the scalar product . in the next section",
    "we outline the results we obtained using such a program .",
    "the computations presented here were carried out using maple 8 and the symmetric functions package , sf , written by john stembridge @xcite .",
    "all of the calculations mentioned ran in a few seconds or less .",
    "we have already discussed the extremes of the metric ( i.e. when alice sends all messages , or when each user sends exactly one ) and have discussed how it discerns between cases better than the metric of edman _ et al . _ in this section we conduct a number of experiments on the metric and discover a number of patterns and trends . in particular we explore what the metric looks like , some interesting features of it , and answers to some interesting questions .    the two figures , figure 1 and figure 2 , illustrate the behaviour of the metric from more favourable ( anonymous ) to less favourable situations , based on two different scenarios where alice s communications become predominant .",

    "this metric has many interesting features , as illustrated by the following example for @xmath164 .",
    "we have calculated the coefficients for all sender - receiver combinations for @xmath164 messages and the results are shown in a table in the appendix .",
    "note that in the table we have taken advantage of symmetry , i.e. @xmath165 senders and @xmath166 receivers gives the same coefficient as @xmath167 senders and @xmath168 receivers .",
    "we have worked with @xmath164 because the number of cases to consider is tractable and the coefficients obtained are small enough to be meaningful ; however , the calculations also run in seconds on larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "the table shows clearly that , as one would expect , a lot of senders sending a few messages each ( or a lot of receivers , receiving few messages each ) results in the most anonymity .",
    "a closer examination of the table reveals a number of interesting facts .",
    "first , coalescing a sender of a single message into another sender ( e.g. going from @xmath169 to @xmath170 ) cuts the coefficient by a factor proportional to the new sender s number of messages , a dramatic reduction in the anonymity .",
    "more precisely , going from @xmath171 to @xmath172 divides the coefficient by @xmath172 .",
    "the same applies to receivers .",
    "the coefficient is cut by a smaller amount because the log smooths the function .",
    "second , there are counterintuitive instances as well where more senders ( resp . receivers ) and fewer messages is not superior . for example , @xmath173 has a coefficient of @xmath174 and degree @xmath175 and @xmath176 has a coefficient of @xmath177 and coefficient @xmath178 , yet the first sender - receiver pair has more senders .",
    "of course the second has more receivers .",
    "a further interesting case is @xmath179 with coefficient @xmath180 and degree 0.345 , and @xmath181 with coefficient @xmath182 and degree @xmath183 , and thus a barely discernable difference between the coefficients and degree , yet the second group has more receivers .",
    "it can be difficult to strike a hard and fast rule about which is better .",
    "third , it is actually relatively easy to rank the partitions from most anonymous to least .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we can outline a procedure for calculating the cardinality of the equivalence classes as required for the metric of gierlichs _ et al . _",
    "we know the size of both the sender sets and the receiver sets .",
    "suppose there are @xmath35 sender sets and @xmath113 receiver sets .",
    "each receiver set will consist of elements from the sender sets in some combination .    1 .",
    "first determine all integer partitions of each of the receiver sets .",
    "this can be done , for example , with the algorithm from @xcite .",
    "the integer partitions will count the number of possible ways the sender sets can be partitioned in the receiver set . for example , if the receiver set has @xmath60 elements then the partitions are : @xmath184 ; @xmath185 ; @xmath60 .",
    "we could have one element from each sender set , two elements from one of the sender sets and another element from another sender set , or all elements from a single sender set .",
    "however , the problem here is that determining this properly is probably equivalent to explicitly determining the equivalence classes to begin with and this laborious procedure is something we avoid through the power of our symmetric function method .",
    "we want to find all sequences @xmath186 such that @xmath187 .",
    "but we want for the same set of @xmath188 s to find all sequences @xmath189 such that @xmath190 .",
    "this could be done either by exhaustive search or through an integer programming approach .",
    "since we have determined how many ways each sender set could be partitioned so that @xmath191 elements go to receiver set @xmath32 for @xmath107 , we can construct a series of multinomial coefficients of the form @xmath192 .",
    "3 .   now the elements within each receiver set of size @xmath93 can be arranged in @xmath193 ways ."
