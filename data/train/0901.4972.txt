    "the importance of electromagnetic processes during bunch collisions at colliders is well appreciated .",
    "indeed , photons emitted in the collision of dense bunches consisting of electron or positrons are a source for a number of problems related to energy losses and background . in particular , at the international linear collider ( ilc ) , we have to know the spectrum of photons down to an energy of about 1  ev because such photons can produce high - energy photons after compton scattering .",
    "as shown here , for photon energies below about @xmath13  kev , the usual beamstrahlung treatment of photoemission breaks down because the coherence length becomes comparable to the bunch length . a treatment based on classical currents",
    "is used here in order to describe the long - coherence - length limit of bremsstrahlung , where the electrons interact with the collective field of the incoming positron ( or ion ) bunch .",
    "in addition to a calculation of the spectrum of low energy photons , we find a specific dependence of the photon rate on the impact parameters between the two bunch axes , namely , we find that the number of emitted photons exhibits a maximum at a non - vanishing beam axis displacement , even though the luminosity is a monotonically decreasing function of the shift of the beam axes .",
    "this anomaly finds a natural explanation in a classical treatment .    here ,",
