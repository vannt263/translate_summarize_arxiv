    "d ( sgrd ) is one of the most intense radio sources in the galactic center ( gc ) region known from the earliest days of gc radio observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is composed of an h region ( sgrd h region or g1.130.10 ) and a supernova remnant ( snr ; sgrd snr or g1.050.15 ) adjoining each other ( figure  [ fig : fullimg]a ) .",
    "low - resolution radio continuum observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) identified thermal emission from the h region and nonthermal emission from the snr .    the sgrd h region is associated with its natal giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , which has a velocity different from those typical of gmcs in the galactic nuclear disk such as sgrb2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in higher resolution",
    "radio continuum images ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the sgrd h region is comprised of several components of different spatial scales . throughout this paper",
    ", we call the entire region `` the sgrd h complex '' and treat three components separately ( figure  [ fig : fullimg]a ) : ( 1 ) `` core '' , the brightest knot , which is referred to as `` g1.120.10 '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or the `` compact h region '' ( @xcite ) , ( 2 ) `` extended '' , a @xmath2 shell surrounding the `` core '' ( @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) `` tail '' , the structure extending eastward from the `` extended '' component , which is labeled `` g1.2 + 0.0 '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the `` core '' is an h region with a lyman continuum photon intensity equivalent of an o5.5 star based on its infrared properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter two structures may be at the edge of the h region ; the `` extended '' component is created by ionizing photons from the `` core '' and the `` tail '' by gas escaping away from the `` extended '' component ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observational results , however , are diverging away from this view of the sgrd h complex .",
    "there are two contradictory estimates of its distance .",
    "narrow molecular line emission and broad h@xmath8co absorption features indicate that the complex is on the far side of the gc region ( @xcite ) , whereas the near - infrared star counts around the `` core '' suggest the system lies on the near side of the gc ( @xcite ) , possibly in the @xmath2160  pc expanding molecular ring ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latest radio continuum study on arcminute spatial scales indicates a mixture of thermal and nonthermal emission in this complex @xcite , which historically had been considered solely a thermal radio source .",
    "these new lines of evidence do not support the long - standing interpretation that the sgrd h complex is a single h region and its environment .",
    "rather , it is more likely that the system is made up of multiple components at various distances projected along the same line of sight .",
    "previous results should be carefully reviewed and new observations should be conducted to better understand the system .",
    "x - ray observations are indispensable in this pursuit",
    ". both snrs and gmcs can be identified through x - ray imaging as emission extended by @xmath210  pc .",
    "the two types of emission can be distinguished by their x - ray spectra ; snrs show thermal plasma with emission lines from highly ionized atoms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while gmcs show emission produced by external x - ray irradiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "h regions are also an emerging class of diffuse x - ray sources with a similar spatial scale .",
    "they show a variety of spectral shapes , including soft thermal ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , hard thermal ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and nonthermal ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) emission .",
    "in addition to the x - ray emission , the measurement of the x - ray absorption gives a constraint on the distance and hence the physical scale of extended objects .",
    "several x - ray observations were reported in the sgrd region . in a bepposax study ( ) ,",
    "diffuse x - ray emission was significantly detected from the sgrd snr and marginally detected from the sgrd h complex . in an asca study ( @xcite ) , the image was plagued by stray lights from a nearby bright source and was unsuitable to search for diffuse x - ray sources . in an xmm - newton study ( ) ,",
    "dozens of point sources were identified , but no diffuse emission was detected presumably due to high background .",
    "the possible diffuse x - ray detection by bepposax in the sgrd h complex has not been confirmed and no spectral information exists for this source .",
    "we conducted x - ray observations of the sgrd h complex using the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) onboard suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low background of xis makes it particularly well - suited for finding diffuse sources of low surface brightness and yielding their high signal - to - noise ratio spectra .",
    "indeed , a series of xis studies in the gc region identified several new snrs and irradiated gmcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and reported detailed spectroscopy of an h region ( @xcite ) . upon the confirmation of",
    "the previously claimed marginal diffuse detection in the sgrd h complex , we further aim to construct the x - ray spectrum which gives important insights into the origin of the emission and the entire complex .",
    "here , we present a significant detection of diffuse x - ray emission from the sgrd h complex with the suzaku xis .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectra were obtained from two different diffuse sources .",
    "we discuss their x - ray characteristics and their association with sources observed in our study using the 100  m green bank telescope ( gbt ) and in other archived multiwavelength data sets .",
    "based on these data , we propose a new view of the sgrd h complex . in this paper , we supplement the suzaku data with those taken by xmm - newton in order to evaluate the contribution of point sources to the diffuse emission . throughout this paper , we use east and west in the galactic longitude direction , and north and south in the galactic latitude direction for simplicity .",
    "( 180mm,140mm)1.jpg      we used two xis fields covering the sgrd h complex in the suzaku gc mapping project ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we hereafter call the two fields as north and south field ( figure  [ fig : fullimg]a ) .",
    "the north field covers the entire complex .",
    "the overlapping area of the north and south fields also cover a part of the complex , for which we additionally use the south field data .",
    "results in the remaining part of the south field will be reported in a separate paper .",
    "the xis consists of four ccd cameras ( xis 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) each placed at the focal planes of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt : serlemitsos et al .",
    "one of the cameras ( xis  1 ) uses a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd while the others ( xis  0 , 2 , and 3 ) use front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds .",
    "one of the fis ( xis  2 ) has not been functional since an unexpected anomaly in 2006 november .    the xis is sensitive in an energy range of 0.212  kev with the fi ccds superior in the hard band and the bi ccd in the soft band .",
    "for the purpose of mitigating the degradation of the energy resolution in the orbit , the xis employs the spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) technique ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "artificial charges are periodically injected to fill charge traps caused by radiation damage in order to reduce the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) . in the present data , the resolution at 5.9  kev",
    "is measured to be @xmath2150  ev ( fi ) and @xmath2170  ev ( bi ) in the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) using the @xmath9fe calibration sources installed in the two corners of each ccd .",
    "combined with the xrt , an @xmath0 region is covered with a pixel scale of  pixel@xmath10 .",
    "an angular resolution of  in the half power diameter ( hpd ) is almost independent of the off - axis angles within @xmath210@xmath11 . the total effective area excluding the inoperational xis  2 is @xmath2430  @xmath12 at 8  kev .",
    "due to the suzaku s low orbital altitude at @xmath2550  km , the xis achieves a low and stable background environment suited for studying faint diffuse sources .    in the two observations presented here , the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode with the sci technique .",
    "starting from the pipeline products in the processing version 2.0 , we recalculated the energy scales by taking into account of the time dependence of the cti and the positional dependence of the sci efficiency .",
    "the resultant systematic uncertainty in the energy gain is @xmath1310  ev at 5.9  kev .",
    "we removed events during the south atlantic anomaly passages , earth elevation angles below , and earth day - time elevation angles below .",
    "we also removed hot and flickering pixels .",
    "the net exposures are 62.2 and 139  ks for the north and south fields , respectively .",
    "we reduced the data using the software packages headas version 6.4 and xspec @xcite version 11.3.2 . in the spectral analysis",
    ", we used the redistribution matrix function released on 2006 - 02 - 13 and the auxiliary response function generated by a ray - tracing simulator ( ` xissimarfgen ` : @xcite ) .",
    "we retrieved the archived xmm - newton data to supplement the suzaku data , and found that two observations taken in 2000 and 2005 cover sgrd .",
    "we hereafter refer to them as obs00 and obs05 , respectively ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the obs05 data were presented by , upon which we add the obs00 data to make deeper images .",
    "both data sets were obtained with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , which is comprised of two mos ccds and a pn ccd .",
    "the epic is sensitive in an energy range of 0.110  kev with an energy resolution of @xmath2140  ev ( mos ) and @xmath2170  ev ( pn ) in the fwhm at 5.9  kev for the retrieved data .",
    "the mos and pn cover a @xmath2 diameter circle with a pixel scale of  pixel@xmath10 and  pixel@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the hpd and the total effective area at 8  kev are  at the optical axis and @xmath2900  @xmath12 , respectively . the combination of xmm - newton s large effective area and imaging capability makes epic observations highly sensitive to point sources .",
    "in the two observations , both the mos and the pn were operated in the full frame mode with the medium filter .",
    "we removed events taken during periods with background rates higher than @xmath14  counts  s@xmath10 ( mos ) and @xmath15  counts  s@xmath10 ( pn ) in the 1015  kev energy band .",
    "we also removed hot and flickering pixels .",
    "the resultant effective exposures are shown in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the xmm - newton science analysis system version 7.1.0 was used for reducing the epic data .",
    "figure  [ fig : fullimg ] shows the wide - band ( 0.75.5  kev ) x - ray images obtained with the xis and the epic mos . here , we restricted the energy range to be below 5.5  kev to eliminate the signals from the calibration sources in the xis image .",
    "we find that the sgrd h complex is accompanied by both diffuse and point - like x - ray emission .",
    "the former is more noticeable in the xis image while the latter is in the mos image , reflecting the complementary capability of the two imagers .    in the mos image ( figure  [ fig : fullimg]b ) , we found three bright point - like sources in and around the complex listed in the second xmm - newton serendipitous source catalogue : ps1 ( 2xmm  j174835.9275619 ) , ps2 ( 2xmm j174841.1280136 ) , and ps3 ( 2xmm j174848.7280100 ) .",
    "we matched the astrometric positions between the xis and the mos images using bright and isolated point - like sources .",
    "the absolute astrometry of xmm - newton is accurate to @xmath2 , while that of suzaku can be uncertain up to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the xis south field was shifted to match the mos image by ( @xmath16r.a . , @xmath16dec . ) = ( , ) , while the north field was unchanged as it is consistent with the mos astrometric positions .",
    "xis images were exposed for much longer times than mos images ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "sufficient photon counts enable us to construct both broad - band and narrow - band images with xis .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisimg ] shows the close - up view of the sgrd h complex in four limited energy bands : ( a ) soft ( 0.72.0  kev ) , ( b ) medium ( 2.04.0  kev ) , ( c ) hard ( 4.05.5  kev ) , and ( d ) s k@xmath6 ( 2.42.5  kev ) .    in the three broad - band images ( figure  [ fig : xisimg]a[fig : xisimg]c ) , ps1 appears only in the soft and medium bands , indicating that it is soft , lightly attenuated , and thus a foreground source .",
    "the soft band image lacks diffuse features .",
    "however , in the medium and hard bands , diffuse emission emerges with different colors at the north field center and at the sgrd h core .",
    "we consider that the two diffuse sources are different and call them ds1 and ds2 ( figure  [ fig : xisimg ] ) .    in the narrow - band image tracing the s",
    "k@xmath6 line emission ( figure  [ fig : xisimg]d ) , ps1 and ds1 are conspicuous .",
    "these sources are likely to be thermal emission of a few  kev plasma temperatures .",
    "ds2 , on the contrary , is faint in this band .",

    "we speculate that the h region g1.050.14 is another blister on the other side of the gmc .",
    "h  109@xmath6 emission was detected at this position and its velocity is the same with the gmc ( ) .",
    "it is now clear that sgrd h complex is not a single h region and its environment as was considered in the past .",
    "we propose that an snr and two h regions on both sides of a gmc are projected along the same line of sight .",
    "the snr lies behind the h regions , which is justified by a larger @xmath17 value in ds1 ( a part of the snr ) than in ds2 ( `` core '' ) .",
    "the snr position behind the 100  km  s@xmath10 cloud puts this object in or behind the gc region , whereas the h regions associated with a gmc at @xmath5715  km  s@xmath10 is on the near side of the gc in agreement with the nir star count study ( @xcite ) .",
    "ps1 and ps3 are sources 7 and 11 respectively in the xmm - newton study by .",
    "ps1 has several anonymous nir sources within the positional uncertainty , and its counterpart can not be identified .",
    "ps3 is identified as hd316290 in , which is an f8 star with the _ b_-band and _ v_-band magnitudes of 10.3  mag and 9.8  mag , respectively ( ) .",
    "we consider that both sources are foreground objects from their values of @xmath17 .",
    "assuming an interstellar hydrogen density of @xmath61  1  @xmath40 , we derived the distance to ps1 as @xmath26.8 kpc and constrained that to ps3 as @xmath130.97 kpc , respectively .",
    "the x - ray spectrum and luminosity suggest that both sources are individual stars , but their nature is not constrained any further .",
    "ps2 , on the other hand , shows an @xmath17 value consistent with being in the gc region .",
    "we identify a bright nir source ( star a in @xcite ) within the position uncertainty of ps2 , which is located @xmath28  north to the center of the sgrd h core .",
    "the nir photometry of the star can not distinguish an m giant photosphere with the _",
    "k_-band extinction @xmath62  1.0  mag or 10,000  k blackbody with @xmath62  2.4  mag @xcite .",
    "the x - ray result favors the latter with @xmath17 compatible to the larger @xmath63 value .",
    "similarly to ds1 , we first evaluate the level of contamination by point sources .",
    "two bright point sources ( ps2 and ps3 ) are found in and around ds2 .",
    "ps3 has a different x - ray hardness than ds2 , and its contribution is minor above 2  kev ( figures  [ fig : fitps]c and [ fig : fitds]b ) .",
    "however , the contamination by ps2 is significant . by comparing the time - averaged flux of ps2 by epic and ds2 by xis , @xmath2 40% of 0.78.0  kev counts of ds2 is attributable to ps2 .",
    "similar spectral shapes between ps2 and ds2 ( figures  [ fig : fitps]b and [ fig : fitds]b ) and the xis detection of a marginal flux variation during the north field observation indicate that a significant fraction of the ds2 emission stems from ps2 .",
    "nevertheless , ps2 alone can not account for all properties of ds2 .",
    "ds2 has an extent inconsistent with a single point source .",
    "figure  [ fig : radpro ] shows the background - subtracted radial profile of ds2 around ps2 in comparison to a simulated radial profile of a point - like source .",
    "the excess emission is noticeable in the profile as well as in the x - ray image ( figure  [ fig : xisimg]c ) , where the diffuse emission is localized to the northeast of ps2 .    the origin of the excess emission is uncertain",
    ". it can be either an ensemble of numerous unresolved point sources or the truly extended emission associated with the h region . considering a large concentration of stars in the sgrd h core ( @xcite ; )",
    ", the former possibility is likely .",
    "if it is of an extended nature , ds2 has quite a hard thermal spectrum for diffuse emission in h regions , which is comparable to only a few cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity ( table  [ tab : specpar ] ) above one solar is larger than diffuse x - ray emission in other h regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , which may be due to the enhanced metallicity in the gc region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the current data do not give a conclusive interpretation for this emission .",
    "further observations are expected .",
    "we presented a suzaku x - ray study of the sgrd h complex .",
    "xis detected two diffuse x - ray sources and obtained their high signal - to - noise ratio spectra for the first time .",
    "both sources have a thermal origin with emission lines from highly ionized atoms .",
    "one of the diffuse sources is associated with an h region and the other is a newly identified source .",
    "we use the x - ray characteristics to conclude that the new source is a new snr in the gc region .",
    "the radio continuum data reinforces the idea .    by assembling images across wavelengths",
    ", we proposed a new view of the sgrd h complex .",
    "it is a projection of an snr in or beyond the gc and a gmc with two blister h region in front of it .",
    "this revises a long - standing view that the sgrd h region is a single h region and its environment .    in this study",
    ", we demonstrated the capability of suzaku xis to investigate diffuse x - ray emission at low surface brightnesses . along with the high - resolution radio and infrared images ,",
    "the suzaku x - ray data played a critical role in better understanding sgrd , which is conceivably the case for other regions in the gc as well .",
    "the authors thank shigeo yamauchi at iwate university and eric d. feigelson at pennsylvania state university for improving the draft and tomoharu oka at keio university for providing the co data .",
