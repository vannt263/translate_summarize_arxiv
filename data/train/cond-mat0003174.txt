    "standard models for studying collective complex behavior in natural systems consist typically of ensembles of interacting dynamical elements @xcite .",
    "such kind of models has proven to be extremely versatile in the mathematical description , both analytical and numerical , of a wide variety of phenomena within the scopes of physics , biology , and other branches of science @xcite . according to the range of the involved interactions",
    ", these models can be divided into two well distinct classes .",
    "local interactions which are paradigmatically represented in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite give rise to macroscopic evolution in which space variables play a relevant role , such as spatial structures and propagation phenomena . on the other hand , with global interactions where the coupling range is of the order of , or larger than , the system size space becomes irrelevant and collective behavior is observed to develop in time , typically , in the form of synchronization @xcite .",
    "an essential model of globally coupled elements is given by a set of @xmath0 identical oscillators described , in the so - called phase approximation , by phase variables @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "their evolution is governed by the equations @xmath3 it is known that , for any value of the coupling intensity @xmath4 , all the elements converge to a single orbit whose frequency @xmath5 coincides with that of an individual oscillator @xcite . in this case , @xmath6 measures the time required to reach such synchronized state .    in this note",
    "we present results on a generalization of the above model , where time delays are introduced .",
    "the effect of time delays in synchronization phenomena has already been considered for two - oscillator systems , both periodic @xcite and chaotic @xcite .",
    "ensembles with local interactions @xcite and globally interacting inhomogeneous systems have also been studied @xcite .",
    "none of these contributions make however explicit reference to the relevant case where interactions are global but their propagation occurs at a finite velocity @xmath7 .",
    "this situation , which naturally introduces time delays , provides a realistic description of highly connected systems where the time scales associated with individual evolution and with mutual signal transmission are comparable . instances of such systems are neural and informatic networks @xcite , and biological populations with relatively slow communication media such as sound @xcite .",
    "our main result is that , since a finite signal velocity makes spatial variables relevant even when interactions are global , globally coupled ensembles with time delays exhibit typical features of systems driven by local interactions , in particular , structure formation and propagation .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 identical oscillators in the phase approximation , governed by the equations @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the time required for the signal to travel from element @xmath10 to element @xmath11 at velocity @xmath7 , and @xmath12 is the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that coupling is still global , since its intensity @xmath4 does not depend on the distance between elements .",
    "however , the relative position of the oscillators becomes now relevant through time delays .",
    "the full specification of our system requires to fix the topology and the metric properties of the ensemble , by fixing the values @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , initial conditions for @xmath14 must be provided . in the case of delay equations like ( [ ens ] ) , it is necessary to specify the evolution of @xmath14 at times prior to @xmath15 up to a time @xmath16 @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall assume that for @xmath17 the oscillators evolve independently from each other at their proper frequency @xmath5 and with random relative phases .",
    "namely , for @xmath17 we have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is chosen at random from a uniform distribution in @xmath20 . at @xmath15 coupling in",
    "switched on , so that we formally have a time - dependent coupling intensity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the heaviside step function .    through extensive numerical calculations for a variety of topologies , ranging from one - dimensional arrays to tree ( ultrametric ) structures",
    ", we have found that the system evolves to a state where all the oscillators have the same frequency . on the other hand ,",
    "in contrast with the case without time delays @xcite , their phases can be different .",
    "this asymptotic state corresponds thus to a situation of frequency synchronization .",
    "the long - time evolution of each oscillator can then be written as @xmath23 , where in general @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the fact that these phases are different could have been expected for topologies where not all the elements are equivalent for instance , when boundaries are present . as we show later , however , such states are also found in homogeneous topologies . in this case , they are associated with propagating structures .    in general , the synchronization frequency is different from the proper frequency of each oscillator , @xmath26 . according to ( [ ens ] ) , the synchronization frequency satisfies @xmath27 note that the sums @xmath28 are in general different for each @xmath11 .",
    "however , their numerical value must coincide if the synchronization frequency is to be well defined . for a given value of @xmath29",
    ", this constraint provides @xmath30 independent equations for the phases @xmath31 : @xmath32 since phases are defined up to an additive constant we can choose for instance @xmath33 , and solve these equations for @xmath34 .",
    "then , @xmath29 can be found self - consistently from ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "for large values of @xmath0 , and due to the involved nonlinearities , this results to be a quite hard numerical problem .",
    "an approximate solution can however been found in the case of short delays , i.e. close to the situation where the system is also synchronized in phase , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that @xmath37 , we can write @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average of the time delays associated with element @xmath11 . taking into account eq .",
    "( [ s = s ] ) , we get @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant , independent of @xmath11 , that can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "this result indicates that , in this short - delay limit , oscillators with small average delays are relatively ahead in the evolution , as their phases are larger .",
    "this is plausibly due to the fact that , in average , they receive the information on the system state before other elements with larger values of @xmath42 , which are thus relatively retarded .",
    "note moreover that in a homogeneous topology all the elements are equivalent , so that @xmath43 is the same for all oscillators . in this case , the system is also synchronized in phase .    within the approximation of short delays ,",
    "the synchronization frequency is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the overall average delay .",
    "it therefore results that @xmath29 is smaller than the proper frequency of each oscillator .",
    "in this note , we specifically focus the attention on the case of one - dimensional arrays .",
    "two different topologies are considered , namely , with periodic boundary conditions where all the elements are equivalent and with free boundaries where the neighborhood of each element depends on its distance to the center of the array . for periodic boundary conditions , which we consider first ,",
    "the distance between two elements is not univoquely defined , since it can be measured around the ring in both directions .",
    "we fix @xmath12 by taking the minimum of these values , namely , @xmath46 ) , the proper frequency @xmath5 can be used to define time units so that , without loss of generality , we fix @xmath47 . moreover , our numerical simulations are restricted to the case @xmath48 . as a matter of fact , we have found that other coupling intensities do not produce qualitatively different results .",
    "note that this would not be the case if the oscillators had chaotic individual dynamics .",
    "in such situation , the value of @xmath4 is expected to control the existence of synchronized states .",
    "we have solved numerically equations ( [ ens ] ) for ensembles of @xmath49 to @xmath50 oscillators with a standard finite - difference scheme . for small values of @xmath51",
    "we find that the above described random - phase initial conditions evolve to a state of synchronized frequency where the phases of all oscillators coincide , @xmath35 for all @xmath11 , @xmath10 .",
    "this fully synchronized state is completely analogous to that of globally coupled identical oscillators without time delays , and corresponds to the approximate solution ( [ appr ] ) for the present homogeneous topology . in this case ,",
    "( [ omega ] ) becomes an autonomous equation for @xmath29 .",
    "the sum in the right - hand side can in fact be explicitly evaluated though its expression depends on @xmath0 being even or odd and the synchronization frequency can be found numerically by standard methods . in general , this equation admits several solutions . for the values of @xmath51 where the state of phase synchronization is encountered , however , there is only one possible value of @xmath29 .    at @xmath52 a qualitative change occurs . above this critical value ,",
    "the asymptotic synchronized state is not characterized by a homogeneous phase anymore .",
    "instead , the phase varies linearly along the system , in such a way that a phase difference @xmath53 accumulates in a whole turn around .",
    "the sign of @xmath54 is defined by the initial condition .",
    "symmetry considerations , in fact , indicate that both signs will be found with equal probability over the set of initial conditions that lead to this kind of asymptotic state .",
    "the individual phases are given by @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 an arbitrary constant .",
    "due to the time evolution of @xmath58 a structure propagates around the system at velocity @xmath59 .",
    "similar qualitative changes are found at larger values of @xmath51 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the asymptotic states modify their phase structure in such a way that the phase difference around the whole system , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , increases progressively .",
    "the corresponding individual evolution is @xmath63 , which defines a propagation velocity @xmath64 .",
    "the synchronization frequency is given by @xmath65.\\ ] ] for @xmath66 this reduces to the case of full synchronization found for small @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the solutions of equation ( [ omegam ] ) for various values of @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "bolder curves indicate the intervals where each mode has been observed in the numerical calculations with random - phase initial conditions .",
    "note the zones where more than one solution exist for @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "are the transitions observed at the above quoted values of @xmath51 actual bifurcations , associated with changes in the stability of the asymptotic states ?",
    "in view of the difficulty of dealing with the linear stability problem for a many - dimensional system with time delays such as ( [ ens ] ) @xcite , we choose to answer this question by numerical means . for a given value of @xmath51",
    "we calculate the frequency @xmath29 of a given mode @xmath67 from equation ( [ omegam ] ) and generate an initial condition which corresponds to that mode added with a certain typically random small perturbation .",
    "then , we run the evolution and study the asymptotic behavior .",
    "this has been carried out for @xmath70 at several values of @xmath51 in ( @xmath71 ) , for a 100-oscillator ensemble . in almost all cases",
    ", it has been found that for sufficiently small perturbations the considered states are stable for any value of @xmath51 .",
    "the only exceptions seem to be the states whose frequencies are multiple solutions of equation ( [ omegam ] ) , since in this case the only stable state correspond to the smallest frequency .",
    "the observed transitions are therefore not related to stability changes in the propagation modes .",
    "rather , several modes coexist and the system is multistable . the specific asymptotic state is thus selected by the initial condition .",
    "the fact that from the random - phase initial conditions considered previously the system evolves to a well defined synchronous mode , whose order @xmath67 grows with @xmath51 , suggests that the attraction basins of the various solutions could considerably vary in size as @xmath51 changes .",
    "indeed , from a probabilistic viewpoint , most initial conditions are of the random - phase type .",
    "initial conditions that , for a given value of @xmath51 , do not evolve to the mode marked with a bold line in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] should be considered probabilistically rare .",
    "we consider now the case of a one - dimensional array with free boundaries . here",
    ", the distance between elements can be defined in the standard form , @xmath72 , so that the time delays are @xmath73 . in this",
    "topology sites are not equivalent .",
    "delays for elements near the center of the array are in average lower than for elements towards the boundaries . as a consequence",
    ", no homogeneous stable states are expected for the coupled ensemble .",
    "numerical results show that , in fact , in the asymptotic evolution all the oscillators have the same frequency , given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{omega2 } \\omega = \\omega-{\\epsilon\\over n}\\sum_j \\sin ( \\omega \\tau_0    @xmath25 for any nearest - neighbor time delay @xmath51 .",
    "unexpectedly , however , the associated spatial structures not always preserve the topological symmetry of the system , as shown in the following .",
    "our numerical calculations for the case of free boundaries correspond to a 100-oscillator ensemble with the random - phase initial conditions described above . for small values of @xmath51",
    "we find a symmetric asymptotic pattern , @xmath75 , where the central elements have larger phases than near the boundaries ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for @xmath76 ) .",
    "this structure corresponds to the approximate solution ( [ appr ] ) which , for this topology , predicts a parabolic phase profile with a maximum at the center of the array . beyond a critical value @xmath77",
    "random - phase initial conditions are instead attracted towards an asymmetric structure , where the phase varies in @xmath78 from one end to the other , and attains a maximum in between .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows such structure for @xmath79 . in average",
    ", of course , half of the realizations produce the symmetric counterpart of this asymptotic state .",
    "the situation changes again at @xmath80 . beyond this point , stationary structures",
    "are again symmetric , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for @xmath81 .",
    "they result however to be more complicated than for small @xmath51 , with inflection points at @xmath82 and a much flatter maximum .",
    "a new critical point occurs at @xmath83 , where phase structures become asymmetric once more ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , for @xmath84 ) .",
    "the phase variation between the ends is similar to that observed for smaller @xmath51 but the intermediate geometry is considerably more complex .    an analytical or semi - analytical study of these structures including their existence and stability properties requires considering the consistency problem discussed in connection with eq .",

    "let us stress for the moment that , though the appearance of spatial structures was to be expected in an inhomogeneous system as the present one - dimensional array with free boundaries , these patterns are found to exhibit an unexpected richness upon variation of @xmath51 including , in particular , symmetry breaking .",
    "we have found that an ensemble of identical globally coupled oscillators with finite interaction velocity , which gives origin to time delays , evolves to an asymptotic state where all the oscillators have the same frequency but different phases .",
    "generally , the synchronization frequency differs from the proper frequency of individual oscillators , so that the dynamics of each element in the collective asymptotic motion does not coincide with its individual ( uncoupled ) dynamics .",
    "phases , in turn , are distributed according to spatial patterns with nontrivial topological and dynamical properties .",
    "specifically , in a one - dimensional periodic array several asymptotic states coexist , corresponding to propagation modes with different velocities . in a bounded one - dimensional array",
    "we have observed stationary phase structures whose symmetry properties depend on the size of time delays .",
    "these features , which are reminiscent of the behavior of reaction - diffusion systems with local interactions , point out sharp differences with the collective motion of coupled oscillators without time delays .",
    "it is natural to ask whether any structure similar to those described above is observed in other , more complex topologies . to advance an answer to this question",
    ", we have performed a preliminary analysis of a two - dimensional array of @xmath87 elements with periodic boundary conditions . in this case , each element can be labeled by two indices , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , according to its cartesian coordinates in the lattice . for algorithmic convenience",
    "we have defined the distance between elements as @xmath90 , with @xmath91 in our case . as above , the delay time is @xmath92 . in complete agreement with the one - dimensional analog",
    ", we have here found that for small @xmath51 the system synchronizes both in frequency and phase . beyond a critical value @xmath93 , instead , propagating phase patterns are observed .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the simplest of these patterns , corresponding to the propagation mode with @xmath94 .",
    "work in progress is being devoted to the detailed characterization of the phase structures described in this note , as well as those that could arise in other topologies .",
    "the next step will be to study the effects of the present kind of time delays in ensembles formed by chaotic oscillators , where coupling competes as a stabilizing mechanism against the inherently unstable dynamics of individual elements .",
