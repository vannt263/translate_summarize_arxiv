    "several facilities are now able to produce sufficient @xmath8 s to enable a study to be made of their interactions with other particles .",
    "in particular , the photon machines mami@xcite and graal@xcite are supplementing the earlier hadronic machines such as saturne@xcite , celsius@xcite and cosy@xcite . the current theoretical interest stems partly from the early indications that the @xmath16 interaction is attractive and so could possibly lead to @xmath8-nucleus quasi - bound states ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical approaches fall into two main categories . in the one ,",
    "the various processes involving @xmath8-meson interactions are described in terms of microscopic models containing baryon resonances and the exchange of different mesons ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) which may be based on a chiral perturbation approach ( e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ) or a quark model ( e.g. ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this approach requires a knowledge of the magnitudes and relative phases of many hadron - hadron couplings several of which are very poorly known .",
    "in addition , since @xmath8 interactions  in the absence of @xmath8-meson beams  can only be studied as final state interactions , one has to exploit relationships between the many processes involved .",
    "for example , in the present note , the main interest is in the reaction a ) @xmath7 .",
    "however , this is dependent on the final state interaction b ) @xmath17 , which in turn depends on the reactions c ) @xmath5 and d ) @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , reactions c ) and d ) are related to e ) @xmath6 . therefore ,",
    "any model that claims to describe reaction a ) must also see its implications in reactions b ) , .. , e ) .",
    "this , we believe , is too ambitious a program at present . at this stage",
    "it is probably more informative to check the consistency between the data of the above five reactions and be able to relate them in terms of a few phenomenological parameters .",
    "when this has been accomplished , it will hopefully be possible to understand these parameters in terms of more microscopic models . with this in mind , in ref .",
    "@xcite a @xmath3-matrix model was developed by the authors to describe the reactions a ) , b ) , c ) and d ) in an energy range of about 100 mev each side of the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "this model was expressed in the form of two coupled channels for @xmath18-wave @xmath19 and @xmath16 scattering with the effect of the two pion channel ( @xmath20 ) being included only implicitly .",
    "the latter was achieved by first introducing the two pion process as a third channel in the @xmath3-matrix and subsequently eliminating that channel as an `` optical potential '' correction to the other two channels .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is not an approximation but is done only for convenience , since we do not address cross sections involving explicitly two final state pions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath8-photoproduction cross section was assumed to be proportional to the elastic @xmath16 cross section ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "however , in practice , it is more convenient to elimate some channels by the `` optical potential '' method used already in ref .",
    "we , therefore , describe in section 2 the above reactions in terms of three separate @xmath22-matrices . in section 3 , we give the fitting strategy and also the numerical results in terms of the 13 parameters needed to specify the @xmath3-matrices .",
    "this section also includes expansions  in terms of the @xmath8 momentum  for the amplitudes of the @xmath17 and @xmath7 reactions near the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion and some conclusions .",
    "in principle , the four channels of interest  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath2  should be treated simultaneously . however , it is more convenient and transparent if the problem is analysed in terms of three separate @xmath22-matrices .",

    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , in view of this lack of uniqueness we do not use the quoted errors of ref .",
    "instead , we make two overall fits where , in the one case , all the errors in ref .",

    "these choices were made so that the resultant @xmath86/dpt for this reaction are comparable to those in the other reactions .",
    "we realise that this procedure is throwing away information . however , the main aim in this work is to study the @xmath7 reaction with the @xmath6 playing only a secondary role as a possible stabilizing effect .",
    "therefore , we want a @xmath3-matrix fit that is good for the well established reactions but , at the same time , also reproduces the qualitative trends in the @xmath6 reaction suggested by refs .",

    "the fits are now systematically worse than in column a with the overall @xmath86/dof increasing from 0.89 to 1.23 in column b. in column c  the case with smaller errors and the larger data base  the fit obtained was quite poor to such an extent that reasonable errors on the parameters could not be extracted .",
    "the latter fit , when all 13 parameters were varied simultaneously , did not give from minuit a migrad result that converged to sensible parameters .",

    "+ 2 ) the main distinguishing feature between the four fits is the relative ability to fit the @xmath82 data , since this is the channel that contributes most to the overall @xmath86/dof  with the @xmath86/dpt s from the other four channels being reasonably constant and comparable to unity in all fits .",
    "this suggests that it will be hard for the present type of analysis to maintain these latter @xmath86/dpt s and , at the same time , achieve a good @xmath86/dpt for the @xmath82 data presented in refs .",

    "therefore , in principle , the reader should be able to reconstruct all three @xmath22-matrices and so determine each of the complex amplitudes needed in the five processes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath120 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". this formalism also enables these amplitudes to be calculated at unphysical energies . for example , in the study of possible @xmath8-nucleus quasi - bound states , the @xmath120 amplitudes are needed below the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "this is easily achieved by simply using an @xmath8 momentum(@xmath121 ) that is purely imaginary .    in spite of the model being very explicit , it is sometimes convenient to have simplified versions of some of the amplitudes .",
    "the ones we consider are those that are expansions in terms of @xmath121 about the @xmath8 threshold  in particular @xmath122 and @xmath123 . the former results in the usual @xmath120 effective range expansion of ref .",

    "@xcite  the increase being 15% for case a and 40% for case b. however , it should be remembered that case b extrapolates the model into a region where the @xmath7 data is lacking , and it is just this reaction that is crucial in determining the scattering length .",
    "given this expansion , then @xmath25 is readily calculated from @xmath122 as in eq .",

    "both of these expansions do very well over the energy range of ref .",
    "for example , with case a at @xmath130mev  an energy that is 50 mev above the @xmath8 threshold  , the expansion of @xmath126 gives 8.4i20.0 @xmath117 compared with the exact value of 7.9i19.7 @xmath117 and the expansion of @xmath127 gives 37.12i5.4 compared with the exact value of 37.08i5.7 .",
    "this latter agreement and the weak energy dependence of this quantity explains why , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the replacement of @xmath131 by @xmath132 was a good approximation , since  as seen from eq .",
    "also the value of @xmath134 in table  [ table1 ] is essentially given by @xmath135@xmath136 . in fig .  5 ,",
    "the real and imaginary components of @xmath26 are shown , when these two expansions are used in eq.[intge ] , which is then inverted to give @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen that they give a good representation over a wide energy range especially for energies below the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "this agreement is very similar to that found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath25 .",
    "it should be added that , if the form of @xmath26 written in eq .",
    "[ kt2 ] is used directly with expansions of @xmath137 and @xmath122 , then the fit is much poorer  as also seen in fig .  5 .",
    "in this paper the authors have developed a simple @xmath3-matrix parametrization that gives , in an energy range of about 100 mev each side of the @xmath8 threshold , a good fit to @xmath4 , @xmath138 and @xmath7 data .",
    "in addition , it has the same trends as the @xmath6 data , which at present is not unique over this energy range . however , this consistent fit should not be considered an end in itself , since it also results in predictions for the @xmath139 @xmath42-wave amplitude . near the @xmath8 threshold",
    "this amplitude has been parametrized in the form of the effective range expansion ",
    "the resultant parameters being given in table  [ table3 ] . since",
    "this expansion is good over a wide energy range each side of the @xmath8 threshold , it is very useful for discussions concerning the possibility of @xmath8-nucleus quasi - bound states e.g. in ref .  @xcite the effective range expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite was used to study the production of @xmath8-nuclei , while ref .",
    "@xcite uses such an expansion to describe @xmath8-nucleus final state interactions .",
    "the indications from table  [ table3 ] are that the @xmath140 scattering length is now larger than that extracted in ref .",
    "this is even more favourable for the existence of @xmath8-nucleus quasi - bound states and may lead to an early onset of nuclear p - wave states , which are easier to detect in the darmstadt experiment outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    one result of the above fits is the extraction of the photon - nucleon-@xmath141(1535 ) coupling constant @xmath142 as indicated in table 1 , which is equivalent to the partial decay width @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "the definition of @xmath143 is not unique , however .",
    "below , this question is elucidated on a simple soluble model of the @xmath22 matrix .",
    "this model is also used to understand the interference of a resonant interaction described by a singularity in the @xmath3 matrix and potential interactions described by the background parameters @xmath145 .",

    "however , when we relax this restriction a new structure is built upon the resonance .",
    "it is determined by the energy dependent term @xmath150,$ ] which generates a zero of the cross section at @xmath151 .",
    "now , it is the @xmath152 that sets a new energy scale , which may be independent of the scale given by the width . for a large @xmath145",
    "one finds the resonance to be accompanied by a nearby zero , whereas for small @xmath153 this zero is moved away beyond the resonance width .",
    "the resonance shape is thus very different from the lorentian : one reason being the strong energy dependence in @xmath154 and another being the pole - background interference .",
    "as discussed above in connection with table  [ table2 ] , it is usually natural to define the partial width of a resonance on the basis of eqs .",
    "[ sepk ] and [ sept ] as @xmath155 . for the best fits to the data",
    "( sets @xmath156 of table 1 ) this equation produces @xmath157 mev and @xmath158 mev respectively .",
    "however , with complicated phenomenological @xmath22 matrices one could define @xmath159 otherwise , e.g. by moulding @xmath22 into the breit - wigner form in the proximity of @xmath160 .",
    "thus , at @xmath161 one has @xmath162 .",
    "inserting from table  [ table2 ] the values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 gives another estimate of @xmath165 .",

    "this results in @xmath176 mev .",
    "the proximity of these three widths reflects the fact that the realistic situation is fairly close to the separability situation described by eqs .",
    "[ sepk ] and [ sept ] .",
    "it is found to hold approximately , for all the parameter sets in table 1 .",
    "there is another , somewhat unexpected effect of the @xmath150 $ ] interference term in eq .",
    "[ sept ] . for @xmath177",
    "one finds that the amplitudes below the resonance are enhanced , and the amplitudes above the resonance are reduced with respect to the pure resonance term .",
    "this effect is seen clearly for the @xmath145 and @xmath178 parameter sets , where below the resonance the @xmath179 parameter in the @xmath16 channel is the largest and the real parts of the @xmath16 scattering lengths given in table  [ table3 ] are also the largest . on the other hand the @xmath180 production cross section , dominated by the final state @xmath16 interactions , become the smallest above the resonance as seen fig .  4 .",
    "one consequence of this effect is that an extension of the @xmath180 cross section measurements to energies above the @xmath9 resonance may by instrumental in fixing more precisely the @xmath16 scattering length . as indicated in the introduction ,",
    "the real part of this scattering length is crucial in the determination of quasibound states in @xmath8few nucleon systems .    on the experimental side",
    "there are several groups @xcite,@xcite studying the @xmath7 reaction in or near this interesting energy range .",
    "the observation of the cross section near and above @xmath92=1540mev would be of great interest enabling a detailed study to be made of the @xmath9 and possibly leading to a better understanding of the internal structure of this object . at present",
    "there is no definite conclusion as to whether or not this resonance structure is due to a pole in the @xmath3-matrix , as advocated here , or arising through coupling to high lying closed channels - see ref .",
