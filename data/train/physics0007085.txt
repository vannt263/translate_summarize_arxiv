    "polarization of noble gases by spin exchange with optically pumped alkali metal vapors @xcite is an important technique for a variety of scientific and technological applications .",
    "polarized noble gases been used for : precise measurements of the neutron spin structure function @xcite ; neutron polarizers and analyzers @xcite ; magnetic resonance imaging @xcite ; studies of gas diffusion in porous media @xcite ; gain media for zeeman masers @xcite ; and tests of fundamental symmetries @xcite .",
    "new tests of fundamental symmetries using polarized noble gases have recently been proposed .",
    "kostelecky and lane recently reported that a @xmath0ne/@xmath1he differential magnetometer could be used to test local lorentz invariance ( lli ) @xcite .",
    "we have proposed to develop a @xmath0ne/@xmath1he dual noble gas maser to carry out such an lli test @xcite .",
    "the spin exchange interaction between alkali and noble gas atoms has been extensively described in the literature @xcite . during spin exchange collisions ,",
    "there is significant overlap of the alkali atom s valence electron wavefunction with the noble gas nucleus which comprises a fermi contact interaction of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron and nuclear spin angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "this interaction leads to exchange of angular momentum between the alkali valence electron and the noble gas nucleus . the valence electron and nucleus experience during the collision a strong magnetic field from the close proximity of their spin magnetic moments . in spite of the small fraction of the time spent in collision",
    ", the average magnetic fields experienced by both the alkali valence electron and the noble gas nucleus can be affected if either the alkali or noble gas species is polarized .",
    "the resultant change in the larmor precession frequency for either species , referred to as the contact shift , is expressed in terms of an enhancement factor @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath8 is defined in terms of the _ total _ shift in the larmor precession frequencies in co - located spherical distributions of magnetizations , induced both by the contact interaction and by the classical magnetic fields generated by the magnetizations .",
    "@xmath8 is the ratio of that total frequency shift ( contact plus classical magnetization ) to the shift that would be induced by the classical magnetization alone .",
    "@xmath8 can be much greater than unity , increasing with increasing @xmath9 of the noble gas nucleus @xcite . in the limit where the formation of alkali - noble gas van der waals molecules is a negligible part of the spin exchange interaction ( true for the experiment reported in this paper ) , a single enhancement factor describes both the contact shift of the noble gas zeeman splitting by the alkali atoms , and vice versa .",
    "@xcite . the frequency shift experienced by noble gas atoms in the presence of polarized alkali atoms , including both the contact shift and",

    "the alkali nuclear magnetic moments do not contribute to the contact shift , but do affect the distant dipole fields produced by the alkali magnetization distribution .",
    "we ignored these effects on the distant dipole fields , since they were too small to bear on the results reported in this work .    in precision measurements , it is important to be able to monitor the absolute polarization of the noble gases .",
    "romalis and cates @xcite demonstrated accurate polarimetry of @xmath1he using the rb zeeman frequency shift due to rb-@xmath1he spin exchange collisions , and made a very precise measurement of the rb-@xmath1he enhancement factor .",
    "future use of @xmath0ne in precision measurement applications would benefit from the use of contact shift polarimetry , but there is at present no published measurement of the rb-@xmath0ne enhancement factor . in this paper",
    "we present the first such measurement .",
    "we measured the net larmor frequency shifts , simultaneously impressed by the presence of polarized rb , on ensembles of polarized @xmath1he and @xmath0ne precessing in the same [ nearly ] spherical glass cell .",
    "the measurement presented in this paper is not the first in which a ratio of contact shift enhancement factors was determined .",
    "measured the shifts of the larmor precession frequencies of rb and k vapors residing in the same cell , induced simultaneously by the presence of polarized @xmath20he @xcite .",
    "the experiment is described in section ii .",
    "determining the ratio of the rb - induced shifts permitted us to divide out the dependence on rb magnetization , and express the @xmath21ne enhancement factor @xmath22 in terms of the @xmath20he enhancement factor @xmath23 .",
    "the very accurate measurement of @xmath23 by romalis and cates determined the absolute contact shift enhancement factor @xmath22 .",
    "analysis of the data is presented in section iii .",
    "suggestions for improved measurements are given in section iv .",
    "we employed a @xmath0ne/@xmath1he dual noble gas zeeman maser to establish simultaneous precession of the @xmath0ne and the @xmath1he in the same sealed glass cell .",
    "the @xmath0ne/@xmath1he maser is a new device that will be described elsewhere ; that description is summarized here .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] is a schematic representation of the maser .",
    "circularly polarized light resonant with the rb d1 transition ( 795 nm ) is generated by a 30 w laser diode array ( lda ) ; the light is directed onto a 1.4 cm dia [ near- ] spherical sealed glass cell containing 228 torr of @xmath0ne , 266 torr of @xmath1he , 31 torr of n@xmath24 , and rb metal of natural isotopic composition @xcite .",
    "the lda light propagates along the axis of a uniform magnetic field of strength 3 gauss .",
    "the field is generated by a precision solenoid/@xmath25-metal - shield system capable of producing a 3 g magnetic field with @xmath26 @xmath25g / cm magnetic field gradients , with no gradient shimming .",
    "the main solenoid was driven using a current source capable of @xmath27 ppm stability over timescales of order 1000 sec .",
    "the glass cell was heated both by the lda light and blown hot air to a temperature of ( @xmath28)@xmath29c ( see sec .",
    "the temperature of the air surrounding the cell was controlled to about 43 mk rms .",
    "the total output power of the lda was actively controlled to about a part in @xmath30 .",
    "the rb was polarized by optical pumping ; the resulting rb electron polarization was very close to unity .",
    "the output power of the lda was about 30w , so that even though it had a very broad ( @xmath31 nm ) linewidth , the on - resonant optical power was roughly 0.5 w. thus , the optical pumping rate was @xmath32 photon absorptions per sec per rb atom .",
    "the rate of rb polarization destruction events per rb atom in the cell was @xmath33 sec@xmath34 so that the rb electron polarization was greater than 0.99 .",
    "pickup coils wound in series were placed in close proximity to the cell .",
    "the coils were excited by the magnetic flux associated with the precession of the polarized noble gases .",
    "the coils were part of a tuned resonant circuit with resonances at both noble gas precession frequencies .",
    "the large current flow induced in the pickup coils by resonant excitation resulted in magnetic fields oscillating at the noble gas nuclear larmor frequencies being impressed back on the precessing atoms .",
    "this feedback resulted in steady state maser operation .",
    "@xmath0ne has nuclear spin 3/2 , and thus a quadrupole moment .",
    "the quadrupole moments of the @xmath0ne ensemble interact coherently with electric field gradients at the glass cell walls , shifting the four zeeman energy levels so as to split the three [ otherwise degenerate ] dipole transitions @xcite .",
    "the splitting is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the angle of the cell s symmetry axis with the magnetic field .",
    "we oriented the cell as close as possible to the `` magic angle '' @xmath37 to minimize the quadrupole splitting .",
    "the quadrupole wall shifts in the cell were not measured ; however , computer simulations indicate that without proper cell orientation , realistic - sized splittings could disrupt @xmath0ne maser oscillation . in any case , @xmath0ne maser oscillation with steady - state amplitude was attained .",
    "we observed a small ( @xmath38 @xmath25hz ) sinusoidal modulation of the @xmath0ne maser frequency .",
    "the period of the modulation was about 16 hr . we speculate that the modulation was a consequence of remnant quadrupole splitting resulting from cell orientation error . in any case , the effect was small , with a period much longer than the duration of our contact shift measurements , and thus was not a source of significant systematic error .",
    "the @xmath1he and @xmath0ne maser signals were presented to a low - noise preamplier .",
    "the preamp output was then analyzed using lockin amplifiers , which were referenced to a set of synchronized signal generators tuned near the noble gas maser frequencies and locked to an h - maser - derived 5 mhz signal .",
    "the phases of both noble gas masers precession were recorded digitally at a sample rate of 1 hz . the a / d sampling trigger was also derived from the master 5 mhz reference .",
    "the measurements consisted of observing the maser phases during a series of reversals of the direction of the rb polarization .",
    "the rb polarization was reversed by rotation of the quarter - wave plates ( fig . 1 ) and was typically achieved in @xmath39 20 sec .",
    "the total duration of a set of reversals was about 1000 sec .",
    ", limited by magnetic field stability as well as the extent to which the noble gas masers steady states were disrupted by the alternating rb polarization .",
    "two sets of reversal data were acquired .",
    "clear changes in the slopes of the phase curves were precisely correlated with reversal of the rb polarization direction ; these frequency changes were the result of the contact shift combined with the [ classical ] shift due to the rb magnetization distribution .",
    "the change of noble gas maser oscillation frequency induced by rb polarization reversal was about 44 mhz for @xmath0ne maser and 71 mhz for the @xmath1he maser .",
    "phase data for the second of the two measurement scans are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "we model the @xmath21ne phase @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and the @xmath41he phase @xmath42 ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) acquired by the lockin amplifiers as evolving according to the following equations : @xmath43 @xmath44 where : @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the gyromagnetic ratio of ne ( he ) ; @xmath22 ( @xmath47 ) is the enhancement factor for ne ( he ) ; @xmath13 is the dimensionless factor to account for the classical magnetic field due to the rb magnetization ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the reference frequencies presented to the lockin amplifiers ; @xmath50 is the time - average magnetic field strength over the time interval ; @xmath51 is the time - dependent deviation of the magnetic field from its mean value ; and @xmath52 is the rb magnetization . note that independent maser frequency measurements determined the ratio of the two gyromagnetic ratios , @xmath53 , to an accuracy much better than 1 ppm .",
    "also , the effects of magnetic fields due to noble gas magnetization fields on the phases have been neglected in comparison to the contact shift effects ; this is reasonable for the noble gas magnetizations of this experiment ( see below ) .",
    "magnetic field drift occurred over the course of the measurement scan .",
    "however , the @xmath21ne and @xmath41he masers are co - located magnetometers , so that we can construct a data set from which the effects of magnetic field drift and rb distant dipole fields have been removed .",
    "we define @xmath54 it is easily shown that @xmath55 aside from a trivial phase offset and known linear phase evolution , @xmath56 reflects the action of the rb contact shifts only : phase evolution due to magnetic fields is subtracted off .",
    "this combined phase profile is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the phase evolution due to the contact shift was a piecewise - linear `` sawtooth '' profile .",
    "since our measurement is derived from computing the differences in slopes between adjacent linear regions of the curve , removal of constant and linear dependence from the phase data had no effect on the measurement .",
    "thus , our plots of the phase data shown in figs . [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] are displayed with mean value and mean slope of zero .",
    "if the rb magnetization were known , one could immediately deduce @xmath22 using eqn ( [ delphi ] ) .",
    "even though the rb electron spin polarization was very close to unity , the density was not known _ a priori_. it was therefore necessary to consider the ratio of contact shifts impressed on the @xmath40 and the @xmath56 phase curves , and then determine the temperature self - consistently .",
    "the data were analyzed in two ways which yielded essentially identical results .",
    "first , we computed the average changes in slope of the phase curves @xmath40 and @xmath56 , caused by the reversals of the rb magnetization .",
    "that is , a least - squares linear fitting routine was used to extract the slope of each piecewise linear region of the phase curves .",
    "the differences in slope of adjacent regions was then recorded for each of the phase curves .",
    "the mean absolute values of the slope differences were then computed for each data set .",
    "we define @xmath57 as the mean of the absolute value of the slope differences for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 as that for the @xmath56 profile .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated as the standard deviation of the mean in the slope differences absolute values .",
    "we define the ratio of mean slope changes as @xmath60 .",
    "the weighted average value for @xmath61 from the two data sets was @xmath62 where a one - sigma uncertainty is reported .",
    "the uncertainty was almost entirely due to that in @xmath57 .",
    "the fractional uncertainty in @xmath59 for both of the data sets was @xmath63 this indicates that rb polarization reversal was achieved to high precision and that the rb magnetization was stable to better than 0.1@xmath64 over the course of the measurements .",
    "the fractional uncertainty in @xmath57 was much larger , @xmath65 , caused by the effects of magnetic field drift . in principle",
    ", we could have analyzed the @xmath66 profile rather than @xmath58 , but magnetic field drift effects were @xmath67 times larger on @xmath68 than @xmath58 , making it impractical to extract slope data from @xmath68 directly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    in our analysis",
    "we did not account for possible variations in frequency due to changes in the noble gas longitudinal polarization that occurred in the course of a measurement .",
    "the magnetization of the noble gases created magnetic fields which varied in time during the course of the each of the two measurement scans , as evidenced by [ small ] maser amplitude changes observed during the scans . a given maser s magnetization field could not affect its own frequency , since magnetization fields were parallel to the magnetization in the near - spherical cell .",
    "however , each maser s frequency was shifted by the other s magnetization , and such shifts did not subtract out of @xmath56 as did magnetic field drift",
    ". the noble gas polarizations underwent both slow drift as well as variations correlated with the rb polarization reversals .",
    "the small uncertainty in the @xmath56 slope differences proves that frequency variations due to slow drift in the noble gas magnetizations had negligible effect .",
    "we also determined that the variations of the noble gas polarization caused by the periodic rb polarization reversal had negligible effect on the contact shift measurement .",
    "periodic reversal of the rb polarization ( i.e. , `` square wave '' modulation of the rb polarization ) induced a `` sawtooth wave '' modulation ( i.e. , integrated square wave ) on the noble gas polarizations of peak - to - peak amplitude approximately @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the rb - noble gas spin exchange rate per noble gas atom , and @xmath71 = time between rb polarization reversals .",
    "thus , the varying noble gas polarizations induced large changes in the maser frequencies over a measurement period : we estimate that a 2.8 mhz shift was induced on the @xmath20he maser by the @xmath21ne polarization variation and a 0.7 mhz shift was induced on the @xmath21ne maser by the @xmath20he polarization variation .",
    "however , given a constant time interval @xmath71 between rb polarization reversals , the _ average _ frequency shifts due to the rb - driven noble gas polarization variations did not change from one period to the next , thus they subtracted out in the calculation of the period - to - period frequency changes @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "we conclude that noble gas polarization - induced magnetic fields had no systematic effect on the measurement of @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to show from eqns ( [ phi_defs ] ) and ( [ delphi ] ) that the ratio @xmath61 can be interpreted as @xmath72 where it is seen that dependence on the rb magnetization divided out .",
    "the value and estimated uncertainty for @xmath61 can then be used to compute the value and uncertainty of the desired contact shift enhancement factor for @xmath21ne , @xmath73 , though the system temperature must be known because @xmath20he contact shift @xmath74 is temperature - dependent . @xmath73 and",
    "the system temperature must be determined self - consistently , and the effect of classical magnetization fields must be accounted for : these questions are addressed below .",
    "we now consider the second method of analyzing the data to obtain a value for @xmath61 , which yielded essentially the same results as the above approach . while this second method is slightly more complex , it is useful because it provides a framework for estimating the size of magnetic field drift in the present measurement .",
    "this second method of extracting a value of @xmath61 from the data considers the phase data sets to be @xmath75-component vectors ( denoted by a tilde ) , where @xmath76 number of data in the set ( @xmath77 for each of the two scans ) .",
    "we use the @xmath56 profile as a model of the shape of the rb magnetization - induced phase ( see eqn [ delphi ] ) .",
    "we then seek to describe the @xmath78 profile vector as a linear combination of elements of a partial basis of orthonormal vectors .",
    "the partial basis included an element corresponding to the [ normalized ] @xmath56 profile ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "additional basis vectors orthogonal to it , @xmath80 were derived from @xmath56 and legendre polynomials @xmath81 using gram - schmidt orthogonalization @xcite .",
    "the number of basis vectors @xmath82 was of order @xmath83 , whereas the dimension of the vector space @xmath75 was of order @xmath84 , so @xmath85 , and we find : @xmath86 the coefficient of @xmath87 in this linear combination , @xmath88 , was proportional to the value for @xmath61 obtained from that data set .",
    "the coefficients of the linear combination were determined using linear least squares fitting and by simple projection of @xmath89 onto the vectors of the partial basis , with identical results .",
    "the number of elements in the basis set was varied , but the coefficients obtained from the least squares fit remained the same regardless of the size of the basis set .    using this second data analysis method , we thus determined two values of @xmath61 , one from each data set .",
    "it was not possible to estimate uncertainties for the individual values of @xmath61 from the vector analysis method .",
    "uncertainty estimates from the least squares analyses were unrealistically small because the vector analysis could not account for the effect of a non - zero projection of the magnetic field drifts along the rb magnetization - induced phase profile vectors .",
    "we take the value of @xmath61 to be the mean of the results for the two data sets , and we coarsely estimate the uncertainty of @xmath61 as the deviation of the two values , to obtain @xmath90 .",
    "this result agrees well with that of the first method of data analysis . for computing @xmath73 we will use the result from the first method of analysis since",
    "the error estimate is probably more reliable .",
    "we can compute the magnetic field drift profile by subtracting from @xmath91 its projection on the rb magnetization basis profile @xmath87 : @xmath92 note that the profile @xmath93 is the magnetic field drift _ orthogonal _ to @xmath87 . the drift profile from the second data set",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ; the time derivative of the [ discretely sampled ] profile was estimated by finite difference .",
    "note that the field was stable to about @xmath94 ppm rms .",
    "having obtained a value for @xmath61 , we can then solve eqn ( [ r_defn ] ) for @xmath22 in terms of measured parameters , since @xmath47 is known @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath22 is expected to be temperature - dependent @xcite and so the temperature at which the experiment was carried out must be reported along with the value of @xmath73 . the rb and noble gas temperature indicated by the hot air temperature control system was in error , because : the absolute calibration was poorly known ; and the cell was heated by the lda to a temperature higher than that indicated by the control system .",
    "thus , it was necessary to deduce the noble gas / rb vapor temperature from the contact shift data , and the known @xmath20he enhancement factor ( with its known temperature dependence ) , in a self - consistent way .",
    "this was achieved by first noting that the mean slope change @xmath59 is related to the enhancement factors and the rb magnetization via @xmath95 where @xmath96 ( see eqn ( [ m_vs_p ] ) above ) is a known function of temperature .",
    "the rb number density @xmath97 $ ] is related to temperature by @xcite @xmath98={{10^{9.318-{{4040 } \\over t } } } \\over { \\left ( { 1.38\\cdot 10^{-17 } }   \\right)\\cdot t}}cm^{-3}\\ \\ \\left ( { t\\ in\\ { } ^ok } \\right)$$ \\label{n_rb_vs_t}\\ ] ] the measured temperature dependence of the @xmath20he enhancement factor is @xcite @xmath99 \\label{kappa_3_vs_t}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ n_rb_vs_t ] ) and ( [ m_vs_p ] ) into ( [ delta_m_vs_m_rb ] ) yields an equation relating @xmath22 and temperature ( and known / measured parameters ) . substituting ( [ kappa_3_vs_t ] ) into ( [ r_defn ] ) yields another equation relating @xmath22 and temperature .",
    "this system of two [ nonlinear ] equations and two unknowns can be solved to yield the temperature and @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature determination depends strongly on the enhancement factor , while the enhancement factor determination depends only weakly on the temperature ( via the known temperature dependence of @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , an iterative method to compute the temperature rapidly converges : an initial guess for the temperature enables calculation of @xmath22 , which in turn permits calculation of the rb magnetization and thus the system temperature .",
    "this corrected temperature is used to re - compute a better estimate for @xmath22 , which is used to re - compute a better estimate of the rb magnetization , etc .    using the result @xmath100 from the slope difference analysis",
    ", we determine the contact shift enhancement factor for rb and @xmath21ne to be @xmath101 at a temperature of @xmath102c .",
    "note that the noble gas / rb vapor temperature is much higher than the value of @xmath103c indicated by the hot air temperature control system , presumably the result of heating by the laser diode array .",
    "we are not aware of a previous measurement of the rb-@xmath21ne contact shift .",
    "walker estimated the rb-@xmath21ne enhancement factor to be 38 , and the ratio of the rb-@xmath21ne and rb-@xmath41he enhancement factors to be 4.3 @xcite .",
    "we report this ratio to be @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath105 uncertainty in @xmath61 dominates other sources of error , inducing a @xmath106 uncertainty in @xmath22 .",
    "the contribution to the uncertainty in @xmath22 resulting from the @xmath107 uncertainty in the he enhancement factor @xmath47 is only @xmath107 , which is negligible .",
    "the uncertainty in temperature induced a @xmath108 uncertainty in @xmath22 . to the extent that the cell could be described as an ellipsoid of revolution ,",
    "its deviation from sphericality induced an uncertainty of @xmath109 in @xmath22 with zero systematic correction .",
    "the claim of zero systematic correction of the classical magnetization field shift for a ellipsoidal cell is justified by noting that : i ) the classical magnetization field inside an ellipsoid of uniform magnetization is uniform , with its magnitude depending on the ellipsoid s shape and the relative orientation of the ellipsoid major axis and the magnetization vector ; and ii ) when the ellipsoid major axis is oriented at the magic angle @xmath110 with respect to the magnetization direction , the component of the classical magnetization field parallel to the magnetization is exactly that of a spherical distribution with the same magnetization , regardless of the ellipsoid s shape .",
    "we oriented the cell at @xmath111 in order to suppress quadrupole wall shifts , with an uncertainty of about @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath112 uncertainty in orientation leads to the estimated uncertainty of @xmath109 in @xmath22 due to measured asphericality of the cell .",
    "there are straightforward improvements that could be implemented to reduce the uncertainty in the present measurement .",
    "the experiment was conducted in the course of developing a @xmath21ne/@xmath41he dual zeeman maser , so that opportunity for taking contact shift data was very limited .",
    "a factor of three improvement in the result could easily be achieved just by taking ten times more data .",
    "active field stabilization using an independent magnetometer @xcite would essentially eliminate field drift , reducing statistical uncertainty in the measurement to that due to phase noise , a factor of @xmath113 reduction .",
    "active field stabilization would also permit a reduction in the phase noise since the signal acquisition bandwidth could be reduced by at least a factor of 3 , so that the statistical uncertainty could be reduced by about a factor of 300 compared to the present experiment .",
    "this uncertainty would already be less than the uncertainty contributed by cell asphericality ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "however , the absolute uncertainty in the rb-@xmath21ne contact shift enhancement factor @xmath22 would then be limited by the uncertainty in that for he , @xmath23 , @xmath107 , whereas the ratio @xmath114 would be known to an uncertainty of only a few tenths of one percent",
    ".    it should be possible to measure ratios of alkali - noble gas enhancement factors to a level well below a part in @xmath84 if one could completely eliminate effects of the classical magnetization field shift .",
    "we have already shown that one can use differential magnetometry to obtain data from which classical magnetization field shifts are eliminated to high precision .",
    "it can be shown that using a three - species noble gas maser , one could measure the contact shift enhancement factor of a third species if the other species enhancement factors are known , _ independent of the classical magnetization field shift_. even though it has not yet been done , we believe it is a straightforward matter to implement a three - species maser in a single - bulb glass cell .    a comprehensive set of contact shift data would serve as a probe of noble gas - alkali interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "a program using multi - species noble gas masers to measure contact shift ratios could be implemented using @xmath115xe , @xmath116kr , @xmath21ne , and @xmath41he along with k , cs , and rb in turn .",
    "na would be a poor candidate for use in a noble gas maser because of its relatively low vapor pressure .",
    "the remaining stable noble gas isotope , @xmath117xe , can not be used with the other noble gases in a multi - species maser because its nuclear dipole moment has a sign opposite to that of the others ( making it impossible to achieve a population inversion simultaneously with the other species ) .",
    "however , it may be possible to measure the @xmath117xe precession frequency in free induction decay in the presence of two other noble gas masers .",
    "there are no other stable noble gas isotopes having non - zero nuclear spin .",
    "contact shift ratios would be converted to absolute values for enhancement factors by using the measured values for @xmath41he / rb @xcite and @xmath41he / k @xcite .",
    "the enhancement factor for @xmath41he / cs has not yet been measured .",
    "measuring contact shift ratios to a few parts in @xmath30 could proceed as follows : one would first measure the ratio of the enhancement factors of @xmath116kr and @xmath115xe to each other .",
    "the contact shift enhancement factors for @xmath116kr and @xmath115xe are estimated by walker to be about 230 and 730 , respectively @xcite . using an independent magnetometer with the colocated xe - kr masers ,",
    "the ratio of the [ large ] enhancement factors of xe and kr could be measured to a few parts in @xmath30 even if the classical magnetization field were accounted for only to the @xmath118 level ( which can be done trivially- a @xmath119 accounting is claimed in this work ) .",
    "triple masers using kr and xe , along with @xmath21ne and @xmath41he in turn would yield high - precision measurements of the ratios of all the enhancement factors ; the known enhancement factor for he would then determine the absolute values of the other enhancement factors .",
    "temperature dependences could of course also be measured . in particular , enhancement factor ratios as a function of density ( normalized to some experimental reference density )",
    "could be determined to very high precision .",
    "improved cell thermometry would eliminate the need to depend on a temperature - density calibration @xcite to determine the cell temperature .",
    "also , for very high precision measurements , control of the noble gas magnetization fields would have to be maintained more carefully than in the present work ; in particular , the time between polarization reversals could be decreased in order to increase the relative size of the contact shifts in comparison to noble gas polarization induced frequency shifts .",
    "it might also be important to account carefully for the contribution of van der waals molecule formation to the contact frequency shifts .",
    "finally , we remark that a two species maser using @xmath20he and @xmath21ne has been proposed for a high precision test of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) @xcite , in which rb - noble gas contact shifts would be an important systematic effect . adding a co -",
    "located @xmath115xe maser would provide a high precision _ in situ _ measurement of the rb magnetization . with part - in-@xmath30 knowledge of the enhancement factors ,",
    "the systematic effects of contact shifts on a search for lli violation could be rendered negligible with the use of the @xmath115xe maser `` co - polarimeter '' .",
