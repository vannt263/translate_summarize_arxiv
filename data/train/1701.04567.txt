    "both in nature and in industrial applications , one regularly finds small inertial particles embedded in turbulent flows . by small inertial particles , we mean particles that are smaller than the smallest scales of the turbulence and have significantly higher material density than the fluid . for such particles , there will be momentum exchange between the particles and the turbulent fluid , and , depending on the conditions , there may also be heat and mass transfer .",
    "this is particularly so for chemically reacting particles , but there are also a large number of other applications where heat and mass transfer between particles and fluid are important . here",
    ", the main focus will be on reacting particles that consume one or more of the species in the embedding gas through surface reactions .",
    "relevant examples are ; chemical reactions on the surface of a catalytic particle , fuel oxidation on the surface of a oxygen carrying particle in a chemical looping combustion ( clc ) reactor , condensation of water vapor on cloud droplets and combustion or gasification of char .",
    "the presence of turbulence in a fluid will enhance the transport properties of the flow .",
    "this means that the mean - field viscosity , diffusivity and conductivity may be drastically increased from their laminar values .",
    "this effect has been studied for many years , and a large number of different models exist in the literature , such as the k-@xmath0 model ( @xcite ) and different versions of the reynolds stress models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence may also modify gas phase combustion , and even though this is somewhat more complicated , a significant number of models have been developed during the last decades .",
    "some examples are the eddy dissipation model ( @xcite ) , the eddy dissipation concept ( @xcite ) and variations of probability density function ( e.g. @xcite ) models .    with the above knowledge in mind , it is interesting to realize that , except for the recent work of @xcite , there is currently no model describing the effect of turbulence on the heat and mass transfer of small inertial particles .",
    "when a reacting particle is embedded in a turbulent flow , the turbulence can potentially influence the mass transfer , and hence the surface reaction rates in two ways .",
    "the first way is through particle clustering , where particles form dense clusters due to turbulence , and where the gas phase reactants within the cluster are quickly consumed while there are no particles that can consume the reactants in the particle voids outside the clusters .",
    "the main effect of the clustering is to _ decrease _ the overall mass transfer rate . the second way turbulence influence the mass transfer rate is by increasing the mean velocity difference between the particle and the gas .",
    "this effect will _ increase _ the mass transfer rate .",
    "the same two effects are also active for the heat transfer .",
    "the similarity between heat and mass transfer can be seen by considering the expressions for the transfer coefficients of mass [ kappa ] = and heat _ th= , where @xmath1 is the particle radius , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the sherwood and nusselt numbers and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mass and thermal diffusivities . for single spherical particles in flows with low and medium particle reynolds numbers ,",
    "the sherwood and nusselt numbers can be approximated by the empirical expressions of @xcite [ sherwood ] _",
    "rm&=&2 + 0.69_p^1/2 ^ 1/3 + _ rm&=&2 + 0.69_p^1/2 ^ 1/3 .    a well known example where reacting particles are consumed in a turbulent fluid is the case of pulverized coal combustion , where turbulence influences the process in several ways that are understood to varying degrees .",
    "the combustion of coal can be divided into four separate processes ; 1 ) drying , 2 ) devolatilization , 3 ) combustion of volatiles and 4 ) burnout of the remaining char .",
    "processes 1 and 2 involve the evaporation of fluids and thermal cracking of hydrocarbons , while process 3 involves homogeneous reactions . in process 4",
    ", gas phase species diffuse to the particle surface and react with the solid carbon .",
    "this happens via adsorption of e.g. an oxygen radical to a carbon site on the particle surface and a subsequent desorption of carbon monoxide into the gas phase .",
    "this makes process 4 dominated by heterogeneous chemical reactions .",
    "many published studies utilize rans based simulation tools that describe simulations of pulverized coal conversion in the form of combustion or gasification with an eulerian - eulerian approach ( @xcite and @xcite ) or a lagrangian - eulerian approach ( @xcite ) . however , none of these papers take the effect of turbulence on the heterogeneous char reactions into account . to the knowledge of the authors ,",
    "the only studies where account is made for this effect are the papers of @xcite and @xcite where the direct numerical simulations ( dns ) approach is used . in a dns ,",
    "all turbulence scales are explicitly resolved on the computational grid , such that the effect of turbulence is implicitly accounted for .",
    "however , the dns approach is extremely costly and can therefore only be used for small simulation domains . for simulations of large scale applications , the rans or les based simulation tools",
    "will therefore be the only applicable tools for the foreseeable future .    in the current paper ,",
    "the same framework as was developed by @xcite has been used and extended .",
    "the aim of the paper is to identify the effect of turbulence on the mass and heat transfer of solid particles , and to develop models that describe this effect for all damkhler numbers .",
    "in the current work , the so called point - particle direct numerical simulation ( pp - dns ) approach is used . here , the turbulent fluid itself",
    "is solved with the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) methodology , where all turbulent scales are resolved and no modelling is needed . the particles are however not resolved , but rather treated as point particles where the fluid - particle momentum , mass and heat interactions are modelled . the point particle approach is a simplification that relies heavily on the quality of the models . the alternative approach , which is to resolve the particles and their boundary layer , is extremely cpu intensive and can currently not be done for more than a few hundred particles , even on the largest computers ( @xcite ) .    a number of simplifications are made in this paper .",
    "this has been done in order to make the simulations less cpu intensive , and , even more importantly , to isolate the dominating physical mechanisms .",
    "the particles are considered to be ever lasting , i.e. they are not consumed .",
    "the reaction on the particle surface is converting reactant a to product b ; ab isothermally , i.e. ; there is no production or consumption of heat , such that only the mass transfer effect is considered .",
    "as explained above , the effect on the heat transfer rate will be similar to the effect on the mass transfer rate .",

    "the last term in , @xmath20 , is the sink term due to the gas - solid reactions on the surface of the solid particles .",

    "let us now model the reactive term .",
    "we assume that the reactions are limited to the surface of the particles and that the reactions are diffusion controlled , i.e. that all reactant that reaches the particle surface is consumed immediately .",

    "on the other hand , if the particle number density is low , the particle clusters will not have enough time to consume a significant fraction of the reactant during the life - time of the cluster , and hence , the reactant concentration will be roughly the same inside as it is outside the clusters . by assuming that the life - time of the clusters is of the order of the turbulent time scale ,",

    "the eddies in regime three will see the particles as heavy bullets that move in straight lines , without being affected by the motion of the eddies .",
    "hence , the velocity of these eddies will contribute to the relative particle - fluid velocity .",
    "the second regime is now defined as the relatively thin band in - between regimes one and three , where @xmath59 .",
    "these are the eddies that are responsible for particle clustering , since they are able to accelerate the particles to a level where they are thrown out of the eddy due to their inertia . in the following",
    ", we will refer to a typical eddy in regime two as a _",
    "resonant eddy _ , and we define the scale of this eddy as @xmath60 .",
    "the resonant eddies are identified by their time scale , @xmath61 , which is of the order of the particle response time , @xmath62 . for convenience",
    ", we set the two time scales equal , such that [ res_time ] _",

    "it is clear that the largest turbulent eddies that yield a relative velocity between the fluid and the particles , are the resonant eddies . by assuming kolmogorov scaling , the velocity of the resonant eddies is known to be @xmath63 , which can be combined with the above expression for the time scales to yield [ kl ] k_=k_l^-3/2 when the particle stokes number is defined as = and @xmath64 and @xmath65",

    "since all scales smaller than @xmath60 will induce a relative velocity between the particles and the fluid , it is reasonable to assume that the relative velocity between the fluid and the particles will be a certain fraction @xmath67 of the integrated turbulent velocity @xmath68 of all scales smaller than @xmath60 , such that [ urel0 ] u_rel=_when @xmath68 is defined as [ utilde ] _ ^2=_k_^k _ e(k)dk and @xmath69 is the wave - number of the kolmogorov scale ( @xmath70 ) , where @xmath0 is the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy .",

    "the unknown constant in this equation , @xmath67 , can be determined numerically from , i.e. @xmath73 . here , @xmath52 is found directly from dns simulations , while @xmath68 is calculated from .",
    "it is seen from that @xmath67 is close to 0.41 for most stokes and reynolds numbers .",
    "the main exception is for low reynolds and stokes numbers , where @xmath67 is significantly larger .",
    "this can be understood by inspecting the left panel of , where it is seen that for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we are already far into the dissipative subrange , where our model is not expected to be correct since it relies on a kolmogorov scaling .",
    "it is surprising to see that reproduces the relative particle velocity for such low stokes numbers , even for the smaller reynolds numbers .",
    "this may be explained by reconsidering , where we assumed that the resonant eddies correspond to the eddies that have _ exactly _ the same turnover time as the response time of the particles .",
    "this is just an order of magnitude estimate , and a more correct expression would probably be [ res_time2 ] _ = _ p , where @xmath76 is of the order of unity .",
    "more work should , however , be devoted to understanding the coupling between the particles and the turbulent eddies .",

    "the typical size of the clusters @xmath60 is assumed to be the size of the resonant eddies . from this",
    "yields a cluster size of [ ll ] l = l^3/2 .",
    "it can be seen from that the particle number density distribution does indeed show more small scale variation for the smaller stokes numbers .",
    "this has been quantified in where the power spectrum of the particle number density is shown . here",
    "we see that the spectrum peaks at large scales for @xmath79 while the peak is located at much smaller scales for smaller stokes numbers .",
    "the peak in the spectrum does not , however , follow as accurately as expected .",
    "the reason for this is most likely that power spectra are not the right diagnostics to study the size of particle clusters , but it may also be partly because of : 1 ) poor statistics due to too few particles ( the smaller clusters are not filled with particles ) , 2 ) the constant in the definition of the resonant eddies not being unity ( see e.g. ) , or 3 ) finite reynolds number effects .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath10 can be integrated to yield a measure of the strength in the particle number density fluctuations , given by the root - mean - square ( rms ) particle number density ; n_rms = p dk .",

    "the values of @xmath41 are found in .",
    "the value of @xmath85 for small numbers equals the sherwood number divided by two , while the number for which @xmath85 starts to decrease is determined by the cluster decay rate @xmath41 .",
    "overall , the model seems to follow the results from the dns simulations rather well .    from it",
    "can be seen that for large stokes numbers , the curves for the normalized decay rates of a given stokes number overlap for different reynolds numbers if the reynolds number is high enough .",
    "this is because the resonant eddies are at scales larger than the dissipative subrange .",
    "so increasing the reynolds number , which may be considered a shift of the dissipative subrange to smaller scales , is not affecting the resonant eddies , and hence also the clustering is unaffected . if , however , the reynolds or the stokes number is small , such that the resonant eddies are in the dissipative subrange , a change in reynolds number will have an effect on the normalized decay rate ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha_st ] shows that by decreasing the stokes number , the normalized reactant decay rate stays unchanged up to larger numbers .",
    "this means that the effect of particle clustering is weaker for smaller stokes numbers .",
    "this is expected since the limit of very small clusters corresponds to individual particles , where @xmath85 is independent of @xmath86 .",
    "from the simulations with small numbers and @xmath84 , which are shown in the right panel of , it can be observed that the normalized decay rate is monotonically decreasing with stokes number .",
    "the reason for this is that for these simulations the particle size is kept constant as the stokes number is changed , such that the sherwood number is decreased with decreasing stokes number .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the simulations with @xmath87 , where it is found that the normalized decay rate for small numbers is lower for @xmath81 than for @xmath82 .",
    "the reason for this is that a smaller particle radius was used for the simulations with @xmath81 .",
    "the effect of reducing the particle radius is that the particle reynolds number , and hence also the sherwood number , is decreased .",
    "if the chemical time scale is much shorter than the lifetime of the particle clusters , the interior of the clusters will quickly be void of reactants .",
    "this means that the reactant consumption rate is controlled by the flux of reactant to the surface of the clusters , where the reactant will be consumed at the exterior of the cluster .",
    "based on this , it is clear that for large @xmath86 ( small @xmath88 ) , the clusters behave as large solid particles , or super - particles .",
    "following @xcite , the reactant decay rate is then given by the so called cluster decay rate ; _ c = n_c_ca_c when @xmath89 is the number density of clusters ( or super - particles ) , @xmath90 is the reactant diffusion rate to the super - particles , @xmath91 is the surface area of the clusters , @xmath92 is the turbulent diffusivity that carries the reactant from the surrounding fluid to the surface of the clusters and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are constants that depend on the dimensionality of the clusters .",
    "it is clear that turbulent eddies larger than @xmath60 , as given by , can not participate in the turbulent transport of reactants to the clusters , while eddies slightly smaller than @xmath60 will participate .",
    "a first approximation of the turbulent diffusivity to the surface of the clusters is therefore given by d_t = u_l = u_ll^2 . by combining the above , taking into account , it can be found that = a_1a_2 , where the right hand side should be constant for resonant eddies well inside the inertial range .     as a function of @xmath78 for runs with resonant eddies in the inertial range . ]    from , it can be seen that the right hand side of the above equation is constant only for stokes numbers smaller than @xmath95 .",
    "since the value of the right hand side starts to increase already for @xmath81 , this may once again indicate that @xmath76 from is different from unity .",
    "the discrepancy may also be due to the fact that when it comes to the shape of the particle clusters , a large scale strain may stretch the particle clusters . for @xmath96 , there are no vortices that are larger than the clusters , and hence the dimensionality of the clusters becomes different .",
    "this will inevitably yield different values of @xmath97 .",
    "the value of the geometric coefficients can be fitted by a_1a_2=0.08 + /3 , but this is just an empirical fit and more work is required in order to understand the fundamentals behind the shape and size of the particle clusters .",
    "in this work , the effect of turbulence on the mass ( and heat ) transfer between inertial particles and the embedding fluid is studied .",
    "the turbulence is shown to have two effects on the mass transfer .",
    "the first effect is active for all numbers , and here the turbulence increases the mass transfer rate due to the relative velocity between the particles in the fluid . a corresponding model for the relative velocity between the fluid and the particles",
    "is given by which uses basic variables of the flow .",
    "with this , adding effects of relative velocity into rans based simulations is possible .    the second effect with which turbulence influences the mass transfer rate is through the clustering of particles .",
    "it is shown that the size of the particle clusters increases with the particle stokes number , and that the clustering decreases the overall mass transfer rate between the particles and the fluid .",
    "this is a confirmation of the findings of @xcite .",
    "in addition , a model is developed that takes this effect into account and incorporates it into a modified sherwood number .",
    "this model is shown to give reasonable results for stokes numbers ( based on the turbulent integral scale ) less than @xmath98 , while an empirical fit is employed to account for stokes numbers up to unity .",
    "more work is still required in order to fully understand the size and dimensionality of the the particle clusters . as of now ,",

    "<S> two effects are identified . </S>",
    "<S> the first effect is due to the relative velocity between the fluid and the particles , and a model for the relative velocity is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the second effect is due to the clustering of particles , where the mass transfer rate is inhibited due to the rapid depletion of the consumed species inside the dense particle clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this last effect is relevant for large numbers and it may totally control the mass transfer rate for numbers larger than unity . a model that describes how this effect should be incorporated into existing particle simulation tools is presented .    reacting multiphase flow , particle / fluid flow , combustion , turbulent reacting flows , turbulence simulations </S>"
