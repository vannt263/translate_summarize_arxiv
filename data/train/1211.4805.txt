    "one of the essential features of quantum mechanics is entanglement , which is a well known resource for quantum computation and communication tasks @xcite .",
    "however , it is increasingly become clear that certain kinds of separable states , with vanishing entanglement , exhibit some type of quantum correlation which turns out to be useful in information processing tasks .",
    "for example it has been shown @xcite that it can be helpful in mixed state quantum computation @xcite , local broadcasting @xcite , quantum state merging @xcite , quantum communication @xcite and quantum state discrimination @xcite .",
    "different measures have been introduced to quantify this kind of correlation @xcite .",
    "an interesting features of this kind of correlation is that it can be produced by local actions on classically correlated states @xcite .",
    "the capability of creating this kind of correlation by unitary transformation @xcite and its behavior under dissipation is studied @xcite . + as an example which has no kind of quantum correlation , consider the following separable state : @xmath0 in which , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthogonal bases for each part , @xmath3s are non - negative and @xmath4 .",
    "the states @xmath5s are completely distinguishable in party a and the same holds for the states @xmath6s in party b. such states are known as classical - classical ( cc ) , or classically correlated states @xcite .",
    "another class of separable states are of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8s are arbitrary pure or mixed but non - orthogonal density matrices . in these states , called quantum - classical , the states in party @xmath9 are not necessarily distinguishable and this quantumness feature shows itself in the correlations between parts of this composite system",
    ". +   + states with quantum correlations of the form ( [ qcstates ] ) can be obtained from classically correlated states in ( [ ccstates ] ) by local noisy channels which are described by cpt ( completely positive trace preserving ) maps .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a local channel can produce quantum correlations on a cc state provided that the channel is neither unital nor semi - classical .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for local creation of quantum correlations is that it is not a commutativity - preserving channel @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the maximum amount of quantum correlations that can be created by the channel from a classically correlated state has been found , using discord as a measure of quantum correlations .",
    "+   + as it is shown in @xcite local channels which are not unital or semi - classical can produce quantum correlations , on suitable initial states .",
    "it is then natural to ask how much quantum correlations a general local channel can produce , when it acts on a classically correlated state .",
    "clearly this question has operational and experimental significance .",
    "the amount of quantum correlations produced , depends not only on the local noise , but also on the initial classically correlated state .",
    "here we find the amount of quantum correlations that a given channel can produce on an arbitrary classically correlated state .",
    "furthermore , we find the average performance of a channel by averaging the amount of correlation which it creates on all classically correlated input states . to this end , we introduce a computable measure for quantum correlations and justify it in several ways . in particular for a subset of qc states ( [ qcstates ] ) in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary pure states , we do perform an analytical optimization to obtain a closed form for the geometric measure of correlations introduced in @xcite and show that our measure is monotonic with the geometric measure . although this measure can only be used to quantify the amount of correlations in the sates of form ( [ qcstates ] ) , the advantage of it is that no optimization is required for calculating it .",
    "+   + the structure of the paper , is as follows . in section ( [ sec2 ] )",
    "we introduce a simple measure for classical correlations of bi - partite qubit systems and remind the readers of the conditions under which @xcite , a local channel can or can not create quantum correlations in such states . in section ( [ sec3 ] ) , we recapitulate what is known about qubit channels and add some new results on characterization of semi - classical qubit channels and their relation with unital channels . in section ( [ sec4 ] ) , a computable measure for quantifying the correlations in quantum - classical states , is introduced , where its properties are studied in detail . in section ( [ sec5 ] )",
    "the performance of a general qubit channel for producing quantum correlations is discussed and its correlating power is calculated .",
    "section ( [ sec6 ] ) is devoted to some explicit examples including amplitude damping channel . finally in section ( [ sec7 ] ) , we derive a closed expression for geometrical measure of quantumness for a subclass of qc states ( [ qcstates ] ) in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary pure states , and compare it with our measure .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "when the states in possession of the two parties , belong to two - level systems or qubits , many of the considerations , i.e. quantifying the classical and quantum correlations and also the characterization of quantum channels greatly simplify and pave the way for analytical treatments .",
    "in particular , as we will show , one can introduce computable measures for quantum correlations .",
    "+ let us start with a cc state as in ( [ ccstates ] ) .",
    "for the two - level case this state is written explicitly as [ cc2 ] = p_00|u_0u_0||v_0v_0| + p_01|u_0u_0||v_1v_1| + p_10|u_1u_1||v_0v_0| + p_11|u_1u_1||v_1v_1| .",
    "we define its measure of classical correlations by the following quantity : @xmath12 in this way an uncorrelated state ( i.e. a product state ) for which @xmath13 has zero measure of correlations and a state with maximal classical correlations , has @xmath14 .",
    "an example of such a state is given by @xmath15 the states in possession of party a , are not identical or orthogonal , the shared state between the two parties , although being separable and having no entanglement , is known to exhibit some degree of non - classical correlations .",
    "an example of this kind of state is @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "indeed various measures for determining the amount of quantum correlations in these states have been proposed in the literature @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ an interesting question which has recently been investigated @xcite is whether one of the parties , say alice , can generate quantum correlations by performing a general quantum channel @xmath18 on her qubit .",
    "in such a case , the resulting state is @xmath19 this question was first posed in @xcite where it was proved that for qubits , this is not possible if the channel @xmath18 is unital or semi - classical ( see the next section for their definition ) .",
    "+ in view of these results , a natural question is how much a general non - unital channel is effective in creating quantum correlations starting from a classically correlated state . clearly this question has operational and experimental significance . by local operation and classical communication alice and bob can prepare a classically correlated state of the form ( [ ccstates ] ) .",
    "then alice can perform a quantum channel on her qubit to turn the classically correlated state into a state with some degree of quantum correlations .",
    "one can then ask that given a fixed input state , what kind of channel alice should use to create the highest amount of correlations . or one can ask : given a fixed quantum channel , what kind of classically correlated input state , create the largest amount of quantum correlations . +    [ map ]",
    "in this section we remind the reader of a few basic facts about qubit channels .",
    "we also discuss the characterization of unital and semi - classical channels and their relations with each other .",
    "it is well known that a qubit channel @xmath18 induces an affine transformation on the bloch sphere , @xmath20 .",
    "a qubit channel can always be decomposed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unitary channels and @xmath24 is the canonical form of the channel .",
    "in other words , for every channel @xmath18 , one can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a canonical channel whose action on the bloch vectors is given by @xmath27 , in which @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are rotations in bloch sphere induced by the unitary operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "a unital channel is one for which @xmath33 and a semi - classical channel is such its action on any input state can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a fixed othrogonal set independent of the state @xmath36 .",
    "unital and semi - classical channels can be characterized in a simple way and for qubits , at least for qubit channels . for unital channels",
    "@xmath37 . to characterize semi - classical qubit channels , let the fixed bases of the channel be as @xmath38",
    ". then we have @xmath39 where in the second line we have written @xmath40 to stress the dependence of @xmath41 on the bloch vector @xmath42 of the state @xmath36 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath43 should be convex - linear , we find that @xmath41 should be affine transformations on @xmath42 and hence , without loss of generality , they can be parameterized as @xmath44 where we have used the fact that @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are a real vector and a real number respectively .",
    "putting all this together , we find @xmath48 which means that the affine transformation induced by a semi - classical channel is given by @xmath49 this means that semi - classical channels are parameterized by @xmath50 parameters , pertaining to the real number @xmath47 and the two vectors @xmath46 and @xmath51 .",
    "[ bloch ]     [ semiclassicalfigure ]   which is unital but not semi - classical , has @xmath37 , its @xmath52 is not a product state .",
    "the channel @xmath53 has @xmath54 and its @xmath52 is a product state .",
    "the channel channel @xmath55 , which is semi - classical but not unital , has its @xmath52 a product , but its @xmath56 is non - zero . finally the channel @xmath57 has a non - zero @xmath58 and its @xmath52 is not a product state . only these types of channels which are neither unital nor semi - classical can create quantum correlations.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=226 ]    these considerations teach us how to characterize semi - classical and non - semi - classical qubit channels .",
    "a channel is non - semi - classical if @xmath59 , i.e. either when @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 or when @xmath63 as a tensor can not be decomposed into the product of two vectors .",
    "in fact we note from ( [ characterizesemiclassical ] ) that @xmath64 .",
    "that is , @xmath65 as a tensor is a product of @xmath66 and another vector . in other words , if we vectorize the matrix @xmath65 as @xmath67 , then a qubit channel is semi - classical when its @xmath52 is as follows @xmath68 that is , if @xmath69 is a product state .",
    "otherwise it is a non - semi - classical channel .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows , the actions of unital and semi - classical channels on the bloch vector and figure ( [ semiclassicalfigure ] ) shows the relation between these two classes of channels . +",
    "one can quantify the quantum correlations in a given bi - partite state @xmath36 in various ways , for example by using a measure based on distance .",
    "one such measure is @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the set of all classically correlated states .",
    "however such measures are not easy to calculate , specially when we note that the set of classically correlated is not convex . for our purpose ,",
    "i.e. for calculating the power of an arbitrary quantum channel for generating quantum correlations , we need a simple measure which has a simple analytic expression and yet , it retains many of the properties that other measures of quantum correlations have .",
    "we introduce this measure and then will explain its properties later on . as for the measure ( [ goq ] ) , in section ( [ sec7 ] ) ,",
    "we derive a closed analytical expression for an important subclass and show that it qualitatively agrees with our measure for this subclass .",
    "+ consider a state of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are two positive operators on the qubit space .",
    "we define the degree of quantum correlations of this state to be given by @xmath75\\|_1\\ ] ] where @xmath76=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath77 is the trace - norm given by @xmath78 .",
    "it is based on the fact that when @xmath79=0 $ ] , then they can be diagonalized in the same basis and hence the state is obviously classically correlated",
    ". indeed if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two density matrices , and @xmath82 then our measure gives , after a simple calculation @xmath83 this gives a value @xmath84 for states of the form ( [ cmax1 ] ) and a value @xmath85 for the state ( [ qmax ] ) .",
    "+ besides its simplicity , this measure has many interesting properties which we now explain .",
    "obviously it vanishes for classically correlated states and gives the maximum value of unity for states of the form ( [ qmax ] ) .",
    "consider now a general classically correlated state as = p_00|*n*||00| + p_01|*n*||11| + p_10|-*n*-*n*||00| + p_11|-*n*-*n*||11| .",
    "let alice acts on her qubit by a general quantum channel . from @xmath86 the resulting bi - partite state",
    "will then be given by @xmath87 where @xmath88\\\\ x_1&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(p_{01}+p_{11})(i+{\\bf t}\\cdot \\sigma)+(p_{01}-p_{11 } ) \\lambda { \\bf n}\\cdot    \\sigma\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore using ( [ qakm ] ) we find that @xmath89\\|_1=|4(p_{00}p_{11}-p_{01}p_{10})|\\times 2|{\\bf    t}\\times \\lambda { \\bf n}|=2|{\\bf    t}\\times \\lambda { \\bf n}|c(\\sigma).\\ ] ] this result says that the amount of quantum correlations produced is directly proportional to the amount of classical correlations already present , in the form @xmath90 .",
    "therefore no quantum correlations is created when the initial state has no classical correlations and the maximum quantum correlations is created only when the initial state has maximum classical correlations .",
    "moreover for a unital channel ( for which @xmath91 or a semiclassical channel ( for which @xmath92 , see ( [ characterizesemiclassical ] ) ) no quantum correlations is created .",
    "+ henceforth we take all input states to be of the form ( [ cmax1 ] ) , for which we have @xmath93 it is also proportional to degree of non - unitality of the quantum channel , measured by the magnitude of the vector @xmath94 . as a second merit of our measure , we show that unital channels , not only can not create quantum correlations , they can not increase the amount of quantum correlations for an arbitrary input state , which may happen to have some degree of quantum correlations .",
    "that is we show that for any quantum - classical ( qc ) input state @xmath36 , and any unital channel @xmath95 @xmath96 to prove this consider a qc state of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath10 do not necessary commute . in other words , @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are not necessarily co - linear or unit vectors .",
    "a unital channel acting on this state will produce @xmath102 where @xmath103 the quantum correlations of the new state , measured by ( [ qakm ] ) is given by @xmath104\\| = 4 p_0p_1 |\\lambda { \\bf r}_0\\times \\lambda { \\bf    r}_1|.\\ ] ] however we know from the classification of qubit channels @xcite , that @xmath105 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two orthogonal matrices which do the singular value decomposition of @xmath65 and @xmath106 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath107 . using the orthogonality of @xmath29 , we find that @xmath108 using the conditions on the values of @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath107 , we find that @xmath110 and again using the orthogonality of @xmath30 , we find that this is less than or equal to @xmath111 .",
    "therefore we have proved that @xmath112",
    "let @xmath18 be a completely positive trace - preserving map acting on a qubit .",
    "we ask how much power this quantum channel has for creating quantum correlations , when it acts on maximally classically correlated states .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the amount of correlations produced , depends on the initial state .",
    "moreover as shown in ( [ amountofq ] ) , it is directly proportional to the amount of classical correlations already present in the state .",
    "therefore to compute the power of a quantum channel , the best to do is to average over all the possible input states of the form ( [ cmax1 ] ) which have maximal classical correlations and then see how much quantum correlations on the average , a given channel @xmath18 can produce when alice enacts it on her state .",
    "+ therefore we define the power of the channel as follows : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an invariant measure over the bloch sphere .",

    "this is again an interesting property of the measure ( [ qakm ] ) which is not clear to hold for other kinds of measures , which are based on optimization , like the geometric measure in @xcite . to do this",

    "in this section , we study the correlations created by a few non - unital and non - semi - classical channels .",
    "this channel describes the leakage of a photon in a cavity to an environment which has no photon , and is described by the kraus operators @xmath128 the parameters of the corresponding affine transforamtion are give by @xmath129 from ( [ power ] ) we find after a simple integration @xmath130 obviously when @xmath131 , no correlations can be produced . in the other extreme , when @xmath132 , the channel maps every state to @xmath122 and again no correlations can be produced . channels for which @xmath133 have the highest correlating power equal to @xmath134 .",
    "figure ( 4 ) shows the correlating power of amplitude damping channel as a function of @xmath135 based on two different measures .",
    "+ it is intriguing that a channel which is dissipative in nature can create correlations , although its correlating power is small , see the other examples .",
    "[ ad ]       another interesting class of non - unital channels is adaptive preparation of states , depending on the outcome of a projective measurement .",
    "let alice measures her qubit in the basis @xmath136 . in case",
    "her outcome is @xmath137 , she replaces her qubit with @xmath138 and in case her outcome is @xmath139 , she replaces her qubit with @xmath140 , where @xmath138 and @xmath140 are two non - orthogonal pure states .",
    "such a channel can be described as @xmath141 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 . to find the correlating power of this channel , according to ( [ power ] ) , we have to find the affine transformation corresponding to this channel . to do this we note that @xmath144 writing the pure states in terms of their bloch representation , namely i.e. @xmath145 and @xmath146 we find that @xmath147 therefore we find the quantum correlations in the resulting state to be @xmath148 thus the quantum correlations is maximized when @xmath149 and when @xmath150 .",
    "this means that to create maximum correlations , alice should measure her qubit in the same basis as present in the initial state and she should also prepare the corresponding states to have orthogonal vectors on the bloch sphere , i.e. @xmath151 and @xmath152 . from ( [ power ] ) , the correlating power of this channel turns out to be @xmath153      consider a non - semi - classical channel @xmath18 with @xmath154 and @xmath60 , with @xmath62 .",
    "when acting on a maximally classically correlated state , the resulting state has a quantum correlations given by @xmath155 and the power of the channel will be given by @xmath156 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the correlating power of channels in general . in view of equation ( [ theorem ] ) , we need only consider the canonical form of channels for which @xmath157 is diagonal .",
    "every such channel is described by @xmath158 parameters , @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "first we note from ( [ nonunitality ] ) , that for a fixed channel the best initial state is when @xmath161 . in this case",
    ", @xmath162 reduces to @xmath163 and from this we find the best choice of @xmath164 is that @xmath164 be parallel to @xmath165 . putting all this together we find from ( [ nonunitality ] ) that the maximum correlations this channel can produce is given by @xmath166 the correlating power of a general abstract channel is given by the integral ( [ average ] ) .",
    "we have based our discussion on a simple and easily computable measure of quantum correlations , introduced in ( [ qakm ] ) .",
    "it is desirable to compare this measure with the geometric measure ( [ goq ] ) , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the point is that the later measure needs an optimization which does not necessarily lead to a closed analytical form .",
    "however in this section we derive a closed expression for the geometric measure of quantum correlations , for a class of states in the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are two arbitrary pure states .",
    "the results in this section , which are a byproduct of our investigations on this problem , can indeed be read independently from the rest of the paper .",
    "in fact these results have their own interest , since both the question we pose and also the method of analysis which is based on an analytic optimization problem , are interesting in their own right .",
