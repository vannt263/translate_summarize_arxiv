    "in a recent publication @xcite we have developed a theoretical model to study simultaneously pion- and photon - induced production of eta- and k - mesons from protons , based on our previous work in ref.@xcite .",
    "in contrast to most other approaches @xcite we do not introduce explicit ( baryonic or mesonic ) resonances .",
    "our starting point is the su(3 ) chiral effective lagrangian for the octet baryons ( @xmath7 ) and the octet pseudoscalar goldstone bosons ( @xmath8 ) with interactions controlled by chiral symmetry and a low - momentum expansion . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have identified the s - wave meson - baryon amplitudes generated by the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian with a coupled channel potential matrix which is iterated to infinite order in a separable lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space .",
    "the resulting multi - channel s - matrix is automatically unitary , and one naturally obtains cusp effects at secondary thresholds ( e.g. at the @xmath9-threshold for reactions with @xmath10-final states ) .",
    "furthermore , strong attraction is predicted by the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian in certain s - wave channels , namely @xmath11 with total isospin 0 and @xmath9 with total isospin 1/2 . as a consequence ,",
    "quasi - bound s - wave meson - baryon states emerge in the coupled channel scheme .",
    "in fact these states possess all the properties attributed to the baryon resonances @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in particular the unstable @xmath9-bound state has a large branching ratio for decaying into @xmath14 which is the outstanding feature of the nucleon resonance @xmath13 .",
    "remaining adjustable parameters ( a priori unknown coefficients in the lagrangian and short range cut - offs in the separable lippmann - schwinger equation ) are fixed in a simultaneous fit to a large amount of low energy data .",
    "these include the total cross sections for elastic and inelastic @xmath15-scattering ( @xmath16 ) as well as the total cross sections for pion- and photon - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . among these data",
    "the most precise ones are those for @xmath19 measured at mami @xcite .",
    "one finds that the combined mami / elsa @xmath0-photoproduction total cross sections @xcite can be well reproduced in s - wave approximation . on the other hand , for the kaon photoproduction channels @xmath20 measured at elsa @xcite , the s - wave approximation works only in the near threshold region . at higher energies s - waves alone considerably underestimate the total cross sections and evidently p - waves start to become important",
    "this is also seen from the angular distributions of the differential cross section which are no longer isotropic at these energies .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath21- and @xmath22-recoil polarizations measured at elsa @xcite ( via the self - analyzing weak decay of these hyperons ) can result only from s- and p - wave interference terms . also , existing differential cross sections for pion - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production point toward the importance of the meson - baryon p - wave amplitudes .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend our previous coupled channel framework @xcite by including , in a systematic manner , the strong interaction @xmath23- and @xmath24-partial wave amplitudes together with the photoproduction p - wave multipoles ( @xmath25 . the latter correspond to the electric quadrupole transition ( @xmath26 ) and the magnetic dipole transitions ( @xmath27 ) in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction . in complete analogy with the treatment of the s - waves in ref.@xcite we will identify the ( strong and electromagnetic ) p - wave multipoles given by the first and second order su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian with a coupled channel potential .",
    "this matrix of driving terms is iterated to infinite orders in a separable ( p - wave ) lippmann - schwinger equation using the same values of the short range cut - offs as for the s - waves . for the strong meson - baryon interaction",
    "seven new parameters come along with four spin - non - flip terms and three spin - flip terms at next - to - leading order .",
    "a very welcome feature of our approach is that the inclusion of the electromagnetic interaction ( @xmath0 and @xmath1-photoproduction ) is completely parameterfree .",
    "the respective p - wave multipoles ( @xmath28 depend only on well known baryon magnetic moments and the su(3 ) axial vector coupling constant @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is then quite non - trivial to achieve a good description of so many empirical photon- and pion - induced data within a coupled channel approach , based on a single chiral effective lagrangian , in which all these processes are correlated .    in this paper",
    "we do not aim for an accurate reproduction of elastic @xmath31-phase shifts .",
    "this is a drawback of the present approach which could be fixed by parametrizing the relevant @xmath32-amplitudes .",
    "our goal here is rather to focus on the impact of chiral @xmath33 on hadron dynamics involving kaons and @xmath0-mesons .",
    "the more detailed influence of the elastic @xmath32-channel will be investigated at a later stage .",
    "on the experimental side there are now improved data ( total and differential cross sections and hyperon recoil polarizations ) for kaon photoproduction from elsa @xcite . in the case of @xmath0-photoproduction",
    "the polarized photon asymmetry has recently been measured at graal @xcite , and the polarized target asymmetry was measured at elsa @xcite . at brookhaven",
    "there is an ongoing program @xcite to measure @xmath34 and related reactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the formalism to calculate the strong and electromagnetic p - wave amplitudes within our approach .",
    "we first display the relevant p - wave part of the su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian at second order , derive expressions for the strong p - wave potentials and formulate the separable p - wave lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "next we apply the same formalism to @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction and give expressions for the observables ( total and differential cross sections as well as the polarized target asymmetry , the recoil polarization and the polarized photon asymmetry ) in s- and p - wave approximation . in section 3",
    "we discuss in detail our results for pion- and photon - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson production off protons , and we conclude in section 4 with a summary .",
    "the leading order relativistic su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian and the s - wave part at next - to - leading order have already been developed and explained in detail in section 2.1 of ref.@xcite .",

    "further possible su(3)-symmetric p - wave interaction terms at this order can be expressed through the ones given in eq.(1 ) using non - trivial trace relations @xcite .",
    "when computing the photoproduction p - wave multipoles at a later stage , we will need the photon - baryon vertex at next - to - leading order , i.e. the terms proportional to baryon anomalous magnetic moments . in su(3 )",

    "the baryon anomalous magnetic moments are related to the two constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq.(2 ) as follows , @xmath53 however , as the empirical values given in eq.(3 ) indicate , there are significant deviations from the simple su(3)-relations .",
    "to be more accurate at this point , we will actually use the empirical values of the baryon anomalous magnetic moments inasmuch as they are available .",
    "the empirically unknown @xmath54 and the sign of the transition magnetic moment @xmath55 are taken in eq.(3 ) from the recent chiral perturbation theory calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "this completes the discussion of the p - wave extension of the chiral effective lagrangian .",
    "the seven unknown parameters @xmath56 will be fixed in a fit to many scattering data in section 3 .",
    "let us now describe the coupled channel approach to the strong ( p - wave ) meson - baryon interaction .",
    "we label the meson - baryon states @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with total isospin @xmath61 and the states @xmath57 , @xmath60 with total isospin @xmath62 by an index which runs from 1 to 6 , in that order . in a specific channel the meson center - of - mass energy @xmath63",
    "is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total center - of - mass energy of the meson - baryon system and @xmath66 denote the mass of the corresponding baryon and meson .",
    "the center - of - mass momentum in channel @xmath67 reads @xmath68 and we have also given its analytical continuation below threshold ( i.e. for @xmath69 ) .",
    "because of the spin - orbit interaction there are two different p - wave amplitudes in meson - baryon scattering ( corresponding to the @xmath23- and @xmath24-states ) , and these do not mix . in both angular momentum states the different channels are coupled through a ( reduced ) p - wave potential in momentum space , @xmath70 where we have taken away the characteristic p - wave factor @xmath71 which will appear explicitly in the coupled channel equation .",
    "the relative coupling strengths @xmath72 are calculated from the chiral su(3 ) meson - baryon lagrangian at next - to - leading order .",

    "the exponent on the off - shell form factor @xmath82 ^ 4 $ ] follows from the general rule @xmath83 for given orbital angular momentum @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the resulting multi - channel p - wave s - matrix @xmath85 is exactly unitarity in the subspace of the kinematically open channels .",
    "note that in the sense of chiral ( i.e. small momentum ) counting the iterations generated by the separable lippmann - schwinger equation do not affect the leading order current - algebra results for s - waves @xcite . in the p - wave channels ,",
    "the formal chiral power counting is distorted by the short distance cut - off scale @xmath81 in eq.(7 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the @xmath86 and @xmath14 channels investigated in this work have dynamic features quite different from those familiar from near threshold @xmath32 scattering .",
    "in particular there is no primary reason to expect that leading order current - algebra results would be relevant at the much higher energy ( around 1gev ) involved in @xmath86- and @xmath14-production .",
    "the main purpose of our investigation is to explore to what extent chiral @xmath87 still plays a significant role in constraining the driving terms @xmath73 in the lippmann - schwinger equation eq.(7 ) .    in order to calculate observables for @xmath2-induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson production",

    "the corresponding polarized photon asymmetry reads in s- and p - wave approximation @xmath137 it is clear from eqs.(23,24,25 ) , that even just the signs of the polarization observables @xmath138 already contain non - trivial dynamical information .",

    "we identify @xmath150 with the octet baryon mass in the su(3 ) chiral limit ( of vanishing @xmath151- , @xmath152- and @xmath153-quark mass ) and we use @xmath154 mev as obtained in a best fit to the data .",
    "this value of @xmath150 is consistent with @xmath155 gev of ref.@xcite as found in a recent heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory calculation to order @xmath156 . the third chiral symmetry breaking parameter @xmath157",

    "such a value of @xmath157 leads to a relative scalar strangeness content in the nucleon of @xmath160 and to a pion - nucleon sigma - term of @xmath161 mev . whereas @xmath162 is compatible with the present empirical determination @xmath163 @xcite , the pion - nucleon sigma - term is somewhat too small compared to the empirical value @xmath164 mev of @xcite . as mentioned already in @xcite ,",
    "if one stays to linear order in the quark masses , as done here , then both pieces of information ( @xmath162 and @xmath165 ) can not be explained by a single value of @xmath157 .",
    "the remaining parameters are adjusted in a best fit to a large amount of pion- and photon - induced data .",
    "the four range parameters are found as @xmath166 we give here sufficiently many digits to make the numerical results reproducible .",
    "one observes that the four range parameters are rather close to the values found in @xcite where only s - wave amplitudes have been considered , and they are all located in the physically reasonable range @xmath167 gev . at the same time",
    "the coefficients of the four double - derivative s - wave terms come out as @xmath168 ( in units of gev@xmath148 ) and those of the four analogous spin - non - flip p - wave terms as @xmath169 furthermore , the coefficients of the three spin - flip p - wave terms are found as @xmath170 ( again in units of gev@xmath148 ) .",
    "note that all these coefficients are of  natural  size .",
    "one also observes that the coefficients @xmath171 do not differ much from those found in our previous work @xcite where only s - wave amplitudes have been considered .",
    "in essence , the relative weights between the total cross sections in the different hadronic channels already fix the whole pattern of s - wave amplitudes and their parameters .",
    "the addition of p - waves does not change this pattern qualitatively .",
    "we have furthermore checked that an equally good description of the @xmath172 low - energy data as in ref.@xcite can be obtained with the ( slightly modified ) s - wave parameters eq.(27 ) after readjusting the range parameters @xmath173 and @xmath174 .    before presenting results for the observables of pion- and photon - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production we like to mention some generic features of our approach .",
    "we found that the second order s- and p - wave terms ( proportional to @xmath175 ) are essential in order to obtain a good fit of the total cross sections for pion - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production .",
    "this is quite different from the case of @xmath176-proton elastic and inelastic scattering , where one can obtain a good description of the low energy data already with the leading order terms alone in the coupled channel scheme @xcite , at the expense of readjusting the pseudoscalar decay constant .",
    "furthermore , we have observed that the baryon anomalous magnetic moments @xmath177 ( collected in eq.(3 ) ) are very important in order to get a good simultaneous reproduction of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction total cross sections .",
    "setting all @xmath177 equal to zero would lead to a strong reduction of the magnetic p - wave multipoles @xmath27 for kaon - photoproduction which however turn out to be important in the energy region somewhat above threshold .",
    "we have also performed a fit taking into account the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar decay constants by setting @xmath178 mev for pions , @xmath179 mev @xcite for kaons and @xmath180 mev @xcite for the @xmath0-meson .",
    "( note that we are identifying throughout the physical @xmath0-meson with the flavor state @xmath181 . ) .",
    "we find that such su(3)-breaking effects can be balanced by a slight change of the coefficients of the second order terms and the range parameters .",
    "the fit with a single @xmath41 mev is practically indistinguishable from a fit with three different pseudoscalar decay constants .",
    "therefore we stay with a single @xmath41 mev as in our previous publications on this and related subjects .",
    "we have also performed systematic searches in which the range parameters @xmath81 ( see eq.(9 ) ) entering the p - wave amplitudes were allowed to differ from those of the s - waves .",
    "the resulting improvements were only marginal , however , so that the introduction of four more parameters did not appear justified and we stayed with the set eq.(26 ) .",
    "let us now discuss the comparison with the data in detail .",
    "note that a direct comparison of our s- and p - wave coupled channel model with elastic @xmath32-scattering in the energy range of interest here ( @xmath182gev@xmath183gev ) would not be meaningful since partial waves of much higher angular momentum and several nucleon resonances contribute in that channel .",
    "introducing @xmath32 resonances ( @xmath184 etc . )",
    "would certainly improve the situation , but at the expense of additional free parameters .",
    "in the present paper we have ignored such explicit resonance contributions as well as the coupling to the inelastic @xmath185 continuum .",
    "deficiencies of the present results for @xmath14- and @xmath86-production may point to the influence of these neglected effects and should be further explored .",
    "in fig.1 , we show our results for the total cross sections for pion - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production : @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the data are taken from the compilation @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the coupled channel calculation including s- and p - wave amplitudes with the existing data is very good , even for energies considerably above threshold ( i.e. up to @xmath188 gev ) .",
    "the contributions of the s - wave amplitude and the two p - wave amplitudes to the total cross section are shown separately for each reaction channel . with the inclusion of the p - wave one",
    "is now able to describe also the data in the ( pure isospin-3/2 ) channel @xmath4 up to @xmath189 gev . in this channel",
    "the s - wave contributes very little , as already found in our previous work @xcite , and the p - wave contribution is completely dominant .",
    "furthermore , with the inclusion of p - wave amplitudes one can describe the total cross section data for @xmath190 up to @xmath191 gev whereas the s - wave approximation starts to break down around @xmath192 gev .",
    "note that the large @xmath0-production cross section in @xmath193 near threshold ( usually interpreted in terms of the nucleon resonance @xmath13 having a large branching ratio into @xmath14 ) is still dominated by the s - wave amplitude . in the present approach a s - wave quasi - bound @xmath9-state is formed through the coupled channel dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the peak in the @xmath194 total cross section is generated by a strong s - wave cusp effect at the @xmath9-threshold as already found in our previous work @xcite . as a byproduct of this calculation we extract the complex @xmath14 scattering length @xmath195 fm .",
    "whereas its imaginary part agrees with the recent empirical determination @xmath196 fm of @xcite , its real part is about a factor two too small .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the real part re@xmath197 can not exceed 0.4 fm as long as only one @xmath198-resonance is included ( as it is the case here ) and therefore the relatively small real part is just consistent with this .",
    "altogether it is highly non - trivial to produce the pattern of relative weights of s- and p - waves as shown in fig.1 . in a coupled channel calculation",
    "all reactions get linked together and changes in one channel will immediately affect all the others .      in fig.2 we show some typical examples of angular distributions of the differential cross sections for pion - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production . for the reaction @xmath193 with data taken from @xcite one",
    "finds that the trend of the data is roughly reproduced , however , with too much deviation from isotropy . in the case",
    "@xmath199 ( data are taken from @xcite ) one finds a good reproduction of the angular distribution at low energies .",
    "however , moving up in energy the forward - backward asymmetry develops in a way opposite to the data .",
    "this means that the magnitudes of the s- and p - wave amplitudes in this channel are given correctly but their interference term has the wrong sign .",
    "the same features apply to the channel @xmath200 where the data stem from @xcite",
    ". it may be that introduction of the @xmath184-resonance coupling to @xmath10 ( and possibly to @xmath9 ) is necessary here . merely adding a @xmath184-resonance contribution to the present coupled channel amplitudes did not turn out to be successful since in the fit it affects too much the s - wave amplitudes of the other ( strong and electromagnetic ) channels",
    "the situation is better for the reaction @xmath201 as can be seen in fig.2 . here",
    "the features of the data ( taken from @xcite ) are well reproduced .",
    "finally we present in fig.2 an angular distribution for @xmath202 together with the data from @xcite . for this reaction",
    "the angular distributions of the existing data show indications of structures which go beyond s- and p - waves ( i.e. deviations from a parabola in @xmath203 ) .",
    "nevertheless the gross features are still reasonably well reproduced by our calculation .      in fig.3 ,",
    "we show total cross sections for @xmath0-photoproduction , @xmath19 , together with the data of @xcite ( mami ) and @xcite ( elsa ) . as expected the total cross section",
    "is dominated here by the s - wave multipole @xmath129 , whose value at threshold is @xmath204 .",
    "again these large cross sections arise from coupled channel dynamics ( forming a @xmath9 quasi - bound state ) with no explicit @xmath13 introduced .",
    "furthermore , we show in fig.3 the total cross sections for @xmath114-photoproduction @xmath205 together with the recent data @xcite measured by the saphir collaboration at elsa . in the channel",
    "@xmath206 a strong s - wave cusp effect is visible at the @xmath9-threshold .",
    "in fact the data show a structure around @xmath207 gev which is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the ( complex ) electric dipole amplitude at threshold has the value @xmath208 . above @xmath209",
    "gev the p - wave multipole amplitudes ( @xmath210 ) become very important in order to reproduce the energy dependence of the @xmath211-data .",
    "the same features apply to the channel @xmath212 , where @xmath213 .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite there is a some overestimation near threshold in @xmath214 . in both cases there appears in the data an enhancement around @xmath215 gev ( corresponding to @xmath216 gev ) .",
    "it may be due to a nucleon resonance which couples to @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "our coupled channel calculation can generate only non - resonant background amplitudes in p - waves and is thus not able to describe this enhancement if it is due to a resonance . finally , we show results for neutral kaon - photoproduction , @xmath217 , together with the recently measured total cross section data from elsa @xcite .",
    "the calculation gives an electric dipole amplitude at threshold of @xmath218 . in this channel",
    "the p - wave multipoles are completely dominant and we find a fair reproduction of the total cross section data from threshold up to about @xmath219 gev .",
    "note that in comparison to @xcite our approach does not have the problem of overpredicting the @xmath217 cross section .",
    "altogether , it is highly non - trivial to generate the pattern of s- and p - wave contributions as shown in fig.3 with its distinct features in each channel , given all the additional constraints from pion - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production ( fig.1 ) .      in fig.4 , we show some typical examples of angular distributions of differential cross sections for @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction . in the case",
    "@xmath220 the mami data @xcite display an almost isotropic angular distribution .",
    "the small deviations from isotropy at the higher energies @xmath221 gev can be explained in our calculation by the interference term of the large s - wave with the small p - wave multipoles .",
    "however , this good agreement does not necessarily imply that p - waves are indeed present in @xmath222 below @xmath223 gev since higher multipoles ( d - waves ) could cause a similar effect .",
    "the angular distributions for @xmath212 of the recent elsa data @xcite are reasonably well reproduced from threshold up to @xmath224 gev in our coupled channel calculation .",
    "similar features apply to the reaction @xmath225 for @xmath226 gev , although the measured angular distributions @xcite are ( within errorbars ) close to a straight line ( in @xmath203 ) whereas the calculated ones have larger curvature ( @xmath227-term ) .",
    "finally , we show in fig.4 two angular distributions of the differential cross section for @xmath228 together with the recently measured elsa - data @xcite .",
    "for photon energies up to @xmath229 gev the overall behavior of these data can be well described by our coupled channel calculation . in summary , we find in fact that the ( recently measured ) angular distributions for @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction are better reproduced than those for pion - induced processes ( section 3.2 ) .      in fig.5 , we show characteristic examples of polarization observables for @xmath0- and @xmath1-photopro- duction .",
    "the calculated target asymmetry for @xmath19 is positive and grows steadily with photon energy .",
    "the existing elsa data @xcite for @xmath230 are instead oscillating about zero and do not exceed magnitudes of 0.2 . for the photon asymmetry @xmath231",
    "the situation is opposite .",
    "the calculation gives small and negative values whereas the recent graal measurements @xcite have found positive photon asymmetries which grow with energy .",
    "since these features of the polarization data could in principle be explained by s- and p - wave multipoles , it appears that the real and imaginary parts of the three p - wave multipoles ( @xmath210 ) for @xmath19 are not given correctly by the present calculation , whereas their magnitudes are satisfactory . unlike the total and differential cross sections , polarization observables are very sensitive to the interference pattern of the complex multipole amplitudes .",
    "finally , we show recoil polarizations @xmath232 for @xmath114- and @xmath233-photoproduction . in the case",
    "@xmath214 the trend of the recent elsa data @xcite is roughly reproduced by the calculation .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath232 for @xmath234 @xcite can , however , not be explained .",
    "clearly , the polarization observables can not yet be satisfactorily understood in our approach which is strongly constrained by a large amount of additional empirical information .",
    "this may point to the importance of dynamical effects beyond non - resonant background amplitudes . to our knowledge",
    "there is at present no model ( with a reasonably small number of adjustable parameters ) which can simultaneously explain the huge amount of data considered here .",
    "in this work we have extended our non - perturbative chiral su(3 ) coupled channel approach to pion- and photon - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production off protons by including all strong and electromagnetic p - wave multipoles .",
    "the p - wave amplitudes of the next - to - leading order su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon lagrangian are identified with a coupled channel potential which is iterated to infinite orders in a separable lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "seven adjustable parameters @xmath235 enter in the strong interaction p - wave amplitudes . the further step to @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction does not introduce any additional free parameters since the baryon magnetic moments are well known .",
    "the latter are important in order to be able to generate large @xmath27-multipoles for @xmath1-photoproduction as required by the data .",
    "the drawback of the model at this stage is that the elastic @xmath32-channel is not yet handled with sufficient accuracy .",
    "altogether , one finds a good reproduction of the total cross sections for pion- and photon - induced @xmath0- and @xmath1-production .",
    "the gaps left in our previous work @xcite where only s - waves have been considered are filled by the p - waves of the coupled channel approach .",
    "this requires a highly non - trivial pattern of relative weights of s- and p - wave contributions .",
    "the angular distributions for @xmath0- and @xmath1-photoproduction are fairly well reproduced throughout .",
    "however , there remain some discrepancies in the angular distributions of pion - induced production and particularly in the polarization observables of photoproduction .",
    "these may point towards the importance of other dynamics or the need to include further channels ( such as the @xmath236 with its close link to the axial u(1 ) anomaly in qcd ) .",
    "work along these lines is in progress , together with a more accurate treatment of the elastic @xmath32-channel .",
    "here we give the explicit expressions for the p - wave coupling strengths @xmath237 in the relevant meson - baryon channels .",
    "the channels @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with total isospin @xmath61 and @xmath57 , @xmath60 with total isospin @xmath62 are labeled with indices @xmath238 , in this order .",
    "\\b ) @xmath240 the abbreviation @xmath241 in eqs.(7,8 ) stands for @xmath242 one makes the following observations .",
    "the su(3 ) weinberg - tomozawa meson - baryon contact vertex contributes only to the @xmath23-potentials a relativistic correction proportional to @xmath243 .",
    "the s - channel pole diagrams ( i.e. meson absorption and subsequent emission on the baryon line ) contribute of course only to the @xmath23-potentials , namely with strength @xmath244 .",
    "the contributions of the ( crossed ) u - channel pole diagrams to the @xmath24-potentials differs by a factor @xmath245 from the ones to the @xmath23-potentials ( i.e. @xmath246 versus @xmath241 ) .",
    "note that we have used the freedom to add higher order terms in the small momentum expansion in order to arrive at the fully symmetric expression for @xmath247 . finally , there are the p - wave contact terms in eq.(1 ) which generate the contributions proportional to @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
