    "the s stars are late - type giants whose spectra resemble those of m giants , with the addition of distinctive molecular bands of zro ( merrill 1922 ) . detailed abundance analyses of s stars ( e.g. , smith & lambert 1990 ) have shown that the overabundance pattern for the elements heavier than fe bears the signature of the s - process nucleosynthesis ( see kppeler et al .",
    "furthermore , the c / o ratio in s stars is intermediate between that of normal m giants ( @xmath1 ) and that of carbon stars ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "s stars were therefore traditionally considered as transition objects between normal m giants and carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( e.g. , iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "internal nucleosynthesis processes related to the thermal pulses ( a recurrent thermal instability affecting the he - burning shell in agb stars ) could possibly produce the s - process elements ( see the discussion by sackmann & boothroyd 1991 ) , and the ` third dredge - up ' ( the descent of the lower boundary of the convective envelope into the region formerly processed by the thermal pulse ) could bring them to the surface . the simple m  s ",
    "c evolution sequence faces , however , several problems , as discussed by e.g. lloyd evans ( 1984 ) , mould & aaronson ( 1986 ) and willems & de jong ( 1986 ) .",
    "the observation of tc lines ( an element with no stable isotopes ) in some but not all s stars ( merrill 1952 ; little et al .",
    "1987 ) raised another major problem .",
    "if the s - process really occurred during recent thermal pulses in s stars , mathews et al .",
    "( 1986 ) predicted that tc should be observed at the surface along with the other s - process elements .",
    "a breakthrough in our understanding of the evolutionary status of s stars came with the realization that tc - poor s stars are all members of binary systems ( brown et al . 1990 ; jorissen et al . 1993 ; johnson et al .",
    "1993 ) , and are likely the cooler analogues of the barium stars , a family of peculiar g  k giants first identified by bidelman & keenan ( 1951 ) .",
    "barium stars and s stars share the same abundance peculiarities ( e.g. , mcclure 1984 ) and high rate of binaries with suspected white dwarf ( wd ) companions ( bhm - vitense et al .",
    "1984 ; mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ; jorissen et al .",
    "both families are believed to owe their chemical peculiarities to the transfer of s - process - rich matter from the former agb star ( the progenitor of the current wd ) to the ( main sequence ) progenitor of the current chemically - peculiar red giant .",
    "it is therefore currently believed that two very different kinds of stars are found among s stars : tc - rich _ intrinsic _ s stars that owe their chemical peculiarities to internal nucleosynthesis processes occurring during thermal pulses on the agb , and tc - poor _ extrinsic _ s stars , all members of binary systems with mass transfer responsible for the pollution of the s star envelope .",
    "contrarily to intrinsic s stars that need to be thermally - pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) stars , extrinsic s stars may populate the first - ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) , prior to the core he flash , or the early agb ( e - agb ) preceding the tp - agb , since the mass - transfer scenario does not set any constraint on the _ current _ evolutionary stage of the extrinsic s star . a direct check of these predictions has been hampered till now by the difficulty in evaluating the absolute magnitude of s stars .",
    "methods used so far include individual parallaxes ( @xmath3 cyg : stein 1991 ) , membership in a binary system with a detected main sequence companion ( @xmath4 gru : feast 1953 ; 57 peg : hackos & peery 1968 ; t sgr : culver & ianna 1975 ) , membership in a moving group ( @xmath4 gru , r hya : eggen 1972a ; r and , hr 363 , @xmath5 ori : eggen 1972b ) , membership in a cluster or association ( wy cas : mavridis 1960 ; tt9 , tt12 : feast et al .",
    "1976 ) , caii k - line emission width ( hd 191630 , 57 peg : warner 1965 ; @xmath5 ori : boesgaard 1969 ) .",
    "most of these individual estimates were used by scalo ( 1976 ) to locate s stars in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , with the conclusion that they fall above the luminosity threshold for tp - agb stars , as derived from the early agb model calculations available to scalo .",
    "although scalo s conclusion appears to support the customary m - s - c sequence , statistical estimates based on the kinematics or space distribution of s stars pointed out a systematic difference between the average luminosity of non- or weakly - variable s stars and of mira s stars , the latter being about 3 visual magnitudes brighter than the former ( takayanagi 1960 ; yorka & wing 1979 ) .",
    "such a segregation apparent in these early studies might already hint at the current dichotomy between extrinsic and intrinsic s stars .",
    "the rather heterogeneous set of former luminosity determinations for s stars , along with our revised understanding of their evolutionary status , prompted the present study , based on the trigonometrical parallaxes provided by the hipparcos satellite .",

    "his value ( @xmath35 mas ) is in good agreement with the hipparcos parallax listed in table  [ tab1:sample ] .",
    "although the @xmath36 and @xmath17 ( where the subscripts j and c stand for the johnson and cousins photometric systems , respectively ) colour indices are directly provided by the hipparcos catalogue , we felt that the @xmath37 colour index , derived on a case - by - case basis , is a more appropriate temperature indicator .",
    "for most of the stars in our sample , the @xmath17 index listed in the hipparcos catalogue has been derived from a fiducial relation @xmath38 calibrated on normal m giants ( as indicated by the flags h - p in column @xmath39 of table  [ tab2:sample ] ) .",
    "several s stars in our sample , however , fall outside the validity range of such a calibration , so that  as provided by the hipparcos catalogue is not a reliable temperature indicator for our purpose .    as discussed by ridgway et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , @xmath40 for late - type stars is not a good temperature indicator either , because the temperature has opposite effects on @xmath40 : when the temperature decreases , the absorption in the @xmath41 band due to tio bands increases ( thus decreasing @xmath40 ) , whereas the black body continuum tends to increase the @xmath40 index .",

    "as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : errors ] , the intrinsic variability of s stars is indeed a major source of uncertainty on their location in the hr diagram .",

    "the hr diagram of s stars constructed from hipparcos parallaxes presented in this study fully confirms that dichotomy , by showing that :    * extrinsic s stars are hotter and intrinsically fainter than intrinsic s stars ; * extrinsic s stars are low - mass stars populating either the rgb or the e - agb , and in any case are found _ below _ the luminosity threshold marking the onset of thermal pulses on the agb .",

    "the corresponding mass for the companion is then 1.9 .",

    "the radial - velocity data accumulated so far does not allow us to test possibility ( i ) yet .",
    "possibility ( ii ) is unlikely , since the swp spectrum carries no sign of binary interaction ( like the civ @xmath125 doublet ) , the two spectra taken 8 years apart yield identical fluxes ( whereas some variability is expected in the case that the observed continuum be due to accretion on a wd ) , and finally , in the regime of rapid mass accretion by a wd , where a stable h - burning shell forms , the accreting wd mimics a supergiant rather than a main sequence star ( e.g. , paczyski & rudak 1980 ) . possibility ( iii )",
    "- 57 peg is not an s star - has already been mentioned explicitly by smith & lambert ( 1988 ) with reference to an earlier paper ( smith & lambert 1986 ) , although 57 peg is not to be found in that other paper .",
    "this last possibility clearly deserves a closer study .",
    "otherwise , 57 peg would add to the small set of tc - poor s stars ( hd 191589 , hde 332077 ) with a main sequence companion ( jorissen & mayor 1992 ; ake & johnson 1992 ; ake et al . 1994 ; jorissen et al .",
    "the evaluation of the statistical biases altering the true absolute magnitude distribution of any given observed sample of stars requires the knowledge of the selection criteria defining that sample .",
    "indeed , magnitude - limited samples are mostly affected by the malmquist bias ( malmquist 1936 ) , whereas the lutz - kelker bias plays an important role for parallax - limited samples ( e.g. lutz & kelker 1973 ; lutz 1979 ; hanson 1979 ; smith 1988 ) . for the hipparcos sample of s stars considered here ,",
