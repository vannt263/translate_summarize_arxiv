    "in the past few decades , density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite based calculations have played a pivotal role in our understanding of the electronic structure , properties and dynamics of many - electron systems such as atoms , molecules and solids .",
    "this overwhelming success is chiefly due to their ability to offer accurate results and to account for the electron correlation effects in a transparent and tractable manner .",
    "accordingly , a large number of elegant and efficient approaches are available today for the treatment of these systems covering a broad range of approximations , accuracy , computational and algorithmic schemes .",
    "consequently , this has been a very fertile area of research in the recent years and continues to remain at the forefront of modern research .    leaving aside a few attempts such as the high - order finite difference method @xcite , where without the explicit use of basis set , the discretized kohn - sham ( ks ) equation is directly solved on real - space grid , a vast majority of today s all - electron or pseudopotential dft methodologies instead employ some suitable basis set .",
    "some of the notable ones include the plane waves ( pw ) or atom - centered localized basis sets such as slater type orbitals ( sto ) , gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) , numerical radial functions , linear muffin - tin orbitals , etc . among these",
    ", the gto basis sets have gained more popularity over the others for nonperiodic systems such as molecules and clusters due to the convenient analytic routes they provide for the relevant matrix elements involving multiple centers . on a similar ground ,",
    "pw basis sets are the preferred options for periodic systems .",
    "a gaussian and augmented - plane - wave dft approach has also been reported @xcite where the ks molecular orbitals ( mo ) and the electronic charge densities are expanded in the gaussian basis and an augmented pw basis sets respectively .",
    "nowadays , linear combination of gto based dft calculations have become an invaluable and routine tool for quantum chemists , where the ks mos are typically expanded in terms of the contracted gaussian functions centered on the atoms@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electron density as well as the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potentials are also similarly expanded in terms of a finite number of _ auxiliary _ gaussian type basis functions .",
    "this obviates the necessity to compute the expensive four - centered integrals , making it an @xmath0 process . in the _ grid - based _ methods ,",
    "typically the multi - center molecular integrals are decomposed into monocentric atomic subintegrals using some weighting scheme and then each of these latter are computed numerically on the respective atomic grid @xcite .",
    "the radial integrals are performed through a variety of techniques , _ viz .",
    ", _ gauss - chebyshev quadrature of second kind @xcite , chebyshev quadratures of first and second kind in conjunction with several mapping schemes @xcite , simple gauss quadrature @xcite , transformation based on euler - maclaurin formula @xcite , numerical quadratures @xcite , etc .",
    "angular integrations often use the octahedral grid developed by lebedev @xcite or the lobatto approaches @xcite .",
    "automatic numerical integrator generating an adaptive molecular grid depending on size and shell structure of the given basis set , has also been developed @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the real - space cartesian grid as well .",
    "for example in the fourier transform coulomb method @xcite , molecular integrations are performed by dividing the gaussian shell pairs into  smooth \" and  sharp \" categories based on their exponents .",
    "of late , a multiresolution technique , combining the atom - centered and cubic cartesian grid , with divided difference interpolation playing the role of a communicator between the two , have been shown to be quite efficient @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we make a detailed systematic analysis of the performance and relevance of the cartesian coordinate grids(ccg ) in the context of molecular dft calculations .",
    "as our results in the following sections show , this is indeed capable of producing fairly accurate and physically meaningful results , at least for small molecules .",
    "we use the usual gto - type linear expansion of the ks mos ; however no additional auxiliary basis set is utilized to express the charge density or the xc potential .",
    "the basis functions , the mos , the electron density as well as the various two - electron potentials are directly set up in the 3d real ccg . the classical hartree potential is obtained accurately and efficiently through a fourier convolution method involving a set of fft - inverse fft pair @xcite .",
    "analytical one - electron _ ab initio _ effective core potentials , consisting of a sum of gaussian functions are employed to represent the core electrons while energy - optimized truncated gaussian bases are chosen for the valence electrons . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the local density functionals of homogeneous electron gas to incorporate the xc effects , while more accurate , sophisticated functionals may be considered in future .",
    "the ks matrix eigenvalue equation is solved in the usual self consistent manner to obtain the ks orbitals and eigenvalues .",
    "results are given for 12 representative molecules ( 5 diatomics and 7 polyatomics ) and 3 atoms . in order to assess the accuracy and reliability ,",
    "first we make a systematic investigation on the convergence of total energies , individual energy components and the integrated electron density , in various grid representation through a comparison with the reference theoretical results .",
    "then we compare the eigenvalues , atomization energies and the ionization energies with the literature data .",
    "potential energy curves are given for two diatomics ( hcl and cl@xmath1 ) .",
    "the article in organized as follows : section ii gives the methods of computation .",
    "section iii presents a discussion on the results obtained while a few concluding remarks are made on the future and prospect in section iv .",
    "we are interested in the single - particle ks equation for the ground state of a many - electron system under the influence of pseudopotential , which can be written as ( atomic units employed unless otherwise stated ) , @xmath2(\\mathbf{r } ) + v_{xc}[\\rho](\\mathbf{r } )   \\right ] \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r } ) = \\epsilon_i \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes the ionic pseudopotential for the system .",
    "@xmath4 with @xmath5 signifying the ion - core pseudopotential associated with atom @xmath6 , situated at @xmath7 .",
    "the hartree potential @xmath8(\\mathbf{r})$ ] describes the classical electrostatic interactions among valence electrons while the xc potential @xmath9(\\mathbf{r})$ ] represents the non - classical part of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to a set of n occupied orthonormal mos and the electronic density is given by the expression , @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s denote the occupation numbers .",
    "the basis functions and the mos are directly built on the real uniform 3d cartesian grid simulating a cubic box , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the grid spacing and number of points in the grid respectively .",
    "the electron density in the grid is given by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 signifies an element of the density matrix and the set @xmath18 contains the contracted gaussian functions centered on the atoms .",
    "any quantity including those in the above will be represented in the discretized grid with a subscript  g \" .",
    "the standard matrix form of the ks equation reads ( for a system having @xmath19 basis functions ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a @xmath22 square matrix containing the expansion coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the diagonal matrix of the orbital energies @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 corresponds to the overlap matrix and @xmath27 denotes the total ks matrix including the core hamiltonian and the effective ks potential , @xmath28 \\chi_{\\nu}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\",
    "d\\mathbf{r }         =   h_{\\mu \\nu}^{core }       + \\langle \\chi_{\\mu}(\\mathbf{r})|v_{hxc}(\\mathbf{r})|\\chi_{\\nu}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\rangle\\ ] ] the first term in the right hand side accounts for the one - electron energies in the hamiltonian .",
    "the overlap , kinetic and nuclear - electron attraction integrals are identical to those obtained in the gaussian basis - set based hf methods and we have used the standard recursion algorithms @xcite for their evaluation .",
    "significant progress has been made in the development of rigorous _ ab initio _ effective core potentials and in this work we employ the angular - momentum dependent form as proposed by @xcite . while construction of the pseudopotential matrix elements in gaussian basis sets is currently in progress , in the present implementation , they are imported from the widely used quantum chemistry program gamess output ( with printing option 3)@xcite .    for finite systems ,",
    "the simplest and perhaps the most crude way to calculate @xmath29 is by direct numerical integration , which is feasible for only small systems .",
    "however the most widely used approach is to solve the corresponding poisson equation .",
    "recently however , in the literature , the conventional _ fourier convolution _ method and some of its variants have been shown to be quite accurate and efficient in the context of molecular modeling .",
    "in particular , here we adopt the approach as put forth in @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the fourier integrals of density and the coulomb interaction kernel in the grid .",
    "it may be noted that while @xmath31 can be easily obtained from the discrete fourier transform of its real - space values by standard fft , the calculation of the latter is nontrivial and requires caution due to the presence of singularity in the real space .",
    "this is tackled by decomposing the kernel into long- and short - range terms : @xmath33 where erf(x ) and erfc(x ) denote the error function and its complements respectively .",
    "the fourier integral of the short - range part is calculated analytically whereas the long - range interaction is directly obtained from the fft of the real - space values .",
    "it may be mentioned that while the above fft - based ewald type summation method scales as @xmath34 ln @xmath34 , two other poisson - solvers have gained popularity in the context of large - scale electronic structure calculation within the ks dft framework , which are quite efficient and scale _ linearly_. in the fast multipole method ( fmm ) type approaches , the near - field contributions are tackled explicitly , whereas the far - field is treated through a clustering of the spatial cells and representing the field with a multipole expansion .",
    "another route employs the highly efficient multigrid method within the real - space formalism such as a finite - difference or finite - element scheme .",
    "a review of the various available techniques could be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most critical issues in any dft calculation is the choice of appropriate xc functionals , the exact form of which is unknown as yet and must be approximated . in the literature , an enormous number of functionals with varying complexity , property and accuracy have been published ; the present work employs the simple local xc functionals of a homogeneous electron gas ( formula v of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the absence of any analytical method",
    ", the corresponding two - electron matrix elements can be either calculated numerically on the grid or be fitted by an auxiliary set of gaussian functions as suggested by @xcite and employed in some of the existing dft codes @xcite .",
    "this work employs the direct numerical integration on the ccg to obtain these matrix elements , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath35 the algebraic eigenvalue equation is solved in the usual self - consistent manner and the total energy of the system can be obtained as a sum of the various components in the standard way .",
    "three convergence criteria were imposed in this work _",
    "viz_. , ( i ) the electronic energy differences between two successive iterations is below certain threshold ( ii ) the maximum absolute deviation in the potential is less than the specified tolerance limit and ( iii ) the standard deviation in a density matrix element remains within a prescribed threshold . for ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "10@xmath36 a.u . seemed appropriate while for ( i ) , we used both 10@xmath37 and 10@xmath36 a.u .",

    "the hartree , exchange and correlation energies of the reference values are not reported as these individual contributions were not available in the reference output . furthermore , the total integrated electron density is given as @xmath34 , which is a good measure of the quality of the results .",

    "the former uses the default `` army grade '' grid using euler - maclaurin quadratures for the radial integration and gauss - legendre quadrature for the angular integrations @xcite .",
    "the grid - free calculations @xcite ideally use the resolution of identity to simplify the evaluation of molecular integrals over functionals , rather than the quadrature grids .",
    "the latter is quite appealing , for it enables one to avoid the finite grid and associated error ; however this usually requires an extra _ auxiliary _ basis set to expand the identity .",
    "the first thing to note is that the maximum deviation in energy ( off by almost 1.30 a.u . ) from the reference value is shown by set a ; presumably the box length is insufficient to capture all the important contributions .",
    "this is also reflected in the poor value of @xmath34 .",

    ", which is lower than the reference value by 0.00113 a.u .",
    "this is a reasonable agreement with the reference value ; however there may be slight caused by the combined effect of a large @xmath14 and small @xmath15 .",
    "it is noticed that sets c and f both produce very similar results for all the quantities including @xmath34 , as one expects intuitively , for they cover the same box length . set",
    "b also corresponds to the same box size as the above two sets and indeed the total energy is again comparable ; however the individual energy components and @xmath34 show slight deviations . in set",
    "d , our results for all the quantities including @xmath34 are very nicely matching with the reference values . keeping @xmath15 fixed and increasing @xmath14 to 0.4 a. u. in set e , the total energy deviates by 0.00010 a.u . from set d and @xmath34 remains almost unchanged .",

    "e , sets d , e are to be considered two best values . in order to gain further confidence and examine the variationality ,",
    "several extra calculations ( sets f , g and h ) are done in a relatively larger and finer mesh .",

    "it may also be mentioned that a calculation for @xmath63 ( set i ) ( not shown in the table ) leads to an energy value of @xmath4029.70909 a.u . , which again exactly coincides with sets g and h. on the basis of above discussion",

    ".[tab : table4]comparison of the calculated potential energy curve of cl@xmath1 and hcl for several grid parameters along with the reference values ( grid - dft ) .",
    "negative values are given in a.u . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a few remarks may be made before passing . in this work",
    "our primary motivation was to demonstrate that the real - space ccg coupled with the fourier convolution technique as employed here for the hartree potential , could deliver accurate , physically meaningful results of `` chemical '' accuracy for molecular systems , through a small representative sets of 12 molecules and 3 atoms .",
    "thus no effort was made to reproduce either the most accurate theoretical results or the experimental values , which may be considered in future .",
    "these would inevitably require the inclusion of more extended and elaborate basis sets ( containing the polarized and diffuse functions ) as well as more accurate and sophisticated nonlocal xc functionals ( with gradient and laplacian corrections ) having correct short- and long - range properties . at this stage ,",
    "a few words on scaling is in order . denoting @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the number of grid points and basis functions respectively",
    ", one can assign the following scaling relations to the four most important steps of the whole process : ( a ) construction of the localized basis set scales as @xmath78 , ( b ) generation of the basis function in the grid scales as @xmath79 , ( c ) calculation of the electron density in the grid scales as @xmath80 , and finally ( d ) build - up of the one- and two - body matrix elements of the fock matrix scales as @xmath81 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "more detailed analysis of the scaling and computational time with respect to the system size may be considered in future communications .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that our main motivation in this work is to build up a stable platform which enables us to perform the real - time dynamics studies ( such as multi - photon ionization , high - order harmonic generation , etc . ) of polyatomics in presence of an intense laser field that utilizes and exploits the enormous advances made in lcao - gto - based molecular dft approaches over the years through many pioneering works . in taking up that",
    ", it was felt that td implementation of the overwhelmingly successful acg - based codes could be quite complicated and ccg - based approaches might be easier and straightforward to handle without making serious compromise on the accuracy and reliability . thus the purpose is not to develop another electronic structure code when there are several highly elegant and versatile quantum chemistry packages are available ; but to make a modest base which provides sufficient accuracy and reliability to pursue the dynamical calculations , as mentioned .",
    "although one could envisage some inaccuracies associated with the direct numerical integrations on the grid ( due to the incompleteness of the grid ) , as our results suggest , with a proper adjustment of the grid parameters , this may not be so detrimental , at least for the systems of this work and use of non - uniform variable or adaptive grids may partly alleviate this problem .",
    "we note that we have also made some test calculations for systems like p@xmath82 , s@xmath83 ( to be presented elsewhere ) , etc .",
    ", leading to similar kind of results as the present work .",
    "this further validates the significance of this work .",
    "we presented a detailed study on the performance of ccg in the context of atomic and molecular dft calculations .",
    "the viability and feasibility of this is demonstrated by applying it to a set of 12 molecules and 3 atoms .",
    "this was achieved through an accurate representation of the classical hartree potential through a fourier convolution method on the real grid .",
    "core electrons were represented by the hw pseudopotential and local lda xc potentials were employed .",
    "an analysis on a cross - section of the calculated quantities including energy components , eigenvalues , ionization energies , atomization energies , as well as the potential energy curves , reveal that this can offer fairly accurate and reliable results .",
    "the results are variationally well - founded .",
    "more elaborate and systematic investigation on the properties such as atomization energies , vibrational properties , reaction energies , etc .",
    ", of different chemical systems like small clusters , weakly - bonded molecules would be required to assess the success and performance of this approach . better basis sets and xc functionals would be needed for further improvement",
    ". it may be interesting to study the performance of this in the context of all - electron calculations .",
    "other interesting areas of study would constitute the real - time dynamics of small to medium size molecules in presence of a strong external td field , or the chemical descriptor analysis through various local and global quantities ( like softness , hardness , fukui function , etc ) .",
    "some of these issues are currently being investigated by us .",
