    "in the recent past atom interferometry has become a promising technique for high resolution measurements with applications in fundamental physics and for multidisciplinary purposes .",
    "examples are the measurement of the photon recoil for the determination of the fine - structure constant @xcite , the measurement of the gravitational constant g @xcite as well as gravimeters @xcite and gravitygradiometers @xcite or atomic gyroscopes @xcite .",
    "all these experiments benefit from a variety of well developed techniques to coherently manipulate , cool and trap atoms with laser light @xcite .",
    "one of the experimental key elements of atom interferometry is the source of atomic matter waves . in this article",
    "we present the design and study of a compact highly stable atomic source for a transportable atomic sagnac sensor , i.e. a dual raman - type atom interferometer based on the mach - zehnder geometry @xcite .",
    "we discuss the performance of the source with respect to the requirements imposed by an atomic sagnac interferometer using free - falling atoms as an ideal inertial reference .",
    "our design is based on a two stage mot @xcite : a 2-dimensional trap @xcite creates an atomic beam for efficient loading of a following 3d - mot .",
    "the trapped atoms are released and launched in a moving molasses , similar employed in atomic fountains ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) to imprint a precise velocity onto the atoms .",
    "this setup comprises the advantages of the formerly used source concepts for atomic gyroscopes , which have been thermal beams @xcite or loading a 3d - mot from a background vapor @xcite , i.e. a high atomic flux combined with a well defined atomic velocity .",
    "our source is especially compact compared to other state - of - the - art source concepts like zeeman - slowers @xcite or thermal beam devices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : quelle ] we discuss the requirements for a source imposed by a sagnac atom interferometers , which guided us to our source design .",
    "the experimental setup of the atomic source is described in section  [ sec : experiment ] . in the sections  [ sec : doppelmot ] and [ sec :",
    "atomiclaunch ] , we characterize the performance of our realized source with respect to the atomic flux and the launch of the atomic ensemble , respectively . finally , a conclusion and outlook for the rotational measurements is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for atom or light interferometers the achievable sensitivity is determined by a scaling factor , i.e. the resulting phase shift induced by the effect to be measured , and the minimal resolvable phase shift of the interferometer .",
    "the scaling factor for rotation measurements in atom interferometers can be calculated analogous to the optical sagnac interferometer .",
    "the phase , induced by a rotation @xmath2 of the laboratory system with respect to the interferometer , is proportional to the scalar product with the area @xmath3 enclosed by the interferometer and to the atomic mass @xmath4 divided by planks constant @xmath5  @xcite :    @xmath6    this relation shows , that atomic sagnac interferometers measure a projection of the enclosed area @xmath3 with respect to the rotation @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the area @xmath3 has to be stable both in absolute value as well as with respect to its relative pointing to the rotation vector to guarantee a well defined scaling factor .",
    "for the case of the raman - type mach - zehnder atom interferometer using free - falling atoms  @xcite , that we focus on in this article , the enclosed area is spanned by the atomic drift velocity @xmath7 and the effective velocity @xmath8 transferred by the atom - light interaction during the coherent beam - splitting , redirecting and recombination of the matter waves :    @xmath9    @xmath10 denotes the spatial separation between the atom - light interaction zones and @xmath11 the angle between the atomic drift velocity and the beam - splitting laser used for the coherent manipulation of the atoms .",
    "it is notable that the atomic mass drops out of the scaling factor for a given momentum @xmath12 .",
    "apart from the sagnac effect , the interferometer is also sensitive to accelerations @xmath13 along the direction of the raman laser beams .",
    "therefore an accelerational phase shift is induced , given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the time of free evolution of the atomic ensemble in - between the atom - light interactions .    from these relations , a set of requirements",
    "can be derived for the design of a compact sagnac interferometer and for the atomic sources employed in the device .",
    "first of all , a high stability and a precise control of the absolute atomic velocity and pointing of the atomic source is required as the atomic velocity enters the scaling factor and determines in combination with the orientation of the beam splitting lasers the orientation of the interferometers sensitive axis .",
    "moreover , the atomic sagnac sensor must discriminate between rotations and accelerations . according to equations",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) a distinction is possible by a differential measurement based on two simultaneous atom interferometers with reversed atomic beams @xcite which results in a change of the sign of the sagnac phase . in this way",
    ", a subtraction or addition of the two interferometers signals gives access to a purely rotational or accelerational induced phase shift , respectively . in order to apply this method",
    ", both sources should emit counter - propagating ensembles of atoms with equal and stable features such as velocity and pointing .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the scaling factors for accelerations and rotations can be modified by changing the atomic velocity @xmath7 .",
    "on the one hand , higher atomic velocities and a larger length @xmath10 of the setup allow to keep a constant enclosed area a while at the same time providing a lower sensitivity for accelerations and inertial noise .",
    "as an example , in our interferometer with @xmath16 mm and @xmath17 m/s the phase shift induced by the earth rotation rate is equal to a phase shift induced by accelerations of @xmath18m / s@xmath19 . concerning an imperfect suppression of accelerations , this indicates the necessity of isolating the interferometer from the laboratory vibrational noise when aiming for resolutions of fractions of the earth rotation , i.e. @xmath20rad / s or better . on the other hand , a compact device with restricted dimensions @xmath10 on",
    "the order of few centimeters recommends the use of cold and slow atoms increasing the ratio of @xmath21 from equation  [ eq:2 ] and thereby enlarging the enclosed area @xmath22 . in this way ,",
    "an atomic velocity of @xmath23 m/s seems to be a proper choice , allowing to maintain the mentioned rotational resolution of @xmath20rad / s with a reasonable resolution of the phase shift in the interferometer of about 1mrad .",
    "another important aspect of the source is the temperature of the atomic ensemble . for inertial measurements the raman beam - splitters are strongly velocity selective @xcite . as a result",
    ", the efficiency of the beam - splitting is reduced for finite temperature .",
    "this reduces the effective interferometer signal and leads at the same time to an incoherent background .",
    "these effects decrease the sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "finally , a high flux of the source , comparable to thermal atomic beams , helps to achieve a good signal - to - noise ratio and enhances the ultimately achievable phase resolution of the interferometer , given by the atomic shot - noise limit .",
    "additionally , a high atomic flux allows the adaption of the preparation time of the atomic sample with respect to the measurement time , to increase the cycling rate of the measurement , minimizing the noise contribution by the dick effect  @xcite .",
    "ideally , the best noise characteristic is achieved by performing a continuous measurement  @xcite .",
    "for the atomic sagnac sensor we developed a compact atomic source which consists of a so - called double - mot - system , where a 3d - mot is being loaded by a cold and slow atomic beam emitted by a 2d - mot .",
    "after release out of the 3d - mot , the atoms are launched by a moving molasses towards the interferometer . in this way , the atomic velocity can be controlled with high accuracy by adjusting the frequency difference between the molasses laser beams  @xcite .",
    "this frequency difference can be referenced to a high quality radio - frequency oscillator in order to achieve a higher precision and stability .",
    "our realization of the moving molasses permits an individual control of the horizontal and the vertical atomic velocity component , respectively . in this way",
    ", we can vary the horizontal velocity between 2,5 and @xmath24 m/s and , at the same time , compensate for gravity by adjusting the vertical velocity between 0 and @xmath25 m/s , resulting in flat parabolic atomic trajectories .",
    "the possibility of velocity variation allows more flexible time dependent systematic studies or even the reduction of the impact of time - dependent noise sources .",
    "the chosen trajectories and velocity values are a compromise between accelerational noise sensitivity and compactness of the sensor .    in principle",
    ", the choice of the flat parabolic trajectories allows the measurement of the all components of the rotation vector @xmath2 , like in ref .",
    "however , the design is optimized for measurements of the rotation component @xmath26 , parallel to gravity .    additionally , in combination with the 2d - mot it is also possible to perform a continuous operation of the atom interferometer and benefit from the advantage of this scheme :",
    "for this , the second 3d - stage is used only for molasses cooling and redirecting the atoms . for these further manipulations ,",
    "the use of a 2d - mot gives good starting conditions , as it is forming a brilliant and already slow atomic beam .",
    "a schematic of the source unit is sketched in fig.[fig:1b ] .",
    "one double - mot consists of two separate chambers that are connected via a differential pumping stage : the chamber where the 2d - mot is loaded from rubidium background vapor and the 3d - mot chamber at a pressure of about @xmath20 mbar .",
    "the vacuum system is mainly based on custom made parts to keep the setup as compact as possible .",
    "the overall size of one source unit including fiber couplers , beam shaping optics and magnetic coils is about 35@xmath2730@xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "the non - magnetic chambers are made of aluminum , providing large optical access .",
    "the optical substrates are directly sealed to the individual chambers , either using vacuum compatible glue ( for the 2d - mot ) , or indium - sealings ( for 3d - mot and interferometer ) .",
    "the rb background pressure in the 2d - mot is maintained by a heatable vacuum tube containing a rb ampule which is connected to the 2d - mot via a valve .",
    "the 2d - mot and the 3d - mot chambers have a rectangular and a 8-cornered shape , respectively ( in top view ) .",
    "the rectangular shape of the 2d - mot chamber reflects the transverse cooling volume of 80@xmath30mm@xmath19 , similar to @xcite .",
    "the 3d - stage is connected to the interferometer via a vacuum adapter of diameter @xmath31mm@xmath32 , which can be displaced vertically to allow for even greater variations of the atomic trajectories from almost flat to steep parabolas with a maximum starting angle of about @xmath33 .",
    "the geometry of the 3d - mot cooling beams is chosen such that the horizontal laser beams are placed at an angle of 45@xmath34 to the 2d - mot atomic beam axis , whereas the vertical laser beams are perpendicular to it .",
    "the magnetic field for the 3d - mot is generated with external coils , directly wound onto the chamber ( 3d - mot ) , or in the case for the 2d - mot , on a frame rigidly fixed to the chamber , respectively .",
    "two atomic sources of this kind are integrated into our experimental setup for operating a dual atom interferometer .",
    "this setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] , is placed on a single optical breadboard ( 1.2@xmath35m@xmath32 ) , surrounded by a @xmath36-metal magnetic shield , which suppresses stray magnetic fields by a factor of about 40 .",
    "the laser beams for the cooling light are generated by from 2 commercial high power diode laser systems in mopa configuration ( toptica ta100 ) , delivering @xmath37mw for the 2d - mot and @xmath38mw for the 3d - mot . from the 3d - mot laser four independent laser frequencies",
    "are derived for the moving molasses by using acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) in double - pass configuration .",
    "additionally , this laser generates a light beam co - propagating with the cold atomic beam formed by the 2d - mot , which enhances the forward directed atomic flux thanks to light pressure .",
    "this so - called  pusher-beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] ) is also frequency controlled using a aom .",
    "a self - made external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) produces repumping light for atoms in the lower hyperfine level @xmath39 .",
    "all lasers are frequency controlled using saturated absorption spectroscopy near the d@xmath40-line of @xmath0rb at @xmath41 nm .",
    "the laser sources are placed on a separate optical breadboard and the beams are delivered to the main apparatus with polarization maintaining ( pm ) optical fibers . in all mot stages",
    "the repumping light is superimposed to the cooling light and delivered to the experiment with the same optical fibers , using one individual fiber for each light beam .    the beam shaping optics at the fiber exits , for example beam collimation or polarization retarders , are rigidly fixed to the vacuum chamber . in this way",
    ", the stability of the optical setup is improved with respect to free - space optical paths .",
    "beam diameters are 80@xmath30mm@xmath19 for the 2d - mot , and @xmath42 mm for the 3d - mot .",
    "in our source concept , the 2d - mot replaces a zeeman - slower and serves for generating a large flux of atoms with velocities low enough to be captured by the 3d - mot or further cooled in the 3d - molasses .",
    "the characterization of the 2d - mot focused therefore on the optimization of the atomic flux and and the velocity distribution of the 2d - mot s atomic beam by tuning the relevant parameters such as laser power or detuning as well as the magnetic field gradient @xmath43b .",
    "the flux and velocity distribution were measured by detecting the atomic fluorescence with a calibrated photo diode while the atoms are interacting with a retro - reflected detection laser beam tuned onto the @xmath44 transition of the d@xmath40 line .",
    "the detection laser beam of @xmath24 mm diameter and @xmath45mw power was placed @xmath46 mm downstream from the 2d - mot exit . for the velocity measurement",
    "the atomic beam was chopped with a second transverse , running wave laser beam tuned onto the @xmath44 transition deflecting the atoms with its light pressure , the so - called  plug-beam . analyzing the time - dependent atom number and integrating over all velocities we can deduce the atomic flux as well as the velocity distribution .",
    "the results for a combined measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for different values of the total cooling laser power and magnetic field gradient .",
    "the laser detuning @xmath47 for this measurement was chosen to be @xmath47=-1.2@xmath48 ( @xmath49 : linewidth of the d@xmath50-transition ) , which was shown to be optimal in a separate measurement .",
    "we infer the optimal magnetic field gradient @xmath43b for a laser power of @xmath51mw to be about @xmath52g / cm .",
    "the measurement shows that the yielded flux can be enhanced by increasing the laser power and saturates at a value of about @xmath51mw total laser power .",
    "the optimal flux achieved in this measurement was @xmath53at / s .",
    "the corresponding velocity distributions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , display that the most probable velocity is less than @xmath54 m/s for all laser powers that have been used during the measurement .",
    "it shows additionally that increasing the laser power results in higher mean atomic velocities .",
    "this is also theoretically predicted by a 2d - mot model , for example derived in ref .",

    "due to limited optical access on the atomic beam axis we apply a related and simpler scheme with only one single traveling beam . for a detuning @xmath47=+1.8@xmath48 to the @xmath44 transition and with @xmath45mw power",
    "pusher-beam enhances the atomic flux by a factor 4 .",
    "but as the beam is acting on the longitudinal axis , the mean velocity is also slightly increased .    to estimate the beam divergence",
    ", we proceeded as follows : by cutting a part of the  plug-beam with a knife edge transversally , a part of the atomic beam is not deflected and can still reach the detection zone . consecutively moving the edge over the  plug-beam , and monitoring the residual detected fluorescence , we can assign the atomic beam a gaussian profile . comparing the measured atomic beam waists at different distances from the 2d - mot exit",
    ", we calculate the divergence to be about @xmath42mrad .",
    "the performance of the 2d - mot comes close to that of thermal sources used for atomic sagnac interferometry  @xcite , while it it allows at the same time to keep the setup compact and transportable .      in our present interferometer",
    "the 2d - mot serves to quickly load the 3d - mot , which further compresses and cools the atomic ensemble .",
    "therefore , a major characterization aspect for the combined 2d-/3d - mot operation was the 3d - mot loading rate .",
    "this loading rate was examined for different parameters ( like the rubidium background pressure in the 2d - mot ) and various configurations , for example with and without the  pushing-laser beam .",
    "we infer the loading rate from the time dependent filling of the 3d - mot , which is deduced from the atomic fluorescence , by switching the 2d - mot atomic beam .",
    "the switching is performed by mechanical shuttering the light and by tuning the magnetic field of the 2d - mot . without the 2d - mot operating , the influx of atoms into the 3d - mot",
    "is completely stopped and we find no detectable filling of the 3d - mot by residual background rb atoms . in the realized setup presented in this paper , the saturation of the absolute 3d - mot atom number",
    "is determined by collisions with background ( non rb ) gas atoms with a time constant of about @xmath45seconds .",
    "for maximum loading rate , we find as optimal parameters for our 3d - mot : detuning @xmath57 and magnetic field gradient @xmath43b@xmath58g / cm .",
    "varying the 3d - mot laser power , we infer a similar dependence like given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for the 2d - mot . under usual conditions when serving two complete source units we work with @xmath59mw laser power per 3d - mot beam , which is at the beginning of saturation .",
    "the dependence of the loading rate on rubidium vapor pressure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the rb pressure is adjusted by tuning the rb - reservoir temperature .",
    "the loading rate does not saturate for the chosen temperatures which still leaves room for further boosting the loading of the 3d - mot ( compare for example @xcite for a saturation behavior with increasing rb - vapor pressure ) .",
    ".,width=325 ]    the 3d - mot loading rate can also be enhanced by the use of the  pusher-beam , see section  [ subsec:2dchar ] . for the combined operation of the 2d-/3d - mot this laser beam has to be aligned with a slight tilt of about 3@xmath34 with respect to the atomic beam , which avoids disturbance of the 3d - mot . in this configuration , the loading rate can be enhanced by a factor 3.5 with @xmath60mw light power in the  pusher-beam .    with the normal parameters used in everyday operation ( total laser power 2d - mot @xmath61mw , total laser power 3d - mot @xmath62mw , rb - reservoir temperature 90@xmath34c ) and the additional  pusher-beam , we obtain a 3d - mot loading rate of @xmath63at / s , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . with these parameters ,",
    "the maximum 3d - mot atom number we obtain is @xmath64 atoms , which saturates due to collisions with background ( non - rb ) atoms .",
    "operating the source with all important parameters deeper in the saturated regime , e.g. laser power or rb vapor pressure , we can obtain loading rates @xmath1at / s .",
    "in this section , we investigate the features of the emitted atomic ensemble relevant for the determination of the scaling factor such as the accuracy of the forward velocity and pointing and orientation of the source , as well as the parameters determining the effective signal of the interferometer , i.e. the atomic temperature .    to characterize the stability of the starting conditions for the moving molasses , we record the spatial position of the atoms just before the launch .",
    "for this , in situ images of the fluorescence of the atoms trapped in the mot are imaged onto a ccd camera over 30 minutes while cycling the experiment about 800 times .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",

    "aiming for resolutions of rotations of better than @xmath20rad / s , the performed measurements show that the performance of the realized atomic source will not be a limitation for the short - term sensitivity of the interferometer . however , a further increase of the resolution of rotations or the enhancement of the long - term stability require an improvement of the relevant parameters like the velocity stability or the pointing of the source . in this respect ,",
    "the control of the corresponding molasses parameters , like the laser power or laser beam alignment , is currently improved .",
    "this measures should additionally allow a further reduction of the atomic temperature . moreover , our source design permits the planned extension of the velocity control for the two sources , allowing a tuning of both relevant velocity components for each source individually , which lead to a further optimization of the overlap of the atomic trajectories .    beside the described application for interferometry",
    ", the presented source concept could also be adapted for other kinds of atom optic experiments , where a brilliant atomic source with flexible and precisely controlled atomic velocity in the range of several m@xmath110s is desired , for example the injection of atoms into a guiding potential @xcite .",
    "thanks to the compactness of our setup we will be able to realize the final atomic sensor as a transportable device .",
    "this will be an interesting option for combined measurements with other high resolution atomic or optical sensors @xcite , allowing interesting studies in applied sciences like geology or geodesy such as the search for variations of the earth rotation .",
    "this work is supported as part of the sfb 407 of the  deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft  and as part of the finaqs cooperation of the european union ."
