    "the jacobi last multiplier ( jlm ) @xcite plays , in first order linear partial differential equations , a role similar to the integrating factor in first order ordinary differential equations . if one can guess a jlm , it is possible to find the general solution of the equation , or for equations with more than two variables to reduce the number of variables .",
    "however in the case of quasilinear first order partial differential equations we can always integrate them going over to the characteristics .",
    "so the role of jlm is certainly not crucial as an integrating tool of pdes , but it has an important role in many other applications .",
    "for example , jlm has recently received a great deal of attention in the theory of @xmath0-symmetries of differential equations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present a first approach to an equivalent concept for difference equations . in the case of partial linear difference equations",
    "no integration technique equivalent to the use of the characteristics exists @xcite so the use of the jlm can be very proficuous .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a short review of jlm in first order partial differential equations , in particular the method to obtain the equation satisfied by a jlm . in section 3 ,",
    "the case of a difference equation in a two dimensional lattice is fully developed together with some examples .",
    "the conclusions presented in section 4 are devoted to a summary of the results obtained , showing the difficulties which appear when extending the method to a higher number of variables , and some future perspectives .",
    "let us consider a first order linear partial differential equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are some smooth functions on the variables @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 functionally independent solutions of this equation are known , @xmath5 , we can write the following determinant @xmath6 \\frac{\\partial u^{(1)}}{\\partial x^{(1 ) } } & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial u^{(1)}}{\\partial x^{(n ) } } \\\\ \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial u^{(n-1)}}{\\partial x^{(1 ) } } & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial u^{(n-1)}}{\\partial x^{(n)}}\\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] for any function @xmath7 .",
    "the determinant ( [ det ] ) is zero only if @xmath8 is a solution of equation ( [ veceq ] ) , as it can be easily shown since the elements of the matrix are the coefficients of the forms @xmath9 and the functions @xmath10 are functionally dependent if @xmath8 is a solution of the differential equation .",
    "then the equations @xmath11 have the same set of solutions and must be proportional as @xmath4 functionally independent solutions fix the coefficients of the linear first order pde up to a global factor : @xmath12 the multiplicative factor @xmath13 is called the jacobi last multiplier .",
    "if we expand the determinant ( [ det ] ) using the first row , we find that equation ( [ jac ] ) can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the corresponding minors of the first row of the matrix in ( [ det ] ) .",
    "comparing the coefficients of the derivatives of @xmath8 in ( [ last ] ) , we get @xmath16    we can write now a differential equation satisfied by the functions @xmath15 @xmath17 this is a general relation arising from the particular form of the functions @xmath15 , written as minors of the matrix ( [ det ] ) , and it does not depend on the fact that the functions @xmath18 are solutions of the linear homogeneous first order pde ( [ veceq ] ) with coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the equation for @xmath15 can be considered as a consistency condition for the system of equations in @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "let us write ( [ minor ] ) as @xmath23 where by @xmath24 we denote the @xmath25-column of the matrix ( [ det ] ) and the symbol @xmath26 means that the corresponding @xmath27th - column of ( [ det ] ) is removed . deriving ( [ minor1 ] ) with respect to @xmath28 and summing over @xmath27 we get : @xmath29 since @xmath30 we have @xmath31 finally , since @xmath32 the sum of all terms in ( [ minor2 ] ) is zero and consequently we get the equation : @xmath33 in three dimensions , this expression is the classical formula of vector calculus stating that the divergence of the cross product of two gradient vectors is zero . in an arbitrary dimension it can be written using exterior products and differential forms ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we can derive an equation for @xmath13 , differentiating ( [ adef ] ) with respect to @xmath28 and summing over all @xmath27 between 1 and @xmath34 .",
    "we get @xmath35 and consequently , taking into account ( [ eca ] ) , we obtain : @xmath36 this equation depends only on the differential equation ( [ veceq ] ) and thus @xmath13 does not depend on any particular solution . from a practical point of view ,",
    "equation ( [ lastm ] ) is an inhomogeneous version of the original equation ( [ veceq ] ) .",
    "however , as in the method of integrating factors , if we know a particular solution of ( [ lastm ] ) , we could use it to compute a solution of ( [ veceq ] ) .",
    "this is exploited in the examples presented in the next subsection where we consider a few examples and we compare the results obtained by the use of jlm with those obtained through other methods of integration of the linear first order partial differential equations .      as a simple illustration of the method ,",
    "let us consider the following examples of partial differential equations in two and three independent variables .",
    "@xmath37    from ( [ lastm ] ) the equation for @xmath13 is : @xmath38 an obvious solution of this equation is @xmath39 .",
    "then , @xmath40 and ( [ adef ] ) reduces to the compatible overdetermined system of equations : @xmath41 solving this system we find a non trivial solution of the original partial differential equation @xmath42 the general solution can be obtained by computing the characteristic variable @xmath43 and is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary function of its argument defined by the initial conditions or from the boundary values .      @xmath46    the equation satisfied by a jacobi last multiplier @xmath13 is @xmath47 looking for a particular solution of this equation , for instance @xmath48 , we find @xmath49 , and the system of equations we have to solve is ( with @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 given a solution @xmath8 of ( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e4a ] ) is an overdetermined system for @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , we can take @xmath54 and the new solution @xmath53 is obtained from the following overdetermined system of equations @xmath55 a solution of ( [ e4b ] ) is @xmath56 from the method of characteristics we find that any solution of ( [ e4 ] ) is a function of the two particular solutions we have found @xmath57",
    "a difference equations for one dependent variable @xmath8 is is a relation between the function in various points of a lattice .",
    "if the lattice is @xmath58 dimensional it can be put in correspondence with the points of an @xmath58dimensional space .",
    "an ordinary difference equation ( o@xmath59e ) is a difference equation on a one dimensional lattice . in this case",
    "the lattice is given by an ordered sequence of points on a line characterized by their relative distance ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two subsequent points , their distance @xmath62 will be @xmath63 .",
    "we can then introduce a @xmath64shift operator @xmath65 such that @xmath66 and in term of it we can construct delta operators which in the continuous limit , when @xmath67 , go over to the derivative .",
    "an example of such delta operator is given by the right shifted discrete derivative [ d1 ] _ x u(x_i)= = . in some instances",
    "it may be more convenient to introduce symmetric delta operators @xcite as , for example , [ d2 ] _",
    "x^s u(x_i)= = .",
    "an o@xmath59e of order @xmath68 , i.e. involving @xmath69 points of the lattice , can thus be written as [ d3 ] e(x_i , u_i , t_x u_i , t_x^2 u_i , t_x^n u_i)=0 , or , equivalently , in term of the operator delta as [ d4 ] f(x_i , u_i , _",
    "x u_i , _ x^2 u_i ,",
    "_ x^n u_i)=0 .",
    "however the equation ( [ d3 ] ) ( or ( [ d4 ] ) ) is not completely defined unless we specify the values of the distance between the various lattice points @xmath70 , @xmath71 involved in the equation .",
    "this implies that an o@xmath59e will be defined only if we attach to it a second equation which defines the lattice .",
    "the set of these two equations is called a _",
    "difference scheme_.    in many instances , when the equation comes from some physical problem , the lattice is a priori given , as for example , when all the points are equidistant so that @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the lattice equation is trivial @xmath73 .",
    "however there may be situations , as , for example , discretizing a continuous differential equation to solve it on the computer , when we want to take advantage of the freedom of the lattice to preserve in the discretization other properties of the continuous system like its symmetries @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the lattice may be defined by a non trivial equation maybe also depending on the dependent variable so as to have a denser grid when the solution varies rapidly .          in the case of o@xmath59e s",
    "there is at least one natural parametrization of the differences which in the continuos limit go to the corresponding derivatives and which simplifies the discretization procedure @xcite .",
    "such parametrization gives a one - to - one transformation between the lattice differences , discrete approximations of the derivatives , and the lattice points .",
    "a similar situation exists also in the case of partial difference equations ( p@xmath59e s ) , however in this case the definition of the lattice must be given by compatible equations as the independent variables depend on several indices ( see fig.2 for the @xmath74dimensional case where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , depend on two indices ) .",
    "in general the difference scheme will be given apart from the p@xmath59e , by a set of equations which define the lattice and depend on the number of independent variables and on the problem we are solving @xcite .",
    "however in this case , up to now , no natural parametrization exists which in the continuous limit goes to the corresponding derivatives and which simplifies the discretization procedure .",
    "work on this is in progress @xcite .",
    "the solution of linear o@xmath59e s follows the standard technique of solving ordinary differential equations .",
    "the solution is given by a linear combination with arbitrary coefficients of powers of the independent variable and the exponents are defined by a characteristic polynomial . in the case of linear p@xmath59e",
    "s the situation is more complicate ( as is also the case for partial differential equations ) . as one can read in @xcite",
    "_ the method of trial and error is still one of the basic methods for obtaining explicit solutions_. if the p@xmath59e has constant coefficients then a few techniques can be found in jordan book @xcite , such as laplace method of generating functions , or the method of fourier , lagrange and ellis @xcite .",
    "if the p@xmath59e does not depend explicitly on one of the two independent variables then boole symbolic method can be applied @xcite .",
    "consequently , it seems particularly important to extend the last jacobi multiplier technique to the case of linear p@xmath59e s as this will provide solutions also in the case of non constant coefficient p@xmath59e s . in the following , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will consider the case of an orthogonal lattice , where the independent variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be written in term of just one index , i.e. @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and we will just concentrate on the solution of the difference equation .",
    "let us write an equivalent discrete expression defined on 4 lattice points of the linear first order partial differential equation ( [ veceq ] ) .",
    "we could write this expression in terms of the shift operators but we will use the difference operators ( [ d1 ] ) to follow closely the continuous case and to limit the number of points involved . let us consider a two dimensional orthogonal lattice .",
    "in such a case ( [ veceq ] ) reads : @xmath79 as in the continuous case , if @xmath80 is a solution of ( [ dif ] ) , the @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 \\delta_x u^{(1)}_{n , m } & \\delta_y u^{(1)}_{n , m } \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] has a determinant equal to zero if and only if the function @xmath83 is also a solution of the difference equation ( [ dif ] ) .",
    "the minors of the first row of ( [ matrix ] ) are @xmath84 and it is trivial to check by direct computation that @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfy the equation @xmath87 then , as in the continuous case , there exists a function @xmath88 , the jacobi last multiplier , such that , @xmath89 consequently , the jacobi last multiplier @xmath88 satisfies a difference equation , which is the discrete analog of the differential one ( [ lastm ] ) @xmath90 given any particular , even trivial , solution @xmath88 of the p@xmath59e ( [ f3a ] ) , the solution of the overdetermined system ( [ f1 ] ) provides a solution of ( [ dif ] ) .",
    "we consider now a few examples of the calculus of the solution of linear difference equations using the jlm .",
    "we consider the equation : @xmath91 the equation for the jacobi last multiplier @xmath88 is the same as that for @xmath83 : @xmath92 and a particular solution is obviously @xmath93 which gives , taking into account ( [ f1 ] ) , the following system of equations for @xmath83 : @xmath94 to solve this sytem of difference equations we need to specify the lattice . if we consider a uniform lattice in both variables i.e. : @xmath95 so that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are arbitrary initial points , the system ( [ f2 ] ) reduces to a system of o@xmath59e s , one for each direction : @xmath100 using the well know procedures for solving o@xmath59e s @xcite we get a particular solution of ( [ pippo1 ] ) , depending on three arbitrary constants , i.e. : @xmath101      we choose the equation : @xmath102 which corresponds to ( [ dif ] ) with @xmath103 the equation for the jacobi last multiplier can be written as : @xmath104 a particular solution of the equation ( [ f3 ] ) can be obtained requiring that both its curly brackets be identically zero . in such a case",
    "we get a particular solution @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an abitrary constant .",
    "if we introduce this result in ( [ f1 ] ) with @xmath107 and @xmath108 given by ( [ ff1 ] ) , we get the following system of compatible equations @xmath109    as in the previous example , we need the lattice equations to solve equations ( [ eq2a ] ) . using again a uniform lattice in each variable ,",
    "we get x_n = x_0+h_xn , y_m = y_0+h_y m , +    to solve the first equation we define , @xmath110 and the equation satisfied by @xmath111 is : @xmath112 which is the recursion equation for the euler digamma function @xmath113 . then @xmath114    substituting in the second equation in ( [ syst ] ) we easily obtain an equation fo @xmath115 : @xmath116 solving this equation as in ( [ syst ] ) , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a constant",
    ". then , the complete solution is @xmath119.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this paper we have extended the results presented by jacobi in 1844 to get solutions of linear partial differential equations to the case of partial difference equations in two independent variables .",
    "if we consider an @xmath34-dimensional lattice of independent coordinates , that is the lattice coordinates , @xmath3 , depend only on one index @xmath120 , @xmath121 , it is easy to see that we get into trouble as the minors are nonlinear functions and the difference operator , in contrast with the differential one , does not satisfy leibniz rule .",
    "in fact denoting by @xmath122 the value of @xmath8 at the point @xmath123 and using the following notation : @xmath124 the discrete derivatives reads : @xmath125    the difference equation is : @xmath126 where @xmath127 are some functions depending on a finite number of points in the lattice .",
    "if we know @xmath4 particular solutions of the equation , @xmath128 , we can construct the matrix @xmath129 and define the minors @xmath130 , @xmath131 , corresponding to the first line of the matrix above ( the column @xmath27 is removed ) : @xmath132 as in the continuous case ( see section [ contin ] ) , the @xmath4 solutions fix the coefficients of the difference equation ( [ three ] ) up to a factor .",
    "then , using cramer s rule , we get @xmath133    to find the compatibility relation we will closely follow the argument we used in the continuous case",
    ". then , writing @xmath134 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-the column of ( [ adiscrete ] ) and @xmath135 means that the @xmath27-th column is absent , we get that the sum @xmath136 is equal to zero .",
    "in fact @xmath137 since @xmath138 as the independent variables commute . then @xmath139 and",
    "the sum ( [ sumdisc ] ) is zero .",
    "this is exactly the same equation we found in the continuous case .",
    "however , since leibniz rule does not apply in the case of difference operators , the expression ( [ sumdisc ] ) is not equal to @xmath140 , as the difference operator does not follow the same rules as the differential operator when it is applied to a determinant .",
    "there are some additional terms , as @xmath141 , whose consequences have to be analyzed",
