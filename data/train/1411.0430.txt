    "earlier diffraction experiments were interpreted as that the 2@xmath2 structure is replaced by other structural modifications whose volume fractions are temperature and history dependent .",
    "it was shown that in the low - temperature limit , the dominant crystal structure mode appears to be close to a tripling of the basic cecoal cell ( denoted as the 3@xmath2 structure @xmath2 @xmath8 15.3  ) .",

    "in fact , the high - temperature crystal structure of cerusn  can be viewed as already a modulated structure that is commensurate with the cecoal type ( leading to two inequivalent sites ) .",
    "ab - initio calculations for this kind of structure suggested that cerusn  is close to a magnetic instability and predicted an antiferromagnetic ( af )  @xcite structure for this material .",

    "recently , it has been shown that resonant x - ray scattering spectra on a cerusn  single crystal indeed exhibit features compatible with a presence of two different ce valence states  @xcite . however , no direct microscopic proof for the spatial distribution of spin densities ( i.e. showing magnetic and non - magnetic ce ions ) that would be in accord with theoretical prediction exists up to date .",
    "the high - temperature commensurate cell becomes modulated incommensurately at lower temperatures leading to a distribution of atomic sites around their high - temperature positions ( or better , around average positions in a cecoal type of structure ) .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that a re - distribution of valence states is to be expected .",
    "indeed , the resonant x - ray scattering experiment resolved tiny changes in the spectral weights belonging to 4@xmath13 and 4@xmath14 states as one goes accross the structural transition .",
    "however , it was impossible to conclude whether at low temperatures magnetic and non - magnetic ce moments still coexist and how they spatially distribute .",
    "our previous unpolarized neutron diffraction experiment has suggested a smooth modulation of moments magnitudes between 0.11 and 0.95 @xmath15/ce  @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time it came to a rather surprising result , namely that the largest moments are found for ce ions that have the shortest distances to their neighbors .    in this contribution",
    "we report polarized neutron diffraction ( pnd ) experiments using a cerusn  single crystal performed at high and low temperatures with magnetic field up to 6.2  t applied close to the @xmath2-axis in order to determine spin densities in the commensurate and incommensurate states and to identify the magnetically different ce ion sites . at room temperature",
    "we observe a spin distribution that is entirely in agreement with theoretical prediction , i.e. a coexistence of easily polarizable and hardly polarizable ce sites , where the latter is identifyied as site ce1 . at low temperatures , assuming the simplest commensurate approximant of the incommensurate structure ( the trippling of the original cecoal subcell leading to three inequivalent ce sites )",

    "the polarization of the incident neutron beam was 97 % .",
    "a magnetic field of 6.2 t has been applied nearly along the @xmath2-axis with the sample wrapped in an aluminium foil to prevent stresses .    at both temperatures , due to the magnet opening and the fact that the magnetic field had to be applied along the @xmath2-axis , only ( @xmath23 ) reflections with l @xmath24 3 ( within the average lattice framework )",

    "the magnetic susceptibility behaves according to a modified curie - weiss ( mcw ) law . for the measurement performed between 250 and 350 k ( above the hysteretic range ) and between 50 and 150 k ( below the hysteretic range ) , different parameters are derived .",
    "while above the transition we obtain for all three principal directions an effective moment that is reduced with respect to the free ce@xmath0 ion configuration below the transition the effective moment is reduced further by about 20 % .",

    "while at high temperature the magnetization for all the directions increases linearly and only very slowly with no saturation tendency , at 2  k two metamagnetic - like transitions are visible for the @xmath2-axis orientation , with the two remaining orientations showing only slow magnetization increase with no saturation tendency . for the @xmath2-axis orientation , a magnetization of 0.019(1 ) @xmath15/ce",
    "is reached at 285 k and at 6.2  t. at 2  k and the same field it increases to 0.744(2 ) @xmath15/ce . clearly , at higher fields , a field - induced saturated ferromagnetic ( f ) state is established for the @xmath2-axis orientation .      in order to obtain reliable information regarding the magnetic spin densities from the polarized neutron experiment , precise information about crystal structure is needed .",
    "for the room temperature structure we have utilized parameters determined fom our previous x - ray single crystal diffraction and neutron powder diffraction that are in very good agreement with structural information obtained by other groups  @xcite .",

    "we have collected total flipping ratios from 187 bragg reflections ( 85 unique ones ) .",
    "magnetic structure factors have been calculated with a help of the cambridge crystallography subroutine library @xcite suite programs .",
    "spin densities were determined using the software package prima @xcite that calculates the most probable distribution that is in agreement with the symmetry of the parent lattice , observed magnetic structure factors and associated errors using the maximum entropy ( maxent ) method  @xcite .",

    "comparison with the crystal structure in the same orientation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows that spin densities in the form of clouds elongated along the @xmath2-axis ( caused by a lesser resolution along the direction of the applied field ) are found at places that correspond to both ce1 and ce2 atoms .",
    "however , the densities are not equal at the two inequivalent sites .",
    "the integration corresponding the ce@xmath0 ionic radius of 1.34  for the coordination number 12  @xcite reveals that while the ce2 posseses a total magnetic moment of 0.017(3 ) @xmath15 , the ce1 site only 0.004(2 ) @xmath15 , i.e. substantially less than at the ce2 site .",
    "these values are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the average of the two values is smaller than the bulk magnetization of 0.019 @xmath15/ce achieved at 6.2 t suggesting a non - zero contribution from other sites or conduction electrons .",
    "indeed , the integration reveals that also the interatomic space is significantly polarized . the signal intensity",
    ", however , does not allow conclusions regarding possible polarization at the ru / sn sites .",
    "another way to treat the experimental data is the direct refinement of the measured flipping ratios .",
    "we assume all the magnetic moments to be centered on the given atomic sites .",
    "various atoms are characterized by magnetic form factors f(@xmath27 ) that depend on the scattering vector @xmath27 and have in general orbital ( @xmath28 ) and spin ( @xmath29 ) parts , where the total magnetic moment @xmath30 = @xmath29 + @xmath28 .",
    "the cerium magnetic form factor is usually expressed within the dipolar approximation by the formula @xmath31 ) = @xmath32 ( @xmath27 ) @xmath33 , where @xmath34 = @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the radial integral for the ce@xmath0 valence state  @xcite .",
    "an equivalent expression can be written down for the ru magnetic form factor .",
    "the best fit allowing magnetic moments on ce and ru sites indicates that no significant magnetic moment resides at neither of the two inequivalent ru sites . by assuming a magnetic moment on the ce sites",
    "only , we could obtain a rather good fit of the experimental data .",
    "the best fits yield the moment values listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] . while it is difficult to conclude anything regarding the coupling of the spin and orbital parts at the ce1 site , the spin and orbital moments on the ce2 atoms seem to be clearly parallel to each other with the @xmath34 parameter strongly reduced at 285 k with respect to expected value of 1.33 calculated for both , @xmath5 and @xmath4 cerium @xcite .",
    "thus , the derived magnetic form factor deviates from that of the free ion ce@xmath0 situation by having different coupling of the spin and orbital part .",
    "we interpret this as a consequence of 4@xmath3 electron delocalization in agreement with the suggestions made for @xmath5 cerium @xcite .",
    ".[tab : table1]magnetic moment values of a cerusn  single crystal determined from the direct fitting of pnd data and by the integration of the spin density maps obtained by a maximum - entropy method .",

    "the parameter @xmath34 = @xmath28 / @xmath39 is listed as well .",
    "bulk magnetization measurements lead magnetization values of 0.019(1 ) and 0.744(2 ) @xmath15/ce at 285  k and 2 k , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as mentioned above , below room temperature the commensurate crystal structure becomes incommensurate .",
    "two sets of structural bragg reflections are observed at 2 k for cerusn .",
    "the main reflections that correspond to the average cecoal type structure and incommensurate ones that can be described by a propagation vector @xmath40  @xcite . for the polarized data refinement at low temperatures we could use structural information obtained on the same crystal from previous unpolarized neutron diffraction work  @xcite .",
    "however , due to limitations of the available computer codes  @xcite , we had to approximate the incommensurate crystal structure by a commensurate one .",
    "since the modulation is close to a trippling of the original cecoal structure along the @xmath2-axis , we have used the three times larger @xmath2-axis parameter .",
    "the positional parameters were taken from literature @xcite . this leads to three independent ce , ru and sn sites . as in the case of the high temperature structure , ce atoms have distinctly different ce - ru and ce - sn neighbor distances , those for the ce3 site being the shortest and the ce2 the longest .",
    "the corresponding structural approximant is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a .",
    "spin densities were reconstructed from magnetic structure factors calculated from 173 flipping ratios ( 92 unique ones ) .",
    "these were collected in the same angular range as at high temperatures .",
    "the resulting color - coded spin density distribution of cerusn  at 1.7 k , projected nearly along the @xmath17-axis , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . at the first glance",
    ", it is apparent that the density clouds correspond very well to positions of ce ions .",
    "the density values are , however , much larger than those at high temperature and different between the sites .",
    "integration of the map in three dimensions , corresponding the the ce@xmath0 ionic radius of 1.34  , reveals values of 0.58(2 ) , 0.82(3 ) and 0.42(2 ) @xmath15 for the ce1 , ce2 and ce3 site , respectivelly .",
    "we see that all three sites carry a significant magnetic moment that is , however , much smaller than the ce free - ion moment of 2.14 @xmath15 .",
    "also in this case we observe that the average of the three magnetic moments is somewhat smaller than the bulk magnetization , indicating significant polarization at other crystallographic sites and/or intersticial regions .",
    "in addition , we observe that in contrast to our previous unpolarized study , the largest magnetic moment is obtained for the site with the largest nearest - neighbor distances .",
    "the second method , a direct refinement to the flipping ratios @xcite , in which we assume all the magnetic moments to be centered on the ce atomic sites and described by the ce@xmath0 form factor yields values given in table  [ tab : table1 ] . clearly , the agreement between magnetic moments determined from the two methods is very good .",
    "the orbital ( @xmath28 ) and spin ( @xmath29 ) parts were refined independently for the three ce sites , leading to different @xmath34 parameters that are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] as well .",
    "an interesting point is that we observe distictly different @xmath34 parameters for the three sites . at first , all the @xmath34 parameters are strongly reduced for the ce@xmath0 state .",
    "second , there is a clear relation between the @xmath39 and @xmath34 on one side and the nearest ce - ru distances on the other .",
    "the larger the distances , the more develop the magnetic moment and the higher are the @xmath34 value .",
    "this is a direct consequence of different spin and orbital parts for the three sites .",
    "normally , for systems with less than half - filled @xmath3-electron shells it is expected that the spin - orbit coupling aligns spin part antiparallel to the orbital part .",
    "this effect is known as the third hund s rule and while for the ce2 site that has ru / sn neibhbours at the largest distances , the rule is fullfilled , the two components are found to be parallel for the ce1 and ce3 sites . from the table  [ tab : table1 ] it is seen that the magnetic moment on the ce2 site is dominated by the orbital part in contrast to the ce3 site where the orbital part is considerably quenched and the spin part dominate . these values and their ratio were previously associated with the degree of delocalization in elemental cerium @xcite .",
    "localized @xmath3 electrons are supposed to be dominated by the orbital part with a magnetic form factor close to the ce@xmath0 state .",
    "itinerant 4@xmath3 states should be dominated by the spin part with the orbital contribution supressed , having the @xmath34 parameter small . in that case",
    "it can be shown that the third hund s rule is violated @xcite .",
    "we see , that within cerusn  at low temperatures there are , depending on the ce atoms , 4@xmath3 states which behave as localized electrons and states that are itinerant .",
    "the current observation is also able to shed more light on the mechanism leading to the structural transition itself .",
    "recent resonance x - ray scattering observations show across the structural transition an increase of the 4@xmath14 spectral weight @xcite .",
    "such an inrease is also observed for the @xmath41 transition in elemental cerium @xcite where a 15 % volume reduction is observed @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that the mechanism leading to a significant volume collapse in cerusn  ( with respect to the average cecoal type structure ) is of a similar type .",
    "two scenarios were put forward in order to explain the isostructural transition in cerium : ( i ) the kondo volume collapse where a drastic change in the effective hybridization and thus kondo temperature occurs and ( ii ) the orbital - selective mott transition , in which the hoping between the @xmath3 orbitals leads to an itinerant @xmath3 electrons in the @xmath5 state .",
    "recently , it has been shown experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that the magnetic form factor in @xmath5-ce is of the ce@xmath0 type discarding the latter model .",
    "accordingly , a hybridization between the localized 4@xmath3 and the @xmath42 electrons leading to a different kondo energy scales in @xmath4 and @xmath5-ce is identified to be the mechanism behind the volume reduction .",
    "the situation in cerusn  is similar only to a certain extend . at high temperatures we deal with ce states that are rather delocalized and not exactly in the ce@xmath0 state",
    "this is also reflected in a reduced @xmath34 parameter for the ce2 site that is very similar to this parameter calculated in early @xmath43 calculations for @xmath5-ce @xcite . at low temperatures we deal with two thirds of ce sites where the 4@xmath3 electrons are delocalized and in a ce@xmath1 valence state .",
    "one third of 4@xmath3 electrons , in contrast , seems to be more localized than at high temperatures .",
    "this means that we must consider two competing mechanisms - one analogous to the kondo volume collaps mechanism as in elemental cerium , where the 4@xmath3 electrons are in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 states localized and the other that goes just in the opposite direction and leads to more localized states at low temperatures .",
    "one can speculate at this moment about the influence of thermal vibrations ( phonons ) that were identified recently to play an important role in stabilization of the more 4@xmath3 localized @xmath4 cerium @xcite .",
    "an inelastic neutron experiment focused on the temperature development of phonon spectra should be able to clarify this .",
