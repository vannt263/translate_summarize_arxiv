    "of late , there has been a lot of activities in discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods for approximating solutions of partial differential equations .",
    "this is mainly due to their flexibility in local mesh adaptivity and in taking care of nonuniform degrees of approximation of the solution whose smoothness may exhibit wide variation over the computational domain . like finite volume element methods ,",
    "these methods are element - wise conservative , but are ideally suited to @xmath0-adaptivity . for application of dg methods to elliptic and parabolic problems , we may refer cockburn _",
    "@xcite for review of development of dg methods .",
    "one such dg method is the local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) method which allows for arbitrary meshes with hanging nodes , elements of various shapes and piecewise polynomials of varying degrees .",
    "earlier , cockburn and shu  @xcite have introduced this method for convection - diffusion problems and subsequently , @xmath0-version error estimates are derived by castillo _",
    "et al . _",
    "the ldg method was then extended to elliptic problems by cockburn _",
    "et al . _",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "optimal order of convergence of ldg method applied to a poisson equation has been established .",
    "subsequently , perugia and sch@xmath19tzau  @xcite have discussed _ a priori _ @xmath0-error estimates for linear elliptic problems and then , gudi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have derived @xmath0-error estimates for nonlinear elliptic problems . for higher order partial differential equations using ldg method , see @xcite and references , therein .    in this paper ,",
    "@xmath0-dg methods which , in particular , include the original ldg scheme , are applied to the problem ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) .",
    "further , it is observed that if polynomials of degree at least @xmath3 are used in all the elements , the rates of convergence in the @xmath1-norm of the displacement @xmath20 and its velocity @xmath21 are of order @xmath22 and @xmath3 , respectively , provided the stabilization parameter @xmath23 with @xmath24 when @xmath25 it is shown that the order of convergence of @xmath20 is @xmath26 based on expanded mixed type ritz - volterra projection as an intermediate solution , optimal estimates are derived . using a variant of baker s nonstandard formulation , _ a priori _ estimates in @xmath1 norm for the displacement",
    "are established with reduced regularity conditions on the exact solution .",
    "all the above results are proved for semi - discrete method .",
    "then , an implicit - in - time method is applied to the semi - discrete scheme to provide a completely discrete method and stability results are proved . again a use of a modified baker s argument combined with a more finner analysis to take care of integral term yields _ a priori _ estimates for the displacement in @xmath27-norm .",
    "finally , some numerical experiments for the ldg method have been performed with different degrees of polynomials and numerical results are presented to support the theoretical results .",
    "our @xmath0-estimates are also valid for second order wave equations only by making @xmath28 for applications of other dg methods to wave equations , we may refer to @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we denote @xmath29 as a generic positive constant which does not depend on the discretizing parameter @xmath2 and degree of polynomial @xmath30 but may vary from time to time .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with preliminaries and basic results to be used subsequently in the rest of the article . in section 3 , we formulate dg methods .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an extended mixed type ritz - volterra projection and related estimates . in section 5",
    ", we discuss _ a priori _ error estimates for the semidiscrete scheme .",
    "section 6 focuses on the completely discrete scheme based on an implicit method and related error estimates are derived . in section 7 , some numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the theoretical results .",
