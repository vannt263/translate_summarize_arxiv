    "analyses at modern collider experiments enter a new dimension of event complexity . at the lhc ,",
    "for instance , physics events will consist of the final state products of the @xmath2 collisions taking place during each readout cycle .",
    "in addition , a number of physics questions is studied in channels with complex event topologies and configuration ambiguities occurring during event analysis .     with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "b ) the visible reconstructed partons of this channel.,width=312 ]    one item in the long list of examples is a channel of @xmath5-quark associated higgs production , @xmath6 with @xmath3 ( see fig.[tthfeyn.eps].a ) .",
    "the event topology of four @xmath7-jets , two light - quark - jets , an isolated muon , missing energy and possible additional jets from initial state radiation ( isr ) and final state radiation ( fsr ) imposes highest demands on detectors and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "in addition , non - trivial ambiguities must be resolved during event analysis .",
    "even if all final state products could be reconstructed perfectly ( as illustrated in fig.[tthfeyn.eps].b ) and no isr or fsr effects occured , at least 24 different configurations would be possible .",
    "finite jet resolutions , limited efficiency and purity of the @xmath7-tagging as well as the presence of additional jets complicate ambiguity resolution and signal identification .",
    "this task can be approached with a likelihood method based on characteristical event variables , where each possible event configuration is developed individually and rated with the likelihood function ; the most probable of all interpretations finally is selected .",
    "such an approach can be implemented by object - oriented coding and suggests the use of a class collection , that provides event containers for the reconstructed objects ( muons , jets , missing energy , vertices , collisions , etc . ) and handles relations between the individual objects ( as , for instance , vertex relations for particle decays ) .",
    "due to the large number of ambiguities occurring during the reconstruction of @xmath6 events , these classes are required to offer automated copy functionality for containers , objects and corresponding relations .",
    "the application of a _ generalized event container _ comes with a number of desirable side - effects .",
    "if used to define an abstraction interface between the output of event generator , simulation or reconstruction software and the physics analysis code , the latter is protected from changes in the underlying software packages to a large extent .",
    "this reduces code maintainance and increases code lucidity .",
    "in addition , unnecessary duplication of the analysis code can be avoided : so can the influence of detector effects ( studied by direct comparison of the results on generator , simulation and on real data level ) be investigated ad hoc , i.e.  with the same analysis source code .",
    "analysis factories , in which a number of analyses are executed at the same runtime , identifying and distinguishing different physics processes or studying systematic uncertainties , can easily be realized when using common physics objects and a common event container model in each of the analyses .",
    "analysis environments based on a well - defined , generalized event container also provide a basis for efficient team work .",
    "collaboration in ( and supervision of ) groups of students is facilitated , and knowledge transfer between subsequent generations of analysts as well as between different experiments is fostered .    in this article , we present the physics analysis expert ( pax ) , a c++ toolkit for particle physics analysis that provides such a generalized event container together with various built - on functionalities .",
    "the pax kernel , introduced in the year 2002 @xcite and released at the chep03 conference in 2003 @xcite , is currently available as 2.00 version . for the convenience of connecting to existing software packages",
    ", pax is realized in the c++ programming language @xcite .",
    "it provides additional functionality in top of the vector algebra of the widely - spread libraries clhep @xcite or root @xcite .",
    "the pax container model as well as file i / o are based on the c++ standard template library ( stl ) @xcite .",
    "the pax toolkit provides three types of generalized physics objects :    * particles ( or reconstructed objects ) , i.e.  lorentz - vectors , represented by the class _ paxfourvector _ , * vertices , i.e.  three - vectors , represented by the class _ paxvertex _ , * and collisions , represented by the class _",
    "paxcollision_.    these objects are able to establish relations , and can be stored and managed in event containers , represented by the _ paxeventinterpret _  class .",
    "the _ paxfourvector _  class ( see fig.[paxfourvector.eps ] ) represents particles or reconstructed objects ( such as muons , electrons , missing energy , jets etc . ) .",
    "it inherits its basic lorentz - vector characteristics from the well - known libraries clhep or root .",
    "commonly needed , additional properties such as particle - id , status , charge etc .",
    "can be stored in data members .",
    "specific information ( such as b - tags , jet cone sizes or energy corrections , for instance ) can be stored in the so - called user records .",
    "user records are collections of string - double pairs , meant to hold object information complementary to data members .",
    "all pax physics objects own user records ( instances of the class _ paxuserrecord _ ) and provide methods for quick access to individual user record entries .",
    "each instance of a pax physics object carries an unique integer key ( the so - called _ paxid _ ) and a string name ( the so - called _ paxname _ ) .",
    "an integer workflag facilitates tagging of individual objects .",
    "print methods are provided to allow monitoring of object state and established relations on various verbosity levels .",
    "copy constructors are provided to perform deep copies of pax physics objects .",
    "the _ paxvertex _  class , sketched in fig.[paxvertex.eps ] , represents the spatial point of decays in particle reactions .",
    "thus , in analogy with the _ paxfourvector _ , it obtains its basic three - vector characteristics also from the clhep or root package .",
    "the _ paxcollision _  class ( see fig.[paxcollision.eps ] ) allows the separation of collisions in multicollision events , as they occur at high - rate hadron colliders .",
    "it provides the relation management necessary to associate _ paxvertex _  and _ paxfourvector _",
    "objects with different collisions in the event .",
    "each pax physics object can record pointers to an arbitrary number of instances of arbitrary c++ classes .",
    "this way , the user can keep track of the data origin within the detector reconstruction software , for instance .",
    "access to the pointers is possible at the same runtime during any later stage of the analysis .",
    "a typical use case is the need to re - fit a track which requires access to the hits in the tracking chamber .",
    "the pax object that represents this track , i.e.  a _ paxfourvector _",
    "instance , provides the two template methods _",
    "addpointer@xmath8type@xmath9(name , i d , pointer ) _ and _ findpointer@xmath8type@xmath9(name , id)_. the argument _ name _ is supposed to correspond to the c++ class name , e.g.  _ type _ , the argument _ i d _ is a unique integer identifier for the referenced instance of the c++ class _ type _ , and the third argument is a pointer to this instance .",
    "the mechanism behind is sketched in fig.[paxexperimentclass.eps ] . the class template _",
    "paxexperiment@xmath8type@xmath9 _ provides storage , access , and clone of the pointer of type _ type_. its",
    "base class _ paxexperimentclass _  is used as the interface to the pax classes which are enabled to store and access the pointer through the c++ ` dynamic_cast ` operator .    when copying a pax physics object , all pointers are copied as well by making use of the _ clone ( ) _ method .",
    "type@xmath9 _ provide recording of arbitrary pointers with pax objects.,width=312 ]      the principal duty of the pax relation management is handling of decay trees .",
    "the manager is based on the mediator design pattern , described in detail in reference @xcite . in this design",
    "all relations are kept locally ( i.e.  every object knows about all their directly related objects ) , so that global relation directories can be avoided .        speaking of pax physics objects , this means , that each _ paxcollision _",
    "object owns relation managers ( see fig.[paxrelmgr.eps ] ) that carry pointers to the related _ paxvertex _  and _ paxfourvector _  objects . at the same time , the _ paxvertex _",
    "objects hold pointers to their related _ paxcollision_s as well as to their incoming and outgoing _ paxfourvector_s . by the same token , _",
    "paxfourvector_s know about their related _",
    "paxcollision_s and about their begin and end _ paxvertex _  objects . with this functionality",
    ", pax allows to store complete multicollision events from parton to stable particle level , including four - momenta and spatial vertex information .",
    "in addition , the pax relation management is used to record analysis histories : each object , which is copied via copy constructors , keeps pointers to its original instances . this way the user may always go back and ask for original properties of objects which might have changed during the development of the analysis .",
    "a powerful feature , implemented by means of the relation management , is the so - called locking mechanism .",
    "it is implemented to enable the user to exclude parts of decay trees from the analysis ( i.e.  excluding a lepton from a jet finding algorithm , etc . ) .",
    "if one particle or vertex is locked , all the objects down the decay tree ( and the history ) will be locked , too . locking and unlocking are relaized by setting or removing the lock - flag owned by each pax physics object .",
    "the pax kernel provides the base classes _ paxmap@xmath8key , item@xmath9_and _ paxmultimap@xmath8key , item@xmath9 _ , which inherit from the stl classes _ map@xmath8key , item@xmath9 _ and _ multimap@xmath8key , item@xmath9 _ , respectively . the explicit inheritance has been chosen to provide the use of existing stl objects and methods with these pax classes .",
    "this way , iterations of pax maps can be performed by using either the pax iterator classes ( _ paxiterator _ , _ paxmapiterator _ , _ paxmultimapiterator _ ) or the commonly known stl iterators .",
    "all pax classes which serve as containers are based on the class _ paxmap _  ( see fig.[paxcontainers.eps ] ) .",
    "the _ paxeventinterpret _  class , illustrated in fig.[paxeventinterpret.eps ] , is the generalized event container provided by pax . by incorporating the previously described functionalities ,",
    "it is capable of holding the complete information of one multicollision event with decay trees , spatial vertex information , four - momenta as well as additional reconstruction data in the user records . physics objects ( i.e.  instances of the classes _ paxfourvector _ , _ paxvertex _  and _ paxcollision _ ) can be added or created with the _ paxeventinterpret__::add ( ) _ and _ paxeventinterpret__::create ( ) _ methods . depending on the object type , a pair of _ paxid _  and pointer to the individual object is stored in one of three maps ( _ paxfourvectormap _ , _ paxvertexmap _  or _ paxcollisionmap _ ) .",
    "access to these maps as well as direct access to the physics objects is guaranteed via methods such as _ paxeventinterpret__::getfourvectors ( ) _ and _ paxeventinterpret__::findfourvector()_. at deletion of a _ paxeventinterpret _  instance , all contained physics objects will be deleted , too .",
    "the _ paxeventinterpret _  class is so named , because it is intended to represent a distinct interpretation of an event configuration ( e.g.connecting particles to the decay tree according to one out of a number of hypotheses , applying different jet energy corrections , etc . ) . to facilitate the development of numerous parallel or subsequent event interpretations , the _ paxeventinterpret _  class features a copy constructor , which provides a deep copy of the event container with all data members , physics objects , and their ( redirected ) relations .",
    "the pax toolkit offers a file i / o scheme for persistent storage of the event container , based on stl streams .",
    "it allows the user to write the contents of _ paxeventinterpret _  instances with all contained physics objects ) are not stored to disk .",
    "] as well as their relations to pax data files .",
    "when restoring the data from file , an empty _ paxeventinterpret _  instance is filled with the stored data and objects and all object relations are reproduced .",
    "the pax data file format provides multi - version and multi - platform compatibility .",
    "it is built of a hierarchy of binary data chunks : the top level unit is an event , which consists of an arbitrary number of event interpretations .",
    "the event interpretation chunk consists of data members , user records as well as chunks for each of the contained physics objects .",
    "each chunk carries header information ( one byte for unit type and four bytes for data amount information ) and the actual binary data .",
    "this allows file structure checks and fast positioning .",
    "therefore , the user can quickly skip arbitrary numbers of events in pax data files , without having to sequentially read and discard .",
    "pax also provides the possibility to write event units to strings ( and to restore the _ paxeventinterpret _",
    "instances from those strings ) .",
    "this way , the user can store pax objects to any data format supporting strings or binary data fields ( like databases or experiment specific data formats ) .      as a complement to the pax kernel",
    ", we released two accessory packages for reading standard event generator file formats .",
    "the _ paxtuple _",
    "package provides transfilling of decay trees stored in the hepevt or root ntuple data formats to _ paxeventinterpret _  containers .",
    "accordingly , the _ paxhepmc _ package gives access to hepmc files .",
    "in addition , interfaces developed and posted by pax users , that fill pax objects with specific data of hep experiments , are available via the pax web page @xcite .      the pax kernel and its officially supported accessories",
    "are coded and maintained by a core group of currently six developers at cern and the aachen and karlsruhe universities .",
    "new developments and code modifications pass a certification procedure and are discussed and adopted in regular video meetings . as a guideline , new developments focus on aspects of performance improvement and on user feedback .",
    "new releases are to be backward compatible .",
    "version management of the software project is handled with a web - browsable version control system ( cvs ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the continuously updated pax web page @xcite provides download of the various versions of pax kernel and accessories ( based on the aforementioned web - browsable cvs repository ) .",
    "it also provides the pax users guide@xcite , a comprehensive text documentation of the pax toolkit , as well as class reference and fast navigator pages for download or online use .",
    "the web page also offers access to mailing lists , in which pax users are informed about new developments and in which technical issues of pax analyses can be discussed .",
    "to exploit the features offered by the pax toolkit , physics analyses might be realized , for instance , according to the example structure illustrated in fig.[paxanai.eps ] .    there , a dedicated , experiment - specific interface class for filling the pax containers ( i.e.  _ paxeventinterpret _  instances ) represents the interface between detector reconstruction software and pax - based physics analysis .",
    "once all relevant information is filled , the analysis code is called , and the pax objects ( as obtained by the filling class or at any subsequent stage of the event analysis ) can be stored persistently to pax data files for later use .",
    "analysis results might be further processed with help of the root package .    with",
    "an analysis consistently formulated with pax objects , the filling class can be exchanged easily , and the identical analysis code can be applied , for instance , directly to the output of a monte carlo event generator or a fast simulation software , see fig.[paxanaii.eps].a .",
    "furthermore , the use of pax data files , which provide the distilled experimental event information , allows fast analysis of the reconstruction data decoupled from the experiment - specific software and data storage environment , see fig.[paxanaii.eps].b .",
    "pax has been made available within the software environments of the experiments cdf , d0-version since april 2005 . ]",
    "( both tevatron ) and cms ( lhc ) .",
    "following the same principles , the integration of pax into the latter is described as a general example .",
    "the pax toolkit is provided by the cms software environment as an external package @xcite , enabling the physicists inside the cms collaboration to use pax without having to care about installation or setup of the package .    an extensive example analysis for the use of pax with the detector reconstruction software orca @xcite",
    "is included in the cms cvs repository @xcite . in this example , the ( ambiguous ) reconstruction of the partonic process of the decay @xmath10 is carried out by using reconstructed muons and missing transverse energy . the missing information about the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is obtained with a @xmath11-mass constraint , which yields ( up to ) two analytical solutions , and thus two possible event interpretations .",
    "subsequently , both interpretations are developed in two separate _",

    "the most recent of these studies makes use of the pax event interpretation concept to develop possible event interpretations in a manner similar to the one described in the previous cdf example .",
