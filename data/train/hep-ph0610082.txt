    "we consider a space time of the form  @xcite @xmath0 ( @xmath1 usual 4-d minkowski space ) and  a space - like @xmath2 dimensional manifold .",
    "we assume that a discrete group @xmath3 acts on , @xmath4 , and replace @xmath5 which is compact .",
    "if we expand the fields in some complete set of functions , the modes that do not depend on the  coordinates will correspond to the light excitations . as",
    "an example take @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 e :  y y ,   i :  y - y ,   t :  y y+l ; = 0 ,   i^2 = e @xmath9 denotes an orbilfod @xmath10 .",
    "fourier expanding the fields   ( y ) & = & _ n _ n+ ( 2n y / l ) + _ n _ n- ( 2n y / l ) the kinetic energy contains a term @xmath11 that generates a mass @xmath12 , so that all the @xmath13 modes are heavy .",
    "light modes , @xmath14 are associated with @xmath15independent functions .    in these theories",
    "it is possible to recast the hierarchy problem in terms of the compactification scale@xcite : consider  @xcite will be considered hereafter . ]",
    "@xmath16 in 5d , then h ~_0^l a_n=4(x , y ) dy , [ eq : h ] generates 4-d scalar excitations ( @xmath17 if we impose appropriate behavior of @xmath18 under @xmath19 ) .",
    "radiative corrections generate a non - trivial effective potential @xmath20 , which is _ finite _ ( up to field independent constant ) and calculable .",
    "the reason is that all divergences in the full 5-d theory are associated with local operators while none of the terms in @xmath20 can be local since @xmath21 itself is not .",
    "the @xmath21 mass is usually @xmath22 and is not driven to an uv cutoff by radiative corrections .",
    "we will be interested in models without fundamental scalars , where @xmath21 ( eq . [ eq : h ] ) drives  ( ssb ) in the light theory .",
    "for example , in a 5-d abelian model with @xmath23 , invariance under @xmath3 requires @xmath24 , while for the fermions one usually _ assumes _ @xmath25 .",
    "but in this case @xmath26 , which is _ incompatible with @xmath27_. since the @xmath28 behavior under @xmath3 is necessary for ssb , we must modify that for the @xmath29 , and the sign change in @xmath30 suggests we include the charge conjugate field @xmath31 .",
    "this illustrated by the following choices for an abelian model @xcite :     ^c(-y ) = e^-i ( y+l)a^(y ) = a^(-y ) = a^(y+l ) & a^(y ) = - a^(-y ) = a^(y+l ) a^4(y ) = - a^4(-y ) = a^4(y+l ) & a^4(y ) = + a^4(-y ) = a^4(y+l )    the light spectrum contains a vector ( scalar ) for the ( non ) standard boundary conditions and a chiral fermion when @xmath32 ( both cases ) .",
    "no symmetry protects the light - scalar mass and radiative corrections will , in general , generate a non - trivial effective potential that may lead to ssb , see fig.[fig : fig ] for @xmath33 .",
    "this does happen , but it requires 2 fermion species with different charges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig ] ) ; the scalar then receives a mass and ( vev ) @xmath34 : after one loop effects are taken into account the model has no massless excitations . expanding in a fourier series the fields",
    "take the form a^(y ) = _ n a^_n ( _ n y ) ; a^4(y ) = _",
    "n a_n^4 ( _ n y ) ; ( y ) = _",
    "n e^i _ n (    c _ n^ * _ n    ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the @xmath37 antisymmetric matrix . in particular the @xmath38 receive a majorana mass terms of the form @xmath39 , and may prove useful when constructing the neutrino sector of the electroweak theory .     and @xmath40 are present , for the remaining parameters see @xcite.,height=768 ]    for @xmath41 ( no `` orbifolding '' ) the model will contain light vector - like fermions , a vector boson and a light scalar with ssb when @xmath42 fermion flavors of different charges are present in which case both fermions and scalars receive @xmath22 masses .",
    "it is worth to mention that in this model ( for @xmath33 ) spontaneous cp violation takes place @xcite .",
    "in more complicated groups one can mix boundary conditions insuring that the @xmath43 contain 4-dimensional light vectors for some gauge indices @xmath44 , and light scalars for others . for example in a 5-d @xmath45 theory we can choose @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be even and periodic in @xmath48 .",
    "the light modes of the first set will be the gauge boson of a 4d @xmath49 theory while those of the second set form an @xmath50 doublet ( 4d scalar ) that can receive a vev through 1-loop effective potential .",
    "the @xmath51 parameter satisfies @xmath52 and a careful choice of the fermionic content leads to vev@xmath53 ; unfortunately the weak mixing angle differs widely form the observed value : @xmath54 .",
    "the general case@xcite is best described in terms of a double spinor @xmath55 : ( y ) = ( y - l ) = -_5 ( -y ) a_a^n(y ) = _ ab a_b^n(y - l ) = ( -1)^_n,4 _ ab a_b^n(-y ) where @xmath56 are unitary , @xmath57 orthogonal and satisfy = -^t = ^t ; f_abc = f_abc _ a a _ b b _",
    "c c = f_abc _ a a _ b b _",
    "c c the first relation insures that @xmath58 and @xmath59 have the same number of degrees of freedom ; the second implies that @xmath60 are automorphisms of the gauge group .",
    "the light modes ( denoted by a @xmath61 superscript ) then satisfy 0 = 0 = -_5 0 a_n0 = a_n0 = ( -1)^_n4 a_n0 by appropriate choice of group and fermion content one can have dirac and/or majorana fermion masses , as well as radiatively - induced ssb for the @xmath62 .",
    "the best case scenario would correspond to one which experiences two stages of symmetry breaking : @xmath63 the first generated by the choice of @xmath64 etc . and the second by ssb through the scalars @xmath21 .",
    "for these models to be phenomenologically viable this should lead to @xmath65 and @xmath66 . since all couplings are specified by the group structure ,",
    "it is possible to determine in full generality under which conditions these constraints are satisfied .",
    "demanding that there be exclusively sm vector bosons implies the model can contain only one light scalar multiplet of isospin @xmath67 , associated with a root @xmath68 , whose component of @xmath69-isospin @xmath70 gets a non - zero vev .",
    "the gauge vectors can be expanded as a_= e _",
    "w_^+ + e_- w_^- +  w_^0 +   b_+ ; a_4 = e_+ ^e_- ( cartan and root generators are denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively ) where @xmath73 is a root not parallel to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the masses are generated by = ( h^2/2 ) \\ { ||^2 w^+w^- + ( w^0+b)^2 } so @xmath76 .",
    "standard lie algebra properties imply @xmath77 , which combined with @xmath78 , imply @xmath79 : _ any 5-d model without scalars , kinetic brane terms or anomalous @xmath80 is unacceptable _",
    "we have discussed non - standard boundary conditions involving charge - conjugate fermion fields .",
    "they offer attractive model building possibilities .",
    "in particular the abelian example shows that the non - standard fermionic boundary conditions are mandatory when the @xmath80 gauge symmetry is supposed to be broken in the light sector of 4d effective theory .",
