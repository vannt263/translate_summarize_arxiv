    "<S> we investigate conductance fluctuations as a function of carrier density @xmath0 and magnetic field in diffusive mesoscopic samples made from monolayer and bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fluctuations correlation energy and field , which are functions of the diffusion coefficient , have fundamentally different variations with @xmath0 , illustrating the contrast between massive and massless carriers . the field dependent fluctuations are nearly independent of @xmath0 , but the @xmath0-dependent fluctuations are not universal and are largest at the charge neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the second order conductance fluctuations ( mesoscopic rectification ) . </S>",
    "<S> its field asymmetry , due to electron - electron interaction , decays with conductance , as predicted for diffusive systems .    </S>",
    "<S> reproducible conductance fluctuations ( cf ) are one of the most striking signature of phase coherent transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance of a mesoscopic sample results from interference between all wave packets traversing the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this interference pattern is sensitive to variations in disorder configuration , fermi energy or magnetic flux , leading to reproducible cf as one of these parameters is changed . in diffusive or chaotic systems </S>",
    "<S> the cf amplitude has been shown to be universal @xcite and ergodic , i.e. independent of the mechanism of phase randomization ( magnetic field , fermi energy , configuration of impurities for diffusive systems , sample shape for ballistic systems ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cf amplitude is of the order of @xmath1 , with a coefficient which only depends on the symmetry class of the mesoscopic system . </S>",
    "<S> the typical correlation energies @xmath2 and fields @xmath3 of the fluctuations depend upon the typical time @xmath4 and area @xmath5 over which interference occur : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cf have been extensively investigated in metallic and semiconducting systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recently discovered graphene @xcite provides a unique system in which the fermi energy and diffusion constant can be tuned at will , over a broad carrier density range extending from hole to electron metallic conduction . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical simulations of cf in graphene suggest a possible enhancement of the fluctuation amplitude with respect to standard mesoscopic samples , depending on the strength or nature of disorder ( intervalley scattering ) @xcite . on the experimental side cf </S>",
    "<S> have been reported by several groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but to our knowledge the present work is the first complete investigation of their correlations and amplitudes as a function of fermi energy and magnetic field , for both monolayer ( ml ) and bilayer ( bl ) graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the comparison lies in the fact that whereas ml and bl have similar resistivities and thus mean free paths ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , the ( massless and massive ) carriers have different velocities because of the different dispersion relations in these two materials . thus the diffusion constants and therefore correlation energies and fields will have different carrier density dependences , providing a powerful test of the applicability of the theory of mesoscopic fluctuations in those systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the variations with carrier density @xmath0 of the correlation field and energy are well related to those of the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we also find , in contrast with @xcite , that the amplitude of @xmath0-dependent fluctuations are largest near the charge neutrality point .    </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the second order conductance fluctuations @xcite which , unlike linear conductance , are a probe of coulomb interaction and screening , an important issue in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> second order cf are inherent to systems lacking spatial inversion symmetry ( because of random disorder in diffusive systems or geometry in ballistic systems ) . </S>",
    "<S> they stem from current - induced changes in the carrier density , which in turn , via coulomb interaction , modify the electrostatic potential landscape , thereby inducing a current - dependent , or second order , change in the conductance of mesoscopic samples . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the first order conductance which is even in field , the second order conductance has an odd part in field which was calculated for ballistic @xcite and diffusive @xcite systems . whereas this mesoscopic rectification was experimentally investigated in ballistic mesoscopic systems ( gaas / gaalas quantum dots , aharonov bohm rings , carbon nanotubes @xcite ) , we provide in this letter the first measurement of second order cf in a diffusive system . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions , that the odd in field rectification decreases with conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> both ml and bl graphene samples ( the nature of which was confirmed by raman spectroscopy ) were exfoliated and deposited onto doped silicon substrates with a 285 nm thick oxide . </S>",
    "<S> the electrodes were fabricated by electron beam lithography and sputter deposition of 40 nm thick palladium , providing low contact resistances ( @xmath9 for the ml and @xmath10 for the bl ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 for the ml and bl , respectively ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . the carrier density @xmath0 is controlled for both systems by the voltage @xmath15 applied to the doped silicon back gate , via @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the gate capacitance per unit area , @xmath18 the fermi wave vector , and @xmath19 the gate voltage of the charge neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> the transport parameters of both samples were determined via classical magnetoresistance measurement , described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the transport mean free path @xmath20 of both ml and bl varies between 25 and 100 nm over the @xmath21 gate - voltage range probed . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath20 is much smaller than the sample dimensions , so that both samples are in the diffusive regime . </S>",
    "<S> two terminal resistance measurements were performed at 60 mk in a dilution refrigerator with resistive lines filtered at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the ac current amplitude @xmath22 was adjusted between 5 and 50 na , depending on the sample resistance , to avoid heating while optimizing the signal to noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second harmonics @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the ac voltage were measured with a low noise voltage preamplifier and a lock - in amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second order conductances were determined via @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field was limited to less than 0.4 t , so that the contribution of shubnikov de haas oscillations is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the cf of @xmath27 were measured as a function of b and @xmath15 , for both the ml and bl ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 dependent fluctuations were analyzed in 3 v - wide windows , over which the density @xmath0 can be considered practically constant . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of @xmath27 , even in @xmath28 as expected in a two probe measurement , were characterized by their correlation functions and their amplitude @xmath29 , defined as the square root of their variance . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram of these fluctuations is gaussian over the whole parameter range .    , the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) ( resp . at high carrier density , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to @xmath30 for the ml and @xmath31 for the bl ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cnp is at @xmath32 for the ml and @xmath33 for the bl . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear ( b , d ) that the amplitude of @xmath15-dependent cf is larger at the cnp than at high density , both for the ml and the bl . </S>",
    "<S> panel d also shows the reproducibility of the cf , via two nearly indistinguishable successive gate voltage sweeps ( open dots and red line ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    the correlation gate voltage and field were determined in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the fourier power spectrum of the fluctuations as a function of @xmath34 , the conjugate variable of @xmath28 or @xmath15 , for each set of field or gate voltage data corresponding to a given average carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum is the fourier transform of the correlation function of the fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> each dataset yielded exponential - like functions which correspond to a lorentzian correlation function in the direct space ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath35 at low @xmath34 yields the correlation gate voltage or field @xmath36 for each dataset . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation energy @xmath37 is related to the @xmath15 correlation scale @xmath38 by @xmath39 for the ml and @xmath40 for the bl , with @xmath41 the ( constant ) low energy effective mass in the bl . </S>",
    "<S> these relations are incorrect near the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) because of density inhomogeneities , so that we deduced @xmath37 from @xmath38 via @xmath42 determined in @xcite .    in fig.[fig2 </S>",
    "<S> ] we compare the variations of @xmath37 and @xmath43 to the predictions @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the typical longitudinal and transverse length of interfering trajectories ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the thermal and the phase coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we first determine the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the conductivity and @xmath52 is the density of states , @xmath53 is constant ( @xmath54 m / s ) for the ml and is @xmath55 for the bl . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath20 and @xmath18 were extracted in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at @xmath56 @xmath57 varies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 for both samples over the entire density range investigated . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently @xmath37 is expected to vary like the thouless energy @xmath63 , and @xmath43 like @xmath64 @xcite . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , this is indeed what is found : the correlation energy deduced from the experimental data follows @xmath65 , and the correlation field follows @xmath66 for the ml and @xmath67 for the bl . in particular , we find the expected linear dependence of @xmath37 with @xmath68 , which itself varies like @xmath69 for the bl and @xmath70 for the ml . </S>",
    "<S> this stems from the fact that in both samples the conductance varies linearly in @xmath71 within logarithmic corrections @xcite , and that @xmath52 is independent of @xmath15 for the bl and varies like @xmath72 for the ml . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath73 is expected to vary like @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as observed respectively for the bl and ml . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical factors may be explained by the samples aspect ratios , but more theory is needed to assess this point .     in a semi - log scale . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath76 is extracted from the exponential fit at small @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( d ) : @xmath78 for the ml and bl . </S>",
    "<S> continuous lines are @xmath79 , with @xmath68 determined from previous magnetoresistance measurements ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) : @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> continuous lines are @xmath81 for the ml and @xmath82 for the bl , with @xmath68 similarly determined . </S>",
    "<S> vertical error bars represent uncertainty in fit parameters , and horizontal bars the 3 v range used to calculate correlation energies . </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    we now discuss the cf amplitude . as is visible in figures [ fig1]b and [ fig1]d , the @xmath15-dependent cf are greater near the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantified by the fluctuation amplitude @xmath29 plotted as a function of @xmath15 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath28-dependent fluctuations do not significantly depend on the density @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this non ergodicity of the fluctuations in graphene may be a consequence of the spatial inhomogeneities of @xmath0 close to the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in a good conductor ( large g ) , changing the fermi energy is equivalent to changing the disorder configuration , and induces cf of order @xmath1 . in graphene on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that near the cnp the system breaks into conducting puddles of electrons and holes , and that transport takes place along an intricate percolating network of these n and p - type regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as pointed out in @xcite , the change in configuration induced by a change of @xmath15 in this region may induce a much larger variation of conductance than a change in the disorder configuration in a good conductor . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the magnetic field does not affect the network but only the phases of the wave functions , which explains why the fluctuations with b are independent of gate voltage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that these results are in contradiction with those of @xcite who found a smaller cf amplitude close to the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be due to a different nature of disorder in the samples @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> -dependent fluctuations ( filled symbols ) are larger near the cnp for both the ml and bl ( panels c and d ) . </S>",
    "<S> error bars are the standard deviation of the difference of two different sweeps . dashed lines are guides for the eyes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15-dependent fluctuation amplitude changes with @xmath15 in a qualitatively similar way as the resistance . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28-dependent cf amplitude ( open triangles ) does nt change much with @xmath15.,width=340 ]    for the ml , we find the @xmath28-dependent cf amplitude to be @xmath83 , independent of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> theory @xcite predicts @xmath84 when the distance between electrodes l is smaller than @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath86 for the ml , which is three times the value measured in this work ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to second - order non - linear cf in monolayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in the introduction , current through a mesoscopic sample induces charge accumulation around impurities and sample edges . </S>",
    "<S> this bias induced change of electronic density @xmath87 modifies ( via coulomb interactions ) the electrostatic potential landscape throughout the sample by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 quantifies e - e interactions @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> cf acquire a non linear bias dependent contribution : @xmath90+\\delta g[\\delta u_{dis}(\\gamma_{int},v)]$ ] , where @xmath91 is the potential in zero bias . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath92 is the linear conductance , and @xmath93/\\partial v)_{v=0}$ ] is the second order conductance . in a magnetic field @xmath28 , @xmath87 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 contain a component which is even , as well as another which is odd in @xmath28 , which can be viewed as a mesoscopic hall voltage . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to @xmath27 which is even in @xmath28 , in the presence of interactions @xmath94 has a component which is odd in @xmath28 , @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between the even ( symmetric ) variance @xmath96 and the odd ( antisymmetric ) variance @xmath97 of @xmath98 is predicted to be independent of conductance in ballistic systems , but in diffusive systems it should vary like @xmath99 , with g the conductance in units of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4 ] shows @xmath100 and @xmath95 at two different carrier densities ( close and far from the cnp ) , as well as the ratio of the odd to even amplitude @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath102 significantly decreases as carrier density increases , in contrast to ballistic gaas / gaalas rings @xcite , where @xmath102 was nearly independent of the dimensionless conductance @xmath103 .     </S>",
    "<S> is largest at the cnp . </S>",
    "<S> ( c)the ratio @xmath104 is compared to @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> error bars are deduced from the difference of @xmath106 between two consecutive scans , which is mainly due to telegraphic noise in the sample.,width=264 ]    to compare to the predictions for diffusive systems , @xmath107 , we plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c @xmath108 , and find that @xmath109 . according to @xcite , the interaction constant @xmath89 is related to the geometrical capacitance @xmath17 and electro chemical capacitance @xmath110 by @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath112 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perfect screening ( in materials with large densities of states ) corresponds to @xmath113 , and no screening to @xmath114 . in graphene @xmath115 over the entire @xmath0 range investigated , within less than @xmath116 : screening is strong , even close to the cnp where @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath118 , compared to @xmath119 expected for @xmath120 , may be due to the large aspect ratio @xmath121 of the sample , which is known to increase @xmath29 entering in the calculation of @xmath102 @xcite , but there are no calculations for our geometry . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that mesoscopic graphene samples exhibit conductance fluctuations which fermi energy- and @xmath122dependent correlation functions can be described by theoretical predictions for diffusive systems over a wide range of carrier concentration , for both monolayer and bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the different behaviors of the correlation energy and fields are intimately related to the fundamentally different dispersion relations of both systems . </S>",
    "<S> a significant increase of the amplitude of the fermi energy - dependent fluctuations is observed close to the neutrality point , whereas the @xmath28-dependent fluctuation amplitude is nearly constant over the entire carrier density range . </S>",
    "<S> this non - ergodicity of fluctuations may be attributed to the particular disorder due to electron and hole puddles in graphene near the charge neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have measured the second order non - linear conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we have exploited the tunability of graphene s conductance to find that its field asymmetry decreases with g , in agreement with theoretical predictions for diffusive systems . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates strongly screened electron - electron interactions in graphene . </S>"
