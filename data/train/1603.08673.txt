    "the realization that planetary systems can harbor hot gas giants led to drastic revisions to both theories of planet formation and dynamical evolution .",

    "though much effort has been spent testing these theories they all remain viable , at least for some systems ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the core reason is that diagnostics ( e.g. the period - eccentricity distribution ) are muddled by the wide and often unknown ages of host stars in field star exoplanetary systems .",
    "a direct solution would be to find young exoplanets with ages @xmath01  myr , however the extreme activity of host stars at t tauri ages has thus far inhibited detecting planets ( e.g. @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; some very young candidates nevertheless remain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one system discovered in the hyades is noteworthy for its distinctly non - zero eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) , which implies that dynamical scattering has likely played a role in its dynamical evolution , at least in the late stages of the process @xcite .",
    "it is already clear that even a few hot gas giant exoplanets in open clusters with precise ages have the potential to strongly constrain planet - migration theories .",
    "any such systems that also happen to be transiting will produce even more powerful constraints on gas giant formation models by revealing precise information on the sizes , densities and compositions of exoplanets with well - determined ages .",

    "more than 600 systems have been studied using rv techniques . in contrast",

    "the deficiency of known exoplanets in clusters is not a consequence of higher stellar rv jitter .",
    "measured values of this in open clusters are @xmath10 m / s at @xmath11 myr @xcite , which is roughly an order of magnitude less than the amplitude induced by a typical hot gas giant .",

    "individual spectra , one star at a time  is typical of cluster surveys .",
    "lengthy campaigns involving thousands of visits are needed to find the comparatively rare cases with detectable velocity amplitudes : only @xmath12% of all fgk stars in the solar neighborhood harbor hot gas giants @xcite and cluster occurrence rates appear similar @xcite so hundreds of targets must be monitored .",
    "the marvels survey @xcite is a notable exception to this with its @xmath011,000 stars and is intended to attain similar rv precision to the work we report here though it is not targeted to clusters .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a different approach that employs highly - multiplexed rv techniques to detect and study exoplanetary systems containing hot gas giants down to @xmath13 that are orbiting stars in clusters that range in age from about 100 myr to nearly 1 gyr . to our knowledge",
    "our survey is the first multi - object spectroscopic survey of open cluster stars to obtain rv precisions at the sub - hundred m / s level . to do this ,",
    "we have used spectra obtained with the michigan / magellan fiber system ( m2fs ; * ? ? ? * ) which allows us to obtain multiplexed , high - resolution ( r @xmath14 ) optical spectra of solar - analogue stars ( spectra types f5v to k5v ) in nearby ( @xmath151  kpc ) clusters .",

    "we expect our precision to remain better than @xmath075  m / s for stars as faint as @xmath16 . though our precision is not particularly notable when compared with e.g. the 0.3  m / s precision of harps @xcite or similar instruments , it is comparable to the expected performance of marvels and our magnitude limit is significantly beyond the survey s v=12 limit .",
    "harps is capable of 30  m / s precision at @xmath17 but it requires @xmath01  hour exposure  4000 times less efficient than our multi - object approach .",

    "the fibers accept light from the sky at the f/11 nasmyth e focal surface of the magellan / clay 6.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "each fiber samples the sky through a 1.2 arcsecond aperture ; fibers can be packed to within 14 arcseconds of one another with no restrictions within the m2fs field of view and are held in place by plug plates drilled in advance of an observing run using astrometry for the desired targets .",

    "m2fs incorporates a slit mechanism placed just after the ends of the fibers at the spectrograph collimator / camera focal surface ; details of this mechanism are provided in @xcite . for all of the hires observations used in this paper , we employed the 45-micron wide slit ( the narrowest available ) which projects to approximately three pixels at the detectors . for this configuration we found an effective resolution of in 40 - 60k range for most fibers ( c.f figure  [ slitlampimage ] ) , subject to focus variations . because the slits are positioned after the fibers we sacrifice roughly 60% of the incident light .        for this study",
    ", we employed a two order filter with a design passband of 70507370     ( m2fs echelle orders 49 and 50 ) : the use of a filter is necessary to prevent spectral orders from one fiber overlapping with those of another and a two order filter limits us to every second m2fs fiber for a multiplexing factor of 128 . as few target clusters would offer more than about 100 targets in a single m2fs field this decision does not appreciably affect our multiplexing capability .",
    "the passband was selected after careful consideration of the optimal wavelength region to carry out telluric - reference rv measurements of solar analogue stars .",
    "we used the formalism of @xcite combined with synthetic spectra from the phoenix grid @xcite to estimate the rv uncertainties for slowly - rotating , main - sequence stars with effective temperatures between 4000 and 7000 k for a range of m2fs orders red - ward of about 6800 (where telluric features become common ) .",
    "this uncertainty was then added in quadrature with the wavelength reference uncertainty in each order determined by applying the same formalism to the telluric absorption features present in the empirical telluric spectrum from @xcite .",
    "results of this analysis are shown in figure  [ precisionfig ] : we show our estimates of attainable velocity precision for sun - like , slowly rotating stars observed at two fiducial resolving powers and",

    "in practice we only obtain useful data from the first portion of order 49 ( 71607290   ) .",
    "our filter was manufactured prior to the discovery of a slight difference in the intended and manufactured echelle grating blaze .",
    "this rendered data from order 50 to be of little use , truncated the redder portion of order 49 , and limited system throughput by a factor of two ( see figure  [ throughputfig ] ) .",

    "we anticipate this will improve our achievable velocity precision by @xmath015% where we are not limited by systematics and do not anticipate any negative impact on our program .",
    "[ filterissuesec ]      since we were looking for radial velocity variations among stars in clusters that might harbor exoplanetary systems , our observing procedure involved repeat observations of our target fields ( table  [ targtable1 ] ) with m2fs . to date , we have observed our pointings in ngc  2516 and ngc  2422 12 and 10 times , respectively .",
    "we also obtained 35 observations of our principle rv standard hip  48331 along with a small number of observations of the other comparison standards ( table  [ stdtargtable ] ) .",
    "the specific dates of the observations will be summarized in a later paper describing our time - series spectroscopy ; for the purposes of the present paper we simply note that the data were obtained during runs in november 2013 , february 2014 and december 2014 .",
    "as noted earlier , fibers are positioned at the focal surface of the telescope with m2fs using aluminum plug plates that are manually installed and plugged . for a given field",
    ", each assigned fiber is positioned at a specific hole in the plate marked for that fiber .",
    "we typically deployed 128 fibers for the ngc  2516 and ngc  2422 fields , though with dead or otherwise inactive fibers excluded .",
    "once plugged , a typical observation then consists of acquiring the field using a set of ancillary fibers and imaging optics aligned to reference stars in each field .",
    "typical total exposure times for each observation used in this paper were 2 hrs and 2.5 hrs per visit for ngc  2516 and ngc  2422 , respectively .",
    "most visits consisted of 3 - 5 individual exposures to aid in cosmic - ray removal and to enable measurement of the photon midpoint for barycentric correction .",
    "this yielded a median s / n of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 range 15 - 70 ) per 1d extracted pixel ( @xmath45 per resolution element ) .",
    "a detailed table of our individual observations and the targets therein will be presented in our next paper . for each observation",
    "we obtain calibration data consisting of a thorium - argon - neon lamp exposure and a quartz lamp exposure either before or following the science frame . on some nights",
    "during which our targets were observed we also obtain either evening or morning twilight spectra .",
    "rv standard observations are performed by placing a single fiber in a standard hole on the fiber plug plate and offsetting from the field center .",
    "remaining fibers are left in their positions and see only sky .",
    "typically three exposures of two minutes each are used to obtain a spectrum of s / n@xmath46 per extracted 1d pixel .",
    "finally we obtained four epochs ( 1 or 2 per observing run ) of the telluric standard calibration field in ngc  2516 .",
    "these spectra have a median s / n of 160 and were obtained in 3 to 5 exposures totaling roughly one half hour .",
    "basic data reduction follows a mostly traditional path using a custom set of python tools written for m2fs .",
    "the quadrant images produced by the ccd s four amplifiers were bias corrected by subtracting the median overscan column and then row .",
    "we then converted counts to electrons and used the python implementation of the l.a .",
    "cosmic algorithm @xcite to detect cosmic rays : this algorithm takes the laplacian of the image and identifies cosmic rays using their steep intensity gradient . the quadrants were then packed together and stored with a variance frame consisting of electrons plus the square of each quadrant s read noise and a bad - pixel mask .",
    "we created a cleaned , summed image by adding the electrons and variances of each pixel across a sequence of frames .",
    "masked pixels in each component frame were repaired with their expectation value based on the other frames .",
    "a scaling value was computed for each frame to normalize throughput and exposure time variations by using the total time - normalized counts of all spectra as a proxy for throughput variability .",
    "bad pixels in each frame were then repaired using the expectation value determined from the good pixels in other frames and the frame scaling values .",
    "the variance of the final , summed pixel was inflated appropriately at every impacted pixel .",
    "typically one would flat - field the resulting frames , however quartz trace flats of comparable signal - to - noise take an impractical amount of observing time and m2fs does not presently have a means of obtaining uniformly illuminated ccd frames .",
    "engineering work shows m2fs ccds are free from large defects and indicate pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations of about 1.7% and only 0.25% of pixels are significantly hot or cold .",
    "we subtracted a combined dark current and scattered light map , an example of which is shown in figure  [ exampleim ] along with the image prior to and post subtraction .",
    "this map was computed by first modeling and removing the amplifier glow in each corner by fitting a 2d gaussian surface .",
    "all remaining pixels within about a standard deviation of the mean light level in the dark regions between bundles of 16 fibers were then selected as `` scattered light '' pixels and used to fit polynomials across the image .",
    "the resulting map was gaussian smoothed using a 32 x 64 pixel rectangle ( @xmath0 1.5 x 3 fiber spacings ) and subtracted from the image . without this step , these components would amount to about 150 @xmath47 per 1d pixel in our extracted spectra , ranging from @xmath48 of our extracted signal for our brightest to faintest targets .",
    "each processed frame was then extracted using the pyraf task ` apall ` .",
    "we first identified the approximate aperture locations and traces using dome flats taken during the day with all usable fibers plugged .",
    "the apertures were then median shifted to the locations of the quartz traces taken with each exposure to account for any temperature drift or repositioning errors in the instrument .",
    "we then extracted both the science and variance frames without variance weighting using identical apertures .",
    "finally we continuum normalized the spectra by iteratively fitting a polynomial , each time excluding points 1 sigma below or 2 sigma above .",
    "an example of order 49 for a @xmath49 f5v , g5v , & k5v star in our sample is shown in figure  [ exampleextractions ] .",
    "we do not wavelength calibrate our spectra in a traditional sense as wavelengths are determined as part of the modeling process .",
    "we measured each target s stellar properties ( e.g. @xmath1 , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath3/fe ] , @xmath5 ) and line - of - sight radial velocity ( rv ) by fitting a model of each extracted , normalized spectrum to the spectrum in 1d pixel space .",
    "this approach is similar to the popular gas cell approach where molecular absorption lines from a well - calibrated gas cell ( e.g. @xmath50 , ammonia ) are used as a simultaneous probe of pixel wavelengths and the instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) . here",

    "though once unexpected , it is now clear that a great many hot - gas giants exist . assuming 1.2% of f5-k5 stars in open clusters harbor hot gas planets ( p @xmath212 days , @xmath213 ) @xcite and given our achieved precision we can predict the limits of our technique . for example",
    ", we expect m2fs will be capable of attaining a s / n 25 spectrum of a k5v star at a dm of 9.5 in 4 hours ( effectively 2 minutes per star )",
    ". this would be sufficient for an rv precision of  @xmath43 m / s , with brighter members increasingly limited by the systematics in our analysis . in this hypothetical cluster",
    "we would then be sensitive to @xmath214% of known hot gas giants .",
    "figure  [ precisiondm ] shows our anticipated rv measurement precision as a function of distance modulus using the new filter .",
    "this implies we could reasonably expect one hot - jupiter per m2fs pointing , provided targets are available for the majority of fibers .",
    "table  [ futuretargtable ] lists the eight nearby open clusters that matched the cluster selection criteria given in section  [ targselecsec ] . from these clusters",
    "we can obtain @xmath10 m2fs pointings and would expect about as many exoplanet candidates .",
    "we highlight that these clusters span a range of ages and are thus well suited to help build a sample of exoplanets that addresses the formation and migration issues discussed in the introduction .",
    "this program would also well characterize the doppler uncertainty commonly referred to as stellar jitter as a function of age .",
    "this issue is not yet well constrained ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the present state of our knowledge is largely summarized in figure  [ agejitter ] , which shows the stellar jitter as a function of age for a young association and two open clusters along with the ages of open clusters our expanded survey will target .",
    "extant data is far from homogenous ",
    "a mix of both optical and infrared spectroscopy  and suffers from rather small sample sizes . by surveying a large number of stars in clusters over a range of ages we will well constrain this effect with age and determine what truly constitutes `` too young '' to measure precision rvs .",
    "we note that m2fs s strength is in identification : though the ability to survey large numbers of stars at this precision is unmatched , we would suggest that followup of promising candidates is better suited to traditional monitoring programs .",
    "the success of any large scale rv survey of open clusters for planets depends critically on having a carefully vetted sample to survey .",
    "m2fs is poised to do this .",
    "first , precision rvs will help confirm membership , especially when combined with gaia proper motions .",
    "second , precision rvs can identify spectroscopic binaries that are typically poor targets for exoplanet searches .",
    "finally , the high dispersion spectra allow measures of @xmath5 , @xmath1 , and metallicity , with the latter two yielding stellar masses from evolutionary models . when coupled with photometric periods determined by lsst",
    ", we could even determine stellar inclinations and identify edge - on systems .",
    "the flexible nature of m2fs also means that we could also obtain spectra of the ca  ii h and k region for all of our targets with a relatively modest overhead ( @xmath215 min total for targets in ngc  2516 and ngc  2422 ) , further helping calibrate stellar ages .",
    "a number of recent papers have also highlighted the importance both stellar multiplicity and metallicity play in star formation and have drawn attention to various gaps in current simulations of cluster evolution @xcite .",
    "our stellar properties directly address such gaps by characterizing the cluster chemical environment while our rvs allow robust identification of binaries and brown dwarfs ( constrained by our time baseline ) , characterizing the kinematic environment .",
    "such a dataset can contribute to the initial conditions used in dynamical simulations of cluster formation .",
    "we also note there is an absence of precision internal kinematics for open clusters .",
    "this dataset is useful to study the internal dynamics of open clusters at the 10 m / s level . with an anticipated precision of better than 10 @xmath216as / yr ( @xmath217 20 m / s at 500 pc ) @xcite , once gaia data is available for our targets",
    "the combined dataset will offer an unprecedented 3d kinematic picture of stars within open clusters , providing a useful tool to study internal kinematics .",
    "we have presented a program to use the michigan / magellan fiber system to obtain multiplexed spectroscopy of solar analog stars in nearby ( @xmath2181 kpc ) open clusters with the intent of identifying exoplanet host stars for subsequent followup .",
    "our technique uses telluric lines in the 7230   region as a wavelength reference and is presently capable of measuring rvs with a precision of 25 - 60 m / s , depending on s / n .",
    "we also obtain precise and accurate measurements of @xmath1 , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath3/fe ] , and @xmath5 for all of our target stars thereby enabling characterization of the cluster environment .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of papers on our efforts and described our analysis procedure in detail .",
    "the next paper in this series will report the rvs and stellar parameters of targets in ngc  2422 and ngc  2516 and carry out an analysis of the companion detectability therein .",
    "later papers will use our sample to study binaries in our sample and analyze emergent cluster properties .",
