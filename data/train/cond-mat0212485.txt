    "computational physicists often face to problems of calculating the linear response functions or the real - time green s functions of quantum manybody systems with degree of freedom @xmath2 or more .",
    "direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix is the most naive and powerful method for modest system size @xmath3 .",
    "however , it becomes prohibitive for larger system because the computational time grows as @xmath4 .",
    "therefore efficient numerical algorithms , such as quantum monte carlo methods , lanczos methods , and kernel polynomial methods have been developed and applied to various problems .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods@xcite can generate the green s functions of very large systems since qmc does not need to store the wave functions .",
    "they have been successfully used for evaluating the imaginary - time green s functions and , therefore , various thermodynamic quantities . however , for evaluating dynamical quantities such as ac conductivity , one has to rely on numerical analytic continuation ( e.g. _ maximum entropy method _",
    "@xcite ) to obtain the real - time green s function from the imaginary - time one .",
    "this procedure is not straightforward because the statistical errors are amplified by numerical analytical continuation and the default model for the mem must be assumed _ a priori_.    lanczos methods@xcite have been useful techniques for evaluating dynamical responses of relatively large systems .",
    "the lm uses lanczos recursion formula with matrix vector multiplications ( @xmath5 ) to tridiagonalize the hamiltonian matrix , which leads to a continued fraction representation of the real - time green s function .",
    "the drawback of lm is numerical instability of lanczos recursion formula caused by accumulation of roundoff errors for large numbers of mvm s .",
    "recently , lm was extended to finite temperatures ( finite temperature lm ) by introducing random sampling over the ground and excited eigenstates @xcite . however , ftlm has a weak point that the number of excited eigenstates to be calculated increases rapidly as temperature or system size becomes large",
    ". therefore reduction of computational costs by exploiting symmetries of the system becomes crucial .",
    "kernel polynomial method @xcite calculates density of states and linear response functions by using chebyshev polynomial expansion @xcite of broadened delta functions .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials are obtained through chebyshev recursion formula by using mvm s . unlike lanczos recursion",
    ", chebyshev recursion avoids accumulation of numerical roundoff errors even for large numbers of mvm s .",
    "the use of kpm for linear response functions has been limited to the ground state calculation .",
    "fermi - weighted time - dependent method @xcite is a combination of conventional time - dependent method @xcite , random vector representation of trace @xcite , and chebyshev polynomial expansion of step function @xmath6 to extract occupied and unoccupied one - particle states of noninteracting fermi particles in the ground state .",
    "this method was successfully applied to optical absorption of silicon nano - crystallites@xcite .",
    "our new algorithm , the boltzmann - weighted time - dependent method , calculates linear response functions at finite temperatures by using the boltzmann - weight operator in place of the fermi - weight operator .",
    "the bwtdm has an advantage to ftlm that the computational time does not increase as temperature increases , because bwtdm does not calculate any eigenstates at all .",
    "therefore bwtdm does not need use of symmetries and can easily treat disordered systems .    in this letter",
    ", we introduce bwtdm and apply it to study electron spin resonance spectrum of one - dimensional @xmath1 antiferromagnet cu benzoate @xmath7 , especially the dynamical crossover between _ spinon _ excitation and _ breather _ excitation as a function of temperature .",
    "nonperturbative analytical calculation of this phenomena is a very difficult problem which still open . even within sine gordon theory ,",
    "the linear response functions have been studied only at high temperature regime ( by perturbation ) and at zero temperature .",
    "we compare our numerical results with preceding experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of one - dimensional @xmath1 antiferromagnet cu benzoate may be written @xcite as @xmath8.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet where @xmath9 is spin operator at the @xmath10-th site , @xmath11 is the exchange interaction @xcite , and the sums are taken over @xmath12 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the second is the normal zeeman term due to the external uniform magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "the third is the staggered zeeman term due to induced staggered magnetic field @xmath14 originating from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction and the staggered component of the @xmath15 tensor@xcite . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath16 with @xmath13 along @xmath17(@xmath18)-direction .",
    "unit of magnetic field and frequency become @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .    according to the linear response theory , absorption of electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath22 and polarization @xmath23",
    "is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves and @xmath26 is the imaginary part of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility , @xmath27 at inverse temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the correlation function is defined by @xmath29 / \\mathrm{tr } \\left [ e^{-\\beta h } \\right]\\ ] ] where the magnetization operator is @xmath30",
    "the essence of bwtdm is evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation ] ) by using _ boltzmann - weighted random vectors _ , @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the above equation , the _ uniform random vector _ , @xmath33 ,",

    "( [ eq : statis ] ) .",
    "the boltzmann operator is evaluated by the chebyshev polynomial expansion @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the coefficient of the chebyshev polynomial expansion , and @xmath44 is an arbitrary vector .",
    "the chebyshev polynomial of k - th order @xmath45 is calculated by the chebyshev recursion formula,@xmath46 the time - evolution operator @xmath47 can be evaluated with numerical stability by the leap frog method @xcite , @xmath48    in real calculation , we first generate @xmath49 complex random numbers @xmath36 and construct @xmath50 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : randomvec ] ) .",
    "the @xmath51 can be computed with numerical stability by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : cheby ] ) repeatedly to @xmath50",
    ". then @xmath52 gives a sample of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation2 ] ) . here",
    ", we introduce another vector @xmath53 and calculate the time evolution of @xmath51 and @xmath54 by eq.([eq : frog ] ) . at each time",
    "@xmath55 , the matrix element @xmath56 gives a sample of numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation2 ] ) . after calculating the denominator and numerator for @xmath57 random vectors",
    ", the ratio of their averages gives @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation2 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath26 with a finite frequency resolution @xmath59 is calculated by using gaussian filter , @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is related to @xmath59 by @xmath62 . in order to avoid finite size effect of spinon excitations ,",
    "@xmath61 is chosen so that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spin wave velocity @xcite .",
    "this limits the finest frequency resolution .",
    "note that this is not the limit due to the algorithm but due to the finite size model .",
    "much finer resolution can be used for breather modes , which are spatially localized .",
    "two more numerical details : first , the fluctuation in the result is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of eigenstates participating in @xmath51 multiplied by @xmath57@xcite",
    ". therefore systems at lower temperatures require more random vectors for the same quality of the result .",
    "second , since the chebyshev polynomials are defined only in the range @xmath65 $ ] , the hamiltonian should be rescaled when eq .",
    "( [ eq : cheby ] ) is applied , so that all eigenvalues of @xmath66 lie in the range @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the esr spectra of normal polarization ( faraday configuration ) @xmath67 calculated with various temperatures , and fig .",
    "2 shows the width and peak frequency of the spinon excitation @xmath68 and the first breather excitation @xmath69 obtained by fitting two gaussian peaks to the calculated spectra with the least square method . at high temperatures ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "@xmath68 is outstanding in the spectrum , and its peak shifts to higher frequency and becomes broadened as temperature decreases while @xmath69 becomes narrower . at low temperatures ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath69 prevails while its peak frequency is almost constant and its width becomes much smaller than the numerical resolution @xmath59 .",
    "this crossover behavior between spinon excitation and first breather excitation has become computable by the invention of bwtdm , and the result is consistent with both experimental @xcite and field - theoretical results @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can observe in fig.2 the shift of @xmath69 at high temperatures and the narrowing of @xmath68 at low temperatures .",
    "we believe these tendencies are real physics but not numerical artifact though further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary to confirm it .",
    "several other weak peaks appear in our results as well as in experimental results , which are supposed to be higher - order breathers and transitions between excited states .",
    "however , we are not going to analyze them here .",
    "figure 3 shows the induced energy gap @xmath72 calculated from the @xmath69 frequency @xmath22 by solving @xcite @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath72 scales to @xmath75 as predicted by oshikawa and affleck@xcite . for @xmath76",
    ", our result seems to deviate from the @xmath75-scaling and have a dip around @xmath77 .",
    "this seems consistent with the experimental results and the density - matrix renormalization - group study @xcite .",
    "at such a high field , assumption of sine gordon theory , that the @xmath13 is weak and the frequency is small , is probably broken . since the gap is calculated as a small difference of two large numbers , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the agreement of our result with the experimental value and the @xmath75-scaling at low fields demonstrates the numerical accuracy of our algorithm .    in summary , we developed an efficient and stable algorithm for linear response functions at finite temperatures , and studied the esr spectra of @xmath1 antiferromagnet cu benzoate for a wide range of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "we reproduced experimental results of the spinon - breather crossover as a function of temperature .",
    "temperature dependence of the width and shift of the peaks are also calculated , which are consistent with experiments and analytical theories .",
    "the calculated frequency of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath13 agrees well with both experimental and field - theoretical results at low fields , and reproduces the deviation of experimental results from the sine gordon theory at high fields , where the low energy assumption of the sine gordon theory may be broken and the choice of the compactification radius @xmath80 becomes ambiguous@xcite .",
    "the advantage of bwtdm is being applicable to finite temperatures , strong magnetic field and high frequency while its weak point is finite size effects ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the computational cost of bwtdm is moderate .",
    "calculation of one curve in fig .  1 , for example , requires approximately 30 minutes with 8 cpu s of fujitsu vpp5000 vector - parallel computer .",
    "we hope that this algorithm stimulates further numerical investigation of dynamical properties of quantum manybody systems at finite temperatures in general .",
