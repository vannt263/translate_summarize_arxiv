    "different methods and data sets are being used to reconstruct the dark energy ( de ) equation of state @xmath2 and thereby also to test the concordance model ( which has @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results vary significantly according to the methods and data sets used , and the error bars and uncertainties are large .",
    "it is clear that higher - precision data are needed for an effective reconstruction and for robust testing of models .",
    "but just as important , more effort is needed to improve the statistical methods and the design of observational tests . in particular , there is a need for effective model - independent statistical methods and for tests that target the concordance model .",
    "one of the most direct ways to reconstruct @xmath4 is via supernovae ( snia ) observations that give the luminosity distance @xmath5 .",
    "model - independent approaches to reconstructing @xmath4 have been developed @xcite .",
    "snia observations lead indirectly to @xmath0 via the derivative @xmath6 .",
    "then we need the second derivative of @xmath7 to reconstruct @xmath4 .",
    "this is very challenging for any reconstruction technique since any noise on the measured @xmath7 will be magnified in the derivatives .",
    "the problem can be lessened if direct @xmath0 data are used because only the first derivative needs to be calculated to determine @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on observations that directly give @xmath0 . presently ,",
    "this may be derived from differential ages of galaxies ( ` cosmic chronometers ' ) and from the radial baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale in the galaxy distribution .",
    "compared to snia observations , less @xmath0 observational data are needed to reconstruct @xmath4 with the same accuracy . for the cosmic chronometer data ,",
    "it has been estimated @xcite that 64 data points with the accuracy of the measurements in @xcite are needed to achieve the same reconstruction accuracy as from the constitution snia data @xcite .",
    "we use a model - independent method for smoothing @xmath0 data to also perform consistency tests of the concordance model ( flat @xmath1cdm ) and of curved @xmath1cdm models .",
    "these consistency tests are formulated as functions of @xmath0 and its derivatives which are constant or zero in @xmath1cdm , independently of the parameters of the model ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "deviations from a constant function indicate problems with our assumptions about dark energy , theory of gravity , or perhaps something else , but without the usual problems of postulating an alternative to @xmath1cdm .",
    "some of the tests we use here are given for the first time .",
    "gaussian processes ( gp ) provide a model - independent smoothing technique that can meet the challenges of reconstructing derivatives from data @xcite .",
    "we follow the same gp approach that has been applied to supernova data in a previous work @xcite by some of the authors of this paper .",

    "these difficulties reflect the fact that we can not use data to construct physical models   rather , we need to use data to test physical models",
    ". the @xmath1cdm model could be tested by looking for deviations from @xmath3 . however , there is a more focused approach : to develop null hypotheses for @xmath1cdm , independently of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .    to test the concordance model",
    "i.e. flat @xmath1cdm  we can use to define a diagnostic function of redshift @xcite : @xmath14 then @xmath15 if @xmath16 is not a constant , this is a signal of an alternative dark energy or modified gravity model .",
    "given observed @xmath11 data , we can estimate confidence limits for @xmath17 .",
    "if these are not consistent with a constant value , we can rule out the concordance model .",
    "it is more effective to measure deviations from zero than from a constant .",
    "the more effective diagnostic is thus the vanishing of the derivative @xmath18 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath19 , where @xcite @xmath20 the null test is therefore @xmath21 to apply this test , we need to reconstruct @xmath22 from the data .",
    "if the concordance model is ruled out , it is still possible that a curved @xmath1cdm model describes the universe . equations and ( with @xmath3 ) form a linear system for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . solving for these parameters we can define @xmath23 and we have @xmath24 these quantities are equivalent to those derived in @xcite in terms of @xmath25 , the dimensionless comoving luminosity distance .",
    "the @xmath25 forms contain second derivatives @xmath26 whereas the @xmath11 forms above contain only first derivatives @xmath27 .",
    "given observed hubble rate data from which we can estimate the derivative @xmath22 , we can then estimate confidence limits for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if these are not consistent with a constant value , we can rule out @xmath1cdm in general , and conclude that dark energy has @xmath30 ( or there is modified gravity ) .",
    "the more effective diagnostic of these consistency tests is the vanishing of the derivatives of and .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 then @xmath34 the vanishing of @xmath35 does not give any independent information ",
    "it is also equivalent to @xmath32 .",
    "given observations of @xmath11 , we can construct this function independently of the parameters of the model and test @xmath1cdm by measuring consistency with zero .",
    "this has the advantage that it is easier to detect deviations from zero rather than a constant , but at the expense of requiring an extra derivative in the observable .",
    "this is akin to detecting deviations from constant in @xmath4 , but without reliance on the parameters of the model .    for the application of these consistency tests , it is crucial to use a model - independent method to reconstruct @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "model - dependent approaches have the problem that they affect or even determine the outcome of the consistency test : while fitting a @xmath1cdm model to the data would always lead to a result that is consistent with @xmath1cdm , fitting a model that does not include @xmath1cdm as a special case would result in inconsistencies with @xmath1cdm .",
    "the only model - dependent approches that do not entirely determine the outcome of the test are those assuming a model which includes @xmath1cdm as a special case . nevertheless , they affect the result by forcing the data into a specific parametrisation , which might not reflect the true model . the only way to avoid this problem is to use a non - parametric approach . here",
