    "rapid growth in the use of wireless services coupled with inefficient utilization of scarce spectrum resources has led to much interest in the analysis and development of cognitive radio systems .",
    "hence , performance analysis of cognitive radio systems is conducted in numerous studies to gain more insights into their potential uses . in most of the previous work ,",
    "transmission rate is considered as the main performance metric .",
    "for instance , the secondary user mean capacity was studied in @xcite by imposing a constraint on the signal - to - interference - noise ratio ( sinr ) of the primary receiver and considering different channel side information ( csi ) levels .",
    "the authors in @xcite determined the optimal power allocation strategies that achieve the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity of the cognitive radio channel under various power and interference constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied the optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy to maximize the average throughput in a multiband cognitive radio network .",
    "recently , the work in @xcite proposed generic expressions for the optimal power allocation scheme and the ergodic capacity of a spectrum sharing cognitive radio under different levels of knowledge on the channel between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver and the channel between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver subject to average / peak transmit power constraints and the interference outage constraint .",
    "although transmission rate is a common performance metric considered for secondary users , error rate is another key performance measure to quantify the reliability of cognitive radio transmissions . in this regard ,",
    "several recent studies incorporate error rates in cognitive radio analysis @xcite@xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite characterized the optimal constellation size of @xmath0-qam and the optimal power allocation scheme that maximize the channel capacity of secondary users for a given target bit error rate ( ber ) , interference and peak power constraints .",
    "the work in @xcite mainly focused on the power allocation scheme minimizing the upper bound on the symbol error probability of phase shift keying ( psk ) in multiple antenna transmissions of secondary users .",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed a channel switching algorithm for secondary users by exploiting the multichannel diversity to maximize the received snr at the secondary receiver and evaluated the transmission performance in terms of average symbol error probability .",
    "the optimal antenna selection that minimizes the symbol error probability in underlay cognitive radio systems was investigated in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent work in @xcite analyzed the minimum ber of a cognitive transmission subject to both average transmit power and interference power constraints . in their model , the secondary transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas among which only one antenna that maximizes the weighted difference between the channel gains of transmission link from the secondary transmitter to the secondary receiver and interference link from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver is selected for transmission .",
    "the authors in @xcite obtained a closed - form ber expression under the assumption that the interference limit of the primary receiver is very high . also , the work in @xcite focused on the optimal power allocation that minimizes the average ber subject to peak / average transmit power and peak / average interference power constraints while the interference on the secondary users caused by primary users is omitted .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the opportunistic scheduling in multiuser underlay cognitive radio systems was studied in terms of link reliability .    in the error rate analysis of the above - mentioned studies , channel sensing errors",
    "are not taken into consideration .",
    "practical cognitive radio systems , which employ spectrum sensing mechanisms to learn the channel occupancy by primary users , generally operate under sensing uncertainty arising due to false alarms and miss - detections . for instance , different spectrum sensing methods for gaussian @xcite , @xcite and non - gaussian environments @xcite , @xcite and dynamic spectrum access strategies @xcite have extensively been studied recently in the literature , and as common to all schemes , channel sensing is generally performed with errors and such errors can lead to degradation in the performance .    with this motivation , we in this paper study the symbol error rate performance of cognitive radio transmissions in the presence of imperfect channel sensing decisions .",
    "we assume that secondary users first sense the channel in order to detect the primary user activity before initiating their own transmissions . following channel sensing , secondary users employ two different transmission schemes depending on how they access the licensed channel : sensing - based spectrum sharing ( sss ) and opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) . in the sss scheme @xcite",
    ", cognitive users are allowed to coexist with primary users in the channel as long as they control the interference by adapting the transmission power according to the channel sensing results .",
    "more specifically , secondary users transmit at two different power levels depending on whether the channel is detected as busy or idle . in the osa scheme @xcite ,",
    "cognitive users are allowed to transmit data only when the channel is detected as idle , and hence secondary users exploit only the silent periods in the transmissions of primary users , called as spectrum opportunities . due to the assumption of imperfect channel sensing , two types of sensing errors , namely false alarms and",
    "miss detections , are experienced .",
    "false alarms result in inefficient utilization of the idle channel while miss - detections lead to cognitive users transmission interfering with primary user s signal .",
    "such interference can be limited by imposing interference power constraints .    in our error rate analysis",
    ", we initially formulate the optimal decision rule and error rates for an arbitrary digital modulation scheme .",
    "subsequently , motivated by the requirements to efficiently use the limited spectrum in cognitive radio settings , we concentrate on quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) as it is a bandwidth - efficient modulation format . more specifically , in our analysis , we assume that the cognitive users employ rectangular qam for data transmission , analysis of which , as another benefit , can easily be specialized to obtain results for square qam , pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) , quadrature phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) , and binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) signaling .",
    "in addition to the consideration of sensing errors and relatively general modulation formats , another contribution of this work is the adoption of a gaussian mixture model for the primary user s received faded signals in the error - rate analysis .",
    "the closed - form error rate expressions in aforementioned works @xcite@xcite are obtained when primary user s faded signal at the secondary receiver is assumed to be gaussian distributed . however , in practice , cognitive radio transmissions can be impaired by different types of non - gaussian noise and interference , e.g. , man - made impulsive noise @xcite , narrowband interference caused by the primary user @xcite , primary user s modulated signal @xcite , and co - channel interference from other cognitive radios @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate the error rate performance of cognitive radio transmissions in the presence of primary user s interference which is modeled to have a gaussian mixture probability density function ( pdf ) ( which includes pure gaussian distribution as a special case ) @xcite .",
    "main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows . under the above - mentioned assumptions ,",
    "we first derive , for both sss and osa schemes , the optimal detector structure , and then we present a closed - form expression of the average symbol error probability under constraints on the transmit power and interference . through this analysis , we investigate the impact of imperfect channel sensing ( i.e. , the probabilities of detection and false alarm ) , interference from the primary user , and both transmit power and interference constraints on the error rate performance of cognitive transmissions . also , the performances of sss and osa transmission schemes are compared when primary user s faded signal is modeled to have either a gaussian mixture or a purely gaussian density .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : system_model ] introduces the system model . in section [ sec : general_formulation ] , general formulations for the optimal detection rule and average symbol error probability in the presence of channel sensing errors are provided for sss and osa schemes . in section [ sec : error_rate_qam_pam ] , closed - form average symbol error probability expressions for specific modulation types , i.e. , arbitrary rectangular qam and pam are derived subject to both transmit power and interference constraints under the assumptions of gaussian - mixture - distributed primary user faded signal and imperfect channel sensing decisions .",
    "numerical results are provided and discussed in section [ sec : num_results ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a cognitive radio system consisting of a pair of secondary transmitter - receiver and a pair of primary transmitter - receiver .",
    "the secondary user initially performs channel sensing , which can be modeled as a hypothesis testing problem .",
    "assume that @xmath1 denotes the hypothesis that the primary users are inactive in the channel , and @xmath2 denotes the hypothesis that the primary users are active .",
    "various channel sensing methods , including energy detection , cyclostationary detection , and matched filtering , have been proposed and analyzed in the literature .",
    "regardless of which method is used , one common feature is that errors in the form of miss - detections and false - alarms occur in channel sensing .",
    "the ensuing analysis takes such errors into account and depends on the sensing scheme only through the detection and false - alarm probabilities .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the sensing decisions that the primary users are inactive and active , respectively .",
    "then , the detection and false - alarm probabilities can be expressed respectively as the following conditional probabilities : @xmath5      following channel sensing , the secondary transmitter performs data transmission over a flat - fading channel . in the sss scheme ,",
    "the average transmission power is selected depending on the channel sensing decision .",
    "more specifically , the average transmission power is @xmath6 if primary user activity is detected in the channel ( denoted by the event @xmath4 ) whereas the average power is @xmath7 if no primary user transmissions are sensed ( denoted by the event @xmath3 ) .",
    "we assume that there is a peak constraint on these average power levels , i.e. , we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the peak transmit power limit .",
    "we further impose an average interference constraint in the following form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the detection probability and @xmath12 is the channel fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver .",
    "note that with probability @xmath11 , primary user activity is correctly detected and primary receiver experiences average interference proportional to @xmath13 . on the other hand , with probability @xmath14 ,",
    "miss - detections occur , secondary user transmits with power @xmath7 , and primary receiver experiences average interference proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 can be regarded as a constraint on the average interference inflicted on the primary user primary receivers by replacing the constraint in ( [ eq : interference_power_constraint_sss ] ) with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the channel fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the @xmath19 primary receiver . in this",
    "setting , @xmath16 effectively becomes a constraint on the worst - case average interference . ] .    in the osa scheme ,",
    "no transmission is allowed when the channel is detected as busy and hence , we set @xmath6 = 0 . now with the peak power and average interference constraints , we have @xmath20 which can be combined to write @xmath21    above , we have introduced the average interference constraint . however ,",
    "if the instantaneous value of the fading coefficient @xmath12 is known at the secondary transmitter , then a peak interference constraint in the form @xmath22 for @xmath23 can be imposed .",
    "note that transmission power @xmath7 in an idle - sensed channel is also required to satisfy the interference constraint due to sensing uncertainty ( i.e. , due to the consideration of miss - detection events ) .",
    "hence , a rather strict form of interference control is being addressed under these limitations .",
    "now , including the peak power constraint , we have @xmath24 for @xmath25 ( while keeping @xmath26 in the osa scheme ) . above",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the peak received power limit at the primary receiver .      as a result of channel sensing decisions and the true nature of primary user activity",
    ", we have four possible cases which are described below together with corresponding input - output relationships :    * _ case ( slowromancap1@ ) _ : a busy channel is sensed as busy , denoted by the joint event @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 * _ case ( slowromancap2@ ) _ : a busy channel is sensed as idle , denoted by the joint event @xmath30 . @xmath31 * _ case ( slowromancap3@ ) _ : an idle channel is sensed as busy , denoted by the joint event @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 * _ case ( slowromancap4@ ) _ : an idle channel is sensed as idle , denoted by the joint event @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35    in the above expressions , @xmath36 is the transmitted signal , @xmath37 is the received signal , and @xmath38 denotes zero - mean , circularly - symmetric complex fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver with variance @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the circularly - symmetric complex gaussian noise with mean zero and variance @xmath41 , and hence has the pdf @xmath42 the active primary user s received faded signal at the secondary receiver is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "notice that if the primary users are active and hence the hypothesis @xmath2 is true as in cases ( slowromancap1@ ) and ( slowromancap2@ ) , the secondary receiver experiences interference from the primary user s transmission in the form of @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that @xmath43 has a gaussian mixture distribution , i.e. , its pdf is a weighted sum of @xmath44 complex gaussian distributions with zero mean and variance @xmath45 for @xmath46 : @xmath47 where the weights @xmath48 satisfy @xmath49 with @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",
    "primary user s received faded signal has a gaussian mixture distribution , if we , for instance , have @xmath52 where @xmath53 , which is the channel fading coefficient between the primary transmitter and the secondary receiver , is a circularly symmetric , complex , zero - mean , gaussian random variable , and @xmath54 is the primary user s modulated digital signal .",
    "note that @xmath43 is conditionally gaussian given @xmath54 .",
    "now , assuming that the modulated signal @xmath54 can take @xmath44 different values with prior probabilities given by @xmath48 for @xmath46 , @xmath43 has a gaussian mixture distribution as in ( [ eq : gaussian_mix ] ) . in the case of multiple primary transmitters for which we have",
    "@xmath55 the above argument can easily be extended if all channel fading coefficients @xmath56 are zero - mean gaussian distributed .",
    "gaussian mixture model is generally rich enough to accurately approximate a wide variety of density functions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the applicability of our results can be extended to various other settings in which @xmath43 has a distribution included in this class of densities .",
    "additionally , in the special case of @xmath57 , the gaussian mixture distribution becomes the pure complex gaussian distribution .",
    "hence , the results obtained for the gaussian mixture distribution can readily be specialized to derive those for the gaussian distributed @xmath43 as well .    as observed from the input - output relationships in ( [ eq : received_signal1])([eq : received_signal4 ] ) , when the true state of the primary users is idle , corresponding to the cases ( slowromancap3@ ) and ( slowromancap4@ ) , the additive disturbance is simply the background noise @xmath40 . on the other hand , in cases ( slowromancap1@ ) and ( slowromancap2@ )",
    "in which the channel is actually busy , the additive disturbance becomes @xmath58 whose distribution can be obtained through the convolution of density functions of the background gaussian noise @xmath40 and the primary user s received faded signal @xmath43 . using the result of gaussian convolution of gaussian mixture given by @xcite , the distribution of @xmath59 can be obtained as @xmath60 note that @xmath59 also has a gaussian mixture distribution .",
    "note further that the pdf of @xmath59 can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary components as @xmath61 moreover , the marginal distributions of each component are given by @xmath62 it is easily seen that the pdf of @xmath59 in ( [ eq : gaussian_mix_conv ] ) can not be factorized into the product of the marginal pdf s of its real and imaginary parts @xmath63 , given in ( [ eq : marginal_inphase ] ) and ( [ eq : marginal_quad ] ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , the real and imaginary parts of the additive disturbance @xmath59 are dependent .",
    "when @xmath57 , i.e. , in the case of a pure gaussian distribution , the joint distribution can written as a product of its real and imaginary components since they are independent .",
    "in this section , we present the optimal decision rule and the average symbol error probability for the cognitive radio system in the presence of channel sensing errors .",
    "we provide general formulations applicable to any modulation type under sss and osa schemes .",
    "more specific analysis for arbitrary rectangular qam and pam is conducted in section [ sec : error_rate_qam_pam ] .      in the cognitive radio setting considered in this paper , the optimal maximum _ a posteriori _ probability ( map ) decision rule given the sensing decision @xmath64 and the channel fading coefficient @xmath38 can be formulated for any arbitrary @xmath0-ary digital modulation as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the prior probability of signal constellation point @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 .",

    "note that the sensing decision @xmath64 affects the density function through the power of the transmitted signal @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the conditional probabilities in ( [ eq : cond - prob - yr ] ) can be expressed as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the prior probabilities of the channel being idle and busy , respectively , and the conditional probabilities in the form @xmath77 depend on the channel sensing performance . as discussed in section [ subsec : sensing ] , @xmath78 is the detection probability and @xmath79 is the false alarm probability . from these formulations , we see that the optimal decision rule in general depends on the sensing reliability .",
    "the average symbol error probability ( sep ) for the map decision rule in ( [ eq : map_decision_rule ] ) in the sss scheme can be computed as @xmath80 the above average symbol error probability can further be expressed as in ( [ eq : pe_intdecisionregions ] )    @xmath81 \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ' '' ''    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the decision regions of each signal constellation point @xmath67 for @xmath84 when the channel is sensed to be idle and busy , respectively .",
    "if cognitive user transmission is not allowed in the case of the channel being sensed as occupied by the primary users , we have the osa scheme for which the average probability of error can be expressed as @xmath85",
    "in this section , we conduct a more detailed analysis by considering rectangular qam transmissions to demonstrate the key tradeoffs in a lucid setting . correspondingly , we determine the optimal decision regions by taking channel sensing errors into consideration and identify the error rates for sss and osa schemes .",
    "we derive closed - form minimum average symbol error probability expressions under the transmit power and interference constraints .",
    "note that the results for qam can readily be specialized for pam , qpsk , and bpsk transmissions .",

    "it is assumed that the fading realizations are perfectly known at the receiver . in this case ,",
    "phase rotations caused by the fading can be offset by multiplying the channel output @xmath37 with @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the phase of the fading coefficient @xmath38 .",

    "hence , the optimal detector structure does not depend on the sensing decision .",

    "one additional remark from the figure is that sss scheme gives better error rate performance compared to osa scheme at higher values of @xmath176 .",
    "we have studied the error rate performance of cognitive radio transmissions in both sss and osa schemes in the presence of transmit and interference power constraints , sensing uncertainty , and gaussian mixture distributed interference from primary user transmissions . in this setting , we have proved that the midpoints between the signals are optimal thresholds for the detection of equiprobable rectangular qam signals .",

    "also , better error performance is achieved in the presence of gaussian - mixture distributed @xmath43 in comparison to that achieved when @xmath43 is gaussian distributed with the same variance .",
    "we have also addressed how the error rates and transmission powers vary as a function of the power and interference constraints .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that symbol error probabilities are in general dependent on sensing performance through the detection and false alarm probabilities .",
    "for instance , we have observed that as the detection probability increases , the error rate performance under both schemes improves in interference - limited environments .",
    "similarly , sep is shown to decrease with decreasing false - alarm probability .",
    "hence , we conclude that sensing performance is tightly linked to error performance and improved sensing leads to lower error rates .      since the signals are _",
    "equiprobable _ , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decision rule is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average probability of error @xcite .",
    "since cognitive transmission is allowed only when the channel is sensed as idle under osa scheme , it is enough to evaluate the ml decision rule under sensing decision @xmath3 , which can be expressed as @xmath198 the above decision rule can further be expressed as @xmath199 above maximization simply becomes the comparison of the likelihood functions of the received signals given the transmitted signals @xmath103 . without loss of generality , we consider the signal constellation point @xmath103 .",
    "then , the decision region for the in - phase component of this signal constellation point is given by ( [ eq : comparision_ml1 ] ) .",

    "we note that all the terms on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : comparision_ml3 ] ) other than the terms inside the parentheses are nonnegative .",
    "let us now consider these difference terms .",
