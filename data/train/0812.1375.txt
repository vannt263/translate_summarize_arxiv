    "this work is an extension of our study of singularities of hinge structures @xcite .",
    "we refer to that paper for basic notions and background",
    ".    the hinge structures considered here will be body - and - hinge or panel - and - hinge chains in @xmath0 which have a point marked on the first body and a point marked on the last body . in dimension three , these hinge structures would model serial manipulators with revolute joints with a marked base - point and the end - effector as the other marked point .",
    "likewise , the panel - and - hinge case may serve as model for  backbone \" protein chains @xcite .",
    "extremal configurations will be those where the squared distance function between the two marked points ( origin and terminus , or  head \" and  tail \" ) reaches a local maximum or minimum .",
    "robotics is obviously concerned with extremal reaches of manipulators and the closely related problem of identifying the total workspace of a robot .",
    "a _ necessary _ condition for extremal configurations was recognized and proven in several papers @xcite . in the words of @xcite , where the base - point may be chosen arbitrarily , and the end - point is called  hand \" , this necessary condition says : _  the line of sight from that point to the hand must intersect all turning axes\"_. however , all critical points with non - zero value for the squared distance function satisfy the condition , and they grow exponentially with the number of hinges .    in this paper ,",
    "we refine the study of extremal configurations and obtain , in particular , a very simple _ necessary and sufficient _ characterization of the global maximum . it may be observed here that the approach used to identify the global maximum configuration ( which is unique for generic body - and - hinge chains ) can not be fully adapted for the global minimum , although the panel - and - hinge case offers a fair degree of similarity ( theorems [ maxima ] and [ minima ] ) .",
    "the distinction , we suggest , stems from the possibility to reinterpret the global maximum as a global minimum of a related problem . once recognized , the criterion for the global maximum can be proven with completely elementary means .",
    "* global maximum theorem : *  _ a body - and - hinge chain is in a global maximum configuration if and only if the segment from the origin to the end - point intersects all hinges in their natural order . _    the panel - and - hinge case has sufficient specificity to warrant separate treatment , most particularly in dimension three .",
    "local extrema must be global extrema , but are not unique if not flat .",
    "in the final section we discuss some variations .",
    "in this section we consider body - and - hinge chains with @xmath1 bodies and two marked points , one on the first and the other on the last body .",
    "the ambient dimension will be @xmath2 , and we identify the first body with the fixed reference coordinate system @xmath3 , with the marked point at the origin .",
    "the point on the last body will be the end - point .",
    "the composition of the _ end - point map _ @xmath4 with the _ squared norm _ function @xmath5 gives the _ squared distance function _ of the end - point to the origin :    @xmath6    we ll use @xmath7 as another notation for the @xmath8-torus parametrizing the configuration space of our body - and - hinge chain .",
    "the critical points of @xmath9 are described by :    let @xmath10 .",
    "zero _ is a value of @xmath9 , then all points in @xmath11 are critical points of @xmath9 . the critical points with _ non - zero _ critical values are those configurations which have all hinges ( projectively ) incident with the line connecting the origin to the end - point .    in the generic case , @xmath12 is a morse - bott function , which has only isolated critical points for non - zero critical values , while the fiber over zero @xmath13 , when non - empty , will be smooth , of dimension @xmath14 .    _",
    "proof : _  the squared norm on @xmath0 has a critical point at the origin , hence all configurations with the two marked points coinciding ( i.e. figuratively , when ",
    "the head bites the tail \" ) will be critical for @xmath9 .    for non - zero critical values ,",
    "the argument is similar to the one used in @xcite : at a critical configuration , rotating the part of the chain from hinge @xmath15 on , as a rigid piece , must preserve , infinitesimally , the ( squared ) distance  head - to - tail \" , that is : must produce a velocity vector for the end - point orthogonal to the line between the marked points .",
    "that requires the ( projective ) incidence of hinge and line .    in the generic case",
    ", the origin will be a regular value of the end - point map , and , when zero is a value of @xmath9 , it will give a smooth ( not necessarily connected ) , codimension @xmath2 fiber @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that the remaining critical points are isolated will follow from the examination of the corresponding hessian .",
    "the bott non - degeneracy condition @xcite along ( the connected components of ) @xmath16 will be verified at that stage as well .      in a given configuration ,",
    "hinge number @xmath17 will be determined by the vector @xmath18 which is the perpendicular projection of the origin on the corresponding hinge , plus the normal direction to the hyperplane formed by the hinge and the origin .",
    "one may keep track of global orientations , but for our computations , a local choice of unit normal @xmath19 will suffice . thus @xmath20 ` encodes ' the @xmath21 hinge .    at any critical point",
    ", we may assume the @xmath22 labelling of the configuration space introduced by the following rule : the critical point is @xmath23 , and the position for arbitrary @xmath24 is obtained by rotating the last body around the last hinge with angle @xmath25 , then rotating the last two bodies ( as a rigid piece ) around the last but one hinge with angle @xmath26 , and so on until , at last , the whole ( rigid ) piece thus formed with all the bodies from the second to the last is rotated around the first hinge with angle @xmath27 .",
    "all rotations , for @xmath28 , are using the sense dictated by a fixed orientation , say @xmath29 in the vector plane @xmath30 $ ] they span .",
    "let @xmath31 stand for the _ linear operator in _",
    "@xmath0 which gives the _ rotation _ with angle @xmath32 around @xmath30^{\\perp}$ ] , with the orientation fixed as above .",
    "then , @xmath33 is a skew - symmetric operator vanishing on @xmath30^{\\perp}$ ] , and we put @xmath34 .    with a second derivation @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting the orthogonal projection on the 2-subspace @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "thus : @xmath37    we let @xmath38 denote the position of the end - point for the critical configuration under investigation . with the parametrization and notation just described , and",
    "the abbreviation @xmath39 , the _ end - point function _ is :    @xmath40    this gives :    @xmath41    @xmath42    considering that @xmath43 , the resulting entries for the hessian matrix are :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    for @xmath48 .",
    "we retain the result of this computation as :    [ hessian - matrix ] with adequate parametrization , the symmetric @xmath49 hesssian matrix for the squared end - point distance function @xmath9 at a critical configuration @xmath23 , with end - point at @xmath50 , has entries :    @xmath51    and , after the change of basis @xmath52 , corresponds with the quadratic form given by :    @xmath53    for a non - zero critical value , the coefficients @xmath54 are obtained geometrically from the intersections of the line through the origin and the end - point @xmath55 with the hinges , since these intersections are precisely the points @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath9 takes the value zero , the hessian at a critical point in @xmath57 is equivalent to the gram matrix @xmath58 of the normals , which is semi - positive definite and has , in the generic case , rank @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the null - space corresponds to the tangent space of @xmath16 at the critical point under consideration .",
    "this is the bott non - degeneracy property required along the critical manifold @xmath16 .",
    "an upper - bound for the number of isolated critical points can be obtained from the following _ complexification _ :",
    "@xmath7 is complexified to @xmath59 by considering each circle @xmath60 as the real locus of the corresponding complex conic :    @xmath61    @xmath62    with some choice of a reference simplex in each hinge @xmath63 , say @xmath64 , the condition that the ` head - to - tail ' line meets this hinge becomes    @xmath65=0\\ ] ]    this defines in @xmath66 a hypersurface of multi - degree @xmath67 , with positions @xmath2 up to the @xmath21 coordinate .",
    "the intersection of these @xmath8 hypersurfaces yields , in the complex count , the number :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 stands for the class of a point in the @xmath21 factor @xmath70 , and @xmath71 denote eulerian numbers .",
    "thus , we have :    the number of isolated critical points for @xmath72 is bounded by    @xmath73      the determination of critical configurations and their indices can be used in the following setting : we _ assume _ a generic body - and - hinge chain , @xmath74 _ and zero to be a value of @xmath9_. this ensures the smoothness of the @xmath75-dimensional fiber @xmath57 over zero , and , for small enough @xmath76 , a diffeomorphism @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 stands for the 3-dimensional ball of radius @xmath79 . the @xmath80-dimensional fiber @xmath81 is thereby identified with @xmath82 .",
    "we ll use the notation @xmath7 for the n - dimensional torus representing the configuration space of our chain with @xmath1 panels and @xmath8 hinges . for small and nearby values",
    "@xmath83 we put :    @xmath84\\ ] ]    assuming all non - zero critical values of @xmath9 greater than @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the two open sets cover the torus @xmath86 , and we have _ homotopy equivalences _ :    @xmath87    the corresponding meyer - vietoris exact sequence gives :    @xmath88    and in particular , we have the relation of euler - characteristics :    @xmath89    by morse theory @xcite , the last euler - characteristic can be expressed in terms of critical points as follows : put @xmath90 for the number of critical points of index @xmath17 ; then :    @xmath91    * note : *  the common convention would be to use @xmath92 as the morse function .",
    "since we go with @xmath9 , the signs are as above .",
    "we obtained :    suppose @xmath93 and let the origin be a regular value of the end - point map for an otherwise generic chain .",
    "then , the @xmath75-dimensional manifold @xmath16 parametrizing all configurations with the origin coinciding with the end - point has the euler number :    @xmath94    where @xmath90 is the number of critical points of index @xmath17 for @xmath9 on @xmath95 .",
    "the restriction to panel - and - hinge chains brings new structural aspects .",
    "we note first the presence of natural transformations of the configurations space @xmath7 :    * transformations : *   given any configuration , one may consider the hyperplane through one marked point and some hinge , and reflect the part of the chain from point to hinge in this hyperplane .",
    "the resulting transformation is obviously its own inverse i.e. an _",
    "involution_. note that we may always reposition the structure with its first panel in its fixed location .",
    "since the composition of reflecting in the first and then last panel gives a global rotation of the chain , these two operations represent the same transformation of @xmath86 and this gives @xmath96 involutions on the configuration space , all transforming the fibers of @xmath9 to themselves .",
    "two such involutions commute when they implicate the same marked point or the respective portions of the chain do not overlap .",
    "we have seen that , in case @xmath9 reaches 0 , @xmath97 is part of the critical locus , but all critical points for non - zero critical values are isolated in the generic case .",
    "the following definition refers to these isolated critical configurations corresponding to non - zero critical values of @xmath9 :    the @xmath98 flattened configurations when all panels lie in the same hyperplane ( i.e. the codimension one subspace of the first panel , which is identified here with @xmath99 in @xmath0 ) will be called _ flat critical configurations ( points ) _ , while critical configurations which do not have all panels in the same hyperplane will be called _ non - flat critical configurations ( points)_.    it will be observed that , in a non - flat critical configuration , a new panel normal direction requires two consecutive hinges to meet the line from the origin to the end - point in the same point and we ll call such a point a _ fold point _ ( on the `` head - to - tail '' line ) .",
    "fold points will be considered as labelled by the corresponding pair of consecutive hinges and ordered via this labelling .    *",
    "note : *  flat critical configurations are fixed points of all involutions described above and the group they generate , while non - flat critical configurations have an orbit of cardinality @xmath100 under this group , where @xmath101 is the number of fold points on the `` head - to - tail '' line . assuming a generic case ,",
    "@xmath102 will give the number of distinct hyperplanes determined by origin and hinges .",
    "we settle first the case of all flat critical configurations .",
    "then all normal directions are the same and ( regardless of the choice @xmath103 ) proposition [ hessian - matrix ] gives the signature as that of the ( quadratic form with ) matrix :    @xmath104    the signature of the above matrix is determined by the signs of :    @xmath105    _ proof : _   the symmetric matrix @xmath106 is the expression of the quadratic form @xmath107 in the standard basis @xmath108",
    ". if we do the ( unimodular ) change of basis :    @xmath109    we obtain a diagonal matrix with the indicated entries .    as mentioned in proposition 2 ,",
    "if we mark the end - point by @xmath55 , and the intersections of the  head - to - tail `` line with the @xmath110 hinge is @xmath111 , then @xmath112 . for a generic chain in a flattened position ,",
    "hinges will intersect the ' ' head - to - tail \" line in different points , and we ll have a non - degenerate hessian . since by definition ,",
    "the index of a symmetric matrix is the number of negative eigen - values , we have :    [ flat - index ] the index of a flat critical configuration with hinges meeting the line from the origin to the end - point x at @xmath113 , is the number of negative values in the list :    @xmath114    [ flat - maximum ] a flat critical configuration is a local maximum if and only if the hinges meet the oriented segment @xmath115 in points @xmath113 , lined - up in their natural order , that is :    @xmath116    for a convenient geometric formulation of the existence of a local minimum in a flat configuration we conceive of the  head - to - tail \" line as completed to a projective line , and the complement of the affine segment @xmath117 $ ] gives then the open arc from @xmath118 to @xmath55 passing through the  point at infinity \" .",
    "[ flat - minimum ] a flat critical configuration is a local minimum if and only if the hinges meet the oriented arc from 0 to @xmath55 passing through the point at infinity in their natural order .",
    "this means one the following :    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    * remark : *  in fact , the projective formulation allows some relaxation in the genericity assumptions and one of the hinges may be parallel to the  head - to - tail \" line in that flat configuration .      in this section",
    "we refine our description of extremal configurations of panel - and - hinge chains in @xmath0 with two marked points .",
    "we ll elaborate on our corollaries [ flat - maximum ] and [ flat - minimum ] and address possible maxima and minima at non - flat critical configurations .",
    "one should remain aware of the involutions described in subsection 1.3 . recall that a fold point on the  head - to - tail \" line is common to two consecutive hinges , say @xmath122 . when speaking of the ordering of intersections of hinges with the  head - to - tail \" line , either ordering may be envisaged for the two hinges , but we intend the ordering requested in the statement .",
    "the function @xmath9 is the squared distance from  head \" to  tail \" .",
    "[ maxima ] a local maximal configuration for @xmath9 is characterized by the fact that all hinges intersect the oriented segment @xmath115 in the natural order . moreover ,",
    "a local maximum is in fact the global maximum and is unique modulo the natural transformations generated by the involutions described above .",
    "thus there are @xmath123 maximal configurations equivalent under natural transformations , where @xmath124 is the number of fold points for any and all of them .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "let us call _ flat subsystem _ in a non - flat critical configuration the panel - and - hinge structure obtained by retaining the consecutive axes which lie in the same hyperplane through the  head - to - tail \" line i.e. the hinges corresponding to a specific normal direction @xmath19 ( up to the first occurrence of a fold point , or between a fold point and the next , or up from the last fold point ) .",
    "the  head \" and  tail \" are inherited from the full configuration .",
    "then the expression ( [ hessian - bis ] ) we obtained for the hessian shows that a local maximum requires all flat subsystems to be flat local maxima .",
    "thus , by corollary [ flat - maximum ] , all hinges intersect the oriented segment @xmath115 in the natural sequential order .    as a consequence , we may trace a  red line \" on consecutive panels by following the segment @xmath117 $ ] in our local maximum configuration .",
    "thus , any other configuration will display the  red line \" as a polygonal arc from  head \" to  tail \" proving that our local maximum is the global maximum .",
    "it also follows that any other local maximum must have exactly the same pattern of planar subsystems and therefore be obtained from our maximal configuration by some composition of involutions .",
    "[ minima ] a local minimal configuration for a non - zero value of @xmath9 is characterized by the fact that all hinges intersect the oriented projective arc from 0 to @xmath55 passing through the point at infinity ( i.e. the complement of @xmath117 $ ] ) in the natural order . moreover ,",
    "if such a local minimum exists , it is in fact the global minimum and 0 is not a possible value for @xmath9 . when 0 is not a possible value for @xmath9 , all minima are achieved at @xmath125 minimal configurations equivalent under natural transformations , where @xmath126 is the number of fold points for any and all of them .    _",
    "proof : _  simple adaptation of the  red line \" argument presented above .",
    "the criteria obtained above for extremal configurations of marked panel - and - hinge chains in @xmath0 offer obvious suggestions for the more general _ body - and - hinge case_.    it is an immediate observation that a marked body - and - hinge chain for which the segment from the origin to the end - point intersects all hinges in their natural order is in a global maximum configuration , since for any other configuration , the previous segment ( drawn as a  red segment \" ) becomes a polygonal arc longer than the new segment from the origin to the end - point .",
    "what is less immediate is that any body - and - hinge chain actually reaches its global maximum in such a configuration .",
    "this will be proven by relating the global maximum to a global minimum .",
    "[ max - min ] let a body - and - hinge chain be presented in a fixed configuration , with the origin as the marked point of the first panel , @xmath127 the end - point ( on the last body ) and hinges given by codimension two affine subspaces @xmath128 .",
    "consider variable points on each hinge @xmath129 and the length of the polygonal arc going from the origin to the end - point through the points @xmath130 in their natural order :    @xmath131    the global maximum distance between the marked points of the given body - and - hinge chain equals the global minimum of the function @xmath132 .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "note that @xmath132 is continuous and a global minimum always exists .",
    "the proof will follow from the simple case of a single hinge ( n=1 ) . in this case , @xmath133 must be the unique point of @xmath134 which allows a rotation of the segment from @xmath133 to @xmath127 around @xmath134 to become a continuation of the segment from the origin to @xmath133 . repeating this observation with respect to @xmath135 and the hinge @xmath15",
    ", shows that the chain can be reconfigured so that the polygonal arc realizing the global minimum becomes a straight segment from the origin to the end - point intersecting all hinges in their natural order .",
    "that is the global maximum .",
    "we have proven at the same time our :    * global maximum theorem : *  _ a body - and - hinge chain is in a global maximum configuration if and only if the segment from the origin to the end - point intersects all hinges in their natural order . for a generic body - and - hinge chain ,",
    "this global maximum is unique .",
    "_    * remarks : *  ( i )  in general , a body - and - hinge chain may well have local maxima which are not global maxima . by ( [ hessian - bis ] ) , the segment from the origin to the end - point must intersect all hinges .",
    "( ii )  @xmath132 is continuous , but not differentiable when @xmath136 for some @xmath17 .",
    "examples show that global minima for body - and - hinge chains do not have to respect the pattern observed for panel - and - hinge chains .",
    "we may consider , for instance , just two hinges ( say in @xmath137 ) and take the second body ( containing these hinges ) as reference .",
    "then the marked points trace circles , each around a hinge .",
    "examples of global minima with the hinges intersecting in the order @xmath138 the projective arc from origin to the endpoint passing thorough infinity , can be easily produced .",
    "what still holds true , by ( [ hessian - bis ] ) , for any local minimum is the fact that all hinges intersect the projective arc from the origin to the end - point , passing through the point at infinity .",
    "a few ` variations ' of these techniques should be mentioned before concluding .",
    "again , the issues are important in robotics and the necessary conditions have been detected in the literature @xcite .",
    "if we abandon the first marked point , we ll rather be concerned with the squared distance from the end - point to the first hinge .",
    "the resulting critical configurations for non - zero values will require the _ perpendicular _ from the end - point to the first hinge to meet ( projectively ) all hinges . the global maximum will require the natural ordering of these intersections on the segment from the foot of the perpendicular to the end - point .",
    "in dimension three , a similar scenario holds if we abandon both marked points and only inquire about the squared distance between the first hinge and the last hinge .",
    "critical configurations for non - zero values will have the common perpendicular of these two hinges intersect ( projectively ) all the intermediate hinges .",
    "the global maximum will require the natural ordering ."
