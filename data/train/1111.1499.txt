    "self - assembled qds have been one of the archetypal systems . within the full gamut of possible combinations of self - organized materials,@xcite the inas on gaas system stands out due to extensive research efforts devoted over more than a decade to their growth and optoelectronic characterizations.@xcite for the purposes of controlling the spin dynamics in inas qds ,",
    "several groups@xcite have studied various aspects of the optical orientation@xcite of an electron spin and its transfer to the nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction leading to the dynamic nuclear spin polarization.@xcite    one of the remarkable achievements that paved the way to the coherent manipulation of nuclear spin dynamics has been the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) of a _ single _",
    "qd.@xcite with further improved precision , position selective control of small groups of nuclear spins inside a dot is being pursued.@xcite this so - called optically detected nmr is initiated by the circularly polarized excitation of a spin - polarized electron spin inside a qd that polarizes the nuclear spins through the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the overhauser field established by the polarized nuclei acts back on the electronic system , which can be externally measured over an excitonic zeeman splitting . additionally if an rf magnetic field resonant with nuclear spin transitions is incident , it depolarizes some of the nuclear spins reducing the overhauser field , which can in turn be detected from a shift in the optical emission spectra . along this line ,",
    "a recent demonstration utilized a sequence of two phase - locked rf pulses to induce coherent rotations of a targeted group of nuclear spins optically pumped to a high polarization degree.@xcite the advantage of this technique is that it enables full coherent control over the bloch sphere and yet on the order of microsecond time scales .",
    "these nmr experiments were performed on gaas interface - fluctuation qds with the deliberate aim of avoiding any strain to keep the resonances narrow.@xcite on the other hand strain is an integral part of self - assembled inas qds.@xcite the existing negative sentiments for the strain in the context of electron and nuclear spin dynamics have been dramatically reversed by the work of dzhioev and korenev.@xcite actually , several decades ago it was experimentally shown that anisotropic strain in a iii - v crystal lattice causes local electric field gradients ( efg ) with which a spin-@xmath0 nucleus with @xmath1 interacts because of its quadrupolar moment.@xcite this quadrupolar interaction ( qi ) splits the nuclear spin degeneracy even in the absence of an external magnetic field,@xcite hence it energetically suppresses the nuclear spin flip events , stabilizing the electron spin orientation confined in the qd.@xcite with this paradigm shift , strain is no longer just a nuisance but something to be exploited as a new degree of freedom to tailor the magnetic environment of inas qds .    the aim of this work is to offer an atomistic understanding of the interesting physics arising from the coexistence of qi together with the dc and rf magnetic fields .",
    "this is in accord with the current progress of the experimental techniques having the goal to address and control relatively few number of nuclei within a qd.@xcite starting from the behavior of the spatial variation of the strain tensor , we trace the factors that affect qi , and identify primarily the high aspect ratio of the qd as a factor for enhancing it . considering different magnetic field orientations and the effect of random alloy mixing i.e. , in@xmath2ga@xmath3as qds , critical insight is gained on the vulnerability of each nuclear spin transition in the nmr spectrum under inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "an important complication is that the mole fraction of the constituents can vary appreciably from dot to dot within the same sample,@xcite rendering the in situ compositional identification of a targeted qd so far not practical .",
    "we demonstrate that this can be readily extracted from the main span of the nmr spectra",
    ". moreover , our element - resolved spectra present crucial information for the labeling of the features in the rather complicated overall spectra . for the typical qd parameters reported in relevant experiments",
    ", we extract an effective quadrupolar field , @xmath4 of 1.5  t ( 1.1  t ) for the in ( as ) nuclei , as a borderline below which qi dominates .",
    "the atomistic picture that we acquire also provides us the distribution of the quadrupolar principal axes within the qd . we make use of this information in working out the nuclear spin depolarization due to noncollinear secular hyperfine interaction arising from the tilting of the major quadrupolar axis from the optical axis .",
    "the depolarization time drops to a minimum on the order of an hour at the magnetic field coinciding with @xmath4 , as a manifestation of the strong competition between the qi and the zeeman field at this value .",

    "iv we summarize our conclusions , and append a section on the matrix elements for obtaining the energy spectra and the rf - initiated nuclear spin transitions under an arbitrary efg .",
    "although the theoretical ingredients employed in this work are not new , an account of the procedures and the mathematical models will be helpful for clarifying how the results are obtained .      from a computational point of view , to identify the strain profile , the ionic relaxation of the qd and the host matrix atoms is needed .",
    "the technique used for this purpose is molecular statics as implemented in the lammps code.@xcite here , the main input is the semi - classical force field that governs the atomic interactions .",
    "the preferred choice for group  iv and iii - v semiconductors are the abell - tersoff potentials.@xcite we make use of the recent parametrization by powell _",

    "the non - secular part of @xmath40 , which is responsible for the spin flip - flops as a direct process becomes energetically impossible due to the presence of the external magnetic field and the large energy mismatch between nuclear and electronic zeeman energies . on the other hand in the noncollinear case of major efg principal axis",

    ", we would like to focus on the evolution of the qz spectra from the quadrupolar- to the zeeman - dominated regime .",
    "one can easily realize the marked discrepancy between the faraday and voigt geometries : in the former , as the magnetic field is increased , the quadrupolar - split @xmath60 state moves down in energy through a number of band crossings followed by a final anticrossing .",

    "however , their intensity is about two orders of magnitude weaker , and for this reason will not be included here .",
    "we assume that initially all nuclear spin states are equally populated giving rise to _ full _ spectra , which can be justified based on the much smaller energy separations among qz states with respect to thermal energy at few kelvins , as well as due to the presence of dipole - dipole interactions among the nuclei.@xcite as a caveat , we would like to point out that some _ parts _ of the full spectra , to be discussed below , can become hindered depending on how the nuclear spin ensemble gets prepared under various experimental realizations .",

    "for this reason , in nuclei are dominant on the total spectra .",

    "the severity of the inhomogeneous broadening can be clearly observed from a comparison between the single nucleus and element - resolved spectra .",
    "as expected , the higher - order transitions , which are forbidden in the absence of qi are highly broadened because of the atomistic level strain variation over the qd to which they owe their existance .",
