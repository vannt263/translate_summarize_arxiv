    "<S> an accurate treatment of coulomb breakup reactions is presented by using both the gaussian expansion method and the method of continuum discretized coupled channels . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0-type basis functions for describing bound- and continuum - states of a projectile , we take complex - range gaussian functions , which form in good approximation a complete set in a large configuration space being important for coulomb - breakup processes . </S>",
    "<S> accuracy of the method is tested quantitatively for @xmath1ni scattering at 25.8 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters is one of the central issues in the neutrino physics . </S>",
    "<S> the astrophysical factor @xmath2 , which is essentially equal to the cross section of the @xmath3-capture reaction @xmath4be(@xmath5)@xmath6b , plays an important role in the parameter - search procedure , since the prediction value for the flux of @xmath6b solar neutrino is proportional to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the required accuracy from astrophysics is about 5% in errors  @xcite . due to difficulties of direct measurements of @xmath4be(@xmath5)@xmath6b at very low energies , alternative indirect measurements were proposed ; @xmath6b coulomb breakup  @xcite is a typical example of them .    </S>",
    "<S> the method of continuum discretized coupled channels  @xcite ( cdcc ) , which was shown to describe various projectile - breakup processes  , has also been applied to @xmath6b coulomb breakup with high degrees of success  @xcite . in the all analyses above , cdcc describes the reaction system with a three - body model , i.e. , @xmath3+@xmath4be+a as shown in fig .  1 .        from @xmath6b coulomb breakup measured at intermediate energies , @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> was determined using the first - order perturbation theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that @xmath2 can alternatively be determined by cdcc analysis , combined with the asymptotic normalization coefficient method  @xcite , of @xmath6b breakup even at low energies , such as the notre dame ( nd ) experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found , however , that the nd data contain an irrelevant component to @xmath2 , corresponding to the @xmath7 @xmath4be excited state in the final channel , which of order 10% presents in the @xmath6b ground state  @xcite ; effects of this component on @xmath2 can be expected around 10% . therefore , the evaluated value of @xmath2 in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite should be assumed as the upper limit of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> even though the irrelevant component can be experimentally removed by detecting the emitted @xmath4be in the ground state , the @xmath7 @xmath4be excited state may play a dynamical role during the breakup process of @xmath6b . </S>",
    "<S> thus , description of @xmath6b breakup beyond the three - body model , i.e. , @xmath3+@xmath8he+@xmath9he+a four - body model , is highly expected in order to determine @xmath2 with very high accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a new treatment of breakup continuum in cdcc was proposed  @xcite , which uses pseudo - state ( ps ) wave functions  @xcite obtained by diagonalizing internal hamiltonian of the projectile with gaussian basis functions  @xcite . for nuclear breakup processes , </S>",
    "<S> cdcc with the ps method ( ps - cdcc ) was found to perfectly reproduce the exact  </S>",
    "<S> breakup @xmath10-matrix elements @xmath11 calculated by the standard cdcc , i.e. , with the average ( av ) method  @xcite for discretization of breakup continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the most important feature of ps - cdcc is that it generates @xmath11 as a smooth function of @xmath12 in its entire range , without assuming any form _ a priori _ for @xmath12-distributions , in contrast to cdcc with the av method ( av - cdcc ) .    additionally , as discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , ps - cdcc with gaussian basis functions makes it possible the four - body cdcc analysis of projectile breakup , a preliminary result of which for @xmath13he elastic scattering , including effects of breakup channels of @xmath13he , has already been obtained  @xcite . before making four - body ps - cdcc analysis of @xmath6b coulomb breakup , however , one must see the applicability of ps - cdcc to breakup processes due to long - ranged coulomb coupling potentials . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite nontrivial because the @xmath14-space of the projectile needed to describe coulomb breakup is much larger than that in the case of nuclear breakup ; for example , the effective space is @xmath15 fm for nuclear breakup of @xmath16 or @xmath17li  @xcite , but @xmath18 fm for coulomb breakup of @xmath19b  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this brief report is , as the first step towards the four - body cdcc analysis of @xmath6b coulomb breakup , to show that three - body ps - cdcc based on the gaussian basis functions can well describe the corresponding result of three - body av - cdcc for @xmath6b breakup . </S>",
    "<S> as for the test case we take @xmath6b breakup from @xmath20ni at 25.8 mev .    below </S>",
    "<S> we briefly recapitulate the formulation of three - body cdcc . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the three - body system of fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> . the model hamiltonian of the system is @xmath21 coordinates are defined in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> . operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are kinetic energies associated with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and @xmath26 is the interaction between b and c. the interaction @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) between b ( c ) and a is taken to be the optical potential for b+a ( c+a ) scattering ; coulomb breakup is induced by the coulomb components of the potentials . for simplicity , in this study we neglect the intrinsic spins of individual constituents of the system .    in cdcc </S>",
    "<S> , the states of the projectile are classified by the linear and the angular momenta , @xmath12 and @xmath29 , of relative motion between b and c , which are truncated by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the truncation is the most basic assumption in cdcc , and it is confirmed that calculated @xmath10-matrix elements converge for sufficiently large @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the converged cdcc solution is the unperturbed solution of the distorted faddeev equations , and corrections to the solution are negligible within the region of space in which the reaction takes place  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12-continuum of the b+c system are then discretized into a finite number of states , each of which corresponds to a discretized - continuum state  with a certain positive eigenenergy labeled by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting orthonormalized wave functions , @xmath35 , are assumed to form an approximate complete set in the @xmath14- and @xmath12-space being important for the breakup reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the three - body wave function @xmath36 of the system is expanded by @xmath37 and then inserted into the approximate three - body schrdinger equation @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> one can then obtain a set of coupled differential equations , called cdcc equations , that provide the discrete @xmath10-matrix element , @xmath39 , for the transition from the initial channel to a discretized - continuum one @xmath40 . in order to calculate a breakup cross section of the projectile with a certain range of breakup energies , or a coincidence - cross - section , </S>",
    "<S> a smoothing procedure , which constructs continuous @xmath41 from the discrete @xmath39 , is necessary . actually , this is the case in the analysis of @xmath6b coulomb - breakup experiments  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> discretization of the breakup continuum in the ps method is done by diagonalizing the internal hamiltonian @xmath42 in a space spanned by a finite number of @xmath0-type basis - functions , for which we here take the following pairs of functions  @xcite , @xmath43 \\cos\\left[\\,b\\,(r / a_{j})^2\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\phi^{\\rm s}_{j\\ell}(r ) & = & r^{\\ell}\\exp\\left[-(r / a_{j})^2\\right ] \\sin\\left[\\,b\\,(r / a_{j})^2\\right ] , \\quad ( j = 1 \\mbox{-- } n ) , \\nonumber \\label{eq : comp - g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 are assumed to increase in a geometric progression and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the basis as the complex - range gaussian basis , since the basis functions can be expressed by gaussian functions with a complex - range parameter , @xmath46 $ ] , and its complex conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> the complex - range gaussian basis functions are oscillating with @xmath14 , so they can simulate the oscillating pattern of the continuous breakup - state wave - functions as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is very important for the description of coulomb breakup by ps - cdcc . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate transformation from @xmath39 to @xmath41 : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , is possible when the basis functions form an approximate complete set in the finite configuration space being important for the breakup process  @xcite .    in the av method , on the other hand , the @xmath12-continuum [ 0 , @xmath32 ] , for each @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> , is divided into a finite number of bins , each with a width @xmath50 , and the continuum breakup - states in the @xmath34 th bin are averaged with a weight function @xmath51  @xcite ; we in this study take @xmath52 for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting orthonormal state is then described as @xmath53 inserting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ state - av ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s - matrix - appro ] ) leads to @xmath54 for @xmath55 , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that @xmath56 is smooth only within each bin , while @xmath57 with the ps method , i.e. , @xmath58 , is a smooth function of @xmath12 in its entire range . </S>",
    "<S> details of the discretization and smoothing procedures both for the av and ps methods can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in order to see the applicability of ps - cdcc for coulomb breakup , we calculated the breakup cross section of @xmath6b+@xmath20ni scattering at 25.8 mev . in this process </S>",
    "<S> both nuclear and coulomb interactions , with interference , play important roles . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , first order perturbation theory can not reproduce the experimental data  @xcite at all , since higher - order processes can not be neglected at such a low incident energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is a good test for ps - cdcc to compare the results with those calculated by av - cdcc that reproduce the experimental data very well  @xcite .    for both the av and ps methods </S>",
    "<S> , we took the @xmath6b single - particle wave - function of esbensen and bertsch  @xcite and the same potential as for the ground state was used to generate wave functions in scattering states ; the depth of the potential is fitted to reproduce the separation energy of the proton , i.e. , 137 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we included only s- and p - states of @xmath6b for saving computation time . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that d- and f - states are necessary to reproduce the experimental data  @xcite . our aim in this brief report , however , is to see the convergence between two theoretical calculations . as for the distorting potential for @xmath3-@xmath20ni ( @xmath4be-@xmath20ni ) </S>",
    "<S> , we adopted the parameter set of yamashita  @xcite ( moroz _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum total - angular - momentum @xmath59 is 1000 and @xmath60 is taken to be 500 fm . </S>",
    "<S> cdcc equations were solved with the predictor - corrector numerov method with stabilization  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> b ; the left ( right ) side corresponds to the s - state ( p - state ) . </S>",

    "<S> the maximum internal coordinate @xmath65 was taken to be 100 fm . in order to obtain the correct asymptotic form of the coulomb coupling potentials </S>",
    "<S> , we made the following approximation for the monopole components : @xmath66 where @xmath67 or @xmath4be . in the practical calculation we took account for coulomb radii for @xmath3-@xmath20ni and @xmath4be-@xmath20ni and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ screen ] ) has a slightly complicated form  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ screen ] ) is exact when @xmath68 ; the numerical results shown below were found to converge at @xmath69 fm . </S>",
    "<S> the result thus obtained , i.e. , with av - cdcc , is assumed to be the exact  solution .    </S>",

    "<S> the number of channels included in the cdcc calculation , i.e. , @xmath75 @xmath61 , was 18 for both the s- and p - states . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting wave functions with positive eigenenergies turned out to oscillate up to about 100 fm . in order to obtain orthonormality of the @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> , we put @xmath77 fm in the calculation of coupling potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we show the level sequences of the resulting discrete eigenstates in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> one sees each interval of the levels is almost even , which is just the same as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 the calculated angular distribution of @xmath6b total breakup cross section for @xmath20ni(@xmath6b,@xmath6b@xmath70 ) at 25.8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the solid and dashed lines correspond to the av and ps methods , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one sees both results coincide with very high accuracy , which implies that a forthcoming four - body ps - cdcc analysis of @xmath6b coulomb breakup has enough accuracy to determine a reliable value of @xmath2 , i.e. , within 5% of errors .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath10-matrix elements.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in order to see the validity of ps - cdcc for the @xmath6b coulomb breakup more strictly , below we compare @xmath80 with @xmath81 . in the calculation of the latter , i.e. , the exact  @xmath41 , we put @xmath82 for the p - state to be 0.66/32 @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath81 clearer , since @xmath81 is constant in @xmath12-region corresponding to each bin with the width of @xmath82 , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this refinement of the modelspace for the av method makes no changes in the physical quantities such as the elastic and total breakup cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the result of the comparison of @xmath83 at @xmath78 , which corresponds to the scattering angle of 10@xmath84 assuming the classical path . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that cdcc calculation with only coulomb coupling potentials gives a peak at 10@xmath84 in the total breakup cross section . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it can be assumed that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 corresponds to the most - coulomb - like breakup process ; in any case , features of the result were found to be almost independent of @xmath85 . in each panel of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> one sees that the result of ps - cdcc ( solid line ) very well reproduces the exact  solution ( step line ) for all @xmath12 being significant for the @xmath6b coulomb  breakup .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> ps - cdcc proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is shown to describe coulomb breakup processes very well . due to the long - ranged coulomb coupling - potentials , </S>",
    "<S> the modelspace required for cdcc is very large . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , one must prepare the internal wave functions of the projectile , both in bound and continuum states , for a wide range of the internal coordinate , say , 0100 fm , which is in general difficult for ps methods . </S>",
    "<S> we found that this can easily be achieved by using the complex - range gaussian basis , in the case of two - body projectile . according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the basis is also applicable to the reaction processes with three- and four - body projectiles , since energies and wave functions of the pseudo - states of the projectiles are given easily . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all coupled - channel potentials in four- and five - body ps - cdcc can analytically be given by expanding each nuclear - optical - potential concerned in terms of gaussian functions . </S>",
    "<S> then , ps - cdcc based on the complex - range gaussian basis functions is expected to become an effective method of practical use even for four - body coulomb breakup of @xmath19b , in which @xmath19b is assumed to be a bound state of the @xmath3+@xmath8he+@xmath9he system . </S>",
    "<S> such a four - body analysis of @xmath19b dissociation is desirable in order to determine @xmath2 with high accuracy and then approach to the solar neutrino problem from the nuclear physics side . </S>"
