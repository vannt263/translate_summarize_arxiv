    "the two point angular correlation function has been extensively used to study the clustering properties of galaxies . at large angular separations , @xmath17 , it is well established that faint galaxies are less clustered compared to galaxies observed locally .",

    "the results range from a strong excess to a deficiency of pairs with respect to an inward extrapolation of @xmath29 at larger separations .",
    "this excess in may be due to a population of `` companions '' not present at the current epoch , or luminosity enhancement of intrinsically faint galaxies in pairs .    in this letter we present the first clear detection of a break from a power law observed at larger separations in the angular two point correlation function , @xmath30 , at @xmath31 .",

    "five minute exposures through a redshifted b filter which is almost equivalent to a regular kron - cousin r filter ( b/(z=0.4 ) , hereafter @xmath41 ) were sufficient to provide good quality images .",

    "tab : excess ] the contribution of groups with more than 5 members is 52 pairs corresponding to a negligible @xmath73 .",
    "next , we consider multiple detections of several faint spurious sources for each physically distinct galaxy by our finding algorithm . for this purpose , all images were inspected by eye , eliminating all possible sources of contamination , namely , bright galaxies , scratches , bad pixels and cosmetic defects on the chip .",
    "there is also the possibility of contaminating light .",

    "the principal result from these surveys is that follows a power law , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the standard value ) , and a is the amplitude scaling with magnitude . in this work we have taken ip95 as the canonical in the red and the solid line in fig .",

    "however , at small angular scales ( @xmath31 ) , except for the work by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , no previous work shows a significant excess in by more than one @xmath80 .",
    "the quality and amount of data that we have used in this work are sufficient to make us believe that the excess at small scales is a real effect .",
    "how can a high clustering amplitude at small separations be understood ?",
    "one of the possibilities is to assume that mergers were more frequent at @xmath81 and the excess of pairs that we are seeing at that epoch is in fact mergers in progress .",
    "they represent a true density excess .",
    "another scenario that we can not rule out is the possibility of an excess of strongly clustered dwarf galaxies .",
    "two alternatives are possible in this hypothesis : a new class of dwarf population proposed by babul & rees ( 1992 ) which would be recently ` active ' , but subsequently fading out of view ; or the ` sub - units ' proposed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which would slowly merge to form more massive galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that this excess in is due to brightening of low luminosity companions ( carlberg , 1992 ) .",
    "a fourth possibility is that although there is clustering evolution at scales larger than 6@xmath28 there is no clustering evolution at scales @xmath82 . in this case , is well fitted by a model with @xmath83 at @xmath64 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "thus , there is a scale @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , @xmath81 ) at which the clustering evolution slows down .    in order to show this latter point",
    "we have computed _ standard models _ for .",
    "if we assume a power law spatial correlation function ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the proper distance , @xmath90 is the proper correlation length and @xmath91 is the clustering evolution index ; @xmath92 means clustering fixed in comoving coordinates and @xmath83 represents stable clustering in physical coordinates .",
    "the angular correlation function is obtained through limber s equation ( peebles 1980 eqs [ 56.7 ] and [ 56.13 ] and ip95 ) . the no  evolution redshift distribution , @xmath93 , is taken from metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ( see ip95 for discussion and justification of our choice ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : w21.5 ] three models are shown : the _ standard model _",
    "( @xmath94 , @xmath83 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , solid line ) , a model with clustering evolution , ( @xmath94 , @xmath84 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , dashed line ) , and a model with either clustering evolution , ( @xmath94 , @xmath97 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , dashed dotted line ) or a model with a strong local correlation length ( @xmath94 , @xmath83 , @xmath95 and @xmath98 , dash  dotted line ) .",
    "the _ standard model _ with clustering evolution ( @xmath84 ) fits very well the observations in the range @xmath99 .",
    "the value of @xmath91 agrees with the results obtained by shepherd et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where the low amplitude of the correlation function might be due to strong clustering evolution since @xmath81 .    the small scale data ( @xmath31 )",
    "is better fitted by a model with either a high local clustering length ( @xmath98 ) or @xmath97 .",
    "if we assume a correlation length as observed for present day @xmath100 galaxies ( @xmath96 ) , no clustering evolution ( @xmath83 ) , and no luminosity evolution , the clustering properties of galaxies at @xmath101 and spatial separations @xmath87 ( for @xmath81 ) , in the @xmath102 passband are similar to present day @xmath100 galaxies .",
    "the excess in with respect to this model might correspond to the galaxy merger rate discussed in the next section .",
    "if the mean redshift of our sample is 0.35 then our data show a clear detection of the scale , @xmath12 , at which the clustering evolution approaches a highly non linear regime , where @xmath103 is expected .",
    "the merger rate is expected to have a strong redshift dependence varying as roughly as @xmath14 , where @xmath104 .",
    "however , the difficulty of identifying objects even at moderate redshift is a limiting factor in studies of faint galaxy pairs .",
    "another factor is imposed by the significant amount of large telescope time required in order to obtain redshifts and good quality images for a statistically significant sample of faint galaxies .",
    "so far , only a few previous works have redshift information for faint galaxies in pairs ( see koo & kron 1992 and ellis 1995 for reviews on redshift surveys and imaging of the faint galaxy population ) .",
    "there are two ways ( not independent , though ) to calculate the galaxy merger rate from our data .",
    "first , we count the number of isolated pairs of galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath2 , at scales @xmath105 ( @xmath106  @xmath107 , for @xmath81 and @xmath108 ) , and compare it with numbers of pairs from local galaxy surveys selected in the same way .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in pairs in our catalog is @xmath109 ( @xmath110 uncertainty ) .",
    "the expected fraction of physical pairs is @xmath111 , if @xmath112 .",
    "following carlberg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the fraction of galaxies that will merge is 0.7 .",
    "thus , the percentage of galaxies in physical pairs that will eventually merge is @xmath113 . at low redshifts",
    "this value is @xmath114 ( carlberg et al .",
    "if the rate at which galaxies merge is proportional to @xmath14 , then @xmath115 . ( the uncertainty in the merger rate is dominated by the uncertainty in the fraction of galaxies that will merge .",
    "we assume 0.1 . )",
    "second , the galaxy merger rate can be calculated using the excess correlation of our faint galaxies over what would be expected from the _ standard model_. the fractional excess @xmath67 over what would be expected from the _ standard model _ is @xmath116 ( @xmath117 corresponding to @xmath118 at @xmath119 ) .",
    "given that @xmath120 , then @xmath121 .",
    "it is to be noticed that no corrections for the fraction of physical pairs that will merge has been made in this case .",
    "we have estimated from a well defined sample of galaxies at @xmath122 and at small angular separation , @xmath8 .",
    "we have performed simulations in order to test detection efficiency of galaxy pairs and the limiting magnitude in our galaxy sample .",
    "we find that our algorithms can detect , at a 99% confidence level , the two components of a pair separated by @xmath123 and with @xmath124 in our ctio 4 m prime focus ccd images .",
    "our analysis indicates that there is an excess of power in at @xmath126 over what would be expected from an extrapolation of the canonical power law at larger @xmath4 .",
    "the significance of this excess is @xmath127 .",
    "these results place limits on the galaxy merger rate of ( 1+z)@xmath128 .    at large angular scales ( @xmath6 ) the data",
