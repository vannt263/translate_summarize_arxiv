    "the taurus - auriga - perseus region offers the opportunity to study the x - ray emission of young stars at several evolutionary stages .",
    "the youngest stars observed by _ rosat _ in this portion of the sky are the t tauri stars ( ttss ) of the taurus - auriga and perseus star forming regions , late - type pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars of @xmath5 with an estimated age of @xmath6 .",
    "two young star clusters , the pleiades and hyades , are also located in this region of the sky at age of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "they consist mostly of zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stars , except for some higher mass post - main sequence stars and brown dwarfs , which are not studied here .    from the early observations by the _ einstein _",
    "satellite it was concluded that the x - ray emission of young stars arises in an optically thin , hot plasma at temperatures above @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission region has been associated with the stellar corona where the x - rays are produced  more or less analogous to the solar x - ray emission  through a stellar @xmath10-@xmath11-dynamo .",
    "the dynamo is driven by the combination of rotation and convective motions .",
    "correlations between the x - ray emission of late - type stars and the stellar rotation support the notion that dynamo - generated magnetic fields are responsible for heating the coronae ( @xcite ) . but successful direct measurements of the magnetic fields of ttss have been performed only recently ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the heating mechanism are still not well understood .",
    "the correlation between stellar rotation and x - ray emission of late - type stars suggests that the rotational evolution of young stars determines the development of stellar activity .",
    "the rotational evolution of low - mass pms stars partly depends on the circumstellar environment . while classical ttss ( hereafter cttss )",
    "are surrounded by a circumstellar disk , inferred from ir dust emission ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) and more recently from direct imaging ( e.g. @xcite ) , weak - line ttss ( wttss ) lack such a disk , or at least the disk is not optically thick .",
    "owing to contraction wttss spin up as they approach the main sequence . for cttss ,",
    "on the other hand , coupling between the disk and the star may prevent spin - up ( @xcite ) .",
    "the period observed on the zams depends on the time the star has spent in the ctts phase . after the main - sequence is reached , the rotation rate decreases again ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as a consequence of their slower rotation , stars on the zams and main sequence ( ms ) should on average show less x - ray activity than pms stars .",
    "earlier investigations of x - ray observations of young late - type stars were mostly concerned with the quiescent emission ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , 1999 , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to these studies we focus on the occurrence of x - ray flares . furthermore we discuss a larger sample than most of the previous studies by using _",
    "all _ currently available observations from the _ rosat _ public data archive that contain any tts , pleiad or hyad in the field of view .",
    "x - ray flares may be used as a diagnostics of stellar activity .",
    "they are thought to originate in magnetic loops .",
    "in contrast to findings from quasi - static loop modeling , the only direct determination of the size of a flaring region ( @xcite ) shows that the emitting region is very compact . in the loops which confine",
    "the coronal plasma magnetic reconnection suddenly frees large amounts of energy which is dissipated into heat and thus leads to a temporary enhancement of the x - ray emission .",
    "the decay of the lightcurve is accompanied by a corresponding ( exponential ) decay of the temperature and emission measure , which are obtained from one- or two - temperature spectral models for an optically thin , thermal plasma ( @xcite , @xcite , 1986 ) .",
    "the most powerful x - ray flares have been observed on the youngest objects , notably a flare on the infrared class i protostar ylw  15 in @xmath12 oph which has been presented by .",
    "x - ray flares on ttss observed so far ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) exceed the maximum emission observed from solar flares by a factor of @xmath13 and more .",
    "some extreme events have shown x - ray luminosities of @xmath14 . although some of the strongest x - ray flares ever observed were detected on ttss to date no systematic search for tts flares was undertaken .",
    "this paper is devoted to a study of the relation between x - ray flare activity and other stellar parameters , such as age , rotation rate , and multiplicity . for this purpose",
    "we perform a statistical investigation of _ rosat _ observations .",
    "we develop a method for the flare detection based on our conception of the typical shape of a flare lightcurve , where the term ` typical shape ' refers to the characteristics of the x - ray lightcurve described above , i.e. a significant rise and subsequent decay of the lightcurve to the previous emission level .",

    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the stellar sample and explain the analysis of the raw data .",
    "details about our membership lists for ttss , pleiads , and hyads are given below ( sect .",
    "[ subsect : member ] ) .",
    "we have retrieved all pointed _ rosat _ pspc observations from the archive that contain at least one of the stars from these lists in their field .",
    "the observations are listed in table  [ tab : pids ] . after performing source detection on all of these pointings ,",
    "we have cross correlated the membership lists with the detected x - ray sources and identified individual ttss , pleiads , and hyads in the x - ray image .",
    "the process of source detection and identification is described in sect .",
    "[ subsect : soudet ] .",
    "the analysis presented here is confined to the taurus - auriga - perseus region .",
    "this portion of the sky includes the taurus - auriga complex , the mbm12 cloud , and the perseus molecular clouds with the reflection nebula ngc1333 and the young cluster ic348 .",
    "two open clusters containing mostly zams stars are found nearby the above mentioned star forming regions , the pleiades and the hyades .",
    "the choice of this specific sky region thus enables us to compare the x - ray emission of young stars at different ages .    our sample of low - mass pms stars in and around taurus consists of all ttss which are either on or very close to the taurus star forming clouds or off the clouds at locations where they can still be linked with the taurus clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we restrict our taurus sample to objects between @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the ttss in taurus comprise those listed in the herbig - bell catalog ( @xcite ; hbc ) , in or in .",
    "in addition we include ttss newly identified either as counterparts to previously unidentified _ rosat _ sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or by other means ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "ttss in the molecular cloud mbm12 ( see @xcite ) are also in the examined sky region .",
    "in addition to ttss from tau - aur we include those from the perseus molecular cloud complex , mainly ic348 and ngc1333 , in our analysis .",
    "our list of ttss in ic348 comprises x - ray detections identified with h@xmath10 emission stars or with proper motion members ( tables  4  and  5 in @xcite ) , and emission line stars from , and . tts members of ngc1333 are listed in .",
    "all objects with low lithium strength are excluded , because it is dubious whether they are young .",
    "we accept only those objects as pms stars which show more lithium than pleiades stars of the same spectral type , i.e. we exclude all those with @xmath20(li ) lower than @xmath21  for f- and g - type stars and lower than @xmath22  for k - type stars .",
    "when applying this criterion , we always use the spectrum with the best resolution and best s / n , i.e. the high - resolution spectra from wichmann et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . if no high - resolution spectra are available , we use the medium - resolution spectra from , , or .",
    "members of the pleiades and hyades clusters are selected from the open cluster database compiled by c. prosser and collegues ( available at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/ @xmath23stauffer / opencl / index.html ) .",
    "the tables collected in prosser s database provide a summary of membership classification based on different methods , such as photometry , spectra , radial velocity and h@xmath10 emission .",
    "in addition a final membership determination is given which we use to define our membership lists .",

    "all detections with @xmath24 ( corresponding to @xmath25gaussian @xmath26 determined as best choice by @xcite ) are written to a source list , which is subsequently cross - correlated with the membership lists introduced above .",
    "the maximum distance @xmath27 between optical and x - ray position to be allowed in this identification process depends on the off - axis angle of the source because the positional accuracy of the pspc is worse at larger distances from the center due to broader point spread function ( psf ) . from distributions of the normalized cumulative number of identifications",
    "versus offset @xmath27 for different off - axis ranges we have determined the optimum cross - correlation radius for all detector positions ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed description of this process together with a table providing @xmath27 for different off - axis ranges will be given in stelzer et al .",

    "using binned data to detect flares introduces observational restrictions .",
    "the sensitivity for detection of small flares is lower and very short flares remain unobserved due to the time binning . apart from these limitations , our flare detection produces reliable results as verified by comparison to both an alternative approach using bayesian statistics and , where possible , previous detections of flares by visual inspection stated in the literature .    the importance of bayesian statistics to astronomical time series analysis has been described by and first applied to _ rosat _ observations of flare stars by .",
    "this approach , unlike the ` classical ' method used here , works on the raw , unbinned data and therefore has a time resolution which is only limited by the instrument clock .    we have performed a detailed comparison of the events recognized by the two methods . for the flare detection with the bayesian algorithm the prior odds ratio , @xmath29 , was set to 1 .",
    "this means that at the beginning one - rate and two - rate poisson processes are assumed to have the same probability for being the correct description of the data set .",
    "the significance of any detection of variability is then given by the value of the posterior odds ratio , @xmath30 . applied to our data , 62 events are found at the @xmath31 level , and 95 events have @xmath30 corresponding to at least @xmath32 .",
    "all but 5 of the flares discussed in this paper were among the @xmath31 detections .",
    "the remaining ones are detected at @xmath33 .",
    "but note that with the bayesian method we find variability in 182 lightcurves ( in contrast to our 52 flares ) .",
    "although the bayesian approach is sensitive to short events , we have persisted on the criteria explained in sect .",
    "[ subsect : method_det ] for two reasons : ( i ) while bayesian statistics are sensitive to all kinds of temporal variability , we are here interested in large flare events only .",
    "this makes an additional selection process necessary .",
    "( ii ) comparison with the classical flare search used in this paper has shown that the bayesian method needs further refinement .",
    "e.g. the outcome of the present algorithm used to search for flares depends sensitively on the value of the prior odds ratio .      before flares on different stellar groups",
    "are compared , it must be checked whether the composition of these samples is similar .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ms stars depends on their spectral type",
    ". therefore it would be desirable to separately investigate the flare activity from stars of different spectral types .",
    "however this is hindered by the low flare statistics .",
    "we have performed statistical tests where the flaring ttss , pleiads , and hyads have been compared regarding to their @xmath34 and hence spectral types .",
    "these tests have shown that it is justified to jointly analyse flares on all late - type stars , i.e. stars with spectral type g , k , and m.    we have shown that the relative number of flares increases when going from spectral types g to k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : detsens_spt ] ) .",
    "hereby , we have taken into account that the detection sensitivity for flares depends on the level of measured quiescent emission and hence on the spectral type .",
    "an interpretation is that deeper convection zones are favorable to the occurrence of surface flares .",
    "we found that in terms of absolute flare luminosity and energy output ttss surpass both pleiads and hyads .",
    "the mean flare luminosity of ttss ( @xmath35 ) is almost an order of magnitude higher than that for hyads ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the mean pleiades flare luminosity is intermediate between that for ttss and hyades stars with @xmath37 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : lf_lq ] and table  [ tab : l_gkm_mean ] ) .",
    "this is partly due to the different distances of our stellar samples which result in different detection sensitivities for flares .",
    "note , however , that this effect can explain only why no events with small @xmath38 are observed on ttss .",
    "but the lack of large events on hyades stars is real . in sect .",
    "[ sect : rate ] flare rates for ttss , pleiads , and hyads have been established from an evaluation of the observed flare durations and the total observing time . both , flare rate and mean flare luminosity decline with increasing stellar age .    the quiescent luminosity of hyades stars which showed a flare is larger than the average @xmath39 of hyads ( see sect .",
    "[ subsect : lumfunct ] ) .",
    "more than @xmath40% of the detected hyades stars are bright enough for detection of an average hyads flare .",
    "therefore , this result is not a selection effect , and we can conclude that only the most x - ray luminous hyades stars exhibit x - ray flares . the interesting question whether the enhanced x - ray luminosity of flaring hyades stars can be explained by their rotation rate can not be pursued with this set of data , because only for half of the flaring hyades stars measurements of @xmath15 are available .",
    "if magnetic interactions between star and disk take place , the field lines will constantly become twisted by differential rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this may provide an environment favorable for magnetic reconnection and related flare activity .",
    "six of the observed flare events can be attributed to cttss and 8 events to wttss .",
    "one of the flares on ttss occurred either on ddtau , a ctts , or on cztau , a wtts , both of which are not resolved in the _ rosat _ pspc observations .",
    "two - sample tests show clear indications that flares on cttss are more x - ray luminous than those on wttss ( see table  [ tab : l_gkm_2s ] ) .",
    "this holds no matter on which side the ambiguous event is counted .",
    "the flare rate is also slightly higher for cttss than for wttss , however with low significance .",
    "given the fact that quiescent x - ray emission of wttss is stronger than in cttss , this observation is surprising .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the stronger flare events on cttss may be due to violent interaction with their disks .      during four observations a second flare followed the first one ( see lightcurves of va334 , vb141 , rxj0437.5 + 1851b , and ttau in figs .",
    "[ fig : lcs_tts ]  and  [ fig : lcs_hya ] ) . from the number of observed flares and the total observing time",
    "the average duration between two flare events is estimated to be @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , from a statistical point of view it is very unlikely to observe so many unrelated ` double events ' .",
    "we note , that double flares have been reported in the optical . and have presented two flares that occurred within a few hours from the wtts v819tau .",
    "a possible interpretation of multiple flares is the star - disk scenario proposed by and mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "however , this model does not seem to be accurate for our objects , which are more evolved and in part are known not to possess disks .",
    "the statistical tests we have performed to discriminate between slow and fast rotators ( with boundary drawn at 20km / s ) reveal no dependence of individual flare parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 on the rotation rate .",
    "however , the flare frequency is about three times higher for fast rotators as compared to slow rotators : @xmath43% and @xmath44% .",
    "we have searched for evidence of binary interaction during x - ray flares by dividing our sample of flares into spectroscopic binaries and all other systems , i.e. wide ( or visual ) multiples and single stars , in which such interactions can not take place .",
    "the comparison of flare rates @xmath45 showed that large x - ray flares are significantly more frequent on spectroscopic binaries : @xmath46% and @xmath47% .",
    "we have taken account of all components in multiple systems when evaluating the flare rate .",
    "therefore , the difference in @xmath45 between close binaries and other stars seems indeed to indicate that magnetic interactions within close binaries leads to increased flare activity .",
    "but note , that interbinary events are expected to have longer durations because of the larger scale of the magnetic configuration .",
    "our statistical observations did not show an increase of the time scales for spectroscopic binaries .      from the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : hrs ] it can be concluded that for most of the observed events the spectral hardness has increased during the flare .",
    "due to the large uncertainties , however , the changes in the mean hardness are only marginal .",
    "but , note , that the uncertainties represent the standard deviation ( computed by taking into account upper / lower limits to the hardness ) and thus reproduce the spread in the data .",
    "we think that the x - ray emission of ttss is harder than that of pleiades and hyades stars ( see table  [ tab : hrs ] ) for two reasons : ( i ) because of their circumstellar envelope ttss suffer from much stronger absorption than pleiads and hyads , and absorption is stronger for pleiads than for hyads due to the larger distance of the former , ( ii ) the younger the stars , the stronger the activity , and therefore the harder the spectrum .",
    "we have determined flare rates for pms stars , pleiades and hyades on a large data set and found that all stars are observed during flares for less than 1% of the observing time .",
    "both frequency and strength of large x - ray flares decline after the pms phase .    to probe whether the activity changes in the presence of a circumstellar disk , e.g. as a result of magnetic interactions between the star and the disk ,",
    "we have compared flares on cttss and wttss .",
    "we find that flares on cttss are stronger and more frequent .",
    "to summarize , our analysis confirms that age and rotation influence the magnetic activity of late - type stars .",
    "all previous studies in this field have focused on the quiescent x - ray emission .",
    "now , for the first time the rotation - activity - age connection has been examined for x - ray flares .",
    "furthermore , from the sample of flares investigated here we find evidence that magnetic activity goes beyond solar - type coronal activity : on young stars interactions between the star and a circumstellar disk or the magnetic fields of close binary stars may play a role .",
