    "the presence of magnetic fields on galactic and extragalactic scales is a major unsolved puzzle in modern astrophysics .",
    "although the observational evidence supporting the existence of magnetic fields in large - scale structure is overwhelming , there is no consensus as to their origins .",
    "the standard paradigm for the creation of these fields is the dynamo mechanism , in which a small initial seed field is amplified by turbulence ( the @xmath1 effect ) and/or by differential rotation ( the @xmath2 effect ) . in principle , once a seed field is in place , it should be possible to follow its evolution and amplification from the collapse of structure and the operation of any relevant dynamos .    in recent papers , it has been argued that magnetic fields are generated in the early universe due to induced vorticity @xcite . in this paper , we put forward a new mechanism for the generation of seed fields from cosmological perturbations .",
    "we show that the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the pre - recombination era produces charge separations and currents on all scales , both of which contribute to magnetic fields , in addition to and independent of any fields generated via vorticity .",
    "these seed fields persist until the onset of significant gravitational collapse , at which point field amplification and dynamo processes may magnify such seeds to the @xmath3 fields observed today .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields from charge separations and currents in the early universe is a necessary consequence of structure formation .",
    "this paper calculates the magnitude of these seed fields , and it is shown that these seed fields may be sufficiently strong to account for all of the observed magnetic fields in large - scale structures .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section 2 gives an overview of the observational evidence for magnetic fields along with a brief theoretical picture of their generation .",
    "section 2 also contains an explanation of the novel idea that the early stages of structure formation in a perturbed universe generate magnetic fields .",
    "section 3 presents a detailed treatment of cosmological perturbations , with a specific view towards the creation and evolution of local charge separations and currents .",
    "section 4 explicitly calculates the seed magnetic fields that arise via this mechanism as a function of scale and epoch .",
    "finally , section 5 compares the results of this mechanism with competing theories .",
    "it also discusses avenues for future investigation of this topic , including possible observational signatures of the fields that would arise from this mechanism .",
    "magnetic fields with strength @xmath4 are seen in all gravitationally bound or collapsing structures in which the appropriate observations have been made @xcite .",
    "the four major methods used to study astrophysical magnetic fields are synchrotron radiation , faraday rotation , zeeman splitting , and polarization of starlight .",
    "these observational techniques are detailed in depth in @xcite , with faraday rotation often proving the most fruitful of the above methods .",
    "magnetic fields have been found in many different types of galaxies , in rich clusters , and in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "spiral galaxies , including our own , appear to have relatively large magnetic fields of @xmath5 on the scale of the galaxy @xcite , with some ( such as m82 ) containing fields up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "elliptical and irregular galaxies possess strong evidence for magnetic fields ( of order @xmath7 ) as well @xcite , although they are much more difficult to observe due to the paucity of free electrons in these classes of galaxies .",
    "coherence scales for magnetic fields in these galaxies , as opposed to spirals , are much smaller than the scale of the galaxy , of order @xmath8 to @xmath9 pc .",
    "furthermore , galaxies at moderate @xmath10 and high redshifts @xmath11 have been observed to require significant @xmath12 magnetic fields to explain their observed faraday rotations @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are also observed in structures larger than individual galaxies .",
    "the three main types of galaxy clusters are those with cooling flows , those with radio - halos , and those devoid of both .",
    "galaxy clusters with cooling flows are observed to have fields of @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite , the coma cluster ( a prime example of a radio - halo cluster ) is observed to have a field strength @xmath15 @xcite , while clusters selected to have neither cooling flows nor radio halos still exhibit indications of strong @xmath16@xmath17 fields @xcite . there",
    "even exists evidence for magnetic fields on extracluster scales .",
    "an excess of faraday rotation is observed for galaxies lying along the filament between the coma cluster and the cluster abell 1367 , consistent with an intercluster magnetic field of @xmath18@xmath19 @xcite . on the largest cosmological scales ,",
    "there exist only upper limits on magnetic fields , arising from observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite and from nucleosynthesis @xcite , setting limits that on scales @xmath20 , field strengths are @xmath21 .",
    "observational evidence for magnetic fields is found in galaxies of all types and in galaxy clusters , both locally and at high redshifts , wherever the appropriate observations can be made .",
    "a review of observational results can be found in @xcite . the theoretical picture of the creation of these fields ,",
    "however , is incomplete .",
    "fields of strength @xmath7 can be explained by the magnification of an initial , small seed field on galactic ( or larger ) scales by the dynamo mechanism @xcite .",
    "a protogalaxy ( or protocluster ) containing a magnetic field can have its field strength increased by many orders of magnitude through gravitational collapse @xcite , and can also be further amplified via various dynamos .",
    "dynamos which can amplify a small seed field into the large fields observed today involve helical turbulence @xmath22 and/or differential rotation @xmath23 .",
    "various types of these dynamos include the mean - field dynamo @xcite , the fluctuation dynamo @xcite , and merger - driven dynamos @xcite , among others .",
    "however , the dynamo mechanism does not explain the origin of such seed fields .",
    "while the initial seeds that grow into magnetic fields are anticipated to be small , they must still come from somewhere @xcite , as their existence is not explained by the dynamo mechanism alone .",
    "there are many mechanisms that can produce small - strength magnetic fields on astrophysically interesting scales , either through astrophysical or exotic processes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .",
    "exotic processes generally rely on new physics in the early universe , such as a first - order qcd phase transition @xcite , a first order electroweak phase transition @xcite , broken conformal invariance during inflation @xcite , specific inflaton potentials @xcite , or the presence of charged scalars during inflation @xcite .",
    "astrophysical mechanisms , in contrast , are generally better grounded in known physics , although they have difficulty generating sufficiently strong fields on sufficiently large scales .",
    "the difference in mobility between electrons and ions admits , under appropriate circumstances , the creation of large - scale currents and magnetic fields .",
    "seed magnetic fields arising from this difference in mobility between electrons and ions may be astrophysically generated via a variety of phenomena , including radiation - era vorticity @xcite , vorticity due to gas - dynamics in ionized plasma @xcite , stars @xcite , or from active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "although there are many candidates for producing the seed magnetic fields required by the dynamo mechanism , none has emerged as a definitive solution to the puzzle of explaining their origins .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this paper is that seed magnetic fields are generated by the scattering of photons with charged particles during the radiation era . unlike the mechanism of @xcite , which is disfavored @xcite due to its requirement of substantial primordial vorticity (",
    "although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an argument that some vorticity is necessary ) , the fields of interest here are generated by the earliest stages of structure formation , _ requiring no new physics_. ions ( taken to be protons , for simplicity ) and electrons are treated as separate fluids , with opposite charges but significantly different masses .",
    "the mass - weighted sums of their density and velocity fields will determine the evolution of the net baryonic component of the universe , and should agree with previous treatments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the differences of their density and velocity fields , however , provides a description of a local charge separation and a local current density , both of which contribute to magnetic fields . since cosmological perturbations , which serve as seeds for structure formation , exist on all scales",
    ", it is expected that seed magnetic fields will be generated on all scales by this mechanism . as the magnetic fields generated via this mechanism",
    "are in place at very early times , they possess the advantage over other astrophysical mechanisms that these fields will have optimally large amounts of time to be affected by amplification effects and various dynamos .",
    "the remainder of this paper focuses on calculating the magnitude of the magnetic fields generated by this process and discussing their cosmological ramifications .",
    "although the early universe is isotropic and homogeneous to a few parts in @xmath24 @xcite , it is these small density inhomogeneities , predicted by inflation to occur on all scales @xcite , that lead to all of the structure observed in the universe today . as it is the early epoch of structure formation that is of interest for the creation of magnetic fields ,",
    "we calculate the evolution of inhomogeneities in the linear regime of structure formation .",
    "the most sophisticated treatment of cosmological perturbations in the linear regime to date is that of @xcite , which provides evolution equations for an inhomogeneous universe containing a cosmological constant , dark matter , baryons , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "this section extends their treatment to encompass separate proton and electron components .",
    "the mass - weighted sum of protons and electrons will recover the usual baryon component , whereas the difference of the density fields represents a charge separation , and the difference of the velocities is a net current .",
    "the dynamics of any cosmological fluid can be obtained , in general , from the linear einstein equations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for earlier treatments ) .",

    "the master equations for each component of interest are computed explicitly in subsections 3.13.5 .",
    "the evolution equations which appear in this section for baryons , photons , light neutrinos , and cold dark matter are derived in much greater detail , including photon polarization , hydrogen and helium recombination , in both synchronous and conformal newtonian gauges , in @xcite .",
    "the cold dark matter component ( denoted by the subscript @xmath37 ) is collisionless and pressureless ; its evolution can be simply read off from equation ( [ evolution ] ) with @xmath38 to be @xmath39 any cold ( i.e. nonrelativistic ) , collisionless component will behave according to the dynamics given by equation ( [ cdm ] ) .      for massless ( or nearly massless ) particles ,",

    "( [ protons ] ) , a charge _ difference _ component as well as a sum component can be obtained .",
    "as the limits on a net electric charge asymmetry in the universe are very strict @xcite , we expect that any differences in densities and/or velocities of protons and electrons will not be strong enough to significantly alter the evolution of the other components of the universe .",
    "it is therefore expected that the analysis of baryonic matter , detailed in section 3.4 , will be unaffected by differences in proton and electron densities and velocities .",

    "the major result of this paper has been to demonstrate that seed magnetic fields of cosmologically interesting strengths and scales are necessarily generated by the same processes that cause structure formation .",
    "as overdensities in the early universe slowly grow during the radiation era , the differing photon interactions with protons and electrons create charge separations and currents of small magnitudes on all scales .",
    "these charge separations and currents grow in magnitude as the universe evolves , causing magnetic fields to grow as well . the magnetic power in a given mode peaks at approximately the time of horizon crossing , oscillating and falling slowly in amplitude after that .",

    ", it appears that the estimates for magnetic fields generated by vorticity are most accurately given by @xcite .",

    "the fractional charge asymmetry @xmath192 is of order @xmath143 at the scale of the peak of the power spectrum .",
    "when this information is combined with the fact that the streaming velocity at decoupling is @xmath193 , a current that yields magnetic field strengths of @xmath194 is produced .",
    "the field strengths expected from vorticity are somewhat less intuitive .",
    "although for an ideal fluid a rotational velocity is not generated from an initially longitudinal velocity if there is no vorticity at linear order @xcite , this does not remain the case if the imperfect nature of the fluid is properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "a reasonable `` upper - bound '' estimate of the magnetic field that arises from vorticity can be calculated from the angular momentum of a protogalaxy , yielding an angular velocity @xmath23 and therefore a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetic fields of magnitude @xmath195 would arise in the radiation era due to vorticity . from @xcite , an estimate of the angular momentum in the baryonic component of galaxies",
    "is @xmath196 , which yields a magnetic field of @xmath197 for a protogalaxy at recombination .",
    "this estimate of the field strength is reasonable as an upper bound , as the angular momentum from @xcite is for the entire protogalactic system , but the associated magnetic field energy may appear distributed across many smaller - scale modes .",
    "furthermore , this estimate is comparable to and consistent with the field strengths found in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore our assessment that their paper is the most correct of the works detailing magnetic fields arising from the vorticity generated by cosmological perturbations .",
    "it should not be surprising that the calculational frameworks of this paper and those involving magnetic fields arising from vorticity can lead to comparable results , as both calculations rely on second order quantities .",
    "the calculation of a vorticity in the context of cosmological perturbation theory requires a velocity term that is explicitly second order , whereas section 4 of this paper requires the convolution of two first order quantities . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "the two methods should yield comparable results .",
    "the results in this paper rely only on fields known to exist , and whether the contribution from charge separations and currents or from vorticity dominates can vary both with scale and from system to system .",
    "the usual evolution of cosmological perturbations leads in a straightforward manner to charge separations and currents , which necessarily arise from the differing interactions between protons and electrons with photons .",
    "as has been shown in section 4 , magnetic fields follow directly from these sources .    a seed field of @xmath198 , as generated via the charge separations and currents induced by structure formation , would provide an excellent candidate for the origins of cosmological magnetic fields . while field amplification due to gravitational collapse is negligible at the epoch of recombination , this will not be the case at all times . at recombination",
    ", the universe has only been matter - dominated for a brief time , and thus density perturbations have only grown by a small amount in that time , leading to an insignificant amplification of the field strength . as magnetic flux is frozen in , nonlinear collapse causes @xmath199 to increase by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , the major source of amplification of an initial seed field comes from dynamo effects , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "the key to solving the puzzle of the origin of cosmic magnetic fields lies in determining whether the seed fields produced by a given mechanism can be successfully amplified into the @xmath200 fields observed today .",
    "a major problem with many of the mechanisms that produce seed fields is that they produce weak fields at times insufficiently early for dynamo amplification to produce fields as large as @xmath201 g .",
    "the biermann mechanism , for instance , can produce seed fields of order @xmath202 g , but only at a redshift of @xmath203 .",
    "although those initial fields are larger than the @xmath204 g fields produced by the growth of cosmic structure , the fact that magnetic fields from structure formation are in place at @xmath205 makes them an extremely attractive candidate for the seeds of cosmic magnetic fields . as argued by @xcite , a seed field as small as @xmath206 g at recombination could possibly be amplified into a @xmath207 g field today . clearly , more work on understanding dynamo amplification is necessary before a definitive solution to the puzzle of cosmic magnetic fields can emerge .",
    "one interesting mechanism worth investigating further is for the cosmic seed fields generated by density perturbations to seed supermassive black holes .",
    "it is known that the magnetic field energy in active galactic nuclei and quasars is comparable to the magnetic field energy in an entire galaxy .",
    "however , these structures can not generate their own magnetic fields from nothing ; they require a pre - existing seed field .",
    "it therefore appears to be a reasonable possibility that the seed fields generated by cosmic structure formation could provide the necessary fields to seed supermassive black holes .",
    "the resultant amplification via collapse and dynamo effects could explain the origin of large - scale magnetic structures in the universe .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields exist at the epoch of recombination , they may be detectable by upcoming experiments .",
    "the results shown in figure [ bgraph ] provide a prediction of large - scale magnetic fields at the epoch of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "sufficiently large magnetic fields on large scales at recombination may be detectable by planck @xcite , although current estimates of their sensitivity indicate that the field strengths predicted in this paper @xmath208 would be significantly out of range of planck s capabilities @xmath209 .",
    "nonetheless , a knowledge of the field strengths at recombination allow for predictions of cmb photon polarizations and faraday rotation , both of which may be , at least in principle , observable .",
    "it is also of interest to note that any primordial charge asymmetry or large - scale currents ( and therefore magnetic fields ) created in the very early universe will be driven away by these dynamics .",
    "equation ( [ solve ] ) has an approximate solution for @xmath140 which is critically ( exponentially ) damped at redshift @xmath210 , capable of reducing any pre - existing charge or current by as much as a factor of @xmath211 .",
    "as this factor is extraordinarily large , it is easy to conclude that any initial @xmath117 or @xmath134 will be driven quickly to the value given by equations ( [ dsoln ] ) and ( [ tsoln ] ) at the epoch of critical damping .",
    "this result is independent of @xmath146 and ought to be applicable even to a charge asymmetry on large scales , perhaps approaching that of the present horizon . as a result of this reduction of pre - existing charges or currents ,",
    "the late - time @xmath212 solutions obtained in this paper for charge separations , currents , and magnetic fields ought to be independent of the initial conditions for @xmath117 , @xmath134 , and @xmath199 in the early universe .",
    "overall , the dynamics of ions , electrons , and photons during the radiation era necessarily leads to charge separations and currents on all scales , which in turn generate magnetic fields .",
    "these fields supersede any pre - existing fields and are in place prior to substantial gravitational collapse .",
    "thus , the creation of charge separations and currents from the evolution of cosmological perturbations emerges as a promising and well - motivated new candidate to explain the origins of cosmic magnetic fields .",
