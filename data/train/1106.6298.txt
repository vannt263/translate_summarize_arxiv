    "in the 60s and 70s rochlin , lickorish and kirby established a remarkable connection between links and 3manifolds .",
    "they showed that every 3manifold can be obtained by surgery ( on @xmath0 ) along framed links , and surgeries along two links give the same 3manifold if and only if the links are related by a sequence of kirby moves .",
    "this allows us to think of 3manifolds as equivalence classes of framed links modulo the relation generated by kirby moves .",
    "after the discovery of the jones polynomial in 1984 , knot theory experienced the transformation from an esoteric branch of pure mathematics to a dynamic research field with deep connections to mathematical physics , the theory of integrable and dynamic systems , von neumann algebras , representation theory , homological algebra , algebraic geometry , etc . among important developments were the constructions of _",
    "quantum link invariants _ ( generalization of the jones polynomial ) , and of _ the kontsevich integral _ ( universal finite type invariant ) .    the quantum link invariants were extended to 3manifolds by witten and reshetikhin  turaev ( wrt ) , the lift of the kontsevich integral to 3manifolds was defined by le ",
    "ohtsuki ( lmo ) .",
    "however , while the relationship between the kontsevich integral and quantum link invariants is simple , the relationship between the lmo invariant and the wrt invariants is much more complicated and remains mysterious in many cases .",
    "let us explain this in more details .",
    "the kontsevich integral of a knot takes values in a certain algebra @xmath1 of chord diagrams .",
    "simple lie algebra and its module define a map @xmath2 $ ] called a weight system .",
    "one important result of le ",
    "murakami and kassel is that the following diagram commutes , where the @xmath3 weight system uses the 2dimensional defining representation .    & & & & + & ^ & & ^q = e^h & + \\ { } & & & & + & _ & & _",
    "_ 2 & + & & ( s^1 ) & &    in particular , this proves that the kontsevich integral dominates the jones polynomial , and similarly all quantum link invariants coming from lie algebras .",
    "hence in addition to being universal for finite type , the kontsevich integral is also universal for all quantum link invariants .",
    "it is conjectured that the kontsevich integral separates knots .",
    "does there exist a similar commutative diagram for 3manifolds ?",
    "the quantum wrt invariant associates with a compact orientable 3manifold @xmath4 , a root of unity @xmath5 and a semi  simple lie algebra , say @xmath6 for simplicity , a complex number @xmath7 .",
    "the lmo invariant takes values in a certain algebra @xmath8 of feynman diagrams .",
    "every semi ",
    "simple lie algebra defines a weight system map from @xmath9 to @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "hence , we have    & & & & + & ^_m ( ) & & & + \\ { } & & & & + & _ & & _ _ 2 & + & & & &    the image of the composition of the two bottom arrows is known as the ohtsuki series @xcite .",
    "ohtsuki showed that for any rational homology 3sphere @xmath4 and a root of unity @xmath5 of _ prime _ order @xmath11 , the first @xmath12 coefficients , modulo @xmath11 , of the ohtsuki series are determined by @xmath7 .",
    "this is shown by the dotted arrow in the diagram .",
    "this result of ohtsuki raises many interesting questions : does there exist any relationship between the lmo and wrt invariants at roots of unity of non  prime order ? is the whole set of wrt invariants determined by the lmo invariant ?",
    "the discovery of the series prompted ohtsuki to build the theory of finite type invariants of homology 3spheres , which was further developed by goussarov and habiro .",
    "in the 90s , habegger , garoufalidis and beliakova showed that the lmo invariant is trivial if the first betti number of a 3manifold is bigger than 3 , and for the betti numbers 1,2 and 3 , the lmo invariant is determined by the classical casson  walker  lescop invariant .",
    "however , in the case of rational homology 3spheres , the lmo invariant is more powerful , it is a universal finite type invariant in the goussarov - habiro sense .",
    "the relationship between the lmo and wrt invariants at non  prime roots of unity remained open for quite a while .",
    "this is because all known techniques heavily rely on the fact that the order of the root is prime and can not be extended to other roots .",
    "however , recently habiro s theory @xcite of unified invariants provided a complete solution of this problem in the case of integral homology 3spheres . in this case , also the question of integrality of the wrt invariants at",
    "non  prime roots of unity was solved simultaneously . though intensively studied ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references there ) , the integrality of wrt invariant was previously known for prime roots of unity only .",
    "note that a conceptual solution of the integrality problem is of primary importance for any attempt of categorification of the wrt invariants ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the unification of the wrt invariants was initiated in 2006 by habiro .",
    "for any integral homology 3sphere @xmath4 , habiro @xcite constructed a _ unified invariant _ @xmath13 whose evaluation at any root of unity coincides with the value of the wrt invariant at that root .",
    "habiro s unified invariant @xmath13 is an element of the following ring ( habiro s ring ) @xmath14 } { ( ( q;q)_k ) } ,   \\qquad \\text { where } \\quad ( q;q)_k = \\prod_{j=1}^k ( 1-q^j).\\ ] ] every element @xmath15 can be written ( non  uniquely ) as an infinite sum @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath18 , a root of unity , only a finite number of terms on the right hand side are not zero , hence the evaluation @xmath19 is well  defined and is an algebraic integer . however , the fact that the unified invariant belongs to the habiro ring is stronger than just integrality of @xmath7 .",
    "the habiro ring has beautiful arithmetic properties .",
    "every element @xmath20 can be considered as a function whose domain is the set of roots of unity .",
    "moreover , there is a natural taylor series for @xmath21 at every root of unity . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that two elements @xmath22 are the same if and only if their taylor series at a root of unity coincide .",
    "in addition , each function @xmath20 is totally determined by its values at , say , infinitely many roots of order @xmath23 . due to these properties the habiro ring",
    "is also called a ring of `` analytic functions at roots of unity '' .",
    "thus belonging to @xmath24 means that the collection of the wrt invariants is far from a random collection of algebraic integers ; together they form a nice function .",
    "general properties of the habiro ring imply that for any integral homology 3sphere @xmath4 , the taylor expansion of the unified invariant @xmath13 at @xmath25 coincides with the ohtsuki series and dominates wrt invariants of @xmath4 at all roots of unity ( not only of prime order ) .",

    "+ & & & ^_2 _ &    by @xmath26 we denoted here the set of integral homology 3spheres . in particular , this shows that ohtsuki series has integral coefficients ( which was conjectured by lawrence and first proved by rozansky ) .",
    "recently , habiro ring found applications in algebraic geometry for constructing varieties over the non  existing field of one element @xcite .      in @xcite , we give a full generalization of the habiro theory to rational homology 3spheres .",
    "this requires completely new techniques coming from number theory , commutative algebra , quantum group and knot theory .",
    "let us explain this in more details .",
    "assume @xmath4 is a rational homology 3sphere with @xmath27 , where for a finite group @xmath28 we denote by @xmath29 the number of its elements",

    "there is a decomposition @xmath34 , where @xmath35 dominates the set @xmath36 . if @xmath33 , then @xmath30 coincides with habiro s @xmath13 .",

    "the commutative diagram tells us that lmo invariant determines @xmath37 , or the set of wrt invariants at roots of unity coprime with @xmath32 .",
    "since there is no direct way to obtain power series in @xmath45 from the lmo invariant , we conjecture the existence of the refined universal finite type invariant , dominating our power series . on the physical level of rigor",
    ", this means that the new refined invariant should capture more than just the contribution of flat connections from the chern  simons theory .",
    "the methods used in the unification of the wrt invariants also led to the full solution of the integrality problem for quantum @xmath52 and @xmath53 wrt invariants . in @xcite",
