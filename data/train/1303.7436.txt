    "the evolution of the milky way is clearly manifested by its structure formation and the enrichment of chemical elements heavier than those stemming from the primordial nucleosynthesis , and the latter resulting from the consumption of gas to star formation .",
    "gas collapses to form stars , and various chemical elements are created by nucleosynthesis processes in stars . through several ways , such as mass loss and supernova explosion ( during which heavier elements can also be produced ) , the newly synthesized nuclear products go back into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "then the gas containing newly produced material forms stars of next generation , and the processes above will repeat again and again . the cycle between ism and stars",
    "continuously enrich the milky way chemically on both the variety and the amount of chemical elements .",
    "thus the dynamical behaviors of gas and stars would significantly influence the galactic chemical evolution and contribute to form the present chemical features of the milky way .    to understand how the galaxy formed and have evolved on both structure and chemical composition , models of the chemical evolution of the milky way play an important role in the research . from the earliest closed - box simple model to the open models with gas infall from outside of the galaxy @xcite , and to the models including radial gas flow ( * ? ? ?",

    "* the first one does nt relax ira ) , the chemical evolution model of the milky way has been developing all the time . up to now",
    "the effects of gas part on the galactic chemical evolution has been studied in detail .",
    "however , the topics of how stars evolve dynamically in galactic disks and its effects on galactic chemical evolution have received less attention in the aforementioned works .",
    "one main reason resides that it has been believed for decades that stars would remain at roughly their birth radii throughout their lives .",
    "thus , according to the mechanism of chemical enrichment , there would be a perfect relation between the age and metallicity of stars ( the so - called age - metallicity relation , amr ) at a certain position .",
    "for example , in the solar neighborhood the metallicity of stars decreases with the increasing of their age .",
    "this relation has been adopted by many chemical evolution models in the last decades of years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the influences of the dynamical behaviors of stars on the galactic chemical evolution have not been paid enough attention .    however , as the enrichment of observational data and the development of theoretical studies in recent years , the classic picture has been replaced by new knowledge .",
    "observationally , the tight age - metallicity relation has not been found in recent data . on the contrary",
    "the distribution of the age and metallicity of stars in the solar neighborhood is flat together with large scatter @xcite , and the scatter would increase with the increasing age @xcite .",
    "it suggests that stars born at other regions with different age and metallicities could appear in the solar neighborhood through migration . besides , the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in the solar neighborhood , which acts as a constraint of the chemical evolution model , obtained by @xcite shows that old stars have a considerably broader distribution than young stars while the peak always remains around the solar value , suggesting that the wings of mdf could mostly comprise stars born at various galactocentric radii and migrated to the current position over different timescales .",
    "theoretically , @xcite has distinguished two drivers of radial migration : by scattering at an orbital resonance or by non - resonant scattering by a molecular cloud , the angular momentum of a star can be changed so that the star s guiding - center radius changes and the star s entire orbit moves inwards or outwards depending on whether its angular momentum is lost or gained , or the angular momentum of a star can be maintained while the star s epicycle amplitude increases so that the star contributes to the density over a wider range of radii .",
    "they call them churning and blurring respectively .",
    "besides , @xcite identified another radial migration mechanism in barred galaxies , namely the resonance overlap of the bar and spiral structure induces a nonlinear response leading to a strong redistribution of angular momentum in the disk . as a consequence , besides gas flows , the radial stellar migration is another important component that should be considered in the galactic chemical evolution model .    when the radial stellar migration is included in chemical evolution models , the classical tight correlation between age and metallicity is relaxed , and this relation becomes effectively an additional constraint independent from the metallicity distribution .",
    "abundance gradients are also very important constraints for the galactic chemical evolution model . as suggested by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "since the migration of stars makes it possible to transport materials to anyplace along the disk no matter where they originally located , the mixture of chemical elements over large range of radius would reduce the differences of abundances between different regions along the disk and flatten the abundance gradients .",
    "this paper is to study the influence of radial stellar migration in the disk on the chemical evolution of the milky way and the degree to which it could affect the formation of some galactic typical chemical features .",
    "we organize it as follows : in section 2 we describe the reference models used in this work ; the description of the radial stellar migration is presented in section 3 ; section 4 and 5 show the stellar ejecta and the observational data adopted here , respectively ; in section 6 we report and discuss our results ; and finally we draw our main conclusions in section 7 .",
    "the model adopted here is based on the model of @xcite , which is an open model where the disk forms gradually by accretion of protogalactic gas and radial gas flow exists .",
    "the disk is divided into n concentric rings or shells , each of which is of 1  kpc wide ; and in each ring the gaseous component and its chemical abundances evolve due to : 1 .",
    "star formation which locks up gas into stars ; 2 .",
    "infall of primordial protogalactic gas ; 3 .",
    "the ejecta of stars which were born in the ring or migrated from other rings , bringing the enriched material back to the interstellar medium ; 4 .",
    "gas exchange with the neighboring rings as a result of radial gas flows .",

    "radial gas flow in galactic disk can be driven by several mechanisms as introduced in @xcite , such as the difference between the angular momentum of the infalling gas and that of the circular motions in the disk , the viscosity in the gas layer , and the interactions between gas and the spiral structure . as the radial gas flows are expected to be inflows over most of the disk @xcite , we only consider inflows in our model , and we describe the gas inflows following the prescriptions in @xcite .",

    "the g - dwarf metallicity distribution of the solar neighborhood should be different from the results from star - static models ( see figure [ gdwarf ] ) .",

    "because of the higher density of stars in the inner disk , the migrated portion would favor metal - rich stars . as a consequence , the migrated metal - rich stars could compensate the metal - poor tail of the local chemical evolution , and the profiles of the g - dwarf metallicity distributions we derived become narrower and taller with less metal - poor stars , while the models with extreme condition really produce the extreme results , much more metal - rich stars .",
    "thus , the stellar migration can be another solution to the `` g - dwarf problem '' .",

    "we show the distributions of birth radii of the stars that appear at the solar neighbourhood at present .",
    "as we already know , the stars in the solar neighbourhood could have been born in a large range of radius and migrated to their present positions .",
    "while most stars come from the local area , a large part of the stars come from inner disk , as a consequence of the higher density of stars there , which is more obvious for the models adopting gama distribution for stellar migration in which stars in inner disk have a preference to migrate outwards .",
    "these phenomenon are more obvious for the extreme condition . for our best model gcm2 g , we show the distribution of the birth radii of stars in different ages that appear at the solar neighbourhood at present in figure [ abr ] .",
    "we can see that with the age increasing , the birth radii of stars cover larger range of the disk , and more stars come from inner disk , which is consistent with the stellar migration theory .",
    "we also show the time - dependent variation of the birth radii distributions for stars in the solar vicinity from the galactic evolution time @xmath106 to @xmath107 in figure [ hrt ] .",
    "as the time goes , stars migrate for longer time , and more stars born at farther places come to the solar vicinity . particularly for the stars from inner disk , we think that after about @xmath108 they significantly enrich the stellar abundance in the solar vicinity , and this is also an explanation for the change of the g - dwarf metallicity relation caused by stellar migration which is shown in figure [ gdwarf ] .         to @xmath107.,width=326 ]    the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) of stars in the solar neighbourhood is an important factor when considering stellar migration . as a consequence of radial stellar migration , the solar neighbourhood consists of stars of different ages and metallicities coming from different radii , and they scatter the classic amr to an age - metallicity distribution ( amd ) , as roughly shown in figure [ amr ] .",

    "the panels on the first and second row are for models with constant disk formation time scale and inside - out disk formation scenario , respectively . from the left column",
    ", we can see that our models can reproduce the observational oxygen abundance and [ fe / h ] distributions along the galactic disk on the whole . in the right column",
    "we only compare the results from models .",
    "the abundance distributions in each panel , produced by the models adopting the same galactic disk formation scenario , differ very little , almost coincide with each other .",
    "being inconsistent with previous predictions , looking from the whole radius range , the distributions of chemical element abundances along the disk have not flattened after radial stellar migration , even in the extreme condition of radial stellar migration the abundance gradients have also not changed much .",
    "the specific values of the abundance gradient in the solar vicinity calculated by models are shown in table [ gradientvalue ] .",
    "these gradients are a little flatter than the typical values which are obtained by fitting the whole data set along the disk , such as for the iron gradient : -0.070 by @xcite ; -0.052 by @xcite ; -0.051 by @xcite ; -0.062 by @xcite , and for the oxygen gradient : -0.044 by @xcite ; -0.06 by @xcite ; -0.065 by @xcite ; -0.055 by @xcite .",
    "however , if only focus on the local gradient in the solar vicinity , we can find the gradient values for iron : -0.029 by @xcite ; -0.03 by @xcite ; -0.044 by @xcite ; -0.042 by @xcite , which are consistent with our model results",
    ".    then we may infer that the radial stellar migration can not lead to significant flattening of the chemical abundance gradients .",
    "this is not difficult to understand . as the important chemical contributors are massive stars , which have a short lifetime , they contribute mostly around their places of birth .",
    "those migrated stars , born from far away having big difference in metallicity with the local stars , only contribute a small fraction to the local ism and can not change the chemical abundance of the local ism essentially ; and the chemical contributions by stars from nearby differ not much enough to change the abundance gradients significantly .",
    "however , as the migration is a motion of stars , its influence on the stellar chemical abundance is more significant",
    ". it can flatten the radial gradient of the mean chemical abundance of stars . as in figure",
    "[ sag ] , we show the radial distributions of the mean iron and oxygen abundance of stars in four age groups by model gcm2 and gcm2 g . since older stars have migrated for more time , the influences of radial stellar migration on them are more significant , making their chemical abundances higher and abundance gradients flatter in the solar neighborhood , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "however , in the outer disk , as the disk there has formed much later and stars have a tendency to migrate inward under gama - distribution migration , the chemical enrichment is slower and the mean stellar abundance gets lower for younger stars . thus young stars have steeper abundance gradients in model gcm2 g than in model gcm2 . besides , the most significant effect of the migrated stars on the chemical abundance at a position is they can scatter the abundance of stars there from a relatively concentrated value to a range .",
    "as shown in figure [ stargradient ] , the shade shows the amount of star with a certain abundance value , which is calculated by model gcm2 g as an example , and as a comparison the solid lines show the chemical abundance of the ism .",
    "we can see that although the abundances of stars spread in a range , the abundance values which most stars possess at each radius still coincide with that of the ism .",
    "this , from another way , suggests that the radial stellar migration can not change the abundance gradient of the ism essentially .",
    "moreover , as the gradients here are not very steep , the effect of scatter becomes more significant .",
    "the types of the lines are of the same meaning in figure [ ogradient ] .",
    "[ fegradient ]    we also predict that the abundance gradients of the milky way , such as the gradients of oxygen and iron , will not flatten under the influence of radial stellar migration in the future . on the contrary , while the gradients have kept steepening for the past 13.7  gyr , they will continue steepening in the future , but with slower speed , as shown in figure [ gradients - time ] .",

    "the aim of this paper is to study the influence of radial stellar migration on the chemical evolution of the milky way , especially for the galactic abundance gradients .",
    "we did our research mainly based on two detailed galactic chemical evolution models : one adopts a constant disk formation time scale for all the galactocentric radii ; the other adopts an inside - out disk formation in which the disk formation time scale increase with radius .",
    "according to the basic point , we found the optimal forms for the radial gas flow and values for the parameters in the two models respectively to make them reproduce the observational data well .",
    "then we added the radial stellar migration to these two models , where we used the distribution functions to model the radial stellar migration , and tested its effects in standard and extreme conditions , respectively . from the new models we derived the elemental abundance distributions along the galactic radius and other important information .",
    "* when stars migrate radially on the galactic disk , the solar neighborhood is not only assembled from local stars , but also from stars originating from the inner and outer galactic disk .",
    "as there are more stars in the inner disk which are of higher metallicity , more metal - rich stars would migrate to the solar neighbourhood . as a consequence ,",
    "the profiles of the g - dwarf metallicity distributions produced by our models considering the stellar migration are narrower and taller with smaller metal - poor tails than those produced by the models without stellar migration .",
    "thus , the radial stellar migration can be another solution to the `` g - dwarf problem '' . * as model gcm2",
    "adopting an inside - out disk formation can produce taller and narrower g - dwarf metallicity distribution than model gcm1 adopting a constant disk formation time scale , it seems that the radial stellar migration and the inside - out disk formation have some similar effects in building up the g - dwarf metallicity distribution .",
    "so whether the galactic disk has formed inside - out or how it has formed in an inside - out way is still a question . *",
    "as stars could migrate radially , the stars in the solar neighbourhood could have been born in a large range of radius on the galactic disk .",
    "since older stars have migrated for more time , their birth radii cover larger range of the disk than younger stars , with larger fraction of them coming from inner disk . on the whole , under our assumption of the stellar migration ,",
    "most stars in the solar neighbourhood come from the local area , while a large fraction comes from the inner disk , and fewer come from the outer disk . *",
    "the classic amr is scattered by the stellar migration to an age - metallicity distribution , while a slope in the distribution is preserved and stars from the same birth radius still follow a classic local amr . * we compared the results of models including radial stellar migration with those obtained from models without migration . looking from the whole radius range , we find that the distributions of chemical element abundances along the disk havent changed much after radial stellar migration .",
    "different from previous prediction , we infer that the radial stellar migration can not change the chemical abundance gradients of the ism essentially",
    ". however , it can flatten the radial gradients of the mean chemical abundance of stars .",
    "since older stars have migrated for more time , they possess flatter abundance gradients than younger stars . *",
    "the most significant effect of radial stellar migration on the chemical abundance at a position is it scatters the abundance of stars there from a relatively concentrated value to a range , while keep the dominant abundance value consistent with the abundance of the ism . *",
    "according to the model results , we predict that the chemical abundance gradients of the milky way , such as the gradients of oxygen and iron , will continue steepening in the future , but with slower speed .",
    "finally , we should point out that we just use two basic chemical evolution models as a foundation to study the effects of radial stellar migration .",
    "we are not sure our models can produce the best results to fit all the observational data . only according to our models in this paper",
    ", we also can not decide what kind of the combination of disk formation scenario , gas flow , stellar migration and the related parameters can make one model reproduce the observational data best .",
    "but we believe that our conclusions can , to a certain extent , tell the influences of radial stellar migration on the galactic chemical evolution , and more further detailed research is still needed .",
