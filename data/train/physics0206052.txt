    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to nonlinear rms / rate equations for averaged quantities related to some particular case of nonlinear vlasov - maxwell equations .",
    "our starting point is a model and approach proposed by r. c. davidson e.a .",
    "[ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "according to [ 1 ] we consider electrostatic approximation for a thin beam .",
    "this approximation is a particular important case of the general reduction from statistical collective description based on vlasov - maxwell equations to a finite number of ordinary differential equations for the second moments related quantities ( beam radius and emittance ) . in our case",
    "these reduced rms / rate equations also contain some disribution averaged quantities besides the second moments , e.g. self - field energy of the beam particles .",
    "such model is very efficient for analysis of many problems related to periodic focusing accelerators , e.g. heavy ion fusion and tritium production .",
    "so , we are interested in the understanding of collective properties , nonlinear dynamics and transport processes of intense non - neutral beams propagating through a periodic focusing field . our approach is based on the variational - wavelet approach from [ 3]-[16],[17 ] that allows to consider rational type of nonlinearities in rms / rate dynamical equations containing statistically averaged quantities also .",
    "the solution has the multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes ( waveletons ) , which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying internal hidden scales .",
    "we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical process . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time / space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode .",
    "starting from some electrostatic approximation of vlasov - maxwell system and rms / rate dynamical models in part 2 we consider the approach based on variational - wavelet formulation in part 3 .",
    "we give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the bases of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes .",
    "our solutions are parametrized by the solutions of a number of reduced standard algebraical problems .",
    "we present also numerical modelling based on our analytical approach .",
    "in thin - beam approximation with negligibly small spread in axial momentum for beam particles we have in larmor frame the following electrostatic approximation for vlasov - maxwell equations : @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is normalized electrostatic potential and @xmath3 is distribution function in transverse phase space @xmath4 with normalization @xmath5 where @xmath6 is self - field perveance which measures self - field intensity [ 1 ] . introducing self - field energy @xmath7 we have obvious equations for root - mean - square beam radius @xmath8 @xmath9 and unnormalized beam emittance @xmath10 @xmath11 which appear after averaging second - moments quantities regarding distribution function @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14 where the term @xmath15 may be fixed in some interesting cases , but generally we have it only as average @xmath16 regarding distribution @xmath12 .",
    "anyway , the rate equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) represent reasoanable reductions for the second - moments related quantities from the full nonlinear vlasov - poisson system . for trivial distributions davidson e.a .",
    "[ 1 ] found additional reductions . for kv distribution ( step - function density ) the second rate equation ( 8) is trivial , @xmath17=const and we have only one nontrivial rate equation for rms beam radius ( 7 ) .",
    "the fixed - shape density profile ansatz for axisymmetric distributions in [ 1 ] also leads to similar situation : emittance conservation and the same envelope equation with two shifted constants only .",
    "accordingly to our approach [ 3]-[16 ] , [ 17 ] which allows us to find exact solutions as for vlasov - like systems ( 1)-(3 ) as for rms - like systems ( 7),(8 ) we need not to fix particular case of distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "our consideration is based on the following multiscale @xmath18-mode anzatz : @xmath19 @xmath20 formulae ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) provide multiresolution representation for variational solutions of system ( 1)-(3 ) [ 3]-[16],[17 ] .",
    "each high - localized mode / harmonics @xmath21 corresponds to level @xmath22 of resolution from the whole underlying infinite scale of spaces : @xmath23 where the closed subspace @xmath24 corresponds to level j of resolution , or to scale j. the construction of such tensor algebra based multiscales bases are considered in [ 17 ] .",
    "we ll consider rate equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) as the following operator equation .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 be an arbitrary nonlinear ( rational in dynamical variables ) first - order matrix differential operators with matrix dimension d ( d=4 in our case ) corresponding to the system of equations ( 7)-(8 ) , which act on some set of functions @xmath28 from @xmath29 : @xmath30 or @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "let us consider now the n mode approximation for solution as the following expansion in some high - localized wavelet - like basis : @xmath33 we shall determine the coefficients of expansion from the following variational conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 3]-[16 ] ) : @xmath34 we have exactly @xmath35 algebraical equations for @xmath35 unknowns @xmath36 .",
    "so , variational approach reduced the initial problem ( 7 ) , ( 8) to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage . as a result",
    "we have the following reduced algebraical system of equations ( rsae ) on the set of unknown coefficients @xmath37 of expansion ( 14 ) : @xmath38 where operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are algebraization of rhs and lhs of initial problem ( 12 ) .",
    "@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are the coefficients of lhs ( rhs ) of the initial system of differential equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) and as consequence are coefficients of rsae .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 are multiindexes , by which are labelled @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the other coefficients of rsae ( 15 ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the degree of polynomial operator @xmath26 ( 12 ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the degree of polynomial operator @xmath27 ( 12 ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "according to [ 3]-[16 ] we may extend our approach to the case when we have additional constraints as ( 3 ) on the set of our dynamical variables @xmath53=\\{@xmath54 , @xmath55 and additional averaged terms ( 4 ) , ( 9 ) also . in this case by using the method of lagrangian multipliers we again may apply the same approach but for the extended set of variables . as a result",
    "we receive the expanded system of algebraical equations analogous to the system ( 15 ) .",
    "then , after reduction we again can extract from its solution the coefficients of expansion ( 13 ) .",
    "it should be noted that if we consider only truncated expansion ( 13 ) with n terms then we have the system of @xmath56 algebraical equations with the degree @xmath57 and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with the degree of the initial system .",
    "so , after all we have the solution of the initial nonlinear ( rational ) problem in the form @xmath58 where coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical ( polynomial ) problem rsae ( 15 ) .",
    "consequently , we have a parametrization of the solution of the initial problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem ( 15 )",
    ". the problem of computations of coefficients @xmath45 ( 17 ) , @xmath61 ( 16 ) of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly solved in wavelet approach .",
    "the obtained solutions are given in the form ( 18 , ( 19 ) , where @xmath62 are proper wavelet bases functions ( e.g. , periodic or boundary ) .",
    "it should be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding ( phase)space / time coordinates .",
    "in contrast with different approaches formulae ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and represent dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion .",
    "our n mode construction ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) gives the following general multiscale representation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 are represented by some family of ( nonlinear ) eigenmodes and gives the full multiresolution / multiscale representation in the high - localized wavelet bases .",
    "the corresponding decomposition is presented on fig .",
    "2 and two - dimensional localized mode ( waveleton ) contribution to distribution function is presented on fig.1 . as a result",
    "we can construct different ( stable ) patterns from high - localized ( coherent ) structures in spatially - extended stochastic systems with complex collective behaviour .",
