    "a calorimeter was constructed as part of the instrumentation of the jefferson lab ( jlab ) hall a experiment e99 - 114 , `` exclusive compton scattering on the proton ''  @xcite , the schematic layout for which is shown in fig .  [ fig : layout ] .",
    "the study of elastic photon scattering provides important information about nucleon structure , which is complementary to that obtained from elastic electron scattering @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the real compton scattering ( rcs ) process at large photon energies and large scattering angles are rather scarce , due mainly to the absence of high luminosity facilities with suitable high - resolution photon detectors .",
    "such data are however crucial , as the basic mechanism of the rcs reaction is the subject of active debate  @xcite . the only data available before the jlab e99 - 114 experiment were obtained at cornell about 30 years ago  @xcite .",
    "[ tbh ]        the construction of the cebaf ( continuous electron beam accelerator facility ) accelerator has led to an extension of many experiments with electron and photon beams in the gev energy range and much improved precision .",
    "this is the result of a number of fundamental improvements to the electron beam , including a 100% duty cycle , low emittance and high polarization , in addition to new dedicated target and detector systems .",
    "the cebaf duty factor provides an improvement of a factor of 15 compared to the best duty factor of a beam extracted from a synchrotron , at a similar instantaneous rate in the detectors .    in 1994",
    "work began on the development of a technique for an rcs experiment at jlab , leading in 1997 to the instigation of a large - scale prototyping effort .",
    "the results of the subsequent test runs in 1998 and 1999  @xcite provided sufficient information for the final design of the apparatus presented in the present article .",
    "the fully realized physics experiment took place in 2002 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) at a photon - nucleon luminosity which was a factor of 1300 higher than in the previous cornell experiment .",
    "the experimental technique involves utilizing a mixed electron - photon beam which is incident on a liquid hydrogen target and passes to a beam dump .",
    "the scattered photons are detected in the calorimeter , while the recoiling protons are detected in a high resolution magnetic spectrometer ( hrs - l ) . a magnet between the hydrogen target and the calorimeter deflects the scattered electrons , which then allows for clean separation between compton scattering and elastic e - p scattering events .",
    "the data acquisition electronics ( daq ) is shielded by a 4 inch thick concrete wall from the beam dump and the target .",
    "figure  [ fig : picture ] shows a photograph of the experimental set - up with the calorimeter in the center .",
    "the experiment relied on a proton - photon time coincidence and an accurate measurement of the proton - photon kinematic correlation for event selection .",
    "the improvement in the event rate over the previous measurement was achieved through the use of a mixed electron - photon beam , which in turn required a veto detector in front of the calorimeter or the magnetic deflection of the scattered electron @xcite . in order to ensure redundancy and cross - checking ,",
    "both a veto and deflection magnet were designed and built .",
    "the fact that a clean photon beam was not required meant that the photon radiator could be situated very close to the hydrogen target , leading to a much reduced background near the beam line and a dramatic reduction of the photon beam size .",
    "this small beam size in combination with the large dispersion in the hrs - l proton detector system @xcite resulted in very good momentum and angle resolution for the recoiling proton without the need for a tracking detector near the target , where the background rate is high .",
    "good energy and coordinate resolutions were key features of the photon detector design goals , both of which were significantly improved in the jlab experiment as compared to the cornell one . an energy resolution of at least 10% is required to separate cleanly rcs events from electron bremsstrahlung and neutral pion events . in order to separate further the background from neural pion photo - production , which is the dominant component of the high - energy background in this measurement , a high angular resolution between proton and photon detectors is crucial .",
    "this was achieved on the photon side by constructing a highly segmented calorimeter of 704 channels .",
    "the rcs experiment was the first instance of a calorimeter being operated at an effective electron - nucleon luminosity of @xmath1  @xmath2/s @xcite ( a 40  @xmath3a electron beam on a 6% cu radiator upstream of a 15  cm long liquid hydrogen target ) .",
    "it was observed in the test runs that the counting rate in the calorimeter fell rapidly as the threshold level was increased , which presented an opportunity to maintain a relatively low trigger rate even at high luminosity .",
    "however , on - line use of the calorimeter signal required a set of summing electronics and careful equalizing and monitoring of the individual channel outputs during the experiment .",
    "as the rcs experiment represented the first use of such a calorimeter at very high luminosity , a detailed study of the calorimeter performance throughout the course of the experiment has been conducted .",
    "this includes a study of the relationship between luminosity , trigger rate , energy resolution and adc pedestal widths . an observed fall - off in energy resolution as the experiment progressed allowed for characterization of radiation damage sustained by the lead - glass blocks .",
    "it was possible to mitigate this radiation damage after the experiment by annealing , with both uv curing and heating proving effective .",
    "we begin by discussing the various components which make up the calorimeter and the methods used in their construction .",
    "this is followed by a description of veto hodoscopes which were used for particle identification purposes .",
    "an overview of the high - voltage and data acquisition systems is then presented , followed , finally , by a discussion on the performance of the calorimeter in the unique high - luminosity environment during the rcs experiment .",
    "the concepts and technology associated with a fine - granularity lead - glass erenkov electromagnetic calorimeter ( gams ) were developed by yu .",
    "prokoshkin and collaborators at the institute of high energy physics ( ihep ) in serpukhov , russia @xcite .",
    "the gams type concept has since been employed for detection of high - energy electrons and photons in several experiments at jlab , ihep , cern , fnal and desy ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "many of the design features of the calorimeter presented in this article are similar to those of serpukhov . a schematic showing",
    "the overall design of the rcs calorimeter can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : side - view ] .",
    "the main components are :    * the lead - glass blocks ; * a light - tight box containing the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) ; * a gain - monitoring system ; * a doubly - segmented veto hodoscopes ; * the front - end electronics ; * an elevated platform ; * a lifting frame .",
    "the calorimeter frame hosts a matrix of 22@xmath432 lead - glass blocks together with their associated pmts and high voltage ( hv ) dividers . immediately in front of the lead - glass blocks is a sheet of ultraviolet - transmitting ( uvt ) lucite , which is used to distribute calibration light pulses for gain - monitoring purposes uniformly among all 704 blocks .",
    "the light - tight box provides protection of the pmts from ambient light and contains an air - cooling system as well as the hv and signal cable systems .",
    "two veto hodoscopes , operating as erenkov counters with uvt lucite as a radiator , are located in front of the calorimeter .",
    "the front - end electronics located a few feet behind the detector were assembled in three relay racks .",
    "they are comprised of 38 analog summers , trigger logic and patch panels .",
    "the elevated platform was needed to bring the calorimeter to the level of the beam line , while the lifting frame was used to re - position the calorimeter in the experimental hall by means of an overhead crane .",
    "this procedure , which took on average around two hours , was performed more than 25 times during the course of the experiment .",
    "[ ht ]          the main frame of the calorimeter is made of 10 inch wide steel c - channels .",
    "a thick flat aluminum plate was bolted to the bottom of the frame , with a second plate installed vertically and aligned to 90@xmath5 with respect to the first one by means of alignment screws ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : front ] ) .",
    "another set of screws , mounted inside and at the top of the main frame on the opposite side of the vertical alignment plate , was used to compress all gaps between the lead - glass modules and to fix their positions .",
    "the load was applied to the lead - glass blocks through 1  inch  @xmath4  1  inch  @xmath6  0.5  inch plastic plates and a 0.125 inch rubber pad . in order to further assist block alignment , 1 inch wide stainless steel strips of 0.004 inch thickness running from top to bottom of the frame",
    "were inserted between every two columns of the lead - glass modules .",
    "all pmts and hv dividers are located inside a light - tight box , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] . as the current on each hv divider is 1  ma , simultaneous operation of all pmts would , without cooling , lead to a temperature rise inside the box of around 50 - 70@xmath5c .",
    "an air - cooling system was developed to prevent the pmts from overheating , and to aid the stable operation of the calorimeter .",
    "the air supply was provided by two parallel oil - less regenerative blowers of r4110 - 2 type , which are capable of supplying air at a maximum pressure of 52 inches water and a maximum flow of 92  cfm .",
    "the air is directed toward the hv divider via vertical collector tubes and numerous outlets .",
    "when the value on any one of the temperature sensors installed in several positions inside the box exceeds a preset limit , the hv on the pmts is turned off by an interlock system .",
    "the air line is equipped with a flow switch of type fst-321-spdt which was included in the interlock system .",
    "the average temperature inside the box during the entire experimental run did not exceed the preset limit of 55@xmath7c .",
    "a simple and reliable cabling system is one of the key features of multichannel detectors , with easy access to the pmts and hv dividers for installation and repair being one of the key features .",
    "the cabling system includes :    * 1 foot long hv and signal pig - tails soldered to the hv divider ; * patch panels for lemo and hv connectors ; * 10 feet long cables from those patch panels to the front - end electronics and the hv distribution boxes ; * the hv distribution boxes themselves ; * bnc - bnc patch panels for the outputs of the front - end modules ; * bnc - bnc patch panels on the daq side for the analog signals ; * bnc - lemo patch panels on the daq side for the veto - counter lines .",
    "figure [ fig : cabling ] shows the cabling arrangement inside the pmt box .",
    "the patch panels , which are custom - built and mounted on the air supply tubes , have the ability to swing to the side in order to allow access to the pmts and the hv dividers .",
    "the box has two moving doors , the opening of which leads to activation of an interlock system connected to the hv supply .        in order to reduce the diameter of the cable bundle from the pmt box , rg-174 cable ( diameter 0.1 inch )",
    "was used for the pmt signals , and a twisted pair for the hv connection ( two individually insulated inner 26 awg conductors with an overall flame - retardant pvc jacket , part number 001 - 21803 from the general wire product company ) .",
    "the box patch panels used for the hv lines each convert 24 of the above twisted pairs ( single hv line ) to the multi - wire hv cables ( the part 001 - 21798 made by general wire product ) , which run to the hv power supply units located in the shielded area near daq racks .",
    "the basic components of the segmented calorimeter are the tf-1 lead - glass blocks and the feu 84 - 3 pmts . in the 1980s the yerevan physics institute ( yerphi ) purchased a consignment of tf-1 lead - glass blocks of 4  cm  @xmath84  cm@xmath640  cm and feu  84 - 3 pmts of 34  mm diameter ( with an active photo - cathode diameter of 25  mm ) for the construction of a calorimeter to be used in several experiments at the yerphi synchrotron . in january of",
    "1998 the rcs experiment at jlab was approved and soon after these calorimeter components were shipped from yerevan to jlab .",
    "this represented the yerphi contribution to the experiment , as the properties of the tf-1 lead - glass met the requirements of the experiment in terms of photon / electron detection with reasonable energy and position resolution and radiation hardness .",
    "the properties of tf-1 lead - glass @xcite are given in table [ tab : tf1 ] .",
    ".important properties of tf-1 lead - glass . [",
    "cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : resolution ]    at high luminosity the energy resolution degrades due to fluctuations of the base line ( pedestal width ) and the inclusion of more accidental hits during the adc gate period .",
    "however , for the 9-block cluster size used in the data analysis the contribution of the base line fluctuations to the energy resolution is just 1 - 2% .",
    "the measured widths of adc pedestals confirmed the results of monte carlo simulations and test runs that the radiation background is three times higher with the 6% cu radiator upstream of the target than without it .",
    "the resolution obtained from e - p calibration runs was corrected for the drift of the gains so it could be attributed directly to the effect of lead glass radiation damage .",
    "it degraded over the course of the experiment from 5.5% ( for a 1  gev photon energy ) at the start to larger than 10% by the end .",
    "it was estimated that this corresponds to a final accumulated radiation dose of about 3 - 10  krad , which is in agreement with the known level of radiation hardness of the tf-1 lead glass @xcite .",
    "this observed radiation dose corresponds to a 500 hour experiment with a 15  cm lh2 target and 50  @xmath3a beam .",
    "the front face of the calorimeter during the experiment was protected by plastic material with an effective thickness of 10  g/@xmath2 . for the majority of the time",
    "the calorimeter was located at a distance of 5 - 8  m and an angle of 40 - 50@xmath5 with respect to the electron beam direction .",
    "the transparency of 20 lead - glass blocks was measured after the experiment , the results of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad_glass ] .",
    "this plot shows the relative transmission through 4  cm of glass in the direction transverse to the block length at different locations .",
    "the values were normalized to the transmission through similar lead - glass blocks which were not used in the experiment .",
    "the transmission measurement was done with a blue led ( @xmath10 of 430  nm ) and a hamamatsu photo - diode ( 1226 - 44 ) .",
    "a uv technique was developed and used in order to cure radiation damage .",
    "the uv light was produced by a 10  kw total power 55-inch long lamp , which was installed vertically at a distance of 45 inches from the calorimeter face and a quartz plate ( c55quartz ) was used as an infrared filter .",
    "the intensity of the uv light at the face of the lead - glass blocks was found to be 75 mw/@xmath2 by using a uvx digital radiometer . in situ",
    "uv irradiation without disassembly of the lead - glass stack was performed over an 18 hour period .",
    "all pmts were removed before irradiation to ensure the safety of the photo - cathode .",
    "the resultant improvement in transparency can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad_glass ] . an alternative but equally effective method to restore the lead - glass transparency , which involved heating of the lead - glass blocks to 250@xmath5c for several hours , was also tested .",
    "the net effect of heating on the transparency of the lead - glass was similar to the uv curing results .    in summary , operation of the calorimeter at high luminosity , particularly when the electron beam was incident on the bremsstrahlung radiator , led to a degradation in energy resolution due to fluctuations in the base - line and a higher accidental rate within the adc gate period .",
    "for typical clusters this effect was found to be around a percent or two . by far",
    "the largest contributor to the observed degradation in resolution was radiation damage sustained by the lead - glass blocks , which led to the resolution being a factor of two larger at the end of the experiment .",
    "the resulting estimates of the total accumulated dose were consistent with expectations for this type of lead - glass .",
    "finally , it was found that both uv curing and heating of the lead - glass were successful in annealing this damage .",
    "the design of a segmented electromagnetic calorimeter which was used in the jlab rcs experiment has been described . the performance of the calorimeter in an unprecedented high luminosity , high background environment has been discussed .",
    "good energy and position resolution enabled a successful measurement of the rcs process over a wide range of kinematics .",
    "we acknowledge the rcs collaborators who helped to operate the detector and the jlab technical staff for providing outstanding support , and specially d.  hayes , t.  hartlove , t.  hunyady , and s.  mayilyan for help in the construction of the lead - glass modules .",
