    "ego - centric social networks ( ego - networks ) map the interactions that occur between the social contacts of individual people . because they provide the view of the social world from a personal perspective , these structures are fundamental information blocks to understand how individual behaviour is linked to group life and societal dynamics . despite the growing availability of interaction data from online social media ,",

    ", people expand their social circles also as a result of automatic recommendations that are offered to them , which makes it harder to disentangle spontaneous user behavior from algorithmically - induced actions .",
    "we aim to provide an all - round description about how ego - networks are formed and how automated contact recommendations might bias their growth .",
    "we do so by analyzing the full longitudinal traces of 170 m ego - networks from flickr and tumblr ( @xmath0[sec : dataset ] ) , answering several open research questions about the shape of their boundaries , their community structure , and the process of neighbor selection in time ( @xmath0[sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "the richness of the data we study allows for the identification of those tumblr links that have been created as a result of recommendations served by the platform , which positions us in an unique standpoint to investigate the impact of link recommender systems on the process of network growth .",
    "some of our key findings are :    * the backbone of a typical ego - network is shaped within the initial month of a node s activity and within the first @xmath150 - 100 links created . in that period",
    ", new contacts are added in larger batches and the main communities emerge . unlike global social networks , whose diameter shrinks in time , the average distance between nodes in ego - networks expands rapidly and then stabilizes . *",
    "the selection criteria of new neighbors change as new contacts are added , with popular contacts being more frequently followed in earlier stages of the ego s life , and friends - of - friends being selected in later stages .",
    "the neighbor selection is also heavily driven by the ego - network s community structure , as people tend to grow different sub - groups sequentially , with an in - depth exploration strategy . *",
    "the link recommender system skews the process of ego - network construction towards more popular contacts but at the same time restraining the growth of its diameter , compared to spontaneous behavior . with a matching experiment aimed at detecting causal relationships from observational data , we find that the bias introduced by the recommendations fosters diversity : people exposed to recommendations end up creating pools of contacts that are more different from each other compared to those who were not exposed .",
    "the outcomes of our analysis have theoretical implications in network science and find direct application in link recommendation and prediction tasks .",
    "we run a prediction experiment ( @xmath0[sec : prediction ] ) to show that simple temporal signals could be crucial features to improve link prediction performance , as the criteria of ego - network expansion vary as the ego grows older . in a second experiment ,",
    "we test the algorithmic capability to tell apart spontaneous links from recommendation - induced ones .",

    "for all the links created after january 2015 , we can reliably estimate if they have been created as an effect of a recommendation .",
    "this information is inferred by combining the log of recommendation impressions ( i.e. , when recommendations are visualized by the user ) with the log of link creations . when the link is created shortly after the recommendation is displayed , we count the link creation as triggered by a recommendation .    , @xmath5 ) and flickr ( @xmath6 , @xmath7).,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath5 ) and flickr ( @xmath6 , @xmath7).,title=\"fig : \" ]      flickr is a popular photo - sharing platform in which users can upload a large amount ( up to 1 tb ) of pictures and share them with friends .",

    "figure  [ fig : timelines ] plots the number of links created over the course of the platforms life .",
    "both networks have experienced a noticeable growth .",
    "for tumblr , we can plot the time series of recommended link creations occurred after january 2015 .",
    "we also calculate the set of links that close at least one triangle . in tumblr ,",
    "the first sharp increase in the number of triangle - closing links is found between 2012 and 2013 . that is determined by the introduction of a new link recommender system .",

    "the growth of social networks is associated with three changes in their macroscopic structure : densification , diameter shrinking , and inclusion of almost all nodes in a single giant connected component  @xcite .",

    "more surprisingly , densification does not always lead to the emergence of a single giant connected component covering the whole graph . on average ,",
    "the largest component s size relative to the network size grows as new nodes join ( figure  [ fig : components ] , left ) , but it stabilizes around @xmath32 for networks of 200 nodes or more .",
    "the number of components grows sublinearly with the number of nodes ( not shown ) .",
    "more notably , the diameter shows little signs of shrinking . the _ network distance _ , computed as the average distance between all pairs of nodes , experiences a three - phases evolution ( figure  [ fig : density_diameter ] , right ) .",
    "first , at the beginning of the ego - network life , it expands rapidly ( _ exploration _ ) ; then , it starts shrinking slightly ( _ consolidation _ ) before asintotically converging to a stable value ( _ stabilization _ ) .",
    "this trend is very different from the sharp diameter decline that characterizes social graphs .",
    "we speculate that the consolidation phase might be connected with the intrinsic human limitation to maintain large social groups , as theorized by robin dunbar  @xcite .",
    "when the ego s social neighborhood exceeds the size that is cognitively manageable by a person ( roughly , 150 to 200 individuals ) , a compensation effect might be triggered : new contacts are not anymore sought further away from the social circles that have been already established , putting an end to the exploration phase .",
    "this happens at @xmath33 in flickr and @xmath34 in tumblr , values that are compatible with dunbar s theory .",

    "new recommended contacts tend to be closer to existing ego - network members . at fixed network size , the addition of new recommended nodes increases the network distance @xmath35 less , on average , than a spontaneous node addition .",
    "ego - networks with at least a recommended node have smaller network distance than ego - networks that grew fully spontaneously ; this difference varies with the size , being only @xmath36 smaller for networks under 50 nodes up to @xmath37 smaller for networks with 200 nodes or more .",
    "also , spontaneous nodes have far higher chances , compared to recommended ones , to spawn a new component disconnected from the rest of the ego - network ( figure  [ fig : components ] , right ) .",
    "* accounting for amalgamation effects .",
    "* to explore evolutionary trends of ego - networks , we rely on aggregate analysis : an indicator is measured on an ego - network when its @xmath25 node is added and then it is averaged across all ego - networks .",
    "trends are discovered as @xmath26 grows ( e.g. , diameter in figure  [ fig : density_diameter ] , right ) .",
    "this approach may yield misleading results because averages computed at different values of @xmath26 are obtained from different sample sets .",
    "this problem is known as the _ simpson s paradox _",
    "@xcite and it is usually addressed by fixing the sample set  @xcite . to account for it , every time we perform an evolutionary analysis as @xmath26 varies in @xmath38 $ ] , we compare results obtained in two settings : the first using the full dataset and the latter considering only the subset of ego - networks that reached at least size @xmath39 .",
    "the results are only slightly different across the two settings , for all the indicators analyzed . for the sake of brevity , we report just one example of such comparison . in figure",
    "[ fig : density_diameter ] right , the diameter evolution for tumblr ego - networks that reached at least size 1000 is very similar to the trend found when all ego - networks are considered .",
    "the process of link creation in online social networks is driven by two main factors : popularity ( that leads to preferential attachment  @xcite ) and similarity ( that leads to homophily  @xcite ) . at network scale , their relative weight in predicting the creation of new links might vary depending on the type of social network  @xcite . at microscopic scale ,",

    "drawing the distributions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( figure  [ fig : predictors_distr ] ) , we observe that the range of values is very broad in both platforms .",
    "the @xmath45 distributions suffer from cut - offs ( around @xmath46 ) caused by the scarcity of nodes with hundreds of common neighbors or more .",

    "a standard practice to assess those conditions is to measure the decay of the probability density functions for @xmath49 and @xmath48 : power law decays in the form @xmath52 indicate burstiness  @xcite .",

    "matching is a statistical technique that is used to evaluate the effect of a treatment on a dependent variable by comparing individuals who have received the treatment with others with similar observable features who did not receive it .",
    "the more similar the paired individuals and the higher the number of pairs , the higher the confidence of estimating the cause of the treatment on the dependent variable .     for groups sharing a matching sequence of length @xmath75 .",
    "95% confidence intervals are shown . ]",
    "we conduct a matching experiment to measure if people who follow recommendations end up having ego - networks more similar to one another than if they were to ignore recommendations .",
    "we arrange people in _ matching groups _ containing users who are nearly identical in terms of their local connectivity .",
    "we assign to the same matching group users who @xmath50 registered to tumblr less than 30 days apart , and @xmath51 whose very first @xmath75 neighbors are the same and have been added in the same order to their ego - networks .",
    "each matching group is then split in two subgroups : a _ treatment _ group of users whose @xmath77 contact is a recommended one , and a _ control _ group of all the remaining users , whose @xmath77 contact has been created spontaneously .",
    "the variety of contacts created at step @xmath78 is our dependent variable .",
    "if the variety measured in one group is significantly different from the other , we can attribute the divergence to the effect of the recommendation , as the initial conditions of the two groups are virtually identical .",
    "for example , if we found that the variety of nodes in the treatment group is lower than the one measured on the control group , we would conclude that recommendations conform the process of link creation by inducing users to follow a more restricted set of accounts compared to what would happen by spontaneous user behavior .",
    "we measure diversity of contacts through their entropy . to ensure a fair comparison that accounts for size heterogeneity , we use normalized entropy @xmath79 . given a bag of nodes @xmath80 of size @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of occurrences of node @xmath83 divided by @xmath81 , the normalized entropy is defined as : @xmath84.\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig : matching ] shows the results for a total of approximately @xmath85 matching groups , for @xmath86 $ ] ; requiring @xmath75 identical links is a too strong requirement for larger @xmath75 .",
    "every point is the average of all the matching groups for a given @xmath75 .",
    "first , we observe that , the higher the @xmath75 , the lower the entropy . that is expected : the higher the number of common neighbors , the more likely the next selected neighbor will be the same .",
    "last , most importantly , the variety of the treatment group is always higher ; this indicates that recommendations foster diversity .",
    "although it is difficult to pin down the exact reasons why this happens , we provide a possible interpretation . even if the list of recommended contacts was the same for all the users in the treatment group , the reshuffling of the top recommended contacts that tumblr implements in the link recommender widget introduces asymmetries across users .",
    "more generally , we could hypothesize that the recommender system exposes users to a wider set of potential contacts than the ones they would be exposed to by browsing or searching on the site , thus providing a wider spectrum of options and , in turn , a more diverse set of individual choices .    to test the robustness of the results , we explored some possible alternatives in the setup of the matching experiment .",
    "specifically we : @xmath50 measured the entropy at @xmath87 instead of @xmath78 ( we leave the @xmath88 generalization for future work ) ; @xmath51 selected only control and treatment groups with at least @xmath89 $ ] members ( the results reported are for @xmath90 ) ; @xmath91 randomly downsampled the larger group to match the size of the smaller one , to balance the size of the two ; @xmath92 run two independent experiments including in the treatment group only users whose recommended contact had 1 ) at least one common neighbor ( i.e. , the recommendation is provided based on network topology features ) or 2 ) no common neighbors ( i.e. , the recommendation is provided on a topical basis ) .",
    "the absolute values vary slightly across setups , but the qualitative results remain the same .",
    "our analytical results have direct implications on how link recommender systems can be enhanced to provide more effective suggestions .",
    "next , we discuss two prediction experiments that aim to answer two research questions .",
    "* q6 : to what extent temporal features improve the ability to predict new links ?",
    "*    the previous analysis showed that egos add new neighbors to their network with criteria that change in time .",
    "the resulting hypothesis is that link recommendations that adapt to the current evolutionary stage of the ego - network could gain effectiveness . to test such hypothesis",
    ", we run a prediction experiment .",
    "we consider a snapshot of the tumblr social network at an arbitrary time @xmath22 ( january @xmath93 2015 ) . to build a training set",
    ", we sample @xmath94 node pairs @xmath95 that are not directly connected but with at least one directed common neighbor ( i.e. , there is a directed path of length 2 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "half of the pairs will be directly connected by a link from @xmath13 to @xmath14 before @xmath76 ( positive examples ) , the remaining half will remain disconnected ( negative examples ) . for every pair ,",
    "we extract six simple features : @xmath13 s outdegree ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath14 s indegree ( @xmath97 ) , preferential attachment ( pa  @xmath98 ) , common neighbors ( cn  @xmath99 ) , jaccard similarity between neighbor sets ( jaccard = @xmath100 ) , and @xmath13 s age measured in number of days elapsed from @xmath13 s profile creation to @xmath22 . age and @xmath13 s outdegree are the two temporal features whose effectiveness we want to investigate : one measures time on a continuous scale , the other on the discrete scale of link creation events .",
    "the simple features above can predict the node pair class very accurately , and a summary of this evaluation ( 10-fold cross validation using random forest ) is given in table [ tab : prediction ] .",
    "the model trained on the full set of features yields an auc of 0.943 and a f - measure of 0.87 , which is an improvement of @xmath101/@xmath102 in terms of auc / f - measure over a baseline model that does not consider temporal features . adding the feature @xmath103 to the baseline model yields only a slight improvement in accuracy ( @xmath104/@xmath105 ) , while considering age improves the accuracy in a more consistent way ( @xmath106/@xmath107 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : featureimportance ] summarizes the importance of the features in this link prediction setting by measuring the _ mean decrease gini _ , the average gain of purity achieved when splitting on a given variable ( the higher , the better )  @xcite . in line with previous work  @xcite , this analysis further confirms the importance of the temporal features and found that time matters when recommending new contacts .",
    "* q7 : is it possible to limit the bias of the recommender system while keeping its high accuracy ?",

    ", we analyze the distribution of all structural features over a sample ( @xmath55k ) of recommended and spontaneous links , equally represented . for sake of presentation , we normalize the value of each feature on a scale 0 to 1 , by dividing the raw feature value by its maximum value in the whole @xmath55k sample . as shown in figure  [ fig : feature_analysis ] , spontaneous links tend to exhibit less degree of structural overlap than recommended links ( the median jaccard value on recommended links is @xmath110 times larger than the value recorded on spontaneous ones ) .",
    "the same observation holds when analyzing the node popularity ; the median in - degree of the target node on recommended links is one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding value computed on spontaneous links .",
    "learning to what extent it is possible to automatically tell recommended links and spontaneous links apart would allow us to train new recommender systems to suggest links whose properties better adhere to the natural criteria that people follow when adding new contacts . to gauge this possibility , we run a second prediction experiment with the same features and setup of the previous one but with a different selection of positive and negative examples .",
    "we pick @xmath111 pairs that will be connected in the future through a spontaneous link as positive examples , and as many pairs that will be connected through a recommended link as negative examples .",
    "a random forest classifier is able to distinguish the two classes pretty accurately ( auc  @xmath112 , f - measure  @xmath113 ) .    in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the recommender should learn to recognize the space between recommended links and truly negative examples ( links that are never formed ) . to model that",

    "this setting achieves a better performance ( auc  @xmath114 , f - measure  @xmath115 ) with around @xmath116 accuracy on the negative class and @xmath117 on the positive one . in short , even if very basic structural and temporal features are used , it is possible to effectively use the output of current link recommenders to train new recommenders that smooth the algorithmic bias and produce suggestions that better simulate the spontaneous process of link selection .",

    "we also find evidence that link recommendations foster network diversity by leading nodes that are structurally similar to choose different sets of new neighbors .",
    "our work has some limitations .",
    "flickr and tumblr are mainly interest networks , where people follow each other based on topical tastes",

    "also , we only consider the network structure and disregard any notion of node profile , including posting activity in time and user - generated content ; that information would help to further detail the dynamics of ego - network expansion with respect to other dimensions such as topical similarity between profiles .",
    "our results have a number of practical implications .",
    "we provide further evidence that in online social networks not all links are created equal ; network analysts who produce network growth models based on the observation of online social networks longitudinal traces should consider weighting links that emerge spontaneously different from those that are created algorithmically . through our prediction experiments , we also provide a hint about how link recommender systems could incorporate signals on the ego - network s evolutionary stage to improve the quality of suggestions .",
