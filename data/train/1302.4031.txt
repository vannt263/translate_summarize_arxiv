    "there has been a growing interest in the behavior of entanglement entropy ( ee ) @xcite in different physical fields . in condensed mater ,",
    "much of the interest stems from the behavior of the ground state ee in the presence of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite .",
    "the ee of a finite region a of a one - dimensional system grows logarithmically as long as the region s size @xmath0 is smaller than the correlation length @xmath1 characterizing the system , while it saturates for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this behavior may be used in order to extract @xmath1 , for example the ground state localization length of the anderson transition @xcite .",
    "a natural question is what is the behavior of the ee for the excited states @xcite ? beyond the growing interest in ee coming from the quantum information circles , the question whether ee is a useful concept in studying",
    "the behavior of excited states , is relevant to the condensed matter community .",
    "low lying excited states in the vicinity of a ground state quantum critical point ( qcp ) should be strongly influenced by the critical point @xcite , and one expects it to show in the behavior of the ee of these states .",
    "moreover , the whole concept of the many - body localization transition @xcite is centered on the behavior of the excited states .",
    "the localization - delocalization transition occurring at a critical excitation energy should change the properties of excitations above it which should be manifested in the properties of the excited states .",
    "although much effort went into trying to understand the transition using different properties of the excited states ( such as level statistics , inverse participation ratio , conductance , and correlations ) @xcite , all these studies were performed for rather small systems , and many questions remain open . recently",
    "@xcite , time evolution of the entanglement of an initial state was studied , and it showed signs of many - particle delocalization .",
    "thus , ee seems as a useful tool to study the many - body localization transition .    unlike the ground state ee for which universal results exist ,",
    "the understanding of ee for the excited states is still a work in progress @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to consider a system for which the ee of the excited states is simple enough to describe analytically , although it exhibits interesting behavior such as interaction induced delocalization of the excited states . in this paper",
    "we study the ee for such a system , namely two particles on a ring .",
    "the study of two interacting particle ( tip ) in a disordered one dimensional system has a long history in the context of many particle delocalization problem .",
    "all single - electron states for any amount of disorder are localized @xcite .",
    "this continues to be true for two - electron states , however , the localization length becomes longer as the repulsive interaction becomes stronger @xcite .",
    "this interaction induced delocalization was confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that there is no enhancement of the localization length in the ground state .",
    "the delocalization becomes significant only for higher excitations .",

    "this ee is related to the region s reduced density matrix @xmath22 , defined in the following way : @xmath23 where the trace is over region s b or a degrees of freedom .",
    "the ee is related to the eigenvalues @xmath24 of the reduced density matrix : @xmath25 one important result of this definition is the symmetry between the ee of the two regions @xmath26 .    following cheong and henley @xcite",

    "as expected , the ee for any single particle eigenstate @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 and does not depend on @xmath58 .",
    "a note of caution is in place",

    "as long as the degeneracy is broken the ee of any excited state @xmath63 is well defined and does not depend on @xmath9 .    for two - particle states",

    "all the values of the ee for any value of @xmath74 fall in between those two limits , but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : clean ] they quite quickly fall on the @xmath91 curve . since there is a large phase space for @xmath91 , a typical two particle excitation corresponds to the ee described in eq .",
    "[ ee_large_k ] .    another interesting behavior that can be gleaned from fig .",
    "[ fig : clean ] is that all two - particle states of even @xmath74 reach the same ee value at @xmath92 .",
    "this stems from the structure of @xmath51 ( eq . ( [ rho_1 ] ) ) , where the two last terms are multiplied by @xmath93 ( since @xmath94 ) returning to the density matrix block with a toeplitz form depicted in eq .",
    "( [ rho_1_large ] ) , and the corresponding two degenerate eigenvalues equal to @xmath95 . since at @xmath92 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ,",
    "the two other block eigenvalues are also @xmath95 , resulting in @xmath98 .",
    "thus the largest ee in a two - particle clean ring system is equal to @xmath99 .",
    "incorporating nearest neighbor electron - electron interactions into the system , results in adding an interaction term given by @xmath100 to the hamiltonian , @xmath101 , depicted in eq .",
    "( [ clean_hamiltonian ] ) . in a clean system",
    "it is well known that far from half - filling the system behaves as a luttinger liquid for any value of @xmath102 @xcite . for the ground state ee of a clean system at half - filling ( and @xmath103 ,",
    "i.e. , a luttinger liquid ) the ee changes only by an overall constant @xcite , while retaining the same logarithmic dependence .",
    "thus , we expect that the ee of the two - particle states in a clean system will not be essentially affected by the presence or absence of electron - electron interactions .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to calculate analytically the two - particle states of the interacting system .",
    "thus , we must rely on a numerical solution for the problem .",
    "exact diagonalization is used to calculate all the eigevectors of @xmath104 , represented by a @xmath105 matrix .",
    "we have chosen a @xmath106 site system , resulting in a matrix of size @xmath107 .",
    "a reduced density matrix @xmath108 , of size @xmath109 is then constructed and diagonalized for each eigenstate , and the ee is calculated using its eigenvectors according to eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] , where the ee of @xmath110 states around the ground state ( i.e. the ground state and 1st - 30th excitation ) , and at quarter of the two - particle band ( 1222th - 1252st excitation ) are shown . in both cases",
    "the ee for the non - interacting ( @xmath111 ) as well as for the interacting ( @xmath112 ) cases are almost equal ( the interacting case is larger by a minute constant ( of order @xmath113 which can not be resolved at the resolution of the figure ) .",
    "as expected around the ground - state the excitations belong to the low @xmath74 sector while for the higher excitations most states corresponds to large values of @xmath74 , i.e. , well described by eq .",
    "( [ ee_large_k ] ) .",
    "when disorder is added to a non - interacting system , all single particle states become localized . for the many - particle states ,",
    "the behavior is more involved .",
    "as long as no interaction is present , the many - particle states remain localized , both for the ground state @xcite as well as for all the excited states .",
    "once interaction is introduced , the ground - state as well as low lying excitations remain localized , while above a critical energy the many - particle excitations are predicted to delocalize @xcite .",
    "this transition , termed the many - body or fock space localization transition , stems from the interactions coupling excitations with a different number of electron - hole couples .",
    "this type of transition is irrelevant for two particle systems .",
    "nevertheless , as argued by shepelynsky and imry @xcite , interaction between the pair of particles should enhance the two particle localization length , compared to the single electron localization length , as long as the two - particle level spacing is significantly smaller than the single electron level spacing , i.e. , for higher excitations .",
    "can we see any signature of the enhanced two - particle localization length in the ee behavior of the excited states ?",
    "first we have to understand the influence of disorder on the ee . in ref .",
    "it has been shown that for the ground - state the ee saturates on the length scale of @xmath1 , and does not continue to grow logarithmic as in a clean system .",
    "thus , the ee of a disordered system is always lower than the ee of a clean system .",
    "one would expect this feature to hold also for excited states .",
    "we check this assumption by calculating the ee using the excitations of the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ clean_hamiltonian ] ) , where the disorder is represented by a random on - site energy , @xmath114 taken from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath115 $ ] . for @xmath116 , single electron states at the middle of the band",
    "are expected to have a localization length @xmath117 @xcite , while close to the band edge the single electron states are supposed to be much more strongly localized ( lifshitz tails ) @xcite .",
    "the ee is calculated by exact diagonalization for systems of size @xmath118 as described in the previous section .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_strong ] , where the median ee in the vicinity of the ground - state ( 1st - 30th excitation ) , at @xmath119 of the band ( 294th - 324th excitation ) , at @xmath120 of the band ( 603th - 633th excitation ) , and at @xmath95 of the band ( 1222th - 1252th excitation ) .",
    "the median ee is taken across the 31 excitations in each segment and 50 different realizations of disorder .",
    "we calculate the ee in the absence ( @xmath111 ) and presence ( @xmath112 , @xmath121 ) of electron - electron interactions . around the ground state",
    ", the interactions do not play a significant role , and for all cases the ee is strongly suppressed compared to typical values for a clean system .",
    "this is expected , since as mentioned , at the bottom of the band the states are strongly localized , and therefore the ee is low .    for the non - interacting case , the ee higher in the band",
    "are less suppressed as the localization length grows .",
    "the ee for high excitations in the interacting case is always larger than for the corresponding non - interacting states .",
    "this is a clear signature for the effect of interactions on localization of the two - particle states , which become more entangled as interaction is present , although there is no significant difference between @xmath112 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is also clear that for higher excitations ( larger localization length ) the enhancement of the ee becomes stronger .",
    "this enhancement could be expected on physical grounds . as has been shown @xcite ,",
    "the localization length associated with an interacting two - particle state is larger than for a non - interacting state with the same disorder .",
    "thus , one expects that the ee will also be larger and closer to its clean system value .",
    "we therefore also investigate the case of weaker disorder , for which the localization length is of order of the system size ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_weak ] , for the non - interacting case a similar pattern to the one observed fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_strong ] remains , although the ee is less suppressed by the weaker disorder .",
    "as expected , the enhancement of the ee by interactions is stronger for the weaker disorder .",
    "surprisingly , above @xmath120 of the band ( corresponding to an excitation energy of @xmath124 ) , the ee of the disordered interacting system is significantly larger than the limit for a clean system ( @xmath99 ) . although , extrapolating from the results presented in fig . [",
    "fig : dis_strong ] , increasing the system size while keeping the disorder fixed will result in a decrease of the ee below the clean system values once @xmath125 . the increase above the clean system excitation ee may stem from the fact that as long as the two particles are confined within a single localization length the particles can not avoid each other and spend much time close to each other , leading to an enhancement of the ee .",
    "when the system size is much larger than the localization length , the two particles can reside in different regions of the sample , and interactions will not play an important role .",
    "however , this hand waving picture requires further study .    at first glance , these results seem to indicate that although interactions may enhance the ee as long as @xmath126 , they become irrelevant for @xmath125 , showing no support for the many - particle delocalization scenario @xcite which should occur for @xmath125 .",
    "this interpretation is wrong , since the many - particle delocalization scenario deals with a constant density of particles , and delocalization is predicted only when there are at least a couple of particles in the range of a single particle localization length .",
    "thus the observed two - particle ee enhancement when the two particles are within a distance of @xmath1 , as well as the fact that the enhancement increases significantly when the excitation energy , fits nicely with the scenario promoted in ref .",
    "of course , coupling between states with a different number of electron - hole generation is crucial for the delocalization scenario , and therefore a full demonstration of the delocalization transition has to be performed for a finite electron density system .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the two - particle behavior fits nicely with the delocalization scenario is encouraging .",
    "the properties of the ee of two particle excited states in a one - dimensional ring were studied . for a clean system , the ee depends only on the difference in momentum between the two particles .",
    "if the difference is large the ee corresponds to the ee of two independent single particle states , i.e. , @xmath127 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if the momenta are close , the ee of the two particle state is reduced compared to this value .",
    "one may extrapolate that for @xmath128 particles on a @xmath3 site ring , as long as the density is low ( @xmath129 ) , the upper limit of the ee is @xmath130 $ ] , which is also the typical value .",
    "this will be valid if the difference between the momenta of all particles taking part in a particular many - particle excited state is large . if this is not the case we expect the ee of the excited state to be lower .",
    "further investigation of these cases is underway .",
    "we have verified numerically that disorder reduces the ee .",
    "short range particle interaction leads to an enhancement of the excited state ee , which become very significant once the localization length is of order of the system size . for high excitations",
    "the median ee of a many particle interacting excitation is not only above the disordered case , but exceeds the clean system limit .",
    "this may be related to the fact that localization forces the two particles to dynamically spend more time in the vicinity of each other , although this argument merits further study .        for recent reviews",
