    "linard - wiechert fields , which represent the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge , consist of a part which is linear in the acceleration @xmath6 of a point charge , and a part which is independent of @xmath6 . the latter part , which is called `` velocity fields '' , decreases as @xmath7 with increasing distance @xmath8 from the charge , and is considered to be bound to the charge ( a generalized coulomb field ) . the former part , which is called `` acceleration fields '' , decreases as @xmath9 , and is considered to be emitted from the charge .    rohrlich  @xcite showed that one can define radiation at any distance from a charge without referring to the region of large @xmath8 ( wave zone ) , and this point of view was further developed by teitelboim .",
    "teitelboim  @xcite split the energy - momentum tensor of retarded fields into a part @xmath10 , which is related only to acceleration fields , and a part @xmath11 , which consists of the contribution of the pure velocity fields and the contribuiton of the interference between velocity fields and acceleration fields .",
    "he found that part @xmath10 propagates along the future light cone while its energy and momentum do not decrease .",
    "therefore , this part is regarded as the emitted part of the tensor at any distance from the charge , and one need not investigate the behavior of the field in the wave zone to identify the radiation .",
    "the definition of radiation given by rohrlich and teitelboim is appropriate in inertial frames ( see section 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and their definition concerns the detection of radiation by an observer who experiences inertial motion .",
    "however , one can consider the situation that an observer detects radiation while he experiences accelerated motion , and such consideration might help us investigate the definition of radiation in general curved spacetimes .",
    "for this reason , in this paper , we attempt to identify the emitted part and bound part of the elecromagnetic field generated by a point charge in the rindler frame , in the elctromagnetic flux generated by the charge , where @xmath12 is the radial coordinate of the advanced optical coordinates , which represents the distance between the observer and the charge . comparing our result with their result ( by applying eq .",

    "@xcite to the rindler frame ) , we find that our result is consistent with their result when the charge is instantaneously at rest in the rindler frame ( that is , in the case @xmath13 ) , but in more general situations , our result is not consistent with their result .",
    "details of the comparison of the two works are given in appendix [ comparison ] . ] which is interpreted as a uniformly accelerated frame in minkowski spacetime , and is regarded as an example of a curved spacetime ( a constant homogeneous gravitational field ) .",
    "we begin our discussion in a more general context than that restricted to the rindler frame . in minkowski spacetime",
    ", we consider the definition of radiation in an accelerated frame with a time - like killing vector field .",
    "( we call this frame `` the stationary frame '' for simplicity . ) in a stationary frame , one can define energy by invoking the invariance with respect to time translation generated by killing vector fields . by using this concept of energy ,",
    "we generalize the reasoning of teitelboim to stationary frames . to find the proper identification of the emitted part and bound part , we introduce the following three conditions as guiding principles .",
    "( 1 ) a charge fixed in the frame dose not radiate . ( 2 ) the energy of the emitted part propagates along the future light cone without damping . ( 3 ) the bound part does not contribute to the energy at the infinity from the charge ( see  [ kgeneral ] ) .",
    "next , we apply the result obtained in stationary frames to the rindler frame . by using the third condition mentioned above",
    ", one finds that only the emitted part contributes to the rindler energy in the region infinitely distant from the charge .",
    "then we evaluate the energy",
    "( of course , this is defined in the rindler frame ) of the total electromagnetic field in this region , and obtain the radiation power emitted per unit proper time of the charge @xmath0eq .",
    "( [ formula])@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we find that the result is proportional to the square of the acceleration @xmath14 $ ] relative to the rindler frame , where @xmath15 is a projector , @xmath16 and @xmath6 are the 4-velocity and 4-acceleration of the charge , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the 4-velocity and 4-acceleration of a rindler observer .",
    "this resembles the situation in inertial frames , where the larmor formula is proportional to the square of the acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "this result leads us to split the retarded fields into a part @xmath3 that is linear in @xmath2 and a part @xmath4 that is independent of @xmath2 , and this causes the splitting of the energy - momentum tensor of the field into the emitted part @xmath3 and bound part @xmath4 .",
    "we find that this splitting of the tensor satisfies our three conditions .    in our result ,",
    "a charge radiates neither in the case that the charge is fixed to the rindler frame , nor in the case that the trajectory of the charge satisfies the equation @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we solve this equation and investigate the properties of this trajectory .",
    "also we briefly investigate the action of the charge on the bound part @xmath4 in terms of the rindler energy .",
    "there is an old paradox of classical electrodynamics concerning whether a uniformly accelerated charge radiates  @xcite .",
    "we briefly interpret our result by applying it to four _ gedanken experiments _ related to this paradox .    after this section ,",
    "we proceed as follows . in   [ splitting ] , we generalize teitelboim s work to stationary frames , and by using this and the radiation formula in the rindler frame derived in appendices [ appendix ] and [ new ] , we identify the emitted part and the bound part in the rindler frame . in",
    "  [ motion ] , we solve the equation @xmath5 in the rindler frame , and investigate its physical and geometrical properties .",

    "[ comparison ] , our work is compared with the work of fugmann and kretzschmar . throughout the paper , we use gaussian units and the metric with signature @xmath19 .",
    "although the purpose of this paper is to determine the proper identification of the bound and emitted parts of the maxwell tensor in the rindler frame , it would be useful to proceed in as general a context as possible for the purpose of future generalization of the work .",
    "for this reason , we begin our discussion of the general case of accelerated frames that are generated by time - like killing vector fields .",
    "later , we restrict our attention to the special case of the rindler frame .      because we seek the proper identification of emitted parts in accelerated frames , it seems natural to evaluate the radiation power with respect to the energy defined in accelerated frames , not in inertial frames .",
    "we restrict our consideration to accelerated frames that are generated by time - like killing vector fields ( stationary frames ) , because in such frames one can introduce the concept of energy by invoking invariance with respect to time translations generated by the killing fields .",
