    "the experimental status of the exotic baryon @xmath3 is rather uncertain .",
    "various collaborations have given either positive results for its observation , or null results , casting doubts on the existence of the @xmath3 and on the correctness of the positive claims ( see recent experimental reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the apparently most impressive searches today are the recent clas collaboration publications  @xcite with null results for @xmath3-photoproduction in several final - state channels .",
    "nevertheless , investigations are continuing , and several new ( `` after - clas '' ) dedicated experiments have given both positive  @xcite and null  @xcite resutls .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that there are no data sets , from independent groups , with exactly overlapping conditions ( initial and/or final states , kinematical regions ) .",
    "therefore , when using any null result of one group to reject the positive result of another , we need to apply some theoretical models / assumptions . here",
    "we also encounter numerous uncertainties .",
    "for instance , current approaches to the theoretical description of @xmath8-production ( for example , its photoproduction off the nucleon  @xcite ) are mainly based on @xmath9 and @xmath0 meson or reggeon exchanges .",
    "the vertex for the @xmath10-coupling may be considered as known , if one assumes the spin - parity and width of @xmath3 to be known ( the corresponding form factor is still a problem , of course ) .",
    "contrary to this , properties of the @xmath0 exchange are totally unknown . however , they may be essential , _ e.g. _ , for comparisons of @xmath3-photoproduction off the proton and/or the neutron .    in the present note ,",
    "we obtain at least rough estimates of the @xmath11-coupling .",
    "similar estimates will be provided for @xmath0-vertices contributing to the excitation @xmath4 . to derive the present results",
    ", we relate these vertices to the radiative vertex , extracted recently  @xcite from preliminary experimental evidence on @xmath12 , obtained by the graal collaboration @xcite , with preliminary confirmation from the cb - elsa - taps  @xcite and lns  @xcite collaborations .",
    "let us consider transitions between two baryons @xmath13 through radiation of a photon or @xmath0 .",
    "as a first step , we may assume the flavor symmetry @xmath14 to be exact .",
    "then , the corresponding vertices for the vector meson octet are generated in qcd by the quark vector current @xmath15 .",
    "this is an octet in @xmath14 , and the superscript @xmath16 specifies its components .",
    "the @xmath0 meson , or any other member of the vector meson octet , is coupled to a particular combination of the components of the @xmath15 .",
    "the electromagnetic current is also related ( proportional ) to one of those components .",
    "since it is conserved , and the @xmath14 is assumed to be exact , all other components should be conserved as well . if both initial and final baryons have @xmath17 , then the transition vertex @xmath18 has the general form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the momentum transfer , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the corresponding baryons , and the form factors @xmath23 are invariant functions of @xmath24 . for a specific vector meson @xmath25",
    ", we obtain the corresponding vertex @xmath26 of the same structure , with coefficients @xmath27 which are specific combinations of @xmath28 .",
    "conservation of the current @xmath15 implies that @xmath29 in the present note , we are interested in transitions between baryons of different flavor multiplets and , hence , of different masses . for such transitions ,",
    "@xmath30 is proportional to @xmath24 and , thus , disappears at @xmath31 , in contrast to @xmath32 . for the case of exact @xmath14 , the last term of the vertex  ( [ eq : vert ] ) does not provide any non - vanishing physically meaningful contribution ( in total analogy with a similar term in the photon vertex )",
    "though the situation might change after accounting for the violation of @xmath33 , we advocate the tensor coupling ( _ i.e. _ , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vert ] ) ) to have the leading role at small @xmath24 for non - diagonal transitions . the relative contributions of other couplings should be suppressed . for the radiative decay @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) , with the real photon having @xmath36 , only the second term in the vertex is physically meaningful , and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the transition magnetic moment .",
    "the dominance of the tensor coupling over the vector one in hadronic non - diagonal transitions ( between different flavor multiplets ) is supported by the analysis  @xcite of data for transitions between @xmath39 and @xmath40 multiplets . for",
    "diagonal transitions @xmath41 , the conservation of the current @xmath15 does not require @xmath42 to vanish at @xmath43 , though the `` tensor dominance '' may still be true as well , at least for some components of the current .",
    "for example , experimental data compilation  @xcite suggests that for the vertex @xmath44 the ratio @xmath45 is large ( @xmath46 , the tensor - over - vector dominance is true ) , but for the vertices @xmath47 and @xmath48 it is small ( @xmath49 , the dominance is untrue ) .    regrettably , many phenomenological calculations of @xmath8-production ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) have used only the vector coupling for vector - meson exchanges , assuming a non - vanishing @xmath50 and neglecting @xmath51 . to our best knowledge ,",
    "dominance of the tensor coupling has been used only in refs .",
    "let us consider the tensor couplings for the transitions @xmath53 .",
    "an octet baryon can not be transformed into an antidecuplet member using a unitary singlet meson , while it can be done through coupling with a unitary octet meson .",
    "since the product @xmath54 contains @xmath55 only once , all the appearing coupling constants may be expressed through one of them .",
    "the corresponding relations may be found by means of the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the group @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "this method was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to find relations between coupling constants for transitions @xmath57 with radiation of the octet pseudoscalar mesons . for our case ( vector mesons )",
    ", these results would need some modification , because the vector mesons have an essential singlet - octet mixing , absent for the pseudoscalar mesons . instead",
    ", we will apply here another ( equivalent ) way which uses only the standard ( and more widely familiar ) @xmath58-formalism of the clebsch - gordan coefficients , with the corresponding phase conventions .",
    "our approach is based on the fact that the group @xmath14 has three @xmath58-subgroups  @xcite : the familiar isotopic spin ( @xmath59-spin ) group @xmath60 , with the spinor @xmath61 and singlet @xmath62 ; the @xmath63-spin group @xmath64 , with the spinor @xmath65 and singlet @xmath66 ; the @xmath67-spin group @xmath68 , with the spinor @xmath69 and singlet @xmath70 . in the framework of exact @xmath33",
    ", the photon corresponds to the @xmath63-singlet component of octet .",
    "it is sufficient for our present purpose to use any two of the three subgroups .",
    "most convenient for us are the isotopic spin and @xmath63-spin subgroups ( note that all members of any @xmath63-spin multiplet have the same electric charge ) .    with sufficient accuracy for our purpose here , we assume the nonet of ground state vector mesons to have ideal octet - singlet mixing , such that @xmath71 , while the @xmath72-meson contains light quarks only , @xmath73 . the ground state baryons are taken , as usual , to be members of an unmixed octet .",
    "for the antidecuplet , we neglect possible mixings , considering them to be parametrically small  @xcite .    in terms of @xmath63-spin",
    ", the proton belongs to the doublet @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , while the proton - like member of the antidecuplet , @xmath76 , enters the @xmath63-spin quartet @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "the vector meson nonet contains two independent @xmath63-singlet combinations , which can not change @xmath63-spin and , thus , can not transform @xmath79 .",
    "we may take them as @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( note that the @xmath63-singlet component of an octet may change the isotopic spin , as does the photon ) .    with the above @xmath63-singlet combinations , we immediately obtain two relations @xmath82",
    "the meson @xmath83 has @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "it is a member of a @xmath63-spin triplet , other members of which are the combination @xmath86 , with @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "when applying to this triplet the standard @xmath58 clebsch - gordan coefficients , which couple doublet ( @xmath90 ) and triplet ( @xmath91 ) into quartet ( @xmath92 ) , and accounting for relations ( [ eq : romph ] ) , we obtain a simple new relation @xmath93 it is then easy to use the standard isotopic ( @xmath59-spin ) relations and obtain the neutron couplings @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath96-like member of the antidecuplet .",
    "the proton - neutron relation for the @xmath97-couplings is similar to that for @xmath72 .    in the same manner",
    ", one can find @xmath0-couplings for transitions between the nucleon and @xmath5 , the @xmath6-like members of the antidecuplet . according to usual isotopic relations @xmath98",
    "while @xmath99-spin relations give @xmath100 evidently , all the couplings may indeed be expressed through one of them .",
    "we can take , for example , @xmath101 and then find @xmath102 in turn , the @xmath103-meson coupling may be estimated starting from the transition magnetic moment .",
    "a good approximation for non - hard electromagnetic interactions of hadrons is the hypothesis that `` the entire hadronic electromagnetic current operator is _ identical _ with a linear combination of the known neutral vector ",
    "meson fields ''  @xcite .",
    "this approach is now known as the vector  meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite ( for a recent brief review see the talk  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest form of vmd takes into account only the lightest mesons @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "then the transition magnetic moments may be expressed as @xmath106 in what follows , we will use @xmath107 only at @xmath31 , without showing this explicitly every time .",
    "the meson - photon couplings @xmath108 can be easily related to the partial widths of decays @xmath109 : @xmath110 assuming exact @xmath33 , the photon corresponds to the octet component with @xmath111 .",
    "the couplings @xmath108 then satisfy the group relations @xmath112 for illustration , let us consider how these relations , together with other @xmath14 relations ( [ eq : romph ] ) and vmd relation ( [ eq : magmom ] ) , result in the cancellation , @xmath113 should vanish , since the @xmath63-spins are 3/2 for @xmath76 , 1/2 for @xmath114 , and 0 for the photon . with the violation of @xmath14 , this transition moment becomes non - vanishing , but is still much smaller than @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "] of various contributions to @xmath113 : @xmath116 relations ( [ eq : gv ] ) , with an additional assumption @xmath117 , also predict that @xmath118 experimentally  @xcite , these ratios are @xmath119 evidently , @xmath14-violations are here less than @xmath120 . taking into account the difference of masses for @xmath121 , and",
    "@xmath122 one can see that the accuracy of ratios eq .",
    "( [ eq : gv ] ) is also not worse than @xmath120 .",
    "having in mind the current large uncertainties in properties of the @xmath123 , which we assume to be the @xmath124-like partner of the @xmath3 , we will take the @xmath14 relations to be exact .",
    "then , similar to the proton transition moment ( [ eq : ppst ] ) , we obtain the neutron transition moment @xmath125",
    "we are now ready to discuss the numerical values of various quantities .",

    "previously , in ref .",

    "@xcite ) and the above value of @xmath136 , calculations  @xcite find small cross sections @xmath137  nb and @xmath138  nb , which are below the limits given recently by the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "note the difference between proton and neutron targets .",
    "photoproduction off the proton is nearly independent of the width of @xmath3 , due to absence of the @xmath139-exchange .",

    "@xcite ) . on the other side , the neutron photoproduction @xmath143 is mainly determined by the charged @xmath9-exchange , which is proportional to @xmath144 .    to clarify the meaning of our numerical values for @xmath145",
