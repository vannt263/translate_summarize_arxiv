    "a major goal of the heavy flavor physics community is to find indirect evidence of new physics by studying neutral meson mixing and flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "these processes are mediated by higher order weak transitions and can receive sizeable corrections from new particles as predicted by several extensions to the sm .",
    "these new physics corrections are manifested in either an augmentation of the decay or mixing rate , or possibly by introducing new complex operators leading to unexpected sources of cp violation .",
    "the d  experiment operating at the fermilab tevatron has a rich heavy flavor program built on the excellent performance of the d  muon system .",
    "the large single and dimuon data samples are ideal for studying heavy flavor mixing and radiative decay . in this presentation , we focus on three results that highlight the strengths of the program : a search for the flavor changing neutral current transition @xmath10",
    "@xcite , a search for cp violation in @xmath5 mixing  @xcite , and our progress in measuring the @xmath7 mixing frequency  @xcite .",
    "these results are derived from a data sample of @xmath11 collisions at @xmath12 tev corresponding to a luminosity of approximately @xmath0 fb@xmath1 .",
    "the d  detector is a general purpose spectrometer and calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "charged particles are reconstructed using a silicon vertex tracker and a scintillating fiber tracker located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a @xmath13 t magnetic field .",
    "photons and electrons are reconstructed using the inner region of a liquid argon calorimeter optimized for electromagnetic shower detection .",
    "jet reconstruction and electron identification are further augmented with the outer region of the calorimeter optimized for hadronic shower detection .",
    "muons are reconstructed using a spectrometer consisting of magnetized iron toroids and three super - layers of proportional tubes and plastic trigger scintillators located outside the calorimeter .",
    "the d  trigger is based on a three tier system .",
    "the level 1 and 2 dimuon triggers rely on energy deposited in the muon spectrometer and fast reconstruction of muon tracks .",
    "for single muon triggers the muon is required to be associated with a track in the central detector with a transverse momentum of at least @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 .",
    "the level 3 trigger performs fast reconstruction of the entire event allowing for further muon identification algorithms , improved matching of muon candidates to tracks reconstructed in the central tracking system , and requirements on the @xmath16 position of the primary vertex . at higher luminosities",
    ", we increase the penetration requirements on the dimuon triggers , the momentum thresholds are usually raised to as high as @xmath17 gev/@xmath15 on the single muon triggers , and invariant mass or displaced particle filters are added at level 3 to enhance the heavy flavor content of the muon samples .",
    "the excellent agreement between observed fcnc processes involving down - type charge @xmath18 quarks such as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 with sm expectations have been used to set strict limits on new phenomena  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several scenarios of new phenomena such as susy r parity violation in a single coupling scheme  @xcite , or little higgs models with a new up - like vector quark  @xcite where deviations from the sm would only be seen in the up sector .",
    "scenarios of this nature motivate the study of fcnc charm meson decays .",
    "due to gim suppression , the sm rates for fcnc charm decays vanish in the limit of su(3 ) symmetry . the inclusive rates of decays such as @xmath22 are therefore expected to be dominated by long distance contributions where the dilepton system is produced via intermediate strong resonances such as the @xmath23 or the @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the decay @xmath25 that can only proceed via the long distance interaction where the dimuon system is produced by an intermediate @xmath23 meson .",
    "since this has no short distance contributions , the rate is given simply by the product of the two branching fractions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "just as the decay @xmath28 played a crucial role in benchmarking the studies of @xmath29 transitions , the observation of the cabbibo favored decay @xmath30 is an essential first step in the study of @xmath31 transitions .",
    "once this mode has been observed , the search for continuum production of @xmath32 can be performed by looking for an excess of @xmath33 candidates where the dilepton mass is inconsistent with resonance production .",
    "@xmath34 meson candidates are formed by combining two well reconstructed muons with a track in the same jet as the dimuon system and requiring the three particle system have an invariant mass consistent with a @xmath34 meson .",
    "if multiple candidates exist for a single event , the best candidate is selected based on the quality of the three track vertex , the transverse momentum of the pion , and the radial distance between the pion and the dimuon system .",
    "backgrounds from light quarks or random combinations are reduced further with variables that take advantage of the long @xmath34 meson lifetime and distinct decay topology .",
    "mass spectrum for the loose cut sample in the @xmath35 gev@xmath36 bin .",
    "the results of binned likelihood fits to the distributions including contributions for @xmath37 , @xmath33 , and combinatoric background are overlaid on the histogram.,width=302 ]     mass spectrum for the optimized @xmath37 sample in the @xmath35 gev@xmath36 bin .",

    "the line is a fit to the data in the sideband regions @xmath38 gev@xmath36 and @xmath39 gev@xmath36 .",

    "the @xmath34 meson candidates for events where the dimuon system has an invariant mass consistent with a @xmath23 meson are shown in fig  [ fig : dres1 ] for loose selection requirements and in fig  [ fig : dres1a ] for requirements optimized for resonance production and background suppression . in both plots a @xmath42 signal is clearly observed and in the optimized selection the @xmath33 signal is also seen with a significance above background of @xmath43 sigma . from this we extract the branching fraction @xmath44 which can be compared to the recent cleo - c measurement of @xmath45 or the expected value of @xmath46 given by the product of the @xmath47 and the @xmath27 branching fractions .",
    "having clearly established the resonance production , we turn to a search for non resonant @xmath34 production .",
    "the @xmath34 meson candidates for events passing tight requirements optimized for the non resonant analysis are shown in fig  [ fig : dres2 ] .",
    "the distribution on the left are again events where the dimuon system has an invariant mass consistent with a @xmath23 meson .",
    "we expect to still see some excess from the @xmath42 and @xmath48 signals and indeed based on the yields from the above sample we predict @xmath49 events ( signal plus background ) in the @xmath33 signal region and @xmath50 events in the @xmath42 signal region which compare well to the observed @xmath51 events in the @xmath33 window and @xmath14 events in the @xmath42 window .",
    "this indicates that even after the tighter selection we still have sensitivity at the level of the @xmath33 branching fraction measured above .",
    "the distribution in fig  [ fig : dres3 ] shows the @xmath34 candidates where the dimuon system has an invariant mass outside the @xmath23 window .",
    "here we see @xmath52 events in the @xmath33 window that are consistent with the expected background of @xmath53 events . from this , we set the @xmath54 confidence level upper limit @xmath55 this is the most stringent limit to date in the dimuon modes .",
    "although this is approximately 500 times above the sm expected signal it is already below the allowed parameter space of susy r parity violating couplings .",
    "the cp eigenstates of neutral @xmath5 mesons are a linear combination of the flavor eigenstates @xmath56 a difference in the coefficients @xmath57 would lead to cp violation @xmath5 mixing .",
    "the signature of @xmath5 mixing is like - sign dilepton events indicating that the initially produced @xmath58 system decayed as either a @xmath59 or a @xmath60 combination .",
    "the experimental signature for cp violation in @xmath5 mixing would be an asymmetry between the number of @xmath61 and @xmath62 final states .",
    "since the current experimental limits are slightly below the percent level , our goal is to measure the charge asymmetry between like - sign dimuons at the tenth percent level precision .    at d",
    ", we can reach the desired accuracy by taking advantage of the two independent magnetic spectrometers : the inner solenoid and the outer muon system toroid .",
    "the field polarities are reversed frequently leading to roughly equal data sets with the four possible combinations of field configurations .",
    "comparing yields in these data sets allows us to make precise determinations of all detector induced asymmetries .",
    "the raw event yields for different combined toroid solenoid polarities are listed in table  [ tab : nmumu ] for our @xmath0 fb@xmath1 data set .",
    "the like - sign dimuon asymmetry after removing detector effects is @xmath63 to extract the underlying cp violating semileptonic asymmetry @xmath64 from this number requires precise knowledge of the composition of our dimuon sample . besides our signal of direct semileptonic decay of both @xmath65 hadrons in the event , an important component of the sample is the coincidence of a primary muon from semileptonic b decay and a secondary muon from semileptonic charm decay .",
    "topologies like these that produce like - sign dimuons but are not associated with @xmath5 mixing dilute the asymmetry .",
    ".raw results . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nmumu ]    the most problematic component are asymmetries induced by hadronic interactions of kaons in the detector .",
    "reactions like @xmath66 have no @xmath67 analog . as the kaons travel through the detector the fraction of @xmath67 increases and leaving a larger number of @xmath68 from @xmath67 decay in flight than @xmath69 from @xmath70 decay in flight .",
    "we measure this asymmetry directly from reconstructed @xmath71 events in the data sample and subtract it from the above asymmetry .",
    "this is by far the largest source of systematic error in the analysis .",
    "a sensitive cross check of the sample composition is the extraction of the integrated @xmath5 mixing probability @xmath72 that can be extracted from the ratio of like - sign dimuons to opposite - sign dimuons . in our data",
    "set we find @xmath73 this can be compared to the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite value of @xmath74 . with our knowledge of the sample composition , we can then extract from the raw asymmetry the semileptonic asymmetry @xmath75 from which we extract the cp violation in @xmath5 mixing parameter @xmath6 @xmath76 this measurement gives the best sensitivity to cp violation in @xmath5 mixing to date and can be compared to the world average value of all previous measurements @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "measurements of flavor mixing in neutral meson systems have historically led to profound insights into physics at energy scales inaccessible to particle accelerators .",
    "the discovery of mixing and cp violation in the neutral kaon system  @xcite led kobayashi and maskawa to predict the existence of a third flavor generation  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of mixing in the @xmath78 system gave the first indication that the top quark is much heavier than the @xmath79 boson  @xcite .",
    "finally , mixing induced cp violation measurements in the @xmath78 system have precisely determined the phase of the cp violating top quark coupling arg@xmath80  @xcite .",
    "this motivates the study of mixing in the @xmath7 system .",
    "a @xmath7 mixing measurement allows a precise determination of the magnitude of the cp violating top coupling through the ratio @xmath81 and may lead to the discovery of new physics in @xmath82 transitions  @xcite .",
    "measuring the @xmath7 oscillation frequency requires knowledge of the @xmath7 flavor at both production and decay .",
    "signatures of mixing are candidates where the flavor at decay is different than the flavor at production .",
    "the mixing frequency can be determined by looking for an oscillation in the fraction of mixed events as a function of the @xmath7 decay length .",
    "the @xmath7 flavor at decay is determined by reconstructing a flavor - specific final state . at d",
    ", we use the semileptonic decay @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and charge conjugate states . the @xmath86 invariant mass distribution",
    "is shown in fig  [ fig : mds ] . in our 1 fb@xmath1 sample .",
    "we reconstruct approximately @xmath87 thousand @xmath88 candidates predominantly from @xmath7 decay and @xmath89 thousand @xmath90 candidates predominantly from @xmath91 decay .",
    "the @xmath7 flavor at production is determined by examining inclusive properties of the system recoiling against the @xmath7 candidate . in this way",
    ", we determine the flavor of the other @xmath5 hadron in the event that was pair produced with the @xmath7 candidate .",
    "we use a likelihood based tagging algorithm based on momentum weighted sum of the charge of particles associated with either a lepton , a displaced vertex , or the entire recoil system .",
    "fig  [ fig : mds]b shows the event sample when the flavor tag is required .",
    "the tagging purity of the combined likelihood is determined event by event and is calibrated by studying @xmath78 mixing in our @xmath92 sample .",
    "the figure of merit for tagging is the effective efficiency , @xmath93 , that takes into account both the efficiency of the tagging algorithm and the weight that each event receives in the final analysis due to the purity of the tag . in our @xmath94 sample",
    ", we measure an effective efficiency of @xmath95    the decay length of the @xmath7 meson is taken as the transverse distance from the primary vertex reconstructed using tracks originating in the beam spot , and the secondary vertex reconstructed from the @xmath42 and @xmath96 particles .",
    "to boost the decay length to the proper frame , we use mc to simulate the missing energy from the neutrino or other pions or kaons from @xmath97 decays .",
    "we require a very accurate determination of our decay length resolution so that we can distinguish a lack of a signal in our data from a lack of the ability to resolve a frequency beyond our resolution .",
    "we test our resolution model using prompt @xmath98 candidates from @xmath99 interactions . here",
