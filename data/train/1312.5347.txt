    "the cosmic history of star formation , typically summarised as the redshift evolution of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ; madau et al .  1996 ; lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; hopkins & beacom 2006 ; behroozi et al .",
    "2013 ) , is widely regarded as one of the benchmark measurements of galaxy evolution ; its precise measure is a key goal of modern observational astrophysics , and any model for galaxy formation must replicate these observations to be taken seriously .",
    "the rapid evolution of observational facilities in the last decade , in particular upgrades to the wide - field optical ( with the advanced camera for surveys in 2002 ) and near - ir ( with wide field camera 3 in 2009 ) capabilities of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , has resulted in robust estimates of the sfrd out to at least @xmath9 ( bouwens et al . 2006 , 2008 , 2011 ; mcclure et al .  2010 , 2013 )",
    "however , the hst view of the high-@xmath10 universe is effectively limited to rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths and hence to relatively unobscured galaxies .",
    "this limitation is worrisome , as populations of highly obscured star - forming ( 1001000m@xmath5yr@xmath11 ) galaxies are seen in the far - ir and submm ( e.g. hughes et al .",
    "large scale submm surveys have shown that the number density of these so - called ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) are dwarfed by the more moderate star - forming population at all redshifts ( e.g. reddy et al .",
    "2008 ) , although they do occur in large enough quantities to cause tension with numerical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. baugh et al .  2006 ; lacey et al .",
    "existing far - ir / submm facilities do not possess the sensitivity to probe even moderate sfrs ( i.e. sfr@xmath12m@xmath13yr@xmath11 ) at @xmath14 and hence the overlap in uv / optical and far - ir / submm identified galaxies at high redshift is small .",
    "this situation is clearly unsatisfactory ; to observe the full range in sfrs at high redshift requires measurements at two distinct wavelengths which can only be cross - calibrated in the nearby universe ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "deep , wide - area observations in the uv / optical would offer the observationally cheapest route to reconciling this disconnect .",
    "however , the strong relationship between sfr and dust obscuration means that the galaxies with the highest star formation rates may be amongst the faintest at the uv / optical wavelengths ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; hopkins et al . 2001 ; kewley et al .",
    "2002 ; reddy et al .  2010 ; roseboom et al .",
    "moreover , there is some evidence that uv / optical tracers of the level of dust obscuration ( e.g. the uv slope , @xmath16 , the ratio of balmer lines ) may only be accurate at moderate sfrs ( i.e. @xmath12m@xmath13yr@xmath11 ; reddy et al .",
    "2010 ; buat et al .",
    "2010 ; roseboom et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "thus there is no alternative but to push the sensitivity limits of sfr tracers which are not affected by dust obscuration . in recent years",
    "it has become de rigueur to build vast multi - wavelength datasets on a number of well - known extragalactic survey fields ( e.g. goods , lockman hole , cosmos , etc ) .",
    "while the disparity in observational capabilities across the electromagnetic spectrum has limited the usefulness of multi - wavelength studies of individual objects , the practice of stacking less sensitive datasets ( typically x - ray , far - ir / submm , radio ) at the positions of the deepest catalogued sources ( typically optical / near - ir ) , has become common - place . for imaging afflicted by white noise",
    "the stacked signal - to - noise should increase proportional to the square - root of the number of sources in the stack .",
    "hence for extra galactic fields with 10,000s of sources the aggregate , dust unbiased , sfrs can be robustly estimated at a level @xmath17 times fainter than the detection limit for individual sources . however",
    ", traditional stacking methods can only recover the mean ( or median ) sfr of any sample , and hence only the mean relationship between sfr and the binned variable can be established . to counter this",
    "it is common to bin the sources in more than a single parameter , e.g. the stellar mass - redshift plane ( oliver et al .",
    "2010 , karim et al .",
    "2011 , roseboom et al .",
    "this approach has the significant drawback of reducing the number of sources , @xmath18 , in each stack , which in turn reduces the stacked signal by a factor proportional to @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we present a statistical framework that allows the underlying distributions i.e. @xmath20 to be extracted in a parametric way from the stack .",
    "the clear advantage of this approach is that it allows the distribution in sfr to be constrained using all the available sources in a consistent way . to illustrate this point , karim et al .",
    "( 2011 ; k11 ) perform a stacking analysis with practically the same dataset we will use here ; optical / near - ir selected galaxies stacked into vla imaging in cosmos .",
    "they split their sample into @xmath21 redshift - mass bins and determine the mean sfr in each bin via median stacking of cutouts of the radio data around each source . if no binning is required , and the precision in the parametric fit scales as @xmath22 , then our method could provide estimates of the sfr-@xmath23-@xmath10 relation with @xmath24 times more precision ( @xmath25 if we still bin in redshift ) .",
    "these types of gains are non - negligible considering the observational expensive required to improve the raw sensitivity of large multi - wavelength datasets like cosmos by these factors .    in  [ sec : stackmethod ] is presented the method used to extract @xmath26 from a stack of galaxy positions ,  [ sec : data ] describes the datasets used to test this method , and  [ sec : sresults ] presents our results .

    "this is not an onerous requirement , the depth of optical / near - ir surveys is such that it is possible to construct complete volume or mass - limited samples out to high redshift .",

    "<S> the promise of multi - wavelength astronomy has been tempered by the large disparity in sensitivity and resolution between different wavelength regimes . here </S>",

    "<S> , we fit a model for the radio luminosity function ( lf ) of star - forming galaxies to pixel intensity distributions at 1.4ghz coincident with near - ir selected sources in cosmos . taking a mass - limited sample in redshift bins across the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 we are able to fit the radio lf with @xmath1dex precision in the key parameters ( e.g. @xmath2,@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is seen between our results and those using standard methods at radio and other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> integrating our luminosity functions to get the star formation rate density we find that galaxies with @xmath4m@xmath5 contribute @xmath6 per cent of cosmic star formation at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the scalability of our approach is empirically estimated , with the precision in lf parameter estimates found to scale with the number of sources in the stack , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this type of approach will be invaluable in the multi - wavelength analysis of upcoming surveys with the ska pathfinder facilities ; lofar , askap and meerkat .    </S>",
