    "<S> the main purpose of this article is to extend some of the ideas from schubert calculus to the more general setting of hamiltonian torus actions on compact symplectic manifolds with isolated fixed points . given a generic component @xmath0 of the moment map , which is a morse function , we define a canonical class @xmath1 in the equivariant cohomology of the manifold @xmath2 for each fixed point @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> when they exist , canonical classes form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of @xmath2 ; in particular , when @xmath2 is a flag variety , these classes are the equivariant schubert classes . we show that the restriction of a canonical class @xmath1 to a fixed point @xmath4 can be calculated by a rational function which depends only on the value of the moment map , and the restriction of other canonical classes to points of index exactly two higher . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the structure constants can be calculated by a similar rational function . </S>",
    "<S> our restriction formula is _ manifestly positive _ in many cases , including when @xmath2 is a flag manifold . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove the existence of integral canonical classes in the case that @xmath2 is a gkm manifold and @xmath0 is _ index increasing_. in this case , our restriction formula specializes to an easily computable rational sum which depends only on the gkm graph . </S>"
