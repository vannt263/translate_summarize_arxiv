    "the _ kepler _ spacecraft was launched in order to detect shallow transits produced by planets , which are characterized by their small radii , of the order of @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath7 , and therefore induce transits with shallow depth , of the order of @xmath11@xmath12 of the stellar flux @xcite . as of 2015 may , _ kepler _ indeed produced more than @xmath13 planet candidates , with orbital periods of @xmath14@xmath15 days @xcite . as a by - product of this effort",
    ", the _ kepler _ mission has also identified more than 2700 eclipsing binary ( eb ) systems @xcite , most of which exhibit much deeper eclipses .",
    "however , white dwarfs ( wds ) residing in binary systems are also expected to produce shallow eclipses , mimicking the transits of small planets .",
    "in fact , there are nine known ebs with wd secondaries in the _ kepler _ data @xcite .",
    "six of these were identified as short - period binaries of an f / a - type primary and a pre - helium wd secondary ( da+pre - he - wd ) , with radii of @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining three systems belong to different categories and had more `` standard '' derived wd radii of @xmath18@xmath19 @xmath7 .    other then the _ kepler _ discoveries , the stars v209 , 1swasp j024743.37 - 251549.2 ( hereafter wasp0247 - 25 ) , ogle - blg - rrlyr-02792 , and possibly aw uma , are ebs that are believed to accommodate pre - he - wd secondaries @xcite .",
    "of these , only wasp0247 - 25 was identified as a short - period detached da+pre - he",
    "- wd eb , which we consider as the binary type associated with the discoveries reported here . a significant recent contribution to the known population of short - period da+pre - he - wd ebs",
    "was made by @xcite , who discovered 17 such systems in the wasp photometry database @xcite .",
    "two of these have accurate measurements of the secondaries masses , radii , and @xmath20 , confirming that they are pre - he - wds .",
    "wds in short - period binaries are expected to be hotter than their primary stars , resulting in a light curve with a flat - bottom secondary eclipse that is deeper than the primary eclipse .",
    "this is because for a circular orbit , the primary - to - secondary eclipses depth ratio approximates the primary - to - secondary surface - brightness ratio in the observed band . indeed , except for the special case of kpd 1946 + 4340 , with a subdwarf b star ( sdb ) primary @xcite , the other eight wd systems in the _ kepler _ data exhibit a secondary eclipse that is deeper than the primary one .",
    "unfortunately , just from the primary and secondary eclipse depths , one can not tell if the companion is a low - mass star or a wd , as the primary and secondary eclipses can be interchanged . to overcome this ambiguity",
    ", @xcite looked in the wasp catalog for eb systems that show a _ deeper flat - bottom _ eclipse , indicating a hotter wd companion . using this method they discovered 17 short - period ebs with pre - he - wd secondaries .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a similar approach for the _ kepler _ eb catalog .",
    "they visually inspected the light curves of ebs with _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) @xmath21 k and discovered two new short - period da+pre - he - wd ebs .",
    "alternatively , one can use three photometric phase modulation effects , beaming , ellipsoidal and reflection ( beer ) , to distinguish between low - mass stellar and wd companions .",
    "the beaming effect , sometimes called doppler boosting , causes an increase ( decrease ) of the brightness of any light source approaching ( receding from ) the observer @xcite , with an amplitude that is proportional to the radial velocity ( rv ) of the source .",
    "therefore , the stellar rv modulation due to a circular - orbit companion will produce a sine - like beaming modulation at the orbital period , if the middle of the primary eclipse is defined as the phase zero point .",
    "the semi - amplitude of such a modulation is on the order of @xmath22@xmath23 parts - per - million ( ppm ) for low stellar - mass companions , compared to an order of @xmath24 ppm for jupiter - mass planets @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the phase of the beaming effect reveals which object is being eclipsed , and thus it enables distinguishing between a low - mass stellar companion and a wd companion , based on the eclipses relative depth .",
    "it is the same as the information that is provided by the phases when the radial velocity of the primary is blue shifted or red shifted .",
    "the second effect is the well - known ellipsoidal variation @xcite that is due to the tidal distortion of the star by the gravity of the companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a cosine - like phase modulation at half the orbital period , for a circular - orbit companion under the same phase zero definition .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation for orbital periods of a few days is on the order of @xmath25 ppm for low stellar - mass companions , compared to an order of @xmath24 ppm for jupiter - mass planets @xcite .",
    "the third effect is the reflection / emission variation , the result of light emitted by one component , scattered off of or thermally re - emitted from the dayside of the other component @xcite .",
    "this effect depends on properties that are associated with the response of the object s atmosphere to its companion s radiation , such as the bond albedo , the scattered light geometric albedo , and heat redistribution parameters .",
    "the reflection / emission modulation is expected to behave approximately as a cosine wave at the orbital period for a circular orbit , and can have different signs depending on the luminosity ratio and radius ratio of the two components of the binary . in the known _",
    "kepler _ systems with large - radii wd secondaries , this effect is dominated by light originating from the wd , scattered off of or thermally re - emitted by the primary star atmosphere @xcite .    to take advantage of the information provided by the beer modulations , the beer algorithm @xcite searches for stars whose",
    "light curves show a combination of the three effects amplitudes and phases that is consistent with a short - period companion .",
    "this work reports on the discovery of four additional short - period ebs of an a - type primary and a low - mass wd secondary ( da+wd ) in the _ kepler _ field , identified among the beer compact companion candidates as having a secondary eclipse deeper than the primary one .",
    "one system includes a pre - helium wd , similar to those in the previously known systems , while the other secondaries are well - developed wds , which were not observed before in short - period da+wd binaries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : beer ] presents the beer search and the resulting four detections , and section  [ sec : spec ] describes the spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] then presents detailed modeling of the _ kepler _ photometry , and section  [ sec : params ] describes the parameters resulting from the analyses of the photometric and spectroscopic observations . section  [ sec : indiv ] further reviews specific features of each of the four discovered systems , and section  [ sec : disc ] summarizes and discusses the results of this work .",
    "to identify wd secondaries , we applied the beer search algorithm , after adaptation for a compact object companion , to the _ kepler _ q2q16 raw long - cadence light curves of @xmath26 stars that were brighter than @xmath27 mag . the beer search assigned to each light curve a likelihood that the star hosts a compact companion , while identifying the inferior conjunction from the amplitudes and phases of the beer modulations . after sorting the stars",
    "based on their beer likelihoods , we visually inspected the @xmath22 highest - scoring light curves and identified four systems , kic 4169521 , koi-3818=kic 6515722 , kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 , in which there were two eclipses and the secondary was deeper than the primary .",
    "as indicated by its name , koi-3818 was a member of the koi catalog , listed as a false positive , but with an orbital period of @xmath28@xmath29 days that is half the orbital period we detected , while the remaining three systems appeared in the _ kepler _ eb catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] presents a short section of the raw _ kepler _ light curve of each of the systems , figure  [ fig : psd ] shows the amplitude spectrum of the light curves , and figure  [ fig : fold ] presents the four cleaned and detrended light curves folded at their respective orbital periods .",
    "cleaning of outliers and jumps and detrending were performed following @xcite . in the four systems the amplitude spectrum clearly shows the beer frequency peaks at the orbital frequency and its first harmonic , associated mainly with the beaming and the ellipsoidal modulations , respectively .",
    "the koi-3818 spectrum also shows peaks at frequencies of @xmath28@xmath30 cycles day@xmath31 and its harmonics ; kic 9285587 displays peaks in the @xmath32@xmath33 cycles day@xmath31 range .",
    "therefore in these two cases , cleaning also included fitting and subtracting several high - frequency sine functions , associated with the high - frequency spectra peaks ( see section  [ sec : model ] for more details about the cleaning and detrending process ) .",
    "each of the resulting folded light curves in figure  [ fig : fold ] shows ellipsoidal and beaming phase modulation , a curved bottom primary eclipse at phase zero , and a deeper flat - bottom secondary eclipse at phase @xmath34 , all being consistent with a fully occulted , compact hot companion .",

    "follow - up spectroscopic observations of the four stars were obtained with the tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ; * ? ? ?",

    "the tres instrument spans the wavelength range @xmath35@xmath36 , with a nominal resolving power of r@xmath2844,000 .",
    "the instrumental setup and observing procedures were as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were extracted and rectified to intensity vs.  wavelength using the standard procedures developed by @xcite .    for each target ,",
    "the pseudo - continuum of each spectrum was derived using a large - window @xmath37-percentile filter @xcite .",
    "for such a filter , a value of @xmath38 corresponds to a median filtering , while for @xmath39 the filter selects flux larger than the median .",
    "we empirically chose @xmath40 and a filtering window @xmath41 from the orders edge to the center of around @xmath42@xmath25 pixels , in order to obtain the best compromise on continuum matching for both narrow and wide lines .",
    "the same continuum derivation procedure was also applied to a library of synthetic spectra , with the parameters adjusted visually to @xmath43 and @xmath44 pixels , so that the model spectra better fitted the balmer lines .",
    "we later verified that varying these parameters by 10% had a negligible effect on the derived radial velocities and orbital solutions .",
    "the synthetic spectra were also broadened to match the tres line spread function , on the @xmath45 scale , and assuming a constant r@xmath2844,000 through all orders .    as our targets are hot stars ( @xmath46 k ) with wide and prominent balmer lines and narrower ca ii h and k lines and mg ii at 4481  , we tried @xmath47 fitting the different lines to the library of synthetic spectra , using an approach similar to @xcite .",
    "we did not observe a strong dependence of the surface gravity and metallicity on the @xmath47 , so we fixed them to fiducial estimates of @xmath48 dex and [ fe / h]=@xmath49 .",
    "optimizing the stellar rotation @xmath50 over the different lines gave consistent results that are listed in the upper section of table  [ table : rv_results ] .",
    "we could not constrain the effective temperature using this method , as different lines gave different optimized temperatures with deviations on the order of @xmath25@xmath51 k between the lines .",
    "we therefore kept @xmath20 as a free parameter when finding the optimized synthetic spectrum . for our subsequent analysis ,",
    "described in the next section , we adopted the most recent kic effective temperatures of q1q17 dr 24 from the @xcite , which were determined using a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "radial velocities were derived by cross - correlating the multi - order spectra of each target with the synthetic spectrum that gave the highest peak correlation value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "to estimate the primary mass , we used a method similar to the one used by @xcite .",

    "we then used the dartmouth stellar evolution tracks @xcite in the mean stellar density @xmath419 and effective temperature @xmath20 plane , to estimate the primary mass .",
    "next , using the rv mass function , we derived the secondary mass and thus got a better estimate for the mass ratio .",
    "we repeated this process with the updated mass ratio until the primary and secondary mass estimates converged to stable values , which required only two iterations for each of the four systems . to test this process , we also tried initial mass - ratio values of @xmath420 or @xmath421 , and in both cases it converged to the same final parameters estimates within only two iterations .",
    "figure  [ fig : evo ] presents the location of the four systems on stellar evolution tracks , for stars of a range of initial masses , in the density - temperature plane .",
    "[ h ]    using the masses of the two components of the binary we then derived the semimajor axis and the two radii using kepler s third law and the photometry derived parameters .",
    "the wd radius @xmath389 was estimated while also taking into account the gravitational - lensing effect on the primary eclipse depth @xcite .",
    "this effect is expected to be almost negligible for short - period low - mass wd companions .",
    "indeed , the effect was most prominent in our longest period system , koi-3818 , for which it inflated the estimated wd radius by only @xmath422 , or @xmath423 .      for a negligible luminosity companion ,",
    "the beaming phase modulation amplitude is proportional to the primary rv amplitude , with a proportionality constant of @xmath424 , where @xmath425 is the speed of light , and @xmath331 is mainly a function of the primary effective temperature @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath426 , where @xmath427 is the power - law index used by @xcite and @xmath428 is the photon weighted bandpass - integrated beaming factor used by @xcite . using this relation , we estimated the expected rv semi - amplitude from the photometric beaming semi - amplitude , @xmath336 , following the same method used by @xcite .    for koi-3818 , kic 2851474 , and",
    "kic 9285587 , our @xmath336 estimates are consistent with the spectroscopic rv estimates , @xmath372 , with deviations of @xmath429 , @xmath430 and @xmath431 respectively .",
    "for kic 4169521 our @xmath336 estimate is significantly lower than the spectroscopic @xmath372 .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that for this system the orbital - period cosine reflection - phase - modulation is more than @xmath24 times larger than the corresponding sine modulation .",
    "in such a case , a small phase shift in the cosine reflection modulation , due to stellar atmospheric effects , can significantly modify the sine phase modulation semi - amplitude , which we interpret as the beaming semi - amplitude .",
    "similar effects were previously observed for the wd secondary system kic 9164561 @xcite and for the hot - jupiter system kepler-76 @xcite .      in theory , for a co - rotating primary",
    "the mass ratio can be photometrically derived from the ellipsoidal amplitude combined with the scaled separation @xmath226 , the inclination , and the estimated effective temperature ( eq .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in practice this calculation usually results in large uncertainties that give little meaning for the resulting mass ratio .",
    "in addition , it has been shown theoretically and through observations in multiple cases that for a massive star with a radiative envelope , or for asynchronous primary rotation , the ellipsoidal derived mass ratio can be significantly different from the real one ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for these reasons we chose not to use the ellipsoidal modulation amplitude in order to derive the systems parameters .",
    "it is interesting , though , to compare the ellipsoidal derived mass ratio @xmath341 , with the mass ratio we derive from the combination of primary and secondary eclipses fitting , rv solutions , and stellar evolution models . for koi-3818 , kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 ,",
    "the ellipsoidal derived mass ratios are consistent with our mass - ratio estimates , at the level of @xmath432@xmath121 , @xmath433@xmath121 , and @xmath434@xmath121 respectively .",
    "we note , though , that this is merely due to the large relative uncertainty of @xmath435@xmath436 in the derived @xmath341 of these systems , making it of little importance . for kic 4169521 , @xmath341 , with a much smaller relative uncertainty of @xmath28@xmath437 ,",
    "is still consistent with our derived mass ratio at the @xmath438@xmath121 level .",
    "this result , which assumes a co - rotating primary , fits well with the consistency of the orbital period and the stellar rotation period of kic 4169521 ( section [ sec : rot ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to derive the expected first four beer amplitudes using eq .  1 of @xcite , and compare them to the amplitudes measured from the data .",
    "again , for koi-3818 , kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 , the resulting uncertainties are too high to provide any meaningful result . for kic 4169521 , however , for the 2nd , 3rd and 4th cosine amplitudes ( @xmath295 , @xmath307 and @xmath319 ) we find @xmath439 , @xmath440 , and @xmath441 ppm , respectively .",
    "these are very consistent with the beer amplitudes derived from the light curve ( table  [ table : sys ] ) , which again supports the co - rotation scenario of this system .      in general ,",
    "given enough time , tidal interaction in short - period binaries leads to synchronization , circularization and alignment of the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the data that we have at hand allow us to check if our four da+wd reached such a stable dynamical configuration .",
    "if true , we can assume alignment and test synchronization by using the spectroscopic projected rotation velocity @xmath442 , with the derived impact parameter and stellar radius , to estimate the stellar rotation period .",
    "table  [ table : sys ] lists the resulting stellar rotation periods of the four systems , under these assumptions . for kic 4169521 ,",
    "kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 , the resulting rotation periods are consistent with the orbital periods , but this may be attributed to their large relative uncertainty of @xmath28@xmath436 . for koi-3818",
    "this exercise gives a rotation period of @xmath443 days , far from being consistent with the @xmath1 days orbital period , suggesting a fast - rotating primary .",
    "in addition , the precise _ kepler _ data allow us to look for small orbital eccentricity , another aspect of the tidal interaction .",
    "this is done by deriving the secondary - eclipse time shift @xmath229 , and the secondary - to - primary eclipses durations ratio @xmath230 .",
    "we estimated @xmath444 from the secondary - eclipse time shift by taking the first order in @xmath445 of equation  1 in @xcite , after subtracting from it the expected rmer delay @xcite .",
    "next , @xmath446 was derived from the secondary - to - primary eclipses durations ratio , using the first order approximation in @xmath445 of equation  7 in @xcite .",
    "again , for koi-3818 we identify a small but significant eccentricity component of @xmath447 .",
    "the data of kic 4169521 are precise enough to rule out even such a small eccentricity , with a @xmath448@xmath121 upper limit of @xmath449 .",
    "unfortunately , the light curves of the other two systems , kic 2851474 and kic 9285587 , yielded larger upper limits , @xmath450 and @xmath451 , respectively , and therefore do not allow us to rule out eccentricities of the order of @xmath452 .",
    "in this section we review specific features of each of the four systems .",
    "this system is listed in the _ kepler _ eb catalog with an orbital period that is consistent with what we find , but with a primary eclipse time @xmath453 that is shifted by half a period , because the catalog defines @xmath453 as the time of the deeper eclipse .",
    "this system s orbital period of @xmath0 days is the shortest among the da+wd ebs discovered so far in _ kepler_. it is , though , within the period range of @xmath454@xmath455 days of the previously discovered such systems in wasp .",
    "it is also the hottest wd with the largest - radius of the four systems reported here .",
    "it is then not a surprise that the light curve of this system shows a significant reflection / emission modulation of @xmath456 ppm .",
    "this is likely due to light originating from the wd , which is scattered off of or thermally reprocessed and later emitted from the atmosphere of the a star .",
    "it is similar to the reflection / emission modulation observed for the wd secondaries systems kic 10657664 , koi-1224 , and kic 9164561 @xcite .",
    "such a modulation , in turn , can significantly modify the derived beaming amplitude , which is likely the case here ( see section  [ sec : kbeam ] ) .",
    "our analysis detects small but significant orbital eccentricity ( section [ sec : ecc ] ) and fast rotation of the primary , which highly deviates from synchronization ( section [ sec : rot ] ) , indicating an incomplete tidal interaction .",
    "in addition , the light curve of this system shows significant modulations at frequencies of @xmath28@xmath30 cycles day@xmath31 and its harmonics ( figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : psd ] ) . with a secondary - to - primary _ kepler_-band flux ratio of @xmath457 , it is safe to assume that the a - star is the source of this variability .",
    "this is similar to the photometric modulations , termed `` low - frequencies '' , seen in many a - type stars in the _ kepler _ data @xcite .",
    "there is an active ongoing research trying to explain the source of such modulations , with no clear conclusions .",
    "based of the harmonic structure of the modulation , and the consistency of its frequency with our derived stellar rotation period ( section [ sec : rot ] ) , we speculate that it may be associated with the a - star rotation .",
    "this system appears in the _ kepler _ eb catalog , with an orbital period and a @xmath453 consistent with our findings , but the catalog folded light curve mainly shows an ellipsoidal variation , with no visible eclipses .",
    "this binary features the most massive primary a - star of the four systems . for the a - star",
    "we derive a mass of @xmath458 and a radius of @xmath459 , suggesting that the primary has already started to evolve away from the main sequence .",
    "this is also indicated by its position on the stellar evolution tracks illustrated in figure  [ fig : evo ] .",
    "the light curve of this system shows significant modulations at the @xmath32@xmath33 cycles day@xmath31 frequency range ( figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : psd ] ) .",
    "similar to koi-3818 , the small secondary - to - primary _ kepler_-band flux ratio of @xmath460 suggests that the a - star is the source of this variability . these @xmath461 scuti - like pulsations are similar to high - frequency modulations seen in many a - type stars in the _ kepler _ data @xcite .",
    "we report the discovery of four short - period da+wd ebs in the _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "the 4 systems add to the 6 previously known short - period da+pre - he - wd ebs in the _ kepler _ data @xcite , and the 18 such wasp systems @xcite . all of the 6 _ kepler _ systems and 3 of the wasp systems have accurate measurements of the primary and secondary mass , radius , and @xmath20 .",
    "the new systems orbital - period range is @xmath0@xmath1 days , well within the @xmath454@xmath462 days range of the previously known systems .",
    "the masses of the wd secondaries of the new systems range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath4 , somewhat overlapping the lower edge of the @xmath2@xmath14 @xmath4 mass range of the known systems with derived secondary masses .",
    "each da+wd binary that we currently observe has evolved from a system in which the primordial primary was the progenitor of the current wd .",
    "such systems are believed to have gone through a mostly stable mass transfer from the wd progenitor to the current primary star , which gained a significant part of its current mass through this process @xcite .",
    "the wd evolution could involve several hydrogen shell flashes of the degenerate remnant , before it settles on the he wd cooling track @xcite .",
    "mass - transfer models predict a direct dependence of the final orbital period on the wd mass . to check this dependence , we follow @xcite and plot in figure  [ fig : pm ] the current orbital period as a function of the wd mass of the four new and nine previously known systems with derived masses , on top of the expected mass  period relation from @xcite",
    "( see also e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , all systems seem consistent with the mass  period relation , supporting the stable mass - transfer scenario .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the wd radii of the newly discovered systems . for kic 4169521",
    "we derive a bloated wd radius of @xmath463 , well within the wd radius range of @xmath16@xmath464 @xmath7 of the already known da+pre - he - wd systems",
    ". however , the wd radii of the other three new systems are in the range of @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath465 , the smallest wd radii discovered so far in short - period eclipsing da+wd binaries .",
    "this is reflected by the very shallow eclipses of these three systems , with depths on the order of @xmath22@xmath23 ppm , well below those of the previously detected da+pre - he - wd systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : wdevo ] shows the derived radii as a function of the @xmath20 of the newly discovered wds , together with those of the previously known systems with derived radii , on top of wd evolution tracks of a set of wd masses from @xcite . although @xcite derived the tracks for wd orbiting a neutron star , they suggest that this evolutionary stage of the wd does not depend on the nature of its companion .",
    "the figure shows that the known systems , together with kic 4169521 , all with hot and bloated wd secondaries , represent young systems probably at the pre - he - wd , or the initial wd cooling track stage @xcite .",
    "the three new systems  koi-3818 , kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 , are probably positioned further along the wd cooling track .",
    "reading from the evolutionary tracks of figure  [ fig : wdevo ] , we estimate the ages of the systems , measured from the end of the mass - transfer epoch , to be at the range of @xmath420@xmath466 gyr . these are roughly consistent with the ages of the a - star primaries that we derive from the stellar evolutionary tracks ( see figure  [ fig : evo ] and table  [ table : sys ] ) .",
    "the koi-3818 system , with its fast - rotating primary and very small eccentricity , can shed some light on the dynamical evolution of the binary .",
    "on one hand , the fast rotation of koi-3818 might indicate that the synchronization timescale is much longer than the age of the binary , measured from the end of the mass - transfer phase .",
    "on the other hand , tidal evolutionary models of short - period binaries predict synchronization and alignment timescales to be two to three orders of magnitude shorter than the circularization timescale @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the present small eccentricity is not a product of tidal circularization at the present phase , but instead is the result of the mass - transfer process .",
    "evolutionary models of the mass - transfer phase do predict fast - rotating primaries and very small eccentricities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the minute eccentricity component of @xmath467 that we derive for koi-3818 is about half of the eccentricity component of @xmath468 derived by @xcite for kic 10657664 .",
    "such small eccentricities are impossible to obtain from rv measurements alone , due to the small line - profile distortion expected for short - period binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "small eccentricities have been measured previously for pulsars , with wd secondaries in particular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , utilizing the precise timing of the observed radio pulses . obviously ,",
    "evolutionary models @xcite that include tidal interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should account for these non - zero eccentricities .",
    "it is also interesting to note that out of the four systems , only the primary of koi-3818 is a fast rotator , while the other three derived rotation periods of the a - stars are consistent with being synchronized .",
    "this may be because the binary separation to primary radius ratio , @xmath469 , of koi-3818 is relatively large , @xmath470 , while it is much smaller for the other three binaries  @xmath471 , @xmath472 , and @xmath473 for kic 4169521 , kic 2851474 , and kic 9285587 , respectively . as we can estimate the age of the four systems _ from their wd radii and temperatures _ ( figure [ fig : wdevo ] ) , we might be able to constrain the calibration of the synchronization timescale for stars with radiative envelopes .",
    "the exquisite _ kepler _ photometry led to the discovery of 10 short - period da+wd ebs , and has enabled to derive the masses , radii , and effective temperatures of both components of each system . together with the 18 similar wasp systems these open a unique window into the end products of binaries .",
    "in particular , we have discovered three da+wd systems with small , @xmath474 @xmath7 , wds , extending the known population to older systems with cooler and smaller wd secondaries .",
    "finally , the identified sample of 10 short - period da+wd eclipsing binaries in the _ kepler _ stars should enable us to estimate the statistics of this population and the fraction of a - stars with compact companions .",
