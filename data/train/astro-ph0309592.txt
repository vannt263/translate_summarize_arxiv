    "the present work is part of a comprehensive investigation of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) towards the southern coalsack and the chamaeleon - musca dark clouds .",
    "a comparison of the colour excess @xmath9 vs. distance diagrams for the chamaeleon - musca complex @xcite and the southern coalsack @xcite shows remarkable similarities .",
    "the jump of the colour excess to higher values occurs approximately at the same distance , and the observed minimum value of this rise is almost the same : @xmath10 .",
    "although the clouds are apart by more than 15 these facts suggested that they might be dense condensations embedded in an extended interstellar structure .    in order to investigate the possible physical association between these two clouds ,",
    "a new photometric investigation was carried out .",
    "the campaign resulted on very precise @xmath11 data for 1017 stars covering these clouds and the connecting area : @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the colour excess @xmath14 distance diagrams for these stars indicated that exists a foreground region with very little reddening ( @xmath9 @xmath5 0006 ) , that is bound , at the distance range of 150 @xmath15 30 pc , by a transition region where the colour excesses suddenly increase to a mininum value of @xmath9 @xmath5 0050 for the most diffuse lines of sight and @xmath9 @xmath5 0100 for the densest ones . beyond this transition region",
    "the diagrams suggest the existence of a second low column density volume , as the complete range of colour excess from @xmath5 0050 to @xmath16 , shown by the stars in the very narrow distance slot centered on 150 pc , remains unchanged for at least another 350 pc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the onset of this minimum colour excess for the whole surveyed area suggests that the obscuring material is distributed in an extended interstellar sheet - like structure .",
    "the existence of such an absorbing feature , at a distance identical to the molecular clouds , also suggests that coalsack , chamaeleon and musca can be dense condensations embedded on the diffuse medium composing the sheet - like feature .",
    "it has been also noted in paper i that the jump in @xmath9 , caused by the dust feature , seems to have a dependence on the galactic latitude that can be represented by @xmath17 = [ 0\\fm050;0\\degr ] \\rightarrow [ 0\\fm100;-8\\degr ] \\rightarrow [ 0\\fm150;-15\\degr]$ ]",
    ". the quoted dependence might indicate , if we postulate that the dust sheet is roughly perpendicular to the galactic plane , that the sheet does not have the same optical thickness , because @xmath18 _ vs. _ @xmath19 does not follow a simple @xmath20 law . on the other hand , it might also be the result of approaching the tangential point of a warped sheet - like structure with the same column density , curved away from the sun .",
    "as pointed out in paper i , when viewed in connection to the other data on the local ism , the existence of these two low - reddening volumes has led to the idea that the dust sheet could be part of a large scale structure , probably related to the interface of the local and loop i bubbles .",
    "such an interface of dense matter may have resulted from the compression of the ism by the action of energetic events of the sco - cen ob association from the far side ( @xcite ) and either by a supernova explosion near the sun or by whatever created the local low density region from the near side ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the dust sheet is part of a small bubble , it could be associated to the lcc - shell proposed by @xcite .",
    "note however that @xcite find that gas is moving out from sco - cen in the fourth galactic quadrant , but towards the association in the first quadrant .",
    "recently , observational evidences of an annular volume of dense neutral matter , that supposedly would have been formed during the collision of the two bubbles , was found on the rosat all - sky survey data by @xcite .",
    "remarkably , as noticed by @xcite , the molecular gas from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and @xmath23 seemingly define a large complex of clouds around 100 - 150 pc from the sun , comprising , e.g. , @xmath24 oph , r cra , g317 - 4 , musca , coalsack , chamaeleon and the lupus clouds .    in this case",
    "a schematic drawing of the interaction zone between the two bubbles and the dark clouds towards the sco - cen association would be like fig .",
    "the position and sizes of the dark clouds were obtained from @xcite and the ring - like contours from @xcite .",
    "the dashed square delineates the region surveyed in this work .        to investigate the kinematics of the interstellar gas components towards the coalsack , chamaeleon and musca dark clouds we have obtained high - resolution ( @xmath0 ) spectra of the interstellar  absorption lines . from the radial velocities , column densities , velocity dispersions and the known distance of the stars we aim to study",

    "in order to investigate the interstellar gas components towards the coalsack , chamaeleon and musca dark clouds 60 b - type stars covering the area defined by the galactic coordinates : @xmath2 and @xmath25 have been selected from the photometric @xmath11 sample by @xcite .",
    "all targets are located within 500 pc from the sun and have well determined colour excesses @xmath9 and photometric distances .",

    "the observations were carried out during 5 nights in april 1996 and 6 nights in april 1997 , using the remote control facilities at the eso s headquarters in garching bei mnchen ( germany ) .",
    "the ces optics was optimized to give a reciprocal dispersion of 1.8  / mm at the central wavelength of 5890  , resulting in a spectral coverage of nearly 60  .",
    "the entrance slit width of 459 @xmath40 m , used for all the observations , yielded an actual instrumental resolution ( fwhm ) @xmath41 m  or a velocity resolution @xmath42 = 5.3 km s@xmath27 ( fwhm ) .",
    "this corresponds to an actual resolving power of @xmath37 56000 , as determined by measurements of the intrinsic width of the thorium lines .",
    "the ccd was a loral / lesser 2688 x 512 , with 16 pre - scan pixels .",
    "it has a pixel size of 15 @xmath40 m @xmath43 15 @xmath40 m and is relatively free of blemishes . since the optical train selects only a single order , it was always possible to position the spectrum on a clean portion of the ccd .",
    "the dark current and the readout noise are very low , 1.8 @xmath44/pixel / hour at 164 k and 8.3 @xmath44 , respectively . the combined efficiency of the cat / ces using the long camera is about 8% in the used central wavelength .",
    "additional information regarding the cat / ces can be found in @xcite .",
    "multiple sets of bias , dark and flat - field exposures were obtained each night for calibration purposes .",
    "exposures of a thorium lamp were taken before and after each object exposure to ensure a better wavelength calibration .",
    "the ces , however , showed to be a very stable instrument .",
    "exposure times ranged from 2 minutes to 2.5 hours , depending on the visual magnitude and spectral type . in all cases",
    "signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) greater than 150 in the raw spectra were achieved .",
    "at least two exposures were obtained at each setup position and the integration times were limited to a maximum of 30 minutes to minimize the effects of cosmic ray events in the individual spectra .",
    "although _ hipparcos _ satellite was launched in 1989 august , the catalogue only became available in 1997 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the observing sample was selected based on our photometric distance determination . however , the paralactic distances may now serve as a basis for comparison with our photometric distances .",
    "a search in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue provided us 51 stars in common with our sample  one of them , sao239370 , appears with negative value for its trigonometric parallax , and was excluded from the comparison .",
    "[ hipparcos ] shows a plot containing the distances based on the _ hipparcos _ parallax vs. photometric distances .",
    "the denoted errors for the photometric distances were estimated for each star based on the individual uncertainties of their photometric measurements @xcite , and ranges from 11 to 49 per cent . in general , the agreemment is very good testifying the high quality of our photometric distance determination .",
    "there are few stars showing rather large discrepancy between their estimated photometric and parallatic distances , usually those beyond 200pc and large uncertainties in their trigonometric parallax .",
    "however , as will be seen further , the main interstellar structures discussed in this work are located nearer than that , and consequently these uncertainties in the distance estimation do not affect substantially our conclusions .",
    "the initial processing of the ccd frames employed iraf routines to subtract the bias , divide by a normalized flat - field , and remove cosmic rays from the rows occupied by the stellar spectrum and the background regions .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra were then extracted using iraf routines .",
    "it is worth reiterating that usually the dome flat - fields provided the best correction for the strong vignetting present in the spectra borders , besides that the affected parts were trimmed off the images .",
    "the wavelength calibration was established with a set of 20 to 30 lines , identified using the thorium line wavelengths of @xcite .",
    "a second - order chebyshev function was fitted to the line wavelength as a function of the pixel number , with rms scatter of the residuals about the fit smaller than 0.002   ( 0.05 km s@xmath27 ) in all cases .",
    "the dispersion solution was applied to all science exposures with no rebinning of the data , and the final spectra normalized to unity continuum with cubic splines .",
    "the individual normalized spectra were then co - added on a pixel - by - pixel basis , weighted by the inverse of the rms deviation of the continuum fit .",
    "no noticeable degradation in spectral resolution resulted from the co - addittion procedure , since the individual spectra have been obtained within an hour or two of each other , and the velocity changes in the observer rest frame , over this time scale , are very small compared to the instrumental resolution .",
    "numerous absorption lines arising from the earth s atmosphere occur in this region of the spectrum , and two lines in particular ( at 5889.637   and 5890.09  ) are very close to the rest wavelength of the d@xmath45 line .",
    "@xcite discusses the origin and identification of these atmospheric ( telluric ) lines in the  wavelength region . to reduce telluric line contamination",
    "the stellar spectra were divided out by a purely atmospheric absorption template spectrum obtained from a fast rotating , unreddened early - type star with no interstellar sodium , and taken at similar air mass . for both observing",
    "runs spectra of @xmath46leo and @xmath47lup were taken each night .",
    "the equivalent width of the  lines for these stars are estimated to be @xmath6 1 m  and 1.4 m , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stars sao251050 and sao224833 ( @xmath48lup ) , initially chosen as candidates for telluric line correction , showed the presence of interstellar  lines .",
    "since most of the telluric lines arise from water molecules , their strengths change throughout the night as the water content of the earth s atmosphere changes .",
    "hence , the template spectra were properly scaled to match the strengths of the atmospheric lines in the object spectra .",
    "the success of the atmospheric correction procedure is apparent from the fact that all the telluric lines , which are clear of the interstellar lines , have been satisfactorily removed ( see fig .",

    "the nearby feature is approaching the sun with average radial velocity of @xmath47 , has low average column density ( @xmath5 11.2 2 ) and is either hotter or more turbulent than the _ strong _ component , with velocity dispersion b @xmath5 5 .",
    "the more distant feature has column densities between 12.3 @xmath6 @xmath6 13.2 , average velocity dispersion b @xmath5 2.5  and seems associated to the dust sheet observed towards the coalsack , musca and chamaeleon direction .",
    "its velocity is centered around 0 , but there is a trend for increasing from @xmath43  near @xmath7 to 3  near @xmath8 .",
    "there seems to be a common envelope of minimum and maximum column density , centered in a narrow distance slot around 120  150 pc , that remains unchanged up to 350 pc , suggestting that a volume of low density may have been reached .",
    "after that , a third group of high negative and positive velocity components seemingly arise around 300 - 350 pc from the sun , however , without indications of an extended structure .",
    "details of the overall distribution of the ism ( @xmath1 500 pc ) along the studied direction have been extensively discussed in paper i. the kinematics of the nearby gas has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "details of the velocity structure in the region ( 360@xmath87 295  and 0@xmath88 30 ) , encompassing most of the sco - cen association , have been discussed by @xcite .    in the immediate solar neighbourhood",
    "the observational data suggest that the sun is located within but close to the edge of the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) .",
    "first identified from its kinematics by @xcite , the lic was modelled by @xcite as roughly spherical with dimensions of 58pc , warm ( t @xmath89k ) , low density ( @xmath90 0.1 @xmath91 ) and mostly neutral ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "its largest column density is about @xmath93@xmath94 towards @xmath95 , @xmath96 .    moving at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath97  towards @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the lic flows through the solar system and resonantly scatters solar hi ( lyman @xmath46 ) and hei ( @xmath100584 ) radiation .",
    "this flow , is referred to as the local interstellar wind ( lisw ) .",
    "the lic and other warm clouds with similar temperatures but a wide range of metal depletions , are embedded in an irregularly shaped region , whose radius ranges from 30 to 300 pc , and is deficient in dense neutral hydrogen compared to the galactic average ( e.g. @xcite ) . usually called local bubble , this cavity is thought to contain hot ( t @xmath5 10@xmath101 k ) , low - density ( @xmath102 @xmath6 0.025 @xmath91 ) gas and as recently shown by the rosat and euve shadowing experiments , coexists with the neutral atomic and molecular gas within its interior ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , worth noticing that @xcite has recently shown that heliospheric x - ray emission can account for about 25%-50% of the observed soft x - ray background intensities , which may put in doubt if the local bubble really contains the million degree hot gas .",
    "optical interstellar absorption line studies within 100pc of the sun show evidence of a flow of material analogous to the lisw . assuming that the sun is embedded within a single coherently moving interstellar wind , from a direction ( @xmath103,@xmath104 ) with velocity @xmath105",
    ", @xcite obtained the following vector ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) = ( 345 , @xmath410 , @xmath415 ) . in a similar analysis @xcite obtained ( 354 , + 3 , @xmath412 ) and @xcite obtained ( 301 , + 59 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "a possible description for this flow assumes that the lism is material which belongs to the surface of an expanding shell centered on the sco - cen association .",
    "@xcite has obtained an expansion velocity of 7  9 assuming the center at ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , the distance to the sun of 140 pc and the radius of 110 pc , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation for the existence of the neutral clouds and their predominant flow away from the sco - cen association is a consequence of the interaction between the local and loopi bubbles ( see sect.[lbli ] ) and subsequent local fragmentation of the interaction zone @xcite .",
    "since the closest star in our sample is at 65 pc the lic can not be addressed properly , neither the distance of the lower column density component . however , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the column densities of the nearby feature observed in this work should not be much closer than 50 pc from the sun .    for the latitude / longitude region observed in our work the velocities predicted by the interstellar wind flow vector and the expanding shell models give essentially the same results ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) . in any case",
    "the velocity of the low column density component is consistent with the previous results , and indicate an outflow from the sco - cen association .",
    "a more recent discussion by @xcite also using  line data and _ hipparcos _ distances proposes components at three distinct heliocentric velocities in the puppis - vela region .",
    "their component a with the velocity in the range from + 6 to + 9  covers part of the region presently discussed .",
    "@xmath94 , while open circles represent components for which @xmath108@xmath94 .",
    "note the well defined velocity distribution for the _ strong _ component and that it appears for stars beyond @xmath109pc . ]    from the distances of table 1 and heliocentric velocities from table 2 we construct fig .",
    "[ vel_dist ] of v@xmath110 vs. distance and notice that @xcite s component a is seen in two stars closer than 100pc and in fact seems present in all stars all the way to 450pc , this implies that component a covers all of our surveyed region , indeed a sheet nearer than about 100pc .",
    "two stars marginally have absorption features at component b s lower velocity limit ( 12 ) , these stars are at 100pc and 130pc respectively .",
    "otherwise component b is seen in most stars beyond 180pc ; the upper distance limit is very sharply defined by component b s upper limit at 15 .",
    "no stars beyond @xmath5350pc shows any indication of component b. component c ( 21  23 ) is virtually absent from our region and is only observed for galactic longitude less than 275  in @xcite s survey , far from our region .",
    "four stars closer than 100pc show absorption in a narrow interval from + 1 to + 4 , this interval is hardly represented between 100 and 400pc from where it is again present in almost any star .",
    "a fifth group of absorption has velocities between @xmath42 and @xmath44  for three stars between 120 and 140pc , lines in this interval disappear for larger distances but reappear between 300 and 400pc .",
    "locally , that is for distances less than 150pc , we confirm three interstellar kinematic groups with absorption lines in the intervals : [ @xmath45,0 ] , [ 0,5 ] and [ 5,10 ] the second of which represents the volume within 100pc whereas the other two both are present between 120 and 150pc .",
    "the local ism thus seems more complicated than proposed in @xcite investigation .",
    "one could speculate whether the interval [ 0,5 ] is representing the local undisturbed material and [ 5,10 ] and [ @xmath45,0 ] the expansion of the local and the sco  cen bubbles respectively ?",
    "[ vel_dist ] also indicates that the distribution of heliocentric velocities for the diffuse components changes character between 300 and 350pc .",
    "closer than 300pc there is a set of velocities exceeding 10 , this set disappears beyond 350pc . on the other hand a new set with heliocentric velocities smaller than 0  appears beyond 300pc .",
    "could this kinematic transition at 300350pc be connected to the expansive movement of the backside of the lower centaurus  crux feature being countered by an opposite motion ? the expansion has ceased at about 350pc and the counter motion halting the expansion is first noticed at about 300pc .      a soft x - ray shadow has recently been discovered on the edges of the loop i bubble , cast by a warped annular volume of dense neutral matter that supposedly formed during its collision with the local bubble @xcite .",
    "the shadow counterpart , a huge hi ring was also identified on the @xcite data .",
    "@xcite suggested that the steep increase of the column density caused by the annular feature , from less than 10@xmath111 to @xmath64 7 @xmath112 , occurs at a distance of @xmath5 70 pc from the sun .",
    "this distance is thought to be supported by results from optical and uv spectral analysis of stars near the center of loop i ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) by @xcite , who found the presence of a neutral gas wall of @xmath115 2  at a distance of 40 @xmath15 25 pc .",
    "see also the determination of the radial extent of the local hot bubble recently estimated by @xcite based on the _ rosat _ and _ iras _ all - sky survey data .",
    "however , for the hydrogen column density of the annular feature , the colour excess and the  column densities obtained in this work suggest that the interaction zone between the two bubbles is located around 120 - 150 pc from the sun .",
    "this result is corroborated by @xcite  an improved version of the 3d mapping of the local bubble cavity has been recently obtained by @xcite  where it is found that for the region investigated here the 2050m  isocontours at @xmath116 occurs at @xmath117pc , but at @xmath118 the distance is close to 70pc . the hydrogen column densities and velocities observed by @xcite are more consistent with our lower column density component at @xmath1 60 pc . in the same strip of latitude ,",
    "the wall of neutral gas has a column density @xmath119 2 , as suggested by @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the hydrogen column densities towards the interaction ring , used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "their fig .",
    "4 ) suggest a value around 3 @xmath43 10@xmath120 2  at 70 pc , also more consistent with our nearby feature .",
    "since @xcite have observed only unreddened directions our results cast some doubt on the distance to the interaction zone being located around 70 pc .",
    "it seems that the annular region is twisted and folded , with different directions having different distances .",
    "in addition to the velocities indicative of the flow of material in the last section , some of the more distant stars also have components at nearly 0 in the lsr @xcite . in the longitude range @xmath121 there are a number of low velocity ( @xmath122 @xmath123 ) components with generally strong  lines , consistent with the proximity of the @xmath24 oph and lupus clouds @xcite . in the longitude range @xmath124",
    "there are also several components , in the positive latitudes , with lsr velocities which are small but clearly negative ( @xmath122 @xmath125 ) .",
    "as mentioned in sect.[kinem ] , the feature around 120  150 pc observed in our work , has column densities suggestting that the gas is associated to the dust sheet observed towards the coalsack , musca and chamaeleon direction .",
    "it is certainly not appropriate to make generalizations exclusively from our data , but the fact that the velocities observed here are also in the same range ( @xmath126 @xmath127 ) , suggests that the dust and gas feature around 120  150 pc , seems to be part of an extended large scale feature of similar kinematic properties , supposedly identified with the interface of the local and loop i bubbles .",
    "the investigation of the interstellar gas components towards the southern coalsack , chamaeleon and musca dark have produced the following results :    * the interstellar gas is distributed in two extended sheet - like structures permeatting the whole searched area , one at @xmath1 60 pc and another around 120  150 pc from the sun .",
    "* the nearby feature is approaching to the sun with average radial velocity of @xmath128 , has low average column density @xmath5 11.2 2 and has velocity dispersion b @xmath5 5 .",
    "the more distant feature has column densities between 12.3 @xmath6  @xmath6 13.2 , average velocity dispersion b @xmath5 2.5  and seems associated to the dust sheet observed towards the coalsack , musca and chamaeleon direction .",
    "its velocity is centered around 0 , but there is a trend for increasing from @xmath43  near @xmath7 to 3  near @xmath8 . * in aggreement with several independent investigations the nearby low column density feature indicates a general outflow from the sco - cen association , while the dust and gas feature around 120  150 pc seem to be part of an extended large scale feature of similar kinematic properties , supposedly identified with the interaction zone of the local and loop i bubbles .",
    "assuming that the interface and the ring - like volume of dense neutral matter have similar properties , our results suggest that the interaction zone between the bubbles is twisted and folded .",
