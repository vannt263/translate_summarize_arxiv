    "in the following we consider a many - particle system with different species of bosons as it can be realized in optical lattices . @xcite this may either involve different atoms as , for example , in a binary mixture of @xmath6rb and @xmath7li , or one type of atom in different hyper - fine quantum states such as @xmath6rb , where the total nuclear spin @xmath8 adds to the spin @xmath9 of the valence s - electron , giving states with @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "such systems may be modelled by a generalized bosonic hubbard hamiltonian@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the occupation number operator for bosons of species @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 are hopping amplitudes of @xmath14-bosons and @xmath16 are local density - density interactions between @xmath17- and @xmath14-bosons on the same lattice site . an exchange interaction for spinor bosons can be easily included . in general the many - boson model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in unsolvable .",
    "the explanation of experiments with correlated lattice bosons in quantum optics and condensed matter physics requires a comprehensive theoretical scheme for the investigation of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in particular , it must be capable of describing thermal and quantum phase transitions and thus provide the phase diagram and the thermodynamics for the entire range of microscopic parameters . in the case of lattice fermions",
    "such a framework already exists : the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dmft has proved to be a very successful , comprehensive mean - field theory for models and materials with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "@xcite in particular , it provides a quantitative description of the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition , photoemission spectra , magnetic phases , and other correlation induced phenomena .",
    "the dmft has the virtue of becoming exact in the limit of infinite space dimensions @xmath0 or , equivalently , infinite coordination number @xmath1 , i.e. , number of nearest neighbors ( @xmath18 for a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice ) .",
    "@xcite this limit is well - known to produce mean - field theories which are diagrammatically controlled and whose free energies have no unphysical singularities ( e.g. , the weiss mean - field theory for the ising or heisenberg spin models).@xcite to obtain a physically meaningful mean - field theory the free energy of the model has to remain finite in the limit @xmath0 or @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite this requires a suitable scaling of the coupling parameters with @xmath0 or @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath20 , @xmath21= const . , for ising spins with nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath22 . while for the ising model",
    "the scaling is self - evident this is not so for more complicated models .",
    "namely , fermionic or bosonic many - particle systems are usually described by a hamiltonian consisting of several non - commuting terms each of which is associated with a coupling parameter , e.g. , a hopping amplitude or interaction . in such a case",
    "the question of how to scale these parameters has no unique answer since this depends on the physical effects one wishes to explore.@xcite in any case , the scaling should be performed such that the model remains non - trivial and its free energy stays finite in the @xmath19 limit . by `` non - trivial '' we mean that not only @xmath23 and @xmath24 , but also the _ competition _ between these terms as expressed by @xmath25\\rangle $ ] , should remain finite ; here @xmath26 denotes the quantum and statistical average of operators . in the literature on lattice bosons",
    "the @xmath27 limit was so far considered only in connection with the distance - independent ( `` infinite - range '' ) hopping of the bosons @xcite in which the mean - field theory of fisher _ et al_. @xcite for the bose - condensed phase becomes exact . as will be discussed below this",
    "is a static mean - field theory since normal and condensed bosons are not dynamically coupled . in particular , in the normal phase one has *",
    "@xmath28\\rangle = 0 $ ] * and the lattice problem is reduced to a single - site ( `` atomic '' ) problem where particles are immobile .",
    "another static mean - field theory is the bogoliubov approximation , which yields a good weak - coupling mean - field theory for bosons in a continuum . for lattice bosons this approximation fails to describe the mott superfluid - insulator transition .    evidently , a _",
    "dynamical _ mean - field theory is needed to describe the rich physics of interacting lattice bosons , e.g. cold atoms in optical lattices , @xcite within one conceptual framework .",
    "a comprehensive dmft for correlated lattice bosons , i.e. , a theory which can describe normal _ and _ condensed bosons on the same footing , did not exist up to now . in the following",
    "we will discuss the conceptual problems which prevented the formulation of such a bosonic dmft , and how they can be overcome .",
    "a macroscopically large number of bosons can condense into a single quantum state .",
    "this bec may be detected in the spectral decomposition of the one - particle density matrix @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for a boson at a lattice site @xmath32 , with @xmath33 as the corresponding wave function .",
    "for simplicity we discuss here only a single species of bosons so the index @xmath34 can be omitted .",
    "when bec occurs one of the eigenvalues becomes macroscopically large , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total number of bosons .",
    "the density matrix then decomposes into @xmath37where the second term corresponds to non - condensed , `` normal '' bosons .",
    "the first term has the remarkable property that it does not decrease even at large distance @xmath38 between the bosons at sites @xmath32 and @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 denotes the length of @xmath41 obtained by counting the minimal number of links between two sites on a lattice .",
    "by contrast , the second term in @xmath42 decreases with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath44 with @xmath45 as the amplitude for hopping between nearest neighbor sites @xmath32 and @xmath39 . for a uniform bec with density @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of lattice sites",
    ", one has @xmath48 such that the kinetic energy is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 to derive a mean - field theory for lattice bosons via the limit of high spatial dimensions the energy density @xmath51 needs to remain finite for @xmath0 or @xmath52 . since the energy density of the condensate , @xmath53 , is proportional to @xmath1 a non - trivial limit @xmath54 is obtained only if the hopping amplitude is scaled as @xmath55 , with @xmath56 = const . @xcite in the case of normal lattice bosons ( or fermions ) the situation is characteristically different . since @xmath57 is the transition amplitude for the hopping of a boson from @xmath39 to one of the @xmath1 neighboring sites @xmath32 the respective normalized hopping _",
    "probability _ is @xmath58 , whence @xmath59 . for the energy density of the normal bosons , @xmath60 , to remain finite for @xmath52 the hopping amplitude",
    "must therefore be scaled as in the case for fermions , namely , as @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite in the more general case of hopping between sites @xmath32 and @xmath39 which are not nearest neighbors , the amplitudes @xmath62 have to be scaled as @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( `` integer scaling '' ) if the bosons are quantum condensed and @xmath65 ( `` fractional scaling '' ) if they are in the normal state .",
    "the total energy of a single species ( @xmath66 ) of correlated lattice bosons described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is given by @xmath67    if the scaling of the hopping amplitudes in the limit @xmath68 is performed on the level of the hamiltonian ( or the energy @xmath69 ) two cases have to be distinguished :    \\(i ) : in the absence of a bec fractional scaling ( @xmath70 ) has to be employed to arrive at a finite value of @xmath69 for @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the interaction is purely local and hence independent of the spatial dimension of the system ; consequently @xmath71 need not be scaled at all .",
    "\\(ii ) : in this case integer scaling ( @xmath55 ) has to be employed .",
    "thereby the contribution of the condensate ( first term in ( [ full_energy ] ) ) remains .",
    "however , at the same time the contribution of the non - condensed ( normal ) bosons to the kinetic energy is suppressed @xmath72 .",
    "the normal bosons thus become immobile .",
    "it can be shown rigorously that the mean - field equations obtained in this way are equivalent to those derived by fisher _",
    "et al_. @xcite which are known to be exact in the limit of _ infinite - range hopping _",
    "( see section iv.c ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that the construction of a mean - field theory via the limit @xmath68 which is based on a scaling of the hopping amplitudes in the hamiltonian is either restricted to the normal state , or removes the normal bosons from the problem .",
    "this is unsatisfactory since the important _ dynamical _ coupling of normal and condensed bosons is then eliminated from the outset . during the last 15 years the problem of how to scale the hopping amplitudes without eliminating the normal bosons presented an unsurmountable obstacle for the formulation of a bosonic dmft .",
    "indeed , our discussion shows that such a theory can not be formulated on the level of a fully microscopic hamilton operator , i.e. , without making an additional bogoliubov mean - field type assumption.@xcite    at this point it should be pointed out that there exists no _ a priori _ condition according to which the scaling of the hopping amplitudes has to be performed in the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , for the free energy of the model to remain finite in the limit @xmath68 the scaling can equally be performed in the partition function ( or in the action entering in the functional integral which determines the partition function ) , from which the free energy is calculated .",
    "we will now show that the long - standing problem of the scaling of the hopping amplitudes with the coordination number @xmath1 or the dimension @xmath0 can be resolved by considering the large dimensional limit not in the hamiltonian but in the _ action _ determining the lagrangian density .",
    "namely , integer scaling is employed whenever a hopping amplitude is associated with anomalous expectation values @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while fractional scaling is used otherwise .",
    "the b - dmft obtained in this way treats normal and condensed bosons on equal footing and is thus able to describe both phases , _ including the transition between them _ , in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "the general structure of the b - dmft is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath75 the bosonic many - body lattice problem is mapped onto a single - site problem with integer occupation .",

    "their properties are determined self - consistently by the b - dmft equations .",
    "particles hop onto and off the site as a function of time , thus changing the total number of bosons of the reservoirs .",
    "therefore local correlations lead to a dynamical depletion or filling of the condensate .      here",
    "we present the self - consistency equations of the b - dmft for the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ; their derivation is discussed in detail in appendix a. the time evolution of @xmath14-bosons on the single site @xmath76 is represented by the local propagator ( green function ) @xmath77 where we used the imaginary time , finite temperature formalism and nambu notation @xmath78 ; @xmath79 is the time ordering operator .",

    "hence , the @xmath147-boson subsystem can not undergo bec and the occupation number operator @xmath154 of the single site becomes a classical variable with @xmath155 .",
    "the local action ( [ dmft1 ] ) is then quadratic in the bosonic operators .",
    "consequently , the local propagator @xmath156 for @xmath146-bosons and the local partition function @xmath157 , and thereby the bec transition temperature @xmath2 for the @xmath146-bosons , can be evaluated directly .",
    "the local partition function of the bfk model is determined by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the partition function for @xmath160 .",
    "the local propagator for normal @xmath146-bosons is given by @xmath161 here @xmath162 is the probability for the single site to be occupied by exactly @xmath163 bosons . for hard - core @xmath147-bosons ( @xmath164 )",
    "this leads to @xmath165 and @xmath166 . in this case",
    "@xmath167 rather than @xmath168 is used as an independent thermodynamical variable .",
    "the propagator ( [ green_fk ] ) describes quantum and thermal fluctuations of normal bosons . in the absence of the interaction between @xmath146-bosons , off - diagonal terms in the local propagator",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is then obviously exact and reduces to a homogeneous , linear equation of the form @xmath169\\phi_b(i\\omega_n)=0 $ ] for each fourier component .",
    "for @xmath170 the only solution is @xmath171 .",
    "the static ( @xmath172 ) component of the bec order parameter is finite if @xmath173 and must be determined by fixing the average density of @xmath146-bosons .",
    "a striking result obtained for this model is an _ enhancement _ of @xmath2 for increasing repulsion between the @xmath146- and @xmath147-bosons , with a maximum of @xmath2 at intermediate values of @xmath174 and a saturation at large @xmath174 .",
    "this behavior is explicitly seen in fig .  [ fig2]a for hard - core @xmath147-bosons ( @xmath164 , i.e. , @xmath175 ) on a simple cubic lattice where we plotted the relative change of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath176 in the non - interacting system .",
    "the increase of @xmath2 is due to the blocking of a fraction of sites by heavy atoms which increases the density of the @xmath146-bosons . however",
    ", this argument can not explain the non - monotonicity of @xmath5 vs @xmath174 shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the maximum is due to the correlation induced band splitting and the narrowing of the lower subband ( see fig .  [ fig2]c ) which lead to an increase and decrease of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , at fixed temperature @xmath177 the average condensate density @xmath178 is also found to increase with increasing repulsion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , although the interaction induced scattering between bosons usually removes particles from the condensate , thereby _ reducing _ its density .",
    "@xcite at zero temperature all @xmath146-bosons are in the condensate .",
    "similar results are found for other lattices , cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "these results originate from local correlations which are captured exactly by the b - dmft , but not by conventional approximations .",
    "the consequences can be inferred by considering the total density of @xmath146-bosons @xmath179 the second term gives the contribution of normal @xmath146-bosons for which the spectral function @xmath180 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c for different @xmath174 values .",
    "the spectral weight is seen to be strongly redistributed , forming lower- and upper - hubbard subbands at low and high energies @xmath181 , respectively , which are separated by the energy @xmath174 .",
    "we note that the splitting and rounding of the shapes are genuine correlation effects .",
    "the occupation probability of normal @xmath146-bosons , i.e. , the bose - einstein distribution function , decays exponentially with increasing @xmath181 .",
    "this implies an extremely small particle number in the upper hubbard subband at large @xmath174 .",
    "since the total number of @xmath146-bosons is constant , the particles are necessarily transferred into the condensate .",
    "hence , at fixed temperature @xmath182 _ increases _ , thereby enhancing @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral weight contributing to the upper hubbard subband is also proportional to @xmath183 , implying that @xmath2 increases with @xmath183 , too .",
    "the b - dmft prediction of an increasing @xmath2 and condensate density due to local correlations are expected to be observable in mixtures of mobile and localized bosons on three dimensional optical lattices .",
    "such correlations can thus be employed in the laboratory to enhance @xmath2 of bosonic condensates .",
    "we also note that on bipartite lattices with special densities of bosons , e.g. @xmath184 , long - range order in the density of the @xmath147-subsystem and , in turn , a supersolid phase in the @xmath146-subsystem is expected to form .",
    "obviously the physics of this seemingly simple bosonic model is extraordinarily rich .",
    "in this paper we derived the first comprehensive , thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for the investigation of correlated lattice bosons  a bosonic dynamical mean - field theory ( the b - dmft ) .",
    "in analogy to its fermionic counterpart the b - dmft becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions @xmath0 or coordination number @xmath1 and may be employed to compute the phase diagram and thermodynamics of interacting lattice boson systems in the entire range of microscopic parameters .",
    "the b - dmft requires a different scaling of the hopping amplitude with @xmath1 depending on whether the system is in the normal or the bose - condensed phase .",
    "this additional difficulty compared to the fermionic case prevented the formulation of the b - dmft in the past .",
    "as shown here it can be overcome by performing the scaling not in the hamiltonian but in the action .",
    "the b - dmft equations consist not only of a bosonic single - impurity problem in the presence of a self - consistency condition ( the momentum integrated dyson equation ) , but involve an additional coupling to the condensate wave function .",
    "we documented the comprehensive nature of the b - dmft by explicitly reproducing results previously obtained in special limits of parameter space and by deriving other bosonic mean - field theories .",
    "for example , by calculating the local - self energy of the b - dmft in the weak coupling regime , @xmath185 , in perturbation theory and by including all normal and anomalous terms to first order in @xmath186 one obtains the hartree - fock - bogoliubov self - consistent mean - field approximation.@xcite by neglecting the anomalous terms the standard bogoliubov theory for lattice bosons is recovered .",
    "inclusion of the second - order corrections to the local self - energy corresponds to the beliaev - popov approximation ( with the additional assumption of a local self - energy ) .",
    "furthermore , by neglecting all terms containing the hybridization function in the local action one obtains the mean - field theory developed in ref .   and refs .  , which corresponds to the exact solution of the bosonic hubbard model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the large dimension limit if only integer scaling is applied",
    "in contrast to previous mean - field theories the b - dmft constructed here treats normal and condensed bosons on equal footing . in particular",
    ", the b - dmft takes into account effects due to finite hopping and dynamical broadening of the quantum levels .",
    "the inclusion of the hybridization function leads to important changes of the results of the static mean - field theory .",
    "for example , the hubbard @xmath187-peaks in the spectral functions now acquire a finite width , and the mott transition occurs already when these bands start to overlap .",
    "we note that the b - dmft is not merely a perturbative improvement of the static mean - field theory @xcite with respect to the hybridization since in the b - dmft the hybridization function is included to all orders .",
    "we applied the b - dmft to solve the bosonic falicov - kimball model , i.e. , a lattice model of itinerant and localized , interacting bosons .",
    "due to the localized nature of the interacting bosons ( providing a type of annealed disorder to the system since the localized particles are thermodynamically coupled to the itinerant bosons ) the problem reduces to a set of algebraic equations .",
    "we find that local correlations _ enhance _ the transition temperature into the condensate and can thus be employed in the laboratory to increase @xmath2 .    in general",
    ", the local single - site problem of a bosonic impurity coupled to two baths ( the condensate and normal bosons ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "the development of a reliable bosonic impurity solver @xcite is a challenging task , which took several years in the case of the fermionic dmft .",
    "this process can also involve a formulation of the proper bosonic impurity hamiltonian corresponding to the b - dmft action derived here .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to present the foundations of a novel , comprehensive mean - field theory for correlated bosons and thereby instigate further research by analytical and numerical means .",
