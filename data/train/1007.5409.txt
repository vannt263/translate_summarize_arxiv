    "among classical magnetic superconductors there are three groups of cluster compounds , remo@xmath1s@xmath2 , remo@xmath1se@xmath2 , and rerh@xmath3b@xmath3 ( re = rare - earth ) which have been the primary systems for study of the interplay between superconductivity and long - range magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "although good quality single crystals of these materials have been available and measured for a long time a very interesting phenomenon was recently discovered in dymo@xmath1s@xmath2 due to very carefully conducted experiment  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon predicted in  @xcite and named two - step flux penetration was previously observed solely on ( @xmath4 ) errh@xmath3b@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the present work is inspired by this discovery and the hope that the same behavior could possibly be observed in some of the layered superconducting structures .",
    "the specific feature caused by the long antiferromagnetic order in the mixed state of a superconductor is the possibility of creation of the spin - flop ( sf)(or metamagnetic ) domains along the vortices  @xcite .",
    "this is easy to understand by taking two sublattices antiferromagnet as an example .",
    "an infinitesimal magnetic field applied perpendicular to the easy axis makes the ground antiferromagnetic ( af ) state unstable against the phase transformation to the canted phase ( sf ) . on the contrary , if the magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis the antiferromagnetic configuration is stable up to the thermodynamic critical field @xmath5 . when the field is further increased a canted phase develops in the system .",
    "let us assume that in an antiferromagnetic superconductor the lower critical field fulfils the relation @xmath6 and that the external field , @xmath7 , is applied parallel to the easy axis .",
    "then the superconducting vortices appear in the ground antiferromagnetic state .",
    "when the field is increased above @xmath8 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) approximately equal to @xmath9 the phase transition to the canted phase originates in the vortex core .",
    "the spatial distribution of the field around the vortex is a decreasing function of the distance from its center .",
    "hence the magnetic field intensity in the neighborhood of the core is less then @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the rest of the vortex remains in the antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "the radius of the sf domain grows as the field is increased .",
    "the above considerations apply to the classical superconducting chevrel phases as well as to the high @xmath10 superconductors , where antiferromagnetic order is produced by the regular lattice of re ions occupying isolating layers .",
    "in this paper we consider the structure shown on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that we believe simulates a real structure of many antiferromagnetic layered superconductors . a good candidate to show",
    "the above behavior should possess the isolating layers with the magnetic moments of re ions running parallel and antiparallel to the direction ( easy axis ) lying in the @xmath11 plane .",
