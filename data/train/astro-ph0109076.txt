    "a significant fraction of star formation in the universe may have occurred in high - intensity bursts . in the local universe ,",
    "starburst galaxies and spiral galaxies contribute roughly equally to the total number of massive stars , despite the fact that spirals are much more numerous @xcite . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "the faint blue galaxy population may be composed of dwarf galaxies undergoing intense , rapidly - evolving starbursts ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the lyman - break galaxies at @xmath3 show evidence for intense star formation @xcite .",
    "because starbursts are a significant source of massive stars , from the local universe out to @xmath3 , they are a fundamental part of understanding the star formation history of galaxies , and the chemical enrichment of the universe .    local starbursts make excellent laboratories for unraveling the starburst mechanism , because their proximity affords superb spatial resolution .",
    "local starbursts are quite similar to high - redshift ( z@xmath42.5 ) active galaxies in star formation rate @xcite , uv colors @xcite , and spectral morphology @xcite , although the high - redshift galaxies tend to have higher surface brightness than local starbursts @xcite . because of the many similarities , detailed photometric and spectroscopic studies of local starbursts can constrain the processes which govern star formation in active galaxies , and provide a foundation for understanding the high - redshift objects . in particular , we wish to address the following questions : ( 1 ) are starburst properties determined by global properties of the host galaxy ?",
    "( 2 ) what are the mechanisms that sustain starbursts ? ( 3 ) how long do starbursts last ?",
    "( 4 ) does star formation propagate in starburst galaxies ?",
    "what is the propagation mechanism ?",
    "( 5 ) do most stars form in clusters ( which then dissolve to form the field population ) , or are there distinct modes of star formation for forming clusters and field stars ?",
    "we are undertaking a study of local starburst galaxies to examine these questions .",
    "the subject of this paper is our photometric study of m  83 ( ngc  5236 ) , with an emphasis on its star clusters .",
    "m  83 is a nearby ( 3.7  mpc ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) starburst galaxy .",
    "it has a close dynamical companion in ngc  5253 @xcite ; these two very different galaxies contain similarly intense nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "the central starburst in m  83 spans 20  arcsec ( @xmath5 pc at 3.7  mpc ) , and presents a relatively complex morphology ( see   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the centrally - concentrated starburst of ngc  5253 , the optically - detected starburst in m  83 is contained in a semi - circular annulus between 3  and 7  ( 54  pc and 126  pc at 3.7  mpc distance ) from m  83 s optical center @xcite .",
    "this `` active ringlet '' region contains almost 400 star clusters brighter than @xmath6 mag , and 45 of these are bright enough to be detected in the shallower f547 m and f814w images .",
    "the nuclear region of m83 has several unusual properties , so we are not surprised to find that it hosts a complex starburst region . located within the main bar of m83",
    ", the center of the galaxy appears to contain a well - defined nuclear subsystem .",
    "a bright optical nucleus is offset from the center of the outer isophotes opposite to the starburst ringlet @xcite , and a nuclear bar may separate these two objects @xcite . dense molecular gas is present and generally concentrated to the north of the starburst ringlet @xcite , perhaps a result of material collecting around an inner lindblad resonance , as suggested by @xcite . near infrared spectroscopy by @xcite confirms that young populations are offset from the optically visible nucleus , corresponding to the optical starburst ringlet .",
    "@xcite find that the optically visible nucleus , as well as a second obscured nucleus at the center of symmetry , are dominated by older red giant stars .",
    "the picture emerging from these observations is of a complicated situation , where the absence of axisymmetry is playing a role in shaping ongoing events .",
    "the probable double nucleus suggests that another galaxy merged with m83 in the past ; its nuclear starburst was not necessarily triggered only by the interaction with ngc  5253 . since orbital time scales are short , @xmath710@xmath8  yr within the starburst ringlet , the asymmetric distribution of star forming activity evidently survived for several orbits to explain the observed variations in cluster ages ( see section  [ sec : agemass ] ) .",
    "furthermore , given the small distances involved and the near rigid body inner rotation curve found by @xcite , propagation of star formation even at the relatively low speed of 10  km  s@xmath9 suffices to produce a starburst on the scale of the ringlet in @xmath1010  myr .",
    "possibly , the starburst is a transitory flare - up of circum - nuclear star formation , in which molecular cloud complexes such as those now present around the nucleus are rapidly disrupted , rather than a long term event .",
    "the age distribution of star clusters can shed light on this issue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the observations and data reduction in section  [ sec : data ] ; photometry of the stellar clusters and dust corrections are described in sections  [ sec : phot ] and [ sec : dust ] , respectively ; age and mass determinations of the clusters are made in section  [ sec : agemass ] , while the properties of the diffuse population in the starburst site are described in section  [ sec : diffuse ] .",
    "we discuss the results of our study in section  [ sec : discuss ] , and summarize the paper in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "m  83 was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , in the broad - band filters f300w ,",
    "f547 m and f814w and in the narrow - band filters f487n and f656n , in two separate visits one  week apart during april - may , 2000 ( see figure  [ fig : colorimage ] ) .",
    "the log of the exposures , together with the exposure times and the characteristics of the filters are listed in table  [ tab : exp ] .",
    "images of the galaxy in the f502n and f673n filters were also obtained during the same visits and will be discussed in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "the central starburst of the galaxy is about 20   in diameter and is perfectly matched with the pc1 chip ( 36@xmath1136@xmath12 ) , on which it was centered .",
    "the telescope orientation was about @xmath1374.3 degrees off north , and the rotation between the images obtained in the two visits is small .    in each of the filters , two or three separate exposures were obtained to aid in cosmic ray rejection .",
    "the f300w filter probes the galaxy uv emission ; the f814w filter is the wfpc2 equivalent i band ; the f547 m filter is used here as a v - band equivalent , and was preferred to the wider f555w filter because its bandpass excludes the strong [ oiii](5007   ) nebular emission from the galaxy .",
    "the recession velocity of m83 is sufficiently small ( 516  kms@xmath9 ) that the two narrow band filters probe the hydrogen recombination emission lines h@xmath14(4861   ) and h@xmath15(6563   ) , respectively . the f656n filter is narrow enough to exclude the redshifted [ nii](6584   ) emission line ; however , the [ nii](6548   ) emission line falls within the filter s bandpass and represents about 15% of the h@xmath15 line flux in the filter , as inferred from spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced by the stsci calibration pipeline , which includes flagging of bad pixels , a / d conversion , bias and dark current subtraction , and flatfielding .",
    "hot pixels were removed using the stsdas routine warmpix , which uses hot pixel information from dark frames obtained around the time of the science observations to perform the correction .",
    "the reduced images were registered to a common position using linear shifts and small rotations ; cosmic ray rejection and co - addition were performed using the stsdas routine crrej @xcite , with a rejection threshold of 4  @xmath16 for the cosmic rays and 2.4  @xmath16 for the adjacent pixels .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration of the images is obtained from the zero - points listed in hst data handbook @xcite , and have about 2%5% accuracy in the medium and broad - band filters @xcite .",
    "the effect of contaminant buildup onto the wfpc2 window is negligible at optical wavelengths , and was also negligible ( less than 1% ) in the f300w filter in this instance , because the observations were obtained 7 days after decontamination .",
    "a correction of 2% to the total counts was applied to the narrow - band images to correct for the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) problem of wfpc2 @xcite .",
    "images of the nebular emission in h@xmath17[nii](6548   ) and in h@xmath14 were constructed by subtracting the stellar continuum from the narrow band images .",
    "the image of the stellar continuum underlying each of the lines was estimated from one of the broadband images ( f547 m and f814w for f487n and f656n , respectively ) .",
    "we used the optical spectrum of @xcite as a reference for determining a constant normalization factor applied to the broadband images .",
    "because of the galaxy s recession velocity , the h@xmath15 line falls close to the f656n red wing and a correction of about 25% was necessary to recover the full line flux ; the line flux was then corrected for the average value of the [ nii](6548   ) contribution @xcite , to obtain a final h@xmath15 image . a 2% correction for the filter transmission curve",
    "was applied to the h@xmath14 image .",
    "the effect of the underlying stellar absorption is larger for the weak h@xmath14 emission than for h@xmath15 .",
    "using red stellar objects to scale the continuum image to the narrow - band image can introduce a bias in the continuum subtraction of the blue stars , depending on the red stellar population .",
    "for example , an f / g type population has a relatively high h@xmath14 absorption equivalent width , which would lead to undersubtraction of the ob stars continuum ; on the other hand , a k - type population with small balmer equivalent widths ( ews ) would lead to over - subtraction of the blue stellar continuum . in this case , a default correction of 2     for the underlying stellar absorption was applied to the h@xmath14 image , but individual cases will be evaluated independently in the following analysis .",
    "the continuum - subtraction and calibration of the emission line images were cross - checked against the spectroscopic data of @xcite .",
    "fluxes were extracted from the images using the same aperture size and orientation of the spectrum ( 10@xmath1820 , with the largest size along the e - w direction ) .",
    "the aperture was centered at the peak of the optical emission in the images ( about the center of the pc-1 chip ) .",
    "the flux densities as measured from the images are only a few percent different than the values obtained from the spectrum convolved with the wfpc2 filters bandpasses , confirming the accuracy of our extraction .",
    "crowding in the starburst region of m  83 complicates the identification of star clusters , and the accurate extraction of their photometry .",
    "we opted for profile - fitting photometry , rather than aperture photometry , as the former allows us to disentangle partially overlapping clusters and derive accurate total fluxes in each band .",
    "in addition , profile fitting allows one to empirically check the accuracy of the local background determination ( a major source of uncertainty in aperture photometry ) . if the background of an object is poorly determined , it will leave a circular pixel - value discontinuity in the residual object - subtracted image .",
    "we can then iterate the fit until the residual image is smooth .",
    "profile fitting is typically applied to unresolved objects , which are well - described by a single point - spread function ( psf ) across the entire image or field .",
    "the star clusters in m  83 are resolved in the high angular resolution hst images ; in the case of resolved objects , psf fitting can only be applied if the object profiles are uniform . however",
    ", the clusters in our sample have profiles that vary in significant and complex ways .",
    "the half - light radius varies , and some of the clusters have a sharp core feature superimposed on a broader profile . as an added complication , the core feature can have a small , random offset from the centroid of the underlying profile . to circumvent these problems ,",
    "we convolve each of the images with a small gaussian kernel ( @xmath19 pixels ) , in order to get sufficiently uniform cluster profiles that can be well - fit by a single psf model .",
    "the gaussian kernel is large enough to homogenize the cluster profiles , and small enough that blending of clusters is not a concern ( 2 pixels corresponds to less than 2 pc at the distance of m  83 ) .",
    "we use daophot @xcite to perform iterative profile fitting on the gaussian - convolved images .",
    "objects are detected using daofind , with a @xmath20 detection threshold .",
    "we obtain preliminary photometry with phot , using a 3-pixel aperture . around 12 psf objects",
    "are selected with pstselect , and the best - fit profile is determined using psf with a psf radius of 11 pixels , and a fitting radius of 3 pixels .",
    "we allow psf to use all available functions in modeling the profiles ( gaussian , lorentz , moffat , and penny functions are attempted ) .",
    "the psf is then used to subtract objects from the image using substar .",
    "we examine the subtracted image for undetected objects near the psf objects ( which are added to the list of objects to be subtracted ) , and for poorly - fit psf objects ( which are removed from the list of psf objects ) .",
    "we then run psf again on an image in which objects near the psf objects have been subtracted .",
    "the images require between three and six such iterations to obtain cleanly subtracted images ( see figure [ fig : datimage ] ) .",
    "when we have obtained a satisfactory psf model , we use allstar to obtain profile photometry of all detected objects . since the magnitudes returned by the allstar routine are normalized to a 3-pixel aperture , we need to determine the aperture correction for each image to obtain total magnitudes .",
    "aperture corrections are difficult to measure directly in these images , because of the crowding of objects and the non - uniform background light .",
    "we therefore determine the aperture corrections using artificial objects , added to the relatively empty image regions outside the active ringlet region .",
    "artificial objects are added to each image using the daophot addstar routine , which constructs the objects from the image s best - fit psf .",
    "the artificial objects are placed in a uniform grid , separated by 26 pixels in each direction .",
    "this ensures that the psfs do not overlap , since the psf radius used is 11 pixels .",
    "once the artificial objects are added , we select objects in isolated regions of the frame , and perform both allstar photometry and concentric aperture photometry on the isolated artificial objects .",
    "the aperture correction is defined as the difference between the 13-pixel radius aperture magnitude and the allstar magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : apcorr ] shows a histogram of the aperture corrections from a series of f547 m frames with artificial objects added .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the peak to determine both the mean aperture correction and its contribution to the photometric errors .",
    "we find that the scatter in the aperture correction dominates the photometric error in all images ( note that because the distribution of aperture corrections has non - gaussian tails , these photometric errors may be somewhat underestimated ) .",
    "we also use artificial - object tests to determine the completeness limits in each image . in this case",
    ", we add objects to the populated regions of the image , so that the proper background levels and crowding environments are sampled .",
    "we estimate that the photometry is 90% complete to 19.0 mag , 19.1 mag , and 19.6 mag , and 50% complete to 19.8 mag , 20.3 mag , and 20.4 mag for the f300w , f547 m , and f814w images , respectively . because of the finite number of artificial objects used , the uncertainty in these completeness limits is approximately 0.2 mag .",
    "we convert these photometric completeness limits to an age - dependent mass limit in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "these artificial object tests also allow us to test the accuracy of profile - fitting photometry , relative to aperture photometry .",
    "we find that the profile - fitting photometry recovers the input artificial magnitudes as accurately as does aperture photometry .",
    "in fact , profile - fitting is somewhat more accurate in highly crowded regions , as we expected .",
    "we produce a photometric catalog of star clusters by positionally matching detected objects in the f300w , f547 m and f814w images .",
    "only objects which could be matched in all three images are included , and the final catalog contains 45 star clusters ( for a discussion of potential selection effects , see section  7 ) .",
    "the astrometry and broad / medium band photometry of the clusters in our sample are presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .    because the exposure time of the f300w image was twice as long as either the f547 m or f814w images ( table  [ tab : exp ] )",
    ", there are over 300 faint clusters detected in f300w , which were not detected in either f547 m or f814w .",
    "64 of these clusters were detected in f547 m , so we have at least the @xmath21 color for these objects .",
    "we can constrain the age of these clusters by examining the starburst99 model ( see figure  [ fig:2cd ] ) : all model points with @xmath22 are younger than 10 myr .",
    "we therefore estimate that at least 42 of the 64 clusters detected in both f300w and f547 m are younger than 10 myr .",
    "we also attempted to constrain the ages of the remaining f300w - detected clusters , by finding upper limits on their @xmath21 colors .",
    "however , the color limits are widely and uniformly distributed , so no significant constraint on the ages was possible .",
    "we present the astrometry and photometry of these f300w - detected objects in table  [ tab : uphot ] .",
    "we perform a similar profile - fitting photometry procedure on the narrow - band f656n ( h@xmath15 ) image ( see figure  [ fig : halpha ] , left panel ) .",
    "once the f656n magnitudes are determined , we calculate the h@xmath15 flux by using the same procedure described in section  [ sec : data ] for the f656n image as a whole .",
    "a one - to - one match between optically - detected clusters and f656n peaks can not always be found in our images , because the ionized gas associated with a cluster is not necessarily spatially coincident with the cluster .",
    "for example , evolving clusters can generate gas outflows that clear the cluster s region of gas and dust , as observed in the 30  doradus nebula by @xcite and @xcite . therefore , we choose to associate each peak detected in f656n with the nearest cluster , as long as the cluster lies within a maximum search radius . in this way",
    ", a single cluster can accumulate the flux from several nearby f656n peaks .",
    "because we are attempting to associate ionized gas with its photoionizing source , we include all clusters detected in f300w in this matching , regardless of whether they are in our final photometric catalog . in practice , it is difficult to choose an appropriate size for the maximum search radius .",
    "we present two limiting cases : a smaller radius of 5 pc , and a larger 12 pc radius .",
    "these two strategies yield identical f656n fluxes for all but three of the 45 bright clusters in our sample .",
    "there is one bright cluster ( #  28 ) for which no matching f656n peak could be found .",
    "we place an upper limit on the f656n flux associated with this object by measuring the flux in an 11-pixel aperture centered on the cluster in the peak - subtracted f656n image .",
    "the f656n flux is converted to an h@xmath15 flux using the procedure already described .",
    "we derive the equivalent widths of the h@xmath15 emission ( ew(h@xmath15 ) ) for each cluster from the h@xmath15 flux measurement , using the f814w flux associated with the cluster to estimate the stellar continuum . in section",
    "[ sec : agemass ] , we use the ew(h@xmath15 ) values to help constrain the cluster ages .",
    "the ew(h@xmath15 ) values are presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "we use the h@xmath15 and h@xmath14 images to estimate dust extinction corrections to the photometry .",
    "the distribution of interstellar dust is very complicated in the center of m  83 , because of the presence of an opaque dust lane @xcite and inhomogeneous dust and light distributions .",
    "we measure the ratio @xmath23 at each cluster location ( see figure  [ fig : halpha ] , right panel ) , and determine the @xmath24 color excess using the standard formula for foreground dust , appropriate for line emission in starburst galaxies @xcite , and adopting an intrinsic ratio r@xmath25=2.75 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ebvdist ] , we show the distribution of inferred e(b - v ) values for all pixels with @xmath26 .",
    "the significant width of the distribution and its tail to high e(b - v ) values underscore the importance of determining an independent reddening correction for each cluster .",
    "once the @xmath24 color excess is determined for each cluster , we use a two - component extinction model to deredden the photometry .",
    "the extinction model consists of a foreground milky way component ( @xmath27 ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an internal component that follows the starburst extinction curve @xcite : @xmath28    four clusters lay outside the region for which reliable extinction values can be determined using the @xmath29 ratio , because the signal - to - noise is too low in one or both of the narrow - band images . for these clusters , we correct the photometry along the reddening vector in the color - color diagram ( see figure  [ fig:2cd ] ) so that the corrected photometry matches the colors predicted by theoretical models ( see next section ) .",
    "if the cluster s reddening vector intersects the model curve at more than one point , we use the ew(h@xmath15 ) associated with the cluster to constrain the cluster s age , and use the age constraint to select among the possible model points .    correcting our images and photometry for the effects of dust using the starburst obscuration curve @xcite",
    "provides the best agreement overall between observations and models ( see section [ sec : agemass ] ) .",
    "for instance , if we were to use a model of foreground dust and a standard milky way extinction curve ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would end up with reddening vectors that are parallel to , but much longer than , those shown in figure  4 , with the result that most reddening - corrected clusters would end up with colors that are too blue to match any model .",
    "more complex dust geometries , such as a uniform mixture of dust and stars , could be appropriate for some of our clusters ( , the youngest clusters , and those close to the dust lane ) .",
    "mixed dust geometries produce less steep reddening vectors ( @xmath30  mag ) than foreground geometries , resulting in age estimates that are @xmath3120% older . in these cases ,",
    "age estimates from colors have been cross - checked against similar estimates from the ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "a general problem of using optical lines for deriving dust corrections is the potential of underestimating the amount of dust present . for foreground dust geometries",
    "this appears not to be the case , as larger dust corrections than those adopted here would again produce clusters colors that are too blue to be matched with the models .",
    "however , for those few cases where a mixed dust / star geometry is not excluded , there is a serious possibility of grossly underestimating the cluster s intrinsic luminosity and , therefore , its mass . for these cases ,",
    "our mass estimates are treated as lower limits in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "we can estimate the ages and masses of the star clusters in our sample by comparing our dust - corrected photometry and ew(h@xmath15 ) to the predicted photometry and ew(h@xmath15 ) from population synthesis models . for the comparison , we use the starburst99 models @xcite , which employ state - of - the - art isochrones and atmosphere calculations .",
    "we select an instantaneous burst population model covering the age range 1  myr to 1  gyr , with metallicity z=0.040 ( to match that of m  83 ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a salpeter imf , covering stellar masses between 1  @xmath32 and 100  @xmath32 .",
    "the models include flux from continuum nebular emission for very young populations .",
    "we convolve the model seds with the hst filter bandpass functions to obtain hst photometry for each model point .",
    "finally , we perform a piecewise linear interpolation between the original model points , to increase the effective photometric and age resolutions of the model .    in figure  [ fig:2cd ] , we present a two - color diagram , showing the observed and dust - corrected photometry of our cluster sample . the starburst99 model is also plotted ; age increases along the model from the upper left ( bluer colors ) to the lower right ( redder colors ) . for the most part",
    ", our cluster sample follows the model prediction well , although there are nine clusters whose photometry is strikingly dissimilar from any point along the model .",
    "we discuss these outliers below .",
    "we determine the ages of the clusters in our sample by simply adopting the age of the model point whose colors are most similar to the cluster s colors , and cross - checking the photometric age with the cluster s ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "we consider the age indeterminate if the color - distance to the nearest model point exceeds @xmath33 , where @xmath16 characterizes the photometric errors .",
    "there are nine clusters in our sample for which no age estimate could be made from the broadband colors .",
    "all of these clusters have ew(h@xmath15 ) in excess of 80   , indicating that they are young ( age @xmath710  myr ) . with the exception of cluster #  22 , their ( @xmath34 ) colors are 1 - 2 magnitudes redder than the locus of young model points .",
    "we also note that cluster #  4 , with a photometric age of 72  myr , has an ew(h@xmath15)-derived age of @xmath106  myr and occupies a similar position in the two - color diagram as the nine outliers .",
    "this object is particularly interesting , because it corresponds to a bright ir / radio source @xcite , suggesting this object is even younger than our ew(h@xmath15 ) estimate .",
    "we suspect the photometric anomalies may be related to the dust correction , for at least some of these clusters .",
    "specifically , objects 5 , 6 , and 7 ( the most anomalous objects in figure  [ fig:2cd ] ) each lie within the large dust lane that bisects the observed region",
    ". these objects are three of the four most extincted objects in the sample , according to our @xmath35 measurements .",
    "however , we note that no adopted extinction value or dust model can make the photometry of these objects consistent with the locus of young model points .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the dust geometry appropriate for these objects is much more complex than the geometry implied by our adopted extinction curve or other simple geometries .",
    "there is a well - known uncertainty when applying population synthesis models to relatively small populations like these clusters .",
    "the uncertainty is caused by the stochastic effect of luminous and rare red supergiant stars .",
    "the presence of these stars causes the `` red loop '' visible in figure [ fig:2cd ] . the shape and color of this loop can change dramatically in a small population , because only a few red supergiants are predicted , and random fluctuations in their actual number have a large impact on the integrated colors .",
    "however , because we find few clusters in the 1020 myr age range ( where red supergiants dominate the integrated colors ) , we believe the impact of this uncertainty on our results is minimal .",
    "in addition , there is a possible bias in cluster ages derived from ew(h@xmath15 ) values , because the starburst 99 models derive ew(h@xmath15 ) under the assumption that all far - uv photons are absorbed .",
    "however , we believe this bias has only a small effect on our derived ages . based on examining the diffused ionized gas in m  83 , @xcite find that only @xmath36 of ionizing photons escape into the general radiation field . to test the impact of this photon leakage on our cluster age estimates , we simulate full absorption of ionizing photons by artificially increasing the ew(h@xmath15 ) of the clusters in our sample by 20% . on average , the h@xmath15-derived cluster ages decreased by only 8% in this experiment .    in figure",
    "[ fig : agedist ] , we present the distribution of our cluster age estimates from both photometry and ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "approximately 85% of the 45 clusters in our bright sample are younger than 10  myr , and over half are in a narrow peak between 5 and 7  myr .",
    "figure  [ fig : agedist ] also shows the age distribution , excluding clusters less massive than @xmath0  m@xmath1 .",
    "the cluster sample is complete above this mass over the entire age range of figure  [ fig : agedist ] ( see figure  [ fig : massage ] ) .",
    "75% of these massive clusters are younger than 10  myr .",
    "the fact that the peak between 5 and 7  myr remains significant indicates that there was an actual burst of cluster formation at that time ; the peak is not just the young end of a more continuous cluster formation episode , whose older members have faded below our detection limit . nor is it likely that such massive clusters would evaporate on timescales as short as 10  myr .",
    "we determine the mass of each cluster in our sample by comparing the observed , extinction - corrected flux in each filter with the predicted flux of the corresponding model point .",
    "the mass associated with the model point is renormalized to that of a salpeter mass function over the range of stellar masses @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the lower mass cutoff provides mass estimates consistent with a more realistic imf with a turnover at low masses @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio between a cluster and the corresponding model point is assumed to be equal to their mass ratio . for clusters with photometrically - determined ages ,",
    "we obtain three estimates of the mass ( one for each broadband filter ) , and adopt the mean value as the final mass estimate . for ages inferred from ew(h@xmath15 ) , we derive the mass from the f814w magnitude only , as this is the least affected by the uncertain extinction correction .",
    "all but four of the clusters ( #  4 , 7 , 27 , and 40 in table  [ tab : phot ] ) have @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the clusters in m  83 are less massive than those typically found in a major merger galaxy like the antennae @xcite .",
    "we present two widely divergent age and mass estimates for cluster #  4 , based on its broadband photometry and its ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "we consider the photometric estimate less reliable , because the nearest model point in the two - color diagram is 4@xmath16 away , just barely within our 5@xmath16 cut .",
    "also , its large ew(h@xmath15 ) is convincing evidence that the cluster must be young .",
    "the masses of 10 of the clusters are lower limits because we can not discriminate a foreground dust geometry from a mixed gas / dust geometry ( see section  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "we measure the half - light radii of the clusters in our sample using concentric - aperture photometry of the unconvolved f814w image .",
    "we interpolate between the apertures to find the radius that encloses half of the total flux ( as measured by profile - fitting in the convolved images ) . finally , we correct for the instrumental psfs half - light radius , adopting 1.6 pixels for the f814w pc chip psf . in figure",
    "[ fig : radage ] , we plot the clusters ages against their half - light radii .",
    "there is some indication that the older clusters tend to have smaller half - light radii , although the trend is very weak .",
    "the results of these cluster measurements are summarized in table  [ tab : phot ] , where the adopted color excess , the half - light radius , the cluster mass estimate , and the age estimate are listed .",
    "having performed profile - fitting photometry on 45 clusters in our images , we can use the allstar routine to produce images in which the cluster light has been removed , leaving only the light of the diffuse field population . note that for the purposes of this discussion , we consider the 330 clusters detected only in f300w to be part of the diffuse population .",
    "we determine the mean ( @xmath34 ) and ( @xmath40 - @xmath41 ) colors of this diffuse stellar population by performing a @xmath42 blockaverage on the cluster - subtracted images , and constructing relative magnitudes from the averaged pixel values .",
    "the colors are simply the per - pixel differences in these relative magnitudes .",
    "we correct for extinction in each pixel using a similarly blockaveraged @xmath35 image , and applying the same two - component extinction model as we use on the clusters .",
    "finally , the underlying galaxy s red population is removed from the diffuse population colors by subtracting the average colors of the emission surrounding the starburst .    the two - color diagram for the diffuse stellar population",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig:2cd - diffuse ] .",
    "only pixels with s / n @xmath43 in each filter are shown .",
    "the curve represents a starburst99 model for a population with a constant star - formation rate , a salpeter imf covering stellar masses between 1 and 100  m@xmath44 , and metallicity @xmath45 .",
    "according to the model , most of the field is consistent with a constant star - formation rate starting 100  myr to 1  gyr ago , and all parts of the field contain stars that are at least 10  myr old .",
    "this is similar to what was found in ngc  5253 @xcite , although a much larger fraction of the field population in m  83 contains stars older than 100  myr . in figure",
    "[ fig : agemap - diffuse ] , we show the map of the field population s `` ages '' .",
    "it is important to note , these are * not * the average ages of the field populations .",
    "the model assumes that the star formation rate has been constant since some initial time @xmath46 .",
    "the map shows the distribution of @xmath46 .",
    "pixels with large @xmath46 values could still contain very young populations ; so large @xmath46 values are not necessarily inconsistent with the significant ew(h@xmath15 ) values throughout the region ( figure  3 , left panel ) . without knowing how well the constant star formation rate model fits the true star formation history , it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about the distribution of ages of the diffuse populations .    with this caveat in mind ,",
    "it is interesting to note the concentration of low @xmath46 values to the west of m  83 s optical center .",
    "this area also contains five young clusters ( age@xmath76  myr ; see figure  [ fig : agemap ] ) , is characterized by large values of ew(h@xmath15 ) ( figure  3 , left panel ) , and corresponds to the highest concentration of h@xmath15 flux .",
    "an area of 1.7@xmath12 radius around the peak nebular emission contains almost 20% of all the h@xmath15 emission associated with the central starburst ( the total being @xmath107.6  10@xmath47  erg  s@xmath9  @xmath48 ) ; the implied star formation rate is 0.02  m@xmath49  yr@xmath9 in an area of about 55@xmath1855 pc@xmath50 , or about 10%15% of the peak star formation rate per unit area found in local starbursts @xcite .",
    "this region represents the largest concentration of current star formation in the core of m  83 .",
    "the second large concentration of ew(@xmath51 ) lies nearby , on the opposite side of the dust lane .",
    "it is possible that the two observed h@xmath15 peaks are in reality one large star - forming area , bisected by the obscuring dust lane .",
    "the area appears to coincide with the 10  @xmath52 m emission peak reported by @xcite .",
    "the entire area around the northern side of the dust lane appears to be characterized by very recent , very active star formation .",
    "the bulk of the visible recent cluster formation in the central region of m  83 occurred southwest of the galaxy s optical center , in a circumnuclear ringlet between 3  and 7  ( 54 pc and 126 pc ) from the nucleus ( see figure  [ fig : agemap ] ) .",
    "the majority of clusters more massive than @xmath0  m@xmath1 are between 5 and 7  myr old , and these clusters are found throughout the active ringlet region . in contrast , the extremely young ( @xmath53  myr old ) clusters are found preferentially along the perimeter of the ringlet region .",
    "also , the interior of the ringlet region contains mostly low - level h@xmath15 emission , while its borders are lined by ridges of significant ( ew(h@xmath54 ) emission , culminating in the large h@xmath15 concentration at the northern edge of the active ringlet .",
    "the three clusters with ages between 10  myr and 30  myr are all located around the southernmost area of the ringlet , which also corresponds to the larger of the two h@xmath15 bubbles identifiable in the ringlet .",
    "clusters older than 30  myr are all located outside the ringlet ; however , we can conclude nothing about their origin from their present location : assuming random velocities of order 50 kms@xmath9 @xcite , the crossing time of the observed region is @xmath55  myr .",
    "star formation is clearly an ongoing process in the circumnuclear region of m  83 .",
    "the location of the youngest clusters and the h@xmath15 morphology suggest that star formation has propagated from the interior of the ringlet to its perimeter .",
    "it appears that the 57  myr population has evacuated interstellar material from most of the active ringlet region ; and that star formation is continuing along the edges of the region , where the gas density is probably still high .",
    "the age sequence from the presence of relatively old ( up to 25  myr ) clusters in the southern edge of the ringlet to the peak of recent star formation in the northern edge allow some tentative inference that star formation has been ongoing in the southern part of the ringlet for a longer time than in the northern part ; possibly , it has been propagating from one region to the other , a conclusion already reached by @xcite from near - ir images and by @xcite from the co and br@xmath56 emission of the region .",
    "the starburst zone appears to be quite compact ; propagation at velocities of @xmath1010  km  s@xmath9 would spread star formation over 150  pc in only 15  myr .",
    "the relationship between masses and ages for the clusters in our sample is shown in figure  [ fig : massage ] .",
    "the 90% completeness limits impose a minimum observable mass as a function of age ; this is shown as a solid curve in figure  [ fig : massage ] .",
    "our sample appears to be detection - limited at all ages .",
    "therefore , we can not say whether the lack of clusters older than 10 myr with m@xmath57  m@xmath1 is due to dynamical evaporation ( as predicted for the centers of galaxies ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to simple evolutionary fading of the lower - mass clusters .",
    "however , clusters more massive than @xmath0  m@xmath1 are not expected to evaporate on short timescales , so the fact that most massive clusters are between 5 and 7 myr old indicates that these clusters represent a true burst of activity , and not the young end of a continuous cluster formation rate .",
    "this model of a sharp recent starburst is also supported by the wholesale absence of dense gas across the ringlet , that explains the abnormally blue fuv spectral energy distribution observed in the center of m83 @xcite .",
    "such a complete removal of cool interstellar matter will not necessarily last , since gas can refill the region during a sound crossing time , or about 30  myr .",
    "the conceptual models developed for the evolution of the center of m83 by @xcite and @xcite appear to apply to these hst data .",
    "starbursts are associated with the rapid astration of molecular clouds .",
    "the material in these clouds likely is fed into the nucleus by the main bar , and possibly further shaped by an inner lindblad resonance and the influence of a nuclear bar . when a sufficiently massive cloud complex builds up , star formation occurs , and when sufficient gas is removed , it becomes optically visible as is currently seen in m83 .",
    "the masses of the molecular clouds now present in m83 of @xmath58 m@xmath1 @xcite could produce a starburst comparable to that which we see , with a star formation efficiency of @xmath710% .",
    "since the cloud sizes are also a few hundred pc , the duration of the event should be 10 - 30  myr . given the lack of star clusters with ages of @xmath5950  myr in our data , the typical time span between events should be longer than this , which still allows multiple bursts to occur in the last gyr and thereby fit the diffuse stellar population colors .",
    "if each event adds about @xmath60 m@xmath1 of new stars , then 10 events per gyr would just about suffice to produce the mass in the inner 100  pc of this galaxy .",
    "starbursts may have become a normal evolutionary event in m83 .",
    "the distribution of masses of relatively young ( age @xmath61  myr ) , massive ( mass @xmath62  m@xmath1 ) clusters ( figure  [ fig : imf ] ) provides a look at the cluster mass function ( mf ) for the m  83 starburst .",
    "the observed mf is reasonably consistent with the power - law cluster mf observed in the major - merger starbursts ngc  1741 @xcite and ngc  4038/9 @xcite ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , the mass function is based on only 25 young , massive clusters in our sample , and the dynamic range of masses is small , so the slope is only weakly constrained .",
    "our analysis of the hst wfpc2 images of m  83 indicates that this galaxy experienced a very recent starburst with a peak of massive cluster formation within the last 57  myr , and that the starburst may have triggered even more recent star formation activity along the perimeter of the starburst region .",
    "we measured both broadband ( f300w , f547 m , and f814w ) and narrow - band ( f656n ) photometry for 45 clusters in the central 300 pc of m  83 .",
    "we were able to determine the ages of 36 of these clusters by matching their positions in a two - color diagram to a starburst99 model , and constrain the ages of the remaining nine clusters using the ew(h@xmath15 ) .",
    "of these clusters , 39 are younger than 10  myr , and 25 are in the narrow age range 57  myr .",
    "clusters in this age range are distributed in a semicircular annulus ( the active ringlet ) , between 50 and 130 pc from the center of m  83 .",
    "we find that the five clusters with ages younger than 4  myr are found exclusively along the edges of the active ringlet region , suggesting an outward propagation of star formation .",
    "in addition , the presence of clusters older than 10  myr in the southern end of the ringlet and of current , intense star formation at the northern end suggests that star formation may have started earlier in the southern region and propagated northward , in agreement with a similar inference by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the look - back time on the star formation history of the starburst in m  83 is limited by the scant information provided by the few clusters older than @xmath1010  myr and by the diffuse population .",
    "the latter , made mostly of a @xmath43  myr population , may be composed of the remnants of evaporated star clusters .",
    "the limited information available precludes us from drawing strong conclusions about the origin of the starburst in m  83",
    ". the nearly identical time evolution of the starbursts in m  83 and ngc  5253 suggests a causal connection for the starbursts , such as a galactic interaction .",
    "however , perigalacticon in this system probably occurred between 1 and 2 gyr ago @xcite ; much older than the observed burst populations .",
    "the diffuse population in m  83 perhaps offers a glimpse of what remains of star formation triggered directly by this encounter , since much of the diffuse population is consistent with a constant star - formation rate starting at least 1 gyr ago .",
    "it is perhaps more likely that the present nuclear star forming activity in m  83 is driven and sustained by gas inflow from its bar instability .                        ,",

    "<S> we present a photometric catalog of 45 massive star clusters in the nuclear starburst of m  83 ( ngc  5236 ) , observed with the hubble space telescope wfpc2 , in both broad - band ( f300w , f547 m , and f814w ) and narrow - band ( f656n and f487n ) filters . by comparing the photometry to theoretical population synthesis models , we estimate the age and mass of each cluster . we find that over 75% of the star clusters more massive than @xmath0  m@xmath1 in the central 300  pc of m  83 are less than 10  myr old . among the clusters </S>",
