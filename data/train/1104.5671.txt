    "the investigation of the double beta ( @xmath6 ) decay is considered now as one of the most sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model of particles and interactions @xcite .",
    "the observation of the neutrinoless ( @xmath25 ) mode of @xmath6 decay could establish an absolute scale of the neutrino mass and the neutrino mass hierarchy , clarify the nature of the neutrino ( dirac or majorana particle ) and check the conservation of the lepton number .",
    "the process also depends on possible existence of light nambu - goldstone bosons ( majorons ) and hypothetical admixture of right - handed currents in weak interaction .    at present the two neutrino ( 2@xmath26 )",
    "2@xmath27 decay , process of nuclear transformation @xmath28 , was observed in 10 isotopes with the half - lives in the range of @xmath29 yr , while only limits on @xmath30 decays up to @xmath31 yr were set in numerous experiments @xcite .    the sensitivity of experiments to search for @xmath6 processes , which transform @xmath32 nucleus to @xmath33 : double electron capture ( @xmath8 ) , electron capture with emission of positron ( @xmath34 ) , and double positron ( @xmath35 ) decay , are on the level of @xmath36 yr @xcite ; even allowed in the standard model the two neutrino mode is still not observed decay of @xmath37ba was obtained in @xcite by geochemical method",
    ". however , this result has to be confirmed by direct counting experiments . ] .",
    "at the same time , the investigation of neutrinoless @xmath8 and @xmath34 processes could give an important information about possible contribution of the right - handed currents to the neutrinoless double @xmath38 decay rate @xcite .",
    "therefore developments of experimental methods to search for `` double beta plus '' processes are required .",
    "the @xmath1pt is one of the twenty two potentially @xmath7 active nuclei @xcite .",
    "the energy of the double beta decay is @xmath39 kev @xcite .",
    "the decay scheme of the @xmath1pt is presented in fig .  1",
    ".    it is also worth noting that in the capture of two electrons from external atomic shells , the energy release is close to the energy of the excited level of @xmath1os with @xmath40 kev @xcite .",
    "such a coincidence could give a resonant enhancement of the neutrinoless double electron capture in result of energy degeneracy .",
    "the possibility of the resonant neutrinoless double electron capture was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an enhancement of the rate by some orders of magnitude was predicted for the case of coincidence between the released energy and the energy of an excited state . according to @xcite , high @xmath41 atoms are strongly favored to search for resonant @xmath8 decay .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath1pt has the greatest @xmath41 value among the nuclei for which a resonant double electron capture is possible .",
    "unfortunately the natural abundance of @xmath1pt is very low : @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "perhaps this fact , together with the rather high cost of platinum , explains the absence of experimental results ( after the only one old study @xcite ) to search for @xmath6 decay of this nuclide .",
    "a modest limit on @xmath7 decay of @xmath1pt on the level of @xmath43 yr was calculated in @xcite on the basis of the early experiment @xcite with corrections on the decay energy , experimental efficiency and the natural isotopic abundance .",
    "another platinum isotope @xmath2pt is potentially @xmath44 active , with the energy of decay @xmath45 kev @xcite .",
    "the isotopic abundance of @xmath2pt is @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the decay scheme of @xmath2pt is presented in fig .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath11 decay of @xmath2pt to the first excited @xmath47 level of @xmath2hg can be searched for by using an external @xmath4 detector .",
    "the aim of this study was the search for double @xmath0 processes in @xmath1pt and @xmath2pt with the help of ultra - low background hp ge @xmath4 spectrometry .",
    "two platinum cups and one lid designed for chemistry purposes with the total mass of 42.53 g were used in the experiment .",
    "taking into account the isotopic composition of the platinum , the sample contains @xmath48 nuclei of @xmath1pt and @xmath49 nuclei of @xmath2pt .",
    "the search for double @xmath0 decay of platinum was realized at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso of the infn ( average overburden of @xmath50 meters of water equivalent ) @xcite with a p - type hp ge detector ( gecris , 468 @xmath3 of volume ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the spectrometer is fwhm = 2.0 kev for the 1333 kev @xmath4 line of @xmath51co .",
    "the data with the sample were accumulated over 1815.4 h , while the background spectrum was taken over 1045.6 h. the spectra normalized on the time of measurements are presented in fig .",
    "there is a certain difference between the pt and the background spectra , mainly due to the contamination of the platinum by @xmath52ir ( @xmath53 d @xcite ) .",
    "the activity of @xmath52ir is equal to ( @xmath54 ) mbq / kg .",
    "the radioactive iridium could appear in platinum due to the cosmogenic activation of pt by cosmic rays at the earth surface .",

    "however , the half - life of the ground state of @xmath52ir is @xmath58 d @xcite , and the exponential decrease in time of the @xmath52ir activity should be observed during our 75.6 d measurements . in fact , the behaviour of the counting rate in the f.e .",
    "468.1 kev @xmath4 peak of @xmath52ir can not be explained by this assumption ( see fig .",

    "the data is very well described ( @xmath59/n.d.f.@xmath61 ) by exponential decay with the half - life 241 y ( decay of @xmath62ir , see fig .",
    ", the @xmath52ir activity should be ascribed not to the ground state , but to the isomeric @xmath62ir level with @xmath63 kev and @xmath64 yr @xcite .",
    "this isomeric state decays to the ground state of @xmath52ir emitting 155.1 kev and 13.0 kev @xmath4 s which are however strongly converted to electrons ( coefficients of conversion are equal to @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite ) .",
    "this explains the absence of the 155.1 kev peak in our data .",
    "a peak at the energy 137 kev is caused by the @xmath67 decay of @xmath1pt to the lowest excited 137.2 kev level of @xmath68os ( the first evidence is reported in @xcite ) .",
    "we have also observed some excess of events in the 662 kev peak of @xmath69cs .",
    "the response functions of the detector to decays of @xmath70k , @xmath51co , @xmath69cs , @xmath52ir , u / th daughters in the platinum sample were simulated by egs4 code @xcite with initial kinematics given by the decay0 event generator @xcite .",
    "the activity of @xmath69cs and @xmath52ir , as well as upper limits on contamination by @xmath70k , @xmath51co and u / th daughters are presented in table 1 .",

    "the efficiencies of the detector to the double @xmath0 processes in the platinum isotopes were also calculated with the egs4 code @xcite and decay0 event generator @xcite .",
    "one positron can be emitted in the @xmath7 decay of @xmath1pt with energy up to ( @xmath77 ) kev .",
    "the annihilation of the positron will give two 511 kev @xmath4 s leading to extra rate in the annihilation peak .",
    "part of the spectrum in the energy interval @xmath78 kev is shown in fig .",

    "the difference in the areas of the annihilation peak ( @xmath81 ) counts , which can be attributed to electron capture with positron emission in @xmath1pt , gives no indication on the effect . in accordance with the feldman - cousins procedure",
    "@xcite we should take @xmath82 counts which can be excluded at 90% c.l .",
    "taking into account the detection efficiency ( @xmath83 ) , we have estimated a limit on the half - life of @xmath1pt relatively to two neutrino @xmath7 decay as :    @xmath84g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath86 yr .",
    "the detection efficiency in a case of neutrinoless @xmath34 decay is slightly lower ( 13.9% ) , which leads to the limit :    @xmath87g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath88 yr .    in the @xmath89 decay the first excited level of @xmath1os",
    "could also be populated with emission of @xmath4 quanta with the energy 186.7 kev .",
    "there is a peak at the energy of ( @xmath90 ) kev with the area ( @xmath91 ) counts in the spectrum accumulated with the platinum sample ( see fig .",
    "most likely this peak can be explained by @xmath67 decay of @xmath92u to the excited levels of @xmath93th .",
    "some part of the peak can be due to @xmath67 decay of @xmath94ra to the excited level 186.2 kev of @xmath95rn . at the same time we can not surely estimate a contribution to this peak neither from the decay of @xmath92u nor from the decay of @xmath94ra . for @xmath92u we set only the limit on activity of @xmath92u in the platinum ( @xmath96 mbq / kg ) .",
    "even much stronger limit ( @xmath97 mbq / kg ) was obtained on the activity of @xmath94ra by analysis of @xmath98pb and @xmath98bi peaks .",
    "thus , we ascribe very conservately 120 counts to the @xmath7 decay of @xmath1pt to the first excited level of @xmath1os , which leads to the following limit on the process : @xmath84g.s.@xmath99kev@xmath100 yr .",
    "however , a better limit can be set by using the estimation of the annihilation peak area ( the detection efficiency for the process is @xmath101 ) :    @xmath84g.s.@xmath99kev@xmath102 yr .",
    "the same limit was set for the neutrinoless @xmath7 decay of @xmath1pt to the excited 186.7 kev level of @xmath1os .",
    "the @xmath103 capture in @xmath1pt to the ground state of @xmath1os will give cascade of x rays and auger electrons with the individual energies up to 73.8 kev @xcite .",
    "the most intensive x ray lines should have the energies 61.5 ( 27.4% ) , 63.0 ( 46.7% ) , 71.1 ( 5.5% ) , 71.4 ( 10.6% ) and 73.4 kev ( 3.7% ) .",
    "contributions to the spectrum in this energy region ( see fig .  6 , a ) are expected from the decay of @xmath52ir , the excitation of pt by the decays of @xmath69cs , and also from the decays of u / th daughters contained in the materials of the detector . to set a limit on the process searched for , the energy spectrum was fitted by the model consisting of the sum of five gaussians ( to describe the expected 61.5 , 63.0 , 71.1 , 71.4 and 73.4 kev peaks in @xmath1os ) , two gaussians ( 65.1 and 66.8 kev x ray lines due to excitation of pt ) , and a polynomial function of the first degree ( background ) .",
    "a fit in the energy interval ( @xmath104 ) kev gives the area of the @xmath103 effect as ( @xmath105 ) counts .",
    "according to the feldman - cousins procedure we should take @xmath106 counts at 90% c.l . therefore taking into account the efficiency to detect the expected effect ( 1.9% ) we set the following limit on the @xmath103 capture in @xmath1pt :    @xmath107g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath108 yr .    the distribution of the excluded effect of the @xmath103 decay in @xmath1pt is shown at fig .",
    "6 , a.    the @xmath109 energy of @xmath1pt allows also the population of several excited levels of @xmath1os . in a subsequent de - excitation process , one or few cascade @xmath4 quanta ( together with conversion electrons and @xmath110 pairs ) will be emitted . to estimate limits on two neutrino",
    "double electron capture in @xmath1pt , the energy spectrum accumulated with the platinum sample was analyzed in different energy intervals .",
    "the results of the estimations are presented in table 2 , where the energies of the @xmath4 peaks , used to derive the limits , are also specified .    in the neutrinoless double electron",

    ". therefore , the expected energies of the @xmath4 quanta for the @xmath121 capture in @xmath1pt to the ground state of @xmath1os are in the intervals : i)@xmath122 kev for the @xmath123 ; ii ) @xmath124 kev for the @xmath125 ; iii ) @xmath126 kev for the @xmath127 process .",
    "there is only one peak at the energy of 1238 kev with the area ( @xmath128 ) counts in the spectrum accumulated with the platinum sample in the energy interval of interest ( @xmath129 ) kev ( see fig .  6 , b ) .",
    "more likely this is the @xmath4 peak 1238.1 kev from the decays of @xmath98bi ( daughter of @xmath94ra from @xmath130u family ) .",
    "it is rather difficult to estimate a contribution of the @xmath98bi @xmath4 quanta to the peak area because we do not know exactly location of the @xmath94ra contamination in the materials of the set - up .",
    "conservatively we assume that all the peak area is due to the neutrinoless @xmath131 decay of @xmath1pt .",
    "taking into account the calculated efficiency to detect @xmath4 quanta with the energy ( @xmath129 ) kev ( @xmath132 ) , it gives the following limit on the process searched for :    @xmath133g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath134 yr .",
    "there are no clear peaks in the energy intervals ( @xmath135 ) kev and ( @xmath136 ) kev expected for the @xmath125 and the @xmath127 processes in @xmath1pt .",
    "taking into account the calculated detection efficiencies for @xmath4 quanta with the energies in these intervals ( 4.6% ) and limits on the numbers of events of the effects ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 counts , respectively ) we have obtained the following limits on the @xmath25 double electron captures in @xmath1pt to the ground state of @xmath1os :    @xmath139g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath140 yr ,    @xmath141g.s.@xmath85g.s.@xmath142 yr .    limits on the @xmath121 decay of @xmath1pt to the excited levels of @xmath1os were obtained in the similar way as for the @xmath143 mode by analysis of the experimental data in the energy intervals where intensive @xmath4 peaks from the processes are expected .",
    "the limits on double electron capture in @xmath1pt to the ground and excited levels of @xmath1os are presented in table  2 .",
    "the atomic mass difference between @xmath1pt and @xmath1os atoms is very close to the energy of the excited level 1382.4 kev in @xmath1os .",

    "@xmath157 g.s . ) decay obtained in @xcite by a re - analysis of the early experiment @xcite .",
    "the search for the possible resonant @xmath121 capture to the 1382.4 kev level was realized for the first time . for future applications , taking into account the strong dependence of the resonant process on the difference in atomic masses of @xmath1pt and @xmath1os , precise measurements of the atomic masses are required .",
    "moreover , it would also be useful to precisely study the characteristics of the 1382.4 kev level of @xmath1os ( spin , parity , decay scheme ) .",
    "search for @xmath6 transition of @xmath2pt to the 411.8 kev excited level of @xmath2hg was carried out at the first time giving the limit @xmath158 yr .",

    "in particular , we have detected 7  mbq / kg of @xmath69cs and 40  mbq / kg of @xmath52ir in this platinum sample .",
    "the contamination of @xmath51co , @xmath94ra , @xmath159ra and @xmath159th does not exceed the level of a few mbq / kg , while the activities of @xmath70k , @xmath92u , @xmath130u are less than a few tens mbq / kg ( we assume a broken equilibrium in u / th chains ) .    to improve the sensitivity of the experiment we are going to increase the mass of the platinum by one order of magnitude .",
    "further improvements can be achieved by increasing the detection efficiency and the exposition , and obviously by using enriched @xmath1pt isotope .",
    "specially developed multi - crystal hp ge detectors could also be applied to reach a sensitivity to double @xmath0 processes in @xmath1pt on the level of @xmath160 yr .",
    "this would be particularly interesting also because of the possibility of a resonant double electron capture in @xmath1pt having such isotope the largest @xmath41 value ( the nuclear parameter which greatly favors the process ) among the nuclei where a resonant double electron capture could occur .",
