    "this was due to dislocations providing heterogeneous nucleation sites for @xmath0precipitates , leading to accelerated kinetics and a refinement of the precipitate size @xcite .    while it has been reported that re additions reduced the rate of overageing in mg - zn alloys @xcite , there have been no systematic studies on precipitation strengthening of mg - zn - y alloys .",

    "this phase exists in two - phase equilibrium with the matrix at high temperatures and precipitates as a grain boundary eutectic during solidification @xcite . in alloys with zn : y ratios close to the stoichiometry of the i - phase , therefore , little zinc is expected to be available for @xmath0phase precipitation and the precipitation hardening response is expected to be poor .",
    "this study set out to determine whether cold work prior to ageing could stimulate @xmath0precipitation in a wrought mg - zn - y alloy and to quantify the strength and ductility as a function of the precipitate size and distribution .",

    "the gradient measured for prismatic slip in mg - zn - y , however , is 6100mpa , greater than predicted by orowan equation calculations ( which predict 4760mpa ) .",
    "this suggests that the interparticle spacing ( and orowan strengthening ) is not well modelled for prismatic slip around low number densities of long ( @xmath34 nm ) precipitates . in such cases",
    "precipitate - dislocations interactions would be infrequent , but the particles would be extremely difficult to bypass .",
