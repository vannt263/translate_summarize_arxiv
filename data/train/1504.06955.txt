    "the high - resolution investigation of plastic flow in crystalline materials at microscopic scales shows , in contrast to its smooth macroscopic behavior , a bursty dynamics related to the nucleation and motion of lattice dislocations , with power - law statistics for the slip avalanches @xcite . theoretical work on these phenomena has been developed by using discrete dislocation dynamics @xcite , pinning - depinning @xcite , or automaton models @xcite , renormalization group methods @xcite , and continuum descriptions based on nye s dislocation density tensor @xcite .",
    "phase field methods have also provided fruitful tools for the analysis of many aspects of crystal plasticity @xcite .    as defect nucleation , annihilation , and movement originate from concentrated slip processes which accommodate large strains while locally striving to preserve the original lattice structure , here we propose a new nonlinear three - dimensional ( 3d ) phase field model accounting for crystal symmetry .",
    "this is described by the global symmetry group @xmath0 of crystals , conjugated to the group @xmath1 of unimodular @xmath2 integral matrices preserving 3d bravais lattices @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath0 dictates the location and distribution of countably - many relaxed states in the space of strain tensors ( see also a related approach in @xcite ) . in this framework",
    "the plastic distortion map @xmath3 is therefore discrete as it is @xmath0-valued , parameterizing the energy",

    "the discrete jumps in the plastic map @xmath3 are related to the presence of lattice dislocations in the material , whose long range elastic fields agree with the classical linear elastic predictions , emerge as non - compatible discontinuities of @xmath3 .    near any @xmath7",
    "the amount of shear along each principal slip direction of the crystal constitutes a scalar phase field component .",
    "these fields select the deformation path through energy minimization , and the coupling with the discrete plastic distortion allows the material system to explore the complex energy landscape induced by crystal symmetry .",
    "the evolving phase fields and body deformation lead in turn to a crystallographically - informed dislocation dynamics , driven by energy relaxation , which automatically accounts for the possible presence of simultaneously activated , interacting multiple slip modes , without the addition of supplementary hypotheses .",
    "the model can resolve isolated defects in the crystal as well as configurations possibly involving complex defect topologies . by simulating the behavior of the material under cyclic mechanical loading ,",
    "we show that this framework describes correctly various features of the plastic flow in crystalline materials , and sheds new light on the properties of the associated scale - free intermittent behavior at microscopic scales .",

    "an exception to this general behavior occurs when , during the evolution of @xmath62 , the resulting @xmath29 in ( [ fpl1])@xmath36 is not isochoric .",

    "however , ( [ updatefg ] ) represents a significant novelty of the present approach , as it enforces the condition that the material locally reaches a stress - free equilibrium through ( [ s1])-([updatefg ] ) only if @xmath4 belongs to @xmath0 modulo an orthogonal transformation .",

    "<S> this generates a complex energy landscape with countably - many @xmath0-related wells in strain space , whereon the material evolves by energy minimization under the loading through spontaneous slip processes inducing the creation and motion of dislocations without the need of auxiliary hypotheses . </S>",
    "<S> multiple slips may be activated simultaneously , in domains separated by a priori unknown free boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the wells visited by the strain at each position and time , are tracked by the evolution of a @xmath0-valued discrete plastic map , whose non - compatible discontinuities identify lattice dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> the main effects in the plasticity of crystalline materials at microscopic scales emerge in this framework , including the long - range elastic fields of possibly interacting dislocations , lattice friction , hardening , band - like vs.  complex spatial distributions of dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> the main results concern the scale - free intermittency of the flow , with power - law exponents for the slip avalanche statistics which are significantly affected by the symmetry and the compatibility properties of the activated fundamental shears . </S>"
