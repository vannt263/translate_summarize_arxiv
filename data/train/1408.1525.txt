    "the advent of high @xmath3 superconductivity @xcite had made it enlightening and relevant to locate different phase boundaries in the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space @xcite , depicting the various possible phase transformations for the vortex matter in a type - ii superconductor .",
    "a widely investigated anomaly elucidating the features of the vortex phase diagram of a high @xmath3 cuprate superconductor , yba@xmath6cu@xmath0o@xmath7 ( ybco ) @xcite , has been the peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon @xcite , which amounts to a sudden increase in the otherwise monotonically decreasing critical current density ( @xmath8 ) just before reaching the upper critical field line , @xmath9 . as per the larkin - ovchinnikov @xcite description",
    ", @xmath8 is related inversely to the volume ( @xmath10 ) ( @xmath11 ) of the domain within which the displacements of the individual flux lines remain well correlated .",
    "hence , an anomalous increase in @xmath12 ( as in pe phenomenon ) signifies a shrinkage in @xmath10 , which in turn , amounts to an order - disorder transformation of the vortex matter . somewhat analogous to the pe",
    ", there is another anomalous feature occurring deep inside the mixed state ( well below @xmath13 ) , called the second magnetization peak ( smp ) @xcite which also imprints as a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath14 .",
    "the smp feature has been well studied in high @xmath3 cuprate superconductors , yba@xmath6cu@xmath0o@xmath7 ( ybco ) @xcite , bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath15 ( bscco ) @xcite and another oxide superconductor , ( ba , k)bio system@xcite .    as an important consequence of the above mentioned studies of the vortex phase transformations in the high @xmath3 superconductors , the pe / smp behavior and the vortex phase diagrams have been revisited various times in several conventional superconductors , such as , nb @xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath6 @xcite , yni@xmath6b@xmath6c @xcite , luni@xmath6b@xmath6c @xcite ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite , yb@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite etc .",
    ", the order - disorder transitions ( _ a la _ pe and smp ) reported in ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 ( carhsn ) by some of the present authors @xcite bore a marked resemblance with characteristic results in some single crystals of the high @xmath3 superconductor ybco .",
    "in addition , a recent report @xcite of an exemplification of the notion of inverse melting of the vortex lattice in a crystal of carhsn echoes well with the similar characteristic in the high @xmath3 superconductors ybco @xcite and bscco @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned investigations in the low @xmath3 superconductors have thus lead to the revelation of many instructive aspects of the pe and the smp anomalies . for example , the results of small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) together with ac susceptibility measurements performed concurrently in a single crystal of nb provided convincing evidence of a quasi - first - order transition , from flux line lattice to amorphous vortex solid , across the onset of the pe anomaly @xcite .",
    "the smp on the other hand , is widely accepted @xcite as a disorder or pinning - induced transition amounting to a well ordered bragg glass ( bg ) state transforming to a _ multi - domain _ vortex glass ( vg ) phase @xcite .",
    "the first - order nature of bg to vg transition , however , awaits convincing elucidation . in spite of advances in understanding and continuous updating of the vortex phase diagrams of a variety of type - ii superconductors",
    "@xcite , several issues still remained to be fully comprehended .",
    "one of these is the delineation between the smp and pe anomalies when they juxtapose , and the underlying physics represented by them .",
    "motivated by the aforesaid interesting features reported for a variety of superconductors , we have now investigated another low @xmath3 ( @xmath16k ) @xcite superconductor ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 , which belongs to the family of ternary stannides @xcite having cubic structure .",
    "this compound has attracted particular attention in recent years .",
    "for example , there have been evidences for nodeless superconductivity @xcite and a coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite ( attributed to ir 4d - band ) in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , studies related to vortex phase transformations in its superconducting mixed state have not been reported in this compound . in this work",
    ", we present a comparison of different outcomes of the ac and dc magnetization measurements performed in a weakly pinned ( ratio of depinning and depairing current densities is @xmath17 ) single crystal of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetization data reveal a very broad composite anomalous variation in @xmath12 which amounts to an order - disorder transformation in the vortex matter , however , the specific phase boundaries , pertaining to the order - disorder transformation , obtained from the ac and the dc measurement techniques are found to be significantly different .",
    "we can identify a certain region of the phase space where the ac field unexpectedly assists the transformation of the quasi - ordered bg into the partially disordered vg phase . in a different region of the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space ,",
    "the ac drive is seen to enhance the quality of spatial order of the underlying vortex matter , which inter alia is indicative of another order - disorder transition occurring in that portion of phase space , which gets exposed under the influence of an ac field .",
    "the two contrasting roles of the ac drive in different portions are attributed to the juxtaposition of the smp anomaly ( pinning induced ) and the peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon ( collapse of elasticity induced amorphization of the vortex matter ) .",
    "the unusual outcome of the imposition of an ac drive near the onset field of smp anomaly in the present report also corroborates a very recent finding @xcite in a different class of superconductor , ( i.e. , in ba@xmath18k@xmath18fe@xmath6as@xmath6 ) , wherein a large ac field ( @xmath19 oe ) lowers the onset field value of the anomalous change in @xmath8 at a given temperature , thereby elucidating the role of ac driving force in facilitating the spatial disordering of the vortex matter in a portion of the phase - space where the ordered state is metastable superheated state .",
    "the single crystals of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 were grown by tin flux method @xcite . the crystal chosen for the present study",
    "is platelet shaped , with a planar area of @xmath20mm@xmath21 and with thickness of @xmath22 mm , and mass of @xmath23 mg .",
    "the ac and dc magnetization measurements were performed in a superconducting quantum interference device - vibrating sample magnetometer ( squid - vsm , quantum design inc .",
    "the amplitude of the vibration in squid - vsm was kept small for all the dc magnetization measurements so as to avoid artifact that could arise from possible magnetic field inhomogeneity of a superconducting magnet along the length of sample movement .",
    "the ac magnetization measurements were performed by superimposing an oscillating magnetic field on various dc magnetic fields . the peak amplitude and the frequency of the driving ac field",

    "the @xmath26 response for @xmath34koe in the main panel of fig .",
    "1(a ) shows a much broader transition to the normal state depicting the monotonically decreasing value of @xmath26 as the temperature is increased .",
    "since @xmath31 is related to the critical current density , @xmath12 ( @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 is the amplitude of the ac drive and @xmath37 depends on the size and geometry of the sample ) , the fall in |@xmath26| reflects a decrease in @xmath12 with increasing temperature .",
    "however , the @xmath26 response for @xmath38koe shows an unusual deviation from the smooth monotonic decrease prior to the superconducting to normal transition , which in turn indicates a possible non - monotonic behavior of @xmath8 .",
    "this modulation in @xmath26 becomes more pronounced for @xmath28koe ( marked by arrow ) and for @xmath39koe , but the same characteristic could not be identified clearly at higher fields ( @xmath40koe ) . in order to bring out the interesting characteristics of this modulation , we now examine in fig .",

    "the first zero crossing in @xmath45 indicates the onset ( @xmath47 ) of the pe , whereas the second one marks the peak field ( @xmath48 ) of the pe . ]",
    "to further understand the details of the modulation in @xmath12 reflected in the isofield ac susceptibility measurements , we recorded isothermal ac susceptibility , @xmath44 , data as well , where the above discussed anomalous trend could be observed more clearly over a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath49k ) , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) ( @xmath44 values are normalized with respect to their saturated value at @xmath50 ) .",
    "the specimen was cooled in a nominal zero field down to a desired temperature and then the @xmath44 data were recorded while increasing the dc field .",
    "the @xmath44 response at each temperature initially decreases as the magnetic field is enhanced from zero field value , revealing the usual fall in @xmath14 with increasing field at a constant temperature .",
    "however , an anomalous dip in @xmath44 response can be seen at higher field values . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the onset field values of this dip gradually shift towards lower field values ( cf .",
    "2(a ) ) , reaching closer to the respective critical field values of superconducting - normal transition , which , in turn , suggests that the observed anomaly is akin to the well documented peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon @xcite . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show an expanded portion of @xmath44 response at @xmath46k , where the onset field ( @xmath47 ) of the peak effect like feature and the peak field ( @xmath48 ) of the pe are indicated by arrows .",
    "we further clarify the pe feature by plotting the derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath4 at @xmath46k in the same panel .",
    "the derivative curve ( @xmath45 ) in fig .",
    "2(b ) may appear on first examination to be analogous to the derivative plot @xmath51 at @xmath28koe ( cf .",
    "however , it is to be noted that the derivative of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath4 in fig .",
    "2(b ) has two zero crossings ; the first one is taken to imprint the onset of peak effect like anomaly ( @xmath47 ) and the second one identifies the peak position of the pe ( @xmath48 ) .    ) for dc field @xmath52koe , applied perpendicular as well as parallel to the plane of the platelet shaped crystal .",
    "the two orientations of the crystal ( relative to field ) are drawn in this panel .",
    "isothermal @xmath44 response ( normalized ) for these two orientations of the crystal at @xmath53k ( main panel ) and @xmath54k ( inset panel ) . ]      the sample geometry and demagnetization factor can affect the state of the spatial order of vortex matter in a given sample due to edge effects @xcite , which in turn could influence the triggering of the anomalous variation    @xmath4 scans ( first two quadrants ) recorded at different temperatures , as indicated .",
    "inset shows one typical @xmath55 curve recorded at @xmath32k with the two peaks occurring in @xmath55 curve marked as i and ii peak .",
    "( b ) expanded portions of the @xmath55 loops near an anomalous enhancement in hysteresis width ( @xmath56 ) obtained at different temperatures . the irreversibility field",
    "( @xmath57 ) and the upper critical field ( @xmath13 ) have been located in the @xmath55 curve at @xmath54k ( see inset ) . ]    in @xmath8 in isofield / isothermal scans .",
    "this motivated us to measure the ac susceptibility with field applied normal to the plane of the ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 sample .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3(a ) , a comparison of @xmath26 in the two different orientations : @xmath4 parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the sample .",
    "it is apparent that a deviation from the monotonically decreasing @xmath26 is present across nearly identical temperature intervals in both the orientations .",
    "the anomaly is also present in isothermal @xmath44 responses across similar field intervals for both the orientations ; typical curves are shown for @xmath53k ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) and @xmath54k ( an inset in fig .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the above stated features observed in the ac susceptibility are characteristic of the pinned vortex matter in the bulk of the ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystal .",
    "the anomalous peak feature is somewhat less prominent for @xmath4 perpendicular to the plane of the crystal , presumably due to the pinned vortex state being less spatially ordered prior to the pe in this orientation .",
    "the vortex phase boundaries determined from the characteristic features of the anomalous variation in @xmath8 are however found to be not significantly dependent on the demagnetization factor and the sample geometry .",
    "figure  4(a ) displays the first two quadrants of isothermal magnetization data , i.e. , @xmath58@xmath4 loops recorded at various temperatures , for field applied parallel to the plane of the platelet sample .",
    "the sample was first cooled in nominal zero field down to a desired temperature and the magnetization was recorded while ramping the field @xmath59 @xmath60oe / s well beyond the upper critical field , and then back to zero .",
    "figure  4(b ) presents the portions of @xmath58@xmath4 loops in the vicinity of an anomalous enhancement seen in the hysteresis width ( @xmath61 ) . as per a prescription of the beans critical state model @xcite ,",
    "the hysteresis width ( @xmath62 ) of the @xmath55 curve is roughly proportional to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the second magnetization peak feature @xcite observed in the @xmath55 curves ( fig .",
    "4 ) reflects an anomalous modulation in @xmath14 , which , in turn , could be indicative of an order - disorder transition in the vortex matter .",
    "the @xmath55 data show that the onset position ( marked as @xmath63 in fig .",
    "4(b ) ) of this anomaly is nearly temperature - independent in the range @xmath64k@xmath65@xmath5@xmath65@xmath24k ( shown by a dashed arrow line in fig .",
    "the onset field ( @xmath63 ) of the characteristic anomalous feature is located far away from the threshold field value ( @xmath13 ) of the superconducting - normal transition for @xmath66k , which is in contrast to the quintessential pe phenomenon typically located at the edge of the @xmath13 in very weakly pinned superconductors .",
    "the anomalous variation in @xmath14 located away from @xmath13 ( see inset in fig .",
    "4(b ) for location of @xmath13 at @xmath67k ) is termed as the smp anomaly .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "4(b ) also shows that the forward ( @xmath68 and reverse ( @xmath69 ) magnetization curves merge at a field identified as the irreversibility field , @xmath57 .",
    "figure  5(a ) illustrates a portion of the @xmath58@xmath4 curve at @xmath46k , wherein one can note a large field interval of reversible magnetization beyond @xmath57 .",
    "it could be argued that the linear extrapolation of the nearly reversible magnetization beyond @xmath57 to the @xmath70 axis would lead to an estimate of the upper critical field @xmath13 , in accordance with the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . however ,    @xmath4 curve at @xmath46k near the superconducting - normal transition .",
    "the @xmath58@xmath4 curve when linearly extrapolated ( dotted lines ) beyond @xmath57 , yields a characteristic field @xmath71 .",

    "5(a ) .    to further comprehend the behavior in @xmath55 response between @xmath57 and @xmath13",
    ", we now draw attention to the isofield dc magnetization @xmath79 data plotted in figs .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) .",
    "these two panels show the zero field - cooled ( @xmath73 ) and field - cooled warm - up ( @xmath74 ) magnetization responses at @xmath75koe ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) and @xmath76koe ( fig .",
    "the sample was cooled in nominal zero field down to @xmath80k , a field was applied and the magnetization was recorded while warming to obtain @xmath81 .",
    "the sample was then cooled from @xmath82 in the same field down to @xmath80k and the magnetization was recorded while warming , which is the @xmath83 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath81 and @xmath83 curves merge at a temperature , nominally marked as the irreversibility temperature @xmath77 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "5(b ) , where this temperature is marked for @xmath75koe ) .",
    "usually , a linear extrapolation of the ( equilibrium ) magnetization above @xmath77 to the @xmath70 axis is taken to identify the superconducting transition temperature @xmath84 .",
    "however , similar to the @xmath55 response near the superconducting transition ( cf .",
    "5(a ) ) , there exists a nearly reversible diamagnetic response persisting up to a higher temperature , which we have marked as the critical temperature , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the linear extrapolation of @xmath79 curve above @xmath77 to the @xmath70 has been identified with a characteristic temperature @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) in figs .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) .",
    "the results of both ac and dc magnetization measurements can finally be summarized by constructing a field - temperature ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) phase diagram for a given crystal of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "figure  6 illustrates this phase diagram depicting the various vortex phases separated by the boundaries / crossover regimes , as indicated .",
    "the phase boundary corresponding to the onset of the peak anomaly in @xmath14 ( @xmath47 ) , as extracted from the ac @xmath44 plots , lies significantly below than the onset of the smp ( @xmath63 ) line obtained from the dc @xmath55 curves .",
    "however , considering that both the smp and the pe anomalies signify order - disorder transformation(s ) in the vortex state , the region - i enclosed between the onset field values of the two anomalies , ( viz . between @xmath87 and @xmath88 lines in the main panel of fig .",
    "6 ) , is to be viewed as a well ordered vortex state via the dc @xmath55 measurements .",
    "the same field interval construes as a disordered region in view of the anomalous response observed in this region in the ac @xmath44 measurements . the superposed ac magnetic field in the @xmath89 measurements per se acts as an additional driving force on the pinned vortex matter .",
    "such a driving force is typically known to transform a metastable vortex configuration towards an equilibrium configuration in a given ( @xmath90 ) region @xcite by virtue of shaking the vortices around their mean locations .",
    "it is pertinent to recall here that from small angle neutron scattering measurements on the vortex matter in a weakly pinned crystal of nb , ling @xmath91 @xmath92 @xcite , had vividly shown that metastable disordered / ordered states possible below / above the onset of the pe boundary transform to their equilibrium ordered / disordered states in the respective ( @xmath90 ) regions on shaking with an ac drive . in this context , in the present situation in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 , the observation of disordered configuration ( region - i ) in the ac @xmath44 measurements below the onset position of the smp line is counter - intuitive .",
    "it would be more appropriate to state that the ordered state is an equilibrium state only below @xmath87 ( shown by thick line in fig .",
    "the ordered configuration observable in dc magnetization measurements between @xmath87 and @xmath88 can thus be identified with the notion of superheating of the bg phase above the @xmath93 line .",
    "the said superheated bg state transforms to its disordered version above the first order like @xmath93 line under the influence of an ac driving force in region - i .    in fig .  6 , it is instructive to note further that @xmath94 line lies above the @xmath95 line ( the latter obtained from forward legs of the @xmath55 curves , cf .",
    "if the ( @xmath90 ) region above @xmath95 line is to be viewed as an amorphous vortex matter , the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space ( i.e. , region ii ) bounded between @xmath95 and @xmath94 lines is such that an ac driving force is seen to improve the state of spatial order in the vortex matter in this region .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation in region - i .",
    "on the basis of effect of an ac drive in this region ( ii ) , one can also argue that the peak field of the smp ( @xmath96 ) marks the onset of another order - disorder transition ; such an inference is possible only by combining the outcomes of the influence of an ac drive with those obtained from @xmath55 data , where such a drive is not present .",
    "the amorphised state of the vortex matter as an equilibrium state thus emerges above the @xmath94 values ( thick line in fig .",
    "6 ) , instead of the usually presumed @xmath95 values ( dotted line in fig .",
    "6 ) , as marked from the dc @xmath58@xmath4 scans .",
    "it may be added here that the @xmath93 and @xmath97 lines are independent of frequency in the range @xmath98hz to @xmath99hz in which we repeated the ac susceptibility measurements in our set up .",
    "considering that the onset ( @xmath88 ) of smp is nearly temperature independent ( for @xmath100k ) and is located far below the @xmath13 line in fig .",
    "6 , we are lead to surmise that the @xmath4@xmath5 region between @xmath63 and @xmath96 as the multi - domain vortex glass ( vg ) state @xcite , in comparison to the assigned nomenclature of bragg glass ( bg ) to the vortex matter below the onset position of the anomalous variation in critical current density . in the absence of an ac drive , the bg extends up to @xmath88 line , whereas in the presence of a drive , bg state would get restricted up to @xmath87 line .",
    "we noted above that for @xmath100k , the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space between @xmath87 and @xmath94 lines can be subdivided notionally into three parts on the basis of effects of an ac drive on the underlying state of order in the vortex matter .",
    "above @xmath46k , we did not observe the fingerprint of smp anomaly in the dc @xmath58@xmath4 data .",
    "the ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) region in dotted rectangular box in fig .",
    "6 pertains to ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) phase space , where we observe only the pe anomaly in the ac @xmath101 data . in the boxed region",
    ", @xmath93 line continues to mark the bg to multi - domain vg transition and @xmath97 marks the amorphization of the vortex solid within the domains in response to the collapse of its elasticity . in this region ( @xmath102k and @xmath103koe@xmath104koe )",
    ", the @xmath97 line is in closer proximity of the irreversibility ( @xmath57,@xmath77 ) line .",
    "we recall that in a weakly - pinned conventional superconductors , where the pe phenomenon extends over a narrow ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) region and the irreversibility line lies in close proximity of the peak field / temperature of the pe , peak field of pe and/or the irreversibility line can be identified as the melting line .",
    "the vortex matter in between @xmath97 and @xmath105 is often termed to be pinned liquid . therefore , in the boxed region ( @xmath102k and @xmath103koe@xmath104koe ) , the @xmath105 could be accepted as the melting line . in ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) domain , where the peak field / temperature of the pe is located far away from the irreversibility line ( as in the interval @xmath100k and @xmath106koe ) , the vortex matter above the peak field of the smp / pe perhaps comprises an admixture of pinned liquid and amorphous solid phases .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now focus attention on to the reversible region bounded in between ( @xmath107 ) and ( @xmath108 ) lines in the main panel of fig .  6 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath13 enhances in a linear way as temperature decreases below the superconducting transition temperature of @xmath109k .",
    "the irreversibility line also displays linear variation below @xmath110k .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "6 shows that above @xmath111k , the irreversibility line has a long tail , which appears to terminate near @xmath112k as @xmath113 . in fig .  6 , we have also chosen to plot the ( @xmath114 ) data points obtained from linear extrapolation of the reversible magnetization response , they lie in between the irreversibility and the @xmath9 lines .",
    "it is instructive to note that @xmath78 runs parallel to the @xmath9 line and it also meet the @xmath115 axis at @xmath116k , distinct from the @xmath3 value of @xmath109k .",
    "if one asserts that the reversible magnetization represents an equilibrium magnetization response and concerns with the mean field description of a type - ii superconductor which predicts linear magnetization response , one may conclude that the superconducting - normal transition ought to terminate at @xmath117 , rather than its extension up to a higher field ( @xmath13)/higher temperature ( @xmath3 ) as apparent from the @xmath118 plots ( cf .",
    "fig .  5 ) .",
    "the deviation from the mean field description near the superconducting transition in the case of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 deserves a more detailed understanding .",
    "the recent observation of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite could be advanced as a rationale for these deviations , however , such a surmise may get discounted from the argument that the application of high fields ought to suppress the spin fluctuations , whereas in the present case , the separation between @xmath78 and @xmath9 lines actually enhances at larger field values as apparent from fig .  6 .",
    "to summarize , we have explored the vortex phase diagram in a weakly - pinned single crystal of a low @xmath3 superconductor , ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 , which is attracting adequate attention in the recent literature for its novel physics .",
    "table-1 contains various superconducting parameters evaluated ( at @xmath32k ) for ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 , using the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the weak pinning nature of this compound is reflected by the ratio of depinning and depairing current densities ( @xmath119 ) ~ 10@xmath120 .",
    "the smallness of this ratio may be attributed to the presence of point defects and metallurgical source @xcite of disorder in such compounds .",
    "the ac susceptibility ( @xmath89 ) measurements have revealed the occurrence of pe phenomenon in this compound . on the other hand , the results of dc magnetization measurements reflect features typically identified with the second magnetization peak anomaly .",
    "the phase boundaries constructed by both the ac as well as the dc data prompt us to identify the metastable regions in the vortex phase diagram of this compound .",
    "the region lying between the onset lines of the smp ( @xmath88 ) in dc data and the pe like phenomenon ( @xmath87 ) in the ac data is taken as a superheated ordered vortex matter , which sees an enhancement in spatial disordering under the influence of an ac field .",
    "in contrast to this , the region lying between the peak field of the pe ( @xmath48 ) and the smp ( @xmath96 ) anomalies exhibits enhancement in the ordering due to the effect of an ac drive .",
    "such an effect ceases at higher temperatures ( @xmath102k ) because of the absence of the smp feature there , only pe stands depicted at @xmath102k and for field values lying between @xmath121koe and@xmath122koe .",
    "the region of the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space over which the anomalous variation in @xmath14 predominates , is very broad and it bears resemblance with anomalous data in several other low @xmath3 as well as high @xmath3 superconductors , including the cuprates .",
    "the broad ( h , t ) region comprises per se two transitions , a bragg glass ( bg ) to vortex glass ( vg ) transition commencing at @xmath87 ( as in fig .  6 for ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 ) and the amorphization of the vortex matter commencing at @xmath95 ( as in fig .",
    "the @xmath94 line for ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 in fig .",
    "6 can be taken to mark the spinodal line of the second transition .",
    "the gap between @xmath96 and @xmath123 values progressively decreases as t approaches @xmath124k , and at @xmath121k , the said difference ceases to exist as the pe in the ac susceptibility subsumes the notion of smp .    in the end , we may point out that the vortex phase diagram ( fig .  6 ) of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 also raises an important issue regarding the source of diamagnetic response between @xmath117 and @xmath125 . as per the g - l theory , the expected upper critical field / temperature should have been the ( @xmath114 ) line in fig .  6 , the experimental values of the same are slightly enhanced to ( @xmath108 ) line .",
    "there is a significant separation between the two lines ( ( @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath108 ) ) even in an infinitesimally small field , as they intersect the temperature axis at @xmath116k and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "it is also pertinent to note that the g - l theory does not explicitly take into account the spatial ordering of the vortex matter .",
    "we have witnessed a reversible ( amorphous ) region ( in the dc @xmath118 response ) that emerged from the disordered configuration ( pe ) of the vortex matter , wherein ( i.e. , above ( @xmath114 ) line ) the mean field description does not hold .",
    "a possible source for such an unusual observation could be the existence of surface superconductivity @xcite above the @xmath117 line and surviving up to the @xmath125 line in the @xmath4@xmath5 phase space .",
    "efforts to explore this region of vortex phase diagram are currently in progress @xcite , with some significant success in sight .",
