    "the stability properties of the forced wake have been studied by @xcite using experimental measurements of the velocity field .",
    "they described in terms of the @xmath7 parameter space ( the frequency @xmath8 and the amplitude @xmath9 of the oscillations ) the two qualitatively different states that arise in the wake : a spatial mode dominated by the bvk vortex street , meaning that the wake is globally unstable ; and the so - called _ lock - in _ regime , where the frequency is imposed by the forcing in the near wake , the amplitude of the oscillation rapidly decaying downstream with the characteristics of a convective instability .",
    "+ the first goal of the present work is to refine the description of the transitions between the locked regime and the global instability , which have been described in previous works on this setup ( see @xcite for a review ) , especially for forcing frequencies lower than the natural frequency .",
    "particle image velocimetry ( piv ) measurements allow us to study the spatial development of the forced flow , in particular the modification of the global mode represented by the velocity fluctuation envelope . scaling laws in the forcing parameter space that universally describe the evolution of the global modes in the vicinity of the critical lines separating the lock - in and the globally unstable regions",

    "the appearance of a continuous spectrum for large forcing amplitudes was observed in two different situations with presumably two different physical explanations : for @xmath114 , the large forcing amplitude determines each vortex shed in the near wake to be very intense and thus to be destabilized , split and mix rapidly giving rise to a turbulence - like window in the parameter space .",
