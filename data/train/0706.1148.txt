    "the progress of semiconductor technology that took place in the 80s and 90s of the last century , in particular the rapid development of epitaxy and lithography techniques , has allowed physicists to manufacture and study structures in which carriers are confined to a small volume in space ( tens of nanometers or even less ) @xcite . in this way quantum dots ( qds ) , that is , artificial structures ( boxes ) containing a few particles with quantized energy levels , have been produced . because of the similarity to natural atoms , such structures are also referred to as artificial atoms .",
    "however , the properties of qds are more flexible in comparison with atoms : their shapes , size and various other features can be engineered at the stage of manufacturing by modifying the technological conditions and the number of confined electrons can be changed under laboratory conditions ( e.g. by applying an external voltage ) within a wide range of values .",
    "parallel to the laboratory investigations , a rapid process of miniaturization of commercial semiconductor structures ( e.g. , computer chips ) took place . at this moment , the state - of - the - art commercially available microchips , manufactured using the immersion photolithography technique , are built of elements whose size can be reduced down to the 90 nm diffraction limit . the introduction of the 45 nm process is announced for 2007 or early 2008 and the implementation of the 16 nm technology is envisaged in the time frame 2013 - 14 .",
    "thus , the characteristic size of elements in the microchips of our standard computer equipment has dropped below the size of the first qds obtained in laboratories 20 years ago and rapidly approaches the size of the smallest structures described in today s research papers .",
    "this progress of manufacturing technology is accompanied by a rapid development of optical spectroscopy .",
    "currently , it is possible to study the optical properties of a single qd and to coherently control the evolution of a single carrier or a pair of carriers ( electron - hole pair ) in such a structure .",
    "many experimental schemes of quantum optics have been implemented on qds . moreover ,",
    "certain procedures relying on the specific structure of the energy levels of these artificial semiconductor structures have been demonstrated , which have no counterpart in atomic systems .",
    "these experimental achievements have motivated theoretical proposals for sophisticated quantum - optical schemes that may lead , for instance , to optical control of a single electron spin in a qd .",
    "the goal of this chapter is twofold : first , to introduce the reader into the fascinating world of modern optical experiments on semiconductor quantum dots and to the astonishingly simple , yet nontrivial , theory underlying the phenomena observed in the labs on the fundamental , quantum - optical level .",
    "second , to give a review of some more sophisticated theoretical methods that allow one to include the interaction with the lattice vibration modes ( phonons ) which are specific to semiconductor systems .",
    "quantum dots are semiconductor structures in which the carrier dynamics is restricted in all three dimensions to the length scales of several or a few tens of nanometers @xcite .",
    "various structures that have this property may be obtained by a variety of methods .",
    "one of the most widely used techniques is the stransky - krastanov self - assembly .",
    "when a semiconductor compound is epitaxially ( layer by layer ) grown on a substrate with a different lattice constant ( the inas / gaas pair is a typical example ) each new layer must be squeezed to match the lattice constant of the substrate . at some point ( at about 1.7 monolayers for inas / gaas )",
    "it is energetically favorable for the epitaxial layers to restructurize into a system of islands , which increases the free surface but relaxes strain @xcite .",
    "the sample is then covered with the substrate material , leading to lens - shaped ( or , sometimes , pyramidal ) nanostructures as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]a @xcite . in general ,",
    "the band edges of the nanostructure material are offset with respect to those of the substrate .",
    "here we will only discuss structures as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]b - d , where the conduction band edge is shifted down and the valence band edge is shifted up , so that both electrons and holes are bound in the qd structure .",
    "another type of structures commonly used in the optical experiments are thickness fluctuations of a thin epitaxial layer of a semiconductor ( so called quantum well ) placed between thick structures of different semiconductor with a wider band gap . here , again , the band edge offset leads to localization of carriers within the quantum well layer . if the epitaxial growth of the quantum well layer has been stopped after the formation of a new monolayer started , the quantum well has one - monolayer thickness fluctuations which weakly localize the carriers .",
    "the qd nanostructures are typically 23 orders of magnitude larger than atoms",
    ". however , the effective mass of carriers in a semiconductor is often considerably lower than the free electron mass ( e.g. @xmath0 in gaas ) , and this degree of confinement is sufficient for quantization of carrier energies with electron inter - level spacing reaching 100 mev in self - assembled structures .",
    "this is definitely enough to resolve the states spectrally and to neglect thermal transitions to the excited states even at moderate temperatures .",
    "therefore , we will restrict the discussion to the ground state of each kind of carriers .",
    "the exact properties of the quantum states in a qd , e.g. , the geometry of wave functions or coulomb interaction between the confined carriers , may be found , e.g. , by tight - binding or pseudopotential calculations . for lens - shaped qds , a simple 2-dimensional harmonic model @xcite has been shown to be a very good approximation @xcite . the states of an interacting few - particle system may then be found by numerical configuration ",
    "interaction techniques @xcite . however , these details are irrelevant for the discussion on the general quantum - optical level .",
    "whenever a specific model is necessary ( secs .",
    "[ sec : phonons ] and [ sec : kinet ] ) we will use simple gaussian wave functions . also in these cases , the results do not depend essentially on this choice .",
    "even with the restriction to the lowest orbital states , the structure of energy levels and allowed optical transitions in a qd becomes quite complicated if the angular momenta of carriers are taken into account . the valence band in iii - v semiconductors is composed of p - type atomic orbitals ( orbital angular momentum @xmath1 ) , yielding six quantum states ( taking spin into account ) for each quasi - momentum @xmath2 .",
    "due to considerable spin - orbit coupling the orbital angular momentum and spin are not separate good quantum numbers and the valence band states of a bulk crystal must be classified by the total angular momentum and its projection on a selected axis .",
    "thus , the valence band is composed of three sub - bands corresponding to two different representations of the total angular momentum @xmath3 . out of these , the two states with @xmath4 form a subband which is split - off by the spin ",
    "orbit interaction .",
    "the other four states with @xmath5 are degenerate in a bulk crystal at @xmath6 but this degeneracy is lifted by size quantization and strain in a qd structure , with the heavy hole ( hh ) subband ( angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis ( @xmath7 ) lying above the light hole ( lh ) subband ( @xmath8 ) in all known structures .",
    "the fundamental optical excitation of a qd consists in transferring optically an electron from the highest confined state in the valence band ( thus leaving a hole ) to the lowest confined state in the conduction band .",
    "the interacting electron ",
    "hole pair created in this way is referred to as exciton ( lh - exciton or hh - exciton , depending on the kind of a hole involved ) .",
    "angular momentum selection rules restrict the transitions allowed for a given propagation direction and polarization of the light beam , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules ] .",
    "for instance , according to the selection rules represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]b , a right circularly polarized ( @xmath9-polarized ) laser beam can only create an exciton with total momentum + 1 , referred to as `` @xmath9 exciton '' , in accordance with the angular momentum conservation ( removing an electron with the angular momentum m is equivalent to the creation of a hole with the angular momentum @xmath10 ) .",
    "similarly , a @xmath11-polarized ( left circularly polarized ) beam creates only a `` @xmath11 exciton '' with the angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "although there are still two transitions allowed for a given circular polarization they can easily be distinguished since the lh states are well separated energetically from the lowest hh states .    in appropriately doped structures , qds in the ground state of the system may be occupied by electrons .",
    "an optical excitation in this case corresponds to a transition between a single electron state and a negative trion state , i.e. , the state of two electrons and one hole confined in a qd . from the pauli exclusion principle it is clear that this transition is possible only if the state which is to be occupied by the photo - created electron is free .",
    "hence , in the situation of fig .",
    "1b , a heavy hole trion may be created if the dot is initially occupied by a `` spin up '' ( @xmath13 ) electron but not if the electron in the dot is in the `` spin down '' ( @xmath14 ) state .",
    "this suppression of the optical transition depending on the spin of the electron in the qd is referred to as pauli blocking and has been indeed observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "after exciting an electron from the heavy hole band with a @xmath9-polarized laser beam ( @xmath15 ) , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]b , it is still possible to transfer also the @xmath16 electron to the @xmath13 conduction band state using @xmath11-polarized light ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]c ) .",
    "thus , if the optical processes are spectrally restricted to heavy holes ( as is the case in most experiments ) there are four optically active states linked by allowed optical transitions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : biex - diagram]a .",
    "the highest state , with two electrons and two holes present in the qd , is treated as composed of two electron - hole pairs and is called a biexciton .",
    "the coulomb ( dipole - dipole ) interaction between the two excitons shifts the energy of the biexciton state@xcite by the binding energy @xmath17 , so that the exciton  biexciton transitions are non - degenerate with the ground state  exciton transitions . in this way , all four transitions in the diagram can be distinguished either spectrally or by polarizations .      the recent progress in ultrafast spectroscopy of semiconductor systems",
    "@xcite made it possible to control and probe the quantum states of carriers confined in a qd on femtosecond time scales .",
    "in particular , high degree of control over carrier occupations in various kinds of qd structures has been demonstrated .",
    "one kind of an experiment consists in measuring the average occupation of the qd after a pulse of fixed length but variable amplitude .",
    "the qd occupation is defined as the probability of finding an exciton in the qd after the laser pulse , calculated as the fraction of cases in which an exciton was created over a large number of repetitions of the experiment . within the linear absorption theory",
    ", the excitation ( the qd occupation ) grows proportionally to the pulse intensity .",
    "obviously , this growth can not be unlimited . when the occupation of the excited level is sufficiently large the spontaneous and induced emission processes suppress further increase of the occupation . here",
    ", we are interested in the coherent limit , where the evolution is induced by a strong ( essentially classical ) laser field , inducing large occupation changes over time scales much shorter than the spontaneous emission time . then , the system is driven from the ground to the excited state in a coherent way , and than back to the ground state via a coherently induced emission process . as a result ,",
    "in an ideal case , the final occupation after a pulse should show sinusoidal oscillations between 0 and 1 as a function of the square root of pulse intensity ( referred to as _ pulse area _ ",
    "see sec.[sec : two - level - rabi ] ) .",
    "such oscillations , known as pulse area dependent rabi oscillations , have been indeed observed in a range of experiments on single qds @xcite .",
    "similar effect can also be observed in ensembles of qds @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]a we show the results of such an experiment , performed with a single qd - based photodiode structure @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the qd is placed in an electric field between a pair of electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]c ) . each electron - hole pair generated by",
    "the optical excitation contributes to the photocurrent in the structure .",
    "if the laser pulse repetition rate is @xmath18 ( typically in khz  mhz range ) and the average qd occupation for a given pulse area is @xmath19 , then the repeated pulsing results in a current @xmath20 . in this way , the rabi oscillations of the average exciton number are reflected in the oscillating form of the photocurrent as a function of the pulse area , which provides a means of detection much more efficient than optical ones .",
    "these oscillations are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]a , although some damping , due to dephasing , is also visible .",
    "apart from the coherent control of exciton occupations , it has also been shown that phase control of carrier states in qds is possible . a laser pulse detuned from the exciton resonance",
    "can not induce real transitions and , therefore , does not change occupations . nonetheless , as shown in an optical experiment with interface fluctuation qds @xcite",
    ", it can shift the energy levels via the ac ( optical ) stark effect and affect the phases in a quantum superposition of empty dot and single - exciton states .",
    "another way to control the phases is to drive the system with a slightly detuned laser pulse , which leads to a combination of occupation and phase evolution @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : two - level - rabi ] ) . in this case ,",
    "phase effects can be observed in the form of ramsey interference fringes @xcite .",
    "it is possible to see in an experiment that the quantum state of an electron - hole pair in a qd maintains its phase coherence long after the laser pulse has been switched off . to this end ,",
    "one splits the pulse into two parts . if the phase of the quantum state in the qd were random when the second pulse arrives the phase of the latter would be irrelevant . on the contrary , in the experiment one observes oscillations of the final qd occupation as a function of the relative phase shift between the two pulses @xcite ( the phase is shifted by tuning the delay between the pulses with a sub - femtosecond accuracy , that is , by a fraction of the optical oscillation period ) .",
    "such an effect is referred to as time - domain interference , since it may be interpreted in terms of interference between the probability amplitudes for exciting the qd with the first or with the second pulse .",
    "a formal treatment of this class of experiments will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec:2level - interf ] .",
    "apart from the fact that such interference experiments demonstrate coherent phase - sensitive quantum control with an amazingly precise timing , they are also of interest from a more general point of view . obviously , in spite of the wave - like behavior manifested by the interference effect , a single measurement of the qd occupation always yields either 0 or 1 , demonstrating the particle - like nature of the exciton .",
    "thus , the time - domain interference experiments on qds demonstrate quantum complementarity between the particle - like nature of an exciton and its ability to show quantum interference @xcite .",
    "controlling a single quantum degree of freedom ( an exciton ) is just the first step towards large - scale nano - optoelectronic and quantum computing applications .",
    "the next step towards more complex implementations is to include coupling between two or more individual quantum subsystems .",
    "the simplest experimental realization of such a composite system is a biexciton . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : qd ] , due to the coulomb interaction between the two excitons , the excitation energy of an exciton in the presence of the other one is different than in its absence .",
    "thus , these two transitions can be addressed individually .",
    "together with the polarization dependence of the allowed transitions ( selection rules , see sec .",
    "[ sec : qd ] ) , this allows one to excite , say , the @xmath9 exciton if and only if the the @xmath11 exciton is present .",
    "such a conditional control procedure was indeed performed in an experiment @xcite , where rabi oscillations on the exciton  biexciton transition were demonstrated . if the two excitons are viewed as quantum bits ( with 0 and 1 corresponding to their presence or absence in the qd ) then such a conditional excitation constitutes an implementation of the controlled - not gate which is fundamental for quantum commuting @xcite .",
    "such a controlled - not gate was indeed implemented experimentally in a qd system @xcite . in a similar way it is possible to coherently manipulate a biexciton system in two coupled qds ( with one exciton localized in each dot ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens if the frequency @xmath21 of a linearly polarized laser beam is chosen such that the energy of two photons matches the biexciton energy , @xmath22 , while the single - exciton transitions are detuned by @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : biex - diagram]b ) .",
    "a linearly polarized pulse is a superposition of two circularly polarized components , so that both exciton transitions are allowed by the selection rules but neither of them satisfies the energy conservation .",
    "perturbation theory would predict that the occupation of the biexciton state should grow proportionally to the square of the pulse intensity ( that is , to the 4th power of the pulse area ) , as a result of a two - photon absorption process .",
    "experimental results @xcite presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]b indeed show such a behavior for low pulse intensities .",
    "however , beyond this perturbative regime , a pattern of two - photon pulse area dependent rabi oscillations between the ground and biexciton states develops , which become almost periodic for large pulse intensities .",
    "the theory of such coherent phenomena in the biexciton system will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : biex ] .",
    "let us now proceed to a theoretical description of the quantum evolution of carriers confined in a qd and subject to a laser field .",
    "we will start with the simplest situation when the qd is driven by a circularly polarized laser beam ( say , @xmath9 ) tuned to the fundamental heavy hole transition , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sel - rules]a ( vertical arrow ) .",
    "then , only two states are involved in the evolution : the ground state ( empty dot ) , denoted by @xmath24 , and the @xmath9 exciton state , denoted @xmath25 ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : biex - diagram]a ) .",
    "therefore , one effectively deals with a very simple two - level system .",
    "the discussion of such systems is made particularly transparent by introducing the concept of the bloch sphere ( actually , a ball ) .",
    "the state ( pure or mixed ) of such a system is represented by a density matrix : a @xmath26 , hermitian , and positive definite operator with unit trace .",
    "any such operator can be written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a real three - dimensional vector with @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the unit operator , and @xmath31 is the vector of pauli matrices in the basis @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the state of a two - level system is represented in a unique way by a unit ball in a three - dimensional real space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch ] ) . since @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ,",
    "one finds @xmath36 , so that pure states ( represented by projectors ) correspond to unit vectors @xmath28 and are mapped to the surface of the ball .",
    "it is easy to see that the point with spherical coordinates @xmath37 represents the state vector @xmath38 .",
    "the electric field of the laser beam is conveniently written as @xmath39 , where @xmath21 is the frequency of the light , @xmath40 is the phase of the pulse and @xmath41 is the envelope of the pulse , varying slowly compared to the oscillations of the optical field .",
    "the state of the system @xmath42 evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath43 with the hamiltonian @xmath44   \\left ( \\mu |0\\rangle\\!\\langle 1|+\\mu^ { * } |1\\rangle\\!\\langle 0| \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the energy of the interband transition in the qd , @xmath46 is the off - diagonal ( interband ) matrix element of the electric dipole moment ( between the two relevant states ) , and we allow the pulse to arrive at an arbitrary time @xmath47 . by a proper choice of the phase of the state @xmath25 it is possible to have @xmath46 real , which will be assumed in the following .",
    "we will use the shorthand notation @xmath48 .    in the absence of the driving",
    ", the phase of the state @xmath25 rotates with the frequency @xmath49 which is of the order of fs@xmath50 .",
    "one gets rid of this trivial fast dynamics by describing the system in the frame rotating with the same frequency .",
    "this is similar to a transition to the interaction picture except that , for practical reasons , it is convenient to perform the transformation with the laser frequency @xmath21 instead of the system frequency @xmath49 ( these two frequencies are close to each other ) .",
    "thus , we perform the transformation @xmath51 using eq .",
    "( [ schroed ] ) one easily finds the evolution equation for the redefined states in the form @xmath52 , with the hamiltonian @xmath53 is the detuning of the laser beam from the transition energy .",
    "the next essential step is to note that the natural frequency scale of the system evolution is set by the detuning @xmath54 and by the pulse amplitude @xmath55 and is many orders of magnitude smaller than the optical frequency @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the quickly oscillating terms ( @xmath56 ) are strongly off - resonant and will have very little impact on the system evolution .",
    "therefore , they can be neglected , which leads to the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "one obtains the following rwa hamiltonian @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "let us start with applying the formalism to the rabi oscillations described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "first , assume that the pulse is resonant with the optical transition in the qd , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "in this case , the evolution operator generated by the rwa hamiltonian ( [ ham-2level - rwa ] ) can be found analytically .",
    "indeed , in the resonant case the hamiltonians at different times commute with one another , so that the evolution operator may be written as @xmath60   = \\cos\\frac{\\phi(t)}{2}\\mathbb{i}-i\\sin\\frac{\\phi(t)}{2 } \\hat{\\bm{u}}\\cdot\\bm{\\sigma},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the initial time of the evolution , and the last identity is easily proven by expanding the exponent in a series and collecting the odd- and even - order terms using the identities @xmath63 and @xmath64 for any natural number @xmath65 .",
    "we will always assume that this time is before any pulses were switched on , so that one can set @xmath66 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is called the pulse area and determines the unitary transformation of the system state performed by the complete pulse .",
    "one speaks of @xmath68-pulses , @xmath69 pulses etc . , referring to the value of the pulse area .",
    "starting from the ground system state @xmath24 one obtains , after switching the pulse off , @xmath70 the occupation of the state @xmath25 is , therefore , @xmath71 and indeed oscillates between 0 and 1 as a function of the pulse area @xmath72 .",
    "the final system states for a set of values of @xmath72 in this resonant case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]a .",
    "let us note here that the final state is determined by a simple function of just one quantity , the pulse area , and is independent of any details of the pulse shape .",
    "this fact is known as the area theorem .    off resonance ( for @xmath73 ) , the evolution can be found in a closed analytical form only for rectangular pulse envelopes @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "instead of performing this simple exercise , let us look at the evolution for a family of gaussian pulses @xmath74 obtained by ( also very simple ) numerical integration of the schrdinger equation  ( [ schroed ] ) , shown in fig .  [ fig : rabi]b ( see also ref .  ) . in the detuned case , the system does not reach the @xmath25 state .",
    "instead , the state is rotated around a tilted axis and the final state does not show periodicity as a function of the pulse area .",
    "the difference between the resonant and non - resonant case is also visible in the dependence of the final occupation of the state @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi]c ) .",
    "another experiment that can easily be explained based on the two level model is that of time domain interference . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] , such experiments are performed with two laser pulses selectively tuned to the exact resonance with one of the two fundamental optical transitions .",
    "the pulses are generated by splitting a single laser pulse and delaying one part with respect to the other . in this way , the two pulses are phase - locked , i.e. , their relative phase is definite and determined by the delay time @xmath75 .",
    "the first pulse arrives at @xmath76 and prepares the initial superposition state . in a usual two - slit ( space - domain )",

    "the second pulse arrives at @xmath77 .",
    "this pulse plays the role of `` beam merger '' providing , at the same time , a phase shift between the `` paths '' .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system driven by the two pulses is obtained by an obvious generalization of eq .",

    "after this pulse , the average number of excitons in the dot is @xmath85 and changes periodically between @xmath86 and @xmath87 as a function of the delay time @xmath75 , thus producing an interference pattern .",

    "otherwise , some _ a priori _ information on the superposition state can be inferred and the visibility is reduced .",
    "reduction of visibility occurs also if some information on the system state between the pulses ( analogous to _ which way _ information ) has been extracted either intentionally , in a controlled experiment ( see sec.[sec : biex - complem ] ) , or as a result of uncontrolled dephasing @xcite .      the quantum control of a two - level system formed by the ground state and a single exciton exploits only small part of the possibilities offered by a qd .",
    "much more interesting physics , as well as potential applications , becomes available if all the states are involved in the dynamics .",

    "first , the theory of the experimentally observed two - photon rabi oscillations is given @xcite .",
    "then , a theoretical proposal for an experiment highlighting the role of quantum complementarity in time - domain interference is described @xcite .      if we apply circularly polarized excitation to a qd in the ground state we can only create single excitons , as follows from the selection rules discussed in sec .",

    "( [ delta - detal ] ) , the average error may now be written as @xmath290    the averaging is most conveniently performed by noting that @xmath291 where @xmath292 .",
    "choosing @xmath293 , @xmath294 , one gets @xmath295 which , upon averaging over the angles @xmath296 on the bloch sphere , leads to @xmath297    let us now consider a gaussian pulse for performing the quantum gate , @xmath298      e^{-\\frac{1}{2 } ( { t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{p } } } ) ^2}$ ] , were @xmath299 is the gate duration , while @xmath72 is the angle determining the rotation .",
    "the function @xmath300 that carries all the needed information about spectral properties of the system s dynamics may be approximately written as @xmath301    as may be seen from ( [ delta - av ] ) and ( [ fpm ] ) , for a spectral density @xmath302 the error scales with the gate duration as @xmath303 and @xmath304 at low and high temperatures , respectively .",
    "therefore , for @xmath305 ( typical for various types of phonon reservoirs ) the error grows for faster gates . assuming the spectral density of the form @xmath306 for low frequencies ( as for the deformation potential coupling at low temperatures ) , we obtain from ( [ delta - av ] ) and ( [ fpm ] ) @xmath307 this leading order formula holds for @xmath308 .",
    "also , if we introduce the upper cut - off , the error will be finite even for an infinitely fast gate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] ) ; this is the ultrafast limit discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : ultrafast ] .",
    "thus , the phonon - induced error indeed decreases for slow driving .",
    "this could result in obtaining arbitrarily low error by choosing a suitably low gate speed .",
    "however , if the system is also subject to other types of noise this becomes impossible @xcite .",
    "indeed , assuming an additional contribution growing with rate @xmath309 , the total error per gate is @xmath310 where @xmath311 is the characteristic time of markovian decoherence ( recombination time in the excitonic case ) . as a result ,",
    "the overall error is unavoidable and optimization is needed",
    ". the formulas ( [ error - simple ] ) lead to the optimal values of the form ( for @xmath312 ) @xmath313    for the specific material parameters of gaas , the optimal gate time and minimal decoherence resulting from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : minerror ] ) are @xmath314 the exact solution within the proposed model , taking into account the cut - off and anisotropy ( flat shape ) of the dot and allowing finite temperatures , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] .",
    "the size - dependent cut - off is reflected by a shift of the optimal parameters for the two dot sizes : larger dots allow faster gates and lead to lower error .",
    "it should be noted that these optimal times are longer than the limits imposed by level separation @xcite .",
    "thus , the non - markovian reservoir effects ( dressing ) seem to be the essential limitation to the gate speed . on the other hand , in the above discussion we used simple gaussian pulses and a straightforward way of encoding the qubit .",
    "the error resulting from the phonon dynamics may be reduced by optimizing the shape of the control pulse @xcite or by encoding the qubit into a state of an array of qds @xcite .",
    "the correlation expansion technique is a standard method used for the description of quantum kinetics of interacting carriers and phonons in semiconductor systems of any dimensionality @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to carrier - phonon kinetics in quantum dots driven by an optical field , beyond the instantaneous excitation limit described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ultrafast ] and beyond the weak perturbation case which allows a perturbative treatment ( sec .",
    "[ sec : perturb ] ) @xcite . compared to higher - dimensional systems , in quantum dots coherent and non - equilibrium phonons play a larger role because of the localized polaron effect .",
    "therefore , a reliable description of the carrier phonon - kinetics in these systems requires a high enough degree of the correlation - expansion technique @xcite .",
    "various implementations of this technique differ in notation and in the choice of dynamical variables . here",
    ", let us start from the three dynamical variables @xmath315 describing the carrier state , @xmath316 , where @xmath317 are pauli operators , written in the @xmath32 basis , in the heisenberg picture .",
    "these three variables are the coordinates of the evolving bloch vector , uniquely determining the reduced density matrix of the carrier subsystem according to eq .",
    "( [ blochrep ] ) .    from the heisenberg equations of motion one finds the dynamical equations for these three variables , @xmath318\\rangle = -\\delta y-4y\\sum_{\\bm{k}}\\mathrm{re}\\ ,   b_{\\bm{k}}-4y\\sum_{\\bm{k}}\\mathrm{re}\\ , y_{\\bm{k}},\\ ] ] and analogous for @xmath319 and @xmath180 ( from now on , the time dependence will not be written explicitly ) .",
    "obviously , this set of equations is not closed , but involves new the phonon variables @xmath320 , as well as phonon - assisted variables of the form @xmath321 .",
    "the double angular brackets , @xmath322 , denote the correlated part of a product of operators , obtained by subtracting all possible factorizations of the product .",
    "next , one writes down the equations of motion for the new variables that appeared in the previous step , for instance , @xmath323\\rangle = \\delta x_{\\bm{k}}-2vz_{\\bm{k}}-i\\omega_{\\bm{k } } y_{\\bm{k } } + |g_{\\bm{k}}|^{2}(iyz+x)\\\\ \\nonumber & & + 2\\sum_{\\bm{q } } ( x_{\\bm{q}\\bm{k}}+\\tilde{x}_{\\bm{q}\\bm{k } } ) + 4x_{\\bm{k}}\\sum_{\\bm{q}}\\mathrm{re}\\ , b_{\\bm{q } } + 2x\\sum_{\\bm{q } } ( b_{\\bm{q}\\bm{k}}+\\tilde{b}_{\\bm{q}\\bm{k}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the new two - phonon and two - phonon - assisted variables are defined as @xmath324 , @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 , etc . in the next step ,",
    "one writes the equation of motion for these new variables , introducing three - phonon variables .",
    "it is clear that the resulting hierarchy of equations in infinite and has to be truncated at a certain level .",
    "here we do this by setting all the correlated parts of the three - phonon and three - phonon assisted variables equal to zero .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the correlations involving three or more phonons or , physically , to neglecting three - phonon processes ( that is , emission or absorption of three or more phonons within the memory time of the phonon reservoir , which is of order of 1 ps ) .",
    "the motivation for this procedure is that higher order correlations should play a decreasing role in the dynamics . from the equations of motion it is also clear that such higher order correlations develop in higher orders with respect to the coupling constants @xmath189 .    as an example of an application of this technique , fig .",

    ". an interesting feature of this result is that the quality of oscillations decreases for moderate pulse durations but then increases again for longer pulses .",
    "this can be understood ( using the perturbative approach of sec .",
    "[ sec : perturb ] ) in terms of a resonance between the oscillations of the charge distribution and the phonon modes @xcite .",
    "this chapter presented an overview of some recent results related to optical control and decoherence of carriers in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "the problems discussed here are of interest not only from the scientific point of view but are also important for possible applications of nanostructure - based devices in the field of nano - electronics , optoelectronics and spintronics @xcite .",
    "obviously , a chapter of limited length can not give an exhaustive review of this broad and rapidly developing field .",
    "consequently , the goal of the present review was rather to give an introduction to the field rather than a complete , encyclopedic account of all the achievements .",
    "in particular , the two level ( or few - level ) model on which the presented discussion was based , is obviously merely an approximation to the complex semiconductor system . in fact",
    ", any interaction of the confined carriers with the external driving fields not only leads to the desired quantum transitions but also can induce some unwanted ones . if both the desired and unwanted transitions have a discrete nature ( e.g. , the exciton vs. biexciton transition in a qd ) the latter may be suppressed by a suitable choice of control pulses @xcite",

    "the capability of encoding and manipulating information at the single - spin level is of great importance for spintronic and quantum information processing applications .",
    "recent experimental progress includes the generation @xcite and optical control @xcite of the spin coherence together with a possible read - out of the state of a single confined spin in a qd system @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that spin states in qds may be prepared with high fidelity ( exceeding 99.8% ) by optical coupling of electronic spin states .",
    "this was done by resonant excitation of the trion transition in the presence of small heavy - light hole mixing @xcite .",
    "corresponding to these achievements , a range of schemes for optical spin control has been proposed theoretically @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on quantum - optical procedures , exploiting the structure of selection rules in a qd discussed in this chapter . in particular ,",
    "the spin rotation is performed by coupling af a single electron state to a trion state . since the spin control is achieved by means of spin - dependent charge evolution these procedures result in phonon - induced dephasing that may be described using the methods described here @xcite .",
