    "the purpose of this report is to outline the main results of a series of forthcoming papers by the author .",
    "the first three of these @xcite , @xcite , @xcite lay the groundwork for  topological index @xmath1 \" surfaces . the final paper in the series @xcite will replace the present one , and uses this technology to establish the results described below .",
    "given a heegaard surface @xmath2 in a 3-manifold , @xmath3 , one can _ stabilize _ to obtain a splitting of higher genus by taking the connected sum of @xmath2 with the genus one splitting of @xmath4 .",
    "suppose @xmath5 and @xmath6 are heegaard splittings of @xmath3 , where @xmath7 .",
    "it is a classical result of reidemeister @xcite and singer @xcite from 1933 that as long as @xmath5 and @xmath6 induce the same partition of the components of @xmath8 , stabilizing @xmath5 some number of times produces a stabilization of @xmath6 .",
    "just one stabilization was proved to always be sufficient in large classes of 3-manifolds , including seifert fibered spaces @xcite , genus two 3-manifolds @xcite , and most graph manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of examples to the contrary has led to  the stabilization conjecture \" : any pair of heegaard splittings requires at most one stabilization to become equivalent .",
    "( see conjecture 7.4 in @xcite . )    in this announcement we outline our program to construct families of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture .",
    "this work , however , is broader than just the stabilization conjecture .",
    "the techniques developed to produce these examples also lead to the resolution of several other important questions in 3-manifold topology , as detailed below .",
    "this work was announced in december of 2007 at a workshop on _ triangulations , heegaard splittings , and hyperbolic geometry _",
    ", at the american institute of mathematics .",
    "at the same conference another family of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture was announced by hass , thompson , and thurston , and their preprint has since appeared on the arxiv @xcite .",
    "their proof uses mainly geometric techniques .",
    "several months later johnson posted a preprint on the arxiv @xcite that claims to be a combinatorial version of their paper .",
    "our main family of counter - examples is described by the following theorem :    [ t : mainfamily ] for each @xmath9 there is a closed 3-manifold which has a pair of inequivalent ( unoriented ) heegaard splittings of genus @xmath1 which must be stabilized at least @xmath10 times to become equivalent .",
    "the pairs of splittings obtained by hass , thompson , and thurston are isotopic , as unoriented surfaces . when the manifold has boundary oriented and unoriented isotopy classes are the same .",
    "johnson uses this fact to produce unoriented counter - examples .",
    "in fact , when there is boundary present our construction is easier as well , and is outlined in section [ s : program ] below . this sketch is representative of the techniques used to establish all of the results claimed here .",
    "given an analogous result about connected sums ( see @xcite ) , it is natural to conjecture that amalgamations of unstabilized heegaard splittings are unstabilized .",
    "that is , if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are glued along a surface @xmath13 of non - zero genus , and @xmath14 is an unstabilized heegaard surface in @xmath15 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be amalgamated in @xmath16 to an unstabilized heegaard surface .",
    "unfortunately , even if the genus of @xmath13 is one , then schultens and weidmann have shown this to be false @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps surprising , then , that we are able to establish the following :    [ t : highgenusgordon ] let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote irreducible , orientable , anannular 3-manifolds with incompressible , homeomorphic boundary .",
    "let @xmath3 be the 3-manifold obtained from @xmath11 and @xmath12 by gluing their boundaries by some  sufficiently complicated \" homeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath14 be an unstabilized , boundary - unstabilized heegaard surface in @xmath15 of low genus .",
    "then the amalgamation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath3 is unstabilized .",
    "just how low  low genus \" is depends on how complicated the gluing map between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is , unless @xmath17 . in this latter case the words",
    " low genus \" may be removed from the statement of the theorem .    as a corollary to this result",
    "we construct an example whose existence has been conjectured by yoav moriah : a non - minimal genus heegaard splitting which has hempel distance @xcite exactly one .",
    "moriah has called the search for such examples the  nemesis of heegaard splittings \" @xcite .",
    "in fact , we go further and produce a single manifold that has such splittings of arbitrarily high genus :    there exists a closed 3-manifold that contains non - minimal genus , unstabilized heegaard splittings which are not strongly irreducible , of arbitrarily high genus .",
    "let @xmath3 denote a 3-manifold with torus boundary , and strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of arbitrarily high genus .",
    "such an example has been constructed by casson and gordon .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "now let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be two copies of @xmath3 , and let @xmath18 denote a genus @xmath0 strongly irreducible splitting in @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath18 is strongly irreducible , it is neither stabilized nor boundary - stabilized .",
    "hence , if @xmath11 is glued to @xmath12 by a sufficiently complicated homeomorphism , it follows from theorem [ t : highgenusgordon ] that the amalgamation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is unstabilized . finally , note that every amalgamation is weakly reducible .    finally , we prove the following theorem , which is also analogous to a result about connected sums established by the author in @xcite .    [",
    "t : highgenusgordonisotopy ] let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote irreducible , orientable , anannular 3-manifolds with incompressible , homeomorphic boundary .",
    "let @xmath3 be the 3-manifold obtained from @xmath11 and @xmath12 by gluing their boundaries by some  sufficiently complicated \" homeomorphism .",
    "then every  low genus \" heegaard splitting of @xmath3 has a expression as the amalgamation of splittings of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "again , the words  low genus \" in the statement of this theorem can be removed if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are being glued along a torus .",
    "theorems [ t : highgenusgordon ] and [ t : highgenusgordonisotopy ] together complete our picture of the  low genus \" heegaard splittings of a 3-manifold constructed by gluing two manifolds @xmath11 and @xmath12 together by a  sufficiently complicated \" map .",
    "every unstabilized , low genus heegard splitting of @xmath21 is an amalgamation of  component \" unstabilized splittings of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "two such splittings are isotopic if and only if their component splittings are isotopic .",
    "hence , the unstabilized splittings of @xmath21 are completely determined by the unstabilized splittings of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a necessary step in the proofs of the above results is to put various classes of surfaces in some kind of  normal form \" with respect to a triangulation .",
    "we believe these results are of independent interest .",
    "two common classes of surfaces that have proved useful in 3-manifold topology are the _",
    "incompressible _ and _ strongly irreducible _",
    "@xcite ones . in @xcite",
    "the author introduced a third class , called _",
    "critical surfaces_. these were used by the author in @xcite to prove a conjecture of gordon .",
    "each of these categories is defined by a combinatorial condition on the set of compressing disks for the surface .    following the work of kneser @xcite , haken proved that incompressible surfaces can be put into a nice form with respect to any triangulation @xcite .",
    "such surfaces were called _",
    "normal _ , and intersect each tetrahedron in a collection of triangles and quadrilaterals .",
    "rubinstein pushed this work further by proving that strongly irreducible heegaard splittings can be isotoped to be _ almost normal _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such surfaces look normal everywhere , with the exception of one piece in a single tetrahedron .",
    "this exceptional piece is either an octagon , or two normal disks connected by an unknotted tube .",
    "we call this piece the _ almost normal exception_.    in @xcite the author extended rubinstein s result to strongly irreducible surfaces that have non - empty boundary ( see also @xcite ) . for this work ,",
    "a third type of almost normal exception was introduced , which looks like two normal disks connected by a band along @xmath22 .",
    "similar results have been obtained by wilson @xcite and coward @xcite .    to prove the theorems listed above it was necessary to find a similar normal form for critical surfaces ( possibly with non - empty boundary ) .",
    "the precise result is :    [ t : criticalnormal ] given a fixed triangulation , any critical surface ( with or without boundary ) is isotopic to one which looks normal everywhere , except for exactly one 12-gon or two almost normal exceptions .",
    "this theorem , as well as new proofs of the normalization results mentioned before it , will appear in @xcite .",
    "a technical result that will be of interest to the experts is that when two boundary components of a ( possibly disconnected ) 3-manifold are glued by a  sufficiently complicated \" map the gluing surface in the resulting 3-manifold acts as a barrier to a wide variety of other surfaces .",
    "a precise statement is :    [ t : barrier ] @xcite let @xmath3 be a ( possibly disconnected ) 3-manifold with homeomorphic boundary components @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the manifold obtained from @xmath3 by the gluing map @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is  sufficiently complicated \" then any incompressible , strongly irreducible , or critical surface in @xmath24 that has relatively low genus can be isotoped to lie entirely in @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath27 then the words  relatively low genus \" can be dropped from the statement of the above theorem . in all other cases",
    "the more complicated the map @xmath26 is , the higher the genus of the surface can be that we can guarantee will lie entirely in @xmath3 .",
    "theorem [ t : barrier ] is the heart of the techniques discussed here .",
    "this is the main technical result used to obtain proofs of theorems [ t : mainfamily ] through [ t : highgenusgordonisotopy ] .",
    "theorem [ t : barrier ] is a generalization of several previous results .",
    "proofs of theorem [ t : barrier ] in the incompressible case have been given using both minimal surfaces and normal surfaces .",
    "proofs in the strongly irreducible case have been given when @xmath3 is disconnected by lackenby using ( unstable ) minimal surfaces @xcite and li using almost normal surfaces @xcite .",
    "there should certainly be a proof using minimal surfaces in the critical case , but it has only been conjectured that such surfaces can be isotoped to be minimal @xcite .    in lieu of this",
    "we use techniques from normal surface theory to establish the result .",
    "we prove in @xcite that if theorem [ t : barrier ] is false , then there are normal - like surfaces in @xmath3 whose boundaries on @xmath28 and @xmath29 are a bounded distance apart in the curve complex after gluing via @xmath26 .",
    "theorem [ t : barrier ] then follows from @xcite in the case where @xmath27 and @xmath3 is disconnected , from @xcite when @xmath27 and @xmath3 is connected , and from @xcite when @xmath28 has higher genus .",
    "in this section we illustrate the techniques used to obtain theorems [ t : mainfamily ] through [ t : highgenusgordonisotopy ] . here",
    "we sketch our proof that there is a family of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture that are splittings of a manifold with torus boundary .",
    "1 .   one component of @xmath31 is a torus @xmath32 which is incompressible in @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   the other component of @xmath31 is a high genus surface @xmath13 , which is incompressible in @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   there is a minimal genus heegaard splitting @xmath33 of @xmath30 which separates @xmath13 from @xmath32 , and has genus equal to @xmath34 .",
    "such a manifold is not difficult to construct .",
    "we can obtain a new heegaard splitting @xmath35 of @xmath30 by tubing @xmath33 to a copy of @xmath32 ( pushed slightly into @xmath30 ) .",
    "the resulting splitting does not separate the boundary components of @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that @xmath33 and @xmath35 are not equivalent after _ any _ number of stabilizations in @xmath30 .",
    "this observation is the key to the proof that the heegaard splittings constructed presently give counterexamples to the stabilization conjecture .",
    "now let @xmath36 be a 3-manifold with incompressible boundary , such that @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote a minimal genus heegaard splitting of @xmath36 .",
    "such a manifold can be constructed where @xmath39 . for each homeomorphism @xmath40",
    "let @xmath41 denote the manifold obtained by gluing @xmath30 to @xmath36 via @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath33 and @xmath38 give rise to a heegaard splitting @xmath42 of @xmath43 , called their _ amalgamation _ @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is an amalgamation of @xmath35 and @xmath38 , which we call @xmath44 .        loosely speaking , a _ generalized heegaard splitting _",
    "ghs @xmath2 of a 3-manifold @xmath3 is a pair of sets of orientable , connected surfaces , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , such that each component @xmath48 of the complement of @xmath47 in @xmath3 contains exactly one element @xmath49 of @xmath46 , and @xmath49 is a heegaard surface for @xmath48 . from the point of view of @xcite ,",
    "ghss arise naturally from handle structures .",
    "conversely , given a ghs one can always find an associated handle structure .      1 .   beginning with a ghs ,",
    "form an associated handle structure .",
    "2 .   either ( a )",
    "swap the order of attachment of a 2-handle that had followed a 1-handle , or ( b ) cancel a 1-handle and a 2-handle .",
    "3 .   form the associated ghs of the new handle structure .    in case ( a )",
    "we say the new ghs is obtained from @xmath2 by a _",
    "weak reduction_. in case ( b ) we say it was obtained by _",
    "destabilization_. there is a complexity such that in either case the new ghs is  smaller \" than the original",
    ". if there are no weak reductions or destabilizations for a ghs , then each of its thick levels are strongly irreducible .",
    "scharlemann and thompson showed that this implies that its thin levels must then be incompressible .    a _ sequence of ghss _ ( sog ) is defined to be any sequence where each element is obtained from its predecessor or successor by a weak reduction or destabilization .",
    "if an element @xmath2 of a sog @xmath50 is greater than both its predecessor and its successor then we say it is _ maximal _ in @xmath50 .",
    "just as there are two ways to take a ghs and produce a smaller one , there are ways one can  reduce \" a sog .",
    "if a sog can not be reduced , then each thick level of each maximal ghs is either strongly irreducible or critical and each thin level of each maximal ghs is incompressible .      we are now prepared to sketch the proof of theorem [ t : torusboundarycounterexample ] .",
    "first , observe that the basic set - up of the hypotheses gives us the sog @xmath52 of @xmath53 pictured in figure [ f : nsfinitialsog ] .",
    "if there is no way to reduce the sog @xmath52 then it would follow that the minimal genus common stabilization @xmath54 of @xmath42 and @xmath44 is critical .",
    "since no heegaard surface in @xmath53 can be isotoped to be disjoint from @xmath13 , it now follows from theorem [ t : barrier ] that the genus of @xmath54 must be very high .",
    "hence , if theorem [ t : torusboundarycounterexample ] is false then there must be some way to reduce the sog @xmath52 .",
    "we now assume @xmath55 is obtained from @xmath52 by a maximal sequence of complexity reducing moves .",
    "it follows from theorem [ t : barrier ] that the surface @xmath13 must be an element of @xmath56 for each ghs @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a unique element of @xmath56 , for each element @xmath57 , then the sog @xmath55 can be  broken \" at @xmath13 to obtain separate sogs of @xmath30 and @xmath36 .",
    "see figure [ f : breakf ] .",
    "the first ghs of the sog of @xmath30 thus obtained comes from weak reductions and destabilizations of the heegaard surface @xmath33 .",
    "as such it separates the surfaces @xmath13 and @xmath32 .",
    "the final ghs of this sog is descended from @xmath35 , and therefore does not separate @xmath13 and @xmath32 .",
    "we now have a contradiction , as there can be no sog which interpolates between ghss that partition the boundary of @xmath30 differently .",
    "we conclude that there must be an element @xmath58 of @xmath55 for which the surface @xmath13 appears as two elements of @xmath59 .",
    "hence , there is an element of @xmath60 which lies between two copies of @xmath13 , and is thus a heegaard surface in a submanifold homeomorphic to @xmath61 .",
    "a classification theorem of scharlemann and thompson @xcite tells us that this surface must be two copies of @xmath13 connected by a tube .",
    "( the classification includes one more possibility which is ruled out . )",
    "each ghs has a well - defined _ genus _ , which is the sum of the genera of its thick surfaces minus the sum of the genera of its thin surfaces .",
    "the above argument leads us to the inequality @xmath62 but , an analysis of the complexity reducing moves used to obtain @xmath55 now shows that there must be a ghs of @xmath52 whose genus is at least that of @xmath58 . finally , the genus of the surface @xmath54 is the largest genus of all the ghss in @xmath52 .",
    "putting these inequalities together gives us @xmath63 .",
    "but the genus of @xmath44 is @xmath64 .",
    "the difference between these is the number of times we must stabilize @xmath44 in order to obtain a stabilization of @xmath42 .",
    "this number is @xmath65 , which is also equal to @xmath45 .",
