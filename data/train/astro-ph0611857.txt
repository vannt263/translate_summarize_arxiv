    "the narrow - line region ( nlr ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is ideally suited to study the central region through its various emission lines .",
    "it has the great advantage over the broad - line region ( blr ) to be spatially resolvable , at least for nearby agns . since the nlr is affected by various parameters such as the energy input from the central engine , the existence of a nuclear torus , radio jets , and star formation , it accesses a number of key questions of agn physics .    [ ]",
    "@xmath05007  ( hereafter [ ] ) narrow - band imaging is commonly used to study the nlrs of active galaxies , especially seyferts ( e.g. mulchaey et al .",
    "1996a , falcke et al . 1998 ) . for qsos , this method was first applied by @xcite using an hst emission - line imaging survey of seven radio - quiet pg qsos with z@xmath10.5 . including seven seyferts",
    ", they discovered a relation between nlr size and [ ] luminosity .",
    "this newly found nlr size - luminosity relation connects the nlr of qsos and seyferts over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this relation seems to continue the relation found between blr size and luminosity [ e.g.  @xcite ] , indicating that both blr and nlr size are only determined by the agn luminosity .",
    "indeed both sizes are related , providing the potential to estimate black hole ( bh ) masses from the nlr size @xcite .",
    "still , the question remains whether the nlr size - luminosity relation holds at high luminosity or whether these objects lose their very large , dynamically unbound nlr @xcite .",
    "however , the slope of the nlr size - luminosity relation has been controversial . while @xcite obtained a slope of  0.5 suggesting a self - regulating mechanism that determines the size to scale with the ionization parameter , @xcite report a slope of 0.33 for their sample of 60 seyfert galaxies imaged with hst .",
    "such a slope is expected for a homogeneous gaseous sphere ionized by a central source ( strmgren sphere ) .",
    "when comparing the two samples and calculating a fit to all type-1 and type-2 agns separately , the relation for type-2 agns is close to 0.33 , while type-1 objects are fit with a slope of 0.55 @xcite .",
    "this result explains the different slopes found by the two groups : in the sample of @xcite , type-1 qsos determine the slope whereas the slope of the sample studied by @xcite is dominated by sy2s .",
    "the difference can be explained by the observers viewing angle in the framework of the unified model and a receding torus @xcite .",
    "one problem that remains when studying the nlr by [ ] imaging alone is that this emission can be contaminated by contributions from e.g.  star formation or shock - ionized gas , altering the nlr size .",
    "in addition , the measured size depends on the depth of the images : when comparing ground - based [ ] images of seyfert galaxies from @xcite with the hst snapshot survey of @xcite , the latter reveal , on average , six times smaller nlr sizes , probably due to the 15 to 20 times lower sensitivity .",
    "these considerations question the determination of the `` nlr size '' from [ ] imaging alone .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy is a valuable alternative approach as it can directly probe the size in terms of agn photoionization and discriminate the stellar or shock - ionized contribution by making use of selected emission - line ratios .",
    "in addition , several physical parameters of the nlr such as ionization parameter , electron density , and velocity can be directly accessed and analysed as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "therefore , we studied the nlr of six sy1 and six sy2 galaxies by means of optical longslit spectroscopy with vlt / fors1 and ntt / emmi . in the following ,",
    "we summarize these results , focussing on the nearby seyfert-2 galaxy ngc1386 which can be considered as prototypical for the whole sample . for a detailed discussion of the sample properties , observations , data reduction and analysis , as well as results ,",
    "see bennert et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006a , b , d ) .      from spatially resolved spectral diagnostics",
    ", we find a transition between central line ratios falling into the agn regime and outer ones in the -region regime for four objects in our sample ( two sy1s , two sy2s ; fig .",
    "[ diag ] ( _ left panel _ ) . applying ` cloudy ` @xcite photoionization models , we show that the observed distinction between -like and agn - like ratios in ngc1386 represents a true difference in ionization source and can not be explained by variations of physical parameters such as ionization parameter , electron density or metallicity @xcite .",
    "we interpret it as a real border between the nlr , i.e. the central agn - photoionized region , and surrounding regions .",
    "it allows us to determine the nlr size free of stellar contamination , yielding an nlr radius of 6 .",
    "this is twice as large as the one measured from the @xcite [ ] hst image , due to the low sensitivity of their snap - shot survey . on the other hand , it is half the value derived by @xcite from long - slit spectroscopy as their nlr size includes [ ] emission from surrounding regions .    for almost all 12 seyfert galaxies ,",
    "we find that both the electron density and the ionization parameter decrease with roughly @xmath2 ( fig .  [ density ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with photoionization of the nlr by a central source , supporting our approach to determine the nlr size via diagnostic diagrams .",
