    "star formation is intimately linked with the cold gas content of galaxies .",
    "a large h  supply may be necessary to fuel high sfrs , but the resulting feedback may expel or ionize much of the h  gas . given the extreme levels of star formation and feedback in starburst galaxies , we consider whether their h  content differs from the other galaxies in the alfalfa  h@xmath0  sample .",

    "as shown by @xcite for alfalfa galaxies , sfr correlates with @xmath2  over almost 4 dex in h  mass , indicating a link between atomic gas and star formation .",
    "since part of this trend may result from the tight relation between sfr and galaxy stellar mass , we examine whether highly star - forming galaxies have more h  than galaxies of a similar mass . in figure  [ fig_gasfrac_mstar_sfr ] , we show the ratio of @xmath2  to stellar mass ( @xmath3 ) as a function of sfr and @xmath3 . for consistency with previous h  studies ( e.g. ,   * ?",

    "therefore , in most cases , a high efficiency of h  to h@xmath5  conversion , rather than a large influx of gas , is generating their high levels of star formation .",
    "dynamical disturbances are a likely cause of this enhanced efficiency , allowing the starbursts to transport h  gas inward and generate high gas column densities more easily than non - starbursts ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the balance between h  infall and feedback may lead to a relatively stable h  supply in gas - rich starbursts .",
    "addition of h  gas through interaction with a gas cloud or gas - rich galaxy may initially raise the h  gas fraction .",
    "this excess h  quickly disappears , however , as gas compression or turbulence resulting from these interactions efficiently converts the h  gas to h@xmath5  and stars .",
    "as the starburst progresses , the h  gas fraction may stabilize instead of continuing its decrease .",
    "the starburst may not affect h  gas in the outer galaxy , and photodissociation of molecular gas may replenish h  in the inner regions .",
    "indeed , previous observations have demonstrated that photodissociated gas may be a significant component of the ism in the inner regions of starburst galaxies ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "radiative feedback does not appear sufficient to deplete the h  gas in the starbursts through ionization , and the two high ew starbursts with the highest ratios of h@xmath0  luminosity to h  mass ( i.e. ,  the shortest @xmath4 ) also show the highest h  gas fractions .",
    "after the starburst , the remaining h  reservoir may continue to fuel star formation , or additional feedback mechanisms , such as supernovae , may ultimately quench the burst .      for the alfalfa  h@xmath0  sample as a whole",
    ", we find that galaxies ssfrs and h  gas fractions are only weakly correlated (   [ sec : hisbs ] ) .",
    "this result contrasts with the strong observed correlation between galaxy color and h  gas fraction identified in previous studies ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which suggests that galaxy ssfrs are linked to their h  content ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we likewise observe a tight correlation between h  gas fraction and @xmath23  color . for our sample of gas - rich galaxies , we demonstrate that dust extinction , rather than star formation , drives the tight trend between h  and color .    in essence ,",
    "the h  and color relation is a manifestation of the well - known galaxy mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",

    "recent studies suggest that galaxies in fact lie on a fundamental plane of stellar mass , sfr , and metallicity @xcite , known as the ` fundamental metallicity relation ' .",

    "* ) , and @xcite  show that a fundamental relation exists between h  mass , stellar mass , and metallicity . in this model , @xmath2/@xmath3  and metallicity should anti - correlate .",
    "since more metal - rich galaxies have higher dust content , we would therefore expect galaxies with high @xmath2/@xmath3  to have less dust extinction and bluer colors .",
    "several processes could produce the proposed relation between galaxy stellar mass , h  content , and metallicity .",
    "over their lifetimes , galaxies with higher stellar masses will have both consumed more h  gas and produced more metals via star formation .",
    "in addition , the higher potential wells of more massive galaxies should allow them to retain metals more effectively ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "at a given stellar mass , galaxies that have experienced a recent inflow of metal - poor gas from the igm should have lower overall metallicities as well as higher h  content .",
    "finally , we note that the elevated dust content of metal - rich galaxies will also allow them to convert their h  gas to h@xmath5  more efficiently by shielding molecular gas from uv radiation ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby reducing their h  fractions further .",
    "this connection between h  content and dust extinction provides a natural explanation for the observed relation between h  gas fraction and color .",
    "h  inflows and outflows are fundamentally important to the evolution of galaxy metallicities , while galaxy metallicity may also influence the h  supply by promoting h@xmath5  formation .",
    "another factor that may enhance the conversion of h  to h@xmath5  is galaxy structure .",
    "we find that the h  depletion time in disk - dominated systems anti - correlates with stellar surface density (   [ sec_sfe ] ) .",
    "this relation may indicate that higher disk mid - plane pressure aids the formation of molecular clouds and increases the h@xmath5/h  ratio , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , alternate theories of h@xmath5  formation based on self - shielding ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may result in a similar stellar surface density scaling relation @xcite .",
    "early supernova feedback in low - mass galaxies may lead to the delayed infall of h  gas , resulting in an increased h  content and longer depletion time at the present day @xcite . by suppressing past star formation episodes",
    ", this efficient feedback should also lead to lower present - day stellar surface densities .",
    "we only observe this correlation between h  depletion time and stellar surface density in disk galaxies , however .",
    "we show that high - mass , early - type galaxies from the gass sample @xcite do not follow a similar relation . within this early - type sample ,",
    "we find no correlation between h  depletion time and morphology , which suggests that bulge strength is not affecting the current sfe in these galaxies .",
    "instead , we suggest that the scatter in sfe results from differences in the spatial distribution and surface density of the h  gas .      for several of the starbursts",
    ", major mergers may induce their high sfrs and high h  to h@xmath5  conversion efficiencies (   [ sec_merge ] ) . during interactions ,",
    "tidal torques propel gas toward the center of galaxies , thereby raising the gas column density ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and allowing galaxies to access their external h  supply .",
    "furthermore , turbulent motions during the merger may compress gas clouds @xcite , leading to a higher fraction of dense gas and a higher h@xmath5/h  ratio @xcite .",
    "starbursts also appear to form stars from h@xmath5  more efficiently than non - starbursts ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps due to the higher mean density and shorter free - fall time in their ism @xcite .",
    "a merger scenario could therefore explain the moderate h  but high sfrs of at least some of the alfalfa  h@xmath0  starbursts .",
    "evidence of morphological and kinematical disturbances support a merger origin for several of the starbursts .",
    "we find that the high ew starbursts optical morphologies are more asymmetric and their h  velocity profiles have wider wings than most of the non - starbursts .",
    "merger simulations predict that the peak star formation activity should occur near coalescence ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the starbursts morphologies .",
    "the highest asymmetries , however , should appear shortly before coalescence .",
    "interestingly , our two most asymmetric starbursts , which appear to be in this merger stage , also have higher - than - average h  gas fractions for their stellar mass .",
    "their high h  gas fractions suggest that h  conversion to h@xmath5  may be an ongoing process during merger - driven star formation ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "due to the unresolved nature of the arecibo h  observations , we do not know the surface density of the h  gas in the alfalfa  h@xmath0  starbursts . however , we find that they have above - average ratios of @xmath2  to the galaxy optical area . therefore , either they lie closer to the maximum column density threshold for h , which would aid h@xmath5  formation , or their h  is significantly more extended than the optical disk .",
    "for instance , extended h  tidal tails may contain a large fraction of the h  gas in merging galaxies ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the evidence for mergers among the lowest mass starbursts is less clear , in part due to their lower s / n optical images and h  spectra .",
    "their h  velocity profiles do not noticeably differ from the profiles of low - mass non - starbursts , which may indicate a lack of kinematical disturbances .",
    "resolved h  observations likewise indicate that ordered kinematics are not uncommon in dwarf starbursts @xcite .",
    "however , if the dwarf starbursts experience periodic bursts , any initial disturbance may no longer be evident ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we observe an increased scatter in sfe at the low - mass end of our sample , which supports this scenario of episodic bursts in dwarf galaxies .",
    "supernova feedback may have a stronger effect in the low potential wells of dwarf galaxies , leading to temporary quenching and a renewed burst of star formation as neutral gas falls back into the galaxy ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "higher resolution imaging and h  spectral observations will be necessary to determine whether or not the dwarf starbursts are merging systems .    finally , the spiral structure and orderly h  velocity profiles of the three highest mass starbursts , agc 330186 , ugc 470 , and ugc 12821 , suggest they are not experiencing a major merger .",
    "ugc 470 has a higher than average gas fraction for its stellar mass and is known to have an unusually extended h  disk @xcite .",
    "it is also the only starburst in the sample with a typical h  depletion time for its stellar mass or @xmath6 ( figures  [ fig_gtbins ]  and [ fig_ssd_gt ] ) . unlike the other starbursts ,",
    "ugc 470 s excess gas supply , rather than a high h - to - h@xmath5  conversion efficiency , may account for its enhanced star formation .",
    "minor mergers or other minor disturbances may temporarily increase the sfr for agc 330186 and ugc 12821 , and most of the h  disk may remain undisturbed .",
    "we therefore propose the following picture for the cycling of h  and star formation throughout the strongest starburst episodes . in the intermediate mass starbursts ,",
    "a gas - rich major merger triggers the star formation . as the two galaxies approach coalescence , the total stellar mass of the system increases .",
    "since the two individual galaxies have h  gas fractions typical of lower mass galaxies , the combined system appears to have a higher h  mass than other galaxies of a similar total mass .",
    "strong tidal torques drive h  gas outward to form tidal tails and inward to fuel star formation . at this time",
    ", the system appears progressively more morphologically disturbed , and the increased gas flows and turbulence create kinematically disturbed h  profiles .",
    "the two most asymmetric starbursts in our sample , agc 330517 and agc 330500 , are possible examples of this stage , exhibiting disturbed morphologies , disturbed h  kinematics , and elevated h  gas fractions . as the h  gas flows inward , turbulence and gas compression efficiently convert h  to h@xmath5 , reducing the h  gas fraction and increasing the sfr .",
    "although the gas flows bring h  inward , star formation is not necessarily restricted to the nuclear region , consistent with recent simulations ( e.g. ,   * ? ?",
    "* ) and with the varied h@xmath0  morphologies of the alfalfa  h@xmath0  starbursts (   [ sec_merge ] ) .",
    "turbulent , dense clumps may arise throughout the merging disks , and the precise merger configuration affects the spatial distribution of star formation .",
    "the influx of h  gas raises the ism column density , and the star formation rate increases to the point where supernova - driven turbulence supports the enhanced weight of the ism @xcite .",
    "peak star formation occurs near final coalescence , as the morphological disturbances are fading ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may explain the slightly lower asymmetries of some of the starbursts ( e.g. ,  agc 120193 and agc 331191 ) . however , at the time of the peak sfr , the turbulent motions driving star formation are still high @xcite and the h  kinematics should still show higher velocities , as we observe in the high velocity wings of the high ew alfalfa  h@xmath0  starbursts h  profiles .",
    "the h  content also begins to drop , due to the enhanced h@xmath5  fraction and photoionization .",
    "nevertheless , the starbursts still maintain a large h  supply , comparable to similar mass non - starburst galaxies (   [ sec : hisbs ] ) .",
    "radiative feedback does not completely ionize the starbursts h  reservoirs and may only ionize the h  gas near the starburst region ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , h@xmath5  photodissociation may compensate for the ionization of h  in the inner regions .",
    "consistent with this scenario , recent h  observations of post - merger galaxies demonstrate that star formation and feedback do not noticeably deplete the h  reservoirs of merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "ultimately , gas consumption or feedback terminates the starburst , and the final merged galaxy exhibits a higher stellar mass , higher metallicity , and lower h  gas fraction than its individual progenitors",
    ".    lower mass galaxies may experience recurrent starbursts , leading to the enhanced scatter in @xmath4 and ssfr in the low - mass end of our sample .",
    "they may accumulate h  from the igm until a dynamical disturbance initiates strong star formation .",
    "for instance , this initial trigger could be a merger with another galaxy , an interaction with a dark matter subhalo @xcite , or a merger with a gas cloud . in the case of a gas cloud merger",
    ", the initial interaction should raise the h  content and disturb the h  kinematics , but may not trigger an immediate starburst @xcite .",
    "subsequent infall from the gas cloud or enhanced turbulence may then induce a later starburst .",
    "the morphology of the star formation should vary depending on the nature of the interaction and the gas cloud trajectory , consistent with the range of h@xmath0  morphologies we observe (   [ sec_merge ] ) .",
    "regardless of the cause of the initial burst , supernova feedback rapidly quenches the initial starburst due to the low potential well of the galaxy ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this feedback may increase the h  velocity dispersion , but these kinematic disturbances should lag the peak star formation @xcite . after the starburst dies down , the re - accretion of previously expelled gas may trigger a series of subsequent starbursts ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , massive star clusters formed in a prior burst may generate torques that continue to drive h  gas inward ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ? * ) to fuel future starbursts .",
    "thus , low - mass starbursts may lack the clear signs of kinematic disturbances that should characterize higher - mass interacting starbursts , as illustrated by the similar h  velocity profiles of the low - mass starbursts and non - starbursts in our sample (   [ sec_merge ] ) .",
    "these starburst cycles may gradually reduce a dwarf galaxy s h  reservoir but are unlikely to deplete it entirely , given the starbursts high h  gas fractions .",
    "as with the more massive starbursts , photoionization may not affect the outer h  gas and may be balanced by photodissociation near the starburst .",
    "consequently , the h  gas fractions of low - mass starbursts may also remain relatively constant , with little variation with respect to non - starbursts , and may provide a plentiful neutral gas supply capable of fueling multiple starburst episodes .",
    "the similar h  gas fractions of the alfalfa  h@xmath0  starbursts and non - starbursts agree with this scenario (   [ sec : hisbs ] ) , as do observations of the h  content of interacting dwarf galaxies relative to isolated dwarfs @xcite . by quickly quenching star formation",
    ", the high feedback efficiencies in the dwarf starbursts may prevent rapid increases in metallicity or stellar mass .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the flat star formation histories and relatively inefficient star formation inferred for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the dwarf starbursts periodic star formation mode may be particularly relevant to high - redshift star formation .",
    "milky way progenitors at @xmath85  may accrete gas from the igm in discrete episodes that trigger enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "however , as with the dwarf starbursts , feedback efficiently expels the gas and delays its consumption ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , these galaxies may have variable sfrs and may maintain an elevated h  content that fuels later star formation ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "however , unlike @xmath86  galaxies , @xmath87  galaxies experience higher accretion rates from the igm ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "high - redshift galaxies may therefore have higher average sfrs and larger gas reservoirs than we observe for the alfalfa  h@xmath0  sample .",
    "feedback and variable sfrs in low - mass galaxies also have important implications for the reionization of the igm .",
    "@xcite  argue that by suppressing star formation , efficient feedback may reduce the contribution of the lowest mass galaxies to reionization .",

    ", we analyze the h  gas fractions , h  depletion times , h  kinematics , and optical morphologies of 14 starbursts within the 565 galaxies that make up the alfalfa  h@xmath0  fall - sky sample .",
    "this sample illuminates the roles of gas accretion and feedback in determining the h  content of starburst galaxies and in triggering and sustaining star formation .      1 .   on average ,",
    "the alfalfa  h@xmath0  galaxies with higher instantaneous ssfrs tend to have slightly higher h  gas fractions , but this trend is weak and shows substantial scatter .",
    "galaxies with ssfrs that differ by an order of magnitude may still have the same h  gas fraction , and most of the starburst galaxies have h  gas fractions similar to galaxies with significantly lower sfrs .",
    "in contrast , we observe a tight trend between h  gas fraction and @xmath23  color .",
    "we show that dust extinction , rather than recent star formation , is primarily responsible for the tight h - color correlation .",
    "this link between dust extinction and h  gas fraction likely stems from the relation between stellar mass , metallicity , and h  content in galaxies @xcite .",
    "2 .   disk galaxies lie on a sequence of decreasing h  depletion time with increasing stellar surface density .",
    "the observed trend is consistent with the idea that higher midplane pressures encourage the formation of h@xmath5  from h  @xcite .",
    "disk galaxies from the gass sample @xcite also fall on this sequence , while spheroid - dominated systems are offset to higher @xmath4 .",
    "the spread in the h  depletion times of the spheroids reflects a spread in ssfr , but shows no trend with either h  gas fraction or bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "instead , the spatial distribution of h  in early - type galaxies likely determines whether gas clouds can reach the necessary densities to form molecular gas .",
    "3 .   gas - rich starbursts are able to maintain a relatively constant h  supply .",
    "most of the 14 starbursts show little to no increase in @xmath2/@xmath3  or @xmath9  relative to galaxies of a similar mass ; by the time of the starburst episode , any excess atomic gas has already been converted into h@xmath5 .",
    "however , we do find a few exceptions to this scenario .",
    "the extended h  disk of ugc 470 may fuel its elevated star formation .",
    "in addition , the two most optically asymmetric starbursts , which appear to be in a pre - coalescent merger stage , do show some evidence for enhanced h  gas fractions .",
    "these asymmetric galaxies suggest that the conversion of excess h  to h@xmath5  is an ongoing process during mergers .",
    "ionization does not appear to substantially deplete the starbursts h  gas , and photodissociation of h@xmath5  may compensate for decreases in h  due to consumption and ionization . although we do not find that starbursts are unusually h - rich , we also do not find that starbursts are h - deficient , as suggested for starbursts in the singg sample @xcite .",
    "instead , high @xmath6 galaxies span a wide range of h  gas fractions .",
    "the similarity of the h  gas fractions of starbursts and non - starbursts may indicate that the intense ionizing radiation of the starbursts does not penetrate to the outermost regions hosting much of the h  mass .",
    "the starbursts use their h  more efficiently than the rest of the sample , as indicated by their lower h  depletion times relative to galaxies of a similar mass or stellar surface density .",
    "major mergers may cause these high efficiencies in at least some of these starbursts , as suggested by the starbursts asymmetric optical morphologies and the wide h  velocity profile wings in several starbursts .",
    "the high optical asymmetries of two starbursts are consistent with major mergers .",
    "the lower , but slightly elevated asymmetries of an additional six starbursts may indicate either more minor disturbances or mergers near coalescence , the merger phase predicted to cause the largest enhancement in sfr .",
    "finally , consistent with recent merger simulations ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that extended , rather than nuclear , star formation may dominate the morphologies of some starbursts .",
    "while some of the starbursts are likely mergers , the lowest mass starbursts , with @xmath82 , do not show clear evidence of disturbed optical morphologies or h  kinematics .",
    "these dwarf starbursts may undergo periodic bursts , possibly triggered by a previous interaction , in which case unusual gas kinematics might not be apparent @xcite .",
    "large fluctuations in sfr appear characteristic of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the dwarf galaxies in our sample also show a larger scatter in sfe than more massive galaxies .",
    "the large , apparently sustainable h  gas fractions of low - mass starbursts may provide ample fuel for multiple generations of starbursts .",
    "the alfalfa  h@xmath0  galaxies demonstrate that while starbursts may differ dramatically from non - starbursts in their molecular gas content , the atomic gas fractions of starbursts and non - starbursts are similar .",
    "efficient conversion of atomic to molecular gas reduces any h  excess , and the localized starburst may not affect the galaxy s extended h  reservoir .",
