    "for the cms configuration our dps contribution is smaller than the dijet sps contribution even at high rapidity distances and only slightly smaller than that for the nll bfkl calculation known from the literature .",
    "the dps final state topology is clearly different than that for the dijet sps ( four versus two jets ) which may help to disentangle the two mechanisms experimentally .",
    "we have shown that the relative effect of dps can be increased by lowering the transverse momenta .",
    "alternatively one could study correlations of semihard pions distant in rapidity .",
    "correlations of two neutral pions could be done , at least in principle , with the help of so - called zero - degree calorimeters present at each main detectors at the lhc .",
    "the dps effects are interesting not only in the context how they contribute to distribution in rapidity distance but per se .",
    "one could make use of correlations in jet transverse momenta , jet imbalance and azimuthal correlations to enhance the contribution of dps .",
    "further detailed monte carlo studies are required to settle real experimental program of such studies .",
    "the four - jet final states analyses of distributions in rapidity distance and other kinematical observables was performed by us very recently @xcite .",
    "finally we have discussed dps effects in inclusive production of @xmath2 pairs .",
    "we have shown that the relative contribution of dps grows with collision energy . in experiments one measures rather electrons or muons than the gauge bosons .",
    "whether experimental identification of the dps contribution in this case is possible requires a detailed monte carlo studies .",
    "this presentation is based on common work mostly with rafa maciua and partially with jonathan gaunt , marta uszczak and wolfgang schfer .",
    "i am very indebted to rafa maciua for help in preparing this manuscript .",
