    "if supersymmetry exists at an energy scale of  1 tev , susy particles such as gluinos and squarks should be abundantly produced at the lhc .",
    "assuming r - parity conservation , these particles cascade down to the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) . a detailed discussion of possible susy effects at the lhc is given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a mass reconstruction of the lightest stau ( @xmath2 ) in the cascade decay    @xmath4    the gluino decay chain ( [ chain ] ) is shown in fig.([fig : chain ] )        the study of sleptons and squarks of third generation is of a special interest .",
    "their masses can be very different than that of sparticles of the first and second generation , because of the effects of large yukawa and soft couplings in the renormalization group equations .",
    "furthermore they can show large mixing in pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the properties of @xmath2 are also important for determination of the dark matter relic density .",
    "the reconstruction of a susy event is complicated because of escaping lsps and many complex and competing decay modes . at present",
    "there are two different approaches to susy mass reconstruction .",
    "the  endpoint method \" , which has been widely studied @xcite - @xcite for the lhc at high integrated luminosity of about @xmath7 , looks for kinematic endpoints of invariant mass distributions .",
    "the second method of susy particle mass reconstruction is the ",
    "mass relation approach `` @xcite - @xcite , based on the mass relation equation which relates susy particle masses and measured momenta of detected particles .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the ' ' mass relation approach \" can be used for luminosities as low as a few @xmath8 .    in this work the cascade mass reconstruction approach @xcite , that we developed earlier and applied to a different susy cascade decay , is used for mass reconstruction of the lightest stau at the lhc energy of 14 tev with an integrated luminosity of about @xmath9 .",
    "the stau mass is reconstructed assuming that the masses of the gluino , bottom squark and two lightest neutralinos were reconstructed in advance . at high integrated luminosity",
    "the stau mass could be extracted directly from the endpoint of @xmath10 invariant mass distribution . however at integrated luminosities below 10 @xmath11",
    "the problem becomes quite challenging because there is no a sharp edge in the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution because of escaping neutrinos , a reconstructed stau mass is very sensitive to uncertainties in input parameters ( neutralino masses ) and there is a high level of susy background .",
    "the cascade mass reconstruction approach @xcite applied for stau mass reconstruction in this work is based on a consecutive use of the endpoint method , an event filter and a combinatorial mass reconstruction method .",
    "the endpoint method is used to get a rough estimate of the stau mass and the corresponding errors .",
    "this first estimate of mass is used by an event filter for each event in the data sample to reduce background for the following mass reconstruction step .",
    "finally , the stau mass is reconstructed by a maximization of a combined likelihood function , which depends on all five sparticle masses ( gluino , bottom squark , stau and two lightest neutralinos ) , and is constructed for each possible combination of five events in the data sample .",
    "we choose for this study the su3 model point .",
    "this point has a significant production cross section for the chain ( [ chain ] ) ; gluinos and squarks should be produced abundantly at the lhc .",
    "the bulk point su3 is the official benchmark point of the atlas collaboration and it is in agreement with the recent precision wmap data  @xcite .",
    "this model point is described by the set of msugra parameters given in table ( [ tab : paramth ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    .msugra parameters for the su3 point . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it follows from table [ tab : reco ] that reconstruction errors after the final step are significantly reduced in comparison with preliminary estimates [ tab : reco1 ] obtained by end - point method .    in order to illustrate a spread in reconstructed masses the results of table [ tab : reco ] are also shown in a form of ideogram @xcite in fig.[fig_ideo1 ] for the five data sample sets . each reconstructed mass in an ideogram is represented by a gaussian with a central value @xmath12 , error @xmath13 and area proportional to 1/@xmath13 .",
    "the solid curve is a sum of these gaussians .    .",
    "the triangle marker gives the position of the su3 theoretical mass .",
    "points with error bars correspond to five data sample sets.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the gaussian form of the ideogram and relatively small shift of peak positions with respect to theoretical masses demonstrate the self - consistency of stau mass reconstruction approach .",
    "we applied the cascade mass reconstruction approach developed in @xcite to reconstruction of @xmath2 mass at the lhc with a low integrated luminosity of about @xmath9 at 14 tev .",
    "this luminosity can be reached in the early stage of lhc operation . at low integrated luminosity stau mass reconstruction",
    "is complicated because escaping neutrinos modify the edge of the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution , reconstructed stau mass is very sensitive to uncertainties in input parameters ( neutralino masses ) and the level of susy background is high .",
    "our approach to the stau mass reconstruction was based on a consecutive use of the endpoint method , an event filter and a combinatorial mass reconstruction method .",
    "the endpoint method allows preliminary estimate of @xmath14 mass by assuming that sparticle masses required as input parameters for this procedure are known from the same experiment with a precision of about @xmath15 for heavy sparticles ( such as gluino and bottom squark ) and about @xmath3 for the two lightest neutralinos . in this work",
    "these input masses were obtained by the cascade mass reconstruction approach @xcite . at high integrated luminosity of @xmath7",
    "they could be found by using one of techniques proposed in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the stau mass was reconstructed with a precision of about @xmath3",
