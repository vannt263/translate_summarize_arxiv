    "<S> we consider a scheme of multiplexed cold atomic ensembles that generate a frequency - entangled biphoton state with controllable entropy of entanglement .  </S>",
    "<S> the biphoton state consists of a telecommunication photon ( signal ) immediately followed by an infrared one ( idler ) via four - wave mixing with two classical pump fields .  </S>",
    "<S> multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency and phase - shifted signal and idler emissions , we can manipulate and control the spectral property of the biphoton state .  </S>",
    "<S> mapping out the entropy of entanglement in the scheme provides the optimal configuration for entanglement resources .  </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way for efficient long - distance quantum communication and for potentially useful multimode structures in quantum information processing . </S>"
