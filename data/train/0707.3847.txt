    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a highly compressible turbulent , magnetized fluid , exhibiting density fluctuations on all observable scales .",
    "it has been long realized by many researchers that incompressible hydrodynamic , i.e. kolmogorov , description is inadequate for such a medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "scaling relations , if they were obtained for the interstellar gas , would be very helpful for addressing many problems , including the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation .",
    "attempts to include effects of compressibility into the interstellar turbulence description can be dated as far back as the work by @xcite .",
    "there a simple model based on a hierarchy of clouds was presented . according to this picture every large cloud",
    "consists a certain number of smaller clouds , which contain even smaller clouds .",
    "for such a model @xcite proposed a relation between subsequent levels of hierarchy @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average density inside a cloud at level @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the mean size of that cloud , 3 is the number of dimensions , and @xmath9 is constant that reflects the degree of compression at each level @xmath7 .",
    "the kolmogorov energy spectrum ( @xmath10 ) follows from the assumption of a constant specific energy transfer rate @xmath11 .",
    "lighthill @xcite pointed out that , in a compressible fluid , the volume energy transfer rate is constant in a statistical steady state @xmath12    in an important , but not sufficiently appreciated work , fleck @xcite ( henceforth , f96 ) incorporated above hierarchical model with energy transfer in compressible fluid to obtain the scaling relations for compressible turbulence . by combining the equations ( [ eqn : hierar ] ) and ( [ eqn : enden ] ) fleck @xcite presented the following set of scaling relations in terms of the degree of compression @xmath9 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the column density of the fluctuation with the scale @xmath16 and the mass of the cloud of size @xmath16 .",
    "the fluctuations of velocities in f96 model entail the spectrum of velocities @xmath17 .    in the spirit of f96 model , @xcite proposed to use the density - weighted velocity @xmath18 as a new quantity , for which the kolmogorov scaling for second order structure functions ( sfs ) can be restored in compressible hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "their hydrodynamic simulations provided the spectrum for @xmath19 close to -5/3 and they showed that in supersonic hydrodynamic turbulence the structure functions of @xmath19 scale linearly with separation .",
    "will the f96 model be valid for compressible _ strongly magnetized _ turbulence ?",
    "this is the major question that we address in this paper .",
    "we used an second - order - accurate essentially nonoscillatory ( eno ) scheme ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for details ) to solve the ideal isothermal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in a periodic box with maintaining the @xmath20 constraint numerically .",
    "we drove the turbulence at wave scale @xmath21 ( 2.5 times smaller than the size of the box ) using a random solenoidal large - scale driving acceleration .",
    "this scale defines the injection scale in our models .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath22 is maintained to be approximately unity , so that @xmath4 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the rms velocity of the system and @xmath23 as the alfvn velocity in the same units .",
    "the time @xmath24 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath25 ) and the length in units of @xmath26 , the scale of the energy injection .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath27 . initially @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we use units in which the alfvn speed @xmath30 and @xmath31 initially . structures of density , velocity and magnetic field develop completely due to the forcing from uniform initial conditions . the values of @xmath32 have been chosen to be similar to those observed in the ism turbulence . for our calculations we assumed that @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", the sound speed is the controlling parameter , and basically two regimes can exist : supersonic and subsonic .",
    "note that within our model , supersonic means low @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , i.e. the magnetic pressure dominates , and subsonic means high @xmath34 , i.e. the gas pressure dominates .",
    "we present results for selected 3d numerical experiments of compressible mhd turbulence with a strong magnetic field for sonic mach numbers @xmath36 between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the alfvnic mach number @xmath39 .",
    "mach numbers are defined as @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the sonic and alfvnic mach number , respectively . to study effects of magnetization we also performed superalfvnic experiments with @xmath42 .",
    "all models were calculated with the resolution 512@xmath0 up to 6 dynamical times .",
    "in figure  [ fig : spectra ] we present the spectra for velocity @xmath4 and density - weighted velocity @xmath1 for two strongly magnetized models : subsonic ( @xmath43 ) and supersonic ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "naturally , for subsonic model the differences between spectra for @xmath4 and @xmath3 are marginal and both spectra correspond to kolmogorov s @xmath45 scaling ( see subplot in fig .  [",

    "however , we can see that for the supersonic case , the velocity spectrum gets steeper .",
    "the steepening corresponds to @xmath46 ( from @xmath47 ) . at the same time",

    "[ fig : spectra],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the original kolmogorov theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k41 ) it was shown that the exponent of the third order structure function ( sf ) , e.g. structure function of @xmath4 , @xmath48 , should be equal 1 , i.e. @xmath49 . in figure",

    "however , those slopes still give a close to gs95 anisotropy ( @xmath74 ) , which is indicative of the dominance of the alfvnic ( `` incompressible '' ) motions .",
    "note , that in figure  [ fig : local_frame ] the sfs are obtained in the system of reference of the _ local _ magnetic field , i.e. the field on the scales of the fluctuations under study . @xmath75 and",

    "the latter roughly consistent with @xmath9 obtained for the velocity sf measurement in section `` kolmogorov scalings for supersonic flows '' .",
    "the differences are probably due to insufficient statistics of rather rare high density peaks . in general , the filling factor of a peak decreases with the maximum density of this peak , which means that the higher maximum of density the peak has the smaller space it occupies .      what is the effect of magnetic field on the @xmath3-scaling ? the spectra , third and higher moments of correlations obtained for our superalfvnic simulations with @xmath99 happen to be very similar to the case of strongly magnetized turbulence .",
