    "the standard model to describe the generation of energy in the nucleus of quasars and agn is the thin accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "this model not only explains the luminosities of quasars , but also predicts observables such as the disk size and its dependence on wavelength .",
    "in particular , the scaling of the disk size with wavelength , or equivalently , the temperature profile of the disk , is a fundamental test for any disk theory .",
    "well away from the inner edge , a temperature profile @xmath1 translates into a size profile @xmath8 , where the characteristic size can be thought of as the radius where the rest wavelength matches the disk temperature .",
    "the simple shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) disk has @xmath9 and hence @xmath4 .",
    "one of the most effective means of measuring accretion disk sizes is gravitational microlensing of lensed quasars ( wambsganss 2006 ) .",

    "a generic outcome of these studies is that the disks are larger than predicted .",
    "one possible solution is to modify the disk temperature profiles , and this can be tested using microlensing by measuring the dependence of the disk size on wavelength .",
    "there are fewer estimates of the wavelength dependence of the size ( see blackburne et al .",

    "these studies generally find that the shorter wavelength emission regions are more compact , but the estimates of the scaling exponent @xmath10 have both large individual uncertainties and a broad scatter between studies . only blackburne et al .",
    "( 2011a ) have found little or no dependence of size on wavelength .",
    "single epoch broad band photometry is affected by several potential systematic problems : i ) broad lines , which are known to be less affected by microlensing both observationally ( e.g. guerras et al .",
    "2013a ) and theoretically ( e.g. abajas et al . 2002 ) , ii ) differential extinction of the images by the lens galaxy ( e.g. falco et al . 1999 , muoz et al .",
    "2004 ) , and iii ) uncertainties in the macro model lens magnification .",
    "the effects of extinction and modeling uncertainties can be eliminated by analysing the time variability produced by microlensing , but the effects of line contamination must still be modeled ( e.g. see the dai et al .",
    "2010 analysis of rxj1131@xmath111231 ) . we can remove the effect of broad line contamination by using spectroscopy ( mediavilla et al . 2011a , motta et al .",
    "2012 ) or narrow band photometry ( mosquera et al . 2009 , mosquera et al . 2011 ) to measure the continuum between the lines .",
    "if the continuum and line flux ratios can be separately measured , then the line flux ratios can also be used to eliminate the effects of extinction and model uncertainties on the continuum flux ratios to the extent that the lines are little affected by microlensing .",
    "even with spectra , there are residual issues coming from line contributions to the apparent continuum .",
    "the most important of these are the emission from feii in the wavelength range from 1800 to 3500    and the balmer continuum in the range from 2700 to 3800   ( wills , netzer & wills 1985 ) .",
    "the contribution of these pseudo - continua to the measured continuum flux varies from object to object , and its effect on the estimate of the continuum microlensing magnifications is difficult to assess .",
    "if the uv emitting fe ii comes from a region similar in size to the continuum source as suggested by guerras et al .",
    "( 2013b ) , it would be similarly affected by microlensing . on the other hand , the balmer continuum likely forms on larger scales and would be less affected by microlensing ( see maoz et al .",
    "1993 ) . like including a broad line",
    ", it would dilute the microlensing of the continuum .",
    "since the balmer continuum peaks near the balmer limit at 3646  , it primarily affects the redder portion of the wavelength ranges we consider here and so could slightly bias our results towards steeper slopes ( higher @xmath10 ) .",

    "<S> we use multi - wavelength microlensing measurements of a sample of 10 image pairs from 8 lensed quasars to study the structure of their accretion disks . by using spectroscopy or narrow band photometry </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to remove contamination from the weakly microlensed broad emission lines , extinction and any uncertainties in the large - scale macro magnification of the lens model . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a maximum likelihood estimate for the exponent of the size versus wavelength scaling ( @xmath0 corresponding to a disk temperature profile of @xmath1 ) of @xmath2 , and a bayesian estimate of @xmath3 , which are significantly smaller than the prediction of thin disk theory ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained a maximum likelihood estimate for the average quasar accretion disk size of @xmath5 lt - day at a rest frame wavelength of @xmath6 for microlenses with a mean mass of @xmath7 , in agreement with previous results , and larger than expected from thin disk theory . </S>"
