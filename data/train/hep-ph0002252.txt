    "@xcite and found to be large , negative in sign , and plagued by considerable theoretical uncertainty .",
    "generally , @xmath20 contains two classes of contributions .",
    "the first involve electroweak radiative corrections to the elementary @xmath22 amplitudes , where @xmath23 is any one of the quarks in the proton .",
    "these radiative corrections , referred to henceforth as one - quark \" radiative corrections , are calculable in the standard model .",
    "they contain little theoretical uncertainty apart from the gentle variation with higgs mass and long - distance qcd effects involving light - quark loops in the @xmath24 mixing tensor .",
    "the one - quark contributions can be large , due to the absence from loops of the small @xmath25 factor appearing at tree level ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : epasym ] ) ) and the presence of large logarithms of the type @xmath26 .    a second class of radiative corrections , which we refer to as many - quark \" corrections , involve weak interactions among quarks in the proton .",
    "in this paper , we focus on those many - quark corrections which generate an axial vector coupling of the photon to the proton ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this axial vector @xmath27 interaction , also known as the anapole moment ( am ) , has the form @xmath28 ( here , we have elected to normalize the interaction to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath29 . )",
    "these many - quark anapole contributions to @xmath20 , which are independent of the electroweak gauge parameter@xcite , were first studied in ref .",

    "the scale of this uncertainty was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this value was used to obtain the theoretical error in eq .",

    "the sample collaboration performed a second backward angle pv measurement using quasielastic ( qe ) scattering from the deuteron .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath31 is significantly less sensitive to @xmath30 than is @xmath32 , but retains a strong dependence on @xmath33 , the _ isovector _ part of @xmath20 . the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite found the uncertainty in @xmath20 to be dominated by this isovector component@xmath34and the goal of the deuterium measurement was , therefore , to constrain the size of this largest term .",
    "a preliminary deuterium result was reported at the recent bates25 symposium at mit , and suggests that @xmath33 has the same negative sign as computed in ref .",
    "@xcite but has considerably larger magnitude , possibly of order unity@xcite . combining this result with the previous @xmath32 measurement would yield a nearly vanishing value for @xmath30 , rather than the large and positive value quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmsep ] ) .",
    "the prospective sample result for @xmath33 is remarkable , indicating that a higher - order electroweak radiative correction is of the same magnitude as , and cancels against , the tree - level amplitude !",
    "the occurance of such enhanced electroweak radiative corrections is rare .",
    "nevertheless , there does exist at least one other instance in which higher - order electroweak processes can dominate the axial vector hadronic response , namely , the nuclear anapole moment .",
    "the anapole moment of a heavy nucleus grows as @xmath35 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ refs . @xcite and references therein ) . because of the scaling with mass number , the nuclear am contribution to a @xmath36 amplitude can be considerably larger than the corresponding tree - level @xmath37-exchange amplitude , and this @xmath35 enhancement is consistent with the size of the cesium am recently determined by the boulder group using atomic parity - violation@xcite .",
    "the reason behind the enhancement of @xmath33 for the few - nucleon system , however , is _ not _ understood .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to investigate whether there exist c onventional , hadronic physics effects which can explain the enhancement apparently implied by the sample deuterium measurement .    in order to address this question , we revisit the analysis of ref .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we re - cast that analysis into the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite .",
    "we carry out a complete calculation of @xmath33 and @xmath38 to order @xmath39 , including loop diagrams not considered in refs .",
    "we also extend those analyses to include decuplet as well as octet intermediate states , magnetic insertions , and su(3 ) chiral symmetry . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the chiral counterterms at @xmath1 using vector meson saturation . however , we go beyond that previous analysis and determine the sign of this vector meson contribution phenomenologically .",
    "we find that decuplet intermediate states and magnetic insertions do not contribute up to the chiral order at which we truncate .",
    "also , the effect of su(3 ) symmetry , in the guise of kaon loops , is generally smaller than the pion loops considered previously . in the end , we express our results in terms of effective pv hadronic couplings .",
    "some of these couplings may be determined from nuclear and hadronic pv experiments or detailed calculations ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , while others are presently unconstrained by measurement . guided by phenomenology and the dimensional analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the range of possible values for the new couplings . we suspect that our estimates are overly generous",
    "nevertheless , we find that  even under liberal assumptions ",
    "the am contributions to @xmath33 appear unable to enhance the one - quark corrections to the level apparently observed by the sample collaboration and , in our conclusions , we speculate on possible additional sources of enhancement not considered here .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we relate the anapole couplings @xmath40 to the radiative corrections , @xmath41 , and in section 3 , we outline our formalism for computing these couplings in hbchpt .",
    "a reader already familiar with this formalism may wish to skip to section 4 , where we compute the chiral loop contributions to the nucleon anapole moment through @xmath42 .",
    "we also include the leading @xmath43 terms in the heavy baryon expansion , which generate contributions of @xmath44 .",
    "section 5 contains the vector meson estimate of the chiral counterterms and the determination of the sign , while section 6 gives our numerical estimate of the am contributions to @xmath41 .",
    "we briefly discuss the phenomenology of hadronic and nuclear pv and what that phenomenology may imply about the scale of the unknown low - energy constants .",
    "section 7 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the appendices give a detailed discussion of ( a ) our formalism , ( b ) the full set of hadronic pv lagrangians allowed under su(3 ) symmetry , and ( c ) graphs , nominally present at @xmath1 but whose contributions vanish .",
    "the electron - nucleon parity violating amplitude is generated by the diagrams in figure 2 . at tree level",
    "this amplitude reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 at tree - level in the standard model ( figure 2a ) . here , @xmath49",

    "consequently , the relative importance of the anapole interaction is enhanced by @xmath57 .",

    "what follows , we compute explicityly the various loop contributions up through @xmath1 , while in principle , @xmath63 should be determined from experiment . in section 5 , however , we discuss a model estimate for @xmath63 .    before proceeding with details of the calculation , it is useful to take note of the scales present in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : raanapole ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath40 are generally proportional to a product of strong and weak meson - baryon couplings .",
    "the former are generally of order unity , while the size of weak , pv couplings can be expressed in terms of @xmath64 , the scale of charged current contributions@xcite .",
    "one then expects the am contributions to the axial radiative corrections to be of order @xmath65 in some cases , the pv hadronic couplings may be an order of magnitude larger than @xmath66 . alternatively ,",
    "chiral singularities arising from loops may also enhance the am effects over the scale in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rascale ] ) .",
    "thus , as we show below , the net effect of the am is anticipated to be a 10 - 20 % contribution to @xmath58 .",
    "since much of the formalism for hbchpt is standard , we relegate a detailed summary of our conventions to appendix a. however , some discussion of the effective lagrangians used in computing chiral loop contributions to @xmath40 is necessary here .",

    "@xmath313 all lead to nonzero contribution to @xmath45 .",
    "as noted in section iv , the amplitudes of figures 4 - 6 vanish through @xmath314 .",
    "below , we briefly summarize the reasons behind this result .      in the case where the @xmath71 enters as an intermediate state we have the feynman diagrams shown in figure 4 . since the final and initial states are both nucleons , the two - pion parity violating vertices in eqs",
    "( [ d1])-([d3 ] ) arise first at two - loop order and contribute to the nucleon anapole moment at the order of @xmath316 .",
    "although the pv @xmath317 interactions nominally contribute at lower order , in this case such contributions vanish up to @xmath42 .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "each of the parity violating and cp conserving single pion vertices has the same lorentz structure@xmath318 . in the heavy baryon expansion ,",
    "the relevant vertices are obtained by the substitution @xmath319 , which vanishes .",
    "the leading nonzero contribution arises at first order in the @xmath43 expansion .",
    "consequently , its contribution to the nucleon anapole moment appears only at @xmath320 , and since in this work we truncate at @xmath42 , the pv @xmath315 vertices do not contribute .",
    "the nucleon has a large isovector magnetic moment .",
    "we thus consider associated possible pv chiral loop corrections which lead to a nucleon anapole moment .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in figure 5 . at @xmath321",
    "there are only four relevant diagrams figures 5a - d .",
    "since the magnetic moment is of @xmath322 and the strong pion baryon vertex is of @xmath323 , the remaining pv vertex must be a yukawa coupling if the loop is to contribute at @xmath1 or lower . for the nucleon magnetic moment insertion",
    "we have , for example , @xmath324_+   \\int { d^dk\\over ( 2\\pi)^d }   { k^\\sigma\\over v\\cdot k } { 1\\over v\\cdot ( q+k)}{1\\over k^2-m_\\pi^2   + i\\epsilon } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath325 is the photon polarization vector and @xmath326 is the nucleon magnetic moment .",
    "the denominator of the integrand in ( [ pp ] ) is nearly the same as for @xmath327 .",
    "the numerator contains a single factor of @xmath328 .",
    "hence , figures 5a and 5b vanish for the same reason as does @xmath327 .    for the nucleon delta transition magnetic moment",
    "insertion we have @xmath329\\\\   & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\times \\int { d^dk\\over ( 2\\pi)^d }   { k_\\mu \\over v\\cdot k } { 1\\over v\\cdot ( q+k)}{1\\over k^2-m_\\pi^2 + i\\epsilon } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath330 is the nucleon delta transition magnetic moment and @xmath331 is the spin @xmath332 projection operator in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation framework . since the integrand is the same as in @xmath327 the integral is proportional to @xmath333 .",
    "moreover , @xmath334 , so that @xmath335 . finally , the @xmath71 magnetic insertions of figures 5e - h require the pv @xmath317 vertex , which starts off at @xmath336 .",
    "thus , the latter do not contribute up to @xmath1 .",
    "in short , none of the magnetic insertions contribute at the order to which we work in this analysis .",
    "another possible source to the nucleon anapole moment arises from the pv magnetic moment like insertions as shown in figure 6 .",

    "( [ d4 ] ) start off with one pion , so they are of order @xmath339 .",
    "vertices @xmath340 have two pions and are order @xmath341 .",
    "the corresponding contributions to the nucleon anapole moment appear at order of @xmath342 or @xmath343 , respectively .",
    "the leading pv @xmath338 vertices @xmath126 do not have pions and are of the order @xmath344 . in our case , however , the final and initial states are both nucleons .",
    "the @xmath71 can appear as the intermediate state inside the chiral loop , which leads to an additional factor @xmath345 from two strong vertices .",
    "in the end @xmath126 contributes to the nucleon anapole moment at @xmath342 .",
    "finally , the pv @xmath346 vertices contain one @xmath69 .",
    "since the @xmath71 can only appear as an intermediate state , this vertex contributes at two - loop order and is of higher - order in chiral counting than we consider here ( the corresponding diagrams are not shown ) .",
