    "the proposal that black holes may have formed in the early universe , which are called primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , has recently been extensively studied in cosmology because they can convey unique information about the early universe to us .",
    "this is because energy scales relevant to pbhs are generally very different from those of the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropy .",
    "the possibility of pbhs has been indicated by zeldovich and novikov  @xcite and hawking  @xcite . since pbhs evaporate by emitting radiation and they also act as gravitational sources before they evaporate away , current observations constrain the abundance of pbhs using the big bang nucleosynthesis , extragalactic photon background and gravitational and astrophysical effects of nonevaporating pbhs  @xcite . to convert the observed abundance of pbhs to the information of the early universe , the key issues are the production efficiency of pbhs from given cosmological perturbations and the time evolution of pbhs through mass accretion and hawking evaporation  @xcite .    here , we focus on the criterion of pbh formation . since the probability of pbh formation",
    "is expected to be exponentially small , the abundance of pbhs for given perturbations is sensitive to the formation criterion . as a pioneer , carr  @xcite derived @xmath5 for the equation of state @xmath1 almost in an order - of - magnitude estimate , where @xmath6 is the threshold value of the density perturbation at horizon entry .",
    "this gives @xmath7 for a radiation fluid @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , it turns out that it is not so straightforward to accurately determine the formation criterion of pbhs as we have to understand highly general relativistic nonlinear dynamics in the cosmological background .",
    "recently , numerical relativity has developed so much that the formation of pbhs can be simulated and the threshold of pbh formation can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "shibata and sasaki  @xcite gave the threshold @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is the threshold value of the peak value @xmath10 of the curvature variable @xmath11 and this is consistent with @xmath12  @xcite . polnarev and musco  @xcite gave @xmath13 for a radiation fluid , depending on the perturbation profiles , where @xmath0 is the threshold value of the averaged density perturbation @xmath14 at horizon entry in the comoving slicing in the lowest - order long - wavelength expansion .",
    "musco and miller  @xcite gave @xmath0 for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the pbh formation threshold for a much wider class of initial curvature perturbation profiles characterized by five parameters .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived an analytic formula @xmath16\\sin^{2 } \\left[\\pi\\sqrt{\\gamma-1}/(3\\gamma-2)\\right]$ ] under a certain set of assumptions , which gives @xmath17 for a radiation fluid .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that there is a significant environmental effect on @xmath4 but not on @xmath0 .",
    "very recently , tada and yokoyama  @xcite and young and byrnes  @xcite have found that the pbh production rate is significantly biased if the statistics of the primordial curvature perturbation has small local - type non - gaussianity .    to discuss the pbh formation or any other primordial structure formation",
    ", it is important to give cosmological perturbations which can be generated in the early universe . on the other hand",
    ", the initial data set which will result in pbh formation must nonlinearly deviate from the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe even much before the horizon entry of the scale of the perturbations .",
    "such cosmological primordial perturbations are formulated by lyth _",
    "et al . _",
    "there have been two approaches so far in which the appropriate initial data of cosmological perturbations are prepared and the einstein equations are numerically solved in spherical symmetry to follow the formation of pbhs .",
    "the one is initiated by shibata and sasaki  @xcite and the other is by polnarev and musco  @xcite .",
    "although these two approaches study the same problem , the direct comparison of their results has not been done and for this reason the complete picture of pbh formation has yet been unclear .    in this paper , without assuming symmetry , we construct cosmological long - wavelength solutions which can deviate from the frw spacetimes with an arbitrarily large amplitude and are naturally generated in inflationary cosmology .",
    "these solutions can be applied as the initial data for pbh formation and any other primordial structure formation in spherical symmetry or in nonspherical situations .",
    "nonspherical cosmological perturbations should be particularly important for pbh formation in the stage when the effective equation of state is very soft  @xcite .",
    "such stages have recently been discussed in some scenarios of inflationary cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we explicitly show that the solutions in spherical symmetry reduce to the ones in shibata and sasaki  @xcite in some gauge and to the ones in polnarev and musco  @xcite in another gauge .",
    "thus , we derive the correspondence relation between these two approaches . based on this correspondence relation , we compare the numerical results obtained in these two approaches and find that the results are consistent .",
    "we analyze three different measures of the amplitude of perturbations , @xmath14 , @xmath10 and the maximum value of the compaction function @xmath18 .",
    "the threshold values of these three quantities depend on the initial density ( or curvature ) profiles .",
    "we analyze how the threshold values depend on the profiles and physically understand the dependence using simplified models .",
    "we also discuss an environmental or bias effect on @xmath4 when perturbations are superimposed on perturbations of longer wavelength .",

    "we call the slicing which is orthogonal to the fluid worldlines , namely , @xmath149 , the _ comoving slicing_. this is independent of the comoving threading with which the worldline of the fluid coincides with that of the constant spatial coordinates .",
    "we call the slicing on which the trace of the extrinsic curvature is uniform the _ constant mean curvature ( cmc ) slicing_. although this is sometimes called the uniform - hubble slicing , we here avoid this terminology because of the ambiguity in the definition of the hubble parameter in inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "we call the slicing with @xmath150 the _ geodesic slicing_.    the comoving slicing implies @xmath151 and , hence , @xmath152 .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath60 is vorticity free because of the frobenius theorem .",
    "this condition is physically reasonable in the early universe because the vorticity is not generated from vacuum fluctuation during inflation and because the vorticity is conserved for a perfect fluid in any spacetime .",

    "moreover , the environmental effect on @xmath4 is bounded if the density perturbation of longer wavelength is positive , while @xmath4 even gets smaller than the unperturbed value if the wavelength @xmath488 of the underlying negative density perturbation is sufficiently long and @xmath561 is fixed , and approaches 0 in the limit where @xmath488 is infinitely long .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath4 is common for both the uncompensated top - hat density model and the double top - hat curvature model , in spite of the physical difference between the models .",
    "the threshold values of @xmath4 for the double top - hat curvature model given by eq .",

    "we have constructed cosmological nonlinear perturbation solutions with the long - wavelength scheme in the cmc , uniform - density , comoving and geodesic slicings without assuming symmetry .",
    "these solutions are generated by only a master variable @xmath254 , where the perturbations from the flat frw solution can be arbitrarily large .",
    "we have also derived the explicit relation among these four slicings .",
    "one of the interesting applications is to construct initial data for primordial structure formation with and without spherical symmetry .",
    "for example , we can study nonspherical effects on the pbh formation , which are expected to be important especially for the soft equation of state .",
    "then , we have presented two distinct formulations of spherically symmetric spacetimes and the definitions of mass excess , compaction function and averaged density perturbation as spatial gauge invariant but slicing dependent perturbation quantities .",
    "based on the general formulation of long - wavelength solutions , we have constructed spherically symmetric long - wavelength solutions in the cmc slicing and in the comoving slicing .",
    "we have elucidated the relation between the two spatial coordinates , the conformally flat coordinates and the areal radial coordinates .",
    "using these solutions and relations , we have established the equivalence between the long - wavelength solutions given in shibata and sasaki  @xcite and the asymptotic quasihomogeneous solutions given in polnarev and musco  @xcite , both of which have been used as initial data sets for the simulations of pbh formation .    using this equivalence",
    ", we have reproduced the numerical simulation by shibata and sasaki  @xcite with the numerical code based on the formulation by polnarev and musco  @xcite and obtained the results which agree with the result of shibata and sasaki  @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath4 for the numerical simulation by polnarev and musco  @xcite .",
    "combining these results , we have discussed that the smoother the transition from the overdense region to the frw universe is , the smaller the @xmath0 and @xmath443 become .",
    "the minimum values of @xmath0 and @xmath443 are attained if the transition from the overdense region to the homogeneous universe is the smoothest .",
    "we have discussed that the analytic threshold formula obtained by harada _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite should apply for this case , while the analytic formula for the possible maximum value can be regarded as the threshold value for a sufficiently sharp transition .",
    "we have found the relation among @xmath10 , @xmath18 and @xmath14 by using the compensated top - hat density model and interpreted why @xmath4 shows an apparently opposite behavior within the ( approximately ) compensated models to those of @xmath0 and @xmath562 . moreover , generalizing the top - hat density model to the uncompensated one , we suggest an environmental effect on @xmath4 from the underlying long - wavelength perturbations .",
    "this is also supported by the double top - hat curvature model , which can be treated in a fully analytic and nonlinear manner .",
    "we conclude that even if @xmath0 and @xmath443 are not sensitive to the density profiles in the surrounding region , @xmath4 can be significantly larger ( smaller ) if the density perturbation of the wavelength in which we are interested is in the underlying positive ( negative ) density perturbation of much longer wavelength .",
