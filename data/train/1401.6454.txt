    "several kinds of measurements require the fast displacement and an accurate positioning of prepared samples .",
    "samples need to be displaced from a _ preparation _ region to a _ measurement _",
    "region , which coincides with the vicinity to a sensor head .",
    "this kind of remote detection technique has been used in relaxometry @xcite , dynamical nuclear polarization experiments @xcite , and in low - field- , ultra - low field- , and ( near-)zero - field- nmr spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "sample shuttles are also used in radiological analyses @xcite .",
    "liquid and gaseous samples can be efficiently displaced by means of pumps and pipelines @xcite , while solid samples ( as well as sealed liquid samples ) can effectively be displaced by means of so - called _ rabbit _ systems .    in this note",
    "we describe a home - built pneumatic shuttle capable of moving plastic cartridges containing solid or liquid samples of a few ml in volume along a tube a couple of meters in length .",
    "the transit time is as short as a few tens of milliseconds .",
    "the setup is automatized to facilitate repeated measurements .",
    "a pneumatic method is applied to decelerate the sample , which helps to reduce the shock intensity and to prevent bouncing : important issues for reproducible and precise sample positioning .",
    "specifically , the setup is developed to be coupled with an atomic magnetometer @xcite , which measures the sample s magnetization and its time - evolution .",
    "thus the whole setup enables remote detection of free - induction - decay or relaxometric signals @xcite .",
    "an obvious trade - off exists , demanding a compromise between short displacement time , long distance , and small acceleration and shocks .",
    "in addition , repeated measurements ( such as tens , hundreds or even thousands of cycles ) must be feasible , meaning that materials must be selected carefully in order to reduce surface abrasion and cartridge or tube deterioration .",
    "the sample is enclosed in a plastic cartridge which moves through a transparent plastic tube .",
    "the tube is 2  m in length , while the external and the internal diameters are @xmath025  mm and @xmath119  mm , respectively .",
    "the cartridges are lathed to fit @xmath2 with 0.15  mm tolerance .",
    "fig.[fig : setup ] represents the tube and the schematics of the air connections .",
    "[ htbp ] , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    both fast forward displacement and ( slower ) backward displacement are actuated with an air connection in end a of the tube , while a thin pipeline ( r ) feeds end b with a small air flux , necessary to start the backward motion .",
    "the forward motion of the cartridge ( k ) is activated with a 687  nl / min electro valve ( ev1 ) , through a short connection ( m : 50  cm in length , 8  mm in diameter ) between end a and a reservoir ( t ) , whose 3  litre volume far exceeds the tube volume . a large side hole ( w ) drilled at about 10 centimeters from end b , lets the air escape during the fast forward displacement . after passing w",
    ", the cartridge compresses the small amount of air present in the wb segment of the tube . during this compression , that small amount of air escapes toward the pipeline r , passing through an air - flux control ( h ) , which is adjustable by means of a side - screw .",
    "the size of h is calibrated as so to minimize the energy of the final collision .",
    "in other terms , the cartridge is pneumatically decelerated during the wb displacement . this feature reduces the collision shock and greatly relaxes the requirements in terms of the mechanical strength of the cartridge .    the cylinder ( c ) is slightly lighter than the cartridge and absorbs the small amount of residual energy ( if any ) , losing it on a sorbothane ring ( s ) .",
    "after some calibration work ( selection of the size of h ) the deceleration system described became reliable and reproducible , avoiding significant shocks due to hard k - c collisions and preventing the cartridge from bouncing at end b.    in cycles of measurements , after the detection , the cartridge ( k ) must be moved back to end a. for this purpose a smaller ( 225  nl / min ) electro valve ( ev2 ) is actuated , providing both a small air flux in r and a larger flux to feed the ejector ( e ) .",
    "the air flux passing through r and c pushes k toward w. once k has reached w , the depression produced by the ejector pulls the cartridge back to a , making the system ready for the next cycle .",
    "typical shuttling times are 50  ms for the forward displacement and 1200  ms for the backward one , for a tube of 2  m in length .",
    "the ejector is a home - built , adjustable , aluminium device , the designs for which are available among the supplemental material .",
    "the cycle timing is controlled and verified by means of a data acquisition card driven by a labview code , which will be integrated into the program controlling the magnetometric setup .",
    "two digital outputs are used to activate the electro valves ev1 and ev2 through opto - coupled mosfets , while the analogue signal produced by two photodiodes , detecting the cartridge s passages in two adjustable positions , is analyzed to infer the speed and acceleration of the sample .",
    "the filling pressure of the tank ( t ) is regulated and stabilized to 0.6  mpa , which is a safe value for the tube used , according to the empirical expression for maximum pressure provided by the supplier as : @xmath3  mpa  @xmath4  mpa .    the time to reach different positions along the tube ,",
    "was analyzed to evaluate limiting factors and typical acceleration levels .",
    "the position versus time is plotted in fig.[fig : speeds ] and shows that an abrupt acceleration ( not recorded ) occurs in the first centimeters and continues for about 5  ms , during which the sample moves about 10  cm . a constant speed motion ( steady state ) at a velocity of @xmath5 40  m / s follows . in this time interval the short air connection pipeline ( m ) constitutes an air - flux bottleneck .",
    "this is consistent with a darcy - weisbach @xcite estimate of the pressure loss : @xmath6 comparable to the reservoir pressure .",
    "here @xmath7 is the friction coefficient , @xmath8kg / m@xmath9 is the density of the compressed air , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the pipeline diameter and length , respectively , and @xmath12 is the air velocity in the pipeline",
    ". thus shorter displacement times could be achieved by shortening the m connection or more effectively using a larger diameter @xmath13 for that pipeline .",
    "an experimental check , performed by increasing the length @xmath11 of the pipeline nevertheless showed that other friction phenomena ( most likely involving air layer separating the cartridge surface from the tube wall ) also limit the steady state velocity .",
    "in fact doubling @xmath11 only results in an 8% reduction of the velocity : much less than the 41% decrease that would be expected from eq.[eq : deltap ] .",
    "the fit demonstrates the effectiveness of the pneumatic deceleration in minimizing the shock of the final collision .",
    "[ fig : speeds],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    finally , the pneumatic deceleration occurring in the last part of the tube after the side hole w is clearly evident .",
    "the plot shows its effectiveness in reducing the shock of the final collision .",
    "the deceleration level inferred from the fit is @xmath14  m / sec@xmath15 . with a constant deceleration by this amount ,",
    "the cartridge velocity of 40  m / s is reduced to zero within a 9  cm displacement ( matching the wb distance ) in 4.3  ms .",
    "we tested several kinds of materials for both the cartridges and commercially available tubes , obtaining the best results with a plexiglass tube and nylon cartridges .",
    "other choices gave worse results in terms of cartridge abrasion ( with polyvinyl chloride ) , surface roughness and section ellipticity ( polyethylene tubes ) .",
    "of course further optimization could be achieved by investigating both the materials and production techniques ( roughness and ellipticity ) of the tube . besides aliphatic polyamides ( nylon ) @xcite ,",
    "other good candidates for cartridge material are , for instance , the polyoxymethylene ( delrin ) @xcite and polychlorotrifluoroethylene ( kel - f ) @xcite , all of which were used successfully in the similar setups cited , having been chosen for their mechanical strength .    in spite of the reduced shocks ,",
    "some effort was required to produce rechargeable cartridges suitable for shuttling liquid samples without leaking . to this end ,",
    "a robust screw - sealed design , like the one illustrated in the inset of fig.[fig : setup ] was developed .    as mentioned above , it is important to select shuttle tubes with negligible ellipticity .",
    "in fact , several attempts failed due to this kind of imperfection , which rendered the transfer time unreproducible and the whole system insufficiently reliable , possibly also due to imperfections in the cartridge shape and to its unavoidable and additive rotations .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the fact that no constraints were present to prevent cartridge rotations , we verified that the amount of such rotations is negligible in individual displacements , which is an important issue for certain types of measurement .",
    "the shuttle described is completed by a device for sample magnetization .",
    "we designed and built a cost - effective magnetic assembly suitable for applying a strong and homogeneous premagnetization field , while keeping stray fields and their inhomogeneities at an acceptable level in the detection region , whose distance is determined by the shuttle tube length .",
    "the assembly is based on standard , commercially available nd magnets .",
    "it is sized and shaped in such way as to host end a of the shuttle tube , having a central hole that matches the external diameter of the shuttle tube .",
    "a complete illustration of the shells is available among the supplemental material .",
    "fig.[fig : shells ] shows the aluminium shells used to assemble the magnets in a halbach configuration .",
    "the assembly consists of a two - layer array , each made of 8 cubic magnets , measuring 1  inch per side .",
    "the field in the middle of the central hole ( 25  mm in diameter , 50  mm in length ) was measured as 1.0  t , in accordance with the value estimated based on the strength of the magnets , whose nominal magnetization level is 1.4  t/@xmath16 .",
    "the field along the hole axis ( let this direction , i.e. the shuttle tube axis , be @xmath17 ) only has the transverse ( radial ) components , which decay according to a quadrupolar law .",
    "the measured value of the component parallel to the cube side ( see the inset in fig.[fig : shells ] ) has an amplitude @xmath18 with @xmath19  t  @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting inhomogeneity at a distance of 2  m is @xmath21  328  pt / cm : a value that is easy to compensate @xcite and certainly acceptable for magnetometer operation .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national project firb rbap11zjfa -005 , financed by the italian ministry for education , university and research .",
    "the authors thank e.  thorley of language box ( siena ) for revising the english in the manuscript .",
