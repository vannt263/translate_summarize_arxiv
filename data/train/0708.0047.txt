    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is very successful at describing hadronic scatterings involving very large momentum transfers .",
    "a crucial element in these successes is the asymptotic freedom of qcd @xcite , that renders the coupling weaker as the momentum transfer scale increases , thereby making perturbation theory more and more accurate .",
    "the other important property of qcd when comparing key theoretical predictions to experimental measurements is the factorization of the short distance physics which can be computed reliably in perturbation theory from the long distance strong coupling physics related to confinement .",
    "the latter are organized into non - perturbative parton distributions , that depend on the scales of time and transverse space at which the hadron is resolved in the process under consideration .",
    "in fact , qcd not only enables one to compute the perturbative hard cross - section , but also predicts the scale dependence of the parton distributions .",
    "a generic issue in the application of perturbative qcd to the study of hadronic scatterings is the occurrence of logarithmic corrections in higher orders of the perturbative expansion .",
    "these logarithms can be large enough to compensate the extra coupling constant @xmath1 they come accompanied with , thus voiding the naive , fixed order , application of perturbation theory .",
    "consider for instance a generic gluon - gluon fusion process , as illustrated on the left of figure [ fig : logs ] , producing a final state of momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the two gluons have longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath3 given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the invariant mass of the final state ) and @xmath7 . on the right of figure",
    "[ fig : logs ] is represented a radiative correction to this process , where a gluon is emitted from one of the incoming lines .",
    "roughly speaking , such a correction is accompanied by a factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the momentum fraction of the gluon before the splitting , and @xmath10 its transverse momentum .",
    "such corrections produce logarithms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that respectively become large when @xmath13 is small or when @xmath14 is large compared to typical hadronic mass scales .",
    "these logarithms tell us that parton distributions must depend on the momentum fraction @xmath0 and on a transverse resolution scale @xmath14 , that are set by the process under consideration . in the linear regime , there are `` factorization theorems ''",
    " _ @xmath15-factorization _ @xcite in the first case and _ collinear factorization _",
    "@xcite in the second case  that tell us that the logarithms are universal and can be systematically absorbed in the definition of parton distributions  .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence that results from resumming the logarithms of @xmath16 is taken into account by the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the dependence on the transverse resolution scale @xmath14 is accounted for by the dglap equation @xcite .",
    "the application of qcd is a lot less straightforward for scattering at very large center of mass energy , and moderate momentum transfers .",
    "this kinematics in fact dominates the bulk of the cross - section at collider energies .",
    "a striking example of this kinematics is encountered in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) , when one attempts to calculate the multiplicity of produced particles . there , despite the very large center of mass energy  gev / nucleon ; the lhc will collide nuclei at @xmath17  tev / nucleon .",
    "] , typical momentum transfers are small  gev between gold nuclei at rhic , 99% of the multiplicity comes from hadrons whose @xmath18 is below 2  gev .",
    "] , of the order of a few gevs at most . in this kinematics , two phenomena that become dominant are    * * gluon saturation *  : the linear evolution equations ( dglap or bfkl ) for the parton distributions implicitly assume that the parton densities in the hadron are small and that the only important processes are splittings .",
    "however , at low values of @xmath0 , the gluon density may become so large that gluon recombinations are an important effect . *",
    "* multiple scatterings *  : processes involving more than one parton from a given projectile become sizeable .",
    "it is highly non trivial that this dominant regime of hadronic interactions is amenable to a controlled perturbative treatment within qcd , and the realization of this possibility is a major theoretical advance in the last decade . the goal of these three lectures is to present the framework in which such calculations can be carried out .    in the first lecture",
    ", we will review key aspects of the parton model .",
    "our recurring example will be the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process of scattering a high energy electron at high momentum transfers off a proton .",
    "beginning with the inclusive dis cross - section , we will arrive at the parton model ( firstly in its most naive incarnation , and then within qcd ) , and subsequently at the dglap evolution equations that control the scaling violations measured experimentally .    in the second lecture",
    ", we will address the evolution of the parton model to small values of the momentum fraction @xmath0 and the saturation of the gluon distribution .",
    "after illustrating the tremendous simplification of high energy scattering in the eikonal limit , we will derive the bfkl equation and its non - linear extension , the bk equation .",
    "we then discuss how these evolution equations arise in the color glass condensate effective theory .",
    "we conclude the lecture with a discussion of the close analogy between the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes in qcd and the temporal evolution of reaction - diffusion processes in statistical mechanics .",
    "the third lecture is devoted to the study of nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energy .",
    "our main focus is the study of bulk particle production in these reactions within the cgc framework .",
    "after an exposition of the power counting rules in the saturated regime , we explain how to keep track of the infinite sets of diagrams that contribute to the inclusive gluon spectrum .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate how these can be resummed at leading and next - to - leading order by solving classical equations of motion for the gauge fields the inclusive quark spectrum is discussed as well .",
    "we conclude the lecture with a discussion of the inclusive gluon spectrum at next - to - leading order and outline a proof of high energy factorization in this context . understanding",
    "this factorization may hold the key to understanding early thermalization in heavy ion collisions .",
    "some recent progress in this direction is briefly discussed .",
    "in this lecture , we will begin with the simple parton model and develop the conventional operator product expansion ( ope ) approach and the associated dglap evolution equations . to keep things as simple as possible , we will use deep inelastic scattering to illustrate the ideas in this lecture .",
    "the basic idea of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is to use a well understood lepton probe ( that does not involve strong interactions ) to study a hadron .",
    "the interaction is via the exchange of a virtual photon meson . ]",
    ". variants of this reaction involve the exchange of a @xmath19 or @xmath20 boson which become increasingly important at large momentum transfers .",
    "the kinematics of dis is characterized by a few lorentz invariants ( see figure [ fig : dis_kin ] for the notations ) , traditionally defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nucleon mass ( assuming that the target is a proton ) and @xmath23 the invariant mass of the hadronic final state .",
    "because the exchanged photon is space - like , one usually introduces @xmath24 , and also @xmath25 . note that since @xmath26 , we must have @xmath27  the value @xmath28 being reached only in the case where the proton is scattered elastically",
    ".    the simplest cross - section one can measure in a dis experiment is the total inclusive electron+proton cross - section , where one sums over all possible hadronic final states  : @xmath29 the partial cross - section associated to a given final state @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 } } { 32\\pi^3({\\colorb s}\\!-\\!{\\colorc m_{_n}^2 } ) } ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta({\\colorc p}\\!+\\!{\\colora k}\\!-\\!{\\colora k^\\prime}\\!-\\!{\\colorb p_{_x } } ) \\left < \\left| { \\colord{\\cal m}_{_{\\colorb x } } } \\right|^2 \\right>_{\\rm spin}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 $ ] denotes the invariant phase - space element for the final state @xmath30 and @xmath33 is the corresponding transition amplitude .",

    "the inclusive dis cross - section can be expressed as @xmath38 where the _ leptonic tensor _",

    "thus , the hadronic tensor is the fourier transform of the expectation value of the product of two currents in the nucleon state .",

    "two major experimental results from slac @xcite in the late 1960 s played a crucial role in the development of the parton model .",
    "the left plot of figure [ fig : slac ] shows the measured values of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath0 . even though the data covers a significant range in @xmath52 ,",
    "all the data points seem to line up on a single curve , indicating that @xmath57 depends very little on @xmath52 in this regime .",
    "this property is now known as _",
    "bjorken scaling _ @xcite . in the right plot of figure",
    "[ fig : slac ] , one sees a comparison of @xmath57 with the combination , the longitudinal structure function , describes the inclusive cross - section between the proton and a longitudinally polarized proton . ]",
    "although there are few data points for @xmath59 , one can see that it is significantly lower than @xmath57 and close to zero  ; this relation is known as the _ callan - gross relation _ @xcite . ] .",
    "as we shall see shortly , these two experimental facts already tell us a lot about the internal structure of the proton .      in order to get a first insight into the inner structure of the proton , it is interesting to compare the dis cross - section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis1 ] ) and the @xmath60 cross - section ( also expressed in the rest frame of the muon ) , @xmath61\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : el - mu}\\ ] ] note that , since this reaction is elastic , the corresponding @xmath0 variable is equal to @xmath62 , hence the delta function in the prefactor .",
    "the comparison of this formula with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis1 ] ) , and in particular its angular dependence , is suggestive of the proton being composed of _ point like fermions _  named _ partons _ by feynman  off which the virtual photon scatters .",
    "if the constituent struck by the photon carries the momentum @xmath63 , this comparison suggests that @xmath64 assuming that this parton carries the fraction @xmath65 of the momentum of the proton , i.e. @xmath66 , the relation between the variables @xmath0 and @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , we get  : @xmath69 in other words , the kinematical variable @xmath0 measured from the scattering angle of the electron would be equal to the fraction of momentum carried by the struck constituent .",
    "note that bjorken scaling appears quite naturally in this picture .",
    "having gained intuition into what may constitute a proton , we shall now compute the hadronic tensor @xmath45 for the dis reaction on a free fermion @xmath70 carrying the fraction @xmath65 of the proton momentum .",

    "let us now assume that in a proton there are @xmath73 partons of type @xmath70 with a momentum fraction between @xmath65 and @xmath74 , and that the photon scatters incoherently off each of them .",
    "we would thus have @xmath75 ( the factor @xmath65 in the denominator is a `` flux factor '' . ) at this point , we can simply read the values of @xmath49 , @xmath76 we thus see that the two experimental observations of i ) bjorken scaling and ii ) the callan - gross relation are automatically realized in this naive picture of the proton in this model is intimately related to the spin @xmath77 structure of the scattered partons .",
    "scalar partons , for instance , would give @xmath78 , at variance with experimental results . ] .    despite its success ,",
    "this model is quite puzzling , because it assumes that partons are free inside the proton  while the rather large mass of the proton suggests a strong binding of these constituents inside the proton .",
    "our task for the rest of this lecture is to study dis in a quantum field theory of strong interactions , thereby turning the naive parton model into a systematic description of hadronic reactions . before we proceed further ,",
    "let us describe in qualitative terms ( see @xcite for instance ) what a proton constituted of fermionic constituents bound by interactions involving the exchange of gauge bosons may look like .    in the left panel of figure [ fig : proton ]",
    "are represented the three valence partons ( quarks ) of the proton .",
    "these quarks interact by gluon exchanges , and can also fluctuate into states that contain additional gluons ( and also quark - antiquark pairs ) .",
    "these fluctuations can exist at any space - time scale smaller than the proton size ( @xmath79  1  fermi ) .",
    "( in this picture , one should think of the horizontal axis as the time axis . ) when one probes the proton in a scattering experiment , the probe ( e.g. the virtual photon in dis ) is characterized by certain resolutions in time and in transverse coordinate .",
    "the shaded area in the picture is meant to represent the time resolution of the probe  : any fluctuation which is shorter lived than this resolution can not be seen by the probe , because it appears and dies out too quickly .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : proton ] , the same proton is represented after a boost , while the probe has not changed .",
    "the main difference is that all the internal time scales are lorentz dilated . as a consequence ,",
    "the interactions among the quarks now take place over times much larger than the resolution of the probe .",
    "the probe therefore sees only free constituents .",
    "moreover , this time dilation allows more fluctuations to be resolved by the probe ; thus , a high energy proton appears to contain more gluons than a proton at low energy . ] .",
    "we will now derive bjorken scaling and the callan - gross relation from quantum field theory .",
    "we will consider a theory involving fermions ( quarks ) and bosons ( gluons ) , but shall at first consider the free field theory limit by neglecting all their interactions .",
    "we will consider a kinematical regime in dis that involves a large value of the momentum transfer @xmath52 and of the center of mass energy @xmath80 of the collision , while the value of @xmath0 is kept constant .",
    "this limit is known as the bjorken limit .    to appreciate strong interaction physics in the bjorken limit ,",
    "consider a frame in which the 4-momentum of the photon can be written as @xmath81 from the combinations of the components of @xmath82 @xmath83 and because @xmath84 , the integration over @xmath85 in @xmath45 is dominated by @xmath86 therefore , the invariant separation between the points at which the two currents are evaluated is @xmath87 . noting that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w1 ] ) the product of the two currents can be replaced by their commutator , and recalling that expectation values of commutators vanish for space - like separations , we also see that @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the bjorken limit corresponds to a time - like separation between the two currents , with the invariant separation @xmath89 going to zero , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ope ] .",
    "it is important to note that in this limit , although the invariant @xmath89 goes to zero , the components of @xmath85 do not necessarily become small .",
    "this will have important ramifications when we apply the operator product expansion to @xmath45 .    for our forthcoming discussion ,",
    "consider the forward compton amplitude @xmath90 @xmath91    it differs from @xmath45 by the fact that the two currents are time - ordered , and as illustrated in figure [ fig : compton ] , one can recover @xmath45 from its imaginary part , @xmath92 at fixed @xmath52 , @xmath90 is analytic in the variable @xmath93 , except for two cuts on the real axis that start at @xmath94 .",
    "the cut at positive @xmath93 corresponds to the threshold @xmath95 above which the dis reaction becomes possible , and the cut at negative @xmath93 can be inferred from the fact that @xmath90 is unchanged under the exchange @xmath96 .",
    "it is also possible to decompose the tensor @xmath90 in terms of two structure functions @xmath97  : @xmath98 and the dis structure functions @xmath49 can be expressed in terms of the discontinuity of @xmath97 across the cuts .",
    "we now remind the reader of some basic results about the _ operator product expansion _ ( ope ) @xcite . consider a correlator @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are two local operators ( possibly composite ) and the @xmath102 s are unspecified field operators . in the limit @xmath103 , this object is usually singular , because products of operators evaluated at the same point are ill - defined .",
    "the ope states that the nature of these singularities is a property of the operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and is not influenced by the nature and localization of the @xmath104 s .",
    "this singular behavior can be expressed as @xmath105 where the @xmath106 are numbers ( known as the _ wilson coefficients _ ) that contain the singular @xmath85 dependence and the @xmath107 are local operators that have the same quantum numbers as the product @xmath108 .",
    "this expansion  known as the ope  can then be used to obtain the limit @xmath109 of any correlator containing the product @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath111,and @xmath112 are the respective mass dimensions of the operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 , a simple dimensional argument tells us that @xmath115 . ) from this relation , we see that the operators @xmath116 having the lowest dimension lead to the most singular behavior in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "thus , only a small number of operators are relevant in the analysis of this limit and one can ignore the higher dimensional operators .",
    "things are however a bit more complicated in the case of dis , because only the invariant @xmath89 goes to zero , while the components @xmath85 do not go to zero .",
    "the local operators that may appear in the ope of @xmath117 can be classified according to the representation of the lorentz group to which they belong .",
    "let us denote them @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the `` spin '' of the operator ( the number of lorentz indices it carries ) , and the index @xmath120 labels the various operators having the same lorentz structure .",
    "the ope can be written as  : @xmath121 because they depend only on the 4-vector @xmath85 , the wilson coefficients must be of the form are replaced by @xmath122 , but such terms are less singulars in the bjorken limit . ]",
    "@xmath123 where @xmath124 depends only on the invariant @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , the expectation value of the operators @xmath125 in the proton state can only depend on the proton momentum @xmath2 , and the leading part in the bjorken limit is is replaced by @xmath126 , but they too lead to subleading contributions in the bjorken limit . ]",
    "@xmath127 where the @xmath128 are some non - perturbative matrix elements .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath129 the mass dimension of the operator @xmath130 .",
    "then , the dimension of @xmath124 is @xmath131 , which means that it scales like @xmath132 because the individual components of @xmath85 do not go to zero , it is this scaling alone that determines the behavior of the hadronic tensor in the bjorken limit .",
    "contrary to the standard ope , the scaling depends on the difference between the dimension of the operator and its spin , called its _ twist _",
    "@xmath133 , rather than its dimension alone .",
    "the bjorken limit of dis is dominated by the operators that have the lowest possible twist .",
    "as we shall see , there is an infinity of these lowest twist operators , because the dimension can be compensated by the spin of the operator .",
    "if we go back to the structure functions @xmath97 , we can write @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the difference by one power of @xmath0 ( at fixed @xmath52 ) between @xmath137 and @xmath138 comes from their respective definitions from @xmath90 that differ by one power of the proton momentum @xmath37 .",

    "( [ eq : ope2 ] ) , the functions @xmath139 are in principle calculable in perturbation theory and do not depend on the nature of the target , while the @xmath143 s are non perturbative matrix elements that depend on the target .",
    "thus , the ope approach in our present implementation can not provide quantitative results beyond simple scaling laws .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath137 is even in @xmath0 while @xmath138 is odd ; this means that only even values of the spin @xmath144 can appear in the sum in eq .",

    "we shall now rewrite this equation in a more compact form to see what it tells us about the structure functions @xmath49 .",

    "this contour can then be deformed and wrapped around the cuts along the real axis , as illustrated in the figure [ fig : contour ] . because the structure function @xmath148 is the discontinuity of @xmath149 across the cut ,",
    "we can write @xmath150 therefore , we see that _ the ope gives the @xmath0-moments of the dis structure functions_.    in order to go further and calculate the perturbative wilson coefficients @xmath139 , we must now identify the twist 2 operators that may contribute to dis . in a theory of fermions and gauge bosons ,",

    "the simplest method is to exploit the fact that they are independent of the target .",
    "therefore , we can take as the `` target '' an elementary object , like a quark or a gluon , for which everything can be computed in closed form ( including the @xmath154 ) .",
    "consider first a quark state as the target , of a given flavor @xmath155 and spin @xmath156 . at lowest order",
    ", one has @xmath157 averaging over the spin , and comparing with @xmath158 , we get @xmath159 on the other hand , we have already calculated directly the hadronic tensor for a single quark . by computing the moments of the corresponding @xmath49 , we get the @xmath160 for @xmath144 even  : @xmath161 from this , the bare wilson coefficients for the operators involving quarks are @xmath162 by repeating the same steps with a vector boson state , those involving only gluons are @xmath163 if the vector bosons are assumed to be electrically neutral .",

    "asymptotic freedom_.    as shown by gross , politzer and wilczek in 1973 , non - abelian gauge theories with a reasonable number of fermionic fields ( e.g. qcd with 6 flavors of quarks ) are asymptotically free@xcite and were therefore a natural candidate for being the right theory of the strong interactions .",
    "although it was interesting to see that a free quantum field theory reproduces the bjorken scaling , this fact alone does not tell much about the detailed nature of the strong interactions at the level of quarks and gluons .",

    "this is because in qed , the electro - magnetic potential in the forward light - cone is a pure gauge , that could be made to vanish by a gauge transformation . ] and that the number slightly increases in time afterwards due to the color field present in the forward light - cone .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : quarks ] shows the @xmath465 dependence of the spectrum for various quark masses . as expected , the spectrum is harder for larger quark masses .",
    "note that the tail of the curves is probably affected by important lattice artifacts due to a too coarse lattice .",
    "thus far , we limited ourselves to the leading order contribution for both the gluons and the quarks .",
    "however , we _ a priori _ know from figures [ fig : nbar ] and [ fig : nbar_q ] what diagrams contribute to the gluon and quark multiplicities to all orders . there is therefore a well defined and systematic procedure to compute corrections to the previous results .",
    "loop corrections to gluon production are very relevant for the following reasons :    * they contain terms that are divergent due to unbounded integrals over longitudinal momenta , very similar to the divergences encountered in the derivation of the bk equation .",
    "one should verify whether these divergences can be absorbed in the distributions @xmath513 $ ] and @xmath514 $ ] of the color sources of each projectile .",
    "factorization _ is crucial for the internal consistency of the cgc framework .",
    "* it has been noted recently that the boost invariant solution @xmath445 of the yang - mills equations is unstable@xcite . ] ; rapidity dependent perturbations to this solution grow exponentially in time .",
    "loop corrections generate this kind of rapidity dependent perturbations .",
    "tracking all these terms and resumming them is very important in order to get meaningful answers from the cgc regarding the momentum distribution of the produced gluons , and may be relevant in the problem of thermalization in heavy ion collisions .    note that these two items address very different stages of the collision process .",
    "the first relates to the incoming wavefunctions ( and as such should be independent of the subsequent collision ) , while the second issue is about what happens in the final state after the collision .",
    "therefore , we should aim at writing the 1-loop corrections in a way that separates the initial and final state as clearly as possible .",
    "let us start by listing the relevant diagrams  : the 1-loop corrections to the average multiplicity are shown in the diagrams of figure [ fig : nbar_1loop ] .",
    "the topology on the left is very similar to the one already encountered at tree level , except that one of the blobs has now a loop correction in it .",
    "the topology on the right is new ; but it is in fact similar to what we had to evaluate in the case of the quark spectrum , except that the fermionic cut propagator @xmath484 must be replaced by the cut propagator @xmath515 of a gluon .",
    "the nlo contribution to the gluon spectrum can be written as @xmath516\\ ; . \\label{eq : nlo0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two terms of the first line are the contribution of the diagram on the left of figure [ fig : nbar_1loop ] ( the loop can be in either of the two blobs ) , and the term on the second line comes from the diagram on the right .",
    "the field @xmath517 that appears on the first line is the 1-loop correction to @xmath518 ; and it obeys the linearized equation of motion for small fluctuations .    let us now illustrate how one can separate the initial state from the final state in the term that contains @xmath519 .",
    "first , by analogy with the case of the quarks , we can write @xmath520 where @xmath521 is a small fluctuation of the gauge field on top of @xmath485 , with initial condition @xmath522 when @xmath523 . the equation of motion of this fluctuation is obtained by writing the yang - mills equations for @xmath524 and by linearizing it in @xmath525 . a central formula in order to separate the initial and final states is the following @xmath526\\;{\\cal a}(x)\\ ; , \\label{eq : magic}\\ ] ] where @xmath527 denotes a point located on the light - cone ( @xmath511 ) ( @xmath528 represents any set of three coordinates that map the light - cone . ) in this formula , the classical field @xmath518 is considered as a functional of its initial condition @xmath529 on the light - cone .",

( [ eq : magic ] ) is straightforward in terms of the initial @xmath529 , insert it in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magic ] ) , and check that this leads to the green s formula that relates @xmath534 to its initial condition @xmath535 . ] , but its diagrammatic interpretation is more interesting .    note first that @xmath445 , seen as a functional of its initial condition on the light - cone , can also be represented by tree diagrams , as illustrated in the left panel of figure [ fig : ym - init ] .",
    "( this can be seen from the green s formula for @xmath536 . ) the action of the operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) on the classical field @xmath536 is to replace one of the open dots in figure [ fig : ym - init ] by the fluctuation @xmath535 , represented by a filled dot in the right panel of figure [ fig : ym - init ] . the diagram one gets after this is nothing but a contribution to the propagation of a small fluctuation over the classical field .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : magic ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlo1 ] ) , this quantity becomes @xmath537\\;{\\cal a}^\\mu(x ) \\right ] \\left [ \\big[a^*_{\\lambda^\\prime\\q}(0,\\v)\\cdot { \\bs t}_{\\v}\\big]\\;{\\cal a}^\\nu(y ) \\right]\\ ; . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the brackets are crucial in this formula , in order to limit the scope of the derivatives contained in the operators @xmath538 and @xmath539 .",
    "note that , if it were not for these brackets , the first line and the two @xmath518 s of the second line would be nothing but the lo gluon spectrum .",

    "( [ eq : nlo2 ] ) realizes the separation we were seeking of the initial and final states .",
    "indeed , the operator in the square bracket depends only on what happens below the light - cone , i.e. before the collision . on the contrary ,",
    "the lo spectrum seen as a functional of the initial classical field @xmath518 depends only on the final state dynamics .",
    "the other benefit of this formula is that is expresses the nlo correction as a perturbation of the lo one ; this property  that seems generalizable to other inclusive observables  suggests the universality of the initial state divergences and their factorizability .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlo2 ] ) , it is easy to see what are the potential sources of divergences .",
    "a first issue is that the coefficients @xmath544 and @xmath542 are infinite . for @xmath542 for instance , the integration over the longitudinal component of the momentum @xmath508 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) diverges .",
    "a similar divergence occurs in the loop contained in @xmath541 .",
    "the fact that these divergences arise in the first factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlo2 ] ) indicates that they are related to the evolution of the initial projectiles prior to the collision .",
    "these divergences can be momentarily regularized by introducing cutoffs @xmath545 in rapidity around the rapidity @xmath328 at which the spectrum is calculated .",
    "thus , @xmath544 and @xmath542 become finite but depend on these unphysical cutoffs . to be consistent , the distribution of the sources @xmath464 and @xmath459 should be evolved from the beam rapidities to @xmath360 and @xmath546 respectively .",
    "thus , the complete formula for the lo+nlo spectrum , including the average over the sources , should be @xmath547\\big[d\\rho_2\\big]\\ ; w_{_{y_{\\rm beam}-y_0}}[\\rho_1 ] w_{_{y_{\\rm beam}+y^\\prime_0}}[\\rho_2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\underbrace { \\left[1+\\!\\!\\ !",

    "recall that the lo spectrum in the right hand side is a function of @xmath518 on the light - cone , which is itself a function of @xmath444 .",
    "the factorizability of these divergences in the initial state is equivalent to the independence of the previous formula with respect to the unphysical @xmath360 and @xmath546 .",
    "let us for instance change @xmath360 into @xmath548 .",
    "according to the jimwlk equation , the distribution of @xmath464 is modified by @xmath549\\quad\\to\\quad \\big[1+\\delta y_0{\\cal h}[\\rho_1]\\big]\\;w_{_{y_{\\rm beam}-y_0}}[\\rho_1]\\ ; .\\ ] ] at the same time , the operator in the right hand side varies by @xmath550\\quad\\to\\quad { \\cal o}_{y^\\prime_0}^{y_0}[\\rho_1,\\rho_2 ] + \\delta y_0\\;\\frac{\\partial { \\cal o}_{y^\\prime_0}^{y_0}[\\rho_1,\\rho_2]}{\\partial y_0}\\ ; .\\ ] ] at this point , one can verify that the terms linear in @xmath551 cancel provided that @xmath552}{\\partial y_0 } = { \\cal h}^\\dagger[\\rho_1]\\ ; .\\ ] ] similar considerations on the @xmath546 dependence give another condition  : @xmath552}{\\partial y^\\prime_0 } = - { \\cal h}^\\dagger[\\rho_2]\\ ; .\\ ] ] therefore , in order to check whether one can factorize these divergences in the jimwlk evolution of the incoming sources , one must calculate the coefficients @xmath544 and @xmath542  or at least their divergent part  and remap the operator @xmath553 $ ] into the jimwlk hamiltonian .",
    "although this program has not been fully implemented yet , one can already note that the structure of @xmath553 $ ] makes this outcome very plausible .",
    "( [ eq : nlo2 ] ) also allows us to discuss the issue of the instability of the boost invariant classical solution .",
    "these instabilities manifest themselves in the fact that the action of @xmath554 on @xmath536 diverges when the time @xmath555 goes to infinity .",
    "indeed , @xmath556 is a measure of how @xmath536 is sensitive to its initial condition .",
    "therefore , if the solution @xmath536 is unstable , small perturbations of its initial condition lead to exponentially growing changes in the solution . from the numerical study of these instabilities ( see figure [ fig : insta ] ) , one gets@xcite @xmath557 where @xmath558 is of the order of the saturation momentum .",
    "this means that , although the 1-loop corrections are suppressed by a factor @xmath1 compared to the lo , some of these corrections are enhanced by factors that grow exponentially in time after the collision . at first sight , one may expect a complete breakdown of the cgc description at @xmath559 i.e. the time at which the 1-loop corrections become as large as the lo contribution . the only way out of this conclusion is to resum all these enhanced corrections in the hope that the resummed series is better behaved when @xmath560 . let us assume for the time being that we have performed this resummation , and that the sum of these enhanced terms generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlo2 ] ) to read @xmath561\\;\\frac{d\\overline{n}_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}(0,\\u)]}{dy d^2\\p_\\perp}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath562 $ ] is a certain functional of the operator @xmath554 . in the right hand side",
    ", we have emphasized the fact that the lo spectrum is a functional of the initial classical field on the light - cone .",
    "this formula can be written in a more intuitive way by performing a fourier transform of @xmath562 $ ] , @xmath563\\equiv \\int\\big[da(\\u)\\big]\\ ; e^{i\\int_{\\tau=0^+}d^3\\u\\;\\big[a(\\u)\\cdot { \\bs t}_\\u\\big ] } \\ ; \\widetilde{z}[a(\\u)]\\ ; .\\ ] ] in this formula , the functional integration @xmath564 $ ] is in fact an integration over two fields  : the fluctuation @xmath565 itself and its derivative normal to the light - cone @xmath566 .",
    "thanks to the fact that @xmath538 is the generator of translations of the initial conditions on the light - cone , the exponential in the previous formula is the translation operator itself .",
    "therefore , when this exponential acts on a functional of the initial classical field @xmath567 , it gives the same functional evaluated with a shifted initial condition @xmath568 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath569\\;\\widetilde{z}[a(\\u)]\\ ; \\frac{d\\overline{n}_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}(0,\\u)+a(\\u)]}{dy d^2\\p_\\perp}\\ ; .\\ ] ] we see that the effect of the resummation is simply to add fluctuations to the initial conditions of the classical field , with a distribution that depends on the details of the resummation .",
    "it is easy to understand why these fluctuations are crucial in the presence of instabilities  : despite the fact that they are suppressed by an extra power of @xmath1 , the instabilities make them grow and eventually become as large as the lo .",
    "one can also see that the resummation has the effect of lifting the time limitation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax ] ) . indeed , after the resummation",
    ", the fluctuation @xmath565 has entered in the initial condition for the full yang - mills equation , whose non - linearities prevent the solution from blowing up . a very important question is whether these instabilities fasten the local thermalization of the system formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "if the initial state factorization works as expected , and after the resummation of the leading contributions of the instability , the formula for the gluon spectrum should read @xmath570\\;[d\\rho_2 \\big ] \\;\\ ; { \\colord w_{_{y_{\\rm beam}-y}}[\\rho_1]}\\;{\\colord w_{_{y_{\\rm beam}+y}}[\\rho_2 ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\times \\int\\big[da\\big]\\;{\\colorb\\widetilde{z}[a]}\\ ; \\frac{d{\\colorc\\overline{n}_{_{lo}}}[{\\cal a}(0,\\u){\\colorb + a(\\u ) } ] } { dyd^2\\vec\\p_\\perp } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula resums the most singular terms at each order in @xmath1 . because of their relation to the physics of the initial and final state respectively , the distributions @xmath571 $ ] generalize parton distributions , while @xmath572}$ ] plays a role similar to that of a fragmentation function .",
    "note that , even after the resummations performed in the initial and final states of eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , this formula still suffers from the usual problem of collinear gluon splitting in the final state .",
    "this is not a serious concern in heavy ion collisions though , because collinear singularities occur only when one takes the @xmath560 limit , and we do expect to have to switch to another description ( like hydrodynamics ) long before this becomes a problem .",
    "in fact , the initial condition for hydrodynamics should be specified in terms of the energy - momentum tensor , which is infrared and collinear safe because it measures only the flow of energy and momentum .    a more important problem , that has still not received a satisfactory answer , is to understand how the initial particle spectrum  or the local energy momentum - tensor  become isotropic .",
    "this requires formulating a kinetic theory of the glasma which describes how particles emerge from the decaying classical field and their subsequent interactions both with the classical field and with other particles .",
    "recently , such a kinetic equation has been derived for a scalar field theory coupled to strong sources  @xcite . extending this work to qcd and exploring its consequences- in particular ,",
    "the approach of the particle+field system towards equilibration remains a challenging problem .",
