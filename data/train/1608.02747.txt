    "noble metals , such as au and ag , are typically used as plasmonic materials .",

    "we trace this effect to the near - field energy transfer from the qe to the surface exciton polariton .",

    "in this contribution we have investigated the spectral and distance dependence of the se rate of a qe in the presence of a mos~2~ layer and superlattice .",

    "using the dispersion relation plot , this blue - shift is explained .",
    "it is seen that the number of layers determines the number of branches of the exciton polariton modes available .",
    "the blue - shift of the se rate is connected with the blue - shift of the dispersion line for the mos@xmath3 superlattice , compared with the single layer . for a qe with emission energy corresponding to the peak energy of the se rate for the monolayer , as the number of layers",

    "thus , they can be applied to any of the rest of the tmd family .",
    "furthermore , we have choosen to concentrate on a theoretical investigation of the mos~2~ , and not to fit existing experimental data .",
    "this is due to the fact that the material parameters are strongly influenced by the quality of the material sample itself .",
    "this study made a contribution to explaining all the contradictory results regarding the spectral and distance dependences of qes in the presence of mos~2~ layers .",
    "specifically , we presented a @xmath185 , @xmath1 , distance dependence of the se rate of a qe , which is connected with the lsws at the different emission energies .",
    "also we observed the existence of exciton polariton modes and how they modify the emission properties of qes and the strength of the interaction , where the distance dependence follows the expression @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , we explained that the coupling of a qe with a mos~2~ superlatice depends on its emission energy .",
    "the peak value for the se rate of a qe blue - shifts depending on the number of mos@xmath3 layers , due to the different mode distribution supported by these structures .",
    "while the emission properties of the qe remain the same , the modes provided by the environment change as the number of mos~2~ layers changes . depending on the emission energy of the qe , the se rate can increase or decrease as the number of mos@xmath3 layers is increased .",
    "dielectric screening can explain certain results for certain emission energies of the qe .",

    "combining graphene with tmd layers allows one access to the best of both materials for applications like light harvesting and light emitting devices @xcite . in general the total absorption of these two materials can be further enhanced by including also layers of qes .",
    "the emission properties of the qes can be chosen depending on the nature of the application . for light harvesting devices we need the emission energy of the qes to maximize the non - radiative energy transfer to the mos~2~ layer , where the generated electron - hole pair will be harvested .",
    "on the other hand , for leds we need to maximize the far field emission of the se rate of the qes . both of these effects can be further investigated for devices composed from patterned 2d nanostructures , like ribbons and disks , where the redistribution of the available modes gives rise to sharp resonances @xcite .",
