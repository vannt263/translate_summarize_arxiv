    "the behaviour of planar self - avoiding walks ( saw ) and polygons ( sap ) is one of the classical unsolved problems , not only of algebraic combinatorics , but also of chemistry and of physics @xcite . in the field of algebraic combinatorics , it is a classical enumeration problem . in chemistry and physics , saws and saps",
    "are used to model a variety of phenomena , including the properties of long - chain polymers in dilute solution @xcite , the behaviour of ring polymers and vesicles in general @xcite and benzenoid systems @xcite in particular .",
    "though the qualitative form of the phase diagram @xcite is known rigorously , there is otherwise a paucity of rigorous results .",
    "however , there are a few conjectures , including the exact values of the critical exponents @xcite , and more recently the limit distribution of area and scaling function for saps , when enumerated by both area and perimeter @xcite",
    ".    models of planar polygons with punctures arise naturally as cross - sections of three - dimensional vesicle models . in such cross - sections , there may be holes within holes , and the number of punctures may be infinite . in this work , we exclude these possibilities .",
    "whereas our methods can be used to study the former case , the second situation presents new difficulties , which we have not yet overcome .    in this work we consider the effect of a finite number of punctures in polygon models , in particular we study staircase polygons and self - avoiding polygons on the square lattice .",
    "the perimeter of a punctured polygon @xcite is the perimeter of its boundary ( both internal and external ) while the area of a punctured polygon is the area of the enclosed by the external perimeter minus the area(s ) of any holes . as discussed in section [ sec : punc ] below , the effect of punctures on the critical point and critical exponents of the area and perimeter generating function has been the subject of previous studies , but the effect of punctures on the critical amplitudes and detailed asymptotics have not , to our knowledge , been previously considered .",
    "apart from the intrinsic interest of the problem , we also believe it to be the appropriate route to study the detailed asymptotics of _ polyominoes _ , since punctured polygons are a subclass of polyominoes . while we still have some way to go to understand the polyomino phase diagram",
    ", we feel that restricting the problem to this important subclass is the correct route .",
    "the make - up of the paper is as follows : in the next section we review the known situation for the perimeter and area generating functions of punctured polygons and polyominoes . in section 3",
    "we review the phase diagram and scaling behaviour of staircase polygons and self - avoiding polygons . in section 4",
    "we rigorously express the asymptotic behaviour of models of punctured polygons in the limit of large perimeter in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the model without punctures , by refining arguments used in @xcite .",
    "this leads , in particular , to a characterisation of the limit distribution of the area of punctured polygons .",
    "this result is then used to conjecture scaling functions of punctured polygons .",
    "we consider three cases of increasing generality .",
    "first , we consider the case of minimal punctures .",
    "it is shown that effects of self - avoidance are asymptotically irrelevant , and that elementary area counting arguments yield the leading asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we then discuss the case of a finite number of punctures of bounded size , and finally the case of a finite number of punctures of unbounded size .",
    "results for the latter case are given for models with a finite critical perimeter generating function such as staircase polygons and self - avoiding polygons . whereas the latter two cases are technically more involved , the underlying arguments are similar to the case of minimal punctures . if the critical perimeter generating function of the polygon model without punctures is finite , then all three cases lead , up to normalisation , to the same limit distributions and scaling function conjectures .",
    "the next two sections discuss the development and application of extensive numerical data to test the results of the previous section .",
    "moreover , the numerical analysis yields predictions , conjectured to be exact , for the corrections to the asymptotic behaviour . in particular , section 5 describes the very efficient algorithms used to generate the data , while section 6 applies a range of numerical tools to the analysis of the generating functions for punctured staircase polygons and then punctured self - avoiding polygons",
    "here we wish to emphasise that our work on this problem involved a close interplay between analytical and numerical work .",
    "initially , our intention was to check our predictions for scaling functions by studying amplitude ratios for area moments ( given in table  [ tab : ratios ] ) .",
    "we subsequently discovered numerically the _ exact _",
    "solutions for minimally punctured staircase polygons .",
    "we also obtained very accurate estimates for the amplitudes of staircase polygons with one or two punctures of arbitrary size . from these results we were able to conjecture exact expressions for the amplitudes , which in turn spurred us on to further analytical work in order to prove these results .",
    "the final section summarises and discusses our results .",
    "we consider polygons on the square lattice in this article . in particular , we study self - avoiding polygons and staircase polygons . a self - avoiding polygon on a lattice can be defined as a walk along the edges of the lattice , which starts and ends at the same lattice point , but has no other self - intersections .",
    "when counting saps , they are generally considered distinct up to translations , change of starting point , and orientation of the walk , so if there are @xmath0 saps of length or perimeter @xmath1 there are @xmath2 walks ( the factor of two arising since the walk can go in two directions ) . on the square lattice",
    "the perimeter of any polygon is always even so it is natural to count polygons by half - perimeter instead of perimeter .",
    "the area of a polygon is the number of lattice cells ( times the area of the unit cell ) enclosed by the perimeter of the polygon .",
    "a ( square lattice ) staircase polygon can be defined as the intersection of two mutually avoiding directed walks starting at the same lattice point , moving only to the right or up and terminating once the walks join at a vertex .",
    "every staircase polygon is a self - avoiding polygon .",
    "it is well known that the number @xmath0 of staircase polygons of half - perimeter @xmath1 is given by the @xmath3 catalan number , @xmath4 , with half - perimeter generating function @xmath5 where the connective constant @xmath6 and the critical exponent @xmath7 .",

    "these results of course translate to the singular behaviour of the corresponding generating functions , defined by @xmath20 .    in @xcite guttmann , jensen ,",
    "wong and enting studied square lattice saps with @xmath13 punctures counted by half - perimeter @xmath1 .",
    "they proved the existence of an exponential growth constant @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 . if the corresponding number @xmath23 of saps is assumed to behave asymptotically as @xmath24 they argued , on the basis of a non - rigorous argument , that @xmath25 .",
    "their results also translate to the associated half - perimeter generating function @xmath26 correspondingly .",
    "similar results were obtained for polyominoes enumerated by number of cells ( i.e. area ) with a finite number @xmath13 of punctures @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that an exponential growth constant @xmath27 exists independently of @xmath13 , which satisfies @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the growth constant for saps enumerated by area .",
    "if the number @xmath17 of polynominoes of area @xmath14 with @xmath13 punctures is assumed to satisfy asymptotically @xmath30 it has been shown that @xmath31 and hence that , if the exponents @xmath32 exist , they increase by 1 per puncture .",
    "it was further conjectured on the basis of extensive numerical studies @xcite , that the number @xmath17 satisfies asymptotically @xmath33 notice the conjecture @xmath34 and that the correction terms go down by a whole power .    for unrestricted polyominoes ,",
    "that is to say , with no restriction on the number of punctures , it was proved by guttmann , jensen and owczarek @xcite that the perimeter generating function has zero radius of convergence .",
    "the perimeter is defined to be the perimeter of the boundary plus the total perimeter of any holes .",

    "for that reason , studying punctured self - avoiding polygons was considered a controlled route to attempt to determine the two - variable area - perimeter generating function of polyominoes .    in passing ,",
    "we note that in @xcite the exact solution of the perimeter generating function for staircase polygons with a staircase hole is conjectured , in the form of an @xmath39 order ode .",
    "it is not obvious how to extract particular asymptotic information , notably critical amplitudes from the solution without numerically integrating the ode . in the following",

    "<S> punctured polygons are polygons with internal holes which are also polygons . </S>",
    "<S> the external and internal polygons are of the same type , and they are mutually as well as self - avoiding . </S>",
    "<S> based on an assumption about the limiting area distribution for unpunctured polygons , we rigorously analyse the effect of a finite number of punctures on the limiting area distribution in a uniform ensemble , where punctured polygons with equal perimeter have the same probability of occurrence . our analysis leads to conjectures about the scaling behaviour of the models .    </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse exact enumeration data . for staircase polygons with punctures of fixed size , </S>",
    "<S> this yields explicit expressions for the generating functions of the first few area moments . for staircase polygons with punctures of arbitrary size , a careful numerical analysis yields very accurate estimates for the area moments . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that the leading correction term for each area moment is proportional to the corresponding area moment with one less puncture . </S>",
    "<S> we finally analyse corresponding quantities for punctured self - avoiding polygons and find agreement with the conjectured formulas to at least 34 significant digits .    </S>",
