    "the present paper represents an attempt to understand how the the velocity dependence of the friction force is related to the roughness of the substrate and to the elastic properties of the sliding material .",
    "the role friction plays in our everyday lives , and many technological applications , is immense and yet there still does not exist a successful quantitative theory that explains this phenomena .",
    "the variation of the frictional force with the sliding velocity is interesting in a practical engineering sense where the aim is to control or eliminate friction , but it is also of relevance to workers in a number of other fields .",
    "experimentally , dynamic friction is important in the study of stick - slip motion @xcite , for example . theoretically , friction is relevant , for instance , to models of earthquake faults @xcite and railway wheel squeal@xcite . in such problems a specific form of the velocity dependence of the friction force",
    "is postulated on phenomenological grounds .",
    "the friction law may be nonlocal and nonlinear @xcite , local and nonlinear @xcite or simply local and linear@xcite .",
    "cieplak , smith and robbins@xcite called the linear relationship @xmath0 between velocity @xmath1 and the friction force @xmath2 for _ viscous _ friction in their beautiful study of the microscopic origin of the friction force . if @xmath3 they refer to the behaviour as _",
    "static _ friction .",
    "they found a change from viscous to static friction as the corrugation of the substrate potential is increased .",
    "we believe that this change in velocity dependence is related to the onset of elastic instabilities similar to those described in ref .",
    "when the local curvature of the substrate potential becomes sufficiently large the static force balance equation for the individual atoms supports multiple solutions .",
    "the abrupt jump from one of these solutions to the other leads to a finite dissipation even in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "cieplak et al .",
    "discuss at the end of their paper ref .",
    "@xcite the reason why static friction is more often encountered than static friction .",
    "we suggest that the reason migh be that a slight roughness at the interfaces will produce elastic instabilities and therefore a finite friciton force in the limit of vanishing velocity .",
    "shinjo and hirano have observed friction in a frenkel - kontorova type of model with added kinetic energy terms@xcite .",
    "the friction force they observe in the limit of low velocity is non - zero when the coupling in the system is greater than a critical value , this being the aubry transition point@xcite .",
    "shinjo and hirano also found a vanishing friction force in the limit of high velocity .",
    "their findings imply that elasic instabilities are important for the existence of a finite static friction force .",
    "this is in agreement with the work presented in the present paper .",
    "sokoloff has also made the point that local jumping motion is essential for the occurrence of a dynamical threshold force in a microscopic model of idealized surfaces@xcite .",
    "he suggests that this is probably also applicable to macroscopic surfaces if we think of these surfaces as consisting of two elastic media which interact more strongly at some points on their surfaces than others .",
    "our macroscopic model shows behaviour which is consistent with this idea .",
    "sokoloff has performed simulations which give clear evidence for a transistion from friction free motion to a dissipative regime as function of system size@xcite .",
    "the transition can be understood in terms of chirikov s overlap criterion@xcite .",
    "this criterion states that the frequency of the driving force ( for instance the wash board frequency of the substrate potential ) must overlap with one of the eigenfrequencies of the elastic modes in order for energy to be dissipated into the phonon system .",
    "since the spacing between the eigenfrequencies decreases with increasing system size the overlap criterion is likely to be fulfilled as the size of the system is increased .",
    "this is what sokoloff has demonstrated in fact happens .",
    "the elastic instability induced friction mentioned above can be seen as an alternative mechanism for inducing dissipation .",
    "chirikov - sokoloff resonance mechanism is of dynamical origin , whereas the elastic instability mechanism originates in the possible multivalued character of the static force balance .",
    "a wealth of experimental work has led to the qualitative aspects of friction being well defined ( for a review see @xcite ) . recently",
    ", interest has concentrated on a microscopic description and understanding of the origins the friction force @xcite . experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy ( afm )",
    "@xcite and friction force microscopy ( ffm ) @xcite allow the processes of friction to be studied in three dimensions and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study atomic scale mechanisms of energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "work by sokoloff @xcite has found the velocity dependence of the friction force in a model where the internal degrees of freedom of the moving system are subject to linear damping described by a damping coefficinet @xmath5 .",
    "the obtained velocity dependence of the friction force remains unchanged in the limit of @xmath6 .",
    "we have previously studied the limit @xmath4 . in this limit",
    "we were able to show that in order to calculate the restoring static friction force perturbatively one must expand at least to third order in the random substrate potential @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that a finite static friction force is produced by the existence of non - linear elastic ( or plastic ) instabilities @xcite .",
    "we have studied the effect as well as the statistical properties of these instabilities @xcite . in these studies we assumed that the time evolution was controled by a set of over - damped dynamical equations .",
    "we did not study the mechanisms behind the damping . in the present paper",
    "we attempt to treat the damping in a more realistic maner .",
    "we study an elastic system consisting of a large number of internal degrees of freedom ( light particles ) which do not interect with the external potential .",
    "these degrees of freedom act the heat bath which is able to absorb the energy released during the instabilities",
    ".    in the simplest phenomenological description one assumes some specific functional form for velocity dependence of the friction force .",
    "there are two main classes of behaviour .",
    "these are namely velocity strengthening , where the friction increases with velocity , and velocity weakening , where the opposite occurs , often in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "a simple example of a velocity strengthening friction function is the traditional proportionality assumption @xmath7 .",
    "however , often one observes velocity weakening of the friction force .",
    "velocity weakening and strengthening behaviour have been observed in experiments with cast iron @xcite and recently with rubber against glass @xcite and serpentinite @xcite .",
    "one will expect strengthening to cross over to weakening for large velocities when the interaction time between the individual extremal point of the two sliding surfaces goes to zero .",
    "this is , indeed , what we observe in our simulations .",
    "the specific model we consider is similar to the burridge - knopoff spring - block model@xcite .",
    "this model has been studied recently by several authors@xcite .",
    "our study differs from these investigations in the following important way .",
    "the work in ref .",
    "@xcite assume a specific form for the velocity dependent friction force acting on the individual blocks .",
    "in the present study we use purely newtonian dynamics and study the velocity dependence of the effective friction force produced by dissipation of kinetic energy of the blocks into internal energy of a mechanical heat bath attached to the blocks .",
    "we have the relative motion of two macroscopic bodies in mind .",
    "we imagine the two interfaces to be rough on an atomic scale and focus on the interaction of the asperities reaching out from the two surfaces .",
    "see insert to fig .",
    "1 . for simplicity we model the lower material by a static potential .",
    "the elastic deformations induced in the sliding upper material are captured by the following somewhat oversimplified hamiltonian .",
    "we focus our attention at only two asperities which we represent by two heavy particles of mass @xmath8 and position @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "i.e. the asperities are modeled as stiff bodies .",
    "they interact with a substrate potential @xmath10 .",
    "the induced elastic deformation is represented by the elastic distortion of the bar of eigenfrequency @xmath11 coupling the two particles together .",
    "the heat bath consituted by the phonons in the bulk of the material is represented by an elastic chain of @xmath12 light particles of mass @xmath13 and position @xmath14 coupled to the two heavy particles .",
    "the overall stifness of the material is modelled by the spring of stiffness @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath16 \\label{eqom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the eigenfrequency of the springs connected to the light particles .",
    "we do not include any friction term in the dynamical equation of the model .",
    "the dynamics of the model are directly given by newton s equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and calculated numerically using the leapfrog algorithm @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath21 representing the rough surface is produced by randomly positioning gaussian pinning centres with density @xmath22 along the x - axis .",
    "each individual pinning well @xmath23 has the form",
    "@xmath24    we drive the model by prescribing a centre of mass velocity , @xmath25 which is then kept constant during the simulation .",
    "this is obtained by adjusting the applied force @xmath26 in each time step such that the total force on the system @xmath27 is always kept equal to zero .",
    "the friction froce is identified as the time average of the force @xmath26 .",
    "the average is taken over a time window during which the rate of change of the internal kinetic energy of the heath bath is constant .",
    "this time interval begins after a short transient period after which the kinetic energy of the bath increases linearly with time .",
    "we make sure to stop the measurement before the process becomes non - stationary due to heating of the heat - bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we used the following set of units .",
    "the mass @xmath28 , the length @xmath29 , and time @xmath30 .",
    "a series of constant velocity simulations were carried out using a range of values for the pin amplitude @xmath31 , small spring constant @xmath32 and pin range @xmath33 .",

    "the time step of the discrete numerical integration of the equation of motion were @xmath37 .",
    "all results reported were found after averaging over a number of realizations of the background potential .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effect of elastic instabilities .",
    "let us briefly discuss the nature of these instabilites .",
    "consider a particle of position @xmath38 elastically coupled by a spring of stiffness @xmath39 to a moving coordinate @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a constant velocity . i.e. the elastic energy of the particle is @xmath42 .",
    "let the particle move through a pinning well of the form given in eq .",
    "[ pin - pot ] .",
    "it is easy to show ( see the third paper of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the force balance equation for the particle in the limit @xmath43 will have multiple solutions ( see fig .",
    "2 ) when @xmath44 the particle undergoes discontinous jumps ( in the limit where @xmath45 moves forward quasistatically ) when the solution of the stability equation becomes multi - valued .",
    "the two heavy particles of our model will influence each other during the instabilities .",
    "the condition for instabilities in eq .",
    "[ threshold ] is therefore only approximately applicable to our model .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "3 simulations of the velocity dependence of the friction force for parameters around the threshold value given in eq .",

    "3a presents a set of data for different values of the range of the individual wells and fig .",

    "a change in the behaviour occur for @xmath31 around @xmath47 . in the case where eq .",
    "[ threshold ] predicts the absence of elastic instabilities in the limit @xmath4 one see that the the friction force is an increasing function of the velocity for small velocities .",
    "the intercept with the y - axis vanishes gradualy as the instabilities cease to exist .",
    "this behaviour can clearly be identified despite the difficulties of producing high quality statistics in the limit of vanishing velocity .",
    "( remember that due to the randomness in the position of the pining centres the local curvature can be stronger than the maximum curvature of a single well . )    that a non - zero value of @xmath48 is linked to the existence of elastic instabilities is more clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 . in fig .",
    "4a we show the time dependence of the kinetic energy of the bath as one of the heavy particles moves through a single potential well .",
    "4b shows how the change in the energy of the bath depends on the velocity of the system .",
    "it is unfortunately difficult to simulate the very low velocity limit with high accuracy .",
    "however , one sees that @xmath49 ( the change in the energy of the bath ) can be extrapolated to zero as @xmath4 when @xmath50 .",
    "the above observed behaviour of the friction force can qualitatively be understood in terms of the following simple model .",
    "consider a single particle of position @xmath38 .",
    "let the particle of mass @xmath13 be coupled harmonically , through a spring of stiffness @xmath51 , to a frame which is moving with velocity @xmath1 .",
    "assume furthermore that the particle is in contact with a heat bath which enables a damping propotional to the velocity of the particle to take place .",
    "the interaction with a rough substrate potential is represented by the force @xmath26 . in the frame movng with velocity @xmath1",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath52    we can solve this equation immediately if we replace the position dependent force @xmath53 by a time dependent force @xmath54 .",

    "this is a reasonable approximation for smooth over - damped motion .",

    "this is to be expected since in the lmit of quasi - static motion any non - zero value of @xmath5 will suffice to extract the energy relased during the instabilities .",
    "it is important to remember that the coefficient @xmath76 describing the jump in the substrate force depends implicitly upon the stiffness of the elastic coupling of the moving particle .",
