    "the molecular beam magnetic resonance ( mbmr ) technique has significantly contributed , as is well known , to the development of atomic and molecular physics @xcite . and",
    "it makes possible to measure the larmor frequency of an atom or molecule in the presence of a magnetic field . in the original technique , developed by i.i .",
    "rabi and others @xcite , @xcite the molecular beam is forced to pass through four different fields : a non - homogeneous polarizer field ( a ) where the molecules are prepared . a resonant unit ( c ) that consists of two , a static and an oscillating , fields . a non - homogeneous analyzer field ( b ) .",
    "only molecules in the prepared state reach the detector .",
    "the two non - homogeneous magnetic fields a and b have opposite directions . the molecular beam describes a sigmoidal trajectory and , finally , is collected in a detector ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "typical path of molecules in a m.b.m.r .",
    "the two solid curves show the paths of the molecules whose moments do not change when passing through the resonant cell . ]",
    "rabi explained this effect in terms of spatial reorientation of the angular moment due to a change of state when the transition occurs . in this case",
    "the depletion explanation is based on the interaction between the molecular magnetic dipole moment and the non - homogeneous fields .",
    "@xmath2    the force is provided by the field gradient interacting with the molecular dipolar moment ( electric or magnetic ) . on the resonant unit the molecular dipole interacts with both , homogeneous and oscillating , fields . when the oscillating field is tuned to a transition resonant frequency between two sub states , a fraction of the molecular beam molecules",
    "is removed from the initial prepared state .",
    "the dipolar moment changes in this fraction and as a consequence , the interaction force with the non - homogeneous analyzer field ( b ) . as only molecules in the initial prepared state",
    "reach the detector the signal in the detector diminishes .",
    "during the last years some interesting experimental results have been reported for n@xmath0o , no , no dimer , h@xmath0 and bafch@xmath1 cluster @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the main result consists in the observation of molecular beam depletion when the molecules of a pulsed beam interact with a static electric or magnetic field and an oscillating field ( rf ) as in the rabi s experiments .",
    "but , in these cases , instead of using four fields , only two fields , those which configure the resonant unit ( c ) , are used , that is , without using the non - homogeneous magnetic , a and b , fields . see fig.[fig:2 ]",
    "the dotted line path show the trajectory change of the fraction of the molecular beam that is removed from the initial prepared state when passing through the resonant cell . ]    in a similar way , when the oscillating field is tuned to a transition resonant frequency between two sub states , the fraction of the molecular beam that is removed from the initial prepared state does not reach the detector .",
    "but the important thing is : differently to the previous method , it happens without using non - homogeneous fields . obviously , the trajectory change has to be explained without considering the force provided by the field gradient .",
    "there must be another molecular feature that explains the depletion .",
    "it looks as though the linear momentum conservation principle were not satisfied .",
    "these experiments suggest that a force depending on other fundamental magnitude of the particle , different from mass and charge must be taken into account .      in order to find out an explanation ,",
    "let s consider the following case : an electron is moving , with speed , @xmath3 constant in modulus , in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath4 where @xmath3 is perpendicular to @xmath4 .",
    "its kinetic energy will be :    @xmath5    the electron , as is well known , describes a circular trajectory ( in general case an helix ) with a radius @xmath6 , being : @xmath7 and : @xmath8    due to the lorentz force : @xmath9    on the other hand , as the electron has a magnetic moment , @xmath10 , and spin @xmath11 , the presence of the magnetic field @xmath4 produces a torque when interacting with the electron magnetic moment @xmath10 .",
    "the angle between @xmath11 and o@xmath12 ( the direction of the magnetic field @xmath4 ) remains constant but the spin @xmath11 revolves about o@xmath12 with angular velocity @xmath13 .",
    "this phenomenon bears the name of larmor precession",
    ". the electron kinetic energy must increase with the energy due to spin precession .",
    "but it should be considered that the forces producing the torque are perpendicular to the precession motion and , as a consequence , do not modify the energy of the system .",
    "it looks like if the principle of energy conservation be violated .",
    "if the rotation around an axis is considered as origin of the spin , in a classic ( and impossible ) interpretation , one could imagine the electron rotating in a slowly way and offsetting the increase in energy due to the precession movement .",
    "but , as it is well known , the spin is a quantized quantity ; its modulus is constant and immutable .",
    "this option is , as a consequence , not acceptable .",
    "let us consider now that the helicity is a constant of motion .",
    "helicity , @xmath14 , is defined as the scalar product of linear momentum and the spin : @xmath15    is this hypothesis consistent with quantum mechanics ?",
    "let us consider an electron in a uniform magnetic field @xmath4 , and let us choose the o@xmath12 axis along @xmath4 .",
    "the classical potential energy due to electron magnetic moment @xmath10 is then @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the modulus of the magnetic field .",
    "let us set : @xmath18    @xmath19 being the classical angular precession velocity .",
    "( as is well known , @xmath20 has dimensions of the inverse of a time , that is , of an angular velocity . )",
    "if we replace @xmath21 by the operator @xmath21 the classic energy becomes an operator : the hamiltonian @xmath22 which describes the evolution of the spin of the electron in the field @xmath4 is :    @xmath23    since this operator is time independent , solving the corresponding schr@xmath24dinger equation amounts to solving the eigenvalue equation of h. we immediately see that the eigenvectors of h are those of @xmath21 ( see ref.@xcite ) :    @xmath25    @xmath26    there are therefore two energy levels , @xmath27 and @xmath28 their separation @xmath29 is proportional to the magnetic field and define a _",
    "single bohr frequency _",
    "is it possible to distinguish , in a uniform magnetic field @xmath4 , which electrons are the state @xmath31 and which are the state @xmath32 ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "their behavior inside the field is exactly the same .",
    "but , nevertheless , if we introduce a oscillating magnetic field h@xmath33 with a frequency resonant with the transition @xmath34 , then it will be possible to distinguish both states by the difference in their trajectories , see ref.@xcite .",
    "let us assume that , at time @xmath35 , the spin is in the state : @xmath36    to calculate the state @xmath37 in an arbitrary state @xmath38 and as @xmath39 is already expanded in terms of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian we will obtain :    @xmath40    or , using the values of e@xmath41 and e@xmath42 : @xmath43    the presence of the magnetic field @xmath4 therefore introduces a phase shift , proportional to time , between the coefficients of the kets @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    comparing the expression ( [ eq:14 ] ) for @xmath37 with that for the eigenket @xmath44 for the observable @xmath45    @xmath46",
    "we see that the direction @xmath47 along which the component is @xmath48,with certainty , is defined by the polar angles :    @xmath49    the angle between @xmath47 and o@xmath12 ( the direction of the magnetic field @xmath4 ) therefore remains constant , but @xmath47 revolves around o@xmath12 with angular velocity @xmath50 proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "thus , we find in quantum mechanics the phenomenon equivalent to that described for a particle with classic magnetic moment and spin and which bears the name of larmor precession .",
    "we redefine now the helicity , @xmath14 , in order that its eigenvalues be @xmath511 , as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the initial velocity of the electron is @xmath55 , and we assume the initial spin state of the electron to be an eigenstate of the helicity with eigenvalue + 1 , which is given in ( [ eq12 ] ) , with @xmath56 , that is : @xmath57 at the time @xmath58 the velocity of the electron is , as it is known , @xmath59                                                             \\label{eq:18}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is given in ( [ eq:7 ] ) . according to ( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) , with @xmath56 , at time @xmath58 the spin state is : @xmath60 and the helicity at time @xmath58 , @xmath61 ,    @xmath62                                                             \\label{eq:20}\\ ] ]    now , taking into account that , @xmath63 we easily obtain : @xmath64 this shows that @xmath65 is an eigenstate of the helicity of eigenvalue + 1 ; in other words , helicity is conserved along the electron s ( classical ) trajectory .",
    "it has been proven that helicity is a constant . as a consequence of this result",
    ", the linear momentum @xmath66 must have the same precession angular velocity ( larmor angular velocity ) @xmath13 than the spin @xmath11 .",
    "the equation of motion describing the linear momentum evolution must be then equivalent of the equation of motion which describe the evolution of the spin @xmath11 .",
    "this means that :    @xmath67    @xmath68    it is concluded the particle will be under a central acceleration , @xmath69 perpendicular to @xmath3 . the particle is then under a central force : @xmath70 this kind of forces related with the spin will be designed as lorentz - like forces . in this case , the trajectory will be a circular one .",
    "the radius will be : @xmath71 and its kinetic energy : @xmath72 which is equal to the initial one shown in ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the force ( [ eq:24 ] ) is the responsible of the electron circular trajectory inside the field @xmath4 and should be related to the spin @xmath11 of the electron .      if the case of an electron in a magnetic field is considered , then the force due to the spin of the electron will be :    @xmath73    where @xmath13 is the spin larmor precession velocity around o@xmath12 . but",
    "is known that :    @xmath74    substituting in ( [ eq:24 ] ) the expression for the force acting on the particle is obtained .",
    "this force has its origin on the spin .",
    "this expression is : @xmath75    as for an electron @xmath76 , the final result is : @xmath77    surprisingly this expression for the lorentz - like force , related to the spin , coincide with that known as lorentz force related to the charge . considering the spin as responsible of the lorentz - like force ,",
    "a new deflection mechanism has been proposed ( see ref .",
    "the equations of motion for a system with intrinsic angular momentum when applying torques are described and , according with the theory , when the frequency of the oscillating field coincides with a transition resonant frequency ( larmor frequency ) , the molecules that change their state from the original one are removed from their trajectories and , as a consequence , do not reach the detector and the corresponding signal decreases .",
    "in 1939 alvarez and bloch @xcite measured the neutron magnetic moment by using a neutron beam passing through a resonant unit .",
    "neutrons from the be + d reactions were slowed to thermal velocities and diffused down a cadmium lined tube through the water tank to the polarizer magnet , b@xmath78 . after passing through the resonant unit that consists of two , a static and an oscillating , fields and the analyzer magnet , b@xmath79 they were detected in a bf@xmath1 chamber .",
    "the polarizer b@xmath78 and analyzer b@xmath79 are strongly magnetized iron pieces .",
    "a neutron resonant dip is observed in the signal of the neutron beam when the oscillating resonant frequency corresponding to the transition between the two states up and down is reached . according to the previous theoretical description and recently results obtained for no@xmath0 , no , no dimer , h@xmath0 and bafch@xmath1 cluster ,",
    "if the alvarez and bloch experiment is carried out without using analyzer magnet b@xmath79 , we anticipate that the experimental results will be the same as those obtained by alvarez and bloch in the experiment of 1939 . according to the new explanation",
    ", the trajectory change takes place when neutrons pass through the resonant unit and the oscillating field is tuned to a transition resonant frequency between two states , up and down , of the spin of the neutron . in case of alvarez and bloch experiment , they used a magnetic field for the neutron resonance of 622 gauss and a resonant frequency of oscillator of 1843 kilocycles .",
