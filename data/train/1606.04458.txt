    "the next generation of mobile communication systems ( 5 g ) will most probably encompass various technological innovations , including among others , devices @xcite and multi - hop ( relayed ) transmissions .",
    "it has also been advocated @xcite that security should be extended at the physical layer using , as a complement to traditional computational security , approaches .    in this paper",
    "we focus on solutions for a relay - assisted communication , where both the relay and the destination are devices .",
    "it has already been shown the advantage of cooperation ( relaying ) for physical layer security @xcite , which motivates the focus on this approach .",
    "this scenario arises for example in a cellular 5 g system , where a aims at transmitting a secret message to a , with the assistance of a network relay .",
    "this scenario has been considered in the literature : for example , for relay see @xcite and references therein . in @xcite",
    "an un - authenticated relay was considered ( to be kept in the darkness of the secret message ) , and the destination sent during the source s transmission , and both an upper bound on the secret rate and achievable rates were derived . when the relay is secure , linear precoding schemes can be applied on a transmission with @xcite . relaying and simultaneous jamming by other nodes",
    "has been considered in @xcite where selection of relay and jamming nodes has been addressed .",
    "the case of destination without relaying is considered in @xcite in the absence of on the eavesdropper channel , and in @xcite under various assumptions on the legitimate and eavesdropper channels . the case of a communication between single - antenna devices assisted by a multi - antenna relay",
    "is considered in @xcite , where joint information and jamming beamforming are designed to guarantee secrecy .",
    "a solution for relaying is also considered in @xcite showing the advantages of over network solutions .",
    "the multi - source multi - relay scenario has been considered in various papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) , with and without / and various knowledge of the of the eavesdropper channel , and selection of sources and relays have been optimized . in @xcite a modulo - and - forward is considered for a single relay without eavesdropper , and in the case of no the outage probability is derived . in @xcite a was introduced , and the presence of an eavesdropper was also considered . however the source and destination nodes perfectly know the to the eavesdropper , which is not always a realistic assumption .    in this paper",
    "we consider that both ray and bob are .",
    "since we aim at not revealing information on the secret message to the relay , we consider the . at the same time ray",
    "transmits to confuse eve .",
    "when ray relays the decoded linear combination , alice and bob are transmitting against eve .",
    "with respect to existing literature the innovations of this paper are : a ) bob and ray are devices ; b ) alice , ray and bob transmit also ; and c ) the channel to eve is not known to alice , bob and ray . for this scenario",
    "we derive a bound on the secrecy outage probability . in particular , for the case of rayleigh fading conditions of the channels to eve , we derive a close form expression of the secrecy outage probability bound .",
    "we consider a relay network with a device ( alice ) willing to convey a message to another device ( bob ) , with the help of a relay ( ray ) .",
    "the message must remain secret to a potential passive eavesdropper ( eve ) , whose location ( and even existence ) is unknown to both alice and bob .",
    "ray is always honest , thus he complies with the transmission protocol rules and aims at supporting alice and bob at best .",
    "however , he is curious , i.e. , willing to know the secret message : thus the communication protocol ensures that the message remains secret also to him . in any case ,",
    "eve and ray are not colluding to get information on the secret message .",
    "both alice and eve are assumed to be devices , while both bob and ray have capabilities .",
    "all users are equipped with a single antenna .",
    "the devices have a maximum unitary transmit power , and we assume that each receiver is subject to a zero - mean unitary - power .",
    "extension to the case of devices equipped with multiple antennas is left for future study .",
    "we assume that there is no direct link between alice and bob , therefore the support of ray is needed . among antennas we have flat , reciprocal and channels .",
    "so that the complex channel between users are for the alice / bob - ray channel @xmath0 with x = a or b , and for alice / bob / ray - eve channel @xmath1 with x = a or b or r. since we assume that the relay is curious but honest , we assume that he let alice and bob perfectly know the correct channel gains . on the other hand ,",
    "eve is not honest and we only assume to know the statistics of its channel to both alice and bob .",
