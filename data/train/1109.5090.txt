    "scanning tunneling microscopy techniques ( stm ) have revolutionized @xcite the field of experimental superconductivity for both conventional and high temperature superconductors .",

    "is required to fit the experimental data with a theoretical expression of @xmath5 that includes @xmath4 as a fitting parameter . in principle",
    "this is not an easy task as for many materials the theoretical local density of states @xmath6 is not exactly known or its calculation involves the use of the rather cumbersome eliashberg theory of superconductivity .",
    "however dynes noted @xcite that for some metals the energy gap @xmath7 obtained by a simple fitting function , @xmath8 is in excellent agreement with the one obtained by other experimental techniques .",
    "@xmath9 in ( [ ddos ] ) is other fitting parameter that describes different sources of decoherence . in light of this success",
    "this procedure is now employed to obtain the energy gap in stm experiments involving a broad range of conventional and high @xmath10 superconductors . in case of a material with a non s - wave order parameter symmetry the dynes ansatz",
    "is modified to account for the expected momentum dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "+ in this letter we investigate the limit of applicability of ( [ ddos ] ) in nano - scale superconductors where deviations from mean - field predictions are well documented @xcite .",
    "these were recently used in @xcite to analyze stm data from pb superconducting nano particles .",
    "we focus on sizes @xmath12 nm for which deviations from mean - field predictions start to be relevant . first we introduce a model capable to describing thermal fluctuations and provide theoretical expressions for the gap and @xmath5 .",
    "then we fit this @xmath5 by dynes ansatz ( [ ddos]),([didv ] ) and compare the resulting gap with ( [ spagap]).finally we propose a generalization of dynes ansatz that broadens the information obtained from stm experiments .",
    "in order to test dynes procedure in the nanoscale we study the reduced bcs hamiltonian by path integral techniques in the static path approximation ( spa ) @xcite which provide a good description of thermal fluctuations in the zero dimensional limit corresponding to grain sizes much smaller than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "here we only present the main results and refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the partition function @xmath13 is given by , @xmath14 with @xmath15 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the one particle density of states , @xmath19 is the parition function for non - interacting electrons , @xmath20 is the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath21 is the debye energy and @xmath22 is the mean level spacing . from the explicit knowledge of @xmath13 , the normalized density of states ( dos ) @xmath23 is , @xmath24.\\label{spados}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a phenomenological parameter that describes all decoherence mechanisms except thermal fluctuations .",
    "the superconducting gap @xmath26 in this formalism is given by , @xmath27^{2}\\label{spagap}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath26 leads to the bulk gap @xmath28 for @xmath29 however finite size effects in @xmath26 might differ slightly from those in the spectral gap @xcite .",
    "we now test dynes ansatz by comparing @xmath30 ( [ ddos ] ) with @xmath31 ( [ spagap ] ) where the former is obtained by fitting the theoretical @xmath5 ( obtained from ( [ spados ] ) ) with the dynes @xmath5 coming from ( [ ddos ] ) .",
    "dynes ansatz is presumably applicable provided that the low energy excitations are well defined quasiparticles - fermi liquid theory holds - and a gap do exist in the spectrum such that the quasiparticle dispersion relation is @xmath32 even if @xmath4 is not the bcs prediction . we show in fig .",
    "[ dynes_spa]a that dynes expression fits very well the theoretical @xmath5 and in fig .",
    "[ dynes_spa]b that the energy gap @xmath30 , obtained from ( [ ddos ] ) , is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ spagap ] ) that includes thermal fluctuations . as @xmath22 increases a small difference is observed .",
    "it is therefore likely that , as fluctuations become dominant , ( [ ddos ] ) is less accurate .",
    "it is therefore justified to employ dynes ansatz to fit the experimental @xmath5 in the nanoscale region provided that fluctuations are not dominant @xmath33 . for larger fluctuations the generalized expressions",
    "( [ spados ] ) , ( [ spagap ] ) provides a suitable generalization of dynes expression in the nanoscale where now the fitting parameters are @xmath20 and @xmath34 but @xmath35 since @xmath36 does not include the effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "therefore this generalization of the dynes ansatz allows to single out the effect of fluctuations from other forms of decoherence .",
    "( a ) @xmath5 ( [ didv ] ) as a function of @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "red lines stand for the theoretical @xmath5 from ( [ ddos ] ) and dots correspond to dynes fitting ( [ spados ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath42 , ( b ) the order parameter for the same parameters as in ( a ) .",
    "red lines @xmath43 ( [ spagap ] ) correspond to the spa prediction and black dots @xmath44 stand for dynes fitting , ( c ) @xmath45 for the same parameters as in ( b ) ( see text for more details ) . ]",
    "the analysis of experimental stm data by the spa formalism ( [ spados ] ) , ( [ spagap ] ) developed above has clear advantages over ( [ ddos ] ) even for sizes in which dynes ansatz describes well the energy gap .",
    "we focus on the study of @xmath46 which includes effects leading to a finite quasiparticle life - time and thermal fluctuations as well .",
    "we note that @xmath47 in ( [ ddos ] ) englobes two contributions : @xmath48 where the former accounts for the quasiparticle life time and the latter is related to thermal fluctuations arising due to finite size effects .",
    "it is therefore expected that @xmath49 has a peak around the mean - field critical temperature with a typical width that describes the interval of temperatures where fluctuations are important .",
    "a important drawback of dynes approach is that it is not possible to disentangle these two contributions .",
    "the situation is different if the spa formalism ( [ spados]),([spagap ] ) is employed . here",
    "thermal fluctuations are included so that @xmath50 _ only _ accounts for the finite quasiparticle lifetime .",
    "this is an important difference .",
    "one can quantitatively estimate the role of thermal fluctuations by the quantity @xmath51 which can be obtained by fitting the experimental data by both dynes ansatz ( [ ddos ] ) and the spa expression ( [ spados ] ) .",
    "this quantity has a maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ dynes_spa]c ) near the critical temperature where thermal fluctuations are more important .",
    "therefore it can be used to estimate : a)the importance of thermal fluctuations with respect to other sources of decoherence , b ) the ( would - be ) critical temperature and c ) the region around @xmath10 where fluctuations are relevant .",
    "similar findings are applicable to @xmath52 provided that quantum fluctuations are also included in the theoretical formalism . in summary ,",
    "the use of a theoretical framework that takes into account deviations from mean - field to analyse experimental data expands substantially the information that can be obtained from stm experiments .",
