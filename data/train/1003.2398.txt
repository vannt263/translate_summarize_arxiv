    "microquasars are x - ray binaries which undergo a wide range of physical processes including accretion onto a compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) and the launch of relativistic jets .",
    "ss433 , one of the most studied microquasars , became famous as the first known source of relativistic jets in the galaxy , and it is the only system , x - ray binary or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , for which atomic emission lines have so far been associated with the jets , hence implying a baryonic content ( i.e. , @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the optical spectrum of ss433 is characterised by the presence of numerous broad emission lines with complex profiles , on top of a bright continuum .",
    "as at near - infrared and x - ray wavelengths , these emission lines can be divided into two groups : lines that are referred to as _ stationary _ , albeit highly variable in strength and profile , and lines that are _ moving_. the latter are thought to originate in the two oppositely - directed relativistic jets moving with a speed @xmath9 .",
    "the system ss433 shows four main periodicities : the binary s orbital motion , with a period of about 13.08  days @xcite ; the jet axis precession and nutation , with periods of about 162 and 6  days @xcite , respectively , and a recently discovered 550  day precession of the radio ruff @xcite . a configuration where two jets emerge in opposite directions from the central object @xcite , in which the jet axis undergoes a precession cycle every 162  days was proposed to describe the motion of the emission lines @xcite , and this is referred to as the _ kinematical model_.    the stationary optical and near - infrared spectrum of ss433 is dominated by hydrogen and hei emission lines @xcite and at least 15 per - cent of the flux in the hydrogen lines is contributed by the accretion disc itself @xcite .",
    "the emission - line spectra of accretion discs , and their evolution with orbital and precessional phases , comprise most of the information we can obtain about the temperature and density variations as well as velocity gradients within the disc @xcite .",
    "the balmer decrements of the stationary lines in ss433 have not previously been studied due to the high interstellar extinction towards the object , which makes the detection of the h@xmath1 line rather difficult @xcite .",
    "the decrements are highly dependent on physical parameters of the gas such as its temperature , optical depth and also the nature of the source of radiation @xcite .    the hard radiation field around compact objects and the expected high electron densities for ss433 ( @xmath10  @xmath11 , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : dust ] shows the map of galactic extinction in the direction of the ss433/w50 complex .",

    "it is clear from the image that the @xmath37.8  mag of extinction is consistent with the interstellar absorption gradient .",

    "@xcite fitted the stationary h@xmath0 line profile of their low - resolution spectra using three to four gaussian components .",

    "@xcite carried out decomposition of the h@xmath0 line using higher - resolution data .",
    "they found one broad component ( fwhm  @xmath35  ) whose width was observed to decrease with precessional phase ( i.e. , as the jets become more in the plane of the sky ) identified as the accretion disc wind , and two narrower , red- and blue - shifted , components which were stationary in wavelength , being radiated from a glowing circumbinary ring . in the data presented in that paper , there was no evidence of the accretion disc lines being apparent , in contrast with their persistent appearance in the data presented here .",
    "recently , @xcite were able to model the complex brackett-@xmath36 ( br@xmath36 ) stationary line with usually 5 gaussian components : a broad wind component ( fwhm  @xmath37  ) , two gaussian components accounting for the circumbinary ring and they also found the presence of two components being radiated by matter spiralling in the accretion disc .",
    "the presence of ss433 s accretion disc in the near - infrared line seems to be persistent and their separation implies a circular velocity between 500 and 700  .",
    "we modelled our optical data following a similar approach .",
    "following the analysis done by @xcite , the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 stationary lines were fitted with four gaussian components in order to account for the complexity of the profiles .",
    "although two narrow components have been used in the past to represent the split lines from the circumbinary ring @xcite , because of the low resolution of the spectra we present in this paper ( @xmath3130  ) just one central narrow component was needed to represent the contribution from the circumbinary .",
    "[ fig : examples ] shows examples of fitted profiles .",
    "the presence of a p cygni feature in the stationary lines at certain precessional phases has been noted by several authors @xcite .",
    "an absorption feature in the blue wing of the stationary line profile would indeed complicate the analysis and it would have to be taken into account using models of outflowing winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we detected the p cygni absorption signature at the epochs @xmath38 $ ] and we have excluded these data from our analysis .    the reason why we identify the accretion disc with two separate components representing each peak of the disc s profile is based on the model of emission line formation in accretion discs presented by @xcite , in which the velocity of the outer regions of the disc is represented by half the velocity separation of the line peaks @xcite .",
    "this is caused by the doppler effect and the rotational motion of the matter within the disc .",
    "therefore , the speed with which the radiating material spirals within the accretion disc corresponds to half the difference between the speed at which those lines are moving ( given by the relative position of the peaks ) , under the assumption that the fitted centroids correspond to the tangent speed .",
    "this reveals material that is orbiting in the potential well at speeds of about @xmath39600  ( see blue and red tracks in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] does not reveal a clear signature of the expected motion for the accretion disc centroid and certainly nothing corresponding to the @xcite sinusoidal plot that assumes a circular orbit .",
    "it is not possible to identify what would be the correct phasing of the motion of the disc due to lack of knowledge about the circularity or eccentricity of the orbit . for certain eccentricities , there are not necessarily two well - defined peaks , for example .",
    "a detailed analysis of this problem requires much more long - term monitoring and sophisticated modelling .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] ( left and centre panels ) clearly shows that the accretion disc lines appear slower at orbital phase zero .",
    "this is when the donor star obscures the inner ( faster ) region of the accretion disc .",
    "this is seen most clearly in h@xmath0 .",
    "additionally , there appears to be an episode around mjd  53930 , which corresponds to orbital phase 0.5 , where the accretion disc lines seem to be rotating faster than usual and may simply correspond to a time when we have an unimpeded view into the inner , hence faster , part of the accretion disc .",

    "[ fig : tracks ] shows the evolution of the fwhm of the wind components of the stationary h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines .",
    "this panel also shows that the wind lines appear to get broader at longer wavelengths , which is consistent with previous near - infrared observations of the br@xmath36 line , where the wind component has been reported to be broader than in h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that near the end of the data set we present in this paper , the width of the accretion disc wind attains a velocity of almost 2500  , which translates into a factor 1.7 increase in the 10@xmath40  yr@xmath24 mass - loss rate estimated from recombination line fluxes by @xcite .",
    "modelling of the stationary balmer emission lines , h@xmath0 ( this work and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , h@xmath1 ( this work ) and br@xmath36 @xcite , yields a clear and consistent interpretation of the radiating components present in the ss433 system .",
    "the main components of the system , as inferred from the decomposition of the stationary line complexes , are : a rotating accretion disc , a fast outflowing wind that accounts for most of the mass loss in the system and a circumbinary ring probably being fed from the l2 point .",
    "the moving emission lines from the jets sometimes blend with the stationary ones at around @xmath41 or 0.4 , contributing significantly to the intensity variation and profile shape .",

    "the hydrogen balmer lines show very variable balmer decrements in ss433 .",
    "[ fig : dec ] shows that the computed balmer decrements for the stationary emission - lines scatter from @xmath42  h@xmath5h@xmath1  @xmath43 . in the interpretation of these results we use the calculations carried out by @xcite who modelled the emission - line spectrum from a slab of hydrogen at high densities , by taking into account important mechanisms such as collisional excitation and de - excitation , as well as self - absorption processes .",
    "it is important to chose reasonable temperature and optical depth ( @xmath44 ) parameter values in order to apply their calculations to ss433 .",
    "we mainly utilise the decrements computed for a model with @xmath45  k. for a theoretically - modelled accretion flow , kramer s approximation for the optical depth yields @xmath46 @xcite . since decrements for this exact value are not reported in their paper , we use @xmath47 instead . according to @xcite these ratios ( @xmath42  h@xmath5h@xmath1  @xmath43 ) then imply up to four orders of magnitude variation in density throughout the precession period .",
    "this large inferred variation is not a problem for plausible physical models .",
    "we will analyse and discuss the balmer decrements calculated for each component of ss433 in the following sub - sections .",
    "the balmer line ratios of the components corresponding to the circumbinary excretion disc observed by @xcite are shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dec ] .",
    "they are roughly constant throughout precessional phase with an average value of h@xmath0/h@xmath48 ( 1  @xmath33 scatter ) .",
    "this implies a moderate electron density of @xmath49 , approximately constant throughout the precessional cycle and given the similarity of this balmer decrement to the case b canonical value of @xmath32.8 , this is consistent with no attenuation from the accretion disc wind , in accordance with the _ circumbinary _ nature of this emitting region @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dec ] shows that in the case of the accretion disc wind , the balmer decrements have a very clear precessional phase dependence , showing a clear tendency towards lower electron density ( steeper decrements ) as the jet axis becomes more in the plane of the sky .",
    "this dependence of density on direction is evidence for the polloidal nature of the wind .",
    "the decrement values for the disc wind vary between quite flat h@xmath0/h@xmath50 between precessional phases 0.950.05 and steep h@xmath0/h@xmath51 for phases 0.650.84 .",
    "these values correspond to variations in electron density of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the accretion disc lines are the ones that show the most dramatic and scattered fluctuations in decrement .",
    "both lines , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , show a similar level of scatter .",
    "the average decrement for the red and blue components are h@xmath0/h@xmath54 and h@xmath0/h@xmath55 , respectively .",
    "inverted balmer decrements can be seen at some epochs , implying very high densities and possibly an enhanced inflow of matter from the companion onto the accretion disc .",
    "the decrement of the accretion disc itself appears to be dominated by fluctuations in the instantaneous wind density rather than being dominated by any precessional phase dependence .",
    "a direct consequence of @xcite s @xcite model of the emission line profile formed in an accretion disc is that the emission close to the inner radius of the disc contributes to the outer wings of the double - peaked profile , while the regions nearer the outer radius provide the emission for the peaks ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",

    "the keplerian speed projected onto the plane of the sky is    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the angle between the normal to the disc and our line - of - sight .",
    "the disc is edge - on when this inclination angle is @xmath60 and pole - on when @xmath61",
    ". in our decomposition of the balmer lines profiles , the keplerian velocity of the gas at the outer radius @xmath62 of the disc is given by half the separation between the peaks of the two gaussian components representing the accretion disc , while the keplerian velocity of the gas closer to the disc inner radius @xmath63 corresponds to half the separation between the red wing of the red - shifted component and the blue wing of the blue - shifted component ( see hatched area in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] ) .    the most suitable epoch to measure the inner and outer radii of the accretion disc",

    "<S> we present optical spectroscopy of the microquasar ss433 covering a significant fraction of a precessional cycle of its jet axis . </S>",
    "<S> the components of the prominent stationary h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines are mainly identified as arising from three emitting regions : ( i ) a super - eddington accretion disc wind , in the form of a broad component accounting for most of the mass loss from the system , ( ii ) a circumbinary disc of material that we presume is being excreted through the binary s l2 point , and ( iii ) the accretion disc itself as two remarkably persistent components . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disc components move with a keplerian velocity of @xmath2   in the outer region of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> a direct result of this decomposition is the determination of the accretion disc size , whose outer radius attains @xmath38  in the case of keplerian orbits around a black hole mass of 10  . </S>",
    "<S> we determine an upper limit for the accretion disc inner to outer radius ratio in ss433 , @xmath4 , independent of the mass of the compact object . </S>",
    "<S> the balmer decrements , h@xmath5h@xmath1 , are extracted from the appropriate stationary emission lines for each component of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the physical parameters of the gaseous components are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the circumbinary ring decrement seems to be quite constant throughout precessional phase , implying a constant electron density of @xmath6 for the circumbinary disc . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disc wind shows a larger change in its decrements exhibiting a clear dependence on precessional phase , implying a sinusoid variation in its electron density @xmath7 along our line - of - sight between 10 and 13 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence of density on direction suggests that the accretion disc wind is polloidal in nature .    </S>",
