    "however , minisuperspaces , unlike rpm s , have more specific and gr - inherited potentials and indefinite kinetic terms .",
    "thus both minisuperspace and rpm s are valuable in complementary ways as toy models .",
    "some of the strategies toward resolving the problem of time are as follows .",

    "one considers only questions about the universe ` being ' , rather than ` becoming ' , a certain way .",

    "for example , hawking and page s _ nave schrdinger interpretation _",
    "@xcite concerns the ` being ' probabilities for universe properties such as : what is the probability that the universe is large ? flat ?",

    "rpm s are superior to minisuperspace for such a study as they have a notion of localization in space , and more options for well - characterized localization in configuration space through their kinetic terms possessing positive - definite metrics .",
    "\\d ) perhaps instead it is the histories that are primary ( _ histories theory _",
    "there is a records theory within histories theory , and histories decohereing is one possible way of obtaining a semiclassical regime in the first place , making b ) to d ) of particular interest to one of us @xcite .",
    "\\e ) distinct timeless approaches involve _ evolving constants of the motion _",
    "( ` heisenberg ' rather than ` schrdinger ' style qm ) , or _ partial observables _ @xcite",
    "( which are used in loop quantum gravity s _ master constraint program _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some approaches to the problem of time that do _ not _ have an rpm analogue include superspace time ( which requires indefinite configuration spaces ) and third quantization ( which requires field theoretic rather than finite models ) .",
    "we are in the process of building up a reasonable set of rpm models , paralleling e.g. the development of minisuperspace in the early 70 s @xcite , or carlip s work in the 90 s for 2 + 1 gravity @xcite ( see @xcite for yet further useful toy model arenas for problem of time approaches ) . also rpm s serve as a bridge from highly - studied ideas in molecular physics and  mini- and midisuperspace , which may serve to import ideas and tools from the former to the latter .",

    "this is for the choice of plain shapes rather than oriented shapes .",
    "[ i.e. we make the choice of treating each shape and its mirror image as distinct ; in this paper s 4-stop metroland model , this means that we regard the 1,2,3,4 ordering of the particles to be distinct from the 4,3,2,1 one .",
    "the opposite choice gives configuration spaces @xmath64 ( real projective spaces ) , and @xmath65 which are somewhat harder to model . ]",
    "n.b . that the interesting theoretical parallels between gr and rpm s are unaffected by our choice of plain shapes and of low-@xmath7 rpm s",
    "we are presently studying scalefree models as these are more straightforward than models with scale ( though we will need to move on to scaled models as regards reasonably quantum - cosmologically realistic modelling of the semiclassical approach ; note also that scalefree problems occur as a subproblems in models with scale @xcite , so studying these first also makes sense even from this semiclassical quantum cosmological perspective ) .",
    "this paper considers scalefree 4-stop metroland ( the smallest scalefree metroland to have the nontrivialities associated with having 2 physical degrees of freedom , so that one physical quantity can be expressed in terms of another , a feature necessary for records theory s correlations , while semiclassical approaches need at least one h and at least one l , decoherence only makes sense if one thing decoheres another , and so on ) .",
    "additionally , there are indications that 4-stop metroland is simpler than triangleland @xcite ( which also has two physical degrees of freedom and spherical shape space by @xmath66 ) , particularly in the cases with scale and at the quantum level , so that the present paper is useful toward how to subsequently deal with these other more complicated cases . also , many of the present paper s workings readily extend to n - stop metroland .",
    "4-stop metroland and triangleland are both useful preliminaries for studying quadrilateralland , which is the simplest rpm to exhibit a number of geometrical nontrivialities , including some relevant to problem of time approaches and some that are archetypal of 2-@xmath7 problems in ways that triangleland is not .",
    "moreover , 4-stop metroland itself is already suitable for study of various timeless approaches to the problem of time .    in sec 2",
    "we begin with a classical treatment of 4-stop metroland in its reduced form .",
    "we give a tessellation of the shape sphere corresponding to 4-stop metroland s physical interpretation and provide useful and meaningful shape quantities for our study .",
    "we then study 4-stop metroland s equations of motion and its conserved quantities , among which some have angular momentum - like mathematics but are physically dilational rather than angular momenta .",
    "we interpret simple subcases of multiple harmonic oscillator - like potentials solutions using our tessellation and shape quantities , concentrating on the case of two localized and well - separated subsystems that is motivated by our interest in timeless approaches .    in sec 3",
    "we consider time - independent schrdinger equations for these problems , by firstly interpreting their exact and asymptotic solutions against our tessellation .",
    "secondly , we compute expectations and spreads of our shape quantities promoted to quantum - mechanical shape operators .",
    "thirdly , we consider perturbations about the simplest case in which the ` springs ' balance each other out to produce a constant potential and hence spherical harmonics mathematics .",
    "fourthly , we note and apply a number of analogies with molecular physics to our study . we conclude in sec 4 , including discussion of how our model and slightly larger versions thereof can be used as an arena for investigation of a number of problem of time strategies  of which we provide nave schrdinger interpretation examples  and by commenting on  mini- and midisuperspace counterparts of this paper s shape operators .",
    "the unreduced action is given by the srpm case within eq . ( 2 ) further restricted to being in 1-@xmath7 ( so there are no rotations ) and for 4 particles , and so 3 relative separations and thus 3 relative jacobi coordinates , @xmath67 : = 2 = 3_i\\{^i + r^i}^2/2i .",
    "we will find it more convenient to deal with the subsequent physics in terms of @xmath68 the _ mass - weighted _ relative jacobi coordinates [ which are physically the square roots of the partial moments of inertia @xmath69 ( no sum ) ] , and , after variation , their ` _ normalized _ ' counterparts @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath17 the total moment of inertia and @xmath72 .",
    "it will often be convenient to use @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 for the components of @xmath76 .",
    "we take these jacobi coordinates to be , in terms of particle position coordinates , jacobi h - coordinates rather than jacobi k - coordinates ( fig 1 ) with quantum cosmological and records theoretic applications in mind : two equal particle number clusters treated on the same footing , each could model the seed of a galaxy , or be a nontrivial record ( of which we need at least 2 to consider correlations between records ) .",
    "now let us perform some variational manoeuvres on the above action .",
    "it is useful to bear in mind from the outset that our 4-stop metroland s reduced configuration space is @xmath77 and we are trying to bring this out as cleanly as possible by removing extraneous variables and seeking for standard coordinates on this . variation with respect to the dilational auxiliary @xmath40 gives the dilational constraint ( [ lr ] ) , the lagrangian form for which can be rearranged to = -3 _ i r^i^i / 3 _ j\\{r^j}^2 . , and used to eliminate @xmath11 from the action , producing ( 2 ) but with @xmath78 in place of @xmath22 : _ = . \\ { 3\\{^i}^23\\{^j}^2 - \\ { 3^i^i } ^2 } / 2\\{3 \\{^k}^2}^2 [ iaction ] .",
    "then , via the coordinate transformation = ( /^3 ) , = ( ^2/^1 ) , [ var ] ( [ iaction ] ) becomes _ ^2 = \\{^2 + ^2 ^ 2}/2 .",
    "[ tsp ] the coordinate ranges are @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so these are geometrically the standard azimuthal and polar spherical angles on the unit shape space sphere @xmath77 .",
    "inversely , ^1 = , ^2 = , ^3 =",
    ".    thus 4-stop metroland has @xmath81 playing a ( constant ) radius role , and the @xmath82 are cartesian coordinates in the ` surrounding ' euclidean relational space @xmath83 , subject to the on - sphere condition 3 i^i = 3 \\{^i}^2 = \\{}^2 = i , 3 n^i = 3 \\{n^i}^2 = 1 .",
    "[ new19 ] the @xmath76 are then the components of the unit cartesian vector [ @xmath84 in spherical polar coordinates ] .",
    "this should be contrasted with the way the sphere arising in scalefree triangleland @xcite being harder to deal with from the perspective of the ` surrounding ' euclidean relational configuration space , which is @xmath85 .",
    "scalefree triangleland s @xmath86 and @xmath87 are related to the cartesian coordinates of the surrounding relational space not in the above familiar cartesian way , but rather in the less straightforward ` dragt ' way @xcite , corresponding to having to use not @xmath88 but @xmath17 as radial variable .",
    "the following formulae are also useful below :    = n_z , = , = , = , 2= , 2= , [ useful ] and what is ( from the geometrical perspective ) a stereographic radial coordinate , = = . [ rdef ]",
    "we take the jacobi action corresponding to ( [ tsp ] ) , = 2 to be primary . as well as by sec 2.1 s reduction ,",
    "this can be obtained by @xcite considering a natural mechanics in jacobi s geometrical sense @xcite on the space of shapes @xcite .",
    "the ` banal ' conformal invariance of each of the above product - type actions @xmath89 , @xmath90 is useful below in ` passing ' factors between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( which we term ` picking a distinct banal representation ' ) .",
    "the above - given forms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the geometrically - natural ones ( both in the scale - invariant sense and in the sense of having the standard spherical metric on the shape space sphere ) and mechanically - natural in the sense that @xmath26 itself appears in them rather than @xmath26 times some power of the moment of inertia . however , in some applications , ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) coordinates and @xmath93 is useful ; we term this the ` flat banal representation ' as its @xmath22 is flat , and denote it by tilde - ing .",
    "the jacobi h - coordinates in use are better - adapted for ` seeing ' double - double collisions [ see fig 2a ) ] rather than triple collisions ( the opposite is the case for jacobi k - coordinates ) , so that it is useful to preliminarily work out and graphically represent the mechanical interpretations of the various zones of our problem s configuration space of shapes : fig 2 .",
    "this    is of considerable use below in interpreting classical trajectories ( as paths upon this figure ) and classical potentials and quantum - mechanical probability density functions ( as height functions over this figure ) .",
    "spherical polar coordinates about each axis in fig 2 are natural for the study of the corresponding h or k structure .",
    "thus each choice of h- or k - coordinates has a different natural spherical polar coordinate chart .",
    "any two of these natural charts suffice to form an atlas for the sphere ( each goes bad solely at its poles , where its axial angle ceases to be defined ) .",
    "to look extremely close to a pole , one can ` cartesianize ' e.g. after projecting the relevant hemisphere onto the equatorial disc .",

    "@xmath317 has two potential wells separated by a barrier and then is capable of tunnelling between the two at the quantum level ( like an umbrella inverting in the wind ) .",
    "our model for @xmath310 is similar to this , albeit in spherical polar coordinates : we have 2 polar wells with an equatorial barrier in between .",
    "this analogy then gives us some idea about how the separate solutions for the two wells compose .",
    "for @xmath317 , one can start with separate solutions for each well and additional degeneracies ensue ( due to the wells being identical and being able to distribute some fixed energies between these in diverse ways ) .",
    "however the wavefunctions tend to perturb each other toward breaking these degeneracies , forming symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions over the two wells @xcite .",
    "firstly , the @xmath310 locally stable small or large regimes are the kind of regimes that are termed ` rotator - like ' in analogy a.2 ) s literature ; both of the so(3 ) quantum numbers ( for us , dilational quantum numbers ) hold good in this regime .",
    "secondly , for @xmath310 one can use analogy b to form a simple picture of putting the small and large @xmath95 approximations together . as d remains a good quantum number for the unapproximated problem , one expects to need the north pole approximation s d and the south pole approximation s d to match and the subsequent perturbations exacted by these two approximations upon each other not to affect d. also , prior to any recombination , one has degeneracies as follows ( call the near - north pole s node - counting quantum number @xmath271 and the near - south pole s @xmath318 ) .",
    "there is the one ground state @xmath319 , then the degenerate pair @xmath320 , and then the degenerate quadruplet @xmath321 or @xmath322 for each of @xmath323 . now",
    "if @xmath271 and @xmath318 match , expectation of relsize(12,34 ) goes to 0 again though the wavefunction s distribution is bimodal about both poles .",
    "if they do not match , relsize(12,34 ) retains some nonzero expectation due to the peaking near the two poles being different in detail .",
    "the flip here , as in @xmath317 , is an inversion , i.e. it reverses the orientation , sending 1,2,3,4 to 4,3,2,1 .",
    "thirdly , analogy a.3 ) is well - known for its raman - type @xmath324 and not @xmath325 selection rule , which parallels our results of sec 3.5 .",
    "analogy a.3 ) has furthermore been studied perturbatively for what for us is the small @xmath310 regime .",
    "this allows us to e.g. check the half - way house results ( [ * * * * * ] , [ * * * ] , [ * * * * ] ) against p 271 - 273 of @xcite .",
    "fourthly , further resources from analogy a.1 ) s references @xcite include analysis of this equation s poles in the complex plane and how it admits a solution in the form of an infinite series in associated legendre functions in the vicinity of @xmath325 and in bessel functions in the vicinity of @xmath326 , as well as how to piece together these different representations .",
    "it is then appropriate to compare results from the expansion in associated legendre functions against our perturbative regime ( this particular working holds regardless of the sign of @xmath244 ) .",
    "thus we find the lowest four cases of ( [ big ] ) to agree with p 1502 - 4 of @xcite , which additionally provides the corresponding wavefunctions which we use to first order in @xmath244 in sec 4.4 to evaluate the nave schrdinger interpretation probabilities for these states model universes being large .",
    "fifthly , one can not really put together our near - polar calculations and our perturbative calculations , because the ",
    "@xmath244 small perturbative condition \" goes a long way toward @xmath152 being small and then only a bit of the wavefunction is near the pole .",
    "our near - polar calculations should be compared , rather , with the asymptotics for @xmath244 large .",
    "analogy a.2 ) s literature covers this for what for us is the @xmath244 large negative ( @xmath327 ) regime , giving , via the analogy , ^ _",
    "+ o(1/ _ ) [ holike ] ( _ / ) \\{\\{}^2\\{}^2\\{|| + 1 } + o(1/ _ ) } as the relevant asymptotic solutions , for @xmath328 .",

    "this is termed a ` harmonic oscillator - like regime '  comparing ( [ holike ] ) and the standard result for the 2-@xmath7 isotropic harmonic oscillator makes it clear why .",
    "d alone is a good dilational quantum number in this regime .",
    "sixthly , the spheroidal equation has led to many hundreds of pages of tabulations @xcite and further numerical work e.g. in @xcite , though the most recent of this states that this study is still open in some aspects .",
    "seventhly , one can furthermore envisage extending analogy a.2 ) to have the further parallel with our model that a rotationally - dislocated molecule in a cubic crystal will have preferred directions in space of approximately the same form as ours are in configuration space .",
    "we do not know if such a study has been done .",
    "finally , we comment that a.3 ) has been extended @xcite to include what for us are @xmath187 , @xmath185 , @xmath21 and @xmath186 terms . for",
    ", what one has more generally is a symmetric polarization tensor @xmath333 such that @xmath334 .",
    "then for the @xmath315 model in a diagonal basis @xmath335 giving the combination -@xmath336 [ a slight improvement of analogy a.3 ) by inclusion of the smaller @xmath337 , and this readily rearranges to the special case of the third form of ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "but for more general groups than just oxygen atoms at each end of the axis ( while still remaining in a diagonal basis ) @xmath338 , giving @xmath339 which is the general case of the second form of ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "moreover , in non - diagonal bases , the off - diagonal elements form extra terms directly analogous to those in ( [ 3more ] ) .",
    "thus there is an extended analogy between our problem and the study of polarization , with 4-stop metroland s jacobi  hooke coefficients forming a configuration space - indexed analogue of the spatial - indexed polarizability tensor .",
    "relational particle models ( rpm s ) benefit from notions of locality and structure that are absent in minisuperspace and are free of many of the technical difficulties of midisuperspace models .",
    "this makes them suitable for testing some of the conceptual aspects of quantum cosmology , and of quantum general relativity ( such as the problem of time ) .",
    "in particular , in this paper we study the rpm of 4 particles in 1-@xmath7  _",
    "4-stop metroland _  in the case without scale , both classically and quantum - mechanically .",
    "we concentrate on the clustering into two particular binary clusters [ of particles \\{12 } and particles \\{34 } ] both by using coordinates that follow this case and imposing a potential term that restricts the physics to being near such a configuration .",
    "this is toward a qualitative conceptual model of the quantum cosmological seeding of structure formation in a semiclassical regime ( paralleling the halliwell  hawking @xcite approach , which is somewhat narrower as a problem of time strategy but has further conceptual and computational applications outside of the problem of time context too ) , and of records theory @xcite .",
    "the counterpart of the current paper s model with scale ( which is harder and in which the current paper s work occurs as a subworking under the shape  scale split ) will be required for some aspects of such a study ( in particular , for a semiclassical treatment with a greater number of parallels to that of gr ) .",
    "this is further work in progress @xcite , though sec 4.24 give a brief account of generalizations of the current paper s model and how these meet additional quantum cosmological and problem of time criteria .",
    "this paper s model has an @xmath77 configuration space and then the mathematics which follows has analogies with the standard axisymmetric sphere and central force problems of ordinary mechanics .",
    "in particular , where a conserved angular momentum occurs in these analogue problems , a conserved relative dilational momentum occurs in our model . [ these both have so(3 ) mathematics , but each has a different physical nature , the two being embraced by our notion of rational momentum which generalizes angular momentum to ratios that do not happen to physically be angles . ] we then interpret some of 4-stop metroland s classical and quantum solutions in cases with harmonic oscillator - like potentials .",
    "the solutions in spherical variables give fairly standard mathematics such as that of the rigid rotor and of the 2-@xmath7 isotropic harmonic oscillator in some of the simpler cases , albeit now these require subsequent interesting and unusual interpretation in terms of the 4-stop metroland problem s mechanical variables .",
    "we deduce this at the level of mass - weighted coordinates by tessellating the shape space sphere by the mechanical interpretation appropriate to 4-stop metroland , which we find to possess the symmetry group of the cube .",
    "further tools we introduce , paralleling basic treatises on the atom , are expectations and spreads of shape operators , to which we can also attribute cosmological analogies .",
    "our shape operators are relsize(12,34 ) : the relative size difference between universe and its \\{12 } , \\{34 } cluster contents , relsize(1,2 ) : the size of the \\{12 } cluster relative to the size of the whole model universe , and its \\{34 } cluster counterpart .",
    "the polar angle @xmath92 itself is an inhomogeneity ratio of the contents of the universe themselves ( i.e. of the two clusters relative to each other ) .",
    "we obtain expectations and spreads for such operators e.g. in ground state and in large quantum number limits .",
    "we consider the very special constant potential case that resides within the harmonic oscillator - like potential models as a particularly structurally homogeneous balance of springs , as well as more general cases treated perturbatively for small differences in spring constitution , asymptotically for large such differences , and in near - polar approximations .",
    "we further benefit from recognizing that the special case with the two clusters of the same spring constitution but the inter - cluster spring is weaker gives an elsewise well - known spheroidal equation , alongside various molecular physics analogies : with @xmath248 , @xmath317 , rotation of molecules in crystals and molecular polarizability ( at least the last of which extends to cases with more general combinations of springs between the four particles ) .",
    "this permits us to tap into substantial mathematical physics results and generally control our particular problem , and is a further example of useful bridges between rpm quantum cosmology models and the physics of molecules ( triangleland rpm with harmonic oscillator - like potentials having already been found to share mathematics with the stark effect for a linear rigid rotor @xcite ) .",
    "the jacobi h- and k - coordinates of fig 1 generalize to cover an increasing variety of ` part h - shaped , part k - shaped ' clusterings ( @xcite may be useful in this respect ) , which are of additional value as less trival models of structure formation and of records theory . for full reduction for scalefree arbitrary - n - stop metroland and the subsequent euler ",
    "lagrange equations in the arbitrary - potential case , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , we now comment that the number and nature of conserved quantities that each of these possesses is tied to the usual so(n  1 ) representation theory , and their physical interpretations extend the present paper s discovery of dilational quantities .",
    "tessellations by physical interpretation are now harder as they both have more pieces and also are more difficult to visualize due to being higher - dimensional .",
    "however , our relative size and contents inhomogeneity shape operators do straightforwardly extend to n - stop metroland .",
    "within each n - stop metroland , one can envisage a tower of special , very special , ...",
    "( very)@xmath341 special problems .",
    "the most special of these in each case has a constant potential and thus gives ultraspherical geodesics classically and the ultraspherical rigid rotor quantum - mechanically ( solved by ultraspherical harmonics @xcite ) , while the next most special of these in each case has ( n  1)-@xmath7 isotropic harmonic oscillator mathematics in its near - polar regime ( solved by a power times a gaussian times an associated laguerre polynomial ) . establishing a perturbative regime about each most special problem",
    "would then appear to be possible e.g. @xcite by recurrence relations of the gegenbauer polynomials @xcite .",
    "one technical difference is that , if one does use conformal operator ordering , then one can no longer use the configuration space being 2-@xmath7 to evoke collapse to laplacian ordering like in sec 3.1 .",
    "however , hyperspheres are of constant curvature and so of constant ricci scalar curvature , so @xmath342 is just a constant , @xmath343 ( our ` @xmath26 has no nonconstant prefactors banal conformal representation ' having the unit sphere as its configuration space ) .",
    "so , even in this case , the sole difference between laplace and conformal ordering ( or any other member of the @xmath344ric(@xmath13 ) family of operators ) is in what is to be interpreted to be the zero of the energy .",
    "we also note that for n = 5 the analogy with the halliwell  hawking scheme is somewhat tighter , as both involve perturbative expansions in @xmath345 ultraspherical harmonics .",
    "finally , the next most special equation unapproximated can also be mapped to the spheroidal equation , so that the fairly standard mathematical physics of that equation continues to be of aid in n - stop metroland .",
    "the configuration spaces for these are cones over the corresponding shape spaces @xcite .",
    "the present paper s advances in the physical understanding of conserved quantities in rpm s have further applications here .",
    "our introduction of shape quantities to be promoted to operators also continues to be relevant here through there being a shape  scale split , so that evaluating shape operators here collapses back to pure shape workings such as the present paper s .",
    "expectation and spread of size ( in close parallel with atomic physics ) will also now be pertinent .",
    "metrolands with scale will now have solid rather than surface analogues of the present paper s ` tessellation by physical interpretation ' technique .",
    "the way in which similarity rpm arises as a subproblem from the shape - scale split of the scaled theory means that the most special harmonic oscillator case and perturbations thereabout survives as a piece of the analysis upon introduction of scale , now partnered by isotropic harmonic oscillators in the size quantity .",
    "this setting with scale is more appropriate as regards both toy - modelling of cosmology in general and in particular to using a semiclassical approach both in the problem of time context and in the halliwell  hawking context .",
    "one of us makes a first sketch at this in the smallest case in @xcite , with other cases to follow in @xcite .",
    "the price to pay in introducing scale is that one no longer has nontrivial constraints in spatially 1-@xmath7 models with which to model some effects due to gr s momentum constraint .",
    "on the long term , one can get around this by passing to spatial dimension @xmath346 .",
    "a first such model is triangleland : the rpm of 3 particles in the plane .",
    "this has a @xmath77 shape space like the present paper s 4-stop metroland model does .",
    "this gives a number of useful insights .",
    "e.g. parts of the present paper parallel @xcite .",
    "even more significantly , because the 4-stop metroland interpretation of the sphere turns out to be more straightforward , the present paper allows for an improved understanding of the less straightforward triangleland case @xcite .",
    "scaled triangleland is harder ; so far we have just provided some classical study for this ( also to be augmented by the present paper s techniques at the classical level in @xcite toward finally providing a quantum study of it in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , triangleland lacks the present paper s nice feature of splitting into two nontrivial subsystems ( of 2 particles each ) , which is a useful nontriviality from the structure formation and records theory perspectives .",
    "studying scaled quadrilateralland ( rpm of 4 particles in the plane ) @xcite would incorporate this feature too .",
    "thus this model would possess a number of midisuperspace s features with the benefit of being technically simpler .",
    "this makes it particularly suitable for the simultaneous investigation of records theory and the semiclassical approach ( which may support each other , and histories theory , to form a more robust combined approach to the problem of time and to quantum cosmology @xcite ) .",
    "quadrilateralland does have a further technical complexity ",
    "its shape space is @xmath347 , which unavoidably involves complex - projective mathematics ( triangleland has @xmath348 but this is well - known to also be @xmath77 ) .",
    "further features for consideration in rpm models involve @xcite a ) oriented shapes  real projective spaces @xmath349 in place of @xmath62 as shape spaces or @xmath350 in place of @xmath63 as shape spaces and the corresponding cones in models with scale and/or b ) ( partial ) particle indistinguishibility by which only pieces of whichever of the preceding spaces would pass to being the configuration spaces .",

    "then , on configuration space , one is in the tetralune described in fig 2 , and the nave schrdinger interpretation gives      example 1 also makes sense for the small - regime special solution .",
    "one now obtains proportionality to @xmath366 to leading order i.e. the same ` ( small)@xmath1 ' factor as in the very special problem but now with an opposing ` @xmath367 ' factor , amounting to the small regime s potential well ( fig 3b ) concentrating the wavefunction near the poles i.e. in the region of the configuration space corresponding to large universes in the above - described sense .    finally ,",
    "also repeating example 1 for the wavefunctions with first order perturbative corrections in @xmath244 included , we now find proportionality to @xmath368 for the ground state , to @xmath369 for d = 1 , d = 0 , and @xmath370 for the d = 1 , d = 1 states .",
    "the signs of these corrections conform with intuition , as ( fig 3a ) @xmath311 corresponds to placing a potential barrier at the poles and a well around the equator , which should indeed decrease the amount of wavefunction there , i.e. making large universes less probable , and vice versa for @xmath310 .",

    "\\3 ) as regards records theory @xcite , the current paper s classical work provides some means of defining a notion of distance on configuration space ( which is quite closely related to the measure problem in cosmology @xcite ) , and a notion of localizability in space .",
    "next @xcite , one would construct notions of information ( alias negentropy ) both at the classical level and at the    quantum level for the problems solved in this paper . in this respect",
    "it is worth noting that qm perturbation theory suffices in order to build an approximate statistical mechanics @xcite . such notions of information include e.g. shannon s , von neumann s , tsallis s @xcite , as well as notions of subsystem information , mutual information and correlation ( such as the covariance for the two clusters in the situation that the present paper centres on ) .",

    ".      another longer - term goal would be to export insights acquired by our program to  mini and midisuperspace ; are there then useful analogues of shape operators for these ( anisotropy operators , inhomogeneity operators ? ) in surveying the literature , we have found , firstly , that kucha and ryan @xcite consider @xmath371 for @xmath372 a reparametrization of one of the anisotropy degrees of freedom @xmath373 in diagonal bianchi ix quantum cosmology .",

    "fourthly , halliwell and hawking @xcite compute the expectation of the anisotropy in temperature of the microwave background ; this has the additional value of being  halfway to midisuperspace \" in that it considers inhomogeneous perturbations about a homogeneous spacetime . as regards inhomogeneous spacetimes , the lematre",
    "bondi solution principally concerns radial scale variables , so it is far more of an analogue to the shape - scale extension of the present paper . while there is not anything as yet that we know about using shape operators at the quantum level for the gowdy universe , e.g. andersson , van elst and uggla @xcite use a form of shape  scale variables at the classical level .",

    "the most usual case is that of so(3 ) , habitually called the rotation group , and also interpretable as the isometry group of the 2-sphere [ more generally , so(p ) is the p - dimensional rotation group and the isometry group of the ( p  1)-sphere ] . in turn , so(3 ) is closely related to su(2 ) ( which is its double cover ) .",
    "the rational momentum viewpoint is more general than the mechanical angular momentum perspective but not the so(p ) one , as fig 6 begins to explain by classifying examples .",
