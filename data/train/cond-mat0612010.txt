    "in this report we address the problem of deciding whether a given closed volume contains tnt content by means of nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements .",
    "nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) signals result from the relaxation of nuclear quadrupole momenta to their original thermal equilibrium position after an initial , high power rf pulse has been applied .",
    "the thermal equilibrium configuration of the nuclear spins is a function of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the quadrupole active nuclei . as a result",
    ", the nqr spectrum is very specific with respect to chemical compounds in the substance involved and can serve as a fingerprint to identify that substance .",
    "because of its high potential value in remote explosive detection , there is renewed interest in nqr  methods for landmine and uxo detection , as well as for securing high risk areas such as airports by non - intrusive means . quite incidentally , nmr and nqr systems have recently also received great attention for their applicability in the fast growing field of quantum information @xcite and state of the art quantum computers are currently based on nmr . in nmr , a high intensity , homogenous magnetic field introduces a preferred axis of quantization and causes the energy levels to undergo a zeeman splitting . in nqr , this splitting is caused by the interaction of the nuclear quadrupole with the electric field gradient .",
    "one would then conjecture that a quantum statistical analysis of the data is optimal @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the macroscopic bulk size and consequently large number of spins necessary for an appreciable signal strength , as well as the far from absolute zero temperature of the sample in realistic conditions , call for a classical statistical approach .",
    "it has been shown that the principle of bayes optimal observation @xcite is effective in both the quantum and classical observation .",
    "if only one kind of measurement is performed , the mathematical analysis will be identical for the quantum and classical cases .",
    "we will introduce both bayes - optimal detection and the popular demodulation technique and show that a comparison of the roc curves indicates that bayes - optimal detection offers a vast improvement over the latter , especially for a very low signal to noise ratio , as in the case of nqr based tnt detection .",
    "the detection of landmines turns out to be an extremely difficult task .",
    "even though more and more landmines are made of plastic , the bulk of landmines is still detected using metal detectors .",
    "the reason for this , is that all landmines contain at least a small amount of metal content in the detonator and the metal detector gives a clear signal that is trusted by field workers . by increasing the sensitivity of the metal detector it is possible to reliably detect landmines .",
    "the problem is that the increased sensitivity will make the metal detector responsive to other metal objects that abound in postwar territory . the large false alarm rate that is accompanied by the increased sensitivity , results on average in 500 to 1000 objects to be wrongly classified as potential mines , for each real mine encountered . the overhead in time , energy and cost , not to mention the high rate of accidental detonation of real landmines as a result of this very high false alarm rate , has spurred the search for a better classification method of the detector signals",
    "this classification is made more difficult by the enormous variety of mines , soil parameters , vegetation and weather conditions .",
    "a possible solution involves the use of nuclear quadrupole resonance techniques .",
    "a necessary condition for the use of nqr , is the presence of a substance with a nuclear quadrupole moment .",
    "an ideal candidate is the naturally stable nitrogen isotope @xmath0 ( with a natural abundance of 99.64 % ) with nuclear spin 1 and corresponding nuclear quadrupole moment .",
    "all known explosives contain @xmath0 so that , in principle , it is possible to detect any non - metallic mine by nqr .",
    "the nqr spectrum for @xmath1 has transitions in the frequency range between 0 and 6 mhz , actual values depending mostly on the electric field gradient tensor , which is primarily determined by the charge distribution of the electrons that bind the nitrogen to the rest of the explosive .",
    "the resulting nqr signal is therefore highly dependent on the chemical structure of the sample , and delivers a potentially very reliable classification with an accompanying very low false alarm rate .",
    "compared with other popular mine detection techniques such as the metal detector and the ground penetrating radar , nqr - based detector performance is not very sensitive with respect to weather conditions . add to this that it is possible to construct a hand held nqr detector , and it seems that nqr is an ideal candidate for explosive detection @xcite . the main challenge for nqr techniques , is the inherently low energy content of the signal , resulting in a very low signal to noise ratio ( snr ) . to improve the snr , many repetitions of the experiment are necessary . rather than just measuring the free induction decay of a single excitation , one can set up an appropriate sequence of rf pulses , and measure the returned echo after each such pulse . in this way we obtain a larger data set from which inferences can be made .",
    "the rate at which repetition is physically informative , is bound from below in a fundamental way by the physical parameters of the relaxation process . the nuclear relaxation is a result of two different mechanisms , called the spin - spin relaxation and the spin - lattice relaxation .",
    "the relaxation time that characterizes the spin - lattice relaxation , denoted @xmath2 , determines the time necessary for the system to regain its original thermal equilibrium state , and gives a bound on how quickly a pulse sequence can be initiated after another .",
    "the spin - spin relaxation time , denoted @xmath3 is indicative of the decoherence as a result of spin - spin interactions and determines the length of the spin echo sequence .",
    "spin - spin relaxation times are generally ( much ) shorter than spin - lattice relaxation times . in practice",
    ", we can apply a pulse sequence of length @xmath3 and repeat this pulse sequence every @xmath4 . for most explosives ,",
    "the relaxation times are short enough so that nqr detection becomes feasible .",
    "unfortunately , about 60% of the landmines contain @xmath5trinitrotoluene ( tnt ) , which has relaxation times that lead to prohibitively long detection times within the operational limits of landmine detection .",
    "it is therefore projected that an nqr based landmine detector will probably serve mainly as a confirmation sensor , i.e. a detector that is employed to decrease the false alarm rate only after a metal detector or a ground penetrating radar system has detected a potential landmine . whether used as a confirmation or as a primary detector , nqr detection efficiency for tnt will benefit from a reduction in the time necessary for reliable detection . because one can not shorten the relaxation parameters of tnt , much effort has gone into cleverly designing the emitted rf pulse and increasing the sensitivity of the receiver . besides these efforts",
    ", it is worthwhile to pursue better signal analytic detection techniques .",
    "it is not feasible to describe the entire quantum - physical state of the landmine , nor would this be interesting .",
    "what causes the nqr signal , is the change in the magnetization along the direction of the solenoid . in the case of @xmath6 , we are dealing with a spin-1 system so that the relevant quantum mechanical subspace is spanned by just three orthogonal vectors .",
    "a full determination of the state in this three - dimensional subspace could , in principle , lead to efficient ( and provable optimal ) strategies for detection and classification of the nqr  signal .",
    "the full characterization of the state in just this three dimensional subspace is not feasible with a single pulse sequence , as is the case for our data here .",
    "however , we do not necessarily need detailed knowledge of the whole state . the mathematical formalism required for optimal distinction between arbitrary quantum states",
    "can easily be simplified to accommodate our limited knowledge about the state .",
    "we will briefly show how quantum operations can serve as a framework to relate the measured quadrature components of the current in the coil to quantum state discrimination tools . in theoretical descriptions of nqr ( das and hahn , @xcite , and @xcite ) , the state of the system",
    "is a classical statistical mixture of pure quantum states , described by a density operator @xmath7 belonging to the class of linear , positive operators that sum to one when they act upon a complete set of eigenvectors . if we consider as system the landmine , its immediate surroundings , and the nqr detector , the detection system can be considered as closed and the dynamics of the total density operator @xmath8 is governed by the unitary evolution that solves the schrdinger equation@xmath9",
    "\\label{evolution}\\ ] ]    here @xmath10 is the initial density operator and @xmath11 with @xmath12 is the nuclear quadrupole hamiltonian , @xmath13 the hamiltonian corresponding to the rf pulse and @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 $ ] is the commutator .",
    "the strength of the quadrupolar hamiltonian depends mainly on the coupling between the electric field gradient ( efg ) and the quadrupolar moment .",
    "the efficiency of the excitation by an rf field depends on the relative orientation between the incident radiation and the efg principal axis frame . because the efg principal axis frame depends on the molecular orientation",
    ", it is not possible to excite all quadrupole levels with the same efficiency in a powder crystalline sample .",
    "a calculation shows that the signal strength resulting from a crystalline powder is approximately only 43% the strength of a signal stemming from a single crystal with the same number of nqr active nuclei @xcite . in absence of the rf pulse , a canonical ensemble of nqr spin-1 systems at temperature @xmath17 ,",
    "is described by a density operator @xmath18@xmath19}=\\frac{1}{z}(1-\\mathcal{h}_{q}/k_{b}t)+o(\\frac{1}{t^{2 } } ) \\label{thermal}\\]]here @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath17 the temperature in kelvin , and @xmath21 the partition function , which acts as a normalization .",
    "the second form for the density operator in thermal equilibrium eq.([thermal ] ) , is generally a good approximation for demining applications , as @xmath22 is small at room temperature in comparison to @xmath12 .",
    "the rf pulse perturbs the thermal equilibrium state @xmath23 and it is the relaxation from this perturbed state to eq.([thermal ] ) , according to eq.([evolution ] ) , that is responsible for the nqr signal that we are interested in .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 is @xmath24 for a period of time , followed by absence of a pulse interaction for another period of time , after which @xmath24 is switched on again , and so on .",
    "the pulse will change the efg , and hence the coupling strength of the quadrupole moment to the efg .",
    "it is usual to approximate this as a series @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 describing the hamiltonians at the time instances @xmath29 the evolution eq.([evolution ] ) can then be formally solved for @xmath7 to yield@xmath30because our data comes from the electron current in the coil , we need a way to connect the state of the mixture of the quadrupole active spins to this current .",
    "the coil used is a faraday detector , and the electron current in the coil is the direct result of the load of the preamplifier connected to the coil and the change of the magnetic flux inside the coil .",
    "the expectation of the magnetization in the direction of the axis of symmetry of the solenoid ( say , the @xmath31-axis ) , is obtained by tracing over the product of the state @xmath32 ( the mixture of quadrupole active spin-1 states ) with the magnetization operator @xmath33 along that spatial axis : @xmath34such a tracing operation , is an example of a so - called _",
    "quantum operation_. a quantum operation offers the most general possible description of an evolution @xcite , and is defined as a mapping @xmath35 that transforms an initial state@xmath36 to a final state @xmath37@xmath38such that there exists a set @xmath39 , called _ operation elements _ ,",
    "@xmath40for which @xmath41 can be written as@xmath42the operations , by definition ( [ operation elements ] ) , satisfy @xmath43 and are hence _ trace - preserving_. important examples of operations that are trace - preserving , are projective measurements , unitary evolutions and partial tracing .",
    "if the quantum operation is a general description of a quantum measurement ( or evolution ) , then to each outcome @xmath44 we associate one member @xmath45 of the collection of measurement operators @xmath46 that act on the state space .",
    "if the state is @xmath7 immediately before the measurement , then the probability that the outcome @xmath47 occurs is @xmath48and the state after the interaction , if @xmath47 occurs , is @xmath49the two most common examples of quantum operations , are unitary transformations ( @xmath50 @xmath51 a unitary transformation ) and von neumann projective measurements ( @xmath52 with @xmath53 a projector on the subspace labelled @xmath54 ) .",
    "many more examples , such as in quantum computation , can be found in @xcite and modern descriptions of quantum experiments , as in @xcite , schroeck . in the latter ,",
    "a set @xmath55 of positive operators satisfying @xmath56 and @xmath57 is used .",
    "quantum operations are also a natural way to describe quantum noise and the evolution of an open system .",
    "the mathematical prescription of a quantum operation arises when one considers the system to be in interaction with an environment , and that together form a closed system , for which eq .",
    "( evolution ) applies . to see how this applies here",
    ", we denote the initial state of the system under investigation by @xmath32 , and the state of the environment ( soil and interfering rf fields ) as @xmath58 then the compound system can be written as a tensor product of those states : @xmath59 following the standard rules of quantum mechanics , the expected mixture @xmath7 is the partial trace over the degrees of the environment of the time evolved state of the closed system:@xmath60it can be shown @xcite that eq .",
    "( [ partial trace ] ) is only slightly more general than eq .",
    "( [ operation representation ] ) , hence @xmath61 can be described as resulting from a quantum operation acting on the system density matrix . depending on whether the system contains tnt or not , the examined system has a density matrix written as @xmath62 or @xmath63 we expect either of two generic types of operation to have occurred:@xmath64here @xmath65 is the resulting mixture that produces the magnetization in the presence of tnt , and @xmath66 is the resulting mixture after the interaction , in absence of tnt .",
    "an optimal detection of tnt , hence entails optimally distinguishing the two quantum states @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "as mentioned above , we do not posses detailed knowledge of the states @xmath67 and @xmath66 in practice , but we have the quadrature components @xmath68 the quadrature components are a result of the change in the magnetization @xmath69 eq.([magnetization ] ) . with @xmath70 the number of turns in a solenoid of area @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the quality factor of the coil , we have@xmath73we",
    "assume the quadrature components are induced by the magnetization in eq.([magnetization ] ) by means of another quantum operation acting on the unknown mixture @xmath32:@xmath74quantum operations are closed under conjunction ; two consecutive quantum operations can always be represented as a single quantum operation .",
    "what we need to distinguish in the laboratory then , is to which type the measured @xmath75 belongs:@xmath76quantum operations can only have the effect of reducing the trace distance , which in turn will increase the minimal bayes risk associated with distinguishing the two situations .",
    "hence bayes optimal detection using the quadrature components induces some loss in detector performance in comparison with the same procedure applied to a reconstruction of the state @xmath77 ; because we skip one quantum operation in eq.(state - potential ) , this would lead to a lower bayes - risk .",
    "in essence , bayes - optimal detection deals with the optimal decision of a hypothesis from a set of mutually exclusive hypotheses . consider the binary decision problem @xmath78if a given set of data is compatible only with one of the two hypotheses , the decision problem becomes trivial .",
    "however , in practice , the data generally supports both hypotheses , albeit with a different probability , and the decision task is consequently complicated by this fact .",
    "if we are given data @xmath79 from a set of possible outcome results @xmath80 and the factual occurrence of @xmath79 supports both hypotheses , we need to infer what the probability was of getting the result @xmath81 as a result of either hypothesis being true .",
    "that is , we need some means to evaluate @xmath82 and @xmath83 any additional ( prior ) information can be included under the label @xmath84 and then we compare @xmath85 and @xmath86 of course , what we are after , is the probability of @xmath87 or @xmath88 being true , on the condition that @xmath84 holds and @xmath79 was the outcome of the experiment . by the use of bayes theorem @xcite , we have @xmath89@xmath90we eliminate the denominator by calculating the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ bayes h0 ] ) and eq . ( [ bayes h1]):@xmath91 in absence of any preference which of the two hypotheses is more likely than the other on the basis of the prior information , we set @xmath92 . in complete absence of any prior information , we omit dependence on @xmath93 the quantity of interest for optimally choosing between two alternative hypotheses , is the likelihood ratio ( also called _ the odds _ in the binary case):@xmath94    we call the observation scheme",
    "_ bayes - optimal _ iff the obtained outcome @xmath79 is the outcome that maximizes the odds , eq.([odds ] ) , that the outcome given , pertains to the system under investigation rather than to noise in the detection system .",
    "it turns out that this is a model for quantum as well as classical observation @xcite . assuming our detector is bayes - optimal , allows for an optimal detection strategy by reversing the logic of the detector",
    "of course , we do not know in advance whether the physical detector satisfies the condition of bayes - optimality , and actual performance will depend on how well this condition will be met . in accordance with quantum mechanics , we assume the probability @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 ) is a monotone function of the trace distance between the actually measured signal , and the ideal ( averaged over many samples ) signal obtained in the presence ( absence ) of tnt .",
    "numerator and denominator in eq.([odds ] ) can be substituted by the corresponding trace distance , as the outcome for which the likelihood ratio is maximal , is invariant under monotone transformations .",
    "a second rationale for taking the trace distance , is that it arises naturally when one considers the bayes risk in the binary state discrimination problem .      if we are given two states @xmath65 and @xmath66 with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath97 and @xmath98 then , following eq .",
    "( [ quantum operation ] ) , we look for two operations elements @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 that minimize the _ bayes risk _ or probability of error @xcite : @xmath102rewriting eq.([bayes risk ] ) once with @xmath103 and once with @xmath104 adding and dividing , yields@xmath105\\]]to proceed , we define the trace distance between @xmath65and @xmath66 , as @xmath106an important property of the trace distance is that it is symmetric in its arguments , positive iff @xmath107 zero iff @xmath108 and satisfies the triangle inequality . in other words",
    ", it is a bona - fide distance measure on the set of density matrices .",
    "another important property of the trace distance , is given by @xmath109with this we can show @xcite that the minimum value the bayes risk @xmath110 can attain does not depend on the @xmath45 and equals @xmath111 in our treatment of the data , each specific sample could equally well contain tnt , or not , so that we have as prior probabilities @xmath97",
    "@xmath112 @xmath113we see the minimal bayes risk is attained for two states that maximize the trace distance .",
    "trace preserving quantum operations can be shown to cause a contraction in the space of density operators @xcite .",
    "because the trace distance is a true distance measure on the space of density operators , it can only decrease as a result of an arbitrary trace - preserving quantum operation @xmath41:@xmath114if the current in the coil is the result of eq .",
    "( [ coil operations ] ) , then being able to distinguish the currents reliably ( i.e. , the trace distance is greater than can be explained from fluctuations ) , indicates we have successfully distinguished the situations represented by @xmath87 and @xmath115quantum operations can only have the effect of reducing the trace distance , which in turn will increase the minimal bayes risk associated with distinguishing the two situations .",
    "hence bayes optimal detection using the quadrature components induces some loss in detector performance in comparison with the same procedure applied to a reconstruction of the state @xmath77 ; because we skip one quantum operation in eq.(state - potential ) , this would lead to a lower bayes - risk .      a popular method to establish the presence of a given substance in a nqr tested sample ,",
    "is the use of the so - called demodulation technique .",
    "this method is particularly simple and consists of calculating an estimate @xmath116 of the power spectral density @xmath117 of the signal @xmath118 @xmath119 by first fast fourier transforming the signal and taking its modulus squared .",
    "let us call @xmath120 the frequency @xmath121 where one expects the spectral line with the highest intensity in presence of tnt .",
    "the value of the _ estimated _ power spectral density @xmath122 evaluated at the frequency @xmath123 is then the test statistic for a treshold detector . if @xmath124 exceeds a given treshold , the presence of tnt is accepted , if not , it is rejected .",
    "the estimated @xmath125 will in general deviate from @xmath117 at the precise values @xmath126 , but may be approximately regarded as an average over the interval @xmath127.$ ] to account for this , sometimes the average under @xmath125 over a few frequency bins is taken as a statistical test parameter .",
    "whether this is useful depends , among other things , on the magnitude of the width of the spectral line with the highest intensity relative to the width of the frequency bins .",
    "moreover , as nqr spectra are generally a function of the temperature of the sample , and because this parameter is difficult to estimate in demining applications within a range of 5 to 10 kelvin , the value of @xmath120 will depend on the temperature too . to make sure we do not miss the peak , one",
    "can then take the area over a region in the frequency domain where one expects the peak .",
    "this complication presents no real problem to the method employed and , however important to the actual demining problem , is not taken into account here ( see , however , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "all our experimental samples are taken at the same temperature .",
    "as expected , we see little change in the efficiency of the method , whether we use @xmath128 or a sum of values @xmath129 for a tiny region surrounding the relevant frequency bin .",
    "however , a considerable improvement is obtained when we allow for the demodulation technique to sample multiple peaks simultaneously . the results that we present here ,",
    "employ the single peak value @xmath122 of the frequency bin containing the mean excitation frequency 841.5 khz , as well as an improved demodulation algorithm exploiting knowledge of three resonance frequencies of tnt within a range of a few tens of khz around the mean excitation frequency 841.5 khz .",
    "the data employed for our analysis was kindly provided by the nqr group of king s college , london , under supervision of professor j.a.s . smith . in the experimental set up employed , a pure monoclinic tnt  sample with a weight typical of that found in an anti - personnel mine ,",
    "is placed inside a solenoidal coil .",
    "the same coil is used for emission of the rf - pulse , as well as for the reception of the subsequent echo .",
    "the returned echo signal is routed through a hardware band - pass filter with a bandwidth of approximately 50 khz and subsequently sent to a tecmag libra spectrometer that splits the signal in two signals which are then mixed with two quadrature components , yielding a complex discrete time series .",
    "because of the ideal laboratory conditions under which the signal has been obtained , the results will compare unrealistically optimistic with respect to those obtained under field conditions .",
    "in particular , the absence of rf interference and the use of a coil that contains the sample in its entirety , must be taken into account when attempting to compare the results of our analysis with those of data obtained under more realistic conditions .",
    "the emitted rf signals are pulsed , spin locked echo signals with a mean excitation frequency of 841.5 khz .",
    "the mean and width of the excitation are such , that 4 spectral lines of tnt  can be detected within the frequency range of the band pass filter .",
    "because the same coil is used for the emission of the rf signal ( which has a mean power of several kilo watts ) , as for the reception of the echo ( which is extremely weak ) , the returned echo contains so - called antenna ringing effects . to cancel the effect of the antenna ringing , a phase cycling technique , popular in the more established field of nmr ,",
    "is employed .",
    "the phase cycling technique requires forming an appropriate sum of four signals .",
    "the signals used for the analysis , are the sum of 5 such phase - cycled sums and hence consist of 20 repeated data acquisitions , averaged to improve signal to noise ratio .",
    "the sampling time is 5@xmath130s and each set has 8192 data points , which consists of 32 sequential echo signals , each containing 256 data points .",
    "the pulse sequence is of the type @xmath131    here @xmath132 denotes the rf pulses and the 1280 @xmath130s of data ( 256 times 5 @xmath130s ) for each echo signal is acquired during the @xmath133 periods between the pulses .",
    "all algorithms are programmed in matlab 7 on a 2,2 ghz pc with 512 mb ram .",
    "both methods are fast : the determination of whether a given signal was obtained in the presence of tnt or not , requires in both cases a calculation time less than a second , more than one order of magnitude below the necessary data acquisition time .",
    "the statistical assessment of detector performance is based on the sensitivity , specificity and ultimately on the functional relationship which exists between these two , as expressed in the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) .",
    "the true positive rate , or sensitivity , is the probability that the detector indicates the presence of a mine , when there is indeed a mine present .",
    "the false positive rate is defined as the probability that the detector indicates the presence of a mine when there was no mine present .",
    "the specificity is then defined as @xmath134false positive rate .",
    "increasing the sensitivity of the detector , lowers the specificity and vice versa .",
    "the overall performance is therefore conveniently expressed by means of a receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve , which plots the sensitivity as a function of the false positive rate . the data used to calculate the roc curves , consist of 100 data samples with tnt , and 100 data samples without tnt .",
    "because of spin - lattice relaxation , we expect the signal quality to decrease as a function of the echo number , a behavior we see reflected in the roc curves and in the line intensities of the three most visible resonances as a function of the echo number , as depicted in figure [ pict0 ] .    in figure [ pict1 ] and figure [ pict2 ] ,",
    "we have depicted roc curves for both detection methods .",
    "as is well - known , roc curves can be convexified  using mixed measurements , i.e. , measurements that are linear combinations of measurements with a threshold value that corresponds to extremal points of the experimental roc curve .",
    "this procedure results in an improved detector .",
    "nevertheless , we have depicted all roc curves calculated only for single threshold values ; the convexified roc curves can easily be visualized from the given curves .",
    "the bayes optimal detector uses the whole signal without noise reduction ( except for the hardware band - pass filter ) , whereas the demodulation detector measures the intensity of the single peak with the highest intensity , which is the same as filtering the signal with a very narrow boxcar band - pass filter . in this sense",
    "the two methods are opposites of one another .",
    "an intermediate detector can be obtained by using the three most distinct resonances in the nqr spectrum of tnt within the frequency band allowed by the band - pass filter . as can be seen from the roc curves in figure [ pict3 ] , the performance of the three peak demodulation technique ,",
    "although still lagging behind the bayes optimal detector , is better than the single peak detector .",
    "the normalized area under a roc curve can be taken as a crude measure of the overall performance of the detection scheme .",
    "the ideal case corresponds to an area of one , the completely ignorant detector scores one half .",
    "due to the high risks involved in the practice of demining , it is crucial no mine be missed , i.e. , one wants to have a sensitivity as close to 100% as possible .",
    "the bayes optimal detector allows to use any of the first 10 echo numbers to obtain a detector that is very close to ideal .",
    "in contrast , the demodulation detector only yields a close to ideal detector for the first 4 echoes .",
    "we see in figure [ pict4 ] that the overall performance of the demodulation detector decreases much more rapidly than the bayes optimal detector .",
    "as the first echo already yields a perfect detector for both methods , there seems no obvious incentive to improve the detection capabilities .",
    "however , the spin - lattice relaxation constrains the time between the spin - locked pulses to a minimum of 10 seconds .",
    "hence the necessary data acquisition time for the each single data sample , is approximately 20 acquisitions*10 seconds = 200 seconds . in actual demining applications , the necessary acquisition time will further increase as a result of rf interference , other nqr active soil constituents such as piezoelectric ceramics , and the fact that only single sided ( as opposed to the sample being _ within _ the coil , as is the case for our data )",
    ", remote acquisition is possible .",
    "however , one can substantially decrease this acquisition time by combining the information in the different echoes .",
    "it is hence of vital importance to improve the detector performance for _ all _ the echoes in the pulse sequence .",
    "the proposed detector succeeds in doing just that .",
    "we examined the applicability of a simple bayes - optimal quantum state discrimination technique to see if it is possible to improve the detection capabilities of remote tnt  detection by nqr measurements .",
    "although the experimental setup employed here is only able to give an estimate of a projection of the spin state onto the axis of symmetry of the solenoid , the method delivers a very reliable detector .",
    "a comparison was made with the popular demodulation detector .",
    "both methods are simple and fast , but our results indicate the bayes - optimal scheme offers a considerable improvement over the demodulation approach .",
    "an extension of the demodulation approach , in which the three most intense peaks are combined , offers an improvement with respect to the single frequency demodulation , but is still considerably less performant than the bayes optimal scheme . the difference in performance between the two methods becomes greater as the echo number increases .",
    "for the last few echoes , the advantage becomes less pronounced , which we attribute to the fact that the signal strength of the echo diminishes exponentially with increasing echo number , so that eventually both methods will fail to deliver for very weak echoes .",
    "handling signals with a low snr is important , as one expects a deterioration of the already low snr inherent in nqr measurements in actual field tests .",
    "the proposed detector offers two distinct and important advantages with respect to demodulation for demining applications : increase of the specificity ( without sacrificing the close to perfect sensitivity necessary for demining applications ) , and a decrease of the necessary detection time .",
    "it is possible to include data from primary detectors ( such as a metal detector or ground penetrating radar ) in the form of prior probabilities , so that the nqr detector becomes a confirmation sensor .",
    "it would be interesting to combine different pulse sequences that allow for a more complete reconstruction of the full density matrix of the spin-1 nqr system , and see whether this leads to a better detector as a result of the further decreased minimal bayes risk .",
    "varying the pulse scheme may offer other advantages too . by tailoring the pulse sequences to enact on disjoint excitations in the frequency plane ,",
    "one may , depending on the magnitude of the cross - relaxation between the modes , be able to improve the extraction of the information content by questioning different modes .",
    "if different pulse sequences are transmitted by different antennae , one can improve the fraction of nuclei participating in the nqr signal above the 43% limit for a single field orientation . as the state contains all information about the system ,",
    "a detector based on the reconstructed density operator , yields an approximation to a truly optimal detector .",
    "it remains to be seen whether an implementation of such a detector offers practical improvements for demining applications .",

    "<S> we study the statistical performance and applicability of a simple quantum state discrimination technique for the analysis of data from nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments on a tnt sample . </S>",
    "<S> the target application is remote detection of anti - personnel landmines . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , even for data that allows the determination of only one time dependent component of the nqr  subsystem , the use of the bayes optimal detector leads to greatly improved roc curves with respect to the popular demodulation technique , especially for spin echo signals with a low signal to noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the method can easily be extended to incorporate results from other sensing modalities and the incorporation of informationally complete measurements that estimate the full density matrix of the nqr subsystem . </S>"
