    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is significantly contributing to the studies of galactic structure .",
    "extensive information about the sdss can be found in azebajian et al .",
    "( 2003 , and references therein ) . here",
    "we discuss a sample of 3,127 candidate rr lyrae stars selected in @xmath11,000 deg@xmath0 of sky using color and variability information obtained from multiple sdss imaging and spectrophotometric data .",
    "details about the selection of candidate rr lyrae stars using sdss can be found in ivezi et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter i00 ) .",
    "this new sample is over 20 times larger than that analyzed by i00 , and offers significant new clues about the galactic halo structure .",
    "the estimated sample completeness is about 35% , and its efficiency ( the fraction of true rr lyrae stars ) is about 90% .",
    "additional analysis of the same sample is presented in a companion paper ( ivezi et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter i03 ) . here",
    "we attempt to answer the following questions :    * is the cutoff in the radial distribution of halo rr lyrae at @xmath150 - 60 kpc suggested by the early sdss data ( i00 ) supported by the enlarged sample discussed here ? *",
    "are there additional halo substructures comparable to those associated with the sgr dwarf tidal stream ? * is there evidence for the multiple perigalactic passages of the sgr dwarf galaxy ?",
    "the distribution of a subsample of 1,269 candidate rr lyrae stars  along the celestial equator ( @xmath2 ) in @xmath3 vs. ra diagram is shown in the top panel in figure  1 .",
    "the region studied by i00 corresponds to the range @xmath4 . as discernible from the figure , there seems to be an abrupt decrease in the number of selected candidates with @xmath5 in this region .",
    "however , the new data indicate that this is an anomaly ; outside that region candidates are found all the way to the sample faint limit at @xmath6 , including other directions on the sky not shown in the figure ( see the companion paper , i03 ) .",
    "the distribution of selected stars shown in figure  1 is very inhomogeneous .",
    "especially prominent features are the clump associated with the sgr dwarf tidal tail ( leading arm ) at ra 200 - 230 , @xmath3 19 , pal 5 globular cluster and associated tidal debris ( ra 230 , @xmath3 17.4 ) , and a clump at ra 180 , @xmath3 17",
    ". the latter is also detected by vivas et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using a complete sample of confirmed rr lyrae stars discovered by the quest survey .",
    "another prominent feature is the so - called `` southern '' clump , also associated with the sgr dwarf tidal tail ( trailing arm ) , and discovered using a - colored stars by yanny et al .",
    "we note another , previously unreported , overdensity of fainter stars ( @xmath3 19 - 20 , d 60 - 70 kpc ) in approximately the same region ( ra 30 - 60 ) . the increased number of stars around ra 320 coincides with the point where the sampled part of the celestial equator is closest to the galactic center , and is an expected consequence of the @xmath7 density distribution ( wetterer & mcgraw 1996 , and references therein ) . in summary ,",
    "although the sample is increased by a factor of 20 , the sgr dwarf tidal stream remains by far the strongest detected feature .",
    "about 1000 candidate rr lyrae stars  from the sample discussed here are found within 10@xmath8 from the sgr dwarf tidal stream plane , as defined by majewski et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter m03 ) .",
    "we use this subsample to search for evidence of multiple perigalactic passages , which should manifest themselves as multiple peaks in the number density along a line of sight that is in the orbital plane .",
    "the smoothed distribution of these stars is shown in figure  2 ( the employed coordinate system is same as in figure  11 from m03 ) .",
    "for unsmoothed data points , and histograms of the distance and radial velocity distributions see i03 .    as evident ,",
    "there are multiple peaks along each of the three lines of sight .",
    "the strongest clump is a part of the leading arm of the sgr dwarf tidal tail .",
    "the weakest features visible in this figure are still marginally statistically significant ( 2 - 3@xmath9 ) , as determined by simulations of random samples of the same size .",
    "these multiple peaks suggest that the sgr dwarf may have experienced multiple perigalactic passages , as predicted by some models ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) , but not all ( martinez - delgado et al .",
    "alternatively , comparison with an all - sky view of m giants ( m03 ) , shows by the white dots , indicates that perhaps some of the new clumps are part of the main trailing arm that extends from the sgr core through the southern galactic hemisphere , curves back towards the galactic plane and continues through the northern galactic hemisphere ( see also newberg et al .",
    "2003 ) . the clumps at ( x , y ) of ( -25,25 ) and ( -80,-40 ) are consistent with this hypothesis , but the clumps at ( -45,55 ) and ( -45,-20 ) remain unexplained . on the other hand",
    ", the structures at large radii could be fluctuations unrelated to the sgr dwarf tidal stream ( e.g. see bullock et al .",
    "for example , analogous analysis ( such as that illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ) of candidates along the celestial equator ( see fig .  1 ) reveals only slightly weaker overdensities that are more than 30@xmath8 away from the sgr dwarf tidal stream plane .",
    "a more detailed statistical analysis is required to draw definitive conclusions , and will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
