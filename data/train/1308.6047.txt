    "open clusters are formed by stars at nearly the same distance , with the nearly the same chemical , and created at essentially the same time .",
    "they are highly important in astrophysics because they serve as  laboratories \" to test theoretical models related to the effects and characteristics of the stellar composition , evolution , and environment .",
    "it is widely accepted that star clusters are formed from the fragmentation of large , dense and rotating molecular clouds , and in this process the original cloud angular momentum is partially transferred to the newly formed stars @xcite .",
    "the forming stars experience the action of several mechanisms changing their angular momentum .",
    "these mechanisms include spin - up due to contraction of the cloud , redistribution of spin momentum of the contracting cloud into orbital momentum of components by fragmentation , turbulent transport of the kinetic momentum in differently rotating clouds , and remotion of angular momentum by magnetohydrodynamical effects such as magnetic braking and driving of outflows and jets @xcite .",
    "all these mechanisms acting in certain stages , or even during the whole stellar formation process establish the angular momentum with which the star reaches the main sequence .",
    "after the star formation , closer encounters including tidal forces owing to the galactic gravitational field , encounters with field stars , and interstellar clouds crossing the way of the star cluster are expected to occur . furthermore",
    ", structural changes in the momentum of inertia due to a likely rotational decoupling between the core and the outer shells of the star , and loss of angular momentum to the stellar magnetized winds can play an important role in the evolution of the stellar angular momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these physical mechanisms contribute to the gradual loss of memory of initial stellar angular momentum , and makes the determination of the distribution of the stellar rotation a difficult task .",
    "in fact , over the last six decades , many researchers have proposed different laws controlling the rotational velocity distributions ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "usually , the frequency function for the rotational velocity , @xmath1 , is assumed to be a maxwell  boltzmann distribution law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which considers that the system has no memory of past experience ( the ergodic hypothesis ) .",
    "@xcite have modified the basic hypothesis of statistical independence between the distributions associated with the stellar angular momentum components and have proposed the nonextensivity of the stellar angular momentum ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) . in this context , the distribution function for @xmath2 is given by @xmath3^{1/(1-q ) } ,     \\label{fqobv}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is an entropic index that measures the nonextensivity of the system ( see section [ nonextform ] ) , and @xmath4 is a mass - dependent parameter associated with the characteristic width of the distribution ( see * ? ? ? * ) . at the limit @xmath5 , equation ( [ fqobv ] ) reproduces the maxwellian function proposed by @xcite .",
    "this distribution function has been tested and has been successful in describing the distribution of observed stellar rotation data @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have analyzed the relationship between the rotation and star ages in the context of the tsallis formalism , and have shown that relationship can be well reproduced using the nonextensive theory approach .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of the analysis of the relationship between the index @xmath0 and the stellar age based on a sample of 254 rotational velocity @xmath1 data for solar - type stars in open clusters . in the next section , we summarize the basic idea of nonextensive formalism .",
    "the @xmath1 data are outlined in section [ sample ] . in section [ theparameters ] ,",
    "we present the method to obtain the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 from the @xmath1 distribution , followed by the discussion of the relationship between @xmath0 and cluster ages in section [ rel_q_age ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "nonextensive formalism was proposed in @xcite and it has since been shown to be useful for studying systems out of equilibrium with long - ranged interactions , long - ranged memories , or which evolve in fractal - like space - time . in this formalism",
    "the entropy is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a positive constant , @xmath8 denotes the probability for occupation of @xmath9-th state , and @xmath10 is the total number of the configurations of the system . as @xmath11 ,",
    "the nonextensive entropy definition recovers the standard form @xmath12 where @xmath7 is the usual boltzmann constant .",
    "this means that the definition of nonextensive entropy contains boltzmann  gibbs statistics as a special case .",
    "the entropic index @xmath0 value is determined by the microscopic dynamics of the system and characterizes the degree of nonextensivity , according to the following pseudo - additivity rule for two independent systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to superextensivity and subextensivity , respectively . in the limit @xmath11",
    ", it recovers the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs entropy , which is extensive .    in nonextensive formalism",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is interpreted as a parameter of long - memory or long - range interactions between the components of the system , and larger values for @xmath0 emphasize these long - memory or long - range interactions .",
    "apart from the stellar rotation , nonextensive formalism has been successfully applied to investigate a wide variety of natural phenomena , such as self - gravitating polytropic systems @xcite , fokker ",
    "planck systems @xcite , high energy collisions @xcite , models for earthquakes @xcite , and stellar radial velocity in open clusters @xcite .",
    "the work sample consists of 254 @xmath1 data for solar - type stars from 11 galactic open clusters aged between 35.5myr and 2.6gyr .",
    "the rotational data have been selected from the survey of radial and rotational velocities performed by @xcite .",
    "the measurements were made with the coravel spectrometer @xcite , and the @xmath1 values were obtained following the calibration of @xcite , which enables measurements of @xmath1 for dwarf stars with an accuracy of about 1@xmath18 . for this study , we have selected only the stars that are considered cluster members , namely stars not flagged as `` nm '' in the notes column of table 11 of @xcite , and with a color index ranging in the interval of @xmath19 , which corresponds to the stellar masses ranging in the interval of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we have also rejected the spectroscopic binary stars because their rotational velocities can be affected by tidal effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as we are analyzing the relationship between @xmath0 and the cluster ages , using a homogeneous sample of cluster ages is fundamental in this analysis .",
    "the data from @xcite provides a uniform scale of ages for all clusters we are studying since all their cluster ages were determined with the same isochrone - based procedure .",
    "these authors have established that the accuracy of their cluster age sample is around 0.20.25 in log(age ) by considering the sources of uncertainty that potentially affect their method .",
    "one of the main factors limiting the accuracy in determining their cluster ages is that for many young clusters ( @xmath21gyr ) the ages were estimated by fitting only one cluster member star .",
    "another study relatively more rigorous in determining the ages by isochrone fitting was performed by @xcite .",
    "these authors used a homogeneous data set of more than 4000 stars with accurately determined membership , distance , metallicity , binarity , and reddening to estimate the ages of 30 open clusters between 4myr and 9.5gyr .",
    "the comparison between the ages estimated by @xcite and @xcite for 28 clusters presents a good overall agreement , with a root mean square ( rms ) of 0.33 in log(age ) . in the present study",
    ", we will use the homogeneous sample of cluster ages from @xcite .",
    "however , as the accuracy of the cluster ages may significantly influence our conclusions , we will be more careful about the possible range of individual cluster ages , and will adopt a range equal to twice the rms value from the comparison with the @xcite data , instead of the accuracy established in @xcite .    as the age of hyades is not provided by those authors , due to a limitation in their technique , we have considered the age of 787myr provided by the database for stars in open clusters webda database ( http://www.univie.ac.at/webda/ ) .",
    "the @xmath22 color indices were also taken from webda .",
    "the original survey in @xcite contains 13 open clusters ; however , two of them could not be analyzed in this work because they have few @xmath1 data in the color index range we are considering .",
    "they are ic2391 and ngc7092 with only one and two @xmath1 data , respectively . in table 1",
    "we present the main characteristics of our work sample .",
    "the number of stars in each cluster whose rotations are analyzed is given in the column ( 2 ) , the mean color index and the mean rotational velocity in @xmath18 for these stars are shown in columns ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) , respectively , and column ( 5 ) presents the logarithm of the cluster age in years .",

    "the entropic index @xmath0 measures the degree of nonextensivity of the system and emphasizes effects associated with long - memory or long - range interactions . in this context , one possible explanation for the anti - correlation between @xmath0 and cluster age would be the memory of the initial angular momentum of the stars vanishing and thus , this memory loss would be scaled by the entropic index @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that the solar - type stars retain the memory of their initial angular momentum until an age of greater than 100 myr , with this age being even higher for lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the age for extensivity , when stars have lost all memory of past angular momentum history , is around 700myr considering the best - fit curve presented in figure [ qxages ] .    in their study",

    "the unsaturated model with @xmath72 as well as skumanich law have smaller @xmath73 magnitudes , indicating that these models are better than the exponential decay in fitting the data .    according to kawaler",
    "s parameterization @xcite , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are parameters related to the dynamo theory and topology of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the @xmath74parameter ranges between 1 and 2 , for the unsaturated domain , and is 0 , for the saturated one .",
    "the saturated regime is described by a usual exponential ( @xmath76 in the nonextensive approach ) .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite suggests that the unsaturated regime is driven by a power law with exponent @xmath77 .",
    "for this regime , @xmath78 presents a lower value denoted by @xmath79 , when @xmath80 , and an upper value @xmath81 , when @xmath82 .",

    "these values for parameter @xmath75 , are approximately equal to those obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table 1 ) , if we consider the same mass range of the stars in our sample . in the context of the theory of magnetic braking ,",
    "these results support the hypothesis that solar - type stars are under the action of a braking torque provided by a radial or dipolar magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , recent numerical simulations for solar - like stellar winds from rotating stars with dipolar magnetic fields carried out by @xcite have shown that low or moderate rotation rates do not influences significantly the net torque on the star since at this rotational regime the the alfvn radius is nearly independent of the spin rate .    in order to establish the relationship between the parameter @xmath61 , derived from kawaler s parameterization , and the parameter @xmath0 from the distribution of @xmath1 , we suggest the equation @xmath89 .",
    "the variation @xmath90 is the difference between the logarithms of the cluster ages , and @xmath91 is the index @xmath0 for the cluster with age @xmath92 .",
    "this equation is a heuristic approximation based on the observation that when @xmath93 , it nearly matches the best - fit curve in figure [ qxages ] .",
    "there are at least two important consequences in admitting this relationship between @xmath61 , @xmath0 , and cluster age .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath61 will determine the slope of the curve @xmath0 versus cluster age .",
    "second , we will have a bridge between the index @xmath0 and the theory of magnetic braking of stellar rotation , since @xmath61 is related to the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that in a forthcoming paper we will present the results of applying this analysis to a large data set of rotational periods for solar mass stars in open clusters over the age range 1myr to @xmath94gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rotation periods have multiple advantages over @xmath1 as , for example , the former is free of the ambiguity inherent to the @xmath95 , and since stellar rotational periods can be measured with high precision from spot - modulation , the slower rotators are better represented in the database .",
    "we have analyzed the time relationship between the entropic index @xmath0 from the empirical distribution of rotational velocities @xmath1 for solar  type stars from 11 open clusters aged between 35.5myr and 2.6gyr . as a result , we have found that there is an anti  correlation between these @xmath0 values and the cluster age .",
    "the entropic index @xmath0 in tsallis formalism is a measure of the degree of nonextensivity of a system , with larger values for @xmath0 emphasizing the long - memory or the long - range interactions . in this work",
    "we have proposed that the loss of initial angular momentum memory for solar type stars in open clusters can be scaled by the index @xmath0 . in this context ,",
    "our results indicate that these stars lose the memory of their initial angular momentum for an age greater than about 170myr , when their rotational distribution becomes extensive .",
    "in addition , we have proposed a correlation between @xmath0 and the nonextensivity parameter @xmath61 from kawaler s parameterization , according to which @xmath61 determines the behavior of @xmath0 with cluster ages .",
    "such a relation between these two parameters can constitute a link between the parameter @xmath0 obtained from the distribution of @xmath1 and the theory of magnetic braking of stellar rotation .",

    "<S> the entropic index @xmath0 is a quantity characterizing the degree of nonextensivity , and is interpreted as a parameter of long - memory or long - range interactions between the components of the system . since its proposition in 1988 , this formalism has been applied to investigate a wide variety of natural phenomena . in stellar astrophysics , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical distribution function based on nonextensive formalism ( @xmath0distributions ) has been successfully applied to reproduce the distribution of stellar radial and rotational velocity data . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the time variation of the entropic index @xmath0 obtained from the distribution of rotation , @xmath1 , for a sample of 254 rotational data for solar - type stars from 11 open clusters aged between 35.5myr and 2.6gyr . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we have found an anti - correlation between the entropic index @xmath0 and the age of clusters , and that the distribution of rotation @xmath1 for these stars becomes extensive for an age greater than about 170myr . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the parameter @xmath0 is associated with long - memory effects , we suggest that the memory of the initial angular momentum of solar - type stars can be scaled by the entropic index @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a physical link between the parameter @xmath0 and the magnetic braking of stellar rotation . </S>"
