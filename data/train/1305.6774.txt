    "the historic discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite constitutes a breakthrough in particle physics as it implies the need of new physics beyond standard model , the detailed nature of this physics remains elusive , in particular regarding the flavour structure of the the mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation , and its characteristic scale  @xcite .",
    "early studies establishing the oscillation phenomenon have indicated a very specific pattern for the neutrino mixing angles , vastly different from the ckm mixing pattern  @xcite : while the atmospheric angle @xmath2 is close to maximal , the solar angle @xmath3 is close to 30 degrees and no evidence was then present for a nonzero @xmath1 value . although the latter may be accidental , it most likely follows a rationale .",
    "this has motivated a strong effort towards the formulation of symmetry  based approaches to address the flavour problem , in terms of an underlying flavour symmetry of leptons and/or quarks , separately or jointly .",
    "indeed , these earlier observations were successfully accounted for in terms of an underlying @xmath0 flavour symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , recent accelerator experiments minos  @xcite and t2k  @xcite as well as the measurements reported by the double chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite and reno reactor experiments  @xcite have provided robust indications that @xmath1 is nonzero , opening the door to the possibility of cp violation in neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this finding provides a challenge for many @xmath0-based schemes  @xcite , specially those leading to the so  called tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing ansatz proposed by harrison , perkins and scott  @xcite .",
    "this scheme has effective bimaximal mixing at the atmospheric scale and effective trimaximal mixing at the solar scale .",
    "here we focus on the model was proposed by babu , ma and valle  @xcite and studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "we present a simple extension of the model that introduces an extra scalar singlet flavon field @xmath4 transforming as a @xmath5 of @xmath0 to the yukawa sector of the model .",
    "we show explicitly how this breaks the remnant symmetry present in the charged lepton sector  , so as to induce a nonzero @xmath1 value , hence making the model fully realistic and opening the possibility of cp violation in neutrino oscillation .",
    "both @xmath1 and the cp violation invariant @xmath6 correlate with the new term added to the model superpotential . in particular we show how the model predicts a stringent correlation between the atmospheric and the reactor mixing parameters , substantially more restrictive than the allowed regions that emerge from recent global fits of neutrino oscillations carried out within a generic flavour - blind scheme .",
    "we show how the model correlates cp violation in neutrino oscillation with the octant of the atmospheric mixing parameter @xmath2 , and briefly comment on other possible phenomenological implications .",

    "<S> we suggest a minimal extension of the simplest @xmath0 flavour model that can induce a nonzero @xmath1 value , as required by recent neutrino oscillation data from reactors and accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted correlation between the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath2 and the magnitude of @xmath1 leads to an allowed region substantially smaller than indicated by neutrino oscillation global fits . moreover , the scheme correlates cp violation in neutrino oscillations with the octant of the atmospheric mixing parameter @xmath2 in such a way that , for example , maximal mixing necessarily violates cp . </S>",
