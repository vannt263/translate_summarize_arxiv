    "one of the most interesting and important topics in celestial mechanics as well as in dynamical astronomy is , without any doubt , the classical problem of the circular restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) .",
    "this problem describes the motion of a test particle with an infinitesimal mass under the gravitational field of two primary bodies which move in circular orbits around their common center of gravity @xcite .",
    "the applications of this problem expand in many fields of research from chaos theory and molecular physics to planetary physics , stellar systems or even to galactic dynamics .",
    "this justifies why this topic still remains active and stimulating .    over the years",
    ", several modifications of the rtbp have been proposed , especially for investigating the character of motion of massless particles in the solar system .",
    "all these modifications include additional types of forces in the total potential function of the classical rtbp in an attempt to take into consideration more dynamical parameters of the physical system and therefore make the study of the motion of the test particle more realistic .    in the classical version of the rtbp",
    "the two primary bodies are assumed to be spherically symmetric . in our solar system",
    "however , several celestial bodies , such as saturn and jupiter , have found to be sufficiently oblate @xcite .",
    "the oblateness of a celestial body should be taken into account so as the dynamical exploration of the particular planetary system to be more realistic .",
    "the influence of the oblateness coefficient has been studied in a series of papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "another interesting perturbing case is the scenario of a test particle moving in the neighborhood of a radiating primary under the combined influence of radiation and gravitational forces .",
    "this problem is known as the photogravitational rtbp .",
    "a characteristic example is the motion of a dust grain in the vicinity of a binary stellar system in which one ore even both primary bodies ( stars ) are emitting radiation thus exerting light pressure to the dust grain .",
    "the role of the radiation pressure on the motion of the test particle has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , new additional types of perturbations have been introduced to the classical rtbp . in @xcite and @xcite a three - body interaction",
    "was added to the inverse - square pairwise gravitational forces in the rtbp .",
    "the contribution of this additional force is assumed to inversely depend on the product of the distances of the test particle from the two primaries .",
    "this new model , also known as modified circular restricted three - body problem ( mcr3bp ) , is based on the assumption that in a binary star system containing a sufficient small companion the total gravitational field may not be accurately modeled by the classical pairwise gravitational interactions only .",
    "another interesting non - gravitational perturbation is the yarkovsky effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .the anisotropic emission of thermal photons , which carry momentum create a force that act on a rotating body ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the influence of the yarkovsky effect may be relatively small however , it is very important especially in celestial mechanics when calculating the proper orbits of small celestial bodies , such as asteroids .",
    "furthermore , when the regime of the rotation of an asteroid changes we have the case of the generalized yarkovsky effect , i.e. the yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack effect or the yorp effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in dynamical systems",
    "an issue of paramount importance is the determination of the basins of attraction for the equilibrium points ( which act as attractors ) using an iterative scheme . in other words",
    "the sets of initial conditions @xmath4 on the configuration plane which lead to a specific equilibrium point define the several attraction regions ( known also as basins of convergence ) .",
    "@xcite used the newton - raphson iterative method in order to investigate the basins of attraction in the hill s problem with oblateness and radiation pressure . in the same vein",

    "according to the classical circular restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) , the two primary bodies , @xmath6 and @xmath7 with masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , move on circular orbits around their common center of mass @xcite .",
    "the third body , which plays the role of a test particle , moves inside the gravitational field created by the presence of the two primaries .",
    "this test particle has significantly smaller mass than the two primaries ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and therefore we can reasonably assume that it does not perturb or influence , in any way , the keplerian motion of the primaries .    a specific system of units ( regarding length , mass and time ) was adopted so that the gravitational constant @xmath12 , the sum of the masses and the distance between the centers of the primaries to be equal to 1 . for describing the motion of the third body we choose a rotating coordinate frame of reference where its origin is at the center of mass of the two primaries .",
    "the dimensionless masses of the primaries are @xmath13 and @xmath0 , where @xmath14 is the mass ratio .",
    "both primary bodies have their centers on the @xmath15-axis and specifically at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we shall consider the general case of the photogravitational restricted three - body problem with oblateness .",
    "in particular , we assume that one of the primaries is an oblate spheroid which emits radiation .",
    "the second primary on the other hand it is assumed to be a non - radiating spherically symmetric body .",
    "this choice ( two primaries with clear and distinct physical differences ) will allow us to determine the influence of the oblateness and the radiation pressure on the newton - raphson basins of attraction .",
    "the time - independent effective potential function of the photogravitational restricted three - body problem with oblateness , according to @xcite and @xcite , is @xmath20 where @xmath3 are the coordinates of the test particle , while @xmath21 @xmath22 are the distances of the test particle from the oblate or radiating primary and spherically symmetric primary , respectively .",
    "the angular velocity is @xmath23 the oblateness coefficient is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance between the centers of the two primaries , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the equatorial and polar radius , respectively of the oblate primary .",

    "for an observer in the rotating frame of reference these formations appear to be invariant .",
    "moreover , these special five positions of the test particle for which its location appears to be stationary when viewed from the rotating frame of reference are called lagrange libration points @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the exact positions of the lagrange points are the solutions of the system @xmath45 in fig .",

    "all the initial conditions that lead to a specific equilibrium point , compose a basin of attraction or an attracting region . here",
    "we would like to clarify that the newton - raphson basins of attraction should not be mistaken with the classical basins of attraction in dissipative systems .",
    "we observe that the iterative formulae ( [ nrm ] ) include both the first and the second derivatives of the effective potential function @xmath75 and therefore we may claim that the obtained numerical results directly reflect some of the basic qualitative characteristics of the dynamical system . the major advantage of knowing the newton - raphson basins of attraction in a dynamical system is the fact that we can select the most favorable initial conditions , with respect to required computation time , when searching for an equilibrium point .    for obtaining the basins of convergence we worked as follows : first we defined a dense uniform grid of @xmath76 initial conditions regularly distributed on the configuration @xmath3 space .",
    "the iterative process was terminated when an accuracy of @xmath77 has been reached , while we classified all the @xmath3 initial conditions that lead to a particular solution ( equilibrium point ) . at the same time , for each initial point , we recorded the number @xmath78 of iterations required to obtain the aforementioned accuracy . logically , the required number of iterations for locating an equilibrium point strongly depends on the value of the predefined accuracy .",

    "<S> in this paper we use the planar circular restricted three - body problem where one of the primary bodies is an oblate spheroid or an emitter of radiation in order to determine the basins of attraction associated with the equilibrium points . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the position of the five lagrange points is monitored when the values of the mass ratio @xmath0 , the oblateness coefficient @xmath1 , and the radiation pressure factor @xmath2 vary in predefined intervals . </S>",
    "<S> the regions on the configuration @xmath3 plane occupied by the basins of attraction are revealed using the multivariate version of the newton - raphson method . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between the basins of convergence of the equilibrium points and the corresponding number of iterations needed in order to obtain the desired accuracy are also illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct a thorough and systematic numerical investigation demonstrating how the dynamical quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 influence the basins of attractions . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the mass ratio and the radiation pressure factor are the most influential parameters , while on the other hand the structure of the basins of convergence are much less affected by the oblateness coefficient .    </S>",
