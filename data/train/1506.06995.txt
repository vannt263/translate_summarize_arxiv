    "nevertheless , the important issue of the brst symmetry still lacks a simple answer , see @xcite for an overview of the on - going discussion . in the present paper",
    "we propose a manifestly brst invariant formulation of the gribov - zwanziger framework , resulting in the existence of a non - perturbative exact brst symmetry .",
    "we limit ourselves here to outline the main steps of our reasoning , postponing all details to a longer and complete work .",

    "one important property which should be underlined here is that , as observed in @xcite , the gribov region @xmath1 does not support anymore infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "if one performs an infinitesimal gauge transformation of a generic field @xmath25 belonging to @xmath1 , the resulting transformed field lies outside the region @xmath1 . from this simple argument",
    ", one easily understands that the restriction of the functional integral to the region @xmath1 might give rise to possible incompatibilities with the standard brst symmetry .",
    "the previous observation has led us to consider a non - local gauge invariant transverse field @xmath26 , @xmath27 , obtained by minimizing the auxiliary functional @xmath28 along the gauge orbit of @xmath25 , cf .",
    "@xcite and appendix [ apb ] , @xmath29 + \\frac{ig}{2}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial ^{2}},\\partial _ { \\nu } \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial ^{2}}\\right ] \\right ) + o(a^{3 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a_{\\mu } -\\frac{\\partial _ { \\mu } } { \\partial ^{2}}\\partial a+ig\\left [ a_{\\mu } , \\frac{1}{\\partial ^{2}}\\partial a\\right ] + \\frac{ig}{2}\\left [ \\frac{1}{\\partial ^{2}}\\partial a,\\partial _ { \\mu } \\frac{1}{\\partial ^{2}}\\partial a\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ig\\frac{\\partial _ { \\mu } } { \\partial ^{2}}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial _ { \\nu } } { \\partial ^{2}}\\partial a , a_{\\nu } \\right ]    + i\\frac{g}{2}\\frac{\\partial _ { \\mu } } { \\partial ^{2}}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial ^{2}},\\partial a\\right ] + o(a^{3})\\ , ,   \\label{hhh3g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 the transverse projector .",

    ", one realizes that a divergence @xmath31 is present in all higher order terms . as a consequence , we can rewrite zwanziger s horizon function @xmath7 in terms of the invariant field @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a short - hand notation , @xmath35 , @xmath36 being an infinite non - local power series of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for the gribov - zwanziger action , we may write , omitting color indices for brevity , @xmath37 where the new field @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 the use of the field @xmath38 enables us to write down an exact nilpotent non - perturbative brst transformation . rewriting the gribov - zwanziger action by using the auxiliary fields @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 it becomes clear that expression is left invariant by the nilpotent non - perturbative brst transformation @xmath42 in eqs .",

    "the operator @xmath50 is a genuine non - perturbative brst operator , as it depends explicitly on the non - perturbative gribov parameter @xmath11 .",
    "thanks to @xmath50 , we can write down non - perturbative ward identities which clarify the origin of the breaking of the standard brst operator . from the non - perturbative exact slavnov - taylor ward identities",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 has ghost number zero , it follows that the operator @xmath43 will always acquire a breaking term proportional to @xmath11 , namely @xmath53 this equation gives a clear and simple understanding of the origin of the breaking of the standard brst symmetry @xmath43 .",
    "it states that @xmath43 is always plagued by breaking terms which are proportional to the non - perturbative gribov parameter and it signals that , in presence of the gribov horizon , the brst operator @xmath43 has to be replaced by the non - perturbative one @xmath50 . it is the breaking of @xmath43 that has also been signalled recently on the lattice @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this in a more detailed forthcoming paper .",
    "moreover , we notice that @xmath54 indicating that the gribov parameter @xmath11 is _ not _ akin to a gauge parameter . as such , it will enter physical quantities . with physical quantities , we mean the colorless gauge invariant operators which are immediately seen to belong to the cohomology of the new brst operator @xmath50 .",
    "having found a non - perturbative exact nilpotent symmetry of the gribov - zwanziger action in the landau gauge , we move to the linear covariant gauges",
    ". we shall proceed by staying as close as possible to the brst construction of the gauge - fixing , i.e.  by defining it as an exact non - perturbative variation , by employing the nilpotent operator @xmath50 introduced before .",
    "moreover , this construction will be linked to the introduction of a suitable region @xmath55 in field space which shares many properties of the gribov region @xmath1 of the landau gauge .",
    "thus , according to the general brst procedure for the gauge - fixing , we write down the following @xmath50-invariant action @xmath56 with @xmath57 expression naturally generalizes the gribov - zwanziger action of the landau gauge to an arbitrary linear covariant gauge in a manifestly non - perturbative brst invariant way , namely @xmath58 the action reduces precisely to the gribov - zwanziger action in the limit @xmath59 @xmath60 while yielding the usual action of the linear covariant gauge when @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 expression is nothing but the faddeev - popov action of the linear covariant gauges @xmath63 where @xmath64 stands for the gauge parameter and @xmath65 for the lagrange multiplier .    since in expression",
    "the gauge parameter @xmath64 is coupled to a @xmath50-exact quantity , expectation values of @xmath50-invariant quantities will not depend on @xmath64 . in particular , this will be the case for the dynamical mass scale @xmath11 .",
    "as we shall see at the end of this section , the independence of @xmath11 from @xmath64 is a consequence of the fact that @xmath11 is now determined by the gauge invariant horizon condition @xmath66\\;\\mathrm{e}^{- \\left ( s_{gz}^{lcg }   - 4v\\gamma^4(n^2 - 1 ) \\right ) }   \\ ; , \\label{gaprlcg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where use has been made of the identity @xmath67\\ ;   \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta b } \\left ( { \\mathcal f(a ) }   \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left ( s_{gz}^{lcg }   - 4v\\gamma^4(n^2 - 1 ) \\right ) }   \\right ) = 0 \\;,\\ ] ] valid for an arbitrary quantity @xmath68 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , integrating out the field @xmath38 in expression , one gets the nice equation @xmath69 we point out that , recently , the linear covariant gauges have been studied in lattice numerical simulations by @xcite or with functional methods by @xcite .",
    "it is worth underlining that the tree level gluon propagator @xcite stemming from expression turns out to be in qualitative agreement with the available lattice numerical simulations @xcite , exhibiting an infrared suppression in the gluon sector .",
    "a more detailed analysis will involve taking into account additional @xmath70 condensates , following @xcite .",
    "let us provide a geometrical understanding of the action by showing that it enables one to eliminate infinitesimal gauge copies .",
    "the faddeev - popov operator for general @xmath64 reads @xmath71 infinitesimal gribov copies will appear whenever @xmath72 with @xmath73 a normalizable zero mode , in which case @xmath74 also fulfills condition if @xmath75 does .    unlike the case of the landau gauge",
    ", we notice that , when @xmath76 , the partial derivative @xmath77 and the covariant one @xmath78 do not commute . as a consequence , the faddeev - popov operator in eq .",
    "is not hermitian .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath79 plays an important role in the original gribov - zwanziger analysis .",
    "let us therefore consider @xmath80 with @xmath32 the gauge invariant field defined in eq .  . by construction , the operator @xmath81 in eq",
    "is gauge invariant order by order and hermitian , thanks to the transversality of @xmath32 .",
    "it thus makes sense to define the region @xmath82 the region @xmath55 shares the important properties of the gribov region @xmath1 of the landau gauge of being convex and bounded in all directions @xcite .",
    "those properties follow from the linearity of the operator @xmath83 in the field @xmath32 .",
    "let us recall that the landau gauge is , as far as we know , the only gauge for which it has been proven that every gauge orbit crosses at least once the gribov region @xmath1 @xcite , i.e.  a gauge field configuration located outside of the region @xmath1 is a copy of some configuration located within @xmath1 .",
    "the essential ingredient in the proof of @xcite is that the functional @xmath84 achieves its absolute minimum along the gauge orbit of @xmath85 , and this for an arbitrary starting gauge configuration @xmath85 .",
    "said otherwise , the search for the minima along the gauge orbit can be regarded as a pure mathematical problem for the functional @xmath84 , not related to the particular gauge condition obeyed by the configuration @xmath85 .",
    "actually , it turns out that the functional @xmath84 has many relative minima along the gauge orbit before attaining its absolute minimum .",
    "the set of the relative minima of @xmath84 is precisely the gribov region @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of @xcite shows thus that , given an arbitrary gauge configuration @xmath85 , it is always possible to introduce a related transverse field @xmath32 through the process of minimization of the functional @xmath84 along the gauge orbit of @xmath85 .",
    "any configuration @xmath32 can be identified with a local minimum of the functional @xmath84 , while any such minimum is left invariant by infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "our construction of a non - perturbative brst operator is possible with any @xmath32 , but for our purposes we use the unique order by order representation given in eq .  .",
    "these considerations make the region @xmath55 a suitable candidate to integrate over .",
    "let us proceed by showing that the use of the region enables us to eliminate a large class of infinitesimal gauge copies from the partition function .",
    "this proposition borrows from an earlier insight of some of us in @xcite , where only the transverse component @xmath86 , @xmath87 , was considered instead of the complete invariant gauge field @xmath32 .    following @xcite ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath73 is a zero mode of the faddeev - popov operator having a taylor expansion in @xmath64 , @xmath88 let us decompose the gauge field @xmath89 according to @xmath90 so that , in view of eq .  , we can write @xmath91 since @xmath92 has to vanish in the limit @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath94 , we can write @xmath95^{ad}f^{dbc}{\\partial}_\\mu\\left(\\tau_\\mu^b \\zeta^c\\right)\\nonumber\\\\&=&- g\\alpha\\left[\\mathcal{m}(a^h)^{-1}\\right]^{ad}f^{dbc}{\\partial}_\\mu\\left({\\hat \\tau}_\\mu^b\\zeta^c\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , expanding in powers of @xmath64 , @xmath96^{ad}f^{dbc}{\\partial}_\\mu\\left(\\zeta_n ^c{\\hat \\tau}_\\mu^{b}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] matching orders of @xmath64 shows that the @xmath97 order coefficient @xmath98 is proportional to the @xmath99 . since for the first coefficient we find @xmath100 , we immediately find @xmath101 , and thus @xmath102 .",
    "said otherwise , all zero modes that possess a taylor expansion around @xmath103 , are automatically vanishing .",
    "as such , the restriction to @xmath55 excludes at least the set of infinitesimally connected gauge copies related to the aforementioned zero modes .",
    "we proceed by implementing @xmath104 into the path integral .",
    "we rely on the so - called gribov no - pole condition @xcite , whose all order implementation can be found in @xcite . for any external field @xmath32 , we can use wick s theorem to invert the operator @xmath105 in any dimension @xmath106 . denoting by @xmath107 the fourier - transform of the inverse of @xmath105 ,",
    "one introduces the so - called gribov form factor @xcite @xmath108 through @xmath109 repeating the procedure outlined in @xcite , it follows that at zero momentum @xmath110^{bc}_{k - q}a_\\mu^{h , ca}(q).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparison of eqns .   and learns that @xmath111 .",
    "we will concentrate on the zero momentum limit , since it is expected on general grounds as a perturbed system around @xmath112 , which reaches its lowest eigenvalue at zero momentum .",
    "a few comments regarding this were made in @xcite .",
    "one can also check , a posteriori but explicitly , that the expectation value @xmath113 is maximal . ]",
    "that the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath105 will carry no momentum , so it would be sufficient to avoid this eigenvalue becoming negative . at the level of expectation values , we can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath114 so that we must impose at the level of the path integral @xmath115 , or @xmath116 we can add this constraint to the path integral measure with a step function . via a saddle point evaluation in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ,",
    "one then finds @xmath117 \\theta[vd(n^2 - 1)-h(a^h)]\\mathrm{e}^{-s_{fp}^{h } }   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & [ \\euscript{d}{{\\phi}}]\\int\\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi i\\eta } \\mathrm{e}^{-s_{fp}^{h}+\\eta[vd(n^2 - 1)-h(a^h)]}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\to&[\\euscript{d}{{\\phi}}]\\mathrm{e}^{-s_{fp}^{h}+\\eta^\\ast[vd(n^2 - 1)-h(a^h ) ] } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 stands for the expression given in eq .  .",
    "the saddle point equation precisely amounts to eq .  ,",
    "i.e.  the horizon condition with identification @xmath119 . as",
    "the horizon condition is writable in terms of the vacuum energy and since the only contributing diagrams to the latter are @xmath120 ( see also @xcite ) , it indeed follows that condition is met . as such , we do have excluded a large set of zero modes by effectively having imposed that @xmath121 via the action . upon introduction of the auxiliary fields @xmath40 ,",
    "the latter is equivalent to the action appearing in eq .",
    ", given that eq",
    ".   holds .",
    "for the first time , we have identified a non - perturbative nilpotent brst symmetry for gauge theories quantized  la gribov - zwanziger , that is by further restricting the domain of integration in the path integral .",
    "this eliminates a large set of gauge copies and deeply affects the infrared low - momentum regime of the gauge theory . the new brst operator @xmath50 depends explicitly on the gauge invariant mass parameter @xmath11 that is linked to the aforementioned restriction .",
    "as such , the operator @xmath50 itself is intertwined with this geometric restriction .",
    "the introduction of @xmath50 opens up whole new strata of applications .",
    "we have already discussed a first one in this paper , namely a non - perturbative extension of the usual linear covariant gauge to a setting where the gribov gauge fixing ambiguity is also faced in this gauge .",
    "our setup generalizes to the refined gribov - zwanziger approach @xcite , in which case we can make contact with the gauge invariant @xmath70 condensate @xmath122 , of important phenomenological interest @xcite .",
    "a renormalization analysis of the proposed framework is already in preparation , of relevance to explicit studies of propagators , spectrum and thermodynamics .",
    "generalizations , compatible with the new non - perturbative brst , to the matter sector are also possible .",
    "moreover , it would also be interesting to make contact with lattice studies of the linear covariant gauge , e.g.  to find out if a practical numerical implementation of our proposal exists .",
    "we are already studying a functional depending on the original gauge field @xmath25 and an auxiliary field @xmath123 , with the property that the minimum occurs for @xmath124 ( thus effectively implementing the linear covariant gauge ) and for @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "this could circumvent potential issues with the convergence of the series expression used in eq .   to define @xmath32 in case of `` large '' gauge fields , while it would also open the road to simulation of our proposed non - perturbative linear covariant gauge .",
    "we will report on this in future work .    as a final but most crucial remark",
    ", we stress that no sacrifices have to be made w.r.t .",
    "gauge invariance , even when the gribov problem is taken into account .",
