    "protein ubiquitin ( ub ) continues to attract the attention of researchers because there exist many processes in living systems where it plays the vital role .",
    "usually , ub presents in the form of a polyubiquitin chain that is conjugated to other proteins .",
    "different ub linkages lead to different biological functions . in case of lys48-c and n - c linkages polyubiquitin chain serves as a signal for degradation proteins @xcite , whereas in the lys63-c case it plays completely different functions , including dna repair , polysome stability and endocytosis @xcite .",
    "the folding properties of ub have been studied in detail by experiments @xcite as well as by simulations @xcite .",
    "the unfolding of ub under thermal fluctuations was investigated experimentally by cordier and grzesiek @xcite and by chung _",
    "@xcite , and studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that thermal unfolding pathways are reverse of the folding ones .",
    "the mechanical unfolding of ub has been studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "it was found that the unfolding may proceed through rare intermediates , but the overall behavior remains two - state , although a three - state scenario was also reported @xcite .",
    "the mechanical unfolding pathways are very different from the thermal pathways , and depend on what terminal is kept fixed @xcite .    recently fernandez and coworkers @xcite have applied the force - clamp technique to probe refolding of ub under quench force , @xmath1 , which is smaller than the equilibrium critical force separating the folded and unfolded states .",
    "this kind of experiment has a number of advantages over the standard ones . in the force - clamp technique",
    ", one can control starting conformations which are well prepared by applying the large initial force of several hundreds of pn .",
    "moreover , since the quench force slows down the folding process , it is easier to monitor refolding pathways .",
    "however , this begs the important question as to whether the experiments with one end of the protein anchored probes the same folding pathways as a free - end protein .",
    "recently , using a simple go - like model , it has been shown that fixing the n - terminal of ub changes its folding pathways @xcite .",
    "if it is so , the force - clamp technique in which the n - terminal is anchored is not useful for prediction of folding pathways of the free - end ub .",
    "when one studies thermodynamics of a large system like multi - domain ubiquitin the problem of slow dynamics occurs , due to the rough free energy landscape .",
    "this problem might be remedied using the standard replica exchange method in the temperature space in the absence of external force @xcite as well as in the presence of it @xcite . however ,",
    "if one wants to construct the force - temperature phase diagram , then this approach becomes inconvenient because one has to collect data at different values of forces .",
    "moreover , the external force increases unfolding barriers and a system may get trapped in some local minima . in order to have better sampling for a system subject to external force we propose a new replica exchange method in which the exchange is carried not in the temperature space but in the force space , i.e. the exchange between different force values .",
    "this procedure would help the system to escape from local minima efficiently .    in this paper",
    "we address three topics .",
    "first , we develop a new version of the replica exchange method to study thermodynamics of a large system under the force .",
    "the basic idea is that for a given temperature we perform simulation at different values of force and the exchange between them is carried out according to the metropolis rule .",
    "this new approach has been employed to obtain the force - temperature phase diagram of the three - domain ubiquitin . within our choice of force replicas it speeds up",
    "computation about four times compared to the conventional simulation .",
    "second , question we ask is under what conditions the force - clamp technique still gives the same folding pathways as for the free - end ub .",
    "third , we determine the temperature dependence of the unfolding force , the unfolding barriers and the location of the transition state of the single ub and of the three - domain ub ( the three - domain ub will be also referred to as trimer ) .",
    "because the study of refolding of 76-residue ub by all - atom simulations is beyond present computational facilities , the go modeling is an appropriate choice .",
    "the go - like model @xcite was proved @xcite to give not only qualitative but also quasi - quantitative agreement with existing refolding and unfolding experiments .",
    "therefore we will use it to study the folding and unfolding of a single and multi - domain ub . in agreement with an earlier study @xcite",
    ", we show that fixing n - terminal of the single ub changes its folding pathways .",
    "our new finding is that anchoring c - terminal leaves them unchanged .",
    "more importantly , we have found that for the three - domain ub with either end fixed , each domain follows the same folding pathways as for the free - end single domain .",
    "therefore , to probe the folding pathways of ub by the force - clamp technique one can either use the single domain with c - terminal fixed , or several domains with either end fixed . in order to check",
    "if the effect of fixing one terminus is valid for other proteins , we have studied the titin domain i27 .",
    "it turns out that the fixation of one end of a polypeptide chain does not change the refolding pathways of i27 .",
    "therefore the force - clamp can always predict the refolding pathways of the single as well as multi - domain i27 .",
    "our study suggests that the effect of the end fixation is not universal for all proteins , and the force - clamp spectroscopy should be applied with caution .",
    "the third part of this paper was inspired by the recent pulling experiments of yang _",
    "_ @xcite . performing the experiments in the temperature interval between 278 and 318 k",
    ", they found that the unfolding force ( maximum force in the force - extension profile ) , @xmath2 , of ub depends on temperature linearly .",
    "in addition , the corresponding slopes of the linear behavior have been found to be independent of pulling velocities .",
    "an interesting question that arises is if the linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 is valid for this particular region , or it holds for the whole temperature interval . using the same go model @xcite , we can reproduce the experimental results of yang _",
    "@xcite on the quasi - quantitative level .",
    "more importantly , we have shown that for the entire temperature interval the dependence is not linear , because a protein is not an entropic spring in the temperature regime studied .    as a part of the third topic",
    ", we have studied the effect of multi - domain construction and linkage on the location of the transition state along the end - to - end distance reaction coordinate , @xmath4 .",
    "it is found that the multi - domain construction has a minor effect on @xmath4 but , in agreement with the experiments @xcite , the lys48-c linkage has the strong effect on it . using the microscopic theory for unfolding dynamics @xcite , we have determined the unfolding barrier for ub .    to summarize , in this article we have obtained the following novel results .",
    "we have proposed a new replica exchange method , in which the exchange is carried out between different external forces at a given temperature .",
    "it is shown that the force - clamp technique probes the same folding pathways as the free - end ub , if one keeps the c - terminal fixed or uses the multi - domain ub with what ever terminal anchored .",
    "contrary to the @xmath5-protein ubiquitin , anchoring one end has a minor effect on refolding pathways of the titin domain i27 .",
    "we attribute this to its @xmath6-sandwich structure , which is mechanically more stable .",
    "if ub is pulled at lys48 and c then , in the bell approximation , we obtained the parameter @xmath7 0.61 nm .",
    "this estimate agrees well with the experimental result of fernandez group @xcite .",
    "we propose to fit simulation data with different theoretical schemes to determine the distance between the transition state and the native state , @xmath4 , for biomolecules .",
    "our estimate for unfolding barrier of ub is in reasonable agreement with the experiments .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the unfolding force is linear for some narrow interval , but that this dependence should be nonlinear in general .",

    "_ since the native conformation of poly - ubiquitin is not available yet , we have to construct it for go modeling .",

    "the probability of observing this main pathways varies between 70 and 78% ( fig .",

    "other minor routes to the folded state are also possible .",
    "because the multi - domain construction weakens this effect , we expect that the force - clamp spectroscopy can probe refolding pathways for a single and poly - i27 .",

    "one important consequence , following from eq .",
    "[ dudko_eq ] , is that one can apply this technique to estimate not only @xmath4 but also @xmath135 for @xmath133 and 2/3 .",
    "this will be done in this section for the single ub and the trimer .",

    "@xcite have shown that @xmath4 does depend on @xmath48 . at low forces , where the bell approximation is valid @xcite , they obtained @xmath138  , which is noticeably higher than our and the experimental value .",
    "presumably , this is due to the fact that these authors computed @xmath4 from equilibrium data , but their sampling was not good enough for such a long protein as ub .",
    "we now use eq .",

    "the values of @xmath140 and @xmath130 obtained from the fitting procedure are listed in table 1 . in accord with ref .",
    "all of these quantities increase with decreasing @xmath141 . in our opinion ,",
    "the microscopic theory ( @xmath139 and @xmath133 ) gives too high a value for @xmath4 compared to its typical experimental value @xcite .",
    "however , the latter was calculated from fitting experimental data to the bell formula , and it is not clear how much the microscopic theory would change the result .    in order",
    "to estimate the unfolding barrier of ub from the available experimental data and compare it with our theoretical estimate , we use the following formula @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the unfolding time in the absence of force and @xmath144 is a typical unfolding prefactor .",

    "the fact that @xmath4 for the linkage lys48-c is larger than that of the n - c ub may be understood using our recent observation @xcite that it anti - correlates with the contact order ( co ) @xcite . defining contact formation between any two amino acids ( @xmath153 ) as occuring when the distance between the centers of mass of side chains @xmath154 (see also @xmath155_@xmath156 )",
