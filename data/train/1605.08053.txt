    "noisy cluster state preparation , storage , and measurement will translate into an effective noise channel per gate as the measurement - based computation proceeds .",

    "the noise assumptions also require that @xmath107 be independent of time and the gate being implemented .",
    "the validity of these assumptions will depend on the relevant noise sources for cluster state preparation and measurement .      as mentioned above , errors that occur in the preparation of the cluster state can lead to logical errors in the mbqc logic gates .",

    "the basic building block of our scheme is the three node cluster wire shown in .",
    "using the clifford group simplifies the experimental setup as all measurement devices need only to be programmed to measure in either the pauli @xmath12 or @xmath13 basis since the measurement angles are all integer multiples of @xmath114 ( see appendix  [ appb ] for a gate - to - measurement conversion table ) . furthermore",

    "so long as the angles are chosen uniformly at random from the clifford table in appendix  [ appb ] , the gate implemented will also be uniformly random , irrespective of the measurement outcomes .",
    "thus , the indeterminism of the logic gates does not interfere with this measurement - based rb protocol .",

    "however , as a result of the indeterminacy of the measurement outcomes , each chosen sequence can result in one of @xmath125 possible sequences occurring .",
    "thus , much of the randomness required by the above protocol is redundant .",
    "when each cluster state measurement yields outcome 0 or 1 with equal probability , the scheme can be simplified .",

    "the full clifford rb protocol ( selecting from @xmath119 rather than @xmath133 at random ) can be used .",
    "alternatively , we can restore uniformity into the measurement outcome distributions to deal with problematic noise channels .",

    "we also note that this trick will modify the effective noise channel .",
    "basing this scheme on the clifford group should allow for generalization to the multi - qubit setting while preserving the advantages discussed above .",
    "for instance , with a universal cluster state [ say , on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice ] , clifford circuits can still be implemented in a single time step as there is no need for active feedforward .",
