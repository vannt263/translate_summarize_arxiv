    "felobal ( iron lobal ) quasars are a rare subclass of broad absorption - line quasars ( bal quasars ) recently emerging thanks to the large sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "bal quasars show broad ( 2,000  20,000 km s@xmath7 ) blueshifted ( 2,000  60,000 km s@xmath7 ) absorption lines in the uv wavelength region .",
    "bal quasars showing high - ionization absorption lines such as c iv , n v , si iv , and ly@xmath1 are called hibal quasars , and some bal quasars also show low - ionization absorption lines of mg ii , al ii , and al iii in addition to the high - ionization absorption lines , which are called lobal quasars .",
    "about 10  20 % of optically selected quasars are bal ( hibal ) quasars and @xmath15% of them are lobal quasars ( weymann et al . 1991",
    "; hewett & foltz 2003 ; reichard et al . 2003 ; trump et al .",
    "there is a subclass of lobal quasars which show numbers of absorption lines originated in fe ii and fe iii ( hazard et al .",
    "1987 ; cowie et al .",
    "1994 ; becker et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; reichard et al . 2003 ; hall et al .",
    "they are called iron lobal ( felobal ) quasars and occupy about 15 % of lobal quasars ( hall et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "nature of bal quasars is still not well understood .",
    "there are two major views for bal quasars : bal quasars are non - bal quasars seen with a different viewing angle ( e.g. , weymann et al . 1991 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ) , and bal quasars are young or recently refueled quasars ( e.g. , boroson & meyers 1992 ; becker et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the latter view",
    ", the broad absorption lines appear when a nucleus is blowing gas and dust out during a dust - enshroud quasar phase which leads the bal quasars to non - bal quasars .",
    "if this view is correct , bal quasars ( especially lobal quasars ) are expected to also be ultra - luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "in fact , all four lobal and felobal quasars known to date at @xmath16 have the infrared luminosities larger than @xmath17 ( canalizo & stockton 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , reichard et al . ( 2003 ) show that average uv spectrum is getting flatter in the order of non - bal , hibal , lobal , and felobal quasars and the color excesses amount @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag for hibal and lobal quasars , respectively with small magellanic cloud ( smc)-like reddening law .",
    "the average uv spectrum of felobal quasars is much flatter than those ( reichard et al .",
    "2003 ) and hence felobal quasars may be the most obscured ones among bal quasars .",
    "thus a large amount of gas and dust may exist in lobal quasars , especially in felobal quasars .",
    "we found a felobal quasar at @xmath20 with an h@xmath1 absorption line in the broad h@xmath1 emission line . the object , sdss j083942.11 + 380526.3 ( hereafter sdss j0839 + 3805 ) , was originally found during our search for felobal quasars at @xmath21 by visual inspection of @xmath22 spectra in the sdss data release 3 ( dr3 ; abazajian et al .",
    "the color excess of sdss j0839 + 3805 is @xmath23 mag with the smc - like reddening law if the intrinsic spectrum is the same as a composite spectrum of non - bal quasars , suggesting the presence of larger obscuration than typical lobal quasars .",
    "subsequent near - infrared spectroscopy with the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for oh suppressor attached to the subaru telescope revealed the presence of h@xmath1 absorption line in the broad h@xmath1 emission line ( aoki et al .",
    "the absorption line is not originated in stellar continuum .",
    "the absolute magnitude in the @xmath24-band is @xmath25 mag ( ab ) , and this was the first discovery of such system in quasars ; only known such system was seyfert 1 ngc 4151 at that time .",
    "very recently , two more felobals have been found to show balmer absorption lines ( hall 2007 ; aoki et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the width of the absorption line in sdss j0839 + 3805 is @xmath26 km s@xmath7 with a blue shift of @xmath27 520 km s@xmath7 relative to the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption line is estimated to be @xmath28  depending on the employed intrinsic line profile of the h@xmath1 broad emission line .",
    "the equivalent width corresponds to a column density of neutral hydrogen of @xmath29 @xmath30 if we assume a gas temperature of @xmath31 k from the curve of growth ( see aoki et al .",
    "2006 for details ) .",
    "it suggests that sdss j0839 + 3805 may be a large gas reservoir in the very young phase from a ultra - luminous infrared galaxy to a quasar .",
    "motivated by these , we made co observations of sdss j0839 + 3805 aimed at detecting the molecular gases . in this paper , we adopt the flat cosmology of @xmath32 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "co ( @xmath2 ) observations were made with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) at the nobeyama radio observatory from 2005 november 27 to december 1 with c - configuration and from 2006 march 15 to march 18 and from 2006 april 3 to april 5 with d - configuration ( more compact than c - configuration ) .",
    "the expected observed frequency for the redshifted co ( @xmath2 ) line is 104.221 ghz based on the redshift determined with h@xmath1 emission ( @xmath35 ) , which would give the most reliable systemic redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the accuracy we achieved corresponds to a velocity uncertainty of only about 180 km s@xmath7 , which is negligibly small for the ultra wide band correlator ( uwbc , okumura et al .",
    "2000 ) used covering 1024 mhz ( @xmath36 km s@xmath7 ) . in actual observations , however , we adopted the central frequency of 104.477 ghz to avoid the exact center of the spectrograph .",
    "this displacement also does not cause a serious frequency coverage problem .",
    "a field of view was @xmath37 , and angular resolutions were 2@xmath383@xmath38 and 4@xmath386@xmath38 for c- and d - configuration , respectively .",
    "a total integration time was 25 and 17 hours for the c- and the d - configuration , respectively .",
    "the reference calibration was made with radio source of b0821 + 394 for each observation .",
    "the flux calibration and band - pass calibration were made with 3c273 ( @xmath39 jy at 105.7 ghz ) for c - configuration in november 2005 and d - configuration in march 2006 , and 3c84 ( @xmath40 jy at 110.2 ghz ) for d - configuration in april 2006 .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux scale calibrations was estimated to be @xmath41% for each observation .",
    "the weather conditions were fine during the observing runs with the c - configuration and the second run of the d - configuration .",
    "the uv - data reduction was carried out by uvproc - ii package developed at the nobeyama radio observatory ( tsutsumi et al .",
    "1997 ) . after discarding bad visibilities and calibrating visibilities , we produced channel maps and an integrated intensity map using nrao aips package for each configuration .",
    "the rms noises in the maps were 3.6 mjy beam@xmath7 and 5.0 mjy beam@xmath7 for c- and d - configuration , respectively with a velocity bin of 184 km s@xmath7 .",
    "finally , we made the integrated intensity map using the combined data taken with c- and d - configurations .",
    "the synthesis beam size was @xmath42 and the rms noise was 2.9 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "a contour map centered at 104.22 ghz integrated in the 184 km s@xmath7 velocity bin obtained with the c - configuration is shown in left panel of figure 1 .",
    "a signal - like feature is seen at @xmath43 southeast of the quasar position ; the peak value in the map is 9 mjy beam@xmath7 with a significance of @xmath44 .",
    "the width of the feature is about 300 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the feature was seen in each observing date with a worse significance level .",
    "it should be noted that the position of the quasar is taken from sdss catalog and its accuracy is less than 0.@xmath381 ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the accuracy of the astrometry in the nma observations is expected to be fairly less than @xmath45 .",
    "however , in a contour map obtained with the d - configuration ( the middle panel of figure 1 ) , the feature did not appear ; if the feature is real it corresponds to be 1.8@xmath5 in the data obtained with d - configuration .",
    "we made the map for each of the two observing runs with d - configuration , but we could not see the emission - like feature . although we examined the data taken with the c - configuration and d - configuration carefully to see whether some spurious data exist or not , we could not find such spurious data . in the combined data ( c- and d - configurations ) , the map integrated with the velocity bin of 184 km s@xmath7 centered at the 104.22 ghz is shown in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "no emission feature with a significance larger than 3@xmath5 is present .",
    "the 2.5@xmath5 feature is seen at about 2@xmath38 northeast of the quasar position , but this position does not coincide with the peak of the feature seen in the c - configuration . if the feature is real and we see the molecular gas in the quasar , the displacement of @xmath46 of the feature might be due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the emission . alternatively , the displacement ( a projected distance of 16 kpc at the redshift ) might be real .",
    "a double peaked distribution of molecular gas was not unusual in high redshift quasars ( klamer et al . 2004 ) ; for instance in the quasar br 1202 - 0725 at @xmath47 , no host galaxy has been found for a molecular gas component separated by 4@xmath38 ( projected distance of 26 kpc at the redshift ) from the quasar position ( carilli et al .",
    "thus there might be a case that the molecular gas in the quasar itself is not rich , while it is gas rich in a putative close companion . in any cases",
    ", however , the feature only shows the @xmath48 significance at most .",
    "the feature is not seen in the d - configuration data and the location seen in the combined data is different from that seen in the c - configuration data .",
    "therefore we regard that this feature is not real and derive the upper limit on the molecular gas mass below .    from the rms noise , we set the upper limit on the co luminosity as well as the molecular gas mass as follows , @xmath49 where , @xmath50 is the light speed , @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath52 is the luminosity distance , @xmath5 is the rms noise ( 2.9 mjy beam@xmath7 ) of the combined data at the velocity width of @xmath53 ( 184 km s@xmath7 ) , @xmath54 is the rest frequency of the target line . in order to estimate the molecular gas mass , the conversion factor from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , @xmath1 , is necessary .",
    "although the value of @xmath1 in this system is unknown , we adopt @xmath57 ( k km s@xmath7 pc@xmath8)@xmath7 to compare recent results of the co observations of high redshift quasars ( solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) . here",
    "we also assume that @xmath13 is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting upper limit on the molecular gas mass is @xmath59 .",
    "the upper limit on the molecular gas mass of @xmath59 ( or @xmath13 of @xmath60 k km s@xmath7",
    "pc@xmath61 ) should be confronted with the molecular gas masses detected in quasars at @xmath14 ; they are mostly derived from @xmath62 and range from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( solomon and vanden bout 2005 , with the same cosmology and the conversion factor ) , where @xmath65 refers to the magnification factor of the gravitational lens .",
    "the largest value comes from a very red quasar presumably obscured by dust ( mg0414 + 0534 ) . among them , cloverleaf ( h1413 + 117 ) and vcv j1409 + 5628",
    "are bal quasars , and their molecular gas masses are @xmath66 ( delensed with @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "therefore the felobal of sdss j0839 + 3805 is not very molecular gas rich as compared with quasars and bal quasars at the similar redshifts .",
    "this is true even if the emission - like feature mentioned above is real .    in conclusion ,",
    "our target of felobal sdss j0839 + 3805 with the balmer absorption line is turned out not to be very molecular gas rich among quasars at the similar redshift , and it is the case even if the emission - like feature is real .",
    "however this is the first trial observation of a felobal quasar in our knowledge , further observations in submillimeter ( lewis et al .",
    "2003 ; willott et al . 2003 ; priddey et al .",
    "2006 ) and co line are necessary to examine the amount of molecular gases and its relation to the line - of - sight absorption in felobal quasars as well as bal quasars .",
    "we thank the staff members of the nobeyama radio observatory for the help of the observations .",
