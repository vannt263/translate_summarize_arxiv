    "a superconductor in contact with a normal metal induces cooper correlations between electrons in the normal region , the phenomenon known as the proximity effect . its microscopic origin lies in andreev reflection  @xcite of an electron into a hole at the normal - metal  superconducting ( n - s ) interface .",
    "the probability of andreev reflection and thus the strength of the proximity effect is determined by the transparency of the n - s interface and the nature of electron propagation in the n part of the structure .",
    "disorder in the normal conductor near the n - s contact was shown theoretically  @xcite to increase considerably the effective probability of andreev reflection ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review from the experimental viewpoint ) .    the standard semiclassical theory of n - s conductivity  @xcite , based either on the traditional nonequilibrium superconductivity approach  @xcite or on the scattering formalism  @xcite , usually neglects interaction effects in the n part of the structure",
    ". however , in low - dimensional structures , coulomb interaction in the normal diffusive region gets enhanced  @xcite , which may affect strongly the andreev conductance and noise .    in this paper",
    "we address the effect of interaction between electrons in the normal part of an n - s structure on the charge transport through the system . to study a system with interaction a novel theoretical method",
    "should be developed since neither of the above - mentioned approaches can handle interaction corrections . indeed ,",
    "the scattering matrix formalism relying on the linear relation between the outgoing and incoming states is _ a priori _ a one - particle description . on the other hand ,",
    "larkin - ovchinnikov kinetic equation  @xcite can be generalized to allow for ( at least some part of ) interaction corrections , but its practical solution seems hardly possible beyond the first order of perturbation theory in interaction strength  @xcite .    an appropriate formalism had been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the keldysh action for disordered superonductors  @xcite .",
    "we start from the fully microscopic lagrangian describing interacting electrons in the diffusive conductor . then , successively integrating over electronic degrees of freedom in the normal conductor we end up with the _ proximity action _ , @xmath0 $ ] , which is a functional of two matrices , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , describing the states of the superconductive and external normal terminals of the n - s structure ( cf .  fig .

    "once the form of the proximity action is known , one can easily calculate the conductivity of the system , current noise , and , in principle , higher correlators of current and even the full statistics of transmitted charge  @xcite .",
    "the proximity action approach bears an obvious analogy with the scattering matrix approach  @xcite as both describe transport properties in terms of the characteristics of the terminals ( stationary - state green functions of the terminals @xmath3 in the former versus asymptotic scattering states in the latter approach ) . in this respect",
    ", the proximity action method also shares the logic of nazarov s circuit theory of andreev conductance  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
