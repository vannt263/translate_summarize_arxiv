    "suspended nanotubes form a interesting and promising system for various nanoelectromechanical device setups and has been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite . because of their large aspect ratio , nanotubes can be modeled as simple one - dimensional strings using classical elasticity theory@xcite . here",
    "we study the electromechanical coupling when suspended nanotubes are put in a single - electron - transistor ( set ) setup .    when nanotubes are contacted by electrodes they form in most cases contacts with a large resistance , which results in coulomb blockade behavior .",
    "this type of single - electron - tunnelling devices have also been fabricated with the nanotubes suspended between the two electrodes@xcite .",
    "for these devices the interesting possibility occurs that a coupling between the electronic degree of freedom and the vibration might show up in the current .",
    "such a coupling has indeed been observed in several experiments .",
    "the first example leroy et al.@xcite observed phonon sidebands with both absorbtion and emission peaks , which were taken as evidence for the radial breathing mode being strongly excited and thus behaving essentially as a classical external time - dependent potential .    in the quantum regime",
    "the electron - vibron coupling leads to steps in the iv characteristic , similar to the well - known franck - condon principle .",
    "this has been seen in a number of single - molecule devices@xcite and is well understood in terms of rate equations@xcite . recently",
    ", similar physics was observed in suspended nanotubes@xcite where the vibrational energy suggested that the sidebands were due to coupling to a longitudinal stretching mode .",
    "however , the coupling mechanism was unclear . it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the electric field parallel to the tube coupled to the nuclear motion . here",
    "we will argue that due to screening in the tube the longitudinal electric field is too weak to excite the longitudinal mode , and instead point to the non - linear coupling between the traverse and longitudinal mode as the possible coupling mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss in section  [ sec : electrostat ] the electrostatics of the charged suspended nanotube , followed by an account in section  [ sec : elastic ] of the elastic properties of the hanging tube . in section  [ sec : fc ] , the modes of the tube are quantized and the franck - condon overlap factors are calculated .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we now discuss the electrostatics of the charge suspended nanotube .",
    "first we consider the longitudinal electric field , and then the radial field .      for a metallic tube there would , of course , be no electric field in the longitudinal direction .",
    "however , the tube has a finite screening length due to the kinetic energy .",
    "we have analyzed this situation using the following density functional for the total energy of a nanotube with linear dispersion @xmath0=      \\frac{\\hbar}{2}{\\int_0^l}dx\\,{v_\\mathrm{f}^{{}}}(x)[\\rho(x)]^2+\\frac12{\\int_0^l}dx{\\int_0^l}dx'\\,\\rho(x)v(x , x')\\rho(x'),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the fermi velocity and @xmath2 is the effective 1d potential for a cylindric conductor .",
    "details about the interaction and the solution are given in appendix a. one should include screening due to both gate and source - drain electrodes . the gate can be included as a metallic plane at some distance @xmath3 , and the source - drain electrodes as a section of the wire with @xmath4 .",
    "see figure  2 for an illustration of this .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to minimize the energy functional in equation  ( [ frho ] ) under the constraint that a charge of one electron is added to the tube , we add a lagrange multiplier @xmath5=e[\\rho]+\\lambda\\left({\\int_0^l}dx\\rho(x)-e\\right).\\ ] ] first , we minimize with respect to @xmath6 and find @xmath7}=      \\hbar{v_\\mathrm{f}^{{}}}\\rho(x)+{\\int_0^l}dx'\\,v(x , x')\\rho(x')+\\lambda=0,\\ ] ] and then with respect to @xmath8 : @xmath9 these two linear equations are readily solved numerically .",
    "once the solution is found , the electric field is given by @xmath10 the important parameters in this solution are the aspect ratio of the tube , i.e. , @xmath11 , and the strength of the interaction @xmath12 for typical parameters , one has @xmath13 , while the aspect ratio is @xmath14 .",
    "the distance to the gate is not important , as long as it longer than the length over which the electric decays , which is typically the case .",
    "our numerical solution gives an electric field comparable to the results of guinea@xcite ( see also reference  @xcite ) , which results in an electric force of order @xmath15 n , for typical nanotube devices .",
    "however , this field is limited to a small region near the contacts , and therefore the total effect of it is small .    for @xmath16",
    ", we can in fact make a simple approximation which quit accurately describes the full numerical solution .",
    "the electric field can related to the charge density by differentiating the condition ( [ erhomin ] ) with respect to @xmath17 : @xmath18.\\ ] ] because @xmath19 changes little along the wire , we may set @xmath20 and we thus obtain @xmath21.\\ ] ] the width of the delta function will be given by microscopic details of the interface between the tube and the contact , i.e. a length scale of the order of the radius of the tube itself .",
    "this length scale we denote by @xmath22 .      the term in the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the electron charge density and the nuclear system is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density of the positive ions in the tube .",
    "the force per length acting on the mechanical degrees of freedom is therefore given by @xmath25 . in terms of the displacement field defined below in equation  ( [ udef ] ) , @xmath26 becomes @xmath27=      -e\\rho_0 \\int dx\\,e_x(x)\\ , u(x).\\ ] ]      to find the electric field in the radial direction we model the nanotube as a distributed capacitor similarly to sapmaz et al.@xcite .",
    "we include capacitances to the electrodes @xmath28 and to the gate @xmath29 where the capacitance to the gate is @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the distributed capacitance of a tube over a plane .    to find the total charge on the tube , we write the total electrostatic energy as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is total capacitance with charge @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the difference between the nanotube and the electrode work functions .",
    "( here we neglect the effect of the source , drain and gate voltages , because they are considerably smaller than @xmath36 . )",
    "the optimum charge is thus @xmath37 for single - walled carbon nanotubes the workfunction is about 4.7 ev@xcite , while for gold it is 5.1 ev . for typical devices",
    "@xmath38 f and hence @xmath39 . the electrostatic energy is used in the following section to calculate force acting on the tube .",
    "below we solve for the distortions of the wire due to the electrostatic forces .",
    "the force in the direction perpendicular to the charged wire ( denoted the @xmath40-direction ) is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42^{2}}=\\frac{c_g^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 hl^2 } , \\quad\\mathrm{with}\\,c_{g}=lc(0).\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we discuss in detail the elastic properties of a suspended nanotube .",
    "most devices are made by under - etching after depositum of the nanotube , which is done at room temperatures .",
    "therefore , since the thermal expansion coefficient of nanotubes is negative ( 100 nm wire expands a few nm from room temperature to 4 k ) it seems unlikely that there is a large tension in tube unless it becomes heavily charged@xcite . when the tube is charged it is attracted towards the metallic gates and leads .    the radial force ,",
    "off course , couples to the breathing - type modes , which , however , have too large energies ( @xmath43 30 mev ) to be relevant for the low - voltage experiment in reference  @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in the lower part of the excitation spectrum and disregard this mode .",
    "we are left with the bending and stretching modes .",
    "the energy of the bending is typically much lower than those of stretching modes@xcite , and therefore we treat these as purely classical , which means that we will solve for the bending mode separately and then via an anharmonic term this solution acts as a force term on the longitudinal mode .",
    "we thus consider two possible mechanism for coupling to the stretching mode : either directly via the longitudinal electric field discussed in section  [ sec : epar ] or through the perpendicular field , section  [ sec : eperp ] , which bends the tubes and hence also stretches it .       has after the deformation the coordinates @xmath44,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    assuming the tube to lie in a single plane and thus having no torsion in the longitudinal direction",
    ", we can describe the distortion of the bend tube by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] runs along the unbend tube in absence of external forces , see figure  [ fig : xizeta ] .",
    "( if the tube has some slack , @xmath17 is a curve linear coordinate along the equilibrium position the hanging tube . )",
    "this means that a point along the tube , which before was at @xmath47 after the deformation has the coordinates @xmath48 the total elastic energy of the tube is then follows from standard elasticity theory of an elastic string@xcite @xmath49^{2}}{2}+\\frac{ei}{2[r(x)]^{2 } } + k_\\perp^{{}}z(x)+k_\\parallel^{{}}\\;u(x)\\right )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the linear strain of extension , @xmath51 is the radius of curvature , @xmath52 the area and @xmath53 the moment of inertia , @xmath54 is young s modulus , and @xmath55 the external forces , and where we have defined the longitudinal displacement field as @xmath56 the linear extension of an infinitesimal element between @xmath17 and @xmath57 is @xmath58 or @xmath59^{2}+[z^{\\prime } ( x)]^{2}}-1\\right).\\ ] ] the linear extension elastic energy is thus @xmath60^{2}+[z^{\\prime } ( x)]^{2}}-1\\right)^2 .\\ ] ]    the curvature contribution is determined in a similar way .",

    ", we find to the same order @xmath68 ^{2}\\approx \\frac{ei}{2}{\\int_0^l}dx\\,\\left [ z^{\\prime \\prime } ( x)\\right ] ^{2}.\\ ] ] again , there is a term which couples the two modes .",
    "however , for nanotubes this term is much smaller than the last term in equation  ( [ wlinf ] ) , because it smaller by a factor @xmath69 , and hence we have neglected the coupling term in @xmath70 .",
    "as mentioned above , the bending mode itself has a resonance frequency too low to be seen tunnelling spectroscopy ( @xmath71 mhz@xcite)(even when under tension due to the charging of the wire ) , which means that it can be treated as a classical degree of freedom and franck - condon type physics is not involved .",
    "in contrast , the longitudinal stretching mode has been seen in the single - electron - transistor ( set ) device@xcite and here we wish to calculate the franck - condon coupling constants for this mode .",
    "therefore we take the following approach : first we solve for the bending mode classically and then insert this as an external force acting on the longitudinal mode .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath72 is @xmath73 this equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "one approach is to approximate @xmath74 by the average value , which is corresponds to assuming constant tension in the wire@xcite .",
    "below we solve for the bending function @xmath72 in two regimes : the linear and the non - linear regime .",
    "once we know @xmath72 , we will be interested in the _ change of @xmath72 due to tunnelling of a single electron_. for large @xmath75 , the relevant change is thus @xmath76 this change will then couple to the longitudinal mode via the coupling term in equation  ( [ wlinf ] ) .      for weak forces we can simply neglect the non - linear term in equation  ( [ eqom ] ) , and with boundary conditions @xmath77 the solution is @xmath78",
    "the shift in @xmath79 due to the charge of a single electron is according to equation  ( [ zegendef ] ) given by @xmath80 for a tube with @xmath81 0.6 nm , @xmath82 m , and @xmath83 pa and a device with @xmath84 nm , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , the maximum distortion is of order a few nm .    the linear approximation is valid when the second term in equation  ( [ eqom ] ) is much smaller than the first . using the solution in equation  ( [ smallk ] )",
    ", this translates to the condition @xmath87 for the typical parameters used below , the number on the left hand side of ( [ condition ] ) is @xmath88 , and therefore the linear approximation is only marginally valid",
    ".      for larger distortions the non - linear term in equation  ( [ eqom ] ) becomes important . in the strongly non - linear regime",
    ", we can neglect the first term and we have @xmath89 with boundary condition @xmath90 .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath91 in this non - linear regime , the change in the slope the bending function @xmath92 due to a single electron charge , is @xmath93",
    "due to the electrostatic forces the equilibrium position of longitudinal displacement field @xmath94 shifts .",
    "since the forces are small the displacement is going to be small . for the tunnelling overlap factors ,",
    "the important point is , however , whether these displacements are large compared to the quantum uncertainty length , which later is seen to be of order of pm . in this section , we calculate the classical displacements of @xmath94 .",
    "one example is shown in figure  [ fig : u ] .",
    "the displacement of the longitudinal mode is readily found from its equation of motion .",
    "the displacement due to the longitudinal electric field follows from @xmath95 with boundary conditions @xmath96 . with forces concentrated near the contacts as in equation  ( [ exx3 ] )",
    ", there is an abrupt change of @xmath94 at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : model ] red dashed curve .",
    "once we have solved for @xmath72 in equation  ( [ zegendef ] ) , we can find the force that acts on the longitudinal diplacement field @xmath99 by inserting the solution into the last term of equation  ( [ wlinf ] ) , and then identify the force @xmath100 in equation  ( [ w ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath101 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the size of the displacement follows from the balance between this force and the strain : @xmath102 which together with the boundary condition , @xmath103 , gives the solution @xmath104 ^ 2+\\frac{x}{2l}{\\int_0^l}dy\\,[z'(y)]^2.\\ ] ] one example is shown in figure  [ fig : model ] ( blue curve ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we analyze the franck - condon overlap factor due to this electrostatic distortion of the stretching mode .     due to the parallel ( red dashed curve ) and perpendicular ( blue curve ) electric fields .",
    "we have used typical parameters as in section  [ sec : fc],scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the longitudinal eigenmodes of a nanotube modeled as a 1d elastic medium follows from the hamiltonian @xmath105 where @xmath106 is mass density per unit length , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are conjugated variables , i.e. , @xmath109=i\\hbar\\delta(x - x')$ ] . in order to diagonalize @xmath110",

    "each mode represented by @xmath127 is shifted by the amounts @xmath128 this allows us to calculate the franck - condon parameters , which for each mode @xmath124 expresses the overlaps between the new eigenstates around the new equilibrium positions and the old one .",

    "even more so because the coupling strongly strength , equation  ( [ gperp ] ) , depends strongly on the length of wire , which is not seen experimentally .",
    "we have considered the electromechanics of suspended nanotube single - electron - transistor devices . when the charge on the tube is changed by one electron",
    "the resulting electric field will distort the tube in both the longitudinal and transverse directions , and both these distortions couple to the stretching mode .",
    "we have calculated they consequences for the coupling constant for vibron - assisted tunnelling expressed as the franck - condon factor .",
    "this is expressed in terms of the ratio of the classical displacement to the quantum uncertainty length . even though both are in the range of picometers , the effective coupling parameters , @xmath130 , turn out to be small for most devices .",
    "because the screening of the longitudinal electric field is very effective , the dominant interaction seems to be the coupling via the bending mode .",
    "however , only if the tube is very close to the gate do we get a sizeable @xmath130-parameter .",
    "this could indicate that in the experiment of sapmaz et al.@xcite the suspended nanotube has a considerable slack , which would diminish the distance to the gate .",
    "further experiments and more precise modelling of actual geometries should be able to resolve these issues .",
    "we thank the authors of reference  @xcite for valuable discussions . the work is supported in part by the european commission through project fp6 - 003673 canel of the ist priority .",
    "here we derive in more detail the result show in section  [ sec : electrostat ] . the interaction between two charges on points @xmath17 and @xmath151 is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the wavefunction is the perpendicular direction . by modelling the tube as a cylinder , @xmath154",
