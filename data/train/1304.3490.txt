    "single crystals of bak122 with a size up to 7x7x1 mm@xmath51 were grown from feas flux as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "potassium content in the samples was determined using electron probe microanalysis with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy ( wds ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "samples , had typical dimensions of 0.5 mm wide , 2 to 3 mm long and 0.05 mm thick , and were cut from cleaved slabs along the tetragonal [ 110 ] direction ( which becomes either the orthorhombic @xmath10 or @xmath11 axis below @xmath52 ) .",
    "optical imaging was performed on the samples while mounted on a cold finger in a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat ( allowing for precise temperature control in 5k to 300k range ) using a _ leica dmlm",
    "_ microscope .",
    "polarized light microscopy was used for visualization of the structural domains @xcite and the sample selection was based on the clarity of domains in the image . in fig .",
    "[ domains ] we show polarized light images of the area between potential contacts in bak122 crystals used in this study , with @xmath33=0.108 ( non - superconducting ) , @xmath33=0.202 ( t@xmath53=10k ) , @xmath33=0.235 ( t@xmath53=26k ) and @xmath33=0.259 ( t@xmath53=28k ) .",
    "images were taken on cooling at a temperature slightly above @xmath9 and at base temperature .",
    "the highest contrast is observed when the sample is aligned with the [ 100 ] tetragonal direction at a 45@xmath54 to the polarization direction of incident light ( parallel and perpendicular to the orthorhombic @xmath10 in different domains . )",
    "the contrast of domain images depends on the quality of the surface and the homogeneity of the samples .",
    "domains are observed for samples with @xmath55 0.26 , and are no longer observed for samples with higher doping level , @xmath33=0.34 , which also do not show any features associated with structural transition in @xmath56 .",
    "selected samples were mounted for four - probe electrical resistivity measurements , with contacts made by soldering 50 @xmath57 m ag wires using low - resistance sn soldered contacts @xcite .",
    "initial resistivity measurements on each sample were carried out using a flexible wire arrangement with no strain applied to the sample ( free standing state ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ resistivitytwinned ] .",
    "since this measurement is performed in the twinned state of the sample and contains contributions from both components of the in - plane resistivity in the orthorhombic phase , we call it @xmath58 .",
    "samples were then mounted on a brass horseshoe straining device , and strain was applied through the voltage contact wires by deformation of the horseshoe , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of the procedure .",
    "strain in this configuration is applied along the tetragonal [ 110 ] axis , which selects the orthorhombic @xmath10 axis as a preferable direction upon cooling below @xmath6 .",
    "very soft current leads apply no strain .",
    "the strain was incrementally increased , and for each increment , temperature dependent resistivity measurements were made and the domain structure was imaged to determine the completeness of detwinning .",
    "our previous studies using x - ray scattering have shown that when crystals are strained to the point at which no domains are visible in polarized microscopy , about 90 % of the whole bulk of the sample represents the domain whose orthorhombic @xmath45 axis is oriented along the direction of the strain and therefore parallel to the current . therefore in the detwinned state we are predominantly measuring the @xmath10 axis resistivity , @xmath49 , while in the unstrained state of the sample roughly equal contributions of both resistivity components are measured .",
    "therefore , we may calculate the @xmath11 axis resistivity , @xmath59(t)=2@xmath58(t ) - @xmath49(t ) .",
    "as@xmath0 corresponding to the two fe unit cell.,width=188 ]      to justify the minimal model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used here to calculate the resistivity anisotropy shown in fig .",
    "3 of the main text , we use first - principles band structure calculations .",
    "the first step is to unfold the first - principles fermi surface from the two - fe unit cell to an effective one - fe unit cell , where the two magnetic ordering vectors are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the ba122 system , due to a sizeable hybridization with the as orbitals , there are two ways to unfold the overlapping and hybridized electron bands .",
    "one consists of constructing wannier functions from a particular energy window ( usually near the fermi surface ) , symmetrizing them according to the primitive tetragonal group , and recalculating the band structure using the obtained wannier functions @xcite .",
    "this method provides a reasonable agreement of the folded bands with full dft calculations , but this agreement may be achieved not through an appropriate as - induced hybridization , but through unphysically large one - electron hopping@xmath62 the other method makes use of the actual symmetry element that reduces the larger unit cell to a smaller one : a glide plane .",
    "this method has been discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more briefly in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is this unfolding procedure that is appropriate for our purposes .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs ] we show the dft - calculated fermi surface cross - sections by the plane @xmath63 because of the body - centered symmetry the point z@xmath64 is equivalent to @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ labels ] for notations ) . therefore , the ellipticities of the electron pockets with respect to the point z are opposite to those with respect to the point @xmath66 . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs ] we show the fermi surface cross - sections in the unfolded band from which the fermi surface of the upper panel originates . in the unfolded zone , the ellipticity of the electron pockets with respect to z is the same as with respect to @xmath67 but opposite as compared to the eccentricity with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see the notation in fig .",
    "[ labels ] ) . after folding , the point @xmath68 folds upon @xmath70 , and point @xmath69 upon @xmath67 thus creating an impression that the ellipticity changes sign with @xmath71 .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath72 ( right panel ) .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs ] , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] + ( 1,0)200     ( left panel ) and @xmath72 ( right panel ) .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs ] , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] ( 0,1)100   ( left panel ) and @xmath72 ( right panel ) .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs ] , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    we note that there are two hole pockets at @xmath66z but only one at @xmath73 , indicating that the dominating scattering processes are between the hole pockets at @xmath66z and the electron pockets .",
    "this shows that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , considering a two - dimensional three band model with a circular hole pocket at the center @xmath66 of the unfolded brillouin zone and two elliptical electron pockets located at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , is an appropriate starting point . within this model ,",
    "the conductivity tensor is given by :    @xmath76 where @xmath77@xmath78 is the component @xmath79 of the fermi velocity of band @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the non - equilibrium electronic distribution function for a ( unit ) electric field applied along the @xmath82 direction .",
    "the latter can be obtained by solving the boltzmann equation in the presence of scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations , as explained in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . to obtain the results of fig .  3 , we followed the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , considering a putative magnetic quantum critical point and calculating numerically the temperature - dependent resistivity anisotropy .",
    "we used the same parameters as those of ref .",
    "@xcite , varying the chemical potential to mimic the effects of hole doping and electron doping . for each value of the chemical potential",
    ", we obtained the complete temperature - dependence of the paramagnetic resistivity anisotropy and then extracted the maximum anisotropy , obtaining the results of fig .",
    "3 .      in order to address the kinematic effect of the magnetically - reconstructed fermi surface anisotropy",
    ", we calculated the transport anisotropy using the actual dft band structure and the constant relaxation time approximation .",
    "it has been established that gga calculations , even though they overstimate the long - range ordered magnetic moment by about a factor of two , provide a better agreement with the experimental fermi surface than dmft calculations , which yield the correct magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "this is , incidentally , another manifestation that not only the local fluctuations , accounted for in dmft , but also nematic fluctuations , consistent with a short range magnetic order of several lattice parameters , are responsible for the reduction of the ordered moment @xcite . with this in mind , we used full potential lapw bands , with full gga magnetization , including spin - orbit interaction , to compute the fermi surfaces and the fermi velocities .",
    "the fermi surface calculated deep inside the magnetically ordered phase of the parent compound , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs2 ] , displays two sets of quasi - isotropic pockets : one for the holes ( blue ) and one for the electrons ( green ) .",
    "it also displays barely visible threads , corresponding to the dirac cones .",
    "they are green , indicating that in the calculations the dirac points are located very slightly below , but practically at the fermi level . shifting the fermi level up by 30",
    "mev transforms the dirac pockets into clearly visible electron tubes ( middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_suppl_fs2 ] ) , while moving it down ( right panel in fig .  [ fig_suppl_fs2 ] ) creates hole tubes instead . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermi velocity in the dirac cones is high , therefore whenever they are present , they dominate the transport . near the dirac point , the contribution from a dirac cone to transport is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the energy distance from the dirac point .",
    "using an extrafine mesh of about 60000 inequivalent k - points ( 44x44x40 divisions in the full brillouin zone ) we have calculated the transport function @xmath85 as a function of energy , separately for the hole bands and electron bands .",
    "one can see very clearly two regimes : one , where both regular and dirac electrons contribute , and the other , where the latter contribution disappears .",
    "except very near the dirac point itself , dirac electrons dominate transport .",
    "moreover , contrary to the assumption in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anisotropy comes mostly from the dirac cones , and not from the `` round '' pockets . as fig .",
    "[ anisotropybs ] shows , the total anisotropy is vanishingly small when the fermi level is crossing the dirac cones right at the dirac point , which happens for * @xmath86 * in the calculation**. * * away from this chemical potential , the anisotropy * * grows , retaining its positive value @xmath87 , for either hole or electron doping away from this point .    in the calculation ,",
    "the dirac point is very near the fermi level for the undoped compound . to determine where it is in the real material",
    ", we can use the arpes data of ref .",
    "@xcite , or preferably , the quantum oscillation measurements of ref . @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "the authors observe that in order to bring the dirac cone area into a complete agreement with the experiment , they need to shift the fermi level in their lda calculations up by 30 mev . in the former work",
    ", it was observed that the dirac points are located 30 mev below the actual fermi level . at the same time",
    ", they observed a factor of about three in the effective mass renormalization , implying that , in the unrenormalized band structure , the corresponding shift of the fermi level would be 90 mev .",
    "( upper curve ) obtained using band structure calculation , as described in the text .",
    "note that the `` as - calculated '' dirac points lie precisely on the fermi level , and the resistivity anisotropy is essentially zero . in order to match the calculated fermi surfaces with arpes and quantum - oscillation experiments ,",
    "respectively @xcite , one needs to shift the calculated fermi level * * of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , correspondingly , by 30 mev and 90 mev shifts .",
    "the resulting positions are indicated by arrows .",
    "after these shifts are applied , the minimal anisotropy ( @xmath88 ) appear at the left of the arrows , that is to say , in the hole doping regime .",
    "note that no symmetry demands that @xmath89 be less than 1 , small variation in the calculated band structure could render it slightly larger than 1 , as observed in the experiment .",
    "[ anisotropybs ] , width=264 ]    one could actually restrict the integration to particular parts of the brillouin zone and separate the dirac contribution from the rest .",
    "after that , one could shift the dirac bands by the amount suggested by the experiment , and the other bands by their measured shift .",
    "this is however unnecessary , because the anisotropy is dominated by the dirac band , and shifts of the other bands do not really matter .",
    "therefore , we calculated the total anisotropy as a function of doping , using straight dft band structure , and simply marked ( fig .  [ anisotropybs ] ) the position of the fermi level of the parent compound corresponding to the aforementioned 30 mev and 90 mev shifts .",
    "note that the minimal anisotropy , which corresponds to 0.03 - 0.1 h / fe depending on the shift , is nearly zero , but this is accidental ; it could be a small positive or a small negative number ( as in the experiment ) .",
    "dft certainly does not describe these compounds at the level of accuracy sufficient to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "yet , it consistently describes the vanishing resistivity anisotropy in the magnetically ordered phase as holes are doped into the system .",

[ theory ] . roughly , in electron - doped compounds , the hot - spots fermi velocity has a larger component along the @xmath36 direction , giving rise to a larger scattering rate for electrons travelling along this direction , implying @xmath26 . as the system is doped with holes , the hole pocket expands while the electron pocket shrinks , changing the position and the fermi velocity of the hot spots , which eventually acquires a larger component along the @xmath37 direction , implying @xmath31 . to go beyond the low - temperature paramagnetic limit and make closer connection to the experiment , we used the same model of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we attribute such behavior to the spin - fluctuation scattering in the nematic phase and to the dirac - cones contribution in the magnetically ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> both mechanisms complementarily predict a resistivity anisotropy that is larger in the electron - doped side and continuously smaller in the hole - doped side . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the change in the sign of the resistivity anisotropy can be completely understood in terms of the band structure of the pnictides , without invoking a change from itinerant to local moment physics , as suggested recently by ref .  @xcite . besides shedding light on the singular character of the nematic phase in the iron pnictides , our observation serves as a unique fingerprint for the predominance of electronic scattering due to spin fluctuations , rather than phonons , in the normal state of these superconductors . </S>",
