    "here we study ultrametric and tree matrices , the random walk they induce on trees and its potential theory .",
    "there exists a broad literature in this field ( a complete state - of - the - art study can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between our work and most part of this literature , is that our starting point is not a random walk on a tree , but a tree matrix or more general , an ultrametric matrix . in this viewpoint ,",
    "the random walk is constructed from the matrix , a nontrivial fact , even in the finite case .",
    "hence , most of the concepts must be expressed with respect to the matrix , that turns to have two representations .",
    "one in the tree as the sum of a potential and a harmonic basis . the other one in the boundary of the tree as the potential of a markov process .",
    "our results are not a simple translation of well - known results from walks on trees to matrices .",
    "new phenomenon appear : the formula for monotone harmonic functions ; the predictable representation property of tree matrices , that is the keystone for a wide class of relations including the martin kernel at @xmath0 ; the formula relating different levels of the process in the boundary which allow us to simulate it , in a constructive way .",
    "below we give the framework of our work and summarize some of the main results .",
    "an ultrametric matrix @xmath1 is a symmetric nonnegative matrix verifying the ultrametric inequality @xmath2 for all @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 is finite it was shown in @xcite , @xcite , that the inverse @xmath5 of a nonsingular ultrametric matrix @xmath6 is a diagonal dominant stieltjes matrix ( see @xcite for a linear algebra proof of this fact ) .",
    "then , @xmath6 is proportional to the green potential of a submarkov kernel @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 .",
    "thus , if we consider for @xmath9 the distance @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is an ultrametric distance and @xmath12 is a green potential ( a phenomenon that happens in @xmath13 with the newtonian potential and the euclidian distance , or in @xmath14 , when we allow an increasing function of the euclidian distance ) .",
    "tree matrices are a special case of ultrametric matrices .",
    "they are defined by a rooted tree @xmath15 ( with root @xmath16 ) and a strictly increasing function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , the level of @xmath19 , is the length of the geodesic from a site @xmath19 to @xmath16 .",
    "then , the tree matrix @xmath6 is defined as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 been the farthest vertex from @xmath16 that is common to the geodesic from @xmath22 and @xmath23 to @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath4 is finite , @xmath6 is the potential of a markov process , whose skeleton is a simple symmetric random walk on the tree , only defective at the root .",
    "me also mention here that every other ultrametric matrix is obtained by restriction of this class ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that is for every ultrametric matrix @xmath6 there exists a minimal extension tree matrix @xmath24 , defined on @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 .",
    "this minimal tree @xmath27 has all the information that is required to understand the one step transitions of the markov process associated to @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 if and only if the geodesic in @xmath27 joining @xmath22 and @xmath23 does not contain other points in @xmath4",
    ".    one of the purposes of this paper is to extend this study to countably infinite ultrametric and tree matrices .",
    "each ultrametric matrix @xmath6 defines a natural kernel @xmath29 in the boundary @xmath30 of the tree .",
    "this class of operators were already considered in @xcite and @xcite , were a deep study of potential properties is done , mainly in connection to dimension and capacity on the boundary .",
    "we show @xmath29 is a stochastic integral operator whose associated filtration @xmath31 is given by the tree structure , see proposition [ prostoch ] . the operator @xmath29 allows to represent harmonic functions in the infinite tree ( see corollary [ c201 ] ) .",
    "this representation is an alternative to the well known martin kernel representation , supplied for example in the basic reference @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we describe the set of increasing ( along the branches ) harmonic functions as those functions that can be written in terms of @xmath6 , see theorem [ p302 ] . also , we characterize the set of bounded harmonic functions which are the difference of two harmonic increasing functions ( see theorem [ representation ] ) .    in the finite setting ,",
    "a tree matrix @xmath6 is the potential of a continuous time markov chain , the leaves of the tree being reflecting states ( see proposition [ p2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the infinite transient case , each column of @xmath6 is the sum of a potential and a nontrivial harmonic function , as follows from relation ( [ re21 ] ) .",
    "this last result uses two main ingredients .",
    "the first one comes from the finite case analysis : when imposing dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundary , a finite tree matrix is the sum of the potential matrix and a matrix whose columns generate the harmonic functions ( see proposition [ p3 ] ) .",
    "the second element is the exit measure @xmath32 at the boundary .",
    "we mainly consider the potential of tree matrices for markov semigroups defective at the root , because this is natural in the finite case .",
    "but , in the transient infinite case we can reflect the process at the root as we do in section [ secc7 ] and by a limit procedure we can represent the martin kernel in a similar way as for the absorbed chain , see theorem [ th701 ] .",
    "also explicit computations for homogeneous trees are done , retrieving some known formulae ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in section [ ul5 ]",
    "we study ultrametric matrices @xmath33 . under some explicit hypotheses , we associate to @xmath6 a minimal tree matrix @xmath34 extending it , with a natural immersion of the sites @xmath4 into @xmath35 . in theorem [ p100 ]",
    "we show that a canonical generator @xmath36 can be associated to @xmath6 with the help of the generator @xmath37 associated to @xmath24 ; and in theorem [ t1 ] it is shown that the harmonic functions defined by @xmath36 can be retrieved from the harmonic functions defined by @xmath37 .",
    "the key hypothesis is that a random walk starting from @xmath38 is trapped at the cemetery or it reaches @xmath4 with probability one .",
    "let us turn to the process in the boundary of the tree .",
    "the fact that @xmath29 is an stochastic integral operator reveals to be the main property which allow us to study the generator @xmath39 . in theorem [ nucleo ] we describe the transition probability kernel of the submarkov semigroup @xmath40 acting on the boundary and having @xmath6 as the kernel potential . in theorem [ esc10 ] we supply a recursive formula satisfied by the process in terms of : the killing time , the process killed at a successor of the root , and the process starting afresh from the distribution @xmath32 .",
    "this allows us to give a constructive simulation of the process in terms of exponential random variables ( killing times ) and independent random variables distributed @xmath32 conditioned to the atoms of the natural filtration .",
    "there is a large literature on stochastic processes on the @xmath41-adic field .",
    "see for example the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "we notice that in these works there is a natural measure in the boundary , the haar measure for the @xmath42adic tree , or an absolutely continuous probability measure with respect to the haar measure for the @xmath42adic field . in our work",
    "the tree needs to be locally finite , but no other hypothesis is needed as homogeneity .",
    "even with this generality , the exit measure at @xmath0 fulfills the requirements allowing us to describe the process at the boundary .",
    "we also mention here , among others , the works of @xcite and @xcite in local fields and the work of @xcite in disconnected spaces .",
    "ultrametricity is an important tool in applied areas : taxonomy ( see @xcite ) ; the problem of maximal flow on finite graphs , namely the theorem of gomory - hu ( see @xcite ) ; statistical physics ( see @xcite ) to explore the ultrametric parisi solution to spin - glass models ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the tools we use in this work is the notion of stochastic integral operator ( s.i.o . ) , which is the natural framework in which ultrametricity appears in stochastic analysis .",
    "an operator @xmath43 acting on a space @xmath44 is an s.i.o .",
    "( see @xcite ) if for some filtration @xmath45 , @xmath43 can be written as @xmath46 the fact that @xmath47 is predictable will play a fundamental role in the analysis of @xmath29 . the characterization of s.i.o .",
    "on countable spaces leaded to study the relations between ultrametric matrices and filtrations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand the continuous version of ultrametric matrices needs to consider operators of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a bounded increasing and adapted process . in @xcite it is shown that these operators are markov potential kernels ( a proof of it that uses backward stochastic differential equations can be found in @xcite ) . this result is in the spirit and constitutes a generalization of the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "here we fix notation and recall some well - known notions on trees .",
    "let @xmath15 be a connected non - oriented and locally finite tree .",
    "@xmath4 is the set of sites and @xmath50 is the set of links .",
    "two sites @xmath51 are neighbors if @xmath52 .",

    "it verifies @xmath67 .",

    "assume that @xmath4 is countably infinite .",
    "an infinite path @xmath75 in the tree with origin @xmath76 , is such that @xmath77 for every @xmath78 .",
    "if all the @xmath79 are different this path is called an infinite chain . the following relation",
    "@xmath80 is an equivalence relation in the set of chains .",
    "the quotient set is the boundary of the tree @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) and we denote it by @xmath81    for every @xmath68 and @xmath82 there exists a unique chain of origin @xmath22 which is in the equivalence class @xmath83 , and it is called the _ geodesic _ between @xmath22 and @xmath83 , and denoted by @xmath84 . for a fixed @xmath85 and @xmath86 ,",

    "hence we can extend @xmath97 to @xmath98 by @xmath99 hence , @xmath100 and if @xmath101 then @xmath102 . in this last case @xmath103 if and only if @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
