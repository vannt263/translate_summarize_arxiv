    "there are some sport tournaments where the ranking of the competitors is based on the results of games played against each other . in the world of sport",
    "there is no consensus in using a particular ranking method .",
    "various evaluation methods have been applied to different events taking into account the specifics of the particular sport activity .",
    "further complication emerges when participants are teams , and the final ranking should also reflect individual results .",
    "one characteristic example for that situation is a chess team championship .    in this article",
    "it is assumed that the final ranking of participants of a sport tournament is based on the outcome of the games that have been played against each other .",
    "the result of a game is given according to the rules of the particular sport , however , reasonable data transformation is also allowed .",
    "ranking of the participants will be made by applying the pairwise comparison models of multicriteria decision making methodology .",
    "it has two main advantages : the obvious interpretation of the games played against each other and the ability to address the problem of intransitivity ( cyclical preferences regarding three alternatives : a is better than b , b is better than c , but c is better than a ) , a common feature of subjective evaluations by individuals , but a well - known phenomenon in objective sport results , too .",
    "the alternatives to be compared are the participants of the tournament , their game results will be incorporated into a pairwise comparison matrix , and the final result will follow the ranking of the priority vector derived from the matrix with an estimation method .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this approach can be applied not only for some real competitions ( national soccer , basketball , hockey , etc .",
    "championships , chess tournaments ) , but for the ranking of teams or individuals having historic data of their rivalry ( tennis or chess players , athletes ) .",
    "although the application of complete pairwise comparison matrices ( i.e. everybody met all the other competitors at least once ) can raise interesting questions to be analyzed ( comparison of the official rankings and those obtained by using the pairwise comparison method , for instance ) , the focus of this article is to use incomplete pairwise comparison matrices for the final ranking .",
    "this is the reason why the analyzed case is a chess olympiad : it is an ideal example of the potential application of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices .",
    "chess competitions are often organized as a swiss - system tournament .",
    "all participants face each other for a determined number of games ( rounds are often organized at the same time ) , while there is no knockout phase .",
    "it means that a loss in the first rounds does not make impossible for the contestant to win the championship , as well as all participants play the same number of matches .",
    "the final rank of the players ( teams ) is determined mainly by the application of different lexicographical orders , but it lacks a well established solution for determining the final ranking  taking into account the performance of opponents of a team is a central issue as not all possible matchings materialized , which poses a serious challenge .",
    "it will be shown that an alternative way based on the results against each other could give a ranking which is in some sense intuitively better than the currently used methods .",
    "the more detailed analysis will take the results of the 39th chess olympiad open tournament as a basis .",
    "the competition took place from september 20th to october 3rd , 2010 in khanty - mansiysk , russia .",
    "this choice was supported by the following arguments :    * it was an important sport event recently ; * results were easy to collect and to adapt to the pairwise comparison method ; * not only the winner , but the position of other participants were of interest ; * the reciprocity of the pairwise comparison matrix was a reasonable assumption ; * participants were interested in the size of their win or lose ; * the official ranking method is debated .",
    "all of these issues will be thoroughly discussed .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] the applied theory and some methods for the consistent approximation of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices will be described .",
    "section [ adapt ] deals with the representation of the tournament results in a pairwise comparison format . special features of the chess olympiad which make the necessary assumptions reasonable will also be presented here .",
    "section [ rankings ] analyzes different rankings with a focus on comparing the official result with those of calculated from pairwise comparisons .",
    "for this purpose a distance measure will be introduced .",
    "section [ characteristics ] highlights some interesting properties of the example .",
    "section [ visualization ] uses multidimensional scaling ( mds ) to draw the rankings on a two - dimensional map based on the distance defined in section [ rankings ] .",
    "it reveals that the different rankings obtained from pairwise comparisons are close to each other . in section [ conclusion ] the summary of the results and the outline of further research",
    "are given .",
    "pairwise comparisons have been widely used in decision making since saaty published the ahp method @xcite .    in a multicriteria decision making problem",
    "the @xmath0 real matrix @xmath1 is a pairwise comparison matrix if it is positive and reciprocal that is @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .",
    "the reciprocity condition also means that @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "matrix element @xmath7 is the numerical answer to the question how many times is the @xmath8th alternative more important / better / favourable than the @xmath9th? the final aim of the use of pairwise comparisons is to determine a weight vector @xmath10 for the alternatives , where @xmath11 somehow approximates the pairwise comparison @xmath7 . the solution is obvious if matrix @xmath12 is consistent , namely @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , because there exists a positive @xmath15-dimensional vector @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for all @xmath4 .    in the inconsistent case the real values of the decision maker",
    "can only be estimated .",
    "saaty proposed the eigenvector method ( em ) for this purpose , which is based on the perron theorem @xcite , as a positive matrix has a dominant eigenvalue with multiplicity one and an associated strictly positive eigenvector .",
    "distance - minimization techniques , like logarithmic least squares method ( llsm ) @xcite minimize the function @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the proper difference of @xmath7 from its approximation @xmath11 ( in case of llsm @xmath20 ) .",
    "it may happen that a subset of pairwise comparisons are unknown due to the lack of available data , uncertain evaluations , or other problems .",
    "incomplete pairwise comparison matrices were introduced in @xcite , for example ( missing elements are denoted by @xmath21 ) :    @xmath22    in order to handle incomplete pairwise comparison matrices , introduce the variables @xmath23 for the @xmath24 missing elements in the upper triangle of @xmath12 supposing reciprocity ( in all there are @xmath25 unknown entries in the matrix ) . the new matrix is denoted by @xmath26 as its elements are the functions of the variables :    @xmath27    ( in)complete pairwise comparison matrices can be represented by graphs @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be a pairwise comparison matrix of size @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , vertices correspond to the alternatives , and @xmath30 , thus @xmath31 represents the structure of known elements .",
    "a recent result in this field is the extension of em and llsm to the incomplete case @xcite .",
    "the em solution is arising from the idea that inconsistency could be measured by the maximal eigenvalue , so it is a natural approach to choose the unknown elements for minimizing the dominant eigenvalue . therefore the task is : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "as proved in @xcite , the solution is unique if and only if graph @xmath34 is connected , thus two alternatives could be compared via directly or indirectly through other alternatives .",
    "an algorithm is also proposed for the @xmath35-optimal completion based on cyclic coordinates .",
    "another opportunity is the llsm method . in this case",
    "only the known elements of @xmath12 are examined : @xmath36 ^ 2 \\ } \\rightarrow \\min$ ] .",
    "the solution is unique again if and only if graph @xmath34 is connected , thus it depends strictly on the position of known elements , not on their exact values @xcite",
    ". calculation of the optimal weights requires only the inverse of the upper - left @xmath37 submatrix in the @xmath38 laplace - matrix of graph @xmath34 and some additional matrix multiplication .",
    "the problem can be solved quickly by any commonly used office softwares , like ms excel .",
    "an example for an incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is the result matrix of a chess olympiad described in the introduction . in the 39th chess olympiad 2010 open tournament officially 149 teams participated .",
    "all of them played 11 matches , except for some teams due to their late arrivals .",
    "the matrix consists of 810 results from played matches , the ratio of known elements is small ( 7.3% ) as 11,026 elements is placed in the upper triangle of a @xmath39 matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix contains unities .",
    "there was no significant tendency in number of draws during the 11 rounds and it is the least frequent result .",
    "it implies that weaker teams played no simple draws in the final rounds , when they still had no chances to reach a good position .",
    "this is important in chess , as draws could have arranged by the mutual agreement of players .",
    "however , that possibility is not totally excluded . the distribution of results is presented in figure [ fig1 ] .    in the tournament ,",
    "all teams constituted by 5 players ( 4 and 1 reserve ) , a match between two of them includes 4 games with 3 different results ( white win or loss , draw ) . in both teams",
    "2 players have white , implying symmetricity as the chances of the match are a priori equal .",
    "the winner of the game gets 1 game point , the loser 0 , while draw means 0.5 game points for each player",
    ". therefore the final result of the match for one team , the sum of players game points , ranges from 0 to 4 , by 0.5 .",
    "if a team achieves in the match minimum 2.5 game points , it gets 2 match points .",
    "if it scores 2 game points ( thus its opponent has likewise 2 game points ) , it gets 1 match point .",
    "if it secures 1.5 or fewer game points , it counts as 0 match points for this match .",
    "the sum of allocated match points is always 2 .",
    "the official ranking method is a lexicographical order determined by the application of 4 tie - breaking procedures in sequence , proceeding from tb1 to tb4 to the extent required.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the primary criteria of the lexicographical order is tb1 , the number of match points .",
    "however , as at most 22 match points could be scored in 11 matches , tb2 rules certainly should be applied , which means that teams are strongly interested in increasing their game points , players can not be satisfied with a simple 2.5:1.5 win .",
    "consequently , the size of wins reliably reflects the difference of teams performance and it is justified to give higher weights to bigger wins .",
    "this is not the case in a lot of sport events .",
    "it was presented that match results correspond to the main conception of ratios used in pairwise comparison matrices , and they could be transformed into values ( ratios ) .",
    "draws ( 2:2 ) are obviously converted to 1 , but in the other 4 sort of results 4 different rules were applied ( reciprocity ensures that it is enough to see the results from the viewpoint of the winner ) .",
    "the variants are presented in table [ table2 ] .",
    ".transformation of match results into pairwise comparison values ( ratios ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ratio between the maximal and minimal weights has remarkable implications highlighted in the last 2 rows of table [ table7 ] .",
    "average win s ratio corresponds to the mean of wins in each coding : @xmath40 for example , it is @xmath41 for b variant .",
    "finally , power equals to @xmath42 , which reflects a kind of order of magnitude in the tournament .",
    "for example , in a variant the factor between the first and the last team is 150-fold , while a standard victory in a match corresponds to a pairwise comparison ratio of 3.2 . as @xmath43 ,",
    "a virtual chain of 5 teams should exist , where each team defeated the following with this average difference .",
    "however , if one of the first and last teams played against each other , the ratio as a known element in the incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is at most 5 according to a 4:0 win in a variant .",
    "it implies participants should be put into 4 - 5 groups .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] presents the weights derived from llsm vectors .    due to the pairing method",
    ", the classification of teams partly happens .",
    "the structure of known elements in the pairwise comparison matrix shows an impressive picture ; figure [ fig4 ] indicates them with a filled box covering approximately 7% of the whole area , which is the ratio of known elements relative to all possible matchings . on the two charts matrix rows ( teams )",
    "are ordered according to final ( a , left ) and a - llsm ( b , right ) rankings , respectively . known elements representing matches knit around the diagonal ,",
    "this effect is more stronger in the second case .",
    "it is affirmed by some calculations : the average difference between the rank of two teams played against each other is 28.70 in final and 25.32 in a - llsm , while the median is 22.5 and 19 .",
    "thus matches were taken place between contestants with a similar performance , the matching algorithm operates not randomly . despite the fact that the pairing method was not examined , the above numbers suggest that the proposed pairing based on pairwise comparisons is better regarding the classification of teams  if the number of matches is limited , they should be played between participants whose internal ranking is difficult to decide .    amid these circumstances , it is favourable that the number of rounds in the tournament remains small compared to the number of participants , as it makes possible the appearance of significant ratios not permitted by the transformation of match results into pairwise comparison ratios .",
    "it raises the question whether all countries should participate in the same tournament which is not the case in almost all team sports like soccer or ice hockey .",
    "rankings based on pairwise comparison matrices have revealed some interesting facts about the performance of certain teams , nonetheless , the long lists do not give an impressive picture about their relation .",
    "the @xmath44 distance seems to be a good starting point , as it makes possible to plot @xmath15 rankings in a @xmath45 dimensional space .",
    "in addition , it is possible to decrease number of dimensions in order to give a better overview if it goes without significant loss of information .",
    "multidimensional scaling ( mds ) is a statistical method in information visualization for exploring similarities or dissimilarities in data ; a basic book in this field is @xcite .",
    "a classical application of mds is to draw cities on a map from the matrix consisting of their air distance .    for sufficiently small @xmath15",
    ", it requires only 1 or 2 dimensions to visualize all points representing different rankings .",
    "the distance matrix of the 7 rankings is still calculated in section [ rankings ] , but the applied software ( spss v18.0 ) requires at least 10 cases to be evaluated .",
    "thus , regarding former observations , 3 further rankings ( sonneborn - berger , buchholz , mix ) were defined on the basis of different components of the original lexicographical order.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    mds maps the original distances in interval , ratio or ordinal scales ; the most general interval scale were applied . here",
    "discrepancies on the reduced - dimension map are related to the original @xmath24 distances by a linear function : @xmath47 , which means it is indifferent to multiplying the distances by a constant factor caused by choosing a different base of logarithm for @xmath44 .",
    "the goodness of mapping ( the information loss derives from dimension reduction ) is measured by kruskal s stress and rsq .",
    "the pairwise @xmath44 distances 10 rankings could be mapped appropriately in two dimensions , but one dimension is not enough .",
    "the coordinates on the mds map has no further meaning , distances on the map reflects the original distances as well as possible , while the mean of @xmath48 and @xmath49 coordinates is 0 .",
    "stress is 0.1431 , a middle - strength relation .",
    "rsq reaches 0.9468 , approximately 94.5% of variance of the scaled data can be accounted for by the mds procedure .",
    "the reduced map is plotted in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "start and final rankings are the farthest from each other , the 5 rankings derived from the incomplete pairwise comparison matrices are in a small cluster approximately at the same distance from start and final .",
    "the proposed rankings are almost the same , only d - llsm differs from the others marginally ( it gives a great weight to all wins , but hardly rewards its size ) .",
    "the 3 newly defined rankings ( sonneborn - berger , buchholz and mix ) are nearer to the final than to the start which is reassuring , while buchholz and mix are still nearer to the proposed rankings .",
    "it backs the former observation that methods based on pairwise comparison matrices overweighs tb4 ( buchholz points ) to tb2 ( sonneborn - berger points ) , while the official lexicographical order prefers teams with higher tb2 ( sonneborn - berger points ) .. ] it is not by chance , as tb4 ( buchholz points ) rather reflects the performance of opponents , the key idea beyond pairwise comparison matrices .",
    "this paper presents an alternative method to determine the final ranking of teams participated in the 39th chess olympiad 2010 open tournament based on incomplete pairwise comparison matrices . in lack of former experience",
    ", 4 arbitrary scales were used to transform the match results into ratios .",
    "two well - known techniques are used , the eigenvector method ( em ) and the logarithmic least squares method ( llsm ) .",
    "the decision between them is far from trivial , while other methods deserve testing , like the one given by fedrizzi and giove in @xcite .",
    "results show that in some cases the incompleteness of the pairwise comparison matrix has favourable effects if it has a special structure , namely , if ordering on the priority vector derived from the matrix , known elements are located near the diagonal with high probability : some ratios given by the optimal completion can significantly exceed the original scale .",
    "the chosen variant for transforming match results into ratios affects the absolute priorities significantly , but final rankings served by weights are relatively robust .",
    "it was confirmed by the application of a distance based on the asymmetry of committed mistakes in rankings , however , it was strongly influenced by some particular teams .",
    "the construction of better indices is a topic of future research .",
    "matches with the same result were represented by the same ratios .",
    "it means some simplification as a 4:0 win in the final round against a strong opponent seems to be more valuable than a similar result in the first rounds against underdogs .",
    "however , the official ranking does not take into account the opponent s strength in awarding victories , and a priori it is not reasonable to transform these outcomes differently .",
    "nevertheless , further investigations are needed how this aspect could be incorporated into the pairwise comparison method .",
    "alternative proposals revealed some oddities of the current fide olympiad tie - breaking rules .",
    "as there is no commonly accepted ranking method in chess , other techniques are worth examining .",
    "visualization implies that certain lexicographical orders , despite the lack of continuity , approximates the results of the proposed method well .",
    "while it is really impossible to find a perfect final ranking for a similarly complex swiss - system tournament , it was justified that in some cases the use of pairwise comparison matrices give robust and intuitively better results than currently used ranking techniques .",
    "this approach can be extended to other sport championships .",
