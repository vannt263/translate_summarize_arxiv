    "a soft resonance was observed for the first time by jackson and kinsey @xcite in the @xmath5 reaction for heavy nuclei @xmath6 near closed shells as an anomalous bump appearing in the quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectrum at @xmath7  mev .",
    "this resonance was called pygmy resonance ( pr ) because of its small strength compared to the known , giant dipole resonance observed in photonuclear reactions @xcite . later , a similar anomalous bump was observed for the well - deformed rare - earth nucleus @xmath8tm , but at the considerably lower energy of @xmath9  mev @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the pr in the rare - earth mass region and beyond was made by igashira _",
    "et al.@xcite , where they found that the centroid of the pr is approximately proportional to the mass number @xmath10 and varying from as low as 1.5  mev for @xmath11pr to 5.6  mev for @xmath12au .",
    "while all those studies have been performed using radiative neutron capture , the pr was recently observed also in the radiative strength function ( rsf ) derived from the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction @xcite .",
    "this supports the assumption that the fundamental origin of this phenomenon is independent of the type of nuclear reaction .",
    "_    however , in spite of the fact that the pr has been studied for a long time , the type of nuclear excitation responsible for the pr in the rsf remains unknown .",
    "theory @xcite predicts an @xmath13 pr around @xmath14  mev in @xmath15pb .",
    "the origin for the pr in this calculation is a supposed concentration of electric dipole strength in few low - energy states composed of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 neutron configurations which are relatively weakly coupled to the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) .",
    "this model suggest a quite strong pr which is not supported by experimental data .",
    "however , recently some indications in @xmath19 experiments for the existence of a weak @xmath13 pr in lead nuclei have been discussed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypothesis has been suggested @xcite that the pr observed at @xmath9  mev in the quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectra of well - deformed rare - earth nuclei and the so - called ` scissors mode ' excitation studied by the nuclear resonance fluorescence method ( nrf ) @xcite have the same physical origin .",
    "this would imply @xmath20 multipolarity for the pr and is supported by the similarity of the measured resonance parameters in the quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectrum on the one hand , and the averaged properties of individual @xmath20 transitions seen in nrf experiments on the other hand .",
    "finally , one can not exclude the possibility that the multipolarity of the pr can be different for different nuclei , i.e. , one has to deal with different phenomena in different mass or energy regions . in conclusion , while the commonly - called pygmy resonance is most probably a _ dipole resonance ,",
    "the _ electromagnetic character of this soft dipole mode remains unknown .",
    "_ _    in nrf experiments , one can , in principle , measure the multipolarity and character of the involved @xmath0 transitions , but one is usually limited to the investigation of the soft dipole resonances built on the ground state .",
    "even so , for reliable results above @xmath21  mev , one should prefer the use of a polarized photon beam over common compton polarimeters @xcite .",
    "anyway , in order to study average properties of the soft dipole modes built on excited states , one has to analyze quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectra .",
    "to do so using a polarimeter might prove very hard , since the soft dipole mode is in general a weak resonance superimposed on the rather large tail of the gedr @xcite giving a very low signal - to - background ratio in the analysis .",
    "unfortunately , with the exclusion of compton polarimetry , there are no other known direct experimental methods to determine the electromagnetic character of soft dipole modes in quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectroscopy . in this work ,",
    "we propose the possibility to determine the character of soft dipole modes solely by using quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectra from two different types of reactions , namely the @xmath1he,@xmath4 and the @xmath22 reactions applied to the study of the same nucleus .",
    "this will enable us to study soft dipole modes built on excited states and their response to finite nuclear temperature .",
    "the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction is used for the extraction of level densities and rsfs from primary @xmath0 spectra @xmath23 for excitation energies @xmath24 between 0 and the neutron binding energy @xmath25 and for spins between 2 and 6@xmath26 .",
    "the fundamental assumption behind the extraction procedure is the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite which implies that the probability of radiative decay in the statistical regime , represented by the primary @xmath0 spectra , can be expressed simply as a product of the final - state level density @xmath27 and the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient @xmath28 @xmath29 the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient is now proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the rsf of the multipolarity @xmath32 .",
    "the details of the experimental extraction procedure have been described in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the total rsfs has been obtained from such experiments and analyzed for the @xmath33dy and @xmath34yb nuclei .",
    "it has been established that the total rsf can be readily described by the sum of    * the tail of the gedr as given by the kadmenski - markushev - furman ( kmf ) model @xcite with a fixed nuclear temperature fitted to the experimental data * the lorentzian - shaped , single - humped spin - flip giant magnetic dipole resonance ( gmdr ) located around 7  mev of excitation energy * a lorentzian - shaped soft dipole mode or pr , where the resonance parameters were determined from experiment @xcite .",
    "although the centroid , width and strength of the soft dipole mode could be determined from experiment , its electromagnetic character could not .",
    "thus , the question still remains open , whether it is of @xmath13 or @xmath20 type .",
    "the remaining of this work is therefore devoted to describing a method of determining the character of soft dipole modes observed in quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectra .",
    "in the @xmath22 reaction with thermal neutrons , the compound state @xmath35 is formed with spin and parity @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the spin and parity of the target nucleus .",
    "the most intense two - step @xmath0 cascades ( tscs ) accessible to experimental study populate low - lying excited states with excitation energies @xmath38 up to around 1  mev @xcite .",
    "thus , tscs start from the initial ( compound ) state @xmath35 with a certain spin and parity to a final state @xmath39 through all possible intermediate levels @xmath40 with excitation energies from @xmath38 to @xmath41 .",
    "the possible spins of the intermediate levels @xmath42 are determined by the multipolarities in the tscs .",
    "assuming that the most intense tscs have dipole multipolarity , the most probable spin interval for the intermediate level can be defined as @xmath43\\leq j_j\\leq\\min\\left[j_i+1,j_f+1\\right].\\ ] ]    assuming the validity of the statistical theory , the intensity of tscs between @xmath44 levels is determined by the partial and total radiative widths of both , the initial @xmath45,@xmath46 and intermediate @xmath47,@xmath48 levels , respectively @xmath49 partial radiative widths of any arbitrary level @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the rsf @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the energy spacing of levels having the same spin and parity as @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the total radiative width is determined by the sum of all partial radiative widths @xmath54 summed over all @xmath0 transitions populating levels @xmath55 lying below @xmath50 in excitation energy , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the multipolarities of the transitions in a tsc depend on the spins and parities of the connected states . here , we assume that the main contributions come from @xmath13 and @xmath20 @xmath0 transitions . also some @xmath57 strength will be present , but is neglected in the present discussion . thus ,",
    "if the parities of the initial @xmath35 and final @xmath39 states are different , the @xmath58 and @xmath59 sequences of transition multipolarities are possible . in the case of equal parities of the initial @xmath35 and final @xmath39 states , the @xmath0-transitions of the tscs have @xmath60 and @xmath61 multipolarities . because there is in general",
    "no possibility to distinguish between primary @xmath62 and secondary @xmath63 transitions in the cascade , transitions in tsc experiments has been attempted in , e.g. , @xcite ] the observed spectrum with the total tsc energy @xmath64 is symmetric with respect to the energy @xmath65 and is determined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the density of intermediate levels populated by tscs , and the sums run over all possible combinations of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we notice that the quasicontinuous @xmath0-spectra from both , the @xmath1he,@xmath4 and the @xmath22 reaction are determined by the same level densities and rsfs .",
    "this allows us to use the quantities which can be extracted from the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction in order to calculate the quasicontinuous spectra of tscs following thermal neutron capture . in the following ,",
    "we will mainly focus on the influence of the unknown electromagnetic character of the soft dipole mode on calculated tsc spectra .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we first consider the tsc with the @xmath58 sequence of transition multipolarities .",
    "if the soft dipole mode is of @xmath20 character , the corresponding strength function @xmath71 should be added incoherently to the spin - flip gmdr strength function @xmath72 giving the total magnetic dipole strength function @xmath73 .",
    "the same is correct for the radiative widths @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath13 strength function is then completely determined by the tail of the gedr ( modeled in this work by the kmf approach ) .",
    "the intensity of @xmath58 tscs can therefore be written as @xmath75}{\\gamma_j } \\label{eq : intcas1}\\ ] ] or @xmath76 .",
    "\\label{eq : intcas2}\\ ] ]    in the case of the soft dipole mode being of @xmath13 character , the total electric dipole strength function @xmath77 is given by the incoherent sum of the kmf strength function @xmath78 and the soft dipole resonance @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath58 cascade can then be expressed as @xmath80 .",
    "\\label{eq : intcas3}\\ ] ] the ratio of the cascade intensities ( [ eq : intcas2 ] ) and ( [ eq : intcas3 ] ) is finally determined by @xmath81 } { \\left[1+\\frac{\\gamma^{\\mathrm{sd}}_{jf}(e_{\\gamma_2 } ) } { \\gamma^{\\mathrm{sf}}_{jf}(e_{\\gamma_2})}\\right]}. \\label{eq : intcas4}\\ ] ]    one can see that this ratio depends on the ratios of the soft dipole and the kmf - gedr strength function and on the ratio of the soft dipole and the spin - flip gmdr strength function for primary ( @xmath82 ) and secondary ( @xmath83 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "it is known from ref .",
    "@xcite that the spin - flip gmdr strength function @xmath72 is less than @xmath84% in magnitude than the tail of the gedr strength function @xmath78 according to the kmf model .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the intensity of the calculated tscs will be higher in the case of @xmath20 character of the soft dipole resonance under study than for @xmath13 character , provided that the parities of the initial and final state are opposite .",
    "the main differences in the calculated tsc spectra for the two possible characters of the soft dipole mode are expected to be located around its centroid , i.e. , in the region of @xmath85  mev for deformed rare earth nuclei .    by analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : intcas2 ] ) and ( [ eq : intcas3 ] ) , similar expressions can be written for the @xmath59 sequence of multipolarities in the tsc . for the @xmath60 and the @xmath61 sequences ,",
    "i.e. , for equal parities of the initial and final state , the situation is more complex and it is more difficult to draw conclusions from simple relations similar to eqs.([eq : intcas1]-[eq : intcas4 ] ) . in general",
    ", one can state that in these cases , the calculated tsc intensities will be higher for @xmath13 than for @xmath20 multipolarity of the soft dipole mode under study , but the differences between the two calculations are smaller than in the case of opposite parities of the initial and final state .    in order to investigate the intensity difference of calculated tsc spectra due to the two possible characters of the soft dipole resonance",
    ", we have calculated such spectra according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) for the two even - even nuclei @xmath86dy and @xmath87yb and the odd nucleus @xmath88dy . for all of these nuclei ,",
    "the level density and total rsf , as well as the resonance parameters of the soft dipole mode have been obtained from @xmath1he,@xmath4 experiments @xcite",
    ". we will investigate tscs populating the first @xmath89 level of the @xmath86dy and @xmath87yb nuclei .",
    "the initial states ( which are formed at @xmath25 ) have mainly spin and parity @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the @xmath86dy and @xmath87yb nuclei , respectively .",
    "thus , we can investigate the @xmath60 and @xmath61 sequences of tscs in the case of the @xmath86dy nucleus and the @xmath58 and @xmath59 sequences in the case of the @xmath87yb nucleus .",
    "the @xmath88dy nucleus is interesting because it has two low lying levels @xmath92 and @xmath93 which are very close in excitation energy ( 0 and 25.6  kev respectively ) and which have the same spin but opposite parity .",
    "the initial state ( formed by thermal neutron capture ) has @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we can investigate @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 cascades for the same nucleus .    because the spin interval accessible for @xmath0-transitions",
    "is different for the @xmath1he,@xmath4 and @xmath22 reaction , a spin distribution of the level density has to be taken into account .",
    "we assume the spin distribution according to @xcite @xmath95,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the excitation - energy dependent spin cut - off parameter .",
    "furthermore , we assume equal amounts of levels with positive and negative parities for all relevant spins and excitation energies .",
    "the calculated tsc spectra for the different nuclei and final states are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : even ] and [ fig : odd ] .",
    "the calculations were carried out for both possible characters of the soft dipole mode , giving two solutions .",
    "the summed intensities of all tscs ( the integrals over the tsc spectra ) populating a fixed low lying level are shown in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "the results of the calculations show that the two possible electromagnetic characters of the soft dipole resonance yield different spectral distributions of tscs as well as different summed intensities . in the more favorable cases where the parities of the initial and final states are opposite",
    ", the summed intensity differs between 30% for @xmath87yb and up to a factor of two for @xmath88dy with the @xmath20 multipolarity for the soft dipole mode resulting in the higher intensities .",
    "the spectral distributions give differences of up to a factor of two to three at energies which correspond to the centroid of the soft dipole resonance and show markedly different shapes .",
    "for the less favorable cases where the parities of the initial and final states are equal , the differences in summed intensities amounts only to 15% for the @xmath86dy nucleus and @xmath9745% for the @xmath88dy nucleus with the @xmath13 multipolarity giving the higher intensities .",
    "the spectral distributions for the two possible electromagnetic characters differ between 25% and a factor of two around the centroid of the soft dipole resonance .",
    "again the shapes of the tscs spectra show differences as well .",
    "thus , we see that the intensity of the tsc transitions can depend strongly on the character of the soft dipole resonance under study",
    ". the effect should certainly be large enough to be measured experimentally , especially for tscs with opposite parities of the initial and final states connected by the tsc transitions .",
    "this fact should open the possibility to use the experimental measurements of tsc spectra to determinate the character of soft dipole modes observed in the analysis of @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction data , i.e. , using solely quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectroscopy .",
    "it should be noted that the statements and conclusions discussed above are based on some fundamental assumptions .",
    "the most important of these is that the @xmath0 emission in both reactions discussed is of statistical nature . for the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction",
    ", this means that the decay properties of the ensemble of reaction selected states within a certain energy bin are independent of whether these states are directly populated by @xmath98 particles through the nuclear reaction or by @xmath0-transitions from higher excited states .",
    "this is believed to be approximately fulfilled because the relatively long life time of the excited states ( @xmath99  s ) gives the nucleus time to thermalize prior to radiative decay .",
    "the same is assumed for the @xmath22 reaction , i.e. , it is assumed that the reaction proceeds through a compound state which has a long life time and that the radiative decay properties of this compound state are independent of its formation .",
    "it is also assumed for both reactions that the mean values of the radiative widths @xmath100 are independent on the structure of the connected states and are defined by the relevant level spacings and rsfs .",
    "these assumptions have been partly tested for the @xmath86dy nucleus @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the measured total @xmath0-ray spectrum of the @xmath88dy@xmath101dy reaction with kev neutrons can be very well reproduced by using the level density and rsfs obtained from the @xmath102dy@xmath1he,@xmath103dy reaction .",
    "additionally , for the @xmath86dy nucleus , the essentially same level density and rsf have been obtained from the @xmath86dy@xmath1he,@xmath104he@xmath105dy reaction @xcite .",
    "these results strongly support the statistical model for the radiative decay in these reactions and the correctness of the extraction procedure for level densities and rsfs in the case of the @xmath104he induced reactions .    a second difficulty in the above outlined method to measure the multipolarity of soft dipole resonances comes from the fact that the extraction procedure for level densities and rsfs applied to the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction allows us to get only the total rsf , i.e. , the incoherent sum of all multipolarities . decomposition of the total rsf into strength functions connected to definite multipolarities is determined by corresponding models used to describe the @xmath13 and @xmath20 strength in nuclei .",
    "this model dependent analysis can , in principle , give additional uncertainties to the analysis of tsc spectra .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that if one tests only widely accepted models of @xmath13 and @xmath20 strength functions in well - deformed rare earth nuclei , the total rsf extracted from the @xmath1he,@xmath4 reaction allows one to select only the kmf model with a constant nuclear temperature for the tail of the gedr , a single - humped lorentzian for the spin - flip gmdr resonance , and a lorentzian for the soft dipole mode . from this point of view",
    ", the measurements of tsc spectra can also be considered as an additional test of this decomposition .",
    "finally , investigating the same residual nucleus by the @xmath1he,@xmath4 and @xmath22 reaction , requires two target nuclei with neutron number differing by two units .",
    "if we restrict the search to stable targets of well - deformed rare - earth nuclei , only 22 of such pairs of target nuclei exist between gd and hf.he,@xmath4 and @xmath22 experiments have been devoted to well - deformed rare - earth nuclei . ] unfortunately , until now , there is , to our knowledge , no published data set from both reactions populating the same residual nucleus .",
    "thus , the analysis outlined in this work can not be performed without additional experimental efforts .",
    "we have shown that a joint experimental investigation of the same product nucleus by the two different reactions @xmath1he,@xmath4 and @xmath22 , can be used to determine the character of soft dipole resonances observed in the rsf .",
    "the first reaction is used for extracting the level density and the total rsf of the residual nucleus . the subsequent decomposition of this total rsf into the tail of the gedr , the gmdr , and",
    "the soft dipole resonance is model dependent and subject to possible systematic errors .",
    "the second reaction can then be used to determine the character of the soft dipole resonance via the measurement of tsc intensities .",
    "the most suitable tscs for this analysis are those with opposite parity of the initial and final level .",
    "the results from the @xmath22 experiment can also be used as an additional test for the correct decomposition of the total rsf obtained from the @xmath1he,@xmath4 experiment into modeled electric and magnetic dipole strength functions .",
    "finally , the exclusive use of quasicontinuous @xmath0 spectra for determining the character of soft dipole modes gives us , in contrast to typical nrf experiments , for the first time the opportunity to study soft dipole resonances built on excited states and their response to finite nuclear temperatures .",
