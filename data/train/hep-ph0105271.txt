    "one could imagine to build a special kind of experimental facility to study high - energy and very - high - energy neutrinos . while on the wishful thinking , one could gather all the best conditions .",
    "desirable characteristics include :    * to provide acceleration of parent particles up to the highest energies ; * to be coupled to the largest particle beam dump ; * to be shielded by a set of the largest and most dense absorbers available ; * to be monitored by an ensemble of several detectors , each operated with a different detection technique , and complementary acceptances ; and * to produce and detect neutrinos covering a broad range of energies , perhaps from @xmath1ev to @xmath2ev .    does it sounds like a too difficult enterprise ?",
    "well , we get very close to it , if we regard all cosmic - ray phenomena and corresponding experiments in a complementary way .",
    "think of several cosmic particle acceleration mechanisms , provided by sources such as supernova explosions , neutron stars in binary systems , active galactic nuclei , gamma - ray bursts , pulsars , rapidly spinning magnetars and yet some exotic objects ( topological defects , decaying massive relics ) .",
    "choose as target our planet , where gravitationally trapped gaseous elements serve as a beam dump , and the solid core material , from one surface to the other , provide at the same time shielding and support for different purpose detectors , scattered around at different heights and depths .",
    "a block diagram of this `` ultimate '' high - energy facility looks like :    @xmath3    a more realistic sketch for this omnipresent experimental neutrino facility is presented in figure  [ fig : device ] .",
    "one should consider the whole cosmos as part of the figure .",
    "one may also include several detectors scattered around , with different and complementary purposes , for example : optical and gamma - ray space telescopes ; primary cosmic - ray satellite and balloon borne calorimeters ; mountain - altitude cosmic - ray family emulsion chamber detectors ; cherenkov , fluorescence and particle extensive air shower detectors ; muon magnetic spectrometers ; and yet large underground , underwater and under - ice observatories .",
    "high - energy extraterrestrial neutrinos ( above tens of tev ) may be directly produced at the same ( galactic or extra - galactic ) sources of high - energy cosmic - ray particles and gamma - rays , including those of the highest energies .",
    "low energy neutrinos ( below tens of mev ) are produced directly in nuclear reactions at the core of the sun .",
    "intermediate energy neutrinos are produced locally , at the planetary scale . a cosmic accelerated primary particle",
    ", a nucleon for example , impinging upon nuclei of air in the atmosphere , will generate a shower of secondary particles , which may propagate to the ground or even below .",
    "the main contributions to air showers come from the prodution of a ) neutral pions , giving rise to electromagnetic cascades ( a sequence of photons and electron - positron pairs ) ; and of b ) charged mesons ( mainly pions and kaons ) , giving rise to hadronic cascades .",
    "charged - meson decays will give rise to neutrinos and muons ; these muons on their turn may eventually decay into neutrinos , all contributing to what is called the _ conventional atmospheric neutrino flux_@xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decay of heavy quark particles , produced in the hadronic cascades initiated by cosmic - ray interactions , also gives rise to atmospheric neutrinos , a particular set known as the _ prompt atmospheric neutrino flux_.    these prompt neutrinos are the subject of the present talk . among the motivations for their study ,",
    "we highlight the following :    * high energy neutrino telescopes - + though neutrinos are the most abundant cosmic rays at sea level , their measurement requires large underground detectors , in order to compensate for the small neutrino - nucleon cross section . nowadays operational neutrino telescopes , like amanda@xcite and baikal@xcite ,",
    "are taking and analizing data .",
    "they are being optimized to increase signal , data statistics and energy coverage , and to reduce the background , mainly caused by muons and by electronics limitations .",
    "other similar and much larger instruments are being contemplated ( antares , nestor , nemo , icecube)@xcite . as will be shown later",
    ", there is the possibility that prompt neutrinos are observable in such neutrino detectors@xcite .",
    "* background to cosmic neutrinos - + the measurement of galactic and extra - galactic neutrinos , which is the main purpose of neutrino telescopes , is of course limited by discrimination against atmospheric neutrinos , the prompt component included . *",
    "bounds to charm production cross section - + the actual measurement of prompt neutrinos , or the failure to do so , will impose constrains to the charm production cross section at high energy@xcite , in a similar way as it has been done through the investigation of muon poor horizontal air showers@xcite . *",
    "proton small - x gluon pdf - + it has been shown that the spectral index of the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux may depend linearly on the slope of the gluon distribution function at very small @xmath4 , not reachable at colliders@xcite .",
    "* background to high energy neutrino oscillations - + prompt decay of the charm - strange meson @xmath5 provide the unique _ direct _ source of high - energy tau - neutrinos in the atmosphere , which may compete with those coming from flavor oscillation of atmospheric or extraterrestrial muon - neutrinos@xcite .",
    "why charm turns out to be of such particular interest to the study of high energy neutrinos ?",
    "the answer comes easily from the analysis of the _ critical energy _ of different neutrino - parent particles produced in cosmic - ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the critical energy delimits the competition between decay and interaction lengths , that is to say , above this energy the parent particle is likely to interact or be slowed down , rather than to decay into a neutrino .",
    "table  1 compares the critical energies calculated for muons , pions and kaons ( parents of the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux ) and for relevant charm baryons and mesons ( parents of the prompt flux ) .",
    "while the contributions of the conventional component to the neutrino flux are constrained below 1  tev , the charm prompt decays - although less copious - represent the _ only _ atmospheric contribution up to around 100,000  tev .    in what follows we present an outline of the calculation of the prompt neutrino component in the atmosphere , comparing different phenomenological approaches found in the literature .",
    "next we discuss the implications of the different prompt flux scenarios upon the detectable signals in large scale neutrino telescopes .",
    ".[table : pdg ] critical energies @xmath6 of selected particles .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^ \" , ]",
    "the calculation of the prompt lepton flux in the atmosphere is subjected to large uncertainties . partially because of our imprecise knowledge of certain atmospheric particle showering parameters .",
    "further uncertainty is associated with the extrapolation to high energy of a variety of models describing the accelerator data on charm production .",
    "care must be taken when comparing results from different calculations , for the combination of ingredients may shift the fluxes up or down .",
    "once the uncertainties are quantified , in terms of an allowed band for the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , we come to the result that prompt neutrinos may be observable in a kilometer - scale neutrino telescope . actually , it may be possible that a small component of prompt neutrinos are already present in the observed samples of the ongoing experiment amanda , given their current limit on the atmospheric neutrino flux@xcite .",
    "of course , the existence of a direct observational window for prompt neutrinos depends on the actual bounds to extragalactic neutrino fluxes and , in the case of tau - neutrinos , on the actual values of the flavor oscillation parameters , which are currently subjects of great interest and of intense research .",
    "the actual measurement of prompt neutrinos , and even the failure to do so , will certainly impose constrains to the charm production cross section , at energy domains not yet accessible to particle colliders@xcite .",
