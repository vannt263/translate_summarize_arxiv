    "we generally consider that those quantum advantages are due to unique features of quantum world such as the superposition and the quantumness of correlations like entanglement and quantum discord . indeed",
    ", entanglement and quantum discord are shown to be resources for some quantum information tasks .",
    "however , different criteria are used to distinguish quantum from classical worlds and various measures are applied in quantifying the quantum correlations .",
    "entanglement is a well studied quantum correlation and it plays a clear role in bell inequalities , teleportation and superdense coding ect .",
    "the history of entanglement study can trace back to einstein , podolsky , rosen who considered this spooky action at a distance in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement seems not account for all quantum correlation in bipartite system since the absence of entanglement does not eliminate all signatures of quantum behaviour .",
    "henderson and vedral @xcite , ollivier and zurek @xcite proposed a quantity of nonclassical correlation , which is named as quantum discord , to measure the discrepancy of total and classical correlation .",
    "it is thus a measure of quantumness of correlation .",
    "quantum discord is shown to be present in a mixed state quantum computation algorithm , the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) , which offers the quantum advantage but with negligible entanglement .",
    "it is then considered that quantum discord plays a key role in this algorithm .",
    "alternatively , some other proposals are also discussed dqc1 @xcite . in the past years , great progress have been made in understanding entanglement and various measures of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "recently , it is found that discord consumption can be related with the quantum advantage for encoding information @xcite .",
    "this is a clear evidence that quantum discord can be considered as a resource for quantum information processing like the role of entanglement in teleportation . in this protocol ,",
    "quantum advantage is upper bounded by the consumption of discord during the encoding information and is lower bounded by the difference of discord consumption and classical correlation .",
    "thus , quantum discord consumed during encoding can quantify the advantage about coherent interactions .",
    "this operational significance of discord has enlightened our knowledge of quantum correlation other than entanglement .",
    "on the other hand , quantum discord is quantum measurement dependent .",
    "its quantity depends on the positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) or projection measurement @xcite .",
    "we know that quantum measurement is one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics . instead of the strong measurement such as the projection measurement which will cause completely collapsing of the wavefunction of a quantum state ,",
    "a measurement scheme called `` weak measurement '' , which only induces partial collapsing of the quantum state , is indispensable @xcite .",
    "as we known , weak measurement plays a key role in the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and has practical applications @xcite .",
    "now , it seems natural to consider a weak measurement scheme for quantum discord @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is very recently found that weak measurement can recover the quantum discord and preserve the fidelity of quantum teleportation for some decoherence channels @xcite .",
    "it is understandable that the accessible information by weak measurement will be smaller than that of a projection measurement which is strong , so the residue correlation will become larger .",
    "the result is that we may obtain extra quantumness of correlation by weak measurement .",
    "while the standard quantum discord is shown to be a valuable resource , then the question is whether this new defined quantumness of correlation which is larger is also useful . in this paper",
    ", we will provide a positive answer to this question ! we can prove that for two - qubit pure state and bell - diagonal state , this super discord induced by weak measurement can indeed be consumed during the encoding information and therefore can be regarded also as a precious resource in this quantum protocol .",
    "our finding reveals that more resources of quantum correlation might be explored by weak measurement .",
    "this highlights the fundamental role of weak measurements in studying quantum correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    ", we first give a brief review of the definition of quantum advantage , the formulism of the projective measurement and weak measurement .",
    "in section , we prove that super discord by weak measurement can achieve the best quantum advantage , for which the quantum correlation is completely consumed , in the case of general pure entangled states and the bell - diagonal states .",
    "section is the summary and discussion .",
    "for a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 shared by alice and bob , in general , the total correlation between the two subsystems is measured by mutual information , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath3 is the density matrix of system @xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the reduced matrices of the state @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "classical correlation accessible by measurement is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of all possible measurements that performed locally only on subsystem @xmath11 on bob s side .",
    "so the quantum discord@xcite is defined as the difference between those two correlations @xmath12    for normal quantum discord , the measurement acting on one side refers to the povm or projective measurement .",
    "a povm with @xmath13 ( @xmath13 is the dimension of system ) outcomes is a @xmath13-tuple of operators@xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the conditional state @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the probability of the outcome @xmath18 . for two - qubit system ,",
    "we know that the best measurement that bob can perform to get information about alice s system @xmath19 is a projective measurement onto the state of system @xmath11 .",
    "suppose @xmath10 are the elements of projective measurement , we can assume @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "very recently , gu _ et al_. @xcite consider the operational significance of discord consumption during encoding information within state @xmath0 , where the discord is obtained by the povm . in this paper",
    ", we mainly follow this scheme but apply it to the more general case .",
    "next , we present the details of the scheme .",
    "alice encodes an arbitrary feasible @xmath22 with probability @xmath23 onto her subsystem @xmath19 by application of unitary operator @xmath24 . after encoding",
    ", the state becomes @xmath25 and is given to bob .",
    "bob uses some decoding protocols to get the best possible estimate of the encoded data @xmath22 from @xmath26 .",
    "the holevo accessible information can used for this scheme .    before proceed , we consider that bob has no access to @xmath11 but can access @xmath19 , the amount of information accessible to bob is given by , @xmath27 , here @xmath28 .",
    "this case can be considered as that bob can not access any of the correlations between the two subsystems .",
    "next , the scheme is divided into two different cases .",
    "first , bob can perform any measurements on the whole system @xmath26 to retrieve the encoded random variable @xmath22 . for this case ,",
    "@xmath29 stands for the information that bob can obtain , where @xmath30 .",
    "second , bob is allowed to implement only the local measurement on @xmath19 or @xmath11 . if bob firstly measures on system @xmath11 then @xmath19 , he can obtain the maximal information defined as , @xmath31 , here @xmath32 is the quantum conditional entropy .",
    "alternatively , bob first measures on @xmath19 then @xmath11 , @xmath33 is the information that bob can obtain and @xmath34 , @xmath35 means measurement on system @xmath19 .",
    "we take the maximum value between @xmath36 and @xmath33 as the optimal information @xmath37 .",
    "we can find that @xmath38 is the difference of obtained information between coherent measurements and local measurements .",
    "it can be considered as the extra quantum advantage which is induced by only coherent interactions in the whole process .",
    "it is proven that the following inequality must hold for any @xmath0 under any feasible measurements , @xmath39 we know that @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the amount of discord consumed during encoding and classical correlation after encoding respectively .",
    "if there is no discord between alice and bob , then the quantum advantage can not exist . if the encoding is the maximal encoding , we have @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a maximally mixed state regardless of @xmath44 .",
    "so the classical correlation of the state after encoding @xmath45 is zero . for the maximal encoding ,",
    "the quantum advantage is exactly equal to the discord consumed during encoding . for this case",
    ", we consider the quantum advantage as the best quantum advantage .",
    "when alice and bob have no discord at the beginning , the quantum advantage is meaningless . in that way",
    ", coherent interactions will be no use for bob to retrieve the encoded information .",
    "aharonov - albert - vaidman @xcite came up with the weak measurement formalism , where the system interacts weakly with the measured tool .",
    "the system is disturbed weakly and the coherence may not be destroyed completely .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the projective measurement which is strong and results in complete decoherence of the system .",
    "however , any projective measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements , which change the quantum state gradually and in the end result in the same outcomes .",
    "further more , any measurement can be generated by weak measurements , so weak measurements are universal @xcite .",
    "weak measurement plays both a fundamental role in quantum theory and can have physical applications @xcite .",
    "quantum discord can also be defined for weak measurement and it is shown to be larger than the standard quantum discord based on projective measurements @xcite .    for weak measurement , a measurement with n - tuples of outcomes can be simplified to having two outcomes , and the weak measurement operators are given as @xcite @xmath46 @xmath47 where , @xmath48 , representing the strength of the measurement process , and @xmath49 , if @xmath50 , when @xmath51 , @xmath52 is weak measurement , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orthogonal projectors with @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the identity .",
    "for the superposition state @xmath57 , we can let @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are orthogonal to @xmath61 .",
    "explicitly , the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath62 @xmath63 under the condition of the maximal encoding , we will show that for different measurements , the best quantum advantages are different .",
    "we introduce the generalized pauli matrices @xmath64 in @xmath13 dimension , where @xmath65 , here @xmath66 is an orthonormal basis .",
    "these operators constitute a basis of unitary operators , see for example @xcite .",
    "when @xmath67 , we recover the standard pauli matrices , @xmath68 for a general pure entangled state of bipartite system @xmath69 where @xmath70 are schmidt coefficients and satisfy @xmath71 .    _ the two - qubit pure state._ in the following , we will restrict our attentions on two - dimensional case .",
    "the two - qubit pure state studied is @xmath72 .",
    "we first consider the projective measurement acting on the system , and follow the scheme presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quantum discord of @xmath73 is given as , @xmath74 we consider the encoding as applying pauli matrices and identity with equal probability , so the state after encoding becomes as , @xmath75 from eq.([abe ] ) , we can find , @xmath76 , where @xmath45 and @xmath77 are the classical correlation and the discord of the state after encoding , respectively .",
    "the amount of discord consumed during encoding is @xmath78 .",
    "next we calculate quantum advantage , here the measurement acts on @xmath11 of the state @xmath26 , the minimum of condition entropy is given as @xmath79 . from the encoding scheme ,",
    "we obtain @xmath80 thus the quantum advantage is obtained as , @xmath81 we can find that the consumption of quantum discord @xmath82 is equal to quantum advantage .",
    "thus it is the best quantum advantage which corresponds to the maximum encoding .    as an example , for maximally entangled pure state @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 , the best quantum advantage and the consumption of quantum discord is @xmath85",
    ".    now let us turn to the weak measurement .",
    "the measurement operator acting on the system is given as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "similarly we can obtain the other coefficients when @xmath4 is negative , the probability is , @xmath91 .",
