    "since the suggestion of @xmath0 suppression as a signal of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation by matsui and satz @xcite in 1986 the problem of quarkonium dissociation in hot and dense strongly interacting matter has played a key role for qgp diagnostics in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the original idea was that in a qgp the string tension of the confining potential vanishes and the residual one - gluon exchange interaction undergoes a debye screening by the color charges of the plasma .",
    "when the temperature dependent debye radius @xmath1 ( the inverse of the debye mass @xmath2 ) becomes shorter than the bohr radius of the charmonium ground state ( @xmath0 ) then the mott effect @xcite ( bound state dissociation ) occurs and the corresponding temperature is @xmath3 .",
    "this simple idea grew up to a multifacetted research direction when not only in the first light ion - nucleus collisions at the cern na38 experiment , but also in proton - nucleus collisions at fermilab @xmath0 suppression has been found so that there is not only a qgp but also a cold nuclear matter effect on charmonium production , see @xcite for a recent review . if one wants to explore the question of screening in a plasma more in detail then a variety of appraoches is available in the literature , from the original debye - hckel approach @xcite where one can study any vacuum potential ( for example the cornell potential ) and see its medium modification , over the thermodynamic green functions approach to the ab - initio studies of heavy - quark potentials in lattice qcd . with the obtained medium - dependent potentials one can then study the bound state problem by solving the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation or , more systematically",

    "there is an intriguing disagreement between the mott temperatures deduced from these spectral functions and those of the potential models : the latter are much smaller than the former ! from the lattice data for quarkonium correlators one",
    "has extracted @xmath5 while in potential model calculations @xmath6 .",
    "this problem has lead to the discussion of the proper thermodynamical function to be used as a potential in the schrdinger equation .",
    "should it be the free energy or the internal energy ?",
    "we will not follow this question in the present work , but refer to @xcite and references therein .    here",
    "we examine a simple model of screening as derived from one - loop calculations in thermal quantum field theory , and make a small extension of this result by putting the internal fermion lines in a constant temporal gauge field which mimics confining gluon dynamics ( polyakov - loop potential ) . in our approach the medium is made of plasma of massless quarks , described by the chirally symmetric phase of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model of qcd @xcite .",
    "confinement is implemented in the most simple way by coupling the system to the poyakov loop variable - resulting in the so called polakov loop njl - model ( or pnjl model ) .",
    "recently it has been successfully used to reproduce lattice data @xcite or to describe light meson physics at finite temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "given the self energy ( polarization function ) of a boson that mediates the interaction , the screened potential is given by a resummation of one - particle irreducible diagrams ( `` bubble '' resummation = rpa ) @xcite @xmath7~ ,   \\label{vsc}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath8 , @xmath9 as the unscreened vacuum potential .",

    "its inverse is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath17 is related to the polyakov loop variable defined by @xcite @xmath19 the physics of @xmath20 is governed by the temperature - dependent polyakov loop potential @xmath21 , which is fitted to describe the lattice data for the pressure of the pure glue system @xcite . after performing the color- , flavor- and dirac traces and making the fermionic matsubara summation , we obtain in the static , long wavelength limit @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the debye mass , the number of degrees of freedom is @xmath24 and @xmath25 is quark distribution function @xcite .",
