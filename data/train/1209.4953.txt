    "quantum walks ( qws ) , a quantum version of classical random walks ( crws ) @xcite , is a relatively simple class of systems , yet containing almost all the essential aspects of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "they can be used to model a large number of phenomena @xcite , such as : energy transport in biological systems @xcite ; bose - einstein condensates redistribution @xcite ; quantum phase transition in optical lattices @xcite ; and decoherence processes @xcite .",
    "but , certainly where qws have attracted more interest is in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "in fact , qws allow the development of new quantum algorithms @xcite , which often display much better performance than their classical siblings @xcite",
    ".    qws usefulness in applications is in great part due to their unusual transport properties .",
    "for instance , they present exponentially faster hitting times @xcite ( the time necessary to visit any vertex in the system graph space ) , an important feature for searching in discrete databases @xcite . such faster spreading compared to crws @xcite is usually attributed to interference @xcite , a key ingredient in implementations @xcite and believed central to explain distinct behaviors @xcite .",
    "however , exactly how these effects emerge in qws usually is not totally characterized @xcite , posing challenges as to how one could properly link the high degree of entanglement in qws @xcite with interference . furthermore ,",
    "since interference actually comes from a high proliferation of paths ( after all , qws are associated to the idea of crws @xcite ) , it also bears on the problem of how decoherence @xcite can make the `` quantum trajectories '' to become classical @xcite .    in trying to understand interference in qws ,",
    "a path integral - like treatment would be appropriate .",
    "actually , a few interesting works along this line have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , they address the problem from a different perspective , using combinatorial analysis to compute final states @xcite , but not considering intermediary steps in terms of feynman s history of trajectories @xcite .",
    "hence , interference is not made truly explicit .    in the present work",
    "we show how quantum interference determines qws uncommon diffusive properties . to this end",
    ", the exact green s function @xcite  given as a general sum of paths  is written in a closed analytical form .",
    "then , we describe how to calculate relevant quantities in a way identifying the trajectories superposition contributions . to concretely illustrate the approach , we show that the usually observed : ( a ) complicated oscillatory behavior of the probability distribution for visits at different sites ; and ( b ) the process dispersion dependence on time ; are associated to the complex multiple reflections and transmission patterns of the system evolved paths .    finally , we mention some important technical aspects .",
    "there are several ways to formulate qws , all defined in discrete spaces ( graphs ) @xcite .",
    "also , time may be either a continuous @xcite or a discrete variable . in the latter ,",
    "the major formulations are coined @xcite and scattering @xcite qws . continuous time and coined are related through appropriate limits @xcite , whereas coined and scattering are unitarily equivalent in any topology and for arbitrary transition amplitudes @xcite .",
    "hence , we consider only scattering quantum walks ( sqws ) , keeping in mind that our finds can be extended to such other constructions as well .",
    "moreover , the green s function method considered here @xcite is valid for any graph topology .",
    "although for our purposes we address qws on the line , avoiding extra and unnecessary mathematical complications , we mention that the same type of analysis would likewise work in more complex networks .",
    "we assume an undirected 1d lattice of equally spaced vertices labeled in @xmath0 , fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "pairs of neighbor vertices are joined by a single edge . to each edge",
    "we ascribe two basis states .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for the edge between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) we have @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , the full set @xmath8 spans all the possible system states @xmath9 .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath10 ( hereafter for short @xmath11 ) represent the propagation direction along the lattice ( or graph ) .",
    "the discrete dynamics is given by the one step time evolution operator @xmath12 , such that the state at times @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related by @xmath15 .",
    "for an arbitrary phase @xmath16 $ ] , we have @xcite @xmath17 here @xcite ( with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) @xmath20 , & \\qquad & r_{j}^{(\\pm ) }   = r_j \\exp[i \\phi_{r;j}^{(\\pm ) } ] , \\label{eq : condition - scattering}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] guarantee the evolution unitarity .",
    "the @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s can be understood as the vertices reflection and transmission quantum amplitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the problem is fully described by the green s function approach in @xcite .",
    "consider the walk starting at the edge @xmath23 ( between the vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) with the state direction @xmath24 and finally getting to the edge @xmath25 ( between the vertices @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for any @xmath28 ) .",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) it is not specified what is the final direction quantum number , @xmath42 , when arriving at @xmath25 .",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) .",
    "there are different contexts for which we may seek the amplitude transition @xmath47 .",
    "common ones are : ( i ) exactly after @xmath48 time steps ; and ( ii ) when the system never visits vertices further to the left and to the right than , respectively , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( e.g. , for first passage time calculations ) . in both",
    "we just need two extra relations for eq .",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) obviously @xmath58 . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the correct green s function would be @xmath60 .",
    "the above exact expression is derived from a sum over infinite many `` scattering paths '' @xcite , starting and ending at the edges @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "its advantage is that all the possible quantum walk trajectories are  compacted \" into a closed formula .",
    "so , distinct interference phenomena can be extract from @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , as demonstrated in @xcite , this is achieved in a rather systematic way by means of two differential operators . the probability for @xmath47 in exactly @xmath14 time steps",
    "is given by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the step operator .",
    "to see it , we note that @xcite @xmath64 , for each @xmath65 being the contribution of a trajectory from @xmath23 to @xmath25 in @xmath14 steps @xcite .",
    "interference comes into play when we take the modulus square of such expansion .",

    "( [ eq : path - operator ] ) the @xmath69 s and @xmath70 s are the scattering amplitudes ( appearing @xmath71 and @xmath72 times ) characterizing the path associated to @xmath73 @xcite .    with this mathematical ` machinery ' , below we can make an analysis of sum over paths for qws .",
    "suppose the initial state @xmath74 , so we write @xmath75 above , some @xmath76 s are zero since certain basis states are absent , e.g. , @xmath77 can not be reached in @xmath14 steps .",
    "in fact , exactly @xmath78 @xmath76 s are not null .",
    "next , to make contact with crws , we observe that by leaving from the edge corresponding to @xmath79 there is a determined number of trajectories ( eventually none ) finally getting to specific edges in exact @xmath14 steps .",
    "thus , the total number of paths ending up in any possible @xmath80 is @xmath81 . since @xmath82 , the @xmath76 s can be given as the sum of the quantum amplitudes @xcite of all paths yielding @xmath83 .",
    "as an simple example , for @xmath84 the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] schematically illustrates the basis states expansion of @xmath85 ( up to @xmath86 ) .",

    "( [ example - fig3 ] ) , is represented in the @xmath87 case of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] by an arrow pointing to the vertex @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , its number , here just a single arrow , means there is only one path getting to @xmath89 from @xmath92 if @xmath87 : a trajectory which initially heading right at @xmath2 ( since @xmath84 ) , reverses its direction at @xmath2 , goes to @xmath1 ( first step ) , and finally goes to @xmath91 ( second step ) , now heading left .",
    "note that in terms of a quantum scattering process , it represents a reflection from the vertex @xmath2 ( @xmath93 ) and then a transmission through the vertex @xmath1 ( @xmath94 ) .    by applying @xmath95 on @xmath96 and afterwards simply setting @xmath97  @xmath98 , one directly finds that the number of paths leading to @xmath83 after @xmath14 steps is given by the binomial coefficient @xcite @xmath99 as a simple check , one can test eq . ( [ eq : num - paths ] ) with the schematics in fig [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "moreover , from the mapping between sqws and coined qws in @xcite , the number of paths to a given @xmath100 state for the latter qw formulation is trivially derived from @xmath101 as @xmath102 which agrees with the formula in ref .",
    "@xcite ( with @xmath103 ) .",
    "assume any path taking , regardless the order , @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) steps to the left ( right ) .",
    "it would lead the system to @xmath106 . reversing this reasoning , consider a fixed @xmath107 , with @xmath108 .",
    "paths for which @xmath109 are both integers will result in @xmath110 . to obtain all such paths , we should consider @xmath61 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the contribution from each path to a given coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : as ] ) will involve exactly @xmath14 position dependent amplitudes @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s . in this way , the actual procedure to calculate the @xmath76 s is to compute @xmath115 , for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 as above .    for complete arbitrary @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s and for @xmath14 in the hundreds , any available computer algebra system can be used to obtain the @xmath76 s as explained . actually , vertex - dependent quantum amplitudes can give rise to a great diversity of diffusive properties @xcite .",
    "so , the present procedure may be useful to test distinct qws models transport features , helping to choose sets of @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s more appropriate in different applications ( examples to appear elsewhere ) .    however , a real surprise is for the situation when superdiffusion takes place even for @xmath2 independent quantum amplitudes and when at each single step the qw resembles an unbiased classical walk ( i.e. , @xmath119@xmath120 probability to go right - left ) @xcite . in the following ,",

    "this is possible because different paths correspond to a different order of scattering processes along the lattice . nevertheless , if the final set of scattering s coincides , the resulting amplitudes @xmath129 are equal .",
    "the total number of paths for @xmath130 is @xmath131 , which agrees with eq .",

    "( [ eq : condition - scattering ] ) , between reflections and transmissions in a trajectory .",
    "in fact , for each path the number of directions change along the way is @xmath133 .",

    ", we consider the @xmath76 s for the final states @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the case @xmath86 of fig .",

    "( [ eq : hyper ] ) we get @xmath148 and @xmath149 . to understand why , note that from @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitudes ] ) or by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we find there are six ( four ) possible paths leading to @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) . for @xmath152 ,",
    "three paths have two ( @xmath153 ) direction changes and three have four ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "the phases are then , respectively , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "hence , these two groups of paths suffer destructive interference . on the other hand , for @xmath157 there are four possible paths , all with two direction changes ( @xmath153 ) and thus with a same phase .",
    "the paths therefore build up a relatively high amplitude .",
    "the above results can also explain two typical and important behaviors observed in qws @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( a)-(c ) ) : ( i ) for usual crws , the probabilities for the particle location are gaussian distributed , with a standard deviation of @xmath158 ( insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanically the @xmath159 s , representing the particle distribution along the graph , are not spatially concentrated ; ( ii ) @xmath160 vs. @xmath100 presents stronger oscillations for the @xmath100 s far away from the initial @xmath2 , a pattern usually without a classical analog .",
    "in fact , both ( i ) and ( ii ) originate from a similar mechanism . for a fixed large @xmath14 , the number of trajectories @xmath101 leading to @xmath100 is large ( small ) if @xmath161 is small ( large ) . in the classical case , since there are no interference , the probabilities are directly proportional to @xmath101 and the gaussian distribution naturally emerges ( recall that binomial distributions , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : num - paths ] ) , converge to gaussians ) . in the quantum case , the many cancellations coming from opposite signals for distinct groups of trajectories , eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitudes - rt ] ) , prevents the probabilities at @xmath161 small to be much higher than those at larger @xmath161 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( a)-(b ) .",
    "hence , a more balanced distribution among the states @xmath100 s is obtained . by the same token ,",
    "the smooth ( strong oscillatory ) behavior for @xmath161 small ( large ) is due to the fact that varying @xmath100 in such interval will proportionally cause a small ( large ) change in the number of paths contributing to @xmath160 .",
    "this results in a slow ( rapid ) variation of @xmath162 as function of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the observed system fast spreading , e.g. , in the unbiased case characterized by a linear dependence on @xmath14 for the standard deviation ( @xmath163 ) : @xmath164 ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ( c ) ) ; is due to ( i)-(ii ) . in their turn , ( i)-(ii )",
    "are a direct consequence of intricate interference effects among paths with different phases .",
    "summarizing , our contribution here has been twofold .",
    "first , we propose a distinct approach  based on a true sum over paths history  to study qws in general .",
    "it leads to some exact analytical results , which may be difficult to obtain by other means .",
    "second , we properly quantify a fundamental characteristic of qws , interference , explicit associating such phenomenon with the emergence of supperdiffusive behavior .",
    "hence , the present framework provides a powerful tool to test distinct aspects of qws evolution , and whose complete comprehension is certainly an important step towards making qws more reliable to distinct applications as in quantum computing .",
