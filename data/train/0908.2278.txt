    "ytterbium atom is employed in a number of projects aimed at studying fundamental problems of modern physics by means of atomic physics .",
    "a large parity - violating signal on the @xmath10 - @xmath11 408-nm transition of yb has been recently observed at berkeley  @xcite . a search for the cp - violating ( t- , p- odd ) permanent electric dipole moment of yb was initiated  @xcite .",
    "a bose - einstein condensate in a dilute gas of the ground - state yb atoms has been attained  @xcite and a number of experiments with ultracold yb atoms has been carried out ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "here we focus on the optical lattice clock applications of yb . in the optical lattice clocks ,",
    "neutral atoms are trapped in a standing wave of a laser light ( optical lattice ) operated at a certain `` magic '' wavelength  @xcite . at this wavelength",
    "a differential light perturbation of the two clock levels vanishes exactly . using yb atom in lattice clocks",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimentally demonstrated in boulder  @xcite .",
    "apart from numerous technical applications , such atomic clocks may be used for searching for a variation of fundamental constants  @xcite , mapping out atom - wall interaction  @xcite , and serve as a basis for quantum information processing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present paper , we evaluate dynamic electric - dipole polarizabilities of the clock states , @xmath10 and @xmath12",
    ". dynamic polarizabilities of real and imaginary frequencies are linked to a variety of important atomic and molecular properties .",
    "in particular , we compute magic wavelengths , the effect of black - body radiation on the frequency of the clock transition , atom - wall interaction constants @xmath13 , and , finally , long - range molecular van der waals coefficients @xmath14 for the clock states .",
    "we take advantage of a close link between these properties and improve our theoretical predictions by referencing to measured properties , such as the first magic wavelength  @xcite and the van der waals coefficient for two ground - state atoms  @xcite .",
    "ytterbium has been studied both experimentally ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretically ( see , e.g. , @xcite . trapping and cooling schemes were discussed and implemented , the frequency of the clock transition was measured to a high accuracy  @xcite , the first magic wavelength  @xcite and the van der waals coefficient for the ground state of yb were also measured  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies are not free from a controversy",
    ". calculated polarizability of the yb ground state reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is in a disagreement with most of other _ ab initio _ or semi - empirical analyses .",
    "the source of this disagreement is explained below and the discrepancy is resolved . the resolution is closely related to the role of the excitations from the core which are discussed in detail .",
    "corresponding statement can be formulated as a general theorem : _ consider a second - order transition matrix element , involving summation over a complete set of intermediate states .",
    "then , a contribution from a subspace spanned by degenerate states does not depend on mixing of these states_. this statement has implications not only for computing polarizabilities , but also for the two - photon transition amplitudes , parity - violating amplitudes , etc . in yb and other atoms .",
    "in this section we start by recapitulating expressions for dynamic polarizability and its relations to magic wavelengths , and atom - atom and atom - wall interaction coefficients .",
    "next we discuss our computational relativistic many - body method .",
    "the ac stark shift of an energy of a spherically - symmetric , @xmath15 , atomic state @xmath16 in electro - magnetic wave of amplitude @xmath17 and frequency @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where the electric - dipole dynamic polarizability reads ( we use atomic units in which @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) @xmath23 here @xmath24 is an electric dipole operator and summation is over a complete set of many - body states .",
    "_ magic _ laser frequency @xmath25 is found from the condition that the ac stark shifts of both clock states @xmath16 and @xmath26 are identical so that the frequency of the transition does not depend on the laser intensity , @xmath27 simply , at the magic frequencies , @xmath28 .",
    "clock frequency shift due to black - body radiation is expressed in terms of the difference of static polarizabilities of the two clock levels ( see detailed discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also require atomic polarizabilities evaluated at purely imaginary frequencies @xmath29 these are used in evaluating the atom - wall interaction constant @xmath13  @xcite @xmath30 and the van der waals coefficients @xmath14 . for",
    "two separated atoms in states @xmath26 and @xmath16 , @xmath31 the @xmath14 for two atoms interacting in identical states is subsumed by the above formula .",
    "eq.([eq : c6 ] ) is derived under assumption that there are no downward dipole transitions from either @xmath26 or @xmath16 state , which holds in our case .",
    "it is clear that for computing the polarizabilities , we need to determine electric dipoles and energies , and to perform the summation over a complete set of atomic states . to this end",
    ", we use a combination of the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method and the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) to construct an effective hamiltonian for two valence electrons ( the ci+mbpt method  @xcite ) .",
    "further , we employ the dalgarno - lewis method  @xcite to reduce the summation over a complete set of many - electron states to solving an inhomogeneous system of linear equations .",
    "the ground state configuration of yb is @xmath32 and most of the low - energy excited states correspond to configurations with one of the @xmath33 electrons being excited .",
    "all these states can be represented to a relatively high accuracy as states with two valence electrons above a closed - shell core .",
    "this is the starting point of our calculations : the computational ( ci ) model space is spanned by all possible excitations of the two valence electrons .",
    "implications arising from the states with excitations from the outer @xmath34 core sub - shell will be discussed below .",
    "the effective ci+mbpt hamiltonian for two valence electrons has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the single - electron part of the relativistic hamiltonian @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the two - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath39 in these equations , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the conventional dirac matrices , @xmath42 is the dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) potential of the closed - shell atomic core ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 is the correlation operator .",
    "it represents terms in the hamiltonian arising due to virtual excitations from atomic core ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath45 corresponds to the standard ci method .",
    "@xmath46 is a single - electron operator .",

    "@xmath47 is a two - electron operator .",
    "it represents screening of the coulomb interaction between the two valence electrons by the core electrons .",
    "we calculate @xmath44 in the second order of the mbpt .",
    "we use a b - spline technique  @xcite to construct a complete set of single - electron orbitals .",
    "we use 40 b - splines in a cavity of radius @xmath48 and calculate the eigenstates of the @xmath42 dhf hamiltonian up to the maximum value of the angular momentum @xmath49 . the same basis is used in computing @xmath50 and in constructing the two - electron states for the valence electrons .",
    "30 out of 40 lowest - energy states for every @xmath51 up to @xmath49 are used to calculate @xmath44 and 14 lowest states above the core are used for every @xmath51 up to @xmath52 to construct the two - electron states .",
    "the two - electron valence states are found by solving the eigenvalue problem , @xmath53 using the standard ci techniques . calculated and experimental energies of a few lowest - energy states of yb are presented in table  [ energies ] .",
    "one can see that the pure _ ab initio _ energies are already close to the experimental values . however , for improving the accuracy further , we re - scale the correlation operator @xmath46 by replacing @xmath54 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) in each partial wave @xmath55 by @xmath56 .",
    "the rescaling factors are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "these values are chosen to fit the experimental spectrum of yb .",

    "@xcite are smaller , most of the shift canceling out while taking the difference in eq.([eq : bbr ] ) .",
    "note , however , that a somewhat smaller uncertainty reported in @xcite is mostly due to overestimating the theoretical accuracy for polarizabilities , especially for the ground state .",
    "see sections [ mixing2 ] and [ polarizabilities ] for details .",
    "it is worth emphasizing , that at the time of writing , the bbr correction is the leading uncertainty in the error budget of the lattice clocks  @xcite .",
    "the present calculations demonstrate a difficulty of atomic theory in determining this important correction accurately .",
    "we hope that our analysis would motivate a further experimental work , for example , on cryogenically cooled clock chambers to reduce ( and ultimately to accurately determine ) the bbr shift .",
    "we calculate the atom - wall interaction constants @xmath13 and the van der waals constant @xmath14 for both clock states using the formulae ( [ eq : c3 ] ) and ( [ eq : c6 ] ) . the results are presented in table  [ tb : c3c6 ] together with the results of other calculations and measurements for the @xmath14 coefficient for the ground state .    for two yb atoms in their ground states",
    "we find @xmath82 ( ci+mbpt with rescaled @xmath83 to fit the energies ) .",
    "however , from our calculations of the polarizabilities we know that the contributions from the excitations from the @xmath34 core state are likely to make the results smaller .",
    "therefore , we rescaled the central point for @xmath84 at twice the rate as for the polarizability of the ground state ( i.e. , reduced it by 6.5% ) .",
    "this moves the the central value to 1909 a.u .",
    "since the @xmath14 is obtained as a quadrature of the square of polarizability , we assign a fractional uncertainty to @xmath14 as twice as large as that for the static polarizabilities .",
    "note a good agreement of the ground - state @xmath14 with recent experimental determinations  @xcite and with calculations  @xcite .",

    ", this contribution is substantial .",
    "for example , for the ground state result is increased from 2.09 to 3.34 a.u . due to @xmath87 . as a large fraction of @xmath13 value is accumulated due to the core excitations , assigning error to @xmath13 is difficult for example , to estimate error in @xmath13 for simpler alkali - metal atoms in ref .",
