    "among over @xmath12 eclipsing binaries discovered in the _ kepler _ mission @xcite , more than @xmath13 are suggested to host tertiary ( third body ) companions through their eclipse timing variations ( etvs ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of them are hierarchical triples consisting of a short - period binary and an outer third body on a wide orbit .",
    "the hierarchy is often attributed to the perturbation from the third body , as in the well - known kctf ( kozai cycles with tidal friction ) scenario @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent etv analyses @xcite have revealed many hierarchical triples with misaligned tertiary orbits , whose mutual inclinations exhibit suggestive peaks around @xmath14 in agreement with the kctf prediction @xcite .    on the other hand , at least @xmath15 or more hierarchical triples seem to have well - aligned orbits , as suggested by eclipses due to tertiary companions @xcite . three - dimensional geometry and absolute dimensions of those systems are also of interest because their hierarchy may argue for the mechanism of orbital shrinkage that do not require high mutual inclinations between the inner and outer binary planes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter , we focus on a tertiary event observed only once in the kic 6543674 system , which involves three tertiary eclipses around a single inferior conjunction of the third body ( figure [ fig : tertiary ] ) .",
    "although this event has already been reported @xcite , the information obtained from its detailed modeling has not yet been clarified .",
    "below we will show that the tertiary event plays two crucial roles in determining the system configuration .",
    "first , it constrains the mutual inclination between the inner and outer binary orbits very precisely , in a similar way to the  planet  planet eclipse \" known in the _ kepler _ multi - transiting planetary system(s ) @xcite . secondly , and less trivially , it fixes the mass ratio of the inner binary and velocity of the third body even without spectroscopy .",
    "the present letter reports precise geometry and absolute dimensions of the kic 6543674 system .",

    "the above seven new parameters are fitted , while the others are floated within the @xmath198 boundaries from the etvs and phase curve ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we then perform an mcmc run from the solution , fitting all the model parameters simultaneously with the joint likelihood @xmath199 .",
    "the resulting constraints are summarized in the fourth column of table [ tab : results ] along with other derived parameters .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : tertiary ] , our model well reproduces the observed tertiary eclipses . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the information newly derived from the tertiary eclipses .",
    "tertiary eclipses on both of the inner two stars suggest a well - alignment between inner and outer binary planes .",
    "this naive expectation is quantified by our modeling .",
    "we obtain @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( see figure [ fig : diagram]b ) as the line - of - sight and sky - plane inclinations of the tertiary orbit . combined with @xmath202 , these results indicate an extremely flat orbital configuration , with the @xmath198 upper limit on the mutual inclination being @xmath203 .",
    "another role of the tertiary event is to determine the mass ratio @xmath45 and the tertiary - to - primary velocity ratio @xmath204 during the event , where @xmath205 is the orbital velocity relative to the center of mass of the inner binary .",
    "the constraints are invaluable because they allow us to determine the mass ratios of all three bodies .",
    "it is even possible , in principle , to combine them with the etv amplitude to fix the absolute dimensions of the whole system from photometry alone .",
    "the two quantities , @xmath45 and @xmath204 , are closely related to the timings and durations of the three tertiary eclipses .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : diagram]a shows the approximately one - dimensional motion of the inner binary in the sky plane with respect to its center of mass ( red and blue sinusoidal lines ) . here the motion of the third body ( green line ) is represented by an almost straight line owing to its long orbital period . for @xmath206 , eclipses occur at the intersections of the two lines in this diagram .",
    "thus , the green line should cross either of the red or blue sinusoids at the times of three tertiary eclipses ( vertical dashed lines ) , roughly within the primary / secondary radii ( vertical error bars ) .",
    "the condition essentially fixes the amplitude of the blue sinusoid and the slope of the green line , which correspond to @xmath207 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath204 is further constrained by the relative durations of the first and third tertiary eclipses , where the relative velocities between the two stars are @xmath208 and @xmath209 , respectively .",
    "these ratios yield the relative mass of the third body as well .",
    "using @xmath163 , @xmath168 , @xmath84 , @xmath87 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 we already derived , @xmath204 is converted to @xmath98 .",
    "since this @xmath210 should satisfy kepler s third law , we obtain @xmath211 which can be solved for @xmath119 as @xmath212\\left(1+\\frac{m_\\b}{m_\\a}\\right).\\label{eq : mc / ma}\\ ] ] the mass ratios derived in this way are listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "these values indicate that the system is dynamically stable , according to the criterion by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the timings of the three eclipses alone allow for other configurations , though they do not fit the eclipse shapes well and hence are rejected ( figure [ fig : diagram_others ] ) .",
    ", a radial velocity follow - up is also useful to confirm our solution independently of the possible systematics discussed in section [ ssec : phasecurve ] . ]",
    "those in panels ( c ) and ( d ) yield too short durations for the third eclipse due to the head - on crossing with one of the inner binary .",
    "moreover , the solutions are unphysical because the values of @xmath98 are so small that @xmath213 is required in equation ( [ eq : ac / ra ] ) .",
    "the solution in panel ( b ) , which is the retrograde version of the best solution , fits the light curve better than those in ( c ) and ( d ) ; however , large residuals remain around the first and third tertiary eclipses because @xmath74 is slightly smaller than @xmath70 . similarly to @xmath170 , the constant @xmath59 could also be related to the third - body temperature by @xmath214 , which is also listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the value of @xmath122 thus determined , however , should be considered as a rough upper limit because @xmath59 includes contaminations from nearby sources and/or systematics in the phase - curve modulation .",
    "combined with the etv amplitude in equation ( [ eq : aetv ] ) , the mass ratios above can be further used to determine the absolute masses of the system as @xmath215 correspondingly , absolute radii are obtained from @xmath216^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath168 . the constraints on the absolute dimensions , however , are very weak ( see table [ tab : results ] ) due to the strong correlation @xmath217 as implied by equations ( [ eq : mc / ma ] ) and ( [ eq : m_abs ] ) .",
    "the constraints are significantly improved with a better constraint on either @xmath77 or @xmath119 . to demonstrate this , we repeat the above joint analysis with the gaussian prior on the primary mass @xmath218 based on the value in the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) . here",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath119 are chosen to be fitting parameters instead of @xmath98 and @xmath151 , where the former two are converted to the latter using equations ( [ eq : aetv ] ) and ( [ eq : ac / ra ] ) . the results are summarized in the last column of table [ tab : results ]",
    ". while the constraints on the geometry and relative dimensions are almost unchanged , the absolute masses and radii of all three stars are now determined to the precision similar to the prior constraint . if we also adopt the kic effective temperature for the primary , we obtain @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the dimensions are consistent with the dartmouth isochrone @xcite of @xmath221 and suggest that the inner two stars have entered the subgiant branch and that the third body is an m dwarf @xcite , though the conclusion is sensitive to the priors on @xmath77 and @xmath222 .",
    "in this letter , we determine the geometry and physical properties of the hierarchical triple system kic 6543674 using the _ kepler _ photometry alone . especially , the tertiary event analyzed here enables us to obtain ( i ) mutual inclination between the inner and outer binary planes , and ( ii ) mass ratio of the inner binary and instantaneous orbital velocity of the third body .",
    "our analysis clarifies the value of the tertiary eclipses in hierarchical systems with the clear and textbook - like example of the event .",
    "the methodology presented here is basically applicable to other hierarchical systems involving tertiary eclipses on both of the inner stars , though more sophisticated models of the eclipse light curve and/or etvs may be required to accurately model those systems with smaller @xmath163 and/or @xmath223 .",
    "here it is worth noting that the kic 6543674 system has the longest @xmath224 among the known triply eclipsing hierarchical triples .",
    "the flatness of the system we find ( within a few degrees ) may have interesting implications for the the origin of the closest binaries , though it is not clear at this point how it compares to the large sample of misaligned triples @xcite as predicted by the kctf scenario . in this context ,",
    "a large eccentricity of the third body is intriguing because it may argue for the excitation of the inner orbit s eccentricity on the octupole order ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in any case , the relative / absolute dimensions of the system as constrained here will be useful for testing those possible alternatives .",
    "although the absolute dimensions derived above are based on the kic value , which is of limited reliability , they can be made more accurate with the follow - up spectroscopy to better constrain the stellar photospheric parameters and/or to measure radial velocities , even if they only cover the inner binary orbit .",
    "in addition , follow - up photometry of another tertiary event will pin down @xmath224 far more precisely , and can also give us some insight into the dynamical interaction in the system .",
    "in fact , the non - detection of the second tertiary event in the _ kepler _ data , which would have occurred around @xmath225 from our result , suggests that the actual period is @xmath226 longer than our estimate and that the second event was hidden in the data gap of about @xmath227 centered around @xmath228 .",
    "the fact also motivates the ground - based observation of the next event , which would be around july in 2015 .",
