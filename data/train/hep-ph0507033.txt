    "the study of lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes offers a good opportunity for shedding light on the possible physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "muon - to - electron ( @xmath0 ) conversion in nuclei @xmath2 is commonly recognized as one of the most sensitive probes of lepton flavor violation and of the related physics behind it ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .    at present , on the experimental side there is one running conversion experiment , sindrum ii  @xcite , and two planned ones , meco  @xcite and prime  @xcite .",

    "can be classified as photonic and non - photonic . in the former case",
    "the conversion is mediated by the photon exchange between the lfv leptonic vertex and the ordinary electromagnetic nuclear vertex .",
    "the non - photonic mechanisms are based on the 4-fermion contact lepton - quark lfv interactions .",
    "these two categories of mechanisms differ significantly from each other since they receive different contributions from the new physics and require different treatment of the effects of the nucleon and the nuclear structure .    in the present paper",
    "we continue studying the non - photonic meson exchange mechanism of conversion .",
