    "recent works ( e.g.  bear & soker , 2016 ; akashi 2016 ) have sparked interest in the subject of higher order multiples at the heart of planetary nebulae ( pne ) and the role they might play in forming the most unusual and/or asymmetrical pne , particularly given the large fraction observed in solar - like main sequence stars ( raghavan  2010 ) .",
    "however , to - date , there is no confirmed triple central star known .",
    "one of the best candidate triple central stars is nsv19992 , the bright star near the apparent centre of the pn suwt  2 .",
    "@xcite reported that this star is , in fact , a binary system consisting of two a - type main sequence stars with an orbital period of 4.9 days .",
    "neither of these stars could provide the ionising flux for the nebula , and as such hypothesise that the a - type binary may form part of a triple system along with the nebular progenitor . combining data from multiple sources ,",
    "they find some evidence for shifts in the systemic velocity of the binary that would be consistent with a possible third component .",
    "however , the morphology of suwt  2 ( jones  2010 ) is that of a rather canonical bipolar , seemingly inconsistent with the predicted `` messy '' structures for triple evolution ( bear & soker 2016 ) . in order to probe the possible triple system ,",
    "@xcite acquired high - resolution vlt - uves spectra of nsv19992 over the course of one - year , finding that there was no appreciable shift in the systemic velocity over the entire observing period .",
    "furthermore , with the binary parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) they derive , much of the data from @xcite phases well , with no need for a shift in systemic velocity ( jones & boffin 2016 ) . collectively , this is strongly indicative that the a - type binary does not for a triple system with the nebular progenitor .",
    "additionally , the as the systemic velocities of the nebula and a - type binary are found to differ by more than 15 km s@xmath4 , it seems unlikely that the two are in any way connected and rather that the a - type binary is just a field star which , by chance , lies close to the projected centre of the nebula .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , @xcite also find that the bright star near the projected centre of pn m3 - 2 is a binary system comprised of two a - type main sequence stars , this time with a @xmath52 day period .",
    "the chances of finding a chance alignment of a double a - type binary and a pn is slim ( but not impossible ) , the probability of finding two such chance alignments is , however , exceptionally small .",
    "this might perhaps be taken as an indication that there may be some connection between the systems , for example , that one of the components of each binary system might be a born - again star .",
    "for suwt  2 , this interpretation seems extremely unlikely given that the stellar parameters derived by @xcite are not consistent with this evolution .",
    "similarly for m3 - 2 , a faint blue star , which is most likely the true central star , can be seen in deep imagery with good seeing ( boffin  2016 ) .    while not an a - type binary , it is worth to mention that @xcite recently showed that the bright a - type star , believed to form one half of a binary system , at the heart of ngc  1514 is , in fact , unrelated to the nebula and just another chance alignment . as such , chance alignments with field stars",
    "may not be as uncommon as predicted .",
    "the connection between binary central stars and pn shaping is now beyond doubt ( hillwig  2016 ) . given that other authors ( e.g.  nordhaus 2016 ) will summarise the importance ( and current state of our understanding ) of post - common - envelope central stars as part of these proceedings , i will attempt to cover the longer - period systems , summarising our current knowledge of long- and intermediate - period binary central stars .    with more than 50 known binary central stars ( see figure [ fig : periods ] ) only a handful are known with periods greater than a few days .",
    "i will categorise these systems by the technique used in their discovery , and try to explain the inherent difficulties ( and positive points ) for each technique showing the difficulty faced in unveiling the hidden ( but clearly very important ) population of wide binaries in pne .",
    "while the amplitude of photometric variability , due to irradiation or ellipsoidal modulation , falls off rapidly with longer periods , radial velocity variables ( at favourable inclinations ) remain detectable with modest resolution spectrographs out to periods of several days ( up to several hundred days for high resolution spectrographs ) .",
    "however , this technique does have severe limitations in that it is intrinsically limited to brighter central stars ( as high signal - to - noise is essential ) and extremely costly in terms of observing time ( as several different processes can contribute to radial velocity variability , it is essential to observe exhaustively in order to establish the periodic component associated with orbital motion from other sources of variability , for example , wind variability , de marco  2004 ) .",
    "recently , radial velocity monitoring has been used to great effect by @xcite in discovering the wide binaries at the heart of bd+33@xmath62642 and lotr  5 ( which , coincidentally , was previously believed to be a triple system , a hypothesis not consistent with the observations of van winckel ) and by @xcite in the discovery of the 4 day period , post - common - envelope , wolf - rayet binary in ngc5189 .",
    "several systems are known where the star at the apparent centre of the nebula can not have produced the nebula but , as previously shown , this can not be taken as evidence that the observed star forms part of a binary ( or higher - order multiple ) with the nebula progenitor ( mndez  2015 ) .",
    "there are cases , however , where the star at the apparent nebular centre shows evidence of chemical pollution with agb or post - agb material ( s - process elements , for example ) , this can be considered a strong indication that the star is associated with the nebula and that its progenitor was the source of chemical pollution ( miszalski  2013 ) . in these cases , while the radius of the polluted star and the level of pollution can place limits on possible periods , further radial velocity study is essential to constrain precisely the true period of the binary ( e.g.  lotr  5 was known to host a g - type giant star before it s orbital period was found by van winckel  2014 ) .",
    "as the periods here are usually @xmath5100 days , period determination therefore requires long - term monitoring with intermediate- to high - resolution spectrographs , which is often particularly difficult given the competitive nature of telescope time allocations .",
    "the search for infrared excesses ( barker 2016 ) , where the sed of the hot primary shows an additional component ( often peaking in the red or infrared ) due to a cooler companion , is perhaps the most promising methodology for revealing binary central stars as the technique does not depend on periodicity or inclination .",
    "similarly , it is sensitive to a wide range of secondary masses ( much more so that any radial velocity monitoring or photometric variability monitoring ) .",
    "however , the technique is fraught with difficulty , requiring extremely high precision photometry in multiple bands often where the nebular contamination is appreciable and variable with wavelength , and unfortunately offers no clue as to the possible period of the binary ( and , as such , central stars displaying ir excesses might be most appropriately used as a pre - selector for follow - up with other photometric or spectroscopic techniques , aller 2016 ) .",
    "interestingly , the results from surveys for ir excess ( de marco  2013 , douchin  2015 ) indicate an extremely significant total ( both close and wide ) binary fraction further reinforcing that a binary pathway is responsibe for a great number of pne , perhaps even crucial in a majority of cases .",
    "finally , it is important to mention that mergers with stellar or sub - stellar companions may also play an important role in the formation of aspherical planetary nebula ( nordhaus & blackman 2006 ) .",
    "perhaps the main reason that mergers are so frequently over - looked is the extreme difficulty in their detection .",
    "however , with the advent of _ kepler _ and world - wide photometric campaigns ( e.g.  the whole earth telescope ) , the detection of merger products is now within reach , with the first such object being reported by @xcite and @xcite in ngc  6826 . with another @xmath5200 pne to be observed by _",
    "kepler _ as part of campaign 11 ( jacoby  2016 ) and several ground - based photometric campaigns underway ( sowicka  in preparation ) , we may soon be in a position to observationally constrain the importance of a merger pathway for pn formation ."
