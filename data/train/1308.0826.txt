    "<S> we can experimentally justify this suggestion further , as we characterize the feature to be a 2d surface state by changing the photon energy to h@xmath0 = 16.86ev ( fig.3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> a surface state should be unaffected by this change as it shows no dispersion perpendicular to the surface . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> as we quantify by an overlay of the fitted momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) peak positions ( fig.3e ) , the state is essentially unaltered by this change .    </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that te acts as a surfactant during the growth of  films , similar to findings in ge epitaxy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the benefit of te for the surface quality is further underpinned by the fact that we where not able to observe the tss in samples without any te added as in fig.3 a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that a minor surface quality smears out the tss in our photoemission experiment similar to observations in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we find that te acts as an electron - donor which we demonstrate by dispersions measured on three samples with different te concentrations ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> we attribute the slight p - doping at low te concentrations to a diffusion of in atoms from the substrate into the sample .    in conclusion , we have established the 3d topological insulator phase in strained  by means of spin- and angle - resolved photoemission accompanied by _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations . </S>",
