    "the problem of understanding the origin of the large scale galactic magnetic fields has been with us for over forty years .",
    "there have been many papers and reviews on the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields ( see moffatt 1978 ; parker 1979 ; krause and radler 1980 ; ruzmaikin et al . 1988 ; wielebinski & krause 1993 ; beck et al . 1996",
    "; zweibel & heiles 1997 ; kulsrud 1999 ) , and observational reviews ( see miley 1980 ; bridle & perley 1984 ; krnberg 1994 ) , including the observations themselves ( e.g. perley et al . 1984",
    "; taylor et al . 1990 ; taylor & perley 1993 ; eilek et al . 1984 ) .",
    "recent rapid progress in observational work on galaxy clusters has revealed a surprising result .",
    "intracluster medium ( icm ) appears to be definitely magnetized , and in many cases , perhaps are highly magnetized as convincingly argued by eilek et al .",
    "figure 1 presents one such example in hydra a cluster as shown by the rotation measure ( @xmath6 ) map made by taylor & perley ( 1993 ) .",
    "we will show in this article that the implied magnetic energy and flux estimated from extensive @xmath6 maps of a dozen or so galaxy clusters are so exceedingly large that the conventional galactic dynamo models may prove to be inadequate .",
    "we argue that a new source of energy and a different form of the galactic dynamo are required .",
    "as the rotation measure observations of galaxy clusters are relatively new and some of them are ( yet ) unpublished by the observation teams , we will first explain some of the observation results in detail , then discuss their physical implications at length .",
    "in the second half of the article , we will propose a new paradigm related to agn accretion disks and describe some of our recent efforts in understanding a sequence of physical processes revolving around the origin of cluster magnetic fields .",
    "faraday rotation measures , @xmath6 , are shown to be consistent with six other physical interpretations of magnetic fields in ours and nearby galaxies ( star light polarization , interstellar zeeman splitting , synchrotron emission , synchrotron polarization , and inferred by x - ray emission and cosmic ray isotropy and pressure ) ( see krnberg 1994 for a review ) , thus establishing @xmath7 as a reliable measure of galactic and extra galactic magnetic fields .",
    "because of the existence of many self - illuminating as well as background sources , usually agn , and the increasing sensitivity of radio detection , @xmath7 has become the recognized measure of extragalactic magnetic fields ( krnberg 1994 ; taylor et al .",
    "1994 ; ge & owen 1994 ; krause & beck 1998 ) .      recently , high quality @xmath7 maps of self - illuminating sources of galaxy clusters where the distances are known have become available ( for example , taylor & perley 1993 ; eilek et al .",
    "an important quantity that has received less discussion in these papers is _ the magnitude of the magnetic flux and energy_.    figure 1 shows the @xmath6 map of the region illuminated by hydra a in the cluster ( courtesy of taylor & perley 1993 ) .",
    "the largest single region of highest field in this map has approximately the following properties : the size @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 g , derived on the basis that the field is patchy and is tangled on a 4 kpc scale .",
    "this leads to a startling estimates of flux , @xmath10 g @xmath11 , and energy , @xmath12 ergs , assuming that the tangled field is only confined to the 50 kpc region . if this is extended to the whole cluster which is @xmath13 kpc , then the implied flux and energy are correspondingly larger by a factor of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached when a larger sample of @xmath6 of galaxy clusters are analyzed using the data presented in eilek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in table 1",
    ", we have reproduced part of table given in eilek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and added two columns where the approximate flux and energy are calculated assuming that the fields are partially tangled or in loops .",
    "@xmath16 & @xmath17 + & ( kpc ) & ( @xmath18 g ) & ( @xmath19 ergs ) & ( @xmath20 g @xmath2 ) + a 400 & 100 & 2.9 & 3 & 5 + a 1795 & 7 & 18 & 0.03 & 0.17 + a 2052 & 8 & 17 & 0.05 & 0.17 + a 2029 & 10 & 1 & 0.0003 & 0.02 + a 2199 & 30 & 15 & 2 & 0.3 + a 2634 & 140 & 1.9 & 30 & 7 + a 4059 & 10 & 69 & 0.15 & 1 + cyg a & 70 & 15 & 25 & 1.5 + hydra a & 50 & 33 & 40 & 15 + virgo a & 3 & 35 & 0.01 & 0.05 +    furthermore , the estimated values of fluxes and energies are most likely to be the minimum of the actual magnetic fields existing in the galaxy clusters .",
    "faraday rotation depends upon the component of the field strength along the line of sight , @xmath21 , the distance along the line of sight , @xmath22 , and electron density , @xmath23 .",
    "estimates of @xmath23 can be made from the x - ray emission measurements of the clusters with a typical accuracy of @xmath24 , and it varies by factors of 2 to 4 over the region of the source , but otherwise is nearly uniform , and clumping is small ( taylor et al . 1994 ) . if the field is folded in any fashion so that regions of oppositely directed field are in the line of sight , then the observed @xmath7 will be smaller than that if the same field lines were straightened out into one direction . in other words @xmath7 is a minimum measure of @xmath21 .    to put the above numbers in perspective , for a typical galaxy like ours , e.g. , with 1 kpc thickness , 3 kpc homberg radius , and a field of @xmath25 g ,",
    "the magnetic flux and energy are roughly @xmath26 g @xmath2 and @xmath27 ergs , respectively .",
    "one observes that the flux and energy given in table 1 range from close to the hydra a limit to no more than @xmath28 times that of a typical galaxy .",
    "the magnitude of the implied fluxes and energies are so large , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , compared to these quantities within standard galaxies that their origin requires a new source of energy and a different form of the dynamo than previous galactic models .",
    "these minimum energies are sometimes even larger than the baryonic binding energy of galaxies ( @xmath31 ergs ) .",
    "the extremely large fluxes also seem out of reach via amplification by ordinary galaxy rotations in a hubble time .",
    "next , we discuss the difficulty with using turbulence to create these nearly uniform , highly correlated and coherent regions of @xmath7 as seen in figure 1 .",
    "we then discuss the still greater difficulty of creating the total magnetic energy of the cluster based upon a turbulence dynamo model .",
    "it has been suggested by a number of people ( eilek 1999 ; deyoung 1980 ; ruzmaikin et al .",
    "1989 ; goldman & rephaeli 1991 ; jaffe 1980 ) that the entire cluster is uniformly turbulent due to rayleigh taylor instabilities during matter in - fall into the cluster , and that this turbulence drives the cluster dynamo creating the fields .",
    "the problem with this interpretation is the total magnetic energy , the magnitude of the turbulence , the strength of the fields , the apparent correlation of @xmath7 maps with single agn structures , and finally the limited number of rotations of the cluster in a hubble age .    because of the small rotation rate of the typical cluster , @xmath32 km @xmath33 , the available rotation energy is small , @xmath34 of the cluster binding energy , which has a thermal velocity of @xmath35 km @xmath33 .",
    "so applying the turbulent model to hydra a implies a magnetic energy @xmath15 greater than the rotational energy .",
    "therefore the dynamo must be of the @xmath36 type where fields are generated on the small scale , yet as taylor et al .",
    "( 1994 ) point out , the fields of hydra a and a1795 reverse on the different sides of the core , requiring coherence on scales of 100 kpc . since this reversal is correlated with the structure of the source , and since the energy generated at the small scale",
    "is small compared to the turbulence input and the turbulent input should be small compared to the binding energy ( deyoung 1992 ) , we believe that all these factors point to random , localized sources of magnetic energy of size @xmath37 ergs .",
    "this is probably too demanding for turbulence .",
    "furthermore , it will be difficult to produce large scale coherent @xmath6 regions , which have been observed in hydra a ( figure 1 , northern region ) and several other galaxy clusters ( eilek et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is because in a turbulent plasma , the emission , the @xmath7 , and the degree of polarization should all be statistically symmetric . despite the unlikelyhood of all these factors conspiring to create both a pattern and a nearly uniform @xmath7",
    ", one observes in many @xmath7 maps of agn , mostly in clusters , a distinct match in the @xmath7 pattern with the jet like pattern of emission .",
    "particularly the sign of the average @xmath7 in several cases reverses across a symmetry plane through he core of the agn ( taylor & perley 1993 ) .",
    "the size of the regions of uniform @xmath7 correlates strikingly with the size of the jet as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "we interpret this correlation as due to the source of the field being the agn jet as opposed to a turbulent @xmath5 dynamo in the cluster as a whole .",
    "using serendipitous polarized background sources , therefore random lines of sight through random clusters , clark & krnberg s ( 1999 ) have made @xmath38 @xmath7 measurements .",
    "their observations have produced a boundary of the typical cluster in @xmath7 such that the average field was @xmath25 g out to a radius of @xmath39 kpc .",
    "the magnetic flux and energy , @xmath40 g @xmath11 and @xmath41 ergs , are then similar to the largest structure already discussed in hydra a. if each galaxy of a typical cluster with @xmath42 large galaxies contributes a high field region during its agn phase , then the probability of intersecting such a region of area that is @xmath43 of the cluster is roughly @xmath44 so that in 100 lines of sight , the probability of intersecting a hydra - like region of an agn in a cluster is @xmath45 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the variability they observed .",
    "finally we note that the large degree of polarization observed @xmath46 in these sources indicates that the rotation source and emission source can not be in the same location ( burn 1966 ; taylor 1991 ) , otherwise polarized emission from various depths in the source would undergo different degrees of rotation and hence emerge depolarized .",
    "therefore in any model the faraday screen and the emission source must be related and even congruent in order that the screen and hence @xmath7 be correlated with the core of the agn .",
    "purely based on the energetics , the accretion disk around supermassive black holes in agns offers an attractive site for the production of magnetic fields .",
    "the accessible binding energy of the black hole is @xmath47 ergs and the winding number of the disk forming the bh of nearly every galaxy is @xmath48 at @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bh horizon ( @xmath51au ) . using the canonical numbers thought to apply to agn disks , the bh dynamo flux can be @xmath52 g @xmath2 , where we have used @xmath53 g at @xmath54 ergs @xmath33 and @xmath55 cm .",
    "both the flux and energy from this simple analysis are @xmath56 times the maximum observed values .",
    "no other source of energy is likely to be sufficient by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore it is much more reasonable to assume that every agn , both within and external to clusters , produces the magnetic energy and flux that we observe in this extreme case from the binding energy released in the accretion disk forming the central bh .",
    "this implies that every galaxy contains a bh where @xmath57 of the accessible binding energy is transformed into magnetic energy during its agn phase by an accretion disk dynamo . on the average",
    "this flux and energy is distributed throughout the universe as force - free fields and only a small fraction @xmath58 of the magnetic energy is dissipated in the form of the agn spectra , thus explaining the problem of the missing agn luminosity ( richstone 1998 ; krolik 1999 ) . in this picture a larger fraction of the magnetic energy is dissipated where the brightest agns are seen in galaxy clusters , because only in the clusters is a sufficient gas density retained by the gravity of the cluster such that this density confines the field increasing the fraction of the magnetic energy that is dissipated . for most galaxies external to dense clusters a small fraction of this magnetic energy",
    "is dissipated as the agn radiation , a small fraction remains in the galaxy , and the bulk of the magnetic energy and flux is distributed in the walls and voids of the universe .",
    "the sequence of phenomena that can explain this astonishing extragalactic magnetic flux and energy must start with an accretion disk forming a massive central galactic bh .",
    "this in turn presumes an answer to an equally enigmatic question , namely the formation of these massive galactic bhs themselves ( begelman et al . 1989 ; rees 1999 ) . by focusing on the transport of angular momentum",
    "we believe that the flat rotation curve mass distribution can be explained as a plausible result of any non - linear collapse of an initial gaseous baryonic density fluctuation by hierarchical tidal torquing ( newman & wasserman 1999 ) . the bh forms from this mass distribution when the rossby vortex torque mechanism supersedes tidal torquing and an accretion disk forms .",
    "all this mass then collapses to a bh .",
    "the flat rotation curve , @xmath59 , results in @xmath60 .",
    "when this thickness reaches @xmath61 to @xmath62 g @xmath63 , heat is confined for several revolutions , and the rossby vortex instability initiates at @xmath64 to @xmath65 . finally the dynamo produced fields then supersede the previous torque mechanisms .      we have predicted and demonstrated analytically and numerically how a new instability in keplerian flow , the rossby vortex instability , can grow ( lovelace et al .",
    "1999 ; li et al . 2000a ; li et al .",
    "the production of vortices is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this instability produces torque and thus transports angular momentum within an accretion disk by purely hydrodynamically means via the interaction of large , two - dimensional , co - rotating rossby vortices .",
    "the enhanced transport of angular momentum by co - rotating vortices is recognized in rotational atmospheric flows ( staley & gall 1979 ) and in laboratory measurements of the ranque - hilsch tube ( hilsch 1946 ; frhlingsdorf & unger 1999 , colgate & buchler 1999 ) .",
    "a coherent dynamo can form in a keplerian accretion disk because of the large azimuthal velocity shear , provided that there exists a robust source of non - axisymmetric helicity .",
    "classically turbulence has been invoked to explain this helicity using the mean field dynamo theory , but we know of no way to create this degree of turbulence , with vertical motions , hydrodynamically in an accretion disk , because hydrodynamic turbulence alone is damped in an accretion disk ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "the magnetic instability of balbus & hawley will lead to turbulence , but the magnitude of the turbulence is orders of magnitude too small compared to the keplerian stress .",
    "instead we have identified a new , robust source of helicity driven by star - disk collisions by a small mass fraction @xmath66 of pre galaxy - formation stars .",
    "the keplerian shear and a star - disk collision with the twist producing helicity is shown in fig .",
    "we have demonstrated by laboratory flow visualization experiments of how plumes , driven in a rotating frame , counter rotate relative to the frame ( beckley & colgate 1998 ; beckley et al . 2000 ) and thus produce a robust and coherent helicity where flux is always added in the same direction and where the driving force is large compared to the keplerian stress in the disk .",
    "we have simulated the positive , exponential gain of both the quadrupole and dipole poloidal field of such a dynamo with a vector potential code in 3-d , cylindrical coordinates , where the velocity field simulates both the keplerian rotation and star collision - produced plumes .",
    "we have observed a growth rate of @xmath67 per revolution , two plumes per two revolutions , @xmath68 , and with a magnetic reynolds number , @xmath69 ( pariev , colgate & finn 2000 ) .      with positive gain and large winding number , the dynamo will saturate regardless of how small the seed field is . since the helicity does not depend on turbulence",
    ", it will not be subject to turbulent @xmath70-quenching at the small scale ( vainstein & cattanio 1992 ; vainshtein & rosner 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore since the stars maintain virial velocity , their velocity is supersonic relative to the disk and the resulting shock stress is large . at the back reaction limit",
    ", the field grows until the torque of the field affects the keplerian motion , and the accessible bh binding energy is converted into magnetic energy .",
    "the progressive loss of this flux is a force - free helical , poynting magnetic flux , which we identify as the collimated agn jets .",
    "we have investigated the field topology of these twisted helical flux surfaces by integrating the grad - shafranov equations for a force - free axisymmetric field with a keplerian distribution of winding number ( li et al .",
    "2000c ) as shown in fig .",
    "since the field decreases as @xmath71 , the pressure , at large radius as the helix extends to mpcs , becomes of the order of the igm and and the outer boundary of the helix is self collimating ( lynden - bell 1996 ) .",
    "the energy carried by this helix , at a mean radius near the bh , @xmath72 is the accessible energy of accretion or @xmath73 or @xmath74 g , @xmath75 amperes , and @xmath76 volts and @xmath77 watts @xmath78 ergs @xmath33 .",
    "general relativity inside the innermost stable orbit will add additional energy ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; livio et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the distribution of this flux in the universe occurs by partial tearing mode reconnection producing the minimum energy taylor state ( taylor 1986 ) .",
    "the total flux is conserved , but a fraction of the energy is dissipated in the tearing mode , @xmath79 reconnection .",
    "the resulting @xmath80 acceleration of the current carriers produces the emission that we associate with the agn .",
