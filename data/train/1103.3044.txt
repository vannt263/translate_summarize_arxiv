    "before we present our results , it is important to emphasize that there are two different contributions to the nernst effect in a superconductor : 1 ) a positive contribution from superconductivity ( moving vortices and fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter ) ; 2 ) a contribution from normal - state quasi - particles , which can be either positive or negative . in ybco",
    ", the two contributions can be readily separated because the quasi - particle contribution is negative , of opposite sign to the signal from superconducting fluctuations.@xcite note also that the quasi - particle contribution to the nernst coefficient @xmath55 is mostly independent of field , whereas the superconducting contribution is strongly dependent on field.@xcite in the electron - doped cuprate pr@xmath56ce@xmath13cuo@xmath15 , for example , this difference in the field dependence was used to separate the two contributions , both positive in this case.@xcite    the amplitude of the quasi - particle contribution may be estimated from the following expression:@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath59 is the electron charge , @xmath60 is the carrier mobility and @xmath61 the fermi temperature .",

    "the positive ( field - decreasing ) superconducting contribution has become vanishingly small .",
    "this shows that in a clean underdoped cuprate the regime of significant superconducting fluctuations does not extend in temperature very far beyond @xmath24 .",
    "more quantitatively , the superconducting contribution to the nernst coefficient @xmath17 in ybco drops to 0.1% of its peak value at @xmath24 by @xmath71 .    in fig .  3",
    ", we see that the normal - state @xmath17 at 28 t is independent of temperature below @xmath72  k. its large negative value at @xmath5 is completely and unambiguously due to quasi - particles . in fig .  4",
    ", we compare the normal - state @xmath33 and @xmath35 as a function of temperature .",
    "we see that the large anisotropy characteristic of the pseudogap phase disappears below @xmath72  k.    the in - plane anisotropy of the normal - state @xmath25 is plotted in fig .  5 , as the difference @xmath73 ( top panel ) and the normalized difference @xmath74 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the nernst anisotropy is seen to rise just below the pseudogap temperature @xmath3 , defined as the temperature below which the @xmath20-axis resistivity drops below its linear dependence at high temperature.@xcite upon cooling , it continues to rise , until it reaches a maximal value of @xmath75 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath76 ) at @xmath46  k. upon further cooling , however , we now find that the anisotropy drops rapidly , with @xmath77 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath78 ) as @xmath5 .",
    "to elucidate the cause of this dramatic drop in the nernst anisotropy , we turn to the hall coefficient @xmath8 . in fig .  5 , the normal - state hall angle @xmath79 is plotted as @xmath80 , the ratio of hall to longitudinal resistivities . upon cooling",
    ", we see that the drop in @xmath81 to negative values tracks precisely the drop in nernst anisotropy .",
    "( note that from the onsager relation , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is independent of current direction in the basal plane.@xcite )        soon after the discovery of quantum oscillations in ybco,@xcite the fact that the oscillations were seen on top of a large background of negative hall resistance led to the interpretation that the oscillations come from orbits around an electron - like fermi pocket.@xcite this interpretation was later confirmed by the observation of a large negative seebeck coefficient at low temperature.@xcite clinching evidence came recently from the quantitative agreement between the measured ( negative ) value of @xmath84 at @xmath5 , on the one hand , and the magnitude of @xmath84 expected from the fermi energy inscribed in the quantum oscillations , on the other hand , both obtained in ybco at the same doping , namely @xmath85.@xcite therefore , in the doping interval from @xmath9 to at least @xmath10,@xcite the fermi surface of ybco in its non - superconducting ground state contains a small closed electron pocket .",
    "this pocket dominates the transport properties at low temperature , as discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "in particular , it produces a large ( quasiparticle ) nernst signal . applying eq .  1 to ybco at @xmath85 , where quantum oscillations give @xmath86  k and @xmath87  t@xmath88,@xcite yields @xmath89  nv / k@xmath90 t , while the measured value at @xmath85 is @xmath91  nv / k@xmath90t,@xcite in perfect agreement . the somewhat smaller value at @xmath16 , namely @xmath92  nv / k@xmath90 t as @xmath5 ( fig .  4 ) ,",
    "is probably due to the lower mobility expected of samples in the ortho - viii phase ( with @xmath93 ) compared to those in the ortho - ii phase ( with @xmath94 ) , consistent with the much weaker quantum oscillations in the former .",
    "the fact that @xmath95 as @xmath5 shows that the electron pocket yields transport properties that are isotropic in the plane .",
    "this explains two features of the transport in ybco .",
    "the first is the jump in the in - plane anisotropy of the resistivity as the doping drops below @xmath96.@xcite indeed , it was recently discovered that the electron pocket disappears suddenly as the doping is reduced below a critical value @xmath26,@xcite in the sense that for @xmath97 both hall@xcite and seebeck@xcite coefficients depend weakly on temperature and remain positive at @xmath5 .",
    "this change in fermi - surface topology ( or lifshitz transition ) coincides with a ten - fold increase in resistivity at @xmath5,@xcite showing that the high - conductivity part of the fermi surface has disappeared . once the high - mobility electron pocket is removed ,",
    "the in - plane anisotropy ratio @xmath98 rises ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the second feature is the rapid loss of in - plane anisotropy in the nernst coefficient upon cooling . as shown in fig .  5 , the precipitous drop in the anisotropy ratio @xmath74 below 80  k tracks closely the fall in the hall signal ( plotted as @xmath99 ) towards large negative values .",
    "as the electron pocket becomes increasingly dominant upon cooling , _ i.e. _ as its mobility @xmath100 increases , the nernst signal becomes increasingly isotropic .",
    "the natural explanation for the emergence of an electron pocket in a hole - doped cuprate is the onset of a new periodicity that breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice and thus reduces the brillouin zone , causing a reconstruction of the large hole fermi surface into smaller pieces.@xcite a recent study that compares ybco to the hole - doped cuprate eu - lsco found that the seebeck coefficient behaves in essentially identical fashion in the two materials , as a function of both temperature and doping:@xcite @xmath84 drops to negative values ( of very similar magnitude ) below the same peak temperature , the sign - change temperature @xmath101 is maximal at @xmath102 in both cases , the drop in @xmath84 disappears below the same critical doping @xmath26 .",
    "so the same fermi - surface reconstruction must be taking place in eu - lsco as in ybco , pointing to a generic mechanism of hole - doped cuprates .",
    "now in eu - lsco , charge modulations are observed by x - ray diffraction at low temperature,@xcite over the entire doping range where @xmath103.@xcite spin modulations are most likely also present , as observed in the closely related material la@xmath104sr@xmath13nd@xmath105cuo@xmath15 ( nd - lsco).@xcite called ` stripe order ' , these spin and charge modulations break the translational symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 planes , and so will cause a reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "calculations for stripe order at @xmath102 show that an electron pocket will generically appear,@xcite causing the quasiparticle nernst signal to be strongly enhanced.@xcite it is then reasonable to infer that stripe order causes the fermi - surface reconstruction in these underdoped cuprates .",
    "because stripe order involves unidirectional spin and/or charge modulations , it also breaks the four - fold rotational symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 planes.@xcite so the reconstructed fermi surface is expected to have strong in - plane anisotropy , manifest in the calculations by the presence of quasi-1d open sheets.@xcite however , if the conductivity of the relatively isotropic electron pockets is much higher , at low temperature , than that of these open sheets , the inherent anisotropy of the latter will only show up in transport when the electron pocket disappears , as it does below @xmath96 .",
    "we have focused so far on the non - superconducting ground state at @xmath5 , with its stripe order and reconstructed fermi surface .",
    "let us now ask what happens when the temperature is raised .    the presence of the electron pocket persists at least as long as the hall coefficient is negative . in ybco at @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath8 changes from negative to positive at the sign - change temperature @xmath106  k , above @xmath107  k.@xcite of course , the drop in @xmath8 starts at higher temperature , namely at the peak in @xmath8 near 90  k ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "in fact , the onset of the downturn is really at the temperature @xmath7 where the curvature changes from upward at high temperature to downward at low temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ at the inflexion point . at @xmath31 , @xmath108",
    "k ( see fig .  5 ) . in fig .  1 , this temperature @xmath7 is plotted vs @xmath109 on the phase diagram of ybco .",
    "we see that it lies inside the pseudogap phase , between the crossover temperature @xmath3 and the zero - field superconducting temperature @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the electron pocket starts emerging at temperatures well above the onset of superconductivity , and it does so even in small magnetic fields . in this sense ,",
    "the onset of fermi - surface reconstruction is not field - induced ; it is a property of the zero - field pseudogap phase .",
    "if @xmath7 marks the onset of fermi - surface reconstruction in ybco as detected in the hall effect , what corresponding characteristic temperature do we obtain from other transport properties ? from the seebeck coefficient @xmath84 vs @xmath28 ,",
    "a similar characteristic temperature is obtained , with @xmath110  k at @xmath31.@xcite however , the nernst coefficient , plotted as @xmath17 vs @xmath28 , starts its drop to large negative values at a temperature @xmath111 which is significantly higher , namely @xmath112  k at @xmath16.@xcite ( @xmath111 is independent of direction , the same whether it is measured in @xmath33 or @xmath35.@xcite ) calculations show that the quasiparticle nernst effect is an extremely sensitive probe of fermi - surface distortions such as would arise from broken rotational symmetry.@xcite the value of @xmath111 is plotted as a function of doping in the phase diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "we see that @xmath113 .",
    "now @xmath111 coincides with the temperature @xmath114 below which the in - plane ( @xmath20-axis ) resistivity @xmath115 of ybco deviates from its linear temperature dependence at high temperature .",
    "this @xmath114 is regarded as the standard definition of the pseudogap crossover temperature @xmath3.@xcite the fact that @xmath116 at all dopings shows that the drop in @xmath17 to negative values is a property of the pseudogap phase .",
    "given that the large value of @xmath17 at @xmath5 is firmly associated with the small high - mobility electron pocket in ybco , can @xmath111 therefore be regarded as the onset of fermi - surface reconstruction as detected in the nernst effect ? by the same token , can @xmath114 be regarded as the onset of incipient fermi - surface reconstruction detected in the resisitivity ?",
    "if so , then the pseudogap phase would be the high - temperature precursor of the stripe - ordered phase present at low temperature .",
    "one evidence in support of a stripe - precursor scenario is the fact that the enhancement of the nernst coefficient @xmath17 below @xmath3 is anisotropic , that it breaks the rotational symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "this , of course , is a characteristic signature of stripe ordering .",
    "indeed , the sequence of broken symmetries , first rotational then translational , is expected in the gradual process of stripe ordering.@xcite the sequence is called ` nematic to smectic ' ordering .",
    "the fact that @xmath111 and @xmath114 are higher than @xmath117 and @xmath7 , by roughly a factor 2 , may come from the role of scattering in the various transport coefficients .",
    "indeed , while @xmath22 and @xmath118 both depend directly on the scattering rate ( or mobility @xmath60 ) , with @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath83 do not ( at least in a single band model ) . in other words",
    ", if stripe fluctuations affect the transport primarily through the scattering rate , then we would expect @xmath118 and @xmath22 to be sensitive to the onset of stripe fluctuations , but not @xmath121 and @xmath83 .",
    "as we shall now see , similar precursor effects are observed in the iron - pnictide superconductors .",
    "it is instructive to compare the cuprate superconductor ybco with the iron - pnictide superconductor ba(fe@xmath122co@xmath13)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( co - ba122 ) . in the parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "a well - defined antiferromagnetic order sets in below a critical temperature @xmath123  k.@xcite this order is unidirectional , with chains of ferromagnetically aligned spins along the @xmath21-axis of the orthorhombic crystal structure alternating antiferromagnetically in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath20-axis ) . in other words , this is a form of ` spin - stripe ' order , which breaks both the translational and rotational symmetry of the original tetragonal lattice ( present well above @xmath124 ) .",
    "as co is introduced , @xmath124 falls , and superconductivity appears , with @xmath24 peaking at the point where it crosses @xmath124 . in other words , in the underdoped region the normal state is characterized by spin - stripe order for some range of temperature above @xmath24 .",
    "this order causes a reconstruction of the fermi surface , which leads to a change in the in - plane resistivity : a drop below @xmath124 at low co concentration @xmath125 , an upturn at intermediate @xmath125 .",
    "however , the upturn starts well above @xmath124 .",
    "one can define a temperature @xmath126 below which the roughly linear @xmath28 dependence at high temperature turns upwards . for @xmath127 , @xmath128  @xmath124.@xcite moreover ,",
    "the rise in @xmath118 is anisotropic : a strong in - plane anisotropy appears at @xmath126.@xcite at higher doping , above the quantum critical point where antiferromagnetic order disappears ( in the absence of superconductivity ) , both the upturn and the anisotropy in @xmath118 vanish.@xcite    the overall phenomenology is seen to be remarkably similar to that of ybco .",
    "the unidirectional order that breaks translational symmetry and reconstructs the fermi surface at low temperature is preceded at high temperature by a regime with strong in - plane transport anisotropy , evidence of broken rotational symmetry . in co - ba122 , it is very natural to view this regime as the nematic precursor to the smectic phase at low temperature .",
    "the analogy supports the view that the pseudogap phase in ybco is just such a precursor to stripe order .",
    "it is interesting to note that in co - ba122 the in - plane anisotropy in @xmath118 is not largest at @xmath129 , where the order is strongest ( @xmath124 is highest ) .",
    "indeed , the ratio @xmath130 at @xmath5 is larger at @xmath131 than at @xmath129.@xcite this could well be due to a short - circuiting effect similar to that observed in ybco , whereby a small and isotropic fermi pocket of high mobility dominates the conductivity .",
    "indeed , the concentration @xmath132 in co - ba122 appears to be a lifshitz critical point , as suggested by arpes experiments that reveal the existence of a small hole pocket for @xmath133 , and not above.@xcite such a pocket could short - circuit the in - plane anisotropy coming from other parts of the fermi surface .",
    "in summary , the nernst effect is a highly sensitive probe of electronic transformations in metals . in the cuprate superconductor ybco",
    ", the onset of the pseudogap phase at @xmath3 causes a 100-fold enhancement of the quasiparticle nernst coefficient , which goes smoothly from @xmath134  nv / k@xmath90 t at @xmath3 to @xmath135  nv / k@xmath90 t at @xmath5 , in the normal ( non - superconducting ) state .",
    "this enhancement is strongly anisotropic in the plane , showing that the pseudogap phase breaks the rotational symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "when the fermi - surface reconstructs at low temperature , the formation of a high - mobility electron pocket short - circuits this in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath17 at @xmath5 is in perfect agreement with the value expected from the small closed fermi pocket detected in quantum oscillations .",

    "the analogy suggests that the enigmatic pseudogap phase of hole - doped cuprates is also a high - temperature precursor of a stripe - ordered phase , with unidirectional charge and/or spin modulations .",
