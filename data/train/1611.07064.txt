    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are binary systems containing a non - magnetic ( @xmath3 g ) white dwarf actively accreting from a roche lobe - filling main - sequence companion via an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "all known dne undergo episodic outbursts , which last between a few days and a few years , recur between 10 days and several decades , and result in brightening by 28 magnitudes in the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dn outbursts seem to be analogous to x - ray binary ( xrb ) outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the similarities between their hardness - intensity diagrams ( disk - fraction luminosity diagram , or dfld , in the case of dne ) together with the presence of transient radio emission suggests that the connection between the outburst phase and the radio ( jet ) emission could be similar as well @xcite .    while some classes of accreting white dwarf systems , such as symbiotic stars , and magnetic cataclysmic variables , were detected in the radio , dne were , until recently , thought to be weak radio emitters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "even for the few dne that were detected in the radio during outbursts , the detection was not reproducible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that many of the non - magnetic accreting white dwarf systems are faint ( @xmath40.1 mjy ) and variable on @xmath2hours timescales in the radio , and that the sensitivities , time - resolutions or timing of previous observations were insufficient to detect these fainter systems .",
    "dne have now been shown to be repeating radio emitters during outbursts @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature from vlbi imaging , the outburst track in the dfld , the radio spectral indices , and the shape of the radio light curves have been used to argue in support of synchrotron emission from a transient jet as the cause of the radio emission during dne outbursts @xcite .",
    "the quintessential dn , ss cyg , is one of the best studied systems of its class across the electromagnetic spectrum .",

    "allows the study of the energetics of this system at a level of precision impossible to achieve for most accreting systems .",
    "long - term optical monitoring of ss cyg has revealed regular outbursts lasting @xmath2520 days and recurring on timescales between @xmath22060 days @xcite . the majority of the outbursts have rise and decay rates ( in the optical ) that are remarkably similar from one outburst to another , and scattered around 0.5 days mag@xmath0 and 2.5 days mag@xmath0 respectively .",
    "about 10% of the outbursts , referred to as `` anomalous '' , exhibit a slow rise of @xmath61.5 days mag@xmath0 in the optical @xcite .",
    "x - ray and ultraviolet observations suggest that accretion in ss cyg ( and similarly in other dwarf novae ) occurs via a `` boundary region '' between the inner accretion disk and the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the boundary region becomes optically thick at x - ray frequencies at the onset of an outburst and may play a role in jet production in ss cyg @xcite .",
    "analogous to xrbs , ss cyg is expected to have a steady jet during the rise phase of an outburst and discrete plasma ejection after the subsequent spectral softening @xcite .    in february 2016 ,",
    "ss cyg underwent an anomalous outburst , which lasted for about 3 weeks ( at v@xmath711 mag ) .",

    "we requested close monitoring of ss cyg and immediate submission of observations to the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ; special notice # 412 , alert notice 536 ) in order to catch the rise phase of the outburst and obtain a well - sampled optical light curve .",
    "good sampling at the beginning of the outburst was necessary for triggering the radio observations ( see below ) .",
    "the data were downloaded from the aavso website .",
    "we used the v band magnitudes for our analysis .",
    "the optical light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : main_lc ] .",
    "we monitored the aavso light curve , and once the optical light curve reached 11.5 mag in the pre - validated v band ( on 2016 feb 11 ) , we triggered the arcminute microkelvin imager large array ( ami - la ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) radio telescope .",
    "observations were made with the new digital correlator having 4096 channels across a 5 ghz bandwidth between 1318 ghz .",
    "ss cyg was monitored for about 10 hours every day throughout the @xmath23 weeks of outburst .",
    "the phase calibrator , j2153 + 4322 , was observed every 12 minutes for about 1.5 minutes .",
    "the log of ami - la observations is given in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the ami - la data were binned to 8@xmath80.625 ghz channels and processed ( rfi excision and calibration ) with a fully - automated pipeline , ami - reduce ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "daily measurements of 3c48 and 3c286 were used for the absolute flux calibration , which is good to about 10% .",
    "the calibrated amplitudes for j2153 + 4322 showed variability of 20% ( peak - to - peak ) around the mean of 250 mjy at 15.5 ghz within each 10-hour observing block .",
    "this variability in the complex gain calibrator is likely a combination of unmodeled gain variations and pointing errors .",
    "hence we recalibrated the data using fixed values for the flux density ( @xmath9 mjy ) and spectral index ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ) of j2153 + 4322 , which are our best estimates based on our knowledge of the instrument and the data .",
    "conservative uncertainties in these estimates are 5% ( flux density ) and 0.1 ( spectral index ) , and hence we conclude that the error in flux density is dominated by the absolute flux scale uncertainty . while there are no published 15 ghz flux density measurements for j2153 + 4322 , the flux density and the spectral index that we have used are consistent with its 8.4 ghz flux densities measured in 2011280 mjy from http://astrogeo.org/v2m/maps/bc196zc/ and @xcite , for example ] .    the calibrated and rfi - flagged data were then imported into casa .",
    "since the ami - la synthesized beam is approximately 30 , the @xmath21 mjy radio source 22.3   to the north - west of ss cyg causes confusion and had to be subtracted from the uv plane .",
    "we used the interactive mode of casa clean to define a restricted clean box at the coordinates of the confusing source ( the clean box does not overlap with the location of ss cyg ) and derived a model for each ami - la observation .",
    "we then loaded and subtracted the model from the casa measurement sets using the tasks ft and uvsub .",
    "we then split each 10-hour observation into shorter intervals as needed , according to the variability seen in the source , and imaged each interval using casa clean .",

    "we detected significant variability on @xmath2hour timescales starting on 14 february .",
    "a comparison with a `` normal '' optical outburst ( grey points in figure  [ fig : main_lc ] ) suggests that the flaring started when the normal optical outburst would have been expected to begin .",
    "further observations are necessary to verify whether this is indeed the case during a normal optical outburst .",
    "the first flare occurred towards the end of our ami - la observation carried out on 14 february ( mjd 57432.6726 ) , at a peak flux density of @xmath22 @xmath20jy at 15.5 ghz .",
    "subsequently , a series of rapid flares , with rise times between 530 minutes were seen throughout the outburst .",
    "while the majority of the radio flares peaked at sub - mjy flux densities , we detected a very luminous flare towards the end of the outburst , peaking at @xmath23 mjy at 15.5 ghz and lasting for only @xmath215 minutes .",
    "the radio light curves at 14.25 ghz and 16.75 ghz for this fast luminous flare ( `` giant '' flare ) are shown in figure  [ fig : bigflare_lc ] .",
    "there is some evidence of radio brightening of ss cyg towards the end of the april 2007 and april 2016 outbursts as well ( krding et al . in prep , miller - jones et al . in prep ) , which may suggest the presence of such a giant flare is a common feature of outbursts in ss cyg . if so , then such a flare could have been missed in the majority of the past radio observations ( those reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to their much sparser time coverage .",
    "overall , during the outburst , the radio emission lasted for 3 weeks ( 11 february to 02 march 2016 , i.e. mjd 5743257449 ; above our 2@xmath21 detection threshold of @xmath240 @xmath20jy ) .",
    "the initial radio flares , seen over a span of @xmath21 week ( between mjd 57432 and 57439 ) , had rise times of tens of minutes and at peak they had an optically thick spectrum at 15.5 ghz .",
    "each successive flare was seen to have a peak flux density higher than the previous one .",
    "if this flaring activity is related to plasma ejection events , then the optically thick spectrum ( with @xmath24 ) suggests that the particle acceleration time is shorter than the expansion timescale of the ejected blobs .",
    "this initial set of flares , which continued into the peak / flattening of the optical light curve , was followed by a few days where the radio emission was fairly steady or rising gradually .",
    "the 15.5 ghz flux density was between 100200 @xmath20jy during this phase .",
    "this steady period may be related to the `` plateau '' phase seen during past radio observations of ss cyg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the coverage of these previous observations was very sparse .",
    "between mjd 57443 and 57446 , the flaring activity resumed and during this period the overall spectrum at the flare peak was optically thinner than the earlier flares .",
    "in general , the flare peaks are short lived and hard to define , but probably represent optically thick to thin transition .",
    "the multiple radio flares seen throughout the outburst are unlikely to be caused by the source crossing the `` jet line '' multiple times , given the evolution in the dfld @xcite , and may be either due to internal shocks , external shocks , or multiple discrete ejections not tied to any specific jet line .    in the first two hours of the ami - la observation on 29 february ( mjd 57447.31 ) , ss cyg was at or below 150 @xmath20jy . on mjd 57447.4",
    "we detected the onset of the giant flare ( figure  [ fig : bigflare_lc ] ) .",
    "after a gradual increase in flux density to 1.5 mjy , the giant flare reached its peak in @xmath25 minutes ( e - folding timescale of @xmath21.5 minutes ) .",
    "the implied variability brightness temperature is @xmath25 k , which is comparable to or even greater than that seen in flares from magnetic cvs .",
    "this value can also be compared with the lower limits to the brightness temperature placed from vlba observations , @xmath26 k , and previously observed radio variability , @xmath27 k @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 of the giant flare and other radio flares detected during the outburst is consistent either with a synchrotron origin of the flares , as noted by previous works @xcite , or with a coherent source of emission .",
    "recently , 100% circularly polarized radio flares were detected in nova - like cataclysmic variables @xcite , indicating coherent emission .",
    "we can neither confirm nor rule out the coherent mechanism hypothesis through our radio observations since the ami - la does not provide any polarization information . the time resolution and sensitivity of the ami - la data",
    "are sufficient to ( temporally ) resolve the giant flare and get reliable spectral indices . during the rise phase of the giant flare , the spectral index ( @xmath29 )",
    "is @xmath30 ( mjd 57447.4042 ; @xmath31 mjy ) , which increases to @xmath32 ( mjd 57447.4047 ; @xmath33 mjy ) , consistent with a fully self - absorbed synchrotron source . beyond this maximum in the spectral index",
    ", the spectrum between 1318 ghz evolves towards becoming optically thin . at the peak of the giant flare ( mjd 57447.4064 , @xmath34 mjy ) ,",
    "the spectral index is @xmath35 , and then decreases to a minimum of @xmath36 ( mjd 57447.4081 ; @xmath37 mjy ) during the decay of the flare . at mjd 57447.4103 ,",
    "another mjy - level flare , optically thin and peaking at @xmath38 mjy at 16.75 ghz , is detected and may have a delayed , less - luminous , counterpart at 14.25 ghz at 57447.4125 ( see figure  [ fig : bigflare_lc ] ) .",
    "overall , the behavior of the radio emission at frequencies between 14.25 ghz and 16.75 ghz is consistent with the adiabatic expansion of a synchrotron - emitting plasma blob @xcite .",
    "the question of why there was a giant radio flare towards the end of the outburst warrants some consideration . according to the disk instability model , the material accreted from the companion star gradually builds up in the accretion disk until the temperature increases to the critical point to drive the hydrogen ionization instability , thereby transporting the accretion disk material rapidly onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "during outburst , the x - ray emission rises at a similar time as the optical , and this is attributed to the material reaching the boundary layer .",
    "the boundary layer becomes optically thick and quenches the x - ray radiation while the extreme uv radiation rises rapidly @xcite .",
    "residual x - ray emission persists through the outburst phase .",
    "our x - ray observation was carried out soon after the optical light curve reached peak ( mjd 57436.14 ) .",
    "the 110 kev luminosity , @xmath39 erg s@xmath0 , is in agreement with past observations during this phase of the outburst . at the end of the optical and ultraviolet decay phases ,",
    "the x - ray emission rises gradually , and later fades back to quiescent levels @xcite . during the phase when the optical and uv emission are declining",
    ", the accretion rate is expected to drop substantially .",
    "hence the `` giant '' flare , seen towards the end of the outburst , is intriguing .",
    "if the giant flare is due to the ejection of plasma blob(s ) , then the large amplitude of the radio flare during this decay phase remains unexplained .",
    "a comparison between our observations and a normal optical outburst suggests that the giant flare occurs either slightly before or right at the start of the x - ray increase at the end of the outburst ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 23 days before the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "this suggests that the giant flare is not driven by the large change in the optical depth of the boundary layer .",
    "although the magnetic field of the white dwarf in ss cyg is not high , it is possible that something like the propeller effect or magnetic reconnection takes over as the accretion rate is falling and generates an outflow of gas ( e.g. in cases of ae aqr and vw hyi ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence a luminous flare in the radio . since the isotropic 15.5 ghz luminosity at the peak of the giant flare ( and @xmath40 ) is @xmath41 erg s@xmath0 , this flare may be consistent with the l@xmath42 to l@xmath43 relationship ( using an estimate of the x - ray luminosity from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seen for black hole systems ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit for a very short period of time .",
    "lastly , we would like to highlight the importance of densely - sampled radio coverage , without which the rapid flares and the giant radio flare ( which had a duration of 15 minutes ) towards the end of ss cyg s outburst would have remained unknown .",
    "the 200 hours of observing presented here may not be feasible with telescopes like the ska or its pathfinders , and this underscores the need for interferometers like the ami - la to be operational in the era of large telescopes .",
    "niche areas of astronomy will continue to be accessible only with such small radio interferometers .",
