    "consider a set of @xmath0 agents which hold continuous opinions . `",
    "continuous ' means that the opinion is in its essence a vector of @xmath1 real numbers .",
    "an example for a continuous opinion is a budget plan proposal , where a fixed amount of money is distributed to @xmath2 departements .",
    "other examples are prices for products or an estimate of an unknown fact , like the number of humans on earth in 2050 .",
    "consider further on that the agents are willing to adjust their opinion towards the opinions of others .",
    "adjustment of a continuous opinion can be well described by computing a weighted arithmetic mean of other agent s opinions .",
    "a process of continuous opinion dynamics can be seen as repeated averaging of opinions .",
    "if the averaging weights are fixed ( as in @xcite ) then the process can be mapped to @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the @xmath5-dimensional vector of opinions and @xmath6 being a row - stochastic matrix which represents the averaging weights for each agent in a row .",
    "the central research question was about conditions for reaching consensus .",
    "krause @xcite invented a nonlinear bounded confidence model based on this linear model in 1997 .",
    "agents give positive weights to other agents only when they are close in opinion to their own opinion .",
    "so , agents may change their weights dynamically .",
    "analytical conditions for convergence to consensus are only possible for very low number of agents @xcite , so in the next step extensive computer simulations have been done together with hegselmann @xcite .",
    "then , the model got a lot of attention and is now mostly referenced as the hegselmann - krause model .    independently , deffuant and others invented a similar bounded confidence model working on a project @xciteabout improving agri - environmental policies in 2000 .",
    "partly inspired by axelrod @xcite and particle physics they proposed a model of random pairwise interaction , where agents compromise if their opinions differ not too much .",
    "both models differ a lot in the detail ( e.g. one is stochastic , one is deterministic ) but are on the other hand similar in spirit , because they both make a ` bounded confidence'-assumption for the agents .",
    "they can be represented as special cases in a general model @xcite . for this general model",
    "it is possible to prove convergence to a limit opinion configuration @xcite .",
    "but the proof does not use the bounded confidence assumption and nothing has been said about the set of all possible limit opinion configurations .",
    "this paper is to show the set of fixed points for both models ( section [ sec : agent - based - bounded ] ) .",
    "although the answer is quite plausible the proof for the hegselmann - krause model is not trivial .",
    "further on , both models have been redefined as density - based models .",
    "the idea goes back to ben - naim et al @xcite in 2002 for the deffuant - weisbuch model and has been copied for the hegselmann - krause model @xcite . both can be approximated as state - discrete interactive markov chains as done in @xcite inspired by @xcite .",
    "it has been seen in simulation that the density - based models also converge to limit opinion formations .",
    "both types of limit formations are of the same heuristic type . but",
    "a proof of convergence is lacking .",
    "this paper is furthermore to show the set of fixed points for the density - based models in their approxiamtion as interactive markov chain ( section [ sec : imc ] ) . again",
    "the answer is quite plausible but the proof for the hegselmann - krause model is not trivial .",
    "the results for the fixed points of the interactive markov chains are the central result of this paper .    in dynamical systems analysis it is natural to start finding the set of fixed points .",
    "fixed points are stable opinion configurations .",
    "we guess that the processes in the agent - based as well as density - based model converge to one point in their set of fixed points .",
    "there is strong evidence from simulation for this conjecture , but a proof is lacking for the density - based models . as a starting point",
    ", we present a lyapunov function which ensures that the density - based dynamics of the deffuant - weisbuch model can not have cycles .    the proofs for the fixed points of the interactive markov chains rely on defining the difference equation which serves as a sort of discrete master equation which give gain and loss terms for each opinion class .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath0 agents which hold continuous opinions .",
    "an opinion is a real number or respectively a vector of @xmath1 real numbers .",
    "the _ opinion space _ is thus @xmath7 .",
    "usually @xmath8 is compact and convex .",
    "the opinion of agent @xmath9 at time @xmath10 is @xmath11 , and the vector @xmath12 is the _ opinion profile _ at time @xmath13 .",
    "notice that @xmath14 is a vector of vectors for @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : vis ] shows visualisations for the dynamics in one time step of both processes in a two dimensional triangular opinion space          let there be @xmath0 agents and an appropriate opinion space @xmath16 .    given an initial profile @xmath17 , bound of confidence @xmath18 and a norm @xmath19",

    "the proof for the dw model is trivial while the proof for the hk model needs a little bit of care .",
    "it relies on the finiteness of the number of agents .",
    "the following lemma will be helpful .",
    "beforehand we define for an opinion profile @xmath36 and two agents @xmath32 as @xmath37 the hyperplane that is orthogonal to @xmath38 which goes through @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the closed half - space defined by @xmath41 which does not contain @xmath42 .",

    "we abbreviate @xmath51 . due to @xmath52 being a fixed point it must hold that @xmath53",
    "so , @xmath39 is the barycenter of all the opinions in of agents in the confidence set @xmath54 . by definition @xmath55 . due to the fact that @xmath56 and that @xmath57 is closed , the angle between @xmath58 and @xmath59 is less then @xmath60 and thus @xmath61 .",

    "if all these other agents were not in @xmath63 then @xmath39 would be an extreme point of the convex hull of the opinions of the agents in @xmath54 .",
    "thus , there must be @xmath48 such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ prop : fixabm ] let @xmath43 be a bound of confidence which defines the homogeneous hk model and the dw model on the opinion space @xmath66 .",
    "it holds that @xmath67    if @xmath52 is in the set as described in each two agents either reached consensus or are too far away from each other to interact .",

    "we assume that @xmath52 is a fixed point of the hk model and derive a contradiction .    due to lemma [ lem : fixabmhk ] there exists @xmath69 with @xmath70 with @xmath71 ( we set @xmath72 in the lemma equal to @xmath28 ) .",
