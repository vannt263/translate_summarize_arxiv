    "properties of superconductors in multiband systems can be qualitatively different from their simplest single - band @xmath4-wave counterparts . of particular interest are the states that break additional symmetries .",
    "such states can appear if the superconducting gap functions phase differences between the bands differ from @xmath5 or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "indeed in addition to the breakdown of the usual @xmath7 gauge symmetry , such superconducting states are characterized by an additional broken ( discrete ) time - reversal symmetry ( btrs ) .",
    "spontaneous breakdown of the time - reversal symmetry has various interesting physical consequences , many of which are currently being explored .",
    "iron - based superconductors @xcite are among the most promising candidates for the observation of time - reversal symmetry breaking states that originate in the multiband character of superconductivity and several competing pairing channels .",
    "experimental data suggest that in the hole - doped 122 compounds ba@xmath8k@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , the symmetry of superconducting state can change depending on the doping level @xmath10 .",
    "a typical band structure of ba@xmath8k@xmath11fe@xmath2as@xmath2 consists of two hole pockets at the @xmath12 point and two electron pockets at @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at moderate doping level @xmath15 various measurements , including arpes @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite and neutron scattering experiments",
    "@xcite , are consistent with the hypothesis of an @xmath16 state where the superconducting gap changes sign between electron and hole pockets . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetry of the superconducting state at heavy doping @xmath17 is not so clear regarding the question whether the @xmath18 channel dominates or if the gap retains @xmath16-symmetry changing sign between the inner hole bands at the @xmath12 point @xcite . indeed , there are evidences that @xmath18-wave pairing channel dominates @xcite while other arpes data were interpreted in favour of an @xmath4-wave symmetry @xcite . in both situations",
    "this implies the possible existence of an intermediate complex state that  compromises \" between the behaviours at moderate and high doping . depending on whether @xmath18 or @xmath4 channel dominates at heavy doping such a complex state is named @xmath1 or @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath1 state is isotropic and preserves crystal symmetries @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath19 state breaks the @xmath20 symmetry , while it remains invariant under combination of time - reversal symmetry operation and @xmath20 rotations .",
    "being anisotropic , it is thus qualitatively different from @xmath1 state .",
    "note that the @xmath19 superconducting state is also qualitatively different from the ( time - reversal preserving ) @xmath21 states that attracted interest in the context of high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it also contrasts with @xmath22 state , which can appear in the presence of an external magnetic field , and that violates both parity and time - reversal symmetries @xcite .",
    "while it is an interesting scenario , possibly relevant for pnictides , we will not further consider the properties of @xmath19 state and focus on a detailed analysis of @xmath1 superconducting state .",
    "this state is indeed of particular theoretical interest , being the simplest btrs extension of the most abundant @xmath4-wave state .",

    "no experimental proof of @xmath1 nor @xmath19 btrs states have been reported .",
    "indeed this requires probing the relative phases between the components of the order parameter in different bands , which is a challenging task .",
    "for example the @xmath1 state does not break the point group symmetries and is therefore not associated with an intrinsic angular momentum of cooper pairs .",
    "consequently it can not produce a local magnetic field and thus is _ a priori _",
    "invisible for conventional methods like muon spin relaxation and polar kerr effect measurements that were for example used to probe time - reversal breaking @xmath23 superconducting state in e.g. sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 compound @xcite .",
    "several proposals have been recently voiced , each with various limitations , for indirect observation of btrs signatures in pnictides .",
    "these , for example , include the investigation of the spectrum of the collective modes which includes massless @xcite and mixed phase - density @xcite excitations .",
    "also , it was proposed to consider the properties of exotic topological excitations such as skyrmions and domain walls @xcite , unconventional mechanism of vortex viscosity @xcite , formation of vortex clusters @xcite , exotic reentrant and precursor phases induced by fluctuations @xcite .",
    "spontaneous currents were predicted to exist near non - magnetic impurities in anisotropic superconducting @xmath19 states @xcite or in samples subjected to strain @xcite .",
    "the latter proposal actually involves symmetry change of @xmath1 states and relies on the presence of disorder which can typically have uncontrollable distribution .",
    "it was also recently pointed out that the time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath1 state features an unconventional contribution to the thermoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "related to this an experimental set - up , based on a local heating was recently proposed @xcite . the key idea being that local heating induces local variations of relative phases which further yield an electromagnetic response that is directly observable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : microscopic ] we start by deriving the gl expansion for a generic @xmath0-band model .",
    "then we focus on the minimal three - band microscopic model suggested to describe hole - doped 122 compounds with three superconducting gaps .",
    "there we consistently derive the two - component ginzburg - landau equations that are relevant for interband dominated pairing .",
    "next , section [ sec : glgroundstate ] is devoted to the analysis of the ground - state phases of the ginzburg - landau model . then in section [ sec : glproperties ] we introduce a reparametrization of the model that allows further investigation of the perturbative spectrum .",
    "this allows for example to derive the relevant length scales and the second critical field .",
    "finally , section [ ref : topology ] is devoted to the analysis of the topological properties of the theory , together with the possible topological excitations .",

    "[ fig : bz ] , where the dominating pairing channels are the interband repulsion between electron and hole bands , as well as between the two hole pockets at @xmath12 .",

    "this contrasts with an alternative scenario which was proposed in pnictides , the strongest interactions are the repulsions between hole and electron bands and between two electron pockets .",
    "such interaction favours order parameter sign change between electron pockets resulting in a @xmath20 symmetry breaking @xmath18-wave state .",
    "such a scenario also allows btrs phase in the form of an @xmath19 superconducting state .",

    "i.e. at a given distance @xmath238 for the core , densities are approximately constant and thus its contribution is approximated by @xmath239 this divergence , which puts an heavy energy penalty on fractional vortices , is absent if both components have the same winding . as a result",

    "if a field configuration spans only a portion of the target sphere , then the associated flux needs not to be quantized .",
