    "<S> the issue is crucial for understanding the properties of both the normal and superconducting states of these systems . for the iron pnictides , the antiferromagnetically ordered metallic ground state of the parent compounds  @xcite may arise either from the fermi surface nesting of a weak coupling theory  @xcite , or from the strong correlation effects associated with the proximity to a mott transition and the concomitant quasi - local moments  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the recently discovered alkaline iron selenide superconductors  @xcite ( a = k , rb , cs , or tl ) shed new light on this issue . in these materials the superconducting @xmath2 is comparable to that of the pnictides  @xcite , and the superconductivity is near an insulating phase  @xcite . the insulator is antiferromagnetic with a very large ordered moment  @xcite , and is intimately connected to the ordered iron vacancies  @xcite . the lack of hole pockets in the fermi surface of the superconducting compounds revealed by the arpes measurements  @xcite makes the high @xmath2 superconductivity and the large - moment magnetic order hardly explainable by the nesting mechanism . instead , they are more naturally understood in terms of the incipient mott picture . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the insulating state is naturally interpreted as a mott insulator ( mi ) , not only because it would have been metallic in the absence of interactions but also because the interactions are strong as inferred from the large ordered moment ; the enhanced interaction effects have been attributed to the band - narrowing caused by the ordered iron vacancies  @xcite . </S>",
