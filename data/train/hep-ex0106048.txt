    "in the framework of the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) the cross section of the process @xmath2 in the energy region @xmath3{s } \\sim 1 $ ] gev is determined by the amplitudes of vector mesons v ( @xmath14 ) transitions into the final state : @xmath15 . from experimental data",

    ", the interference of this amplitude with the @xmath22 amplitude can give the noticeable contribution to the total cross section .",

    "the snd detector @xcite operated since 1995 up to 2000 at the vepp-2 m @xcite collider in the energy range @xmath3{s}$ ] from 360 to 1400 mev .",
    "the detector contains several subsystems .",
    "the tracking system includes two cylindrical drift chambers .",
    "the three - layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter is based on nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the muon / veto system consists of plastic scintillation counters and two layers of streamer tubes .",

    "the total integrated luminosity accumulated in this region is about 4.3 pb@xmath42 .",
    "the data analysis and selection criteria used in this work are similar to those described in ref.@xcite . during the experimental runs ,",
    "the first - level trigger @xcite selects events with energy deposition in the calorimeter more then 200 mev and containing two or more charged particles . during processing of the experimental data the event reconstruction",

    "@xmath45 is the coordinate of the charged particle production point along the beam axis ( the longitudinal size of the interaction region is @xmath46 cm ) ; @xmath47 is the distance between the charged particle track and the beam axis in the @xmath48 plane .",
    "extra photons in @xmath2 events can appear because of the beam background overlap or nuclear interactions of the charged pions in the calorimeter . under these selection conditions ,",
    "the background sources are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 processes and the beam background .    to suppress the beam background , the following cuts on the angle between the two charged particles tracks @xmath54 and energy deposition of the neutral particles @xmath55 were applied : @xmath56 , @xmath57{s}$ ] .    to reject the background from the @xmath49 process the following cuts were imposed : @xmath58 for each charged particle , @xmath59 at least for one of them , and @xmath60",
    "here @xmath61 is an acollinearity angle in the azimuthal plane and @xmath62 is an average energy loss of a minimum ionizing particle . to suppress the @xmath63 events the energy deposition of the charged particles @xmath64 was required to be small enough : @xmath65{s}$ ] .",
    "the selected events were reconstructed under assumption that all registered particles have the common vertex in the @xmath66 interaction region .",
    "the average position of the beams interaction point and its @xmath67 spread were measured by using @xmath68 events during data collection .",
    "then a kinematic fit was performed under the following constraints : the charged particles are considered to be pions , the system has zero total momentum , the total energy is @xmath3{s}$ ] , and the photons originate from the @xmath69 decays .",
    "the value of the likelihood function @xmath70 is calculated during the fit . in events with more than two photons , extra photons",
    "are considered as spurious ones and rejected . to do this , all possible subsets of two photons",
    "were inspected and the one , corresponding to the maximum likelihood was selected .",
    "the two - photon invariant mass and @xmath70 distributions are shown in fig.[mgg ] and fig.[chi ] . after the kinematic fit",
    "the following additional cuts were applied : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . here",
    "@xmath74 is polar angle of one of the photons selected by the reconstruction program as originated from the @xmath75-decay , @xmath76 is the number of detected photons . under these criteria about @xmath4 events",
    "were selected . in fig.[dplteu3 ] and fig.[dplteu12 ] the angular distributions of pions for the selected events are shown . while fig.[dplepu45 ] and fig.[dplepu4 ] demonstrates the photon energy distributions for the same events .",
    "the difference between described selection criteria and those used in ref.@xcite is that the cuts on the pion and photon angles were relaxed here .",
    "this leads to the increase of the selected events number by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "the @xmath39 meson parameters obtained under this new selection criteria agree with results reported in the previous work .",
    "for example , the @xmath18 cross section changed by about 0.5% , what is negligible in comparison with the 5% systematic error declared in ref.@xcite .    the number of background events was estimated by using simulation in the following way : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a process number , @xmath79 is the cross section of the background process taking into account the radiative corrections , @xmath80 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath81 is the detection probability for the background process . the accuracy of the background events number determination is estimated to be about 15  20 % .",
    "the numbers of @xmath2 events ( after background subtraction ) and background event numbers are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the @xmath82 events are the main background source and their contribution is @xmath83 1% of all selected events .      for the selected events the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass spectra were formed and arranged in histograms with dipion mass range from 280 to 880 mev and bin width of 20 mev .",
    "all experimental energy points were used to produce a single invariant mass distribution . in case of the @xmath1 distribution the charged pion was selected at random from the two possibilities .",
    "the invariant mass values were calculated after the kinematic reconstruction .",
    "the expected background was subtracted bin by bin while forming the desired histograms .",
    "simulated distributions were used for subtraction of the @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 backgrounds . the @xmath82 main background",
    "was studied using experimental events .    as a rule",
    ", the background from the @xmath82 originates when @xmath84 decay inside the collider vacuum chamber is accompanied by `` photons '' in calorimeter produced due to @xmath85 meson nuclear interactions or its decay in flight inside the calorimeter . to select @xmath50 events for related background studies",
    "the following additional cuts were applied @xmath86 cm for both charged particles and @xmath87 . note that @xmath88 decay length is about 0.5 cm for our energies and the angle @xmath54 between the pions from the @xmath88 decay is about @xmath89 .",
    "the experimental and simulated `` @xmath1 '' distributions are consistent to each other ( fig.[dplkslcha ] ) , so the simulated distribution was used for the @xmath50 background subtraction in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the agreement is not so good for the `` @xmath0 '' mass spectrum : the simulated histogram is shifted from the experimental one by about 3% in the peak region ( fig.[dplkslneu ] ) .",
    "this disagreement is caused due to inaccuracies in simulation of the @xmath85 nuclear interactions .",
    "the experimental distribution ( fig.[dplkslneu ] ) was used for @xmath50 background subtraction for events in which both charged particles had @xmath90 cm .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure is not justified if at least one charged particle in the event has @xmath91 cm .",
    "indeed , `` @xmath0 '' mass distribution for the @xmath50 background depends crucially on the shape of the angle @xmath54 distribution , which in its turn depends on the value of @xmath47 , because during event reconstruction it was assumed that all charged particle tracks have a common vertex in the beams interaction region . for the @xmath84 vertex",
    "this assumption is not true .",
    "therefore , `` @xmath0 '' distribution obtained for @xmath50 background under condition @xmath90 cm can not be used for subtraction of all @xmath50 background .",
    "instead for events with @xmath91 cm for one of the charged particles the simulated distribution , corrected for the above mentioned 3% discrepancy , was used for @xmath50 background subtraction .",
    "the dipion invariant mass spectra and background contributions obtained in such a way are shown in fig.[dpleffon0 ] , [ dpleffonc ] .",

    "the @xmath111 and @xmath112 transition coupling constants could be determined in the following way : @xmath113 if these constants are equal , then the @xmath30 and @xmath29 meson widths are related as follows : @xmath114    factor @xmath115 takes into account the interaction of the @xmath9 and @xmath116 mesons in the final state @xcite .",
    "@xmath117 as a function of the pion pair invariant mass @xmath118 is shown in fig.[dplfaza ] for the @xmath66 center - of - mass energy @xmath3{s}=m_\\phi$ ] .",
    "the free parameter in our fit @xmath119 was introduced to account for possible deviations from the ref.@xcite prediction @xmath120 .",

    "so we have assumed @xmath125 in subsequent analysis .",
    "amplitudes of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 transitions have the form @xmath128 using snd measurements of the @xmath18 and @xmath129 cross sections @xcite , we can express the ratio of these amplitudes in the @xmath39-meson region as @xmath130{s}=m_\\phi.\\ ] ] the amplitude @xmath131 takes into account possible additional intermediate states in the @xmath101 transition .",
    "for example , @xmath132 transition will lead to the contribution @xmath133 where @xmath134 the ratio @xmath135 is expected to be real for energies @xmath3{s } \\simeq m_\\phi$ ] @xcite where @xmath136 so the imaginary part of ( [ a3pi ] ) is negligible due to the large @xmath137 mass ( @xmath138 mev ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath131 amplitude was assumed to be real in our analysis .",
    "the experimental dipion mass spectra ( tables [ tab7 ] and [ tab8 ] ) were fitted with theoretical distributions . using the @xmath18 cross section ( [ ds ] )",

    "the monte - carlo sample of about @xmath158 @xmath159 events were processed in the same way as experimental data .",

    "the cut @xmath163 is also a source of some error in the detection efficiency determination , due to inaccuracies in the extra photons simulation .",

    "in fact , if the extra photons originate from the beam background overlap , @xmath163 criteria does not modify the detection efficiency dependence on a dipion mass , because the probability of beam background overlap does not depend on dipion mass . on the contrary ,",
    "the probability of extra photons appearance because of nuclear interactions of the charged pions does depend on pion energy .",
    "therefore any inaccuracy in simulation of these nuclear interactions will transform in inaccuracies in the simulation of extra photons and can lead to the detection efficiency error which will depend on the dipion mass . to correct this error we used the correction factor obtained in the following way : @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the event numbers in the @xmath78th bin of experimental and simulated mass spectra respectively under condition @xmath167 .",
