    "within the framework of hierarchical structure formation , large spiral galaxies like the milky way or andromeda ( m31 ) arose from the merger of many small galaxies and protogalaxies which began coalescing at high redshift . during this process ,",
    "considerable dynamical and chemical evolution took place , as the primordial galaxy fragments were assimilated , stellar populations evolved and fed enriched gas back into the interstellar medium , and fresh gas was accreted onto the galaxy .",
    "the disk , the defining component of spiral galaxies , formed through dissipative processes , growing from the inside out mainly by the accretion of gas with high angular momentum with probably only a small component of accreted stars @xcite .",
    "the structure of disks is generally exponential in both their radial and vertical directions .",
    "a striking feature of this component of galaxies is the tendency for it to be truncated radially at 34 scale - lengths @xcite .",
    "this distance would correspond to @xmath9 in the milky way and @xmath10 in m31 .",
    "although we still lack a solid understanding of how and why these truncations occur , evidence suggests an abrupt change in the star formation efficiency across this boundary , perhaps related to a shift in the dominant star formation mode @xcite . the fact that disk stars are detected beyond the predicted truncation radii in the milky way and m31 , as well as in several lower mass galaxies ( e.g. ngc  300 , @xcite ; m33 , ferguson et al 2005 , in prep ) , is intriguing .",
    "did these stars form _ in situ _ ?",
    "if so , did they form a long time ago during the very early stages of disk evolution , or have they formed much more recently from newly - acquired gas ? on the other hand , could they have been tidally stripped from infalling satellites on close to coplanar orbits ?    in order to address these questions and examine galaxy formation models in detail , our group has undertaken a deep panoramic study of the andromeda galaxy , which when set in contrast with the milky way , was to serve as a test case against which formation simulations could be compared .",
    "studies of the milky way are naturally blessed with more photons that those of more distant systems , and by resolving individual stars and measuring their kinematic and chemical properties one can study the formation of our galaxy in a detail and with a mass and spatial resolution that can only be dreamed of elsewhere .",
    "however , thanks to advances in instrumentation , it is now also possible to measure the kinematics and chemistry of individual stars in galaxies of the local group .",
    "one of the major benefits that this affords us is a global view of a galaxy , freeing us from much of the projection uncertainties that our position within the milky way plagues us with , and yet retaining the fine detail that spectroscopic studies of resolved stellar populations provide .    located at a distance of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) , andromeda is the closest giant spiral galaxy to our own , and the only other giant galaxy in the local group . as such it is often considered to be the `` sister '' galaxy to the milky way .",
    "recent studies suggest that the two galaxies do indeed have very similar total masses ( including the dark matter , @xcite ) , yet there are significant differences between them .",
    "m31 is slightly more luminous than the milky way , it has a higher rotation curve , and a bulge with higher velocity dispersion .",
    "m31 possesses and a globular cluster system with @xmath13 members , approximately three times more numerous than that of the milky way , and contains several members of a type of luminous extended cluster not present around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the disk of andromeda is also much more extensive , with a scale - length of @xmath14 ( r - band value corrected for a distance of @xmath15 , @xcite ) compared to @xmath16 for the milky way @xcite ; but which is currently forming stars at a lower rate than the galaxy @xcite .",
    "though possibly the consequence of low - number statistics , it is tempting to attribute significance to the fact that andromeda has four dwarf elliptical galaxies ( m32 , ngc  205 , ngc  147 , ngc  185 ) among its entourage of satellites and no star - forming dwarf irregulars , whereas the milky way has none of the former but two of the latter . however , it is perhaps in their halo populations that the differences between the two galaxies are most curious and most interesting .",
    "it has been known for many years that m31 does not possess the `` text - book '' stellar halo model developed from observations of the milky way .",
    "minor axis halo fields have shown startlingly high metallicities ( @xmath17 \\sim -0.5}$ ] ) and an @xmath18-law density profile @xcite , unlike the @xmath19 behavior of the metal - poor galactic halo @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies of m31 confirm that an old , metal - poor halo lurks beneath @xcite .",
    "both the de vaucouleurs profile and the high metallicity are suggestive of an active merger history at the time of halo ( or bulge ) formation .",
    "the photometric dataset that forms the foundation of this study was obtained with the wide field camera at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ; the survey and preliminary results were presented in @xcite and @xcite , though the full completed survey will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming article ( irwin et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the density of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars throughout the survey region , which now covers @xmath20  sq .",
    "degrees , is reproduced in figure  1 , onto which we have superimposed the familiar digital sky survey image .",
    "the solid angle covered by the survey corresponds to a projected area of @xmath21 at the distance of m31 .",
    "as shown in the earlier publications in this series , the int survey revealed a wealth of substructure throughout the `` halo '' of m31 .",
    "however , the most prominent of the details that we uncovered was the presence of a gigantic extended flattened structure around m31 , spanning up to @xmath20  kpc from the galaxy centre , almost twice the maximum extent of the bright inner disk . due to the expectations from galaxy formation simulations with",
    "cold dark matter , our initial interpretation of this structure favored the possibility that it was a flattened inner halo @xcite with significant spatial sub - structure @xcite .",
    "however , the proximity of m31 has allowed us to follow up these detections with deep keck / deimos spectroscopic observations ( initial results of the spectroscopic survey were presented in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the radial velocities and metallicities derived from these deep spectroscopic data that we present and analyze in this contribution .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2",
    "we first discuss the global geometry of m31 , the inclination angle of the disk and fit an exponential function to the major axis photometry .",
    "the spectroscopic observations are presented in  3 , and the resulting kinematics in  4 . in ",
    "5  we examine several fields in more detail , presenting also their mean metallicity and fitting global trends .",
    "these data are interpreted in  6 , where we present several possibilities for the formation of the structure , and we finish in  7  with the conclusions of the study .",
    "before describing the observations and analysis of the kinematic dataset , it is useful to discuss the large - scale structure of m31 . andromeda is observed highly inclined to the line of sight with @xmath22 @xcite , and it is seen on the sky with a position angle of @xmath23 east of north @xcite . within an angular distance of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xcite find a good fit with the sum of a bulge model together with a disk model of r - band scale - length @xmath26 ( corrected for a distance of @xmath15 ) .    to compare these findings to our int survey",
    ", we measure the source density in a color - magnitude box designed to select the brightest rgb stars 1.5 magnitudes below the rgb tip .",
    "sources with i - band magnitudes between @xmath27 and colors @xmath28 are selected .",
    "( the @xcite dust maps are used throughout this work to correct the int photometry for extinction ) .",
    "we correct the star - counts for crowding using the approach of @xcite , and subtract a small background count as determined from fields at the edge of the survey .",
    "the de - projected positions of the rgb stars are binned in a polar coordinate grid with @xmath29 azimuthal bins and @xmath30 radial bins",
    ". the azimuthal counts at a given radius are then medianed together in groups of 5 ( i.e. covering @xmath31 ) , and we step around the circle in intervals of @xmath32 .",
    "the upper panel of figure  2 shows the 4 profiles within a de - projected angle of @xmath33 of the major axis ( i.e. @xmath34 projected ) , assuming an inclination of @xmath35 , with the additional thick - lined profile showing the median of all 14 bins of @xmath29 width .",
    "positive radius means that the medianed area is on the north - eastern major axis , and negative radius on the south - western major axis .",
    "the abscissa @xmath36 is a de - projected radius , that assumes the stated inclination .",
    "the artificial drop in the source counts inside of @xmath37 is due to crowding .",
    "-de - projected azimuthal bins , assuming a galaxy inclination of @xmath38 .",
    "the 4 profiles to the north - east cover the de - projected angles @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with the 4 profiles to the south - west being identical cuts rotated by @xmath43 .",
    "the thick black line corresponds to the median of all 14 azimuthal bins between @xmath44 .",
    "the lower panel shows an exponential fit to the medianed profile between @xmath45 , with a scale - length @xmath46 . ]",
    "evidently the major axis profile is close to exponential ; it is fit in the lower panel with a model ( dashed line ) of scale - length @xmath47 .",
    "this scale - length is similar to that of the inner disk , so it appears that the large - scale properties of the outer disk structure follow on smoothly from those of the inner disk .",
    "the upper panel of figure  3 shows the profiles for all azimuthal bins .",
    "the large discrepancies between the different profiles are very obvious , with the less steep profiles corresponding to azimuthal bins towards the minor axis .",
    "the higher number densities on the minor axis are largely due to the huge bulge component in m31 .",
    "indeed , in the bulge - disk decomposition of @xcite , the bulge dominates over the disk at all radii on the minor axis .",
    "however , part of this variation may also come from a change in the inclination of the galaxy at large radius . to explore this possibility , we fitted the value of @xmath48 by assuming that the most likely inclination is that that has the lowest root mean square dispersion about the median profile in the distance interval @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding profiles are shown on the lower panel of figure  3 , together with the medianed profile ( thick black line ) .",
    "the fitted inclination angle is @xmath50 .     from each other , assuming a galaxy inclination of @xmath51 .",
    "as in figure  2 , each profile is constructed from a median of 5 consecutive azimuthal bins of width @xmath29 .",
    "the thick black line corresponds to the median of all azimuthal bins .",
    "the lower panel shows similar profiles , but for a an inclination angle of @xmath52 , fitted to minimize the dispersion around the median profile of all azimuthal bins over the interval @xmath53 . ]    with this smaller inclination , the surface density profiles are now much more similar , yet there are still variations between the profiles of up to a factor of @xmath54@xmath55 at a given radius , due in part to the presence of obvious `` lumps '' .",
    "fitting the median profile between @xmath56 with an exponential - law yields a scale - length of @xmath57 .",
    "this larger scale - length value compared to the previous major axis exponential fit demonstrates a failure in our simple tilted disk model . a more complex model with a bulge component",
    "is required to fit the central regions of the galaxy more reliably , yet this can not be constructed from our int data which are highly incomplete inside of @xmath58 .    in the following discussion , we will present results based on inclination values of @xmath59 and @xmath50 ; this will help clarify the uncertainty due to a possible tilt of the outer disk with respect to the inner disk .",
    "de - projected quantities , such as the de - projected radius @xmath36 or the velocity lag @xmath60 ( defined below ) will implicitly assume an inclination of @xmath59 ; primed versions of these variables ( e.g. @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) will instead correspond to the lower inclination case of @xmath50 .",
    "during eight keck nights ( @xmath63% useful time ) in sept .",
    "2002 , 2003 , and 2004 , we undertook a deimos program to spectroscopically follow - up the detected substructures in m31 to measure their kinematics , and to begin a complete kinematic portrait of m31 targeting systematically disk and halo fields .",
    "the observing runs have employed the standard high - res _ deep2 _",
    "slitmask approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) covering the wavelength range 64009000 , with a spectral resolution of @xmath640.6 .",
    "the observations have also pioneered two new approaches with deimos : a band - limiting @xmath65  ca  ii triplet filter to multiplex @xmath66 slitlets in the spectral direction yielding as many as 800 slits per mask , and a ` fibre - hole ' @xmath67 slitlet approach packing @xmath68 holes per mask .",
    "this ` fibre - hole ' approach adopted in sept .",
    "2004 proved to be very successful , giving poisson - limited sky - subtraction ( down to i=21.5 ) by assigning holes to monitor the sky spectrum ; longer slitlets simply waste valuable ccd real - estate in regions of high target density .",
    "the fiber - hole diameters were milled at @xmath67 to match the median seeing .",
    "the dataset presented in this paper is the sum of all the ` standard mask ' spectra plus ` fibre - holes ' spectra obtained up to september 2004 that do not use the band - limiting filter .",
    "a total of 28 fields were observed in this way .",
    "the layout of these spectroscopic fields is displayed in figure  4 : the 5 fields d1d5 probe the m31 disk , the 16 fields f1f16 probe both the halo and what we considered to be `` halo '' overdensities , while 7 fields were assigned to investigate the dynamics of the giant stream @xcite which is seen clearly in figure  1 as an elongated structure to the south - east of m31 .        for each of these fields except the stream fields",
    ", the highest priority targets were selected for observation from the int survey within a color - magnitude box with i - band magnitudes between @xmath69 ( without reddening correction ) and colors @xmath70 .",
    "this broad selection was designed to pick out a wide range of red - giant branch stars , containing both metal - poor and metal - rich populations ( further details will be provided in irwin   2005 , in prep ) .",
    "other non - saturated targets brighter than @xmath71 were also chosen by an automated selection algorithm at lower priority to fill in available space on the spectrograph detector .",
    "each mask was observed for typically three integrations of 20min each .",
    "the spectroscopic images were processed and combined using the pipeline software developed by our group .",
    "this software debiasses , performs a flat - field , extracts , wavelength - calibrates and sky - subtracts the spectra .",
    "the radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating against a model template with gaussian functions at the rest - frame wavelength positions of the ca  ii triplet lines ( the technique used is similar to that discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "an estimate of the radial velocity uncertainty is then obtained for each star from the dispersion of the radial velocity measured from the three ca  ii triplet lines separately .",
    "the accuracy of these data are very good for such faint stars , with typical uncertainties of @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "the sample presented in this paper consists of 2834 stars with velocity uncertainties @xmath74 that fall into the above rgb color - magnitude selection window .",
    "the velocity distribution of all the targeted stars with @xmath75 is displayed on the top panel of figure  5 .",
    "this distribution is a mixture of bona - fide m31 stars plus a contamination from galactic stars .",
    "we have superimposed the expected galactic contribution over a @xmath76 area in the direction of m31 according to the besanon galactic starcounts model @xcite , onto which we have applied the color - magnitude selection window used for spectroscopic target selection .",
    "since we have not observed every star in each field , and since the ratio of m31 to milky way stars varies dramatically from the inner fields to the outer fields , we can not easily scale the model predictions . for the illustrative purposes of figure  5",
    ", we have chosen a normalization to match the besanon model to our observed distribution for velocities higher than the peak in the model .",
    "we will return to the issue of galactic contamination in our analysis of field f16 ( figure  24 ) , placing an upper limit on the model normalisation , which shows that galactic contamination is low at heliocentric radial velocities below @xmath77 .",
    "it is clear from a visual comparison of the distributions in figure  5 that we observe a large number of stars in significant excess over the expected distribution of contaminants .",
    "the apparent mismatch between the peak in the observed distribution and the besanon model is due to the large number of stars observed in the disk fields d1d5 on the north - eastern side of andromeda , which combine in this summed - up plot to give a broader peak centered on @xmath78 .",
    "if we instead sum up the 11 fields on the south - western side of m31 ( fields f1f4 and all the stream fields ) , the rotation of the m31 disk separates galactic stars from the majority of stars in andromeda , allowing a cleaner discrimination .",
    "this is shown on the bottom panel of figure  5 .",
    "these considerations show that by selecting stars with velocities @xmath79 we can drastically minimize the galactic contamination , incurring only the penalty of including a small fraction of galactic halo stars into our sample ; furthermore these galactic halo stars are expected to have a relatively flat distribution in radial velocity .        due to the wide coverage of the spectroscopic fields , it is useful to compare the observed velocity of a star with the expected radial velocity of a population moving in circular orbits .",
    "we construct a simple model assuming the geometrical model discussed in  2 .",
    "we adopt the circular velocity curve compilation of @xcite , which joins co measurements from @xcite for @xmath80 with measurements by @xcite at larger radii ; these data are reproduced in figure  6 , along with our spline fit which is shown adjusted for the small inclination correction .",
    "the dip in the rotation curve near @xmath81 is of course an artifact of non - circular motions in the gas at that location , and is unimportant for the present work since our fields all lie beyond that radius .",
    "the corresponding map of the projected rotation velocity over the inner region of our survey is shown in figure  7 .    , and from the rotation velocity of the @xcite beyond that radius .",
    "the dotted line shows a spline fit to these data , while the continuous line indicates the correction for the @xmath82 inclination of the inner disk of this galaxy . ]    in reality , the m31 disk has finite thickness , and due to the highly inclined orientation that it presents to us , lines of sight through the disk will probe a substantial depth .",
    "this is a concern as the simple circular velocity model of figure  7 could be misleading , since stars at a given @xmath83 on the sky can be located at different radii in m31 , and will also present different projections to us . in figure  8",
    "we show the velocity uncertainty caused by a disk scale - height of @xmath84 , a value comparable to the scale - height of the old disk of the milky way @xcite . for most of the survey area the additional uncertainty to the circular velocity model due to a disk of that thickness is less than @xmath73 , though certain regions within the inner ellipse the uncertainty is @xmath85",
    ". we will bear this consideration in mind when discussing the kinematic properties of the disk .",
    "we now proceed to present the velocity data .",
    "the upper panel of figure  9 shows the ( heliocentric ) radial velocity measurements as a function of @xmath86 , the major axis distance for the disk fields labeled d1d5 and which lie within the inner ellipse of figures 1 and 4 ( corresponding to a disk radius @xmath87 ) ; a small number of stars from field f13 also fall into this selection .",
    "the dashed line here marks a heliocentric velocity of @xmath88 , the adopted systemic velocity of m31 .",
    "non - rotating populations such as might be expected for the stellar halo , will scatter in a broad distribution around this line . in these north - eastern fields , the disk lies at radial velocities above the systemic value , so counter - rotating populations can be identified from their location below the dashed line .",
    "the bottom panel shows the result of subtracting the model of figure  7 from the velocity data on a star by star basis ( rather than using a single value for a whole field ) .",
    "stars on circular orbits in the plane of the disk lie at a disk - corrected velocity of @xmath89 ( emphasized with a dashed line ) .",
    "field d1 ( at a major axis distance of @xmath90 ) appears to be peculiar with an intriguing kinematic sub - structure at heliocentric velocity of @xmath91 ; we will discuss this structure in a subsequent contribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that this sub - structure was only detected through its kinematic signature , as there is no clear overdensity in our maps of rgb stars in this field .",
    "however , the disk fields d2d5 ( located at major axis distances between @xmath92 ) show a very similar distribution of stars , with a broad halo component below @xmath93 , and a well - populated peak lagging circular orbits only slightly . in figure  10",
    "we show the distribution of disk lag velocities for fields d2d5 , together with a gaussian fit of the data between @xmath94 , which has a mean of @xmath95 with dispersion of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "the dash - dotted line shows a similar maximum - likelihood gaussian fit , this time taking into account the estimated velocity uncertainty on the individual velocity measurements , and also the uncertainty in the disk rotation model ( from figure  8) .",
    "this fit , which has @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , shows that the dispersion of the population is not artificially enhanced to any significant extent by our line of sight depth through these fields .",

    "to @xmath103 in figure  9 ) .",
    "the large peak between @xmath104 can be fit with a gaussian ( dashed line ) of mean @xmath105 and dispersion @xmath106 ( @xmath107 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "the fit does not change significantly if we take into account the estimated velocity errors and the disk rotation model uncertainties displayed in figure  8 , we obtain then ( dot - dashed line ) @xmath108 , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 , @xmath102 ) . ]",
    "as discussed above , contamination from milky way stars can be problematic for @xmath111 ; however the m31 disk has very high contrast in these inner fields ( d1d5 ) , with a source surface density in our cmd selection window that is 20 times higher than in the halo field f7 , so we expect the galactic contamination to be small , 5% at the very most . thus we find that the dominant population in the inner regions of m31 is a thin disk population with a dispersion of @xmath112 that trails circular orbits by @xmath113 ; these values are reasonably similar to the measurements of the velocity dispersion of the galactic disk in the solar neighborhood where the velocity ellipsoid has axes @xmath114 and the population lags the circular velocity with an asymmetric drift of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric drift of the m31 population will be discussed further in  6.1 .",
    "note that the very inclined orientation of m31 means that we do not have access to the vertical dispersion @xmath116 .",
    "the measured @xmath117 is a mixture of the radial and azimuthal components @xmath118 and @xmath119 , dependent on the field under study .",
    "for simplicity we neglect this distinction in the present discussion , referring to a single @xmath117 .     to @xmath120 . ]",
    "having shown that the inner fields have kinematics typical of a canonical thin disk , we now examine the outer field data .",
    "the fields lying on the giant stellar stream ( those prefixed by the letter s in figure  4 ) are removed from the sample for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this leaves a total of 16 fields marked f1f16 on figure  4 .",
    "the measured radial velocities in these fields are displayed as a function of major axis distance on the top panel of figure  11 . for clarity ,",
    "we have removed from this sample all stars with heliocentric velocities @xmath121 , thereby minimizing the galactic contamination (  galactic model in figure  5 ) .",
    "there is a wealth of kinematic substructure in these fields ( chapman  2005 , in prep ) , and a significant halo population seen scattered around the systemic velocity ( dashed line ) ; however the dominant population in these fields again follows closely the disk rotation .",
    "this can be seen on the bottom panel of figure  11 , where we have corrected the data on the upper panel for the rotation model of figure  7 . in the fields at major axis distance between @xmath122 ,",
    "the numerous population stands out clearly with `` disk - corrected velocity '' between @xmath123 and @xmath124 . on this south - western side of m31",
    ", these velocities correspond to a lagging behind the . on the opposite side of the disk , at major axis distances @xmath125",
    ", a similar concentration is found with `` disk - corrected velocity '' between @xmath77 and @xmath123 , this again corresponds to a lagging velocity behind the gas .    for completeness ,",
    "in figure  12 we show the same velocity data as a function of minor axis distance , @xmath126 .",
    "it is clear from this diagram that the halo fields f5 and f7 ( the two fields at minor axis distance @xmath127 ) do not contribute significantly ( if at all ) to the peaked velocity structure that rotates as a disk .        figure  13 shows the distribution of velocity lag @xmath60 in the 16 fields under consideration .",
    "the velocity lag is defined to be equal to the disk - corrected velocity for fields at positive major axis distance , but is inverted for fields at negative major axis distance .",
    "each panel is labeled with the field name and as well as three numbers which give the major axis distance @xmath86 , the minor axis distance @xmath126 and the de - projected m31-plane radius @xmath36 , of the centre of each field , all in kpc .",
    "a striking feature of these distributions is the presence of a narrow component in most of the fields , which lags the circular velocity by merely @xmath128 , that is to say a population which has distinctly disk - like kinematics . yet",
    "this is a startling finding , since these fields are extremely distant from m31 , lying at radial distances between @xmath129 and more than @xmath130 .",
    "that this behavior is the most salient kinematic feature of the survey is demonstrated in figure  14 , which shows the distribution of velocity lag as a function of the m31-plane radial distance , r , for all stars in the survey in non - stream fields with @xmath131 .",

    "the majority of these stars display small velocity lags ( @xmath133 ) , and are therefore rotating rapidly .",

    "summing the velocity lag distributions in all the outer non - stream fields ( except for f6 to remove any concern regarding contamination from ngc  205  this will be discussed further in  5.4 ) gives the distribution shown in figure  15 .",
    "this distribution is very similar to that previously constructed for the inner fields (  figure  10 ) , showing again a broad halo distribution with the addition of a very strong peak , in this case centered at @xmath134 with a dispersion of @xmath135 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) .",

    "it is highly unlikely that this structure is bound , as this would require some @xmath152 of dark matter , given the velocity dispersion and extent .",

    "the stars that gives rise to the narrow kinematic spike are dispersed spatially over the whole deimos field , so the structure is not simply a cluster . the small velocity dispersion and the mean velocity almost exactly on the expected circular rotation imply that the the population is almost certainly young .",
    "the population in the broad kinematic peak is again very similar to the peak that we observe in field f1 and in the inner fields d2d5 .",
    "field f3 is located towards the south - west of m31 , on a dense elongated structure that trails behind the disk in a way that is reminiscent of a tidal stream or the end of a spiral arm ( see figure  18 ) .",
    "though the velocity dispersion of @xmath162 is relatively low in this field , the color - magnitude position of the stars that populate the kinematic peak is very similar to that seen in other fields .",
    "figure  19 shows the velocity and color - magnitude data for field f6 , centered on the northern edge of ngc  205 , one of the dwarf elliptical satellite galaxies of andromeda .",
    "the distribution of velocities has a narrow peak centered at @xmath163 with dispersion @xmath164 ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) .",

    "the new data in field f8 ( adjacent to field f9 ) do not show the bimodal distribution found by @xcite , which suffered from a small sample size .",
    "instead the only significant stellar population present has , yet again , disk - like kinematics with a dispersion of @xmath168 centered at @xmath169 ( @xmath170 , @xmath171 ) .",

    "field f16 is situated in a particularly interesting location , on the north - eastern end of our survey region ( see figure  23 ) , where our int survey detected a very extended very low surface brightness structure .",
    "it lies at the greatest projected radius ( @xmath174 ) of all the non - stream fields we observed .",
    "@xcite argue that this object ( which they call andromeda ne ) may be one of the most low mass and low surface brightness galaxies found to date or possibly torn - off material from the disk of m31 .",
    "the radial velocity distribution in the bottom left - hand panel of figure  23 shows a well - defined narrow peak of dispersion @xmath175 centered at @xmath176 ( @xmath177 , @xmath178 ) . however , this field is the only one in our survey in which there could be some concern about galactic contamination affecting significantly the fitted disk - like peak . in figure  24",

    "the predictions of the besanon galaxy model are superposed ( green histogram ) normalised to the @xmath180 field of view of deimos , but corrected for the ratio of available to observed targets in our cmd selection window . thus according to this model , below @xmath181",
    "the galactic contribution will be minor , and can be neglected .",

    "the stars partaking in this spike are uniformly distributed over the field , and they have a similar color spread to the other stars in the sample ( the corresponding points are circled in the cmd on the bottom right - hand panel ) .",
    "this lack of distinct properties , together with the low statistics indicate that this spike is most probably an insignificant ( @xmath183 ) random deviation .    , which strengthens the results presented in figure  23 .",
    "]      the remaining outer non - stream fields : f4 , f5 , f7 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f13 , f14 and f15 , do not individually possess a narrow and strong velocity peak near the expected velocity of a circularly rotating population ( see figure  13 ) .",
    "however , by summing the fields together we can enhance the signal to detect a global population which lags the disk by a similar velocity .",
    "the nine fields that were added together cover a very large area over our survey .",
    "some fields , in particular the halo field f7 , are almost certainly devoid of any disk stars , so the `` disk velocity lag '' is not a meaningful quantity , and will contribute only noise to the summed distribution .",
    "nevertheless , figure  25 shows that a narrow peak is again detected , albeit with a large population of `` contaminants '' , this time stemming mostly from the halo population of m31 itself . due to the kinematic substructure in the halo population ( which will be presented in a forthcoming paper , chapman et al .",
    ", in prep . ) we can not easily remove the halo `` contamination '' to enhance the signal of the disk - like peak . nevertheless , to help guide the eye ,",
    "we have used a maximum likelihood algorithm to fit a gaussian function to the velocity data windowed between @xmath184 , which we find to be centered on @xmath185 with dispersion @xmath186 ( @xmath139 , @xmath187 ) .",
    "although the reliability of this fit is clearly compromised by the strong halo contamination , the similarity of this peak with those presented in figures  16 to 23 is very striking .",

    "the spectra also allow a measurement of the metallicity of the targeted stars from the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the ca  ii triplet absorption lines .",
    "while the noise in individual spectra is typically too high to yield a useful measurement of the ca  ii equivalent widths , we proceeded to estimate the average metallicity by stacking the rgb star spectra of the targets within @xmath148 of the fitted peaks of the fields displayed in figures 16 to 23 ( the corresponding stars are also highlighted in the cmd panels ) .",
    "the spectra are shifted to zero velocity before stacking .",
    "we follow as closely as possible the method of @xcite , fitting moffat functions to the ca  ii lines .",
    "the average spectrum yields a measurement of the ca  ii triplet equivalent width used to estimate the metallicity as @xmath190 =   -2.66   + 0.42 [ \\sigma   ca   -   0.64 ( v_{hb }   -   v_{ave})]$ ] , with @xmath191 , @xmath192 being a surface gravity correction relative to the @xmath193 magnitude of the horizontal branch , and @xmath194 the average ( luminosity weighted ) magnitude of the stars in the field .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath195 for m31 , measured by @xcite .",
    "the resulting combined spectra are displayed in figure  26 , along with the metallicity measurement ( on the @xcite scale ) .",
    "the typical uncertainty is @xmath196  mags . by chance",
    ", the @xmath197 line in the summed spectrum in field  16 falls at the location of a night - sky line , so the two other ca  ii were used in that instance . for comparison to the inner fields , on the top panel of figure  26 we also display the summed spectrum of the disk fields d2d5 , derived from those stars within @xmath148 of the fit shown in figure  10 .",
    "these metallicity measurements are all very similar , identical within the uncertainties , and agree reasonably well with the position of the targets relative to our fiducial clusters on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this yields further evidence that the dominant population in the majority of the fields we surveyed starting from the disk populations at a radius of @xmath1 out to @xmath198 are probing different parts of the same global population , which has metallicity of @xmath150 = -0.9}$ ] .     of the gaussian fit .",
    "the three ca  ii triplet lines at 8498.02 , 8542.09 , and 8662.14  are the most obvious features of these spectra .",
    "the field name is indicated on the left , and derived metallicities on the right of each panel . ]",
    "a further useful constraint on the nature of this disk - like population is its density profile .",
    "we proceed by measuring the number @xmath199 of stars within @xmath148 of the narrow peaks shown in figure  10 and figures 16 to 23 , and count the number of observed targets @xmath200 in the cmd selection window , and also the number of available targets @xmath201 within the selection window that fall into the deimos field of view .",
    "the local density in a field is estimated as @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the background density computed from fields at the edge of the survey .",
    "the top panel of figure  27 shows the resulting rgb star density profile , under the assumption of the standard @xcite inclination angle of @xmath51 .",
    "the profile shows an exponential decline to @xmath204 , at which point there appears to be a break in the relation , with possibly a flat extension from @xmath205 to @xmath206 .",
    "fitting the data at @xmath207 , we measure an exponential scale - length of @xmath208 .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the @xmath47 scale - length ( dotted line ) that we fitted earlier to the major axis star - counts . if we instead assume the lower inclination angle calculated in  2   of @xmath209 ( lower panel ) , the scale - length drops marginally to @xmath210 .",
    "is assumed to calculate both the de - projected radius @xmath36 and the de - projected surface density .",
    "the dashed line shows an exponential fit to the data in the range @xmath211 , which implies a scale - length of @xmath212 .",
    "the dotted line reproduces the fit to the outer major axis profile of figure  2 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "field f6 is not included in this plot since it lies on the dwarf galaxy ngc  205 , whose stars enhance enormously the number of possible targets in the deimos field .",
    "the lower panel shows the same data for @xmath209 .",
    "the fitted exponential function has scale - length @xmath214 .",
    "the dotted line again reproduces the fit of figure  2 , corrected for the difference in inclination angle . ]",
    "these longer scale - lengths may mean that the population with disk - like kinematics that we have uncovered in these fields has a slightly different profile to the underlying exponential population revealed in figure  2 , or it may also mean that the inclination of the outer disk is lower than @xmath50 . however , it should be recalled that the spectroscopic fields preferentially targeted overdensities detected in the photometric survey , which need not follow closely the medianed major axis profile .",
    "another important property to bear in mind when interpreting figure  27 is that the velocity distributions in all fields showed narrow peaks at a similar velocity lag .",
    "there was no indication of bimodal distributions with a component due to an underlying smooth `` normal '' disk plus an additional component due to the sub - structure ( with the exception of field f2 which we discussed in  5.2 ) . if there were an underlying normal disk population it has identical kinematics to the substructure .      in terms of its mass fraction ,",
    "the outer disk is a very significant part of the galaxy .",
    "as we have shown in figure  2 , the exponential decline can be followed out to @xmath215 or @xmath216 scale - lengths .",
    "approximately 10% of the mass of the m31 disk therefore lies beyond the typical @xmath217 scale - length cutoff @xcite .",
    "this region contains an even larger fraction of the angular momentum of the disk : assuming a flat rotation curve results in @xmath218% of the angular momentum of the disk residing beyond 4 scale - lengths .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented an analysis of green bank telescope @xmath219 observations of m31 and its environment .",
    "their very high sensitivity of @xmath220 within a beam - size of @xmath221 allowed them to detect many low - mass clouds as well as an extended filamentary component .",
    "a careful inspection of their figure  1 , in which the data - cube is presented , reveals a spatial overlap between the emission and our extended disk fields .",
    "furthermore , the velocities of the gas coincide with the peaks of the extended disk velocity distributions found in the present study , though a detailed comparison is not currently possible as the velocity intervals in the map presented by @xcite are large ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams presented in figures 1623 show a very similar broad upper rgb , indicating that a similar distribution of stars populates these fields .",
    "however , recent work by our group @xcite using very deep photometry from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) instrument on board the hubble space telescope reveals significant differences in the morphology of the horizontal branch over the inner part of the m31 `` halo '' .",
    "the surveyed fields include small areas of the fields f1 , f5 , f9 , f10 , f11 and f12 from the present study .",
    "the differences in the horizontal - branch populations testify to the existence of inhomogenities in the _ old _ stellar populations in these fields .",
    "our radial velocity data reveal the presence of an unexpected population , present in almost all the surveyed fields from @xmath223 out to @xmath206 , that lags the by at most @xmath224 , and that has a dispersion of @xmath225 to @xmath142 .",
    "this velocity dispersion is large enough to rule out the possibility that these structures are bound dwarf galaxies .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the circularly - rotating disk model that we presented in figure  7 is very simplistic , and one should expect significant deviations from it , especially on fields at large @xmath126 ( minor axis distance ) , where small changes in the inclination of the disk , due for instance to warping , will cause large errors in the disk velocity lag .",
    "so the good agreement in the mean velocity of the disk - like peak in each field is all the more surprising .",
    "the direction of the effect is such that if the disk is warped so that it is seen less edge - on , the model of figure  7 will overestimate the rotational velocity , and a population will appear to run ahead of circular motion .",
    "the errors in the model , however , will not affect significantly the fitted @xmath117 in each field .",
    "the variations in @xmath117 in the outer fields are large , ranging between @xmath226 in field f3 and @xmath227 in field f8 . field f2",
    "( with @xmath228 ) mirrors field f3 about the major axis , so we can see that the differences in velocity dispersion reflect real changes between fields , which are not just due to different projections of the @xmath36 and @xmath229 components of the velocity ellipsoid onto the line of sight .    for the metallicity measurements",
    "we are unfortunately forced to co - add the spectra in the velocity peaks to obtain combined spectra of useful signal to noise .",
    "this necessarily means that we lose all information on the metallicity dispersion of the populations .",
    "nevertheless , the mean metallicity can be measured reliably , and the derived values in all fields are consistent with the data from each field being drawn from a global population of identical metallicity .",
    "all the deimos fields we present in this paper , except for fields f5 and f7 were positioned on regions of high target density in m31 , which is seen as the dark black area in a visual inspection of figure  1 .",
    "this corresponds to a surface number density of stars of approximately @xmath230 degree@xmath231 in the rgb selection window defined in  3 .",
    "the panoramic view of the int survey provides an invaluable complement to the spectroscopic results .",
    "given the very similar velocity dispersions , disk velocity lags and metallicities of the stars we have identified , it is clear from an inspection of figure  1 that these populations can be united in a single morphological entity : an extended disk - like structure which has rather remarkable well - defined fragmented sub - structures at its outer edge .      we have found a population that appears to lag the velocity of circular orbits in many fields , but what does this lag represent ?",
    "a simple answer may be that , in reality , the outer disk is less inclined than we modeled .",
    "however , some fraction of the velocity lag must be intrinsic . in an equilibrium disk , a stellar population with",
    "non - zero velocity dispersion lags the circular speed ; this is known as the asymmetric drift ( see ,   @xcite , their  4.2 ) .",
    "we use eqn .",
    "4 - 35 of @xcite to estimate the expected asymmetric drift , and adopt their simplifying assumptions taken to calculate the solar neighborhood asymmetric drift relation .",
    "figure  28 shows the expected asymmetric drift as a function of radius for disk populations of dispersion @xmath232 ( dotted line ) , @xmath233 ( continuous line ) and @xmath234 ( dashed line ) .",
    "these estimates show that a significant velocity lag should be expected .",
    "-component of velocity dispersion : @xmath235 ( dotted line ) , @xmath236 ( continuous line ) and @xmath237 ( dashed line ) .",
    "a scale - length of @xmath238 , as measured in  2 , was adopted . ]",
    "however , there are many uncertainties that hinder a direct comparison of these asymmetric drift estimates to the data .",
    "first of all , the overdensities targeted in the outer fields are evidently not equilibrium structures , so the asymmetric drift equation need not hold precisely . apart from the uncertainty in the inclination of the galaxy ,",
    "there are further uncertainties in the projection of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid , as we discussed in  4.1 . a realistic treatment of the asymmetric drift will require data that sample better the extended disk region .      with typical sizes of @xmath239 and",
    "velocity dispersions of @xmath240 , the virial mass associated with the sub - structures we discuss in  5   would have to be of the order of @xmath241 .",
    "however , the total luminosity of these sub - structures is very low , although this is a difficult quantity to measure given the irregular morphology and the difficulty of identifying their spatial limits .",
    "for the case of field f16 , where the structure is well - separated from m31 , the total luminosity is a mere @xmath242 . thus if these structures are bound , they require a ridiculous mass to light ratio of several hundred in solar units .",
    "they are instead most probably unbound structures dissolving in the global potential of the galaxy .",
    "it is informative to estimate the lifetime of the structures if they are indeed unbound . in this case",
    "both the winding due to differential rotation and the velocity dispersion of the structure set a dissolution time - scale . in a potential with a flat rotation curve of velocity @xmath243 , an unbound structure at galactocentric radius @xmath36 becomes smeared out by an extent equal to its initial size in a time @xmath244 , i.e. in @xmath245 at @xmath246 for the case of m31 ( taking @xmath247 ) .",
    "alternatively , if we consider just the effect of the expansion of the stellar population due to its velocity dispersion unconstrained by self - gravity , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath248 , a structure of size @xmath81 will double in size in @xmath249 , fortuitously the same time estimated before .",
    "these simple arguments give an order - of - magnitude estimate of the the survival time of the structures , and strongly suggest that they can not be long - lived .",
    "@xcite present extremely deep photometry with the acs camera for a field on the minor axis of m31 .",
    "the location of this field , indicated in figure  4 with a small square , lies at a projected radius of only @xmath250 .",
    "the corresponding de - projected radius is @xmath251 , beyond the break in the surface density profile of figure  27 .",
    "however , a tiny @xmath252 warp in the extended disk would bring the field into the @xmath253 region . in their data , brown et al .",
    "find evidence for a 30% component of intermediate age stars ( @xmath254@xmath255 ) with metallicity @xmath150   > -0.5}$ ] , though they claim a similar - quality fit for a population of metallicity @xmath149 >   -1.0}$ ] .",
    "given that this is the youngest component in that field , and has comparable metallicity , it is possible that the intermediate - age population whose age they constrain is the extended disk .",
    "however , a definitive measure of the age of the population will require resolving the main - sequence turnoff in fields where we are sure the the extended disk population is present .      how did the extended disk form ?",
    "several possibilities present themselves .    * * formation by the accretion of many small sub - galactic structures .",
    "* this scenario would explain naturally the lumpy sub - structure seen at the edge of the extended disk , as well as the differences in the velocity dispersion and the variations in the old stellar populations between fields .",
    "however , the chemical homogeneity of the material argues against this possibility , since the different accreted galaxies would likely have a range of different metallicities , depending on their mass and star - formation history .",
    "admittedly , the metallicity measurements we present above give only the mean of the population , and in the central regions of m31 , considerable mixing must have taken place .",
    "nevertheless , it is surprising to find the same mean abundance even in the outermost sub - structures .",
    "a further problem with this scenario is the disk - like kinematics .",
    "a substantial mass is required for dynamical friction to affect the orbit of a galaxy satellite ( @xmath256 , @xcite ) which has to become circularized _ before _ being disrupted in order to give rise to a final structure with disk - like kinematics .",
    "another problem is the disk - like distribution of debris . though accretion in the disk plane does appear to be favored @xcite , the accretion of a large number of halo objects is expected to give rise to a distribution closer to that of a spheroidal stellar halo than a disk .",
    "even the thick disk component in the @xcite simulation , in which @xmath257% is formed by accretion , is a very thick component of axis ratios @xmath258 and scale - length of @xmath259 ( our measurements from their figures 1 and 3 ) . forming the extended disk observed in m31 in this way",
    "will certainly be a challenge for modelers .",
    "* * formation from stars accreted in a single large merger . * here we envisage the assimilation of a whole m33-sized galaxy in a single merging event .",
    "accreting 10% of the total mass of a galaxy counts as a significant merger , affecting the morphology of the larger galaxy .",
    "however , given that the bulk of the interaction took place long ago , possibly @xmath254@xmath255 in the past ( corresponding to @xmath260 ) , the progenitor of m31 would have been considerably less massive at that time @xcite , and the resulting interaction would likely be termed a `` major merger '' after which andromeda would have been globally reshaped .",
    "thin disks are easily heated up by mergers @xcite , so this scenario makes a testable prediction that stars in the inner disk of m31 that formed before the merger should have a much larger scale - height than the younger thin disk .",
    "the advantage of this proposition is that it accounts naturally for the uniform mean abundances measured in the different fields .",
    "it is questionable that such a merger could have given rise to a population with disk - like morphology and kinematics , since typical disk galaxy collisions result in elliptical end - products ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , new simulations by @xcite cast doubt on the inevitability of forming elliptical galaxies from such collisions , showing that disk galaxies may form even in equal mass mergers if the progenitors are gas dominated .",
    "further numerical experiments are required to establish whether a disk as extended as the one seen around m31 can be formed in this way . * * formation induced by a single large merger .",
    "* this scenario would be similar to the previous one , but the stellar population of the accreted galaxy would end up populating the bulge or other spheroidal component of m31 .",
    "this is perhaps consistent with the presence of a double nucleus in that galaxy @xcite .",
    "however the interaction itself could have triggered star - formation on a massive scale in the pre - existing gaseous disk of m31 , with gas accreted from the satellite contributing to the enrichment .",
    "this possibility could explain the disk - like structure and kinematics , and has the testable prediction that its constituent stars should be no older than the interaction itself .",
    "the homogeneity in mean abundance over the structure could be explained by star - formation being limited very rapidly before chemical enrichment could take place .",
    "such a rapid formation of the disk in this way is similar to what is deduced for @xmath261 sub - mm sources at @xmath262 with star - formation rates of @xmath263 @xcite . nevertheless , this scenario is also problematic , as it is hard to reconcile with the variations in the velocity dispersion between fields .",
    "a concern with the last two scenarios is that the sub - structures that we see on the outskirts of the extended disk now are short - lived features that will soon disappear ( @xmath264 ) .",
    "this means that we would be observing the system at a special time at the very tail - end of the merging process .",
    "a further problem is the constraint on the size of a past major merger set by the existence of a population of thin disk globular clusters that has recently been discovered in m31 by @xcite .",
    "those authors infer that no more than 10% of the mass of the disk could have been accreted in a single merger since the formation of the clusters .",
    "the time of formation of the clusters is currently poorly constrained , though they find no reason why the clusters should be significantly younger than those of the milky way .",
    "measuring the ages of these objects will help greatly in distinguishing between the above scenarios .",
    "as we noted in  5.4 , if stars become unbound from ngc  205 , we would observe them in field f6 with kinematic properties very close to that of disk material . likewise ,",
    "if @xcite were correct in identifying the arc - like structure to the north of m31 as a tidal stream from ngc  205 , this tidal debris , which is located in fields f8 and f9 , would also have disk - like kinematics .",
    "this raises the possibility that ngc  205 is connected to the extended disk structure , either as the direct supplier of stars , or as the remnant of the ancient structure which created the extended disk .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the mean metallicity of ngc  205 has been measured to be @xmath265    \\sim   -0.9}$ ] @xcite , identical to the mean spectroscopic measurements from the fields presented in this survey .",
    "a counter - argument however , is that recent estimates for the distance to ngc  205 indicate that it is behind m31 , being at a distance of @xmath266 @xcite , compared to @xmath267 for the m31 disk at the location of ngc  205 .",
    "the difference in distance is therefore @xmath268 , little over @xmath148 , although we are probably grossly overestimating the uncertainties , since a differential distance measurement is expected to be much more accurate .",
    "however , this need not rule out the connection with ngc  205 . if the dwarf galaxy were indeed @xmath269 beyond the foreground disk on the near side of m31 , it would be @xmath205 behind m31 , at a location @xmath270 above the plane of the disk on the far side of that galaxy .",
    "@xcite have presented an analysis of the kinematics of 135 planetary nebulae in the disk and inner halo of m31 .",
    "they find the surprising result that a standard model for the thin disk , thick disk and bulge can not reproduce the observed pne kinematics at major axis distances of @xmath1 to @xmath271 . in order not to introduce the presence of an additional component , they invoke occam s razor to alter the parameters of the bulge , deducing that the bulge must rotate rapidly at large distances .",
    "we re - assess their data in the light of the discovery of the additional extended disk population .",
    "figure  29 shows the positions of the 135 pne in their survey .",
    "stars close to the centre of m31 are a complex mix of populations , so we investigate the sub - sample with @xmath272 , which are displayed as filled circles .",
    "the distribution of velocity lags is shown in figure  30 .",
    "we fit this distribution for @xmath273 using a maximum - likelihood algorithm , to account for the velocity measurement uncertainties quoted by @xcite as well as the disk model uncertainties ( from figure  8) .",
    "the resulting gaussian model has @xmath274 and @xmath275 , very similar to the fit in figure  10 .",
    "further analysis is necessary to establish conclusively whether the existence of the extended disk alleviates the need for a rapidly rotating outer bulge as suggested by @xcite .",
    "are indicated with filled circles . ]    . a maximum - likelihood gaussian fit to the data in the interval @xmath276",
    "is also shown , for which both the estimated velocity uncertainties from @xcite as well as the uncertainties in the disk rotation model ( from figure  8) have been taken into account .",
    "we fit a gaussian mean velocity lag of @xmath277 and dispersion @xmath278 ( @xmath279 , @xmath280 ) .",
    "the same low dispersion disk - like population as discovered in our deimos fields is also present here . ]",
    "a population of massive globular clusters has recently been found in the disk of m31 @xcite .",
    "these objects are scattered around the outskirts of the inner disk at distances of @xmath281 , and have very blue colors , with color indices indicating a young age of @xmath282 .",
    "the population is also very significant , accounting for @xmath283% of the globular cluster system of that galaxy .",
    "this population of young clusters rotates rapidly , possessing kinematics similar to that of the disk . a further piece of relevant information is provided by the recent discovery of the globular cluster bologna  514 @xcite , which is situated close to the south - western major axis of m31 at a projected distance of @xmath284 , almost exactly on the outer ellipse marked in figures  1 and 4 .",
    "the rotation model of figure  7 gives a disk - lag velocity of this globular cluster of @xmath285 ( @xmath286 ) .    though it is tempting to speculate on a possible connection between these globular clusters and the extended disk , the metallicities of the clusters appear to be much lower than the @xmath287 = -0.9}$ ] we measure for the structures in this study .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the metallicities of these globular clusters could be higher if they are of younger age than the typical halo cluster .",
    "further observations are needed to establish the age of these m31 disk clusters , and their relation to the extended disk .",
    "several edge - on galaxies have been found to possess a flattened component with a much larger scale - height than the thin disk @xcite probably indicating the presence of a thick disk .",
    "recently , two of the sample of @xcite were observed spectroscopically by @xcite , who found the thick disk to be rotating very slowing in one case and counter - rotating in the other .",
    "this result shows that thick disks can have completely different kinematics from the thin disk , although this is not the case for the milky way .",
    "the fact that the extended disk we find around m31 has a low velocity dispersion , and follows circular orbits closely thus behaving kinematically like a thin disk , as well as having a very similar scale - length to the thin disk , suggests a close link with that component , and argues against association with the thick disk of andromeda .",
    "it should be noted , however , that it has not yet been shown that andromeda does indeed possess a thick disk .",
    "the present dataset may allow us to detect the thick disk , but we will return to this issue in a future contribution .",
    "our group has also been attempting to unravel the formation history of the milky way @xcite , with similar goals to our study of m31 .",
    "following up on the discovery of a peculiar halo structure in the sdss @xcite , we showed that the milky way is enveloped in a ring - like distribution of old stars that lie at galactocentric distances of @xmath288  kpc , well beyond the edge of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "a subsequent analysis of asymmetries in the 2mass survey revealed a strong enhancement of stars at the edge of the galactic disk , which we interpreted as an accreted dwarf galaxy fragment ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) ; a connection with the ring - like structure is possible , though not proven .",
    "however , this `` galactic ring '' or `` galactic anticenter stellar structure '' @xcite is not the only stellar population with disk - like kinematics that lies beyond the rim of the milky way thin - disk : recently @xcite and @xcite have uncovered a further stellar structure located at a distance of @xmath289  kpc and which spans a huge angle on the sky .",
    "these findings indicate that the outer regions of the galactic plane have a similar messy flattened structure to what is observed in m31 ( figure  1 ) .    a possible young counterpart to the `` extended disks '' in the milky way and",
    "m31 has been seen in some more distant galaxies .",
    "galex observations of m83 @xcite have revealed an extended population of uv sources ( ob stars ) beyond the inner disk ( though at much smaller radius than the structure we detect in m31 ) , while several galaxies are known to exhibit regions to extremely large radii @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that there may exist an additional component to spiral galaxies , a putative `` extended - disk '' .",
    "the implications for galaxy formation are profound : the inhomogenous spatial distribution and moderately high metallicity suggests an origin in multiple accretions , yet accreted fragments , which are the building blocks of galaxies , do not give rise to these huge extended disks in current simulations .",
    "we have presented an analysis of a large survey of the andromeda galaxy with the keck / deimos spectrograph based on targets selected from a panoramic survey with the int wide field camera .",
    "a huge rotating structure that follows an exponential density law with scale - length @xmath290 is detected out to a de - projected distance of @xmath2 , with sub - structures continuing out even further in radius .",
    "all of the photometric sub - structures that were targeted for spectroscopic follow - up participate in the same disk - like movement .",
    "the velocity dispersion is low , typically @xmath236 .",
    "these properties indicate that the population is a huge extended stellar disk .",
    "the color dispersion on the rgb of stars that belong to this structure is broad , implying that a wide metallicity range is present .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the mean metallicity give @xmath150 = -0.9 \\pm 0.2}$ ] .",
    "no significant radial trend in either kinematics or metallicity is found , although deep acs photometry in several of the deimos fields reveals variations in the horizontal branch morphology over the galaxy , indicating that the stellar population of the most ancient stars differ between fields .",
    "we estimate that @xmath291% of the luminous mass of the andromeda disk resides in this extended disk component , beyond the @xmath217 scale - length cutoff observed in most galaxies .",
    "however , this region may account for @xmath8% of the total angular momentum of the galaxy .",
    "the spatial sub - structures that form the outer edge of this system are almost certainly no longer gravitationally bound and will disappear as spatially coherent entities within @xmath292 .",
    "however , the existence of these sub - structures indicates a formation mechanism by mergers , and implies that the extended disk is still forming , although we seem to be observing it at the very tail end of its formation period .",
    "it is unclear at this point whether the extended disk was formed by multiple accretion events or by a single large event , though the latter possibility appears more plausible given the present data .",
    "many questions remain to be answered .",
    "is the extended disk a continuation of the thin disk , or is it a separate component ? was the merger , or were the mergers , that formed the extended disk responsible for the formation of the @xmath18-law halo of andromeda ?",
    "why is the extended disk closely aligned with the thin disk ?",
    "why is it not extremely warped ?",
    "the surface brightness of this structure , 27 - 31  mag / arcsec@xmath293 in its outer regions , places it beyond what would be classified as `` disk '' in more distant systems .",
    "though such faint surface brightness levels are extremely challenging to observe , by resolving individual stars it will be possible to ascertain whether the extended disk is a particularity of m31 or whether similar components are present in other galaxies .",
    "further work is also needed in the milky way to study the distant stellar populations hidden by foreground populations in the galactic plane , and to understand the nature of the structures recently unveiled at the edge of the galactic disk and beyond @xcite , and their relation to the vast extended disk in the andromeda galaxy .",
