    "the basic motivation behind a quantum cosmological model is two - fold .",
    "one is the fact that when the linear dimension of the universe reaches the planck scale ( @xmath0 cm ) , the universe is indeed governed by a quantum picture .",
    "the second is the hope that a quantum description might be able to produce a singularity free birth of our universe .",
    "the quantum state of the universe is described by a wave function @xmath1 which is the solution of the wheeler dewitt equation on a minisuperspace . for a comprehensive review",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "+    one critical problem in quantum cosmology is certainly that of a suitable choice of time against which the evolution of the universe is investigated .",
    "this is because the notion of time has different implications in general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "systematic attempts towards resolving this problem started in the 90s@xcite .",
    "the strategies also include a scenario where the notion of time plays no role whatsoever@xcite .",
    "for a recent review of different strategies , see @xcite .",
    "+    if matter is taken as a perfect fluid , the strategy adopted by schutz@xcite becomes extremely useful as a set of canonical transformations leads to one conjugate momentum associated with the fluid giving a linear contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding fluid variable thus qualifies to play the role of time in the relevant schr@xmath2dinger equation . in an ever expanding model",
    ", the fluid density has a monotonic temporal behaviour , the time orientability is thus ensured .",
    "+    schutz s formalism has been extensively used by alvarenga _",
    "et al_@xcite for isotropic cosmological models .",
    "the investigation involves spatially flat , open and closed models .",
    "matter content is taken as a perfect fluid with an equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "they found finite norm wave packet solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equations .",
    "one important finding is that some singularity free models could be constructed even without violating the energy conditions .",
    "a later work involves anisotropic bianchi",
    "i cosmology@xcite , which is the anisotropic generalization of a spatially flat isotropic model .",
    "anisotropic models have problems , particularly that of non - unitarity .",
    "the hamiltonian , although hermitian , is not self - adjoint .",
    "this is discussed in some detail in ref@xcite . +    it is well known that a standard copenhagen interpretation of a quantum cosmological model is not tenable .",
    "a `` bohm - de broglie '' interpretation normally does better . for a comprehensive review ,",
    "we refer to @xcite . in the anisotropic case",
    ", the non unitarity leads to futher problems in the interpretation . as the norm of the wave function becomes time dependent , bohmian trajectories",
    "are not conserved and the bohm - de broglie interpretation also becomes vulnerable@xcite .",
    "it appears that the philosophy of interpretation might require a dramatic extension so as to incorporate anisotropic cosmologies .    in the present work schutz s formalism",
    "is utilized to quantize bianchi type v and type ix perfect fluid cosmological models which are the anisotropic generalzations of open and closed isotropic models respectively . in section 2",
    "we discuss the formalism and use that to quantize bianchi type v models . in section 3 , a type ix model is quantized .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in section 4 .",
    "the relevant action for gravity with a perfect fluid can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the induced metric over three dimensional spatial hypersurface which is the boundary @xmath6 of the four dimensional manifold @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the extrinsic curvature . here",
    "units are so chosen that @xmath9 is equal to one .",
    "@xmath10 is the pressure due to the perfect fluid .",
    "the perfect fluid satisfies an equation of state @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "this restriction stems from the consideration that sound waves can not propagate faster than light . in schutz s formalism @xcite",
    "the fluid s four velocity can be expressed in terms of six potentials .",
    "however , two of them are connected with rotation . in bianchi",
    "v or ix models permit timelike geodesics which are hypersurface orthogonal , the rotation tensor @xmath13 vanishes , and one can write the four velocity in terms of only four independent potentials as @xmath14 here @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the velocity potentials having their own evolution equations , where the potentials connected with vorticity are dropped .",
    "the four velocity is normalized as @xmath19 although the physical identification of velocity potentials are irrelevant for the formulation , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be identified with the specific enthalpy and specific entropy respectively .",
    "this identification facilitates the representation of fluid parameters in terms of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the metric for the bianchi v anisotropic model is written as @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is called the lapse function . while @xmath22 are functions of the cosmic time @xmath23 , @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "bianchi type i model is recovered when @xmath25 . eliminating the surface terms",
    ", the first and second terms of the action ( 1 ) give @xmath26 \\ , , \\ ] ] where an overhead dot indicates a differentiation with respect to time @xmath23 and @xmath27 is contribution of geometry to the action .",
    "so the gravitational lagrangian density can be easily identified as @xmath28 if we now choose the three metric coefficients as @xmath29 then we get @xmath30 and @xmath31 - 6e^{\\beta_0}nm^2 \\ ,   .\\ ] ] now @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be treated as the relevant variables in place of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "for the fluid part , the action can be written using thermodynamic relations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the relevant equations are @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are temperature , total mass energy density , rest mass density and specific internal energy respectively . rewriting the third equation of ( [ thermo ] )",
    "we get @xmath47 \\quad .\\ ] ] it then follows that , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . we can show that the equation of state takes the form @xmath50 in a comoving system @xmath51 , and equation ( [ nor ] ) yields @xmath52 \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath53 being the fluid part of the action .",
    "as @xmath54 so @xmath55 . if we try the canonical methods used , for example , in @xcite the hamiltonian for this action can be written in a very simple form with the canonical transformations @xmath56 along with @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the lagrangian density of the fluid , is the expression inside the square bracket of equation ( [ af ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for this perfect fluid can now be written as @xmath61 the advantage of using this method , i.e. , using canonical transformations , is that we could find a set of variables where the system of equations is more tractable , while the hamiltonian structure of the system remains intact .",
    "it also deserves mention that amongst the four velocty potentials mentioned , actually two are used , namely @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is because @xmath17 and @xmath15 are related by @xmath62 ( see ref@xcite ) and one other , namely @xmath18 can be settled using the normalization ( [ nor ] ) .",
    "the super hamiltonian for the minisuperspace of this anisotropic quantum model is @xmath63 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath64 acts as a lagrange multiplier taking care of the classical constraint equation @xmath65 .",
    "using the usual quantization procedure @xcite , we write the schr@xmath2dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation for our super hamiltonian with the ansatz that the super hamiltonian operator annihilates the wave function , @xmath66 there are attempts@xcite to show that the classical hamiltonian for a cosmological spacetime is zero , if one takes into account both the matter sector and the geometry sector together , like the present situation . but",
    "these attempts involves pseudotensorial calculations and the result depends on the minisuperspace chosen@xcite .",
    "the problem perhaps stems from the fact that localization of energy in general relativity is not uniquely defined . whatever be the status of the constraint ( [ wdwe1 ] ) in the most general case",
    ", we shall be using this following the standard practice .",
    "+ with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 equation ( [ wdwe1 ] ) can now be written as @xmath70\\ , \\psi(\\beta_0,\\beta_+,t ) = 0 \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath71 is the cosmic time co - ordinate if we choose the gauge @xmath72 and this follows from hamilton s classical equations as @xmath73 .",
    "now it must be mentioned that while constructing the schr@xmath2dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdwe ] ) we have considered a particular choice of factor ordering for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we will discuss other choices of factor orderings and its consequences on our prime results in the subsequent section .",
    "we require that the super hamiltonian must be hermitian , so the wave function @xmath1 must satisfy these conditions @xcite ; @xmath76 in order to solve for the wave function @xmath1 from equation ( [ wdwe ] ) we employ a separation of variables as , @xmath77 we get @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the separation constant .",
    "further if we write @xmath80 we get @xmath81 the solution for @xmath82 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the integration constant and @xmath85 is again a constant of separation which has to be real so that the wave function is normalizable .",
    "the equation for @xmath86 is @xmath87 for @xmath25 , this equation reduces to the corresponding equation for the bianchi i model @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to solve this equation analytically for all allowed values of @xmath88 . here",
    "we will study the solution for some particular values of @xmath88 .      with @xmath90 equation ( [ vs1 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath91 the solution of equation ( [ phi1 ] ) is known in terms of bessel function and now we can write the wave function of equation ( [ wdwe ] ) as @xcite @xmath92 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , @xmath94 are the integration constants .",
    "now we can construct a regular wave packet superposing these solutions . in principle",
    "this can be easily done by considering the arbitrary integration constants to be suitable gaussian functions of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath79 ( see ref @xcite ) .",
    "defining @xmath95 we can write the form of the wave packet as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are arbitrary positive constants .",
    "the above integrals can be explicitly evaluated and the wave packet becomes @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "the norm of the wave packet is @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "clearly we can see that the norm is time dependent and hence the model is not unitary .",
    "this is not surprising as we know that the anisotropic quantum cosmological models are non - unitary @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of any variable @xmath104 can now be calculated as @xmath105 for @xmath106 we find @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a numerical factor @xmath110 .",
    "now @xmath111 this describes the cosmological evolution of the spatial volume and this model predicts a bounce from a minimum volume universe with no singularity .",
    "of course this result is facilitated by the choice of the gauge @xmath112 as mentioned after equation(21 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimum volume is obtained at @xmath113 and the corresponding length scale is @xmath114 . as already mentioned , @xmath115 .",
    "so the linear size of the universe can be set in the model by choosing the vaule of @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath116 , @xmath117 it deserves mention that @xmath33 is in fact a constant in time .",
    "the plot of the norm of the wave packet against @xmath32 and @xmath33 shows a well behaved pattern , and even at @xmath113 , does not show any sign of blowing up ( see figure [ [ fig3 ] ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there exists a minimum of the proper volume and thus the pathology of a singular state of the universe can be avoided in this model .",
    "furthermore , the plots are given for two different time , namely @xmath113 and @xmath118 in some units , and the qualitative nature of the plots remain similar .",
    "now let us have a closer look at equation ( [ wnorm ] ) . as @xmath119",
    "so we infer that the norm of the wave packet is time - dependent hence the model is non - unitary .",
    "we now investigate the time dependence of the norm ( @xmath120 ) as a function of time ( @xmath121 ) in figure [ [ norm1 ] ] .",
    "it is observed that with the increase of @xmath121 , the norm flattens , i.e. , almost becomes a constant .",
    "this indicates that the problem of non - unitarity is somewhat diluted at least for a large time .",
    "it deserves mention that this feature may be facilitated by our choice of gauge @xmath122 which makes @xmath123 a constant .

    "the expression for the wave function can be written as @xmath139 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "the hamiltonian for this gravitational lagrangian density becomes @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the canonical conjugate momenta for the variables @xmath35 and @xmath146 . applying schutz s mechanism @xcite and the canonical methods described in @xcite we can evaluate the hamiltonian for the fluid as @xmath147 the super hamiltonian for the minisuperspace of this model is @xmath148 we shall calculate the wave function of the bianchi ix universe with @xmath149 .",
    "using the quantization procedure as described in @xcite we write the schr@xmath2dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation as @xmath150 now we have to apply the method of separation of variables for the solution of this equation .",
    "we write the wave function as @xmath151 which leads to @xmath152 with the separation @xmath153 we get @xmath154 and @xmath155 here @xmath85 is the separation parameter",

    "@xmath162 s are the arbitrary integration constants .",

    "bianchi type v and type ix perfect fluid models are quantized following schutz s formalism . as the wheeler - dewitt equation for a general equation of state @xmath3 is too involved ,",
    "some specific examples are taken up . in bianchi type",
    "v models , the solution for the wave function for the universe comes out as a combination of bessel functions for the case @xmath164 . but it deserves mention that the problem of non - unitarity exists in this model , the norm of the wave packet is indeed time dependent .",
    "a clever operator ordering can only alleviate the problem in the sense that the norm becomes a constant for a large time .",
    "but the problem is only alleviated and not eradicated ! in addition to the operator ordering , the choice of a gauge as @xmath122 also may have its say .",
    "the proper volume shows a bounce from a finite minimum and thus the singularity of a zero proper volume can be avoided . by a choice of parameter",
    ", the minimum length scale obtained can be tuned to a desired value , say the planck length .",
    "however , this is obtained as a bonus , as the chief motivation of the work had been to check the merits and problems of the particular method of quantization for the anisotropic cosmological models .    only one case ,",
    "namely @xmath164 has been solved here as an example .",
    "this is simply because this case could be integrated anayltically .",
    "for some other cases also the wave functions are obtained analytically .",
    "but the complete analysis could not be done as the wave packet could not be integrated .",
    "so the work is nowhere near a general investigation of the problem .",
    "however , so long there is not a complete resolution of the quantum cosmology , one has to look for various examples .",
    "so although potentially schutz formalism gives us a beautiful way of handling the problem of the choice of time , it also leads to other problems , namely that of non unitatiry .",
    "this could be a generic feature of anisotropic models as indicated in @xcite .",
    "the philosophy of interpretation also seems to be awaiting a new direction .",
