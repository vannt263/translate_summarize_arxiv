    "the interacting stellar winds model , initially proposed by @xcite , is now the widely accepted scenario to explain planetary nebula ( pn ) formation .",
    "however , it has not yet been unequivocally determined what is the ultimate mechanism responsible for the collimation of the subclass of pne that show bipolar or highly collimated morphologies ( e.g. ) . in the context of the interacting stellar winds model",
    ", the formation of a bipolar pn requires a collimation mechanism . an isotropic fast wind interacting with an aspherical mass loss structure formed during the top of asymptotic giant branch ( agb )",
    "phase is the most commonly invoked scenario , although a collimated fast wind and a spherical agb structure has also been considered @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that models are able to reproduce a wide variety of observed morphologies , it is still not clear how the aspherical mass - loss during the agb ( or the axisymmetric fast wind ) is produced .    from the numerical standpoint , several variations and additions to the interacting stellar wind model",
    "have been developed extensively in the literature under the name of generalized interacting stellar winds ( gisw ) model . in the gisw model ,",
    "a fast , tenuous wind from the central star expands into a slow , dense wind whose geometry is assumed to be toroidal .",
    "magnetic fields have also been considered in numerical models ; the magnetized wind blown bubble model ( mwbb ) produces an aspherical mass distribution by including toroidal magnetic fields that constrain the outflow and produce jets in the polar direction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the precession of an episodic jet has been used to reproduce point - symmetric morphologies @xcite .",
    "variations to the magnetic approach to generate the agb aspherical density structure include using a stellar companion rapidly rotating around the central star @xcite .",
    "although models accurately replicate the pne shapes , the ultimate question still remains : whether the magnetic field , and/or the stellar rotation , required to develop an aspherical agb mass - loss can be sustained by a single star or if they require the presence of a binary companion @xcite .    in order to distinguish between the physical processes that may play a role in the process of shaping pne , it is important to have a detailed morphological classification scheme that includes the basic morphological features , and also allows for more detailed subclasses ( e.g. the presence of multiple shell pne , multipolar axis ) within each group @xcite .",
    "we should proceed further in the classification and explore the degree of collimation observed in bipolar objects , as this most likely reflects the type(s ) and strength(s ) of the physical process(es ) involved .",
    "finally , the kinematics of the nebula allows us to recover its 3-d structure , as it gives access to the extra - dimension hidden in direct imaging .    in this paper , we present high resolution echelle long - slit spectroscopy of a sample of 9 pne from the @xcite catalog that show highly axisymmetric morphologies with different degrees of collimation .",
    "seven of the pne in our sample are classified as bipolar ( k3 - 46 , k3 - 58 , hen2 - 428 , hen2 - 437 , m2 - 48 , m3 - 55 , and wesb4 ) , and the other two ( m1 - 75 and m4 - 14 ) present quadrupolar morphologies that are characterized by two pairs of bipolar lobes symmetric with respect to two different axes .",
    "two objects in the sample , k3 - 58 and m4 - 14 , show also point symmetric features . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and data reduction , in  3 we outline the procedure used in the analysis of the data , and in  4 we present the results of the kinematical fits performed to the objects in our sample .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in  5 and the conclusions summarized in  6 .",
    "the images are from `` the iac morphological catalog of northern galactic planetary nebulae '' @xcite .",
    "the long - slit echelle spectra were obtained in july 1995 and august 1996 at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) using the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) . a tektronix ccd detector 1024@xmath11024 pixels , with a spatial scale of 036  pixel@xmath2 was used .",
    "the 79 line mm@xmath2 echelle was centered on the emission line , covering the spectral range from 6530 to 6600  with a dispersion of 0.07   pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the slit width was set to 11 , providing a spectral resolution of 0.14  which corresponds to 6.5 .",
    "the unvignetted field of view is up to 160  long .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf tasks for two - dimensional spectra .",
    "the images were corrected for differential illumination of the slit using sky flat fields obtained with the same configuration .",
    "the wavelength scale and geometrical distortion were set by a two - dimensional fit to a th - ar calibration lamp .",
    "the wavelength calibration has an accuracy better than 0.004  ( 0.2 ) .",
    "the sky emission , which includes the geocoronal line , was removed by fitting and subtracting the background using a low order polynomial function .",
    "the observing log is summarized in table  [ observations ] were the common pn name is given in column ( 1 ) , the pn  g number in column ( 2 ) , the date of the observations in column ( 3 ) , the slit position angle ( p.a . ) in column ( 4 ) , and the exposure time in column ( 5 ) .",
    "the slit positions go through the center of the nebulae , and their p.a .",
    "have been chosen to cut across their main symmetry axis . in most cases ,",
    "spectra were obtained at two slit positions along perpendicular directions .",
    "bipolar pne have typically hourglass or butterfly morphology , meaning that they show two bipolar lobes connected by a narrow waist .",
    "the exact geometry can be very different from one bipolar pn to another .",
    "these differences can basically be described by the aspect ratio of the bipolar lobes and by the relative width of the waist with respect to these bipolar lobes .",
    "in addition , the inclination with respect to the plane of the sky affects the apparent morphology , while the nebular kinematics determines the observed expansion velocity . in order to determine the 3d geometry and kinematics of the bipolar pne in our sample ,",
    "we have used the empirical model of which was originally developed to interpret the velocity field of the bipolar nebula around the symbiotic star r  aquarii . in this model , hereafter referred to as the solf & ulrich s model , the velocity distribution along a plane going through the main nebular symmetry axis is described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the latitudinal angle from the symmetry axis of the nebula , @xmath5 is the equatorial velocity , the minimum velocity along the nebular waist , @xmath6 is the polar velocity , the maximum velocity of the farthest point from the center of the nebula , and @xmath7 is a geometrical factor that defines the hourglass geometry , with @xmath8 for round , bubble - like bipolar lobes , and @xmath9 for very elongated bipolar lobes .",
    "one advantage of the solf & ulrich s model is the possibility to fit simultaneously images and spectra of a given nebula in order to recover the 3d geometry lost by projection effects . as an illustration",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4inc.ps ] simulated images and position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams of a nebula obtained using eq .  [ solf ] for three different inclination angles with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig4inc.ps ] , it is clear that the tilt of the simulated line strongly depends on the inclination angle of the object .",
    "therefore , the shape of the pv diagram can be used to derive the inclination angle which may only be assessed from the aspect ratio of the central ring under the strong assumption that it is circular . similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig3gamma.ps ] shows simulated images and pv diagrams for nebulae with different @xmath7 factors . in this case",
    ", we see that as @xmath7 increases , the shape of the pv diagram becomes narrower and the line tilt more apparent .",
    "[ fig3gamma.ps ] also shows that it is not possible to determine the inclination angle of the nebula from the projected shape of its cylindrical narrow waist for @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is readily seen that we can determine the inclination from the line tilt in the pv diagram .",
    "the fitting procedure is an iterative process that is started by modeling simulated images and pv diagrams with parameters that are first order estimates .",
    "the set of free parameters includes the polar and equatorial velocities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the 1 kpc kinematical age , the inclination angle of the pn with respect to the plane of sky , the @xmath7-factor describing the shape of the nebula , and the radial velocity .    for the objects with a clearly visible central ring structure",
    ", we can estimate both the equatorial expansion velocity and the radial velocity just by measuring the velocity of the two brightness maxima at the opposite sides of the ring ; the average of the two velocities gives us the radial velocity , while the half difference of the velocities give us a lower limit of the equatorial expansion velocity . in this case , we can even assess the inclination of the nebula as the axis ratio of the equatorial ring is a direct measurement of the inclination angle if we assume that the ring is circular .",
    "then , the synthetic nebular image and pv diagram are plotted over the h@xmath4 or h@xmath4+[n  ii ] image and [ n  ii ] spectra emission line because of its relative brightness and small thermal broadening .",
    "] , respectively .",
    "the initial estimates of the parameters are changed until we reach an optimum fit when the synthetic pv diagram passes through the intensity maxima in the spectral data and the simulated image traces tightly the nebular geometry .",
    "we note that the geometry of the nebula can be reproduced with different sets of values for the free parameters .",
    "however , the degeneracy is broken by fitting the geometry of the object together with the spectral line shape .",
    "the accuracy of this iterative process is hard to quantify and it has to be determined for each object individually .    the parameters of the best fits are listed in table  2 and figs .",

    "[ double1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the spectrum taken along p.a .",
    "77  is off - center and passes through the bright knots in the equatorial ring .",
    "therefore , the basic spectral fitting relies on the spectrum at p.a.=157  which has adequate signal - to - noise ratio in the central region and the brightest northern lobe to constrain the fit . from our best fit",
    ", we get an equatorial expansion velocity , @xmath12 , of 16 , and a polar velocity , @xmath11 , of 80 . a value of @xmath12=15  was obtained for this object by .",
    "* hen2 - 437 * + hen2 - 437 ( see fig.[double2 ] [ top ] ) is a very elongated pn that does not show a central ring structure .",
    "these morphological features make very difficult to constrain its equatorial velocity and to reproduce the spectral shape with the solf & ulrich s model . since there is almost no tilt in the central maxima of the [ n  ii ] echellogram along pa  77 , we assume that the nebula has a small inclination angle , lying almost in the plane of the sky",
    ".    the geometry of the nebula is thus constrained by its morphology , and the nebular contours can be reproduced relatively well by using an extremely high @xmath7 factor . given the difficulties in reproducing the spectral shape of hen2 - 437 , it was not possible to derive firm results .",
    "we give a set of the most likely values : the inclination angle is small , within 2 , the polar velocity can be constrained to be between 50 and 100 , and the equatorial velocity has to be small , of the order or lower than 10 .",

    "* k3 - 58 * + at a first glance , k3 - 58 shows a classical bipolar morphology ( fig.[double3 ] ) , but its conspicuous ring is rather irregular and the bipolar lobes show point - symmetry .",

    "90 , with the brightest emission peaks located on the equatorial ring . inside the main lobes , a secondary structure reaches approximately up to one half of the length of the main lobes .",
    "this secondary structure , that is clearly present in the spectral data as bright emission peaks , may have originated from a later ejection to the one that shaped the main lobes . from the fit we obtain @xmath11=38  and @xmath12=12 .",

    "the nebula does not show a circular equatorial ring , but an irregular annular structure at the central regions .",
    "since the equatorial ring is clearly not circular , it can not be used to assess the inclination angle of the nebula with respect to the plane of the sky .",

    "finally , the third group is formed by the somewhat deteriorated objects with poorly defined morphologies ; m1 - 75 and wesb4 .",
    "the pne belonging to this third group are expected to be more evolved since they have the highest kinematical ages . although k3 - 46 also has a large kinematical age , we did not include it in this group of evolved objects .",
    "we suspect that its large kinematical age is probably a consequence of deceleration in the course of its evolution .",
    "our spatio - kinematical study provides a direct estimate of the kinematical age that can be used to assess the nebular age .",
    "it is important to keep in mind in this comparison the very likely possibility of acceleration or deceleration of the nebular material due to the complex interaction between the ionization and dynamics of the shell driven by the hot bubble . as a result , kinematical ages",
    "often do not match the age of the central stars , as shown theoretically by @xcite , who proved that kinematical ages overestimate the age in young nebulae and underestimate it for evolved ones .",
    "moreover , the definition of pn age is a rather tricky concept .",
    "it can be considered that a pn is born when the central star supplies enough photons capable of ionizing the nebula . however , the kinematical age is a dynamical concept that tell us when the gas started moving . at the time of nebular ionization the gas is already moving and the fotoionization itself",
    "is expected to change the gas dynamics .",
    "in addition , the gas velocity as inferred from models @xcite is not constant .",
    "if the gas has been accelerated the kinematical ages are underestimated and the opposite is true if the gas has suffered deceleration . the age obtained in table  2 is one of the parameters of the fitting and it is obtained under very simplistic assumptions , namely that the lobes and the waist were formed at the same time and they have been moving at a constant velocity since then . therefore , the ages determined this way are just an order of magnitude approximation to the time since the formation of the nebula ( both dynamically and from ionization ) .",
    "the kinematical model assumes the same age for the lobes and the waist of a nebula . as a consequence",
    "the larger lobes always have larger expansion velocities .",
    "note that under this simplistic assumption we are excluding the possibility that the lobes were formed before the waist .",
    "we provide in table  [ results ] the 1  kpc kinematical ages . here , we have estimated the `` real '' ages by multiplying the 1  kpc kinematical ages derived from our fits by the individual distances .",
    "it is well known that pne distances are poorly determined , however they are a necessary parameter for the age estimation .",
    "it is important to note that the ages determined in table  3 are the ones given in table  2 but scaled to the distance to the nebula .",
    "we have used the distances obtained from the galactic rotation curves of burton ( 1974 ) when possible , as these distances are considered to be the most reliable . in some cases ,",
    "our data was out of the range covered by the rotational curves , and therefore the distance estimate was not viable through this method .",
    "this also applies for m2 - 48 , for which this method gives ambiguous results , and for m1 - 75 , for which the distance derived from this method ( 5.4 kpc ) is unreasonable and gives a too long kinematic age for a pn .",
    "when it was not possible to estimate the distance from the rotational curves , we have used the statistical distances from cahn et al ( 1991 ) when available .",
    "otherwise we have used the distance from @xcite or , as a last resort , an average of available distances in the literature .",
    "we note that the values given by are systematically lower than the values given by others .",
    "therefore , maciel s distances have not been used for the averages .    in table",

    "m1 - 75 and especially wesb4 are older , with kinematical ages @xmath2110,000 yr , and their morphologies are not sharp .    in old objects such as wesb 4 , ionization - driven instabilities which act on",
    "a timescale comparable to the kinematical age of the nebula might be responsible for the development of irregular shapes @xcite .",

    "k3 - 46 , the oldest pn in our sample ( @xmath2120,000 yr ) , and k3 - 58 , a relatively old pn , have sharp morphologies .",
    "one possibility is that the distances used are wrong , which would not be a surprise given the high uncertainties involved in pn distance determinations .",
    "another possibility for k3 - 46 is that it has experienced deceleration , in which case the age given in the table  3 would be an underestimation of the real age of the object .    adopting a distance of 1kpc to hen 2 - 437",
    ", this is the youngest pn in our sample , with a kinematical age between 750 and 2000yr .",
    "this age is consistent with those of high collimated pne @xcite .",
    "quite often the comparison between theoretical models and observed objects is based only on a morphological match since this the only available information in most cases . from our experience in matching published models to data ,",
    "we have found that it is possible to find models that can simulate the morphology of a pn but with velocities different to those measured ; in this case we need to know whether the model can simultaneously reproduce the morphology and kinematical properties that , in the case of bipolar pne , are parameterized by the expansion velocity , the physical nebular size , and geometry ( the @xmath7 factor ) .",
    "note that , in the model of solf & ulrich , the expansion of a bipolar pn is homologous , i.e. , in its expansion , the nebula keeps its proportions , as well as the ratio between the polar and equatorial velocities .",
    "only the models by @xcite and @xcite provide enough information on the evolution of the morphology for different collimation parameters for us to compare to our data . in the @xcite models ( hereafter , gs99 ) ,",
    "the velocity ratio between the equator and the poles depends on the shaping mechanism , while the absolute values of the velocities depend on the initial velocity of the slow wind . therefore , when evaluating the ability of the theoretical models to match our observations , we are more interested in comparing the nebular shapes and velocity ratios rather than the absolute velocity values .    to compare the models with the observations , we need a parameter that can quantify the degree of collimation .",
    "the @xmath7 factor in the solf & ulrich geometrical model is an appropriate parameter to account for the degree of collimation observed .",
    "the shape in the gs99 models is controled using different values of @xmath20 ( the ratio of the magnetic to the kinetic energy density in the fast wind ) and @xmath22 ( ratio of the stellar rotational velocity to the critical breakup velocity ) .    in order to allow a better comparison between the models and the parameters derived from the observations we have determined the solf & ulrich s parameters ( @xmath7 factor ) that correspong to the gs99 simulated cases .",
    "we find that low @xmath20 and @xmath22 values produce shapes that are similar to those generated by low values of @xmath7 ( @xmath23 ) ( see fig .  5 in gs99 ) .",
    "the gs99 cases with low @xmath20 and high @xmath22 values are equivalent to medium @xmath7 values , while high @xmath20 and high @xmath22 values result in very collimated objects , with high @xmath7 values .    for categories",
    "j  k in gs99 , the morphology develops using only rapid star rotation rates , while for categories q  v the additional help of magnetic fields is required .",
    "hen2 - 428 , k3 - 46 , and m3 - 55 , which have the lowest @xmath7 ( 1 , 0.9 , 0.6 , respectively ) factors in our group , compare well to the categories j  k of gs99 .",
    "both the observed objects and the corresponding theoretical simulations are reproduced with @xmath7 factors around 1 and , although our pne do not have the same absolute expansion velocities as the gs99 cases , this is not a critical issue as lower expansion velocities in gs99 magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations could be obtained by choosing lower initial velocities for the slow wind .",
    "in fact , the ratio of expansion velocities for k3 - 46 and hen2 - 428 situates them in categories q ",
    "r , but their @xmath7 factor and morphology place them into the j ",
    "it must be noticed that the central star of hen2 - 428 is in a binary system ( rodrguez et al .",
    "it is tantalizing to consider that the presence of the binary companion may have influenced the nebular shaping , resulting in a bipolar pn with enhanced polar velocities with respect to the bipolar pn that would have been collimated by a single , rotating star .    in general , the expansion velocities in gs99",
    "are rather high compared to those observed in our sample .",
    "however , m1 - 75 , m4 - 14 , and wesb4 have similar expansion velocity ratios ( i.e. equatorial to polar expansion velocity ) and morphologies as the pne in categories q  r in gs99 .",
    "these 3 pne have @xmath7 factors between 5 and 6 .",
    "in fact , m4 - 14 even coincides in its kinematical age and value of its expansion velocities with the example given by gs99 .",
    "m2 - 48 is more collimated than the previous objects and fits categories s ",
    "t , while hen2 - 437 would go even higher , to the class u in gs99 .",
    "such highly collimated objects , with lobes of wedge - shaped polar regions , are not well reproduced by the solf & ulrich s model and therefore our derived velocities carry a large uncertainty",
    ".    careful inspection of the images of m 2 - 48 and hen 2 - 437 , which have the highest collimation factors in our sample , reveals traces of a dusty disk in the equatorial region , a feature not visible in the low-@xmath7 objects .",
    "similar features were already detected in various young , highly collimated objects ( e.g. @xcite ) and suggest the existence of thick equatorial disks .    finally , we are left with k3 - 58 a rather peculiar object since it has an expansion ratio and @xmath7 factor that lie outside of the cases modeled by gs99 .",
    "k3 - 58 presents a cylindrical equatorial ring which is wider than the one obtained for the j  l categories of gs99 , and it shows lobes that are rounder than those in the r  v classes .",
    "the best fit to the morphology and kinematics of this object can be found in fig.5 of @xcite .",
    "the nebula simulated there has almost identical expansion velocities to those we measure . in this model ,",
    "the point - symmetric shape is accomplished with a tilt between the magnetic collimation axis and the bipolar wind outflow .    to summarize",
    ", we find that objects with low @xmath7 values generally compare well to the gs99 models which are mainly shaped by stellar rotation .",
    "the possible exceptions are pne formed in binary systems that will present low @xmath7 but somewhat higher expansion velocities ( hen2 - 428 ) , while high @xmath7 objects show high polar expansions and agree well with the simulations obtained using strong magnetic fields and high rotational velocities .",
    "although all of our objects are bipolar / quadrupolar , they differ significantly in their morphology and kinematics . morphologies range from bubble - lobed ( hen2 - 428 ) to highly collimated ( hen2 - 437 ) pne .",
    "the sharpness of the nebular shapes also varies from well defined objects to these with somewhat deteriorated shapes ( wesb4 ) .",
    "this variety is reflected in the range of geometrical @xmath7 factors ( from 0.6 to 20 ) which might differentiate between the physical processes that originate them .",
    "we find that the objects from our sample present as well a variety of expansion velocities , from low ( 3 ) to medium ( 16 ) equatorial expansions , and from low ( 18 ) to medium / high ( 100 ) polar expansion velocities .",
    "the disagreement between the spectral data of k3 - 46 , hardly revealing signs of equatorial expansion , and its image , showing a wide central ring indicate the possibility of deceleration in this nebula .",
    "this deceleration may reveal the interaction of the nebular material with a dense equatorial disk .",
    "the estimates of kinematical ages , derived using distances inferred from the galactic rotation curve or otherwise statistical distances , vary from middle age to old with possible significant errors originated from distance errors and non - uniform expansions .",
    "the data agree rather well with the state - of - the - art theory for pn collimation , however , we can not exclude the origin of the possible shaping mechanisms i.e. whether rapid star rotation , and/or magnetic fields are originated by single or binary systems .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath7 factor used to fit the solf & ulrich s model could roughly indicate which shaping process is actually at work .",
