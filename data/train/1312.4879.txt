    "the dirac equation on the 2-sphere and coupled to a dirac monopole provides one of the simplest illustrations of an index theorem @xcite . for a monopole of magnetic charge @xmath1 and a spinor of electric charge @xmath2",
    ", the product of electric and magnetic charge is an integer multiple of planck s constant by dirac s quantisation condition , i.e. , [ dirac ] = n. in mathematical terms , coupling to a dirac monopole amounts to twisting the dirac operator on the 2-sphere by a complex line bundle with connection .",
    "the integer @xmath3 is the chern number of that line bundle and the index of the twisted dirac operator turns out to be @xmath3 , too .",
    "together with a vanishing theorem , this gives the dimension of the space of zero modes as @xmath4 , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for recent treatments and reviews . in physical terms",
    ", there is therefore one state per cell of volume @xmath5 in the electric - magnetic charge plane .",
    "the index is independent of the detailed form of the magnetic field and the metric on the 2-sphere .",
    "however , by specialising to the round metric on the 2-sphere and the rotationally invariant magnetic monopole field , we can bring the double cover @xmath0 of the isometry group into the picture . the twisted dirac operator and its kernel are now naturally acted on by @xmath0 and the kernel is , in fact , the irreducible @xmath0 representation of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "parametrising the 2-sphere in terms of a complex coordinate via stereographic projection , one can realise the zero modes in terms of holomorphic ( for @xmath6 ) or antiholomorphic ( for @xmath7 ) polynomials of degree @xmath8 .    in this paper we will review these results and use them to gain a better understanding of an index formula due to pope for the dirac operator on the taub - nut manifold , coupled to an abelian connection .",
    "the taub - nut manifold is the static part of the kaluza - klein description of a magnetic monopole @xcite .",
    "it is a riemannian 4-manifold with a self - dual riemann curvature and has the structure of a circle bundle over @xmath9 , with the fibre collapsing at the origin .",
    "the geometry encodes the dirac monopole connection on this bundle away from the origin but is smooth even when the fibre shrinks to a point . in that sense",
    ", the situation we consider may be thought of as a geometric and non - singular version of the dirac operator coupled to a dirac monopole on @xmath10 .",
    "topologically , the taub - nut manifold is @xmath11 , and index theorems are generally more difficult on non - compact spaces .",
    "however , exploiting the explicit form and @xmath12 symmetry of the taub - nut metric , pope found that , after coupling to an abelian gauge field with a suitably defined flux @xmath13 , the dimension of the kernel of the twisted dirac operator @xmath14 on taub - nut is [ popedim ] _",
    "p = 1 2 [ |p| ] ( [ |p|]+1 ) , where , for a positive real number @xmath15 , we define @xmath16 $ ] as the largest integer _ strictly _ smaller than @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to understand the @xmath0 transformation properties of these zero - modes , and we would like to gain a qualitative understanding why the dirac operator on taub - nut only has zero - modes if one twists it by a further abelian gauge field - even though the taub - nut geometry already encodes a dirac monopole .",
    "the curvature of the gauge field considered by pope is the , up to scale , unique rotationally symmetric , closed and self - dual 2-form on the taub - nut manifold with a finite @xmath17-norm .",
    "since the taub - nut manifold is topologically trivial there is no natural normalisation of this form , but in our discussion we will fix the scale by normalising the integral over the ` 2-sphere at spatial infinity ' . in terms of the detailed discussion of the taub - nut space in @xcite , we normalise the 2-form to be the poincar dual of the @xmath18 which compactifies the taub - nut manifold to @xmath19 .    with our normalisation",
    ", we treat the 2-form as the curvature of a ( topologically trivial ) bundle over taub - nut . however , we allow the structure group of the bundle to be @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 so that unitary representations of an element @xmath22 are by a phase @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "when we twist the dirac operator with this bundle , spinors may therefore have any _ real _ charge @xmath13 . on the topologically trivial taub - nut manifold",
    ", there is no dirac condition like to force the product of the ` magnetic ' and ` electric ' charge to be an integer or , equivalently , the gauge group to be @xmath21 .    here and in the rest of the paper we reserve electric - magnetic terminology for the @xmath21-gauge field encoded in the geometry of taub - nut and put it in inverted commas for the auxiliary @xmath25-gauge field , as above .",
    "while the ` electric ' charge of spinors is the external parameter @xmath13 , the electric charge of spinors is determined by the eigenvalue of the central @xmath21 in the @xmath12 isometry group .",
    "we find that the interplay between the two charges determines the number of normalisable dirac zero - modes .",
    "assuming for simplicity @xmath26 , we find that zero - modes are normalisable only if their electric charge satisfies with @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "moreover , we learn that , for each allowed value of @xmath3 , there is an @xmath3-dimensional space of zero - modes , forming an irreducible @xmath0 representations as for the dirac monopole .",
    "the space of zero - modes is the direct sum of these irreducible representations , reproducing and interpreting pope s dimension formula as the sum @xmath28 - 1)+[p]$ ] .",
    "our interest in the zero - modes of the dirac operator on the taub - nut manifold was triggered by geometric models of elementary particles recently proposed in @xcite . in this framework , the taub - nut manifold is a model for the electron , and the zero - modes discussed in this paper are candidates for describing the spin degrees of the freedom of the electron .",
    "our discussion shows that it is indeed possible to obtain a spin 1/2 doublet of states from the normalisable zero modes by picking @xmath29 .",
    "however , with this choice one inevitably also obtains a spin 0 singlet , as @xmath30 $ ] only sets an upper limit on the dimensions of irreducible @xmath0 representations .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of the doublet and the singlet at the end of our paper .    in view of the obvious generalisations of the dirac operator studied here - for example to the 4-geometries with line bundles proposed as geometric models for the proton and the neutron in @xcite",
    "- we have used this paper to prepare the ground for studies along these lines .",
    "we have taken care to set up consistent conventions regarding the various line bundles , connections and @xmath0 actions which we use .",
    "in particular , we have found complex coordinates more convenient than the more widely used polar coordinates and euler angles since the zero - modes can then be given in terms of holomorphic sections of the relevant line bundles .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "a brief summary of important background and conventions is given in the second half of this introduction , with much more detail provided in the appendix . in sect .",
    "2 we review the zero - modes of the dirac operator coupled to the dirac monopole , first on the 2-sphere and then on @xmath10 with a suitable mass term , induced by dimensional reduction .",
    "3 treats the twisted dirac operator on taub - nut , using the insights and terminology of sect .  2 .",
    "in view of possible extensions of our results we begin in a more general setting of self - dual and rotationally symmetric 4-manifolds but then specialise to the taub - nut manifold and the @xmath25-connection with a self - dual and normalisable curvature .",
    "4 contains our discussion and conclusions .",
    "the hopf fibration of the 3-sphere , associated line bundles over the 2-sphere and various differential operators acting on their sections all play important roles in this paper .",
    "these are mostly standard topics but since we draw on a broad range of them - from harmonic analysis on @xmath31 to holomorphic sections of powers of the hyperplane bundle @xmath32 - we require a set of consistent conventions for the calculations in this paper . we have collected basic definitions and our conventions in the extended appendix .",
    "it is explained there that @xmath33 is the line bundle associated to the lens space @xmath34 and that the dirac monopole of charge @xmath3 is an @xmath0-invariant @xmath21 connection on this bundle , with @xmath3 being both the monopole charge and the chern number .",
    "useful references for this material and its relation to dirac operators are the papers @xcite as well as , at a more introductory level , the textbooks @xcite .    in the following discussions , we use both euler angles @xmath35 and complex",
    "coordinates @xmath36 with @xmath37 to parametrise @xmath38 .",
    "both are defined in appendix  [ parametrisations ] and related via [ zdef ] z_1= e^-i 2 ( + ) , z_2= e^i 2 ( - ) . in angular coordinates , the hopf map @xmath39 maps @xmath35 to standard spherical polar coordinates @xmath40\\times [ 0,2\\pi)$ ] on the 2-sphere . in this paper",
    "we mostly work with complex coordinates for the 2-sphere , with @xmath41 parametrising a northern patch @xmath42 ( covering all but the south pole ) via stereographic projection from the south pole , and @xmath43 parametrising a southern patch @xmath44 ( covering all but the north pole ) via stereographic projection from the north pole and complex conjugation .",

    "this frame has the disadvantage of being ill - defined on both the north and the south pole . in terms of the complex coordinate @xmath57 , which is defined everywhere but at the south pole of @xmath58 ,",

    "one checks that the two frames are related by a a rotation : @xmath61 this rotation leads to a gauge change for the associated spin bundles which we will encounter later in our discussion .    carrying on with the 2-bein , we pick clifford generators in terms of the first two pauli matrices @xmath62 : _",
