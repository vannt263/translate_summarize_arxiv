    "observations indicate a significantly longer timescale is associated with the appearance of knots in stellar outflows .",
    "nearly all observed jets present small scale knots up to 0.1 pc from the central source , with a spacing between the knots corresponding to a timescale of @xmath0 1 - 20 yr ( e.g. hh30 - @xcite ; hh111 - @xcite ; rw - aur - @xcite ) .",
    "more fragmented knots are observed on a typical timescale of @xmath1 yr at larger distances from the source . while the long term variation of jets can be explained by variations in the accretion rates ( e.g. during fu - orionis phases ) , the possible origin of small scale knots is still unclear .",
    "a first possibility , suggested by similarities with extra - galactic jets , is that the knots may be formed by hydrodynamics kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite , mhd kelvin - helmholtz reflective pinch mode instabilities @xcite , or by current - driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations by these authors have shown that the shocks generated by plasma instabilities are weaker than those seen in observations once radiative cooling is taken into account . moreover , some jets ( e.g. hh212 - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a remarkable symmetry on both sides of the central star - disk system . this may be difficult to explain assuming that the instabilities are triggered by small scale perturbations .",
    "additionally , and more importantly , optical images in many cases show that the compact knots have a bow - shock structure ( e.g. hh111 - @xcite ) that is difficult to obtain supposing that the knots are formed by instabilities .",
    "a widely accepted theory for the presence of knots in stellar jets is related to the generation of internal working surfaces due to supersonic variations of the ejection velocity at the base of the jet @xcite . indeed ,",

    "we show that velocity variations which lead to the creation of knots similar to the observed ones may be generated by variations of the inner disk - wind radius .",

    "the asymptotic jet velocity along a fieldline @xmath2 anchored at the footpoint radius @xmath15 can be estimated from the bernoulli equation for large distances and negligible enthalpy as @xcite : @xmath27 the asymptotic jet velocity varies from fieldline to fieldline .",
    "however , we are ultimately interested in a typical value representative of the jet as a whole . therefore , we will weigh the asymptotic velocity with the mass - flux carried by the fieldline .    the asymptotic mass - flux along a fieldline per unit magnetic flux ( for one hemisphere )",
    "can be estimated by rewriting eq .",

    "as this figure clearly shows , an increase in the inner radius causes a decrease in the average velocity .",
    "moreover , the velocity variation is nearly independent of the ratio @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is a position of the inner radius chosen as a reference ) . to produce a variation of 20% in velocity it is necessary to have a variation of order of 30% in the inner radius .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows also the difference between the velocity of the disk - wind at the inner radius ( keplerian , see eq .",
    "[ eq : vjet ] ) and the average velocity ( defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : var ] ) .",
    "so far , we have dealt exclusively with the magnetic field of the disk - wind .",
    "these magnetic flux surfaces carrying the disk - wind are necessarily open to infinity .",
    "a non - open fieldline can not contribute to the global outflow . in the following we consider the superposition of a dipolar magnetosphere carried by the central star , contributing magnetic flux @xmath55 and the previously discussed magnetic field @xmath2 which threads the disk and carries the outflow .",
    "then the total magnetic flux is given by @xmath56 .",
    "this configuration leads to three different kinds of magnetic field lines as is illustrated in fig .",
    "firstly , fieldlines anchored in the polar region of the stellar surface . while these fieldlines are open to infinity , they are assumed to carry only negligible mass - flux and do not contribute significantly to the outflow .",
    "secondly , closed dipolar fieldlines anchored at lower latitudes of the stellar surface do not contribute to the outflow in our model .",
    "lastly , a global open magnetic field threading the disk , which carries the disk - wind .",
    "the transition from the closed dipolar fieldlines to the open disk - wind , i.  e. the location of the innermost open flux surface @xmath31 in the equatorial plane , is given by the location of the saddle point of the magnetic flux distribution    @xmath57_{r_0=r_{\\rm in } } = 0 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : defrin}\\ ] ]    where the dipolar field on the equatorial plane is given by a time - varying dipole moment @xmath58 as @xmath59 and @xmath2 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] .",
    "since both magnetic flux distributions are known , the inner radius of the disk - wind is given in terms of the time - varying stellar magnetic field ( defined on the stellar surface ) from eq .",

    "the inner radius of the ejecting region depends on the variation in the magnetic field intensity , and changes on timescales of @xmath62 .",
    "the average velocity will therefore change periodically following the magnetic field cyclic variation .",
    "( the amplitude of the stellar magnetic field variation ) for different values of @xmath66.,width=317 ]    a plot of the velocity variations , that is the difference between the maximum and minimum velocity , and normalized to the average velocity during one cycle of the stellar magnetic field , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as function of @xmath63 .",
    "the different curves are calculated corresponding to different values of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "a 50% variation in the stellar magnetic field produces a @xmath68 20% jet velocity variation , nearly independent of the value of @xmath66 .",
    "we have assumed that the only effect of a stellar magnetic field variation on the ejected jet is a change in @xmath69 .",
    "actually , some of the open stellar flux will thread the disk .",
    "therefore , the disk magnetic field ( including also the contribution from the open stellar magnetic flux ) will not decrease as @xmath70 and will also change with time following the change in the stellar dipole .",
    "a change in the stellar magnetic field produces changes in the mass - flux and velocity .",
    "in fact , the lever arm @xmath47 is a function of the magnetic field and of the mass flux ( that is also a function of the magnetic field ) . @xcite and @xcite studied models of self - similar mhd accretion disks driving jets .",
    "these authors showed that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the ejection parameter ( that relates the mass flux to the radius by @xmath73 ) .",

    "[ eq : vjet ] and [ eq : mdot ] may be written as : @xmath78 an increase of the magnetic field in the disk ( due to the increased stellar contribution ) produces an increase in the ejection parameter @xmath72 and of the mass flux , and a drop in the asymptotic velocity .",
    "therefore , the jet velocity decreases further with respect to the value calculated by eq .",

    "[ eq : varf ] reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : vmean ] .",
    "the ratio between the external and inner radius @xmath52 is difficult to determine theoretically , but has been recently constrained by observations .",
    "in fact , interpreting the observed transverse velocity shifts in t tauri microjets as indication of rotation , a range of ejecting radii corresponding to @xmath88 can be inferred ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , we may assume @xmath86 , and write the average outflow velocity normalized to @xmath44 as : @xmath89 where the scaling @xmath90 comes directly from @xmath91 .",
    "from this equation , it becomes clear that the stellar magnetic field variation necessary to produce a 20% variation in the average velocity may be much smaller than the 50% value determined from fig .",
    "the 50% value represents an upper limit to the necessary stellar magnetic field variation .",
    "is this section we discuss in some detail the approximations and the limitations of the model .",
    "first , to use the results from the standard disk - wind theory , we approximated the evolution of the system as a sequence of steady - state configurations .",
    "we made two key assumptions on the behavior of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "the first assumption of a dipolar stellar magnetic field at the inner edge of the disk is standard in the magnetospheric accretion model for young stars @xcite . on the stellar surface , magnetic fields as large as several kg",
    "have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the dipole component ( @xmath92 g on the stellar surface ) , which decays more slowly then the multipole components , dominates at large distances from the star .",
    "the second hypothesis is that a dynamo mechanism operates in protostars @xcite with a periodic or quasi - periodic variation of the magnetic field with a typical timescale of a few to tens of years .",
    "a dynamo mechanism is necessary to explain the observed magnetic field , because this would be dissipated on scales of order of @xmath93 yr , where @xmath94 is the stellar radius and @xmath95 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a dynamo mechanism , if present , is not necessarily cyclic as needed by our model",
    "however , recently @xcite proposed models of dynamos in low mass , fully convective stars with a cyclic magnetic field . the photometric variability observed in t tauri stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be related to a corresponding change in the stellar magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , our results depend on the complex interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the disk .",
    "this has been studied by a number of authors both analytically and numerically ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . it is well understood that the differential rotation in the disk produces a winding - up of the magnetic field lines on a timescale @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the stellar rotation frequency ) with a following opening of the stellar magnetic field lines and a consequent outflow .",
    "the later evolution of the system is unclear .",
    "once the magnetic field lines are opened , they can stay in that configuration indefinitely @xcite allowing a disk - wind to be ejected from an inner radius @xmath35 to an outer radius @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the stellar magnetic field lines are connected to the disk only in a small region around @xmath35 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath35 can be determined as the distance from the star where the magnetic stress @xmath98 begin to dominates over the viscous stress @xmath99 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath100^{2/7 }    \\label{eq : rin}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath101 are the star radius and mass , @xmath102 , and we assume @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 , defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : bvar ] ) and a full penetration of the vertical magnetic field lines into the disk .",
    "the same dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath105 is recovered and the results obtained in the previous section are unchanged .",
    "alternatively the stellar - disk magnetic field lines might close again via magnetic reconnection producing quasi - periodic ejections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results correspond to the hypothesis that the mass flux carried by the quasi - periodic ejections is much less then the mass flux carried by the disk - wind .",
    "if on the other side the mass flux carried by the coronal mass ejection is important , the stellar cycle would also produce a variation in the jet velocity .",
    "actually , in contrast with the disk - wind case , for a coronal mass ejection an increase in the magnetic field would produce an increase in the ejection velocity ( as found in simulations by @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in coronal mass ejections the magnetic energy is directly transformed in kinetic energy by reconnection events .",
    "we concentrated on a cyclic magnetic field as origin of the variations in the inner launching radius for the disk wind .",
    "however , any physical process that leads to quasi - periodic variations of the launching region will result in similar variations of the mean asymptotic velocity  and therefore to the appearance of knots  as long as those variations are large enough .",
    "it is unclear which process ( other than a stellar magnetic field variation ) might create variations on a @xmath106 yr timescale .",
    "@xcite showed that a relaxation oscillator may produce a change in the inner radius in x - ray binaries .",
    "the timescale of the oscillation depends on the details of the stellar magnetosphere and can vary by two orders of magnitude .",
    "a variation in the accretion rate may also produce a similar variation in the inner radius ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : rin ] , and the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that short period t tauri binaries do not seem to have jet properties different from those of wider binaries or single stars , arguing in this way against binarity as the origin of jet knots .",
    "@xcite also argued that there is no correlation between the ejection of a new knot in cw tau and an increase in source brightness .",
    "one might have expected this if the knot was caused by an accretion outburst .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that the alternation between x- and y - type interactions between stellar and disk magnetic fields as due to a magnetic field cycle could explain the observed periodicity .",
    "in this paper we explored the effect of a stellar magnetic field variation on the ejection velocity of protostellar jets .",
    "while large scale knots may successfully be explained by a large increase in the accretion rate , we showed that small scale knots may be produced by changes in the inner radius .",
    "we showed that a stellar magnetic field variation , if present , represents a natural candidate to produce stellar knots similar to the observed .",
    "in fact , a stellar magnetic field variation produces a change in the inner radius and therefore in the jet velocity .",
    "we also estimated that a stellar magnetic field variation @xmath107 50% produces a variation ( @xmath68 20% ) in the average velocity large enough to produce knots similar to the observed .",
    "the stellar magnetic field periodic or quasi - periodic variation remains an hypothesis of our scenario , but future large scale temporal observations of magnetic field in young stars , and progress in dynamo theory , will both help to provide an answer to this problem .",
