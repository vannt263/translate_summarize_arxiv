    "far away from phase boundaries , i.e. , deep in the one - phase region , condensed matter is perturbed by confining walls only within a thin layer proportional to the bulk correlation length @xmath10 , i.e. , at most approximately 15  .",
    "this changes drastically if the thermodynamic state of the bulk system is moved towards the boundary of phase transitions between the bulk phases .",
    "if the phase transition is of _ second _ order the bulk correlation length diverges and so - called critical adsorption occurs , i.e. , the perturbation due to the wall located at @xmath11 penetrates deeply into the bulk , resulting in an algebraic divergence of the thickness of the interfacial structure @xmath12 , where for a one - component fluid as a paradigmatic case @xmath13 is the bulk number density for a given temperature @xmath14 and chemical potential @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the fluid number density profile  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the order - parameter profile @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bulk critical number density , is governed by a universal scaling function which decays exponentially on the length scale of @xmath10 in the direction @xmath19 normal to the surface  @xcite . if the phase transition is of _ first _ order wetting phenomena occur as a result of a subtle interplay between the substrate potential , interactions among fluid particles , and entropic contributions , in particular interfacial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the interfacial structure diverges too , but here with exponents which are determined by the decay exponents of the pair potentials between the fluid particles and of the substrate potential @xcite .",
    "these two types of phenomena are of significant practical importance , in particular for the condensed phase being a fluidum near the gas - liquid transition , such as water near the thermodynamic coexistence with its vapor , or binary liquid mixtures such as water and hydrocarbons near liquid - liquid phase transitions . in this",
    "context various applications arise ranging from the use of colloidal suspensions @xcite to petroleum recovery @xcite .",
    "wetting films are relevant in many types of liquid coating processes , such as lubrication and adhesion and also for microfluidics and nanoprinting @xcite .",
    "critical adsorption plays an important role , e.g. , for heterogeneous nucleation in supercritical solvents @xcite or in micro- and nanofluidic systems in order to achieve wetting of these small structures  @xcite .     in the @xmath20 bulk phase diagram .",
    "the thick solid line indicates the bulk coexistence line .",
    "@xmath21 is the transition temperature for a critical wetting transition .",
    "thermodynamic paths ( i ) and ( ii ) , along which the behavior of the adsorption is discussed in the main text , are displayed as well as various crossover lines .",
    "the hatched area is the complete wetting regime .",
    "note that @xmath22 is larger than @xmath23.,width=264 ]    a characteristic property of liquids is that first - order gas - liquid or liquid - liquid phase transitions end at critical points .",
    "therefore critical adsorption and wetting must emerge from each other upon moving along the first - order phase boundary .",
    "this creates a puzzle .",
    "liquids governed by dispersion forces ( decaying asymptotically @xmath24 with distance @xmath25 ) belong to the ising universality class @xcite , i.e. , the critical exponents describing the singular behavior of various thermodynamic quantities and structural properties are those of the ising universality class .",
    "this also holds at interfaces .",
    "specifically , along bulk coexistence @xmath26 one has asymptotically  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the reduced deviation from the critical temperature @xmath29 and @xmath30 measures , in units of @xmath31 , the deviation of the chemical potential from its value @xmath32 at two - phase coexistence , whereas along the path @xmath33 @xmath34 where the critical exponents @xmath35 , and @xmath36 take the values of the ising model ( in @xmath37 : @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xcite ) . the latter universal singularity @xmath40 is weaker than the non - universal one @xmath41 for complete wetting @xcite , although according to the general renormalization group ( rg ) arguments the dispersion forces , which are responsible for this non - universal behavior , at first glance should give rise only to corrections to scaling ( i.e. , subdominant power laws ) .",
    "naturally the question arises how the system manages to restore universality ( i.e. , dominance by the weaker universal power law ) upon moving from the non - universal complete wetting behavior to the universal critical adsorption behavior .",
    "this issue has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite and the proposed scenario is such that upon approaching bulk coexistence , i.e. , for @xmath7 fixed and @xmath42 ( see path ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) , the system will _ always _ cross over ultimately to the complete wetting regime but such that upon approaching @xmath29 ( i.e. , for smaller @xmath43 ) this crossover occurs closer and closer to the coexistence curve . the proposed mechanism is based on the argument that long - ranged dispersion forces are relevant and can dominate if the thickness @xmath44 of the wetting layer is much larger than the bulk correlation length @xmath45 . as described more closely in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , for dispersion forces in @xmath37 , this occurs if @xmath46 ( see the hatched area in fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , upon approaching @xmath29 this complete wetting regime becomes vanishingly small .",
    "this expectation follows similar arguments as how dispersion forces become irrelevant for , e.g. , two - point correlation functions in the bulk or for the critical adsorption profile itself , for which rg theory predicts exponential decays which , however , are dominated asymptotically by the algebraic decay due to the dispersion forces . nonetheless the universal scaling functions , which capture the exponential decay , are expected to describe also the neighborhood of @xmath29 correctly , even in the presence of the irrelevant dispersion forces .",
    "so far this puzzle has not been resolved satisfactorily by explicit calculations .",
    "the main reason is that mean field theory ( mft ) as the natural theoretical starting point does not capture the correct @xmath37 exponents , which is essential for disentangling the different contributions and to describe the crossover . within mft , @xmath47 and",
    "the adsorption diverges only @xmath48 . in systems governed by short - ranged forces only , within mft",
    "both critical adsorption and complete wetting follow a divergence @xmath49 and therefore they can not be distinguished ; but the divergences differ beyond mft .",
    "however , going beyond mft is a difficult theoretical challenge , due to the spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "there is also an urgent experimental need to resolve this issue .",
    "an ellipsometry study of gravity - thinned complete wetting layers in the binary - liquid mixture of cyclohexane and methanol @xcite reports results which are _ not _ in accordance with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the data indicate the divergence of the film thickness upon approaching the bulk critical temperature characterized by a critical exponent which is distinct from the expected , critical exponent for the bulk correlation length . scaling arguments",
    "have been put forward according to which the observed _ effective _ exponent is associated with a broad , intermediate scaling regime facilitating the crossover from complete wetting in the presence of dispersion forces to critical scaling @xcite .",
    "also recent neutron reflectometry data for the adsorption from alkane - perfluoroalkane mixtures at fluorophobic and fluorophilic surfaces @xcite are _ not _ in agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "these authors have found that the behavior of the adsorption , as a function of temperature in the one - phase region upon approaching liquid - liquid coexistence with the composition well removed from the critical composition , can be represented by a power law with an exponent which differs from both that for complete wetting and that for critical adsorption @xcite .",
    "the predictions described above for the crossover between the complete wetting regime of fluids with long - ranged interactions and the critical regime are based on general scaling arguments and on the analysis of simple models for the effective interface hamiltonian which are supposed to describe the relevant physics at length scales much larger than the bulk correlation length @xcite .",
    "only few microscopic studies are available which test these ideas @xcite .",
    "those are based on density functional methods and are of mean - field character , which in @xmath37 provides a correct description of complete wetting in the presence of dispersion forces but fails in the regime dominated by critical fluctuations .",
    "this makes it even more important to thoroughly analyze a model system which takes into account both the bulk and surface critical fluctuations of semi - infinite systems near @xmath29 as well as the interfacial fluctuations associated with wetting phenomena .    as a representative of the corresponding universality class ,",
    "an ising ferromagnet is well suited for such an analysis .",
    "in addition , addressing the issue in two spatial dimensions ( @xmath50 ) allows one to gain deep insight because the `` exact '' solvability provides , inter alia , the correct exponents .",
    "there is a recent experimental interest in such genuine two - dimensional systems in the context of proteins immersed in a fluid two - component lipid membrane which is near phase separation , including a critical point belonging to the @xmath50 ising universality class @xcite .",
    "if two such proteins are close to each other the structural properties of the membrane between them can be described in terms of the strips studied here , giving even rise to interesting effective interactions between the proteins .    in the present analysis we use the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    "method @xcite to numerically investigate the behavior of the adsorption in a two - dimensional ( @xmath50 ) ising model with short - ranged as well as long - ranged surface fields .",
    "the dmrg method provides essentially exact numerical results for thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions , including the magnetization profiles .",
    "this allows us to study systematically the adsorption properties along various thermodynamic paths and thus to test the aforementioned predictions of the mesoscopic , effective interface hamiltonian approaches .",
    "the dmrg method is based on the transfer matrix approach and it is a numerically very efficient iterative truncation algorithm for constructing the effective transfer matrices for large systems .",
    "the method was originally developed by white @xcite for the diagonalization of quantum spin chains .",
    "it was then adapted by nishino @xcite to two - dimensional classical systems .",
    "the dmrg method allows one to study strips that are infinitely long with widths up to @xmath51 lattice constants with arbitrary surface and bulk fields .",
    "the comparison with exact results in the case of a vanishing bulk field and in the presence of contact surface fields shows that the dmrg method provides a very high accuracy for a broad range of temperatures .    because the method requires finite values of @xmath52 the influence of the distant surface on the structural properties near the surface under study can not be neglected , in particular , near the critical point  even for strips as wide as @xmath51 .",
    "on one side , this for the dmrg method unavoidable confinement of the system complicates the aforementioned crossover behavior due to finite - size effects and capillary condensation . on the other side",
    ", the interplay between complete wetting , critical adsorption , and capillary condensation do not appear to have been discussed before , although it might be of relevance for adsorption - induced colloidal aggregation in binary liquid mixtures @xcite .",
