    "the study of black - body radiation has played a prominent role in the discovery of quantum mechanics .",
    "more recently , the quantum features of light have been revealed in many beautifull optical experiments , and found to be in full agreement with the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation @xcite . in particular , we cite the bunching of photons .",
    "bunching refers to the tendency of photons to arrive together at closely spaced detectors , resulting in super - poissonian counting statistics ( variance large than the mean ) .",
    "while a classical explanation is available @xcite , the detailed understanding and description of the phenomenon requires quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the bunching of photons , and more generally of bosons @xcite , is usually explained in terms of the more familiar quantum statistical exchange force which introduces an effective attraction between identical bosons , when their wavefunctions overlap @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of bunching was first observed by hanbury brown and twiss @xcite as the correlation between intensities of light from a single star falling on different detectors .",
    "bunching of photons in a single detector experiment was later observed @xcite and found to be in agreement with a simplified quantum mechanical argument by glauber @xcite . for the case of equilibrium black - body radiation",
    ", the photon count has been calculated explicitly @xcite and is given by a negative binomial distribution rather than the poissonian distribution which describes independent arrivals .    in this letter",
    ", we show that this result for the photon counting statistics is essential to find agreement with a recent result from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , namely , the so - called fluctuation theorem .",
    "this theorem states that the probability distribution @xmath0 to observe an entropy production @xmath1 during a time interval @xmath2 in a nonequilibrium steady state obeys the following symmetry relation for asymptotically long values of @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3 in words , the probability of observing a positive entropy change is exponentially larger than that of the corresponding negative change .",
    "when the system starts in a state of canonical equilibrium which is subsequently perturbed by a time - dependent change of the hamiltonian , the above fluctuation theorem , referred to as the transient fluctuation theorem , is valid for all times , and not just asymptotically large ones @xcite.the fluctuation theorem has been verified in several theoretical @xcite and experimental settings @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the fluctuation theorem is to be found in the time - reversal symmetry of the underlying hamiltonian dynamics . as such",
    ", this result can be viewed as a generalization of the ideas of onsager @xcite .",
    "we shall investigate the steady state of radiation exchange between two black bodies , at equilibrium at different temperatures , when they are connected to each other through a small aperture . to present the problem and to contrast the role of the quantum mechanical bunching for photons with that of classical particle exchange , we start by studying the classical counterpart of effusion of the ideal gases .",
    "consider two infinitely large reservoirs @xmath4 and @xmath5 , each containing classical ideal gases at ( canonical ) equilibrium with temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 and densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we perform the following experiment ( see fig . [ figigsetup ] ) . during a fixed time interval @xmath2 ,",
    "a small hole of surface area @xmath10 between the reservoirs is opened .",
    "we assume , for better comparison with the photon crossings , that the opening contains an energy filter , allowing only particles with kinetic energy in the range @xmath11 to move across the hole .",
    "the net amount of energy @xmath12 and net number of particles @xmath13 transferred from @xmath4 to @xmath5 are measured .",
    "we consider the limit of a small energy window , @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 , and the exchange in the number of particles is the only relevant variable . since the hole is small enough so that the canonical equilibria in the reservoirs are not significantly perturbed , the corresponding entropy change @xmath16 is given by standard thermodynamics : @xmath17 inserting the well - known espressions @xcite for the chemical potentials @xmath18 of the ideal gases in reservoirs @xmath19 , one finds : @xmath20^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right).\\ ] ] since the particle exchange @xmath13 is the result of individual gas particle crossings , it is obviously a random variable , and hence so is @xmath16 .",

    "we define @xmath22 as the probability that @xmath23 particles leave the reservoir @xmath24 in the specified time interval .",
    "as all the particles move independently of one another , @xmath22 is poissonian @xcite : @xmath25 the escape rate @xmath26 can be calculated following standard arguments from kinetic theory ( see fig .",
    "[ figtr ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath27 since the escape of particles from the left and right reservoirs are independent phenomena , @xmath21 is given by the sum @xmath28 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pois ] ) and ( [ eq : som ] ) leads to the following explicit expression for @xmath21 : @xmath29 recalling that the modified bessel function @xmath30 is an even function of @xmath13 , the fluctuation theorem is verified by direct substitution of this result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft ] ) .",
    "we mention a simpler proof , more clearly related to the underlying micro - reversibility .",
    "consider the exchange process , with @xmath31 particles going from @xmath32 , and @xmath33 particles from @xmath34 .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath35 .",
    "the time reversed process , with @xmath33 particles going from @xmath32 and @xmath31 particles from @xmath34 , has probability @xmath36 .",
    "their ratio satisfies the following detailed fluctuation theorem : @xmath37^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\exp\\left\\{\\left[\\frac{1}{t_{b}}-\\frac{1}{t_{a}}\\right]\\frac{e_{0}}{k}\\right\\}\\right)^{{\\delta n } } = e^{\\frac{{\\delta s}}{k}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) and ( [ eq : ds ] ) .",
    "the fluctuation theorem itself follows immediately .",
    "we have @xmath38     ( these are located in the cylinder with volume @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) . inserting the maxwellian velocity distribution and adding up all contributions from the different angles leads to the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate]).,scaledwidth=20.0% ]",
    "we now turn to a similar set - up for the study of fluctuations in black - body radiation .",
    "two large empty cavities ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , whose walls are kept at a fixed , but different temperatures , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , act as sources of black - body radiation ( see fig . [ figphsetup ] ) . during a fixed time interval @xmath2 ,",
    "radiative exchange becomes possible by opening a small aperture ( surface area @xmath10 ) , which permits free passage of photons with a frequency in the range @xmath43 .",
    "we again consider the limit of a monochromatic filter @xmath44 .",
    "following standard thermodynamics , the entropy change @xmath16 , upon transfer of a net number of photons @xmath13 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( and hence of energy @xmath45 ) , is given by : @xmath46 photons coming from the two different reservoirs are independent of each other .",
    "hence the probability @xmath21 to observe a net transfer of @xmath13 photons from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : som ] ) .",
    "however , photons coming from the same reservoir are not independent , and their escape is no longer governed by a poisson distribution .",
    "the calculation of @xmath22 , which is also referred to as the photon counting distribution , requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the electromagnetic field @xcite . for large times @xmath47",
    ", it is given by the following negative binomial distribution : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 it is now a matter of simple algebra to verify that the following detailed fluctuation theorem is obeyed : @xmath51 consequently , following the steps of eq .",
    "( [ pft ] ) , the fluctuation theorem is also verified.we emphasize that the correlations between the photons , resulting in the negative binomial distribution , is an essential ingredient .",
    "a semiclassical approach , which assumes statistical independence between photons , can not be reconciled with the fluctuation theorem ( see appendix ) .    , a small hole is opened and the net transfer of energy @xmath12 is measured.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we close with a number of comments on the above results.we have presented the analysis above for the case of a monochromatic window connecting the reservoirs .",
    "this permits the derivation of a detailed fluctuation theorem .",
    "it is also revealing to note that the entropy production becomes identically zero for the classical gas for a particular choice of the energy window : the r.h.s .",

    "such an equilibrium state can be used to reach optimal thermodynamic carnot and curzon - ahlborn efficiencies @xcite .",
    "this type of equilibrium can also be achieved with electrons @xcite , but not with photons because the latter have zero chemical potential.the fluctuation theorem for the effusion of an ideal gas is valid for all times , while for photons the theorem has been proven here only for large times .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the effusion of an ideal gas is a process without memory .",
    "in such a case , the distinction between the steady state and transient versions of the fluctuation theorem disappears .",
    "a transient theorem for photons valid for all times can also be obtained in principle , but this would require the exact evaluation of the transient photon count , starting from zero and progressing to the steady state , after the aperture is opened.as expected from the general argument connecting bunching to the statistical exchange interaction , one finds that fermions display anti - bunching @xcite .",
    "while this phenomenon has no classical analogue , it is surprising to find , for example , that the statistics of an electron current through a small channel can be fully reproduced by a simple classical random walk model , namely , the symmetric exclusion process @xcite . for this simple model ,",
    "the fluctuation theorem is again verified .",
    "the validity of the fluctuation theorem for fermions has also been confirmed by quantum field theoretic calculations @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical description assumes the photons to be independent of each other . the photon counting distribution is then given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pois ] ) and ( [ eq : som ] ) . in this case , the quantum aspects of the photons are only taken into account via their occupation number density as implied by planck s law of radiation .",
    "this leads to the following result for the escape rate : @xmath53 the ratio of these rates ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : dft ] ) ) does not yield the desired result @xmath54 with @xmath16 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) , and hence the fluctuation theorem is not satisfied.the picture of independent photons has been used to calculate the average number of photons leaving compartment @xmath24 in a time interval @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since this quantity is not influenced by bunching , the correct result is obtained in this case : @xmath55 integrating over @xmath56 , one recovers the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "however , the higher order moments are not correctly reproduced in the independent photon picture ."
