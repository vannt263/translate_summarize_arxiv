    "<S> we introduce a variable useful for measuring masses of particles pair produced at hadron colliders , where each particle decays to one particle that is directly observable and another particle whose existence can only be inferred from missing transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this variable is closely related to the transverse mass variable commonly used for measuring the @xmath0 mass at hadron colliders , and like the transverse mass our variable extracts masses in a reasonably model independent way . without considering either backgrounds or measurement errors </S>",
    "<S> we consider how our variable would perform measuring the mass of selectrons in a msugra susy model at the lhc .    </S>",

    "<S> hep99/07 + june 1999 +    1.cm    * measuring masses of semi - invisibly decaying + particles pair produced at hadron colliders * 1.3 cm c.  g.  lester and d.  j.  summers .2 cm _ high energy physics group , cavendish laboratory , + madingley road , cambridge cb3 0he , england _ 2.3 cm    before 1983 , @xmath1 colliders dominated the search for new particles , their clean final states making identification of new particles far easier than at hadron machines . however in 1983 this changed with the observation of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 bosons by the ua1@xcite and ua2@xcite collaborations at the cern @xmath3 collider . despite the more difficult conditions where the initial state protons and anti - protons gave rise to an underlying event which complicates measurement of the final state , the higher energies available to a @xmath3 machine meant they discovered the @xmath0 and @xmath2 bosons before other machines had enough energy to produce them . </S>",
    "<S> this trend continued in 1994/5 when cdf and d discovered the @xmath4 quark at the tevatron @xmath3 collider @xcite . to date </S>",
    "<S> the only direct experimental evidence that we have for the @xmath4 quark is from the tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the greater energies available to @xmath3 machines gives them an advantage in discovering fundamental particles , and we can hope that this trend will be continued at the lhc . upon discovery of a new particle </S>",
    "<S> the first question that is asked is what is the mass of this particle . </S>",
    "<S> there are two fundamentally different ways of measuring the mass of a particle . </S>",
    "<S> usually one tries to extract the mass of the particle directly from the observed events . </S>",
    "<S> for example ua1 and ua2 detected the @xmath2 boson in its decay to lepton pairs @xmath5 or @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for each event that contains a pair of leptons one can construct the mass of the particle that produced the leptons as , @xmath7 and on an event by event basis obtain a direct estimate the mass of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively one could make an indirect model dependent measure of the @xmath2 mass by measuring the `` @xmath2 event '' cross - section , and using a model that predicts the @xmath2 cross - section in terms of the @xmath2 mass , perform a fit to the measured cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> for measuring the @xmath2 mass the direct measurement is superior , if only for its lack of model dependence , however when measuring the mass of the @xmath0 boson the case is less clear . at the cern </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 collider the @xmath0 boson was detected in its decay to a charged lepton and a neutrino , however the neutrino goes unobserved and so only gives rise to missing momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this means that one ca nt directly observe the @xmath0 mass from the lepton and neutrino momenta . </S>",
    "<S> ua1 @xcite formed the transverse mass variable , @xmath8 where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this variable has the property that , @xmath10 with equality possible for events where the lepton and neutrino are produced with the same rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> thus although one ca nt obtain the @xmath0 mass from a single event , one can obtain a lower limit on the @xmath0 mass . </S>",
    "<S> in addition if one obtains the lower mass bound from many events , this can approach the @xmath0 mass , and so one can extract the @xmath0 mass in a model independent way . </S>",
    "<S> ua1 @xcite along with ua2 @xcite also performed a model depenendent fit to the @xmath11 spectrum for the lepton , extracting the @xmath0 mass from that model .    in practice , though , measuring the @xmath0 mass with @xmath12 does have some small model dependence , as the precise fraction of events which occur with @xmath12 close to @xmath13 is still dependent on the physics processes which produce the @xmath0 boson , and how the @xmath0 boson decays . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the missing transverse momentum is poorly measured experimentally compared with @xmath14 , so the theoretical model dependence of the measurement of @xmath13 from the @xmath14 spectrum is balanced by the experimental error on extracting @xmath13 from the edge of the @xmath12 spectrum .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we wish to introduce a variable which measures particle masses , which like transverse mass has little dependence on exactly how such massive particles are produced . </S>",
    "<S> the variable is used for the generic process shown in figure [ fig : generic ] , where a hadronic collision pair produces a massive particle whose dominant decay is into one observed and one unobserved particle . </S>",
    "<S> this unobserved particle can only be detected from the missing momentum that it carries away , and that the massive particle is pair produced means that we can only measure the missing momentum of the pair of invisible particles . </S>",
    "<S> although this may sound like an unusual process to look for new particles , it naturally occurs in any theory where there is an ( approximately ) conserved charge , and the lightest particle with that charge is only weakly interacting . two examples of where such a situation can occur are susy models and a 4th lepton generation . in r - parity </S>",
    "<S> conserving susy models , sparticles are pair produced , and cascade decay to the lightest sparticle , which must be stable and is expected to not be directly detectable . </S>",
    "<S> slepton production and decay can often follow this route : @xmath15 in such an event the pair of lightest susy particles , @xmath16 , go unobserved and only leave their signature as missing transverse momentum .    for a 4th generation </S>",
    "<S> lepton the charged lepton would be pair produced in a drell - yan type process , decaying to a neutrino and a @xmath0 boson , @xmath17 the ( probably massive ) @xmath18 going unobserved , while the @xmath0 bosons could be detected in their decays to either @xmath19 or to jets .    </S>",
    "<S> we now look specifically at the process given in equation [ eq : susy ] , although the variable which we define would work identically in any process where a particle is pair produced and decays to one visible and one invisible particle .    </S>",
    "<S> the variable that we wish to introduce is closely related to @xmath12 , however the standard definition of @xmath12 , given in equation [ eq : mt ] , assumes that the unobserved particle is massless , so we return to the derivation of this variable . for the decay , @xmath20 for arbitrary momenta we can write , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the difference in rapidity , @xmath24 $ ] , between between the @xmath25 and @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> now as @xmath26 we have , @xmath27 this gives a version of transverse mass valid for arbitrary masses , with equality when the @xmath25 and @xmath16 are produced with the same rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the transverse mass ca nt be formed directly from the process in equation ( [ eq : susy ] ) , as both the neutralinos give rise to missing momentum , however we can experimentally measure the sum of their transverse momenta as the missing transverse momenta in the event , @xmath32 if @xmath33 and @xmath34 were obtainable , then one could form two transverse masses , and using the relationship ( [ eq : mtd ] ) obtain , @xmath35 however , not knowing the form of the splitting ( [ eq : ptmsum ] ) , the best we can say is that : @xmath36 \\label{eq : mt2}\\ ] ] with the minimization over all possible 2-momenta , @xmath37 , such that their sum gives the observed missing transverse momentum , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the variable , called @xmath39 , that we wish to introduce . </S>",
    "<S> this bound we can obtain directly from experimentally measured parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although not totally transparent , for particular momenta , @xmath39 can be equal to @xmath40 ; the requirement being that for both slepton decays the lepton and neutralino are produced at the same rapidity ( although the sleptons themselves can be at differing rapidities ) , and in addition , @xmath41 we have not managed to derive a general analytic expression for the minimization over splittings of @xmath38 ; largely because an experimental measurement of @xmath38 only measures the missing transverse momentum , and neither the missing energy nor the missing longitudinal momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath38 is not a 4 vector , which means that @xmath39 can not be calculated in a manifestly lorentz invariant manner . </S>",
    "<S> the complication that this introduces to the minimization is enough to making an analytic solution non trivial . </S>",
    "<S> however if we take one of the parameters that we minimize over to be @xmath42 ( _ i.e. _ that @xmath43 ) , and in addition note that longitudinal momenta play no part in the definition of @xmath39 , then the remaining minimization becomes lorentz invariant , and this means that it can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves one minimization over @xmath44 that we performed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the form of this minimization is not particularly illuminating , and so we do not give it here ; however a computer code for evaluating @xmath45 is available from the authors .    of course </S>",
    "<S> , the variable @xmath39 is only good at extracting particle masses from processes having many events close to the maximum allowed value , and this depends on the physics of the process being measured . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a priori , we can not say that @xmath39 is useful for measuring particle masses in all processes . </S>",
    "<S> however we expect typical physics processes to have reasonable numbers of events close to the maximum value allowed for @xmath39 and hence expect it to be a useful variable . to illustrate the variable in use , we consider a model which allows the process shown in equation ( [ eq : susy ] ) , at the expected lhc centre of mass energy @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> our susy model is the fifth minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) @xcite point selected by the lhc committee in 1996 for detailed study by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model is characterized by , @xmath47 we generate events using the susy version of the herwig generator @xcite . for our purposes the only important features of the model that we use to produce our events are , @xmath48 the angular distributions for the sleptons are given by the drell - yan process that produces spin-0 particles , while the decay of the sleptons is isotropic due again to their being spinless . </S>",
    "<S> herwig serves to build up a reasonably realistic underlying event , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ that @xmath49 . defining the missing momenta as , @xmath50 we generate 1105 events , which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath51 , which the lhc should collect in approximately one year of low luminosity running .    in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mt2 ] we show the @xmath39 distribution for this model . </S>",
    "<S> quite clearly the maximum @xmath39 value allowed corresponds well to the mass of the selectron , with the @xmath39 distribution tending smoothly to zero at that point . </S>",
    "<S> while such an edge is not as easy to measure as a vertical drop , we still expect that such an edge would be detectable experimentally , and hence a viable means to measure the selectron mass . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound on @xmath39 is @xmath52 , however this does not give a means to measure the lsp mass , the lower bound on @xmath39 follows directly from equation ( [ eq : mtd ] ) , and this is a parameter that goes into the calculation of @xmath39 . indeed </S>",
    "<S> if the value of @xmath52 is unknown in addition to @xmath40 one can only obtain a relationship between the two . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mlvsmchi ] we show the value of @xmath40 that would have been obtained from the same events shown in figure [ fig : mt2 ] , using differing input values for @xmath52 in the calculation of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that slepton mass that one would extract from the events behaves approximatly as , @xmath53 and so any uncertainty in the lsp mass will be directly reflected as an error in the extracted selectron mass . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be noted that the edge of the @xmath39 distribution becomes hard to fit as the input @xmath16 mass deviates from the physical @xmath16 mass as the @xmath39 distributions develops a tail at the largest @xmath39 values .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , in this paper we have introduced a new variable for measuring masses of particles produced at hadron colliders , where the longitudinal momentum of the hard scattering is typically unmeasured . </S>",
    "<S> it may be used when particles are pair produced , with each decaying to one particle that is directly observed and one particle that is not directly observed . </S>",
    "<S> this variable is analogous to the transverse mass variable , @xmath12 , commonly used for measuring the @xmath0 mass in its decay to @xmath19 at @xmath3 colliders , except that it works where the particle being measured is pair produced and where the unseen particle is massive . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the masses extracted using our variable , like those from the transverse mass , will be largely independent of the physics processes which produce the particles , and hence give a viable means of extracting masses in a model independent way . as an illustration of this variable in action we consider measuring the mass of selectrons in susy at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the results look promising however as we have not considered the effects of any background processes or experimental mis - measurement errors further study is required@xcite . </S>"
