    "the so - called adiabatic piston @xcite is a typical example showing the relevance of fluctuations to explain the macroscopic behavior of a system .",
    "it consists of an isolated cylinder containing two gases separated by an adiabatic piston ( no internal degrees of freedom ) .",
    "usually , the system is initially prepared with the gases in both compartments at independent equilibrium states and the piston fixed by a clamp at a given position .",
    "then the clamp is removed and the piston is free to move without friction with the container .",
    "one of the interesting features of this system is that equilibrium thermodynamics can not predict the final position of the piston and the states of the gases to both sides of the piston .",
    "nevertheless , when fluctuations are taken into account , it follows that the piston moves until the system relaxes to mechanical and thermal equilibrium with equal pressures and temperatures in both compartments . in the last years",
    ", the problem has attracted a lot of attention @xcite , mainly stimulated by the seminal paper by lieb @xcite and the suitability of the model to investigate fundamental issues in mesoscopic systems .",
    "an illuminating review of the adiabatic piston is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "granular gases , modeled as ensembles of particles colliding inelastically , exhibit many similarities with molecular gases , but also a rather large number of peculiar behaviors as a consequence of energy dissipation . in particular , they do not have equilibrium states and are inherently non - equilibrium systems . for this reason ,",
    "they have been considered as a proving ground for kinetic theory and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . in this context",
    ", an adiabatic piston separating two granular gases appears as a natural system to investigate the effects of the irreversible dynamics on the interaction between macroscopic systems .",
    "@xcite considered the case in which the two inelastic gases are initially prepared in the same macroscopic state , the homogeneous cooling state , and the particles collide elastically with the piston .",
    "they found that the piston eventually collapsed to one of the sides of the container .",
    "this behavior was explained in terms of the instability of the initial state , leading to an spontaneous left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "asymmetric inelastic pistons , with both sides made of different materials with different inelasticities , have also been considered @xcite . in these studies , it has been assumed that the piston moves in an infinite bath of elastic particles either with a gaussian velocity distribution @xcite or with a velocity distribution in which only two discrete opposite velocities are possible @xcite .",
    "of course , the two kind of systems , elastic piston and inelastic gases versus infinite baths of elastic gases colliding inelastically with the piston , are rather different . in the former case",
    ", the system is continuously cooling while in the latter a steady state is reached after some transient .    here the model of the symmetric elastic piston separating two inelastic gases is revisited .",
    "the aim is to incorporate in the description given in @xcite the effect of the velocity fluctuations of the piston .",
    "this is the mechanism for which energy is transferred between the left and right hand side gases , leading in the case of molecular gases to an equilibration of the temperature .",
    "it will be shown that some kind of equilibration also happens in the case of granular gases , although driven by a parameter different from the temperature .",
    "the quantity that becomes the same is the cooling rate of the two gases and also of the piston . quite interestingly , these conditions lead to the existence of a non - equilibrium phase transition with an spontaneous symmetry breaking , when the mass of the piston exceeds some critical value , which depends on the number of particles and on the inelasticity of the collisions between them .",
    "the phase transition is accurately described by a simple kinetic theory that incorporates the effect of the velocity fluctuations of the piston .",
    "the results fit into an scenario in which the whole system composed by the gases in both compartments and the piston reaches a cooling state characterized by a unique temperature parameter . the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are recovered in the limit of an infinitely massive piston .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the system under consideration",
    "is specified and the simple theoretical model is formulated . also the states to be addressed are specified .",
    "evolution equations for the temperature parameters of the granular gases and the piston in those states are written down .",
    "two different kind of states are possible . in one group ,",
    "the system is symmetric to both sides of the piston , while in the other group the initial left - right symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "both states are discussed in secs .",
    "[ s3 ] and [ s4 ] , respectively .",

    "[ s5 ] the theoretical predictions are compared with molecular dynamics simulations and a good agreement is observed in all the accesible parameter region .",
    "the final section contains some concluding remarks and also a discussion of the possible implications of the reported results for the understanding of the interactions between macroscopic granular systems .",
    "the system considered consists of a cylinder of length @xmath0 filled with @xmath1 inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath2 ) or disks ( @xmath3 ) of mass @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the cylinder is divided into two compartments by a piston of mass @xmath6 perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the container , taken as the @xmath7-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the piston can move without friction along the @xmath7 direction , its motion being entirely induced by the collisions with the gas particles .",
    "there are the same number of particles , @xmath8 , at each side of the piston .",
    "inelastic hard spheres or disks of mass @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the piston can move without friction along the @xmath7 axis , as indicated in the figure .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    the system is isolated and evolves freely in time .",
    "collisions between particles are characterized by a constant ( velocity - independent ) coefficient of normal restitution @xmath9 , defined in the interval @xmath10 . on the other hand , collisions of the particles with the piston and with the walls of the container are elastic .",
    "attention will focus here on states in which the position of the piston has a stationary value @xmath11 . in these states",
    ", mechanical equilibrium requires that the hydrodynamic pressure @xmath12 be the same at both sides of the piston .",
    "the variables corresponding to each of the compartments will be identified by a subscript @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "it will be assumed that the gas remains always very dilute in both compartments and that , as a lowest order approximation , the granular gas is homogeneous inside each compartment and it can be described by the equations for the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that the relative flux of energy through the piston is very low as compared with the characteristic relaxation time of the hcs .",
    "also , it requires that the system is not too large so that the hcs is stable @xcite and the shearing and clustering instabilities are avoided .",

    "of course , no macroscopic or thermodynamic interpretation is assigned to this quantity , although it is expected to be a decreasing function of time .",
    "more precisely , the energy balance equation for the piston yields @xmath34 equations ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.3 ] ) , and ( [ 2.10 ] ) form a closed set of four equations for the unknown @xmath11 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    to simplify the calculations and allow for an analytical solution , attention will be restricted in the following to those cases where @xmath38 is small , so that , assuming that @xmath39 is of the order of unity ( something to be checked a posteriori ) , eq .",

    "this is what happens in equilibrium molecular systems , where velocity correlations between the three macroscopic systems are negligible and the equilibrium distribution for the velocity factorizes .",
    "on the other hand , when dealing with granular gases , velocity correlations between the two compartments and the piston are relevant , the velocity distribution of the whole system does not factorize and the three temperature parameters differ .",

    "actually , a similar result holds in vibrated granular systems , in the sense that only a temperature is needed for a macroscopic description of mixtures of granular gases @xcite . here , the result is extended to spatially separated granular gases interacting through a movable piston .",
    "a consequence of the cooling rate being the same as compared with the temperatures being the same , is the existence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking discussed in this paper .",
    "the phenomenon can be easily understood in terms of rather simple kinetic theory arguments , whose theoretical predictions are in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results .",
    "an interesting issue to be addressed in the near future is why the asymmetric state is more stable than the symmetric one when both states exist .",
