    "kepler s supernova remnant ( snr ) ( g4.5 + 6.8 ) is 400 years old ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see for review ) and provides an unrivaled opportunity to verify the belief that supernova remnants are the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "cas  a is younger ( by @xmath060 years ) and was detected at tev @xmath1-ray energies @xcite , which implies the acceleration of high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "older remnants , such as rx j0852.0 - 4622 @xcite and rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , both thought to be 1,000@xmath02,000 years old , have also been detected .",
    "if snr age was the dominant factor in for cosmic - ray acceleration , one might expect similar levels of cosmic ray acceleration in kepler s snr .",
    "of course , other variables , such as sn type , local environment , and distance , will certainly have some impact on the likelihood of tev gamma - ray detection from a snr .",
    "kepler s sn was considered to be a type ia supernova ( sn ) based on an interpretation of the historical light curve @xcite .",
    "it was later shown that the light curve was also in agreement with a type ii - l sn @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations of thermal x - ray emission by _ asca _ @xcite and _ chandra _ @xcite demonstrated that the snr resulted from a thermonuclear supernova ( type ia ) , rather than the core - collapse of massive star ( type ii ) , even though there is evidence that the remnant is interacting with the progenitor star wind material .",
    "it may be that a type ia event took place in a more massive progenitor star with a strong wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite have modeled kepler s snr and predicted a detectable tev gamma - ray flux under various assumptions on distances and supernova kinetic energies that had been previously discussed in the literature .",
    "their prediction can be probed by the h.e.s.s . and the future _ glast _ experiments .",
    "the cangaroo - iii imaging cherenkov atmospheric telescope is less sensitive by a factor of 35 than h.e.s.s . ; however , it is able to study a specific parameter range of the models , i.e. , around the region of a supernova explosion energy of 10@xmath2erg and distance of 4.8kpc . here",
    ", we report on the result of the 2005 april observations . as extensions to the @xcite theory",
    "have successfully explained the gamma - ray fluxes from other historical snrs , it is important to investigate and constrain the allowed parameter ranges in this model with measurements of fluxes or upper limits .",
    "the cangaroo - iii stereoscopic system consists of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located near woomera , south australia ( 31@xmath3s , 137@xmath3e ) .",
    "each telescope has a 10 m diameter segmented reflector , consisting of 114 spherical mirrors made of fiber - reinforced plastic @xcite , each of 80 cm diameter , mounted on a parabolic frame with a focal length of 8 m .",
    "the total light - collecting area is 57.3m@xmath4 . the first telescope , t1 , which was the cangaroo - ii telescope @xcite , is not presently in use due to its smaller field of view and higher energy threshold .",
    "the second , third , and fourth telescopes ( t2 , t3 , and t4 ) were operated for the observations described here .",
    "the camera systems for t2 , t3 , and t4 are identical and are described in @xcite .",
    "the telescopes are located at the eastern ( t1 ) , western ( t2 ) , southern ( t3 ) and northern ( t4 ) corners of a diamond with sides of @xmath0100 m @xcite .",
    "the point - spread functions of these telescopes are 0.@xmath324 .",
    "the observations were carried out during the period from 2005 april 11 to 17 ( ut ) using the  wobble mode \" in which the pointing position of each telescope was shifted in declination by @xmath50.5 degree every 20 minutes @xcite from the target : ( ra , dec [ j2000 ] ) = ( 262.@xmath3671 , @xmath621.@xmath3486 ) .",
    "we made no off source runs , as the wobble mode enables off - source regions to be observed simultaneously with the target regions .",
    "the sensitive region in wobble mode observations is considered as being within one degree from the average pointing position .",
    "this snr is located 6.@xmath38 from the galactic plane ; therefore , no significant diffuse gamma - ray background is expected within the field of view .    in the observations ,",
    "the hardware trigger used to select any two telescope hits was employed @xcite .",
    "the images in two out of three telescopes were required to have clusters of at least five adjacent pixels exceeding a 5photoelectron threshold ( off - line two - fold coincidence ) . to illustrate the effect of this criterion ,",
    "the event rate was reduced from 10@xmath012 to 6@xmath08hz for t3t4 coincidences , depending on the elevation angle .",
    "looking at the time dependence of these rates , we can remove data taken under cloudy conditions .",
    "the effective observation time was 874 minutes , and the mean zenith angle was 15.@xmath32 .",
    "the light - collecting efficiencies , including the reflectivity of the segmented mirrors , the light guides , and the quantum efficiencies of the photomultiplier tubes were monitored by a muon - ring analysis @xcite with individual trigger data during the same period .",
    "the average light yield per unit arc - length of muon rings is approximately proportional to the light - collecting efficiencies .",
    "deterioration in these efficiencies is mostly due to dirt and dust settling on the mirrors and light guides , which are washed annually to improve their reflectivities . in analyzing t2 data",
    ", we had some difficulties in detecting muon - rings during this period ; therefore , we did not use t2 in this analysis . unfortunately these observations were made shortly before regular mirror washing .",
    "also we had some mis - setting of the t2 adc - gate width in this period .",
    "this analysis , therefore , used only t3 and t4 two - fold coincidence data .",
    "the analysis procedures used here were identical to those described in @xcite , except for the point that these were two - fold coincidence data .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite . here , we briefly describe them .    at first , the image moments of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite were calculated for the two telescopes .",
    "the incident direction of the gamma - ray was determined by minimizing the sum of the squared widths ( weighted by the photon yield ) of the two images seen from the assumed position ( fitting parameter ) with a constraint on the distances from the intersection point to each image center .    in order to derive the gamma - ray likeliness",
    ", we used the fisher discriminant ( hereafter @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the input parameters were @xmath10 where @xmath11 are energy - corrected @xmath12 and @xmath13 for t3 and t4 .",
    "we rejected events with any hits in the outermost layer of the cameras (  edge cut \" ) .",
    "these rejected events were potentially incompletely sampled , resulting in errors particularly in the @xmath8 distribution , which would have produced deformations of the @xmath9 .    then @xmath9 distributions were derived on a position - by - position basis . comparing those in the signal region and the control background region with the monte - carlo expectation",
    ", we can derive the number of gamma - ray  like events . here",
    ", we assume the @xmath9 distribution of the gamma - ray signal to be that derived from monte - carlo simulations . in the gamma - ray simulations we used a spectrum proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath1=@xmath62.1@xmath50.2 .",
    "fits of the @xmath9 distribution of the source position with the above simulated signal and control background functions were carried out to derive the number of gamma - ray  like events .",
    "this was a one - parameter fitting with the constraint that the sum of the signal and the background events corresponds to the total number of events , i.e. , the fitted parameter can be derived exactly analytically .",
    "since the spatial size of kepler s snr ( 100@xmath15 ) is much less than our angular resolution ( @xmath16 = 0.24@xmath3 ) , we concentrate here on searching for a point source near the target center .    in order to determine whether or not there is a gamma - ray excess around the snr",
    ", we made the @xmath9 distribution within the psf ( @xmath17 ) and fitted it with a background function derived from the @xmath9 distribution in the region @xmath18=(0.10.2 ) , and a signal function from monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the fitting parameter is the ratio of gamma - rays to total number of events .",
    "the fitting results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the best - fit excess was 71@xmath532 events , where the uncertainty is the 1@xmath16 statistical error .",
    "the gamma - ray response function from the monte - carlo simulation is shown by the red histogram .",
    "the threshold of this analysis is estimated from the monte - carlo simulation to be @xmath0500gev . the systematic error on the energy determination is considered to be less than 15% , with the main factor being the uncertainty in the light collection efficiency and atmospheric conditions .",
    "we then made a radial distribution of gamma - ray  like events .",
    "@xmath9 distributions in various @xmath18 slices were made .",
    "the control background region was again selected in the @xmath18 range of between 0.1 and 0.2 deg@xmath4 . the standard fitting procedure described above",
    "was carried out .",
    "the fitted result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath19 for a null assumption ( the dot - dashed line ) is @xmath19/dof=25.4/25 ( where dof is degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the best fit with the point spread function ( psf ) is shown by the dashed histogram , where @xmath19/d.o.f=18.1/25 .",
    "the dashed histogram is the 2@xmath16 upper limit ( 135-event excess ) for the psf excess .    in order to examine the morphology",
    ", we segmented the field of view into 0.2@xmath200.2 degree@xmath4 square bins .",
    "the @xmath9 distributions for corresponding bins were made and fitted .",
    "the control - background region is defined as the second - closest layer of 16 bins , all of which are more than 0.3deg from the center of the target region , i.e. , larger than the 0.24 degree point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the statistics of the control - background are , therefore , sixteen times larger than that of the signal bin .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "we smoothed the results by averaging the neighboring nine bins .",
    "our sensitivity falls off significantly beyond one degree in radius from the center .",
    "the psf is the 0.24 degree radius circle which fully contains the radio observed snr ( the thin - white contours ) . according to the monte - carlo simulations , 65% of gamma - rays from this snr should be contained in this circle .",
    "the psf is not a gaussian and has a broader tail component . in order to contain 90% of events",
    ", we need to broaden this cut to 0.5 degree , resulting in a loss of sensitivity .",
    "we , therefore , selected the cut at 0.24 degree ( 1@xmath16 region ) .",
    "the significance distributions ( excess divided by the statistical error before smoothing ) are approximately normal ( gaussian ) distributions with a mean value of 0.21@xmath50.13 , and a standard deviation of 1.19@xmath50.12 , consistent with null assumption within systematic uncertainties .",
    "the statistical significance of the maximum located 0.@xmath335 west - north - west from the center is ( before smoothing ) 3.3@xmath16 , and therefore not compelling .",
    "there is no statistically - significant excess that is consistent with emission from kepler s snr convolved with the telescope psf .",
    "the derived upper limits ( uls ) for the gamma - ray flux are shown in table  [ table1 ] .    .the",
    "2@xmath16 upper limits to the integral fluxes from kepler s snr at five energy thresholds .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath1 , of the energy spectrum ( e@xmath21 ) is that used in the monte - carlo gamma - ray simulations .",
    "note that the gamma - ray acceptance depends on @xmath1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , we used a @xmath22 spectrum for the gamma - ray simulation . the uls range between 1030% of the crab nebula flux . the statistically insignificant excess near the center of the field of view , shown in figs",
    ".  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] only appeared in the lower energy regions . at higher energies , we do not see any excess .",
    "therefore the uls at lower energies were higher than that at higher energies .",
    "the upper limits given in table [ table1 ] are plotted on spectral energy distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the vertical and horizontal units were fitted to figs .  3 and 4 in @xcite in order to discuss the allowed parameter ranges with respect to our observational upper limits .",
    "this theory considered a reasonably wide range of possibilities for the distance of this snr ( 3.47kpc ) and the supernova explosion energy ( 0.52@xmath2010@xmath2erg ) .",
    "other adopted parameters , such as the cosmic ray injection rate , expansion rate , and electron - to - proton ratio , while plausible , are open to debate .",
    "we do not review those details here but refer readers to the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the black curve with arrows at both ends were obtained from this observation .",
    "three types of the energy spectra ( @xmath23 ) were used for acceptance correction using the monte - carlo simulation . the uncertainty due to",
    "the assumption of the energy spectral index is small on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the colored curves were obtained from a theoretical prediction by @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the distance to the object was fixed to be 4.8 kpc .",
    "the red , green , blue , and yellow curves correspond to different supernova explosion kinetic energies and corresponding number densities of ambient circumstellar material , which came from fitting to the observed shock radius and speed .",
    "the most probable is the second one ( the green curve ) and our upper limits are ( in part ) below it , meaning that for a distance of 4.8kpc the explosion energy should be less than @xmath24erg .",
    "although the green curve is close to a best estimation , a large allowable range of parameter space remains .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the case when the supernova explosion energy is fixed at 10@xmath2erg , and several distances in the allowed range @xcite are assumed .",
    "distances less than @xmath05kpc are ( for this fixed sn energy ) not favored , suggesting that this snr is marginally more distant than the best current observational estimations .",
    "of course , this conclusion also assumes that all other assumptions in the model are correct , for example , that the expansion is in sedov phase , that the supernova was type ia , that 10% of kinetic energy is transferred to the cosmic - ray energy , etc .",
    "the constraints on the parameters of the distance @xmath25 and the ambient density @xmath26 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    here",
    "we assume that the total number spectrum of protons is proportional to a power law with an exponential cutoff @xmath27 and that the neutral pion decay @xmath1-ray emission dominates .",
    "if the conversion efficiency ( @xmath28 ) from the explosion energy @xmath29 to the cosmic - ray energy is assumed to be 10% ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , the normalization factor of the proton spectrum can be determined and the @xmath1-ray fluxes can be calculated @xcite on the assumption of the power - law index @xmath31 and the cutoff energy @xmath32 . given the parameters of the @xmath29 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , the upper limits of @xmath33 are calculated from the observed 2@xmath16 upper limits in table  [ table1 ] , compared with the integral fluxes of the model , because the @xmath1-ray fluxes @xmath34 are proportional to @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we plotted the upper limits for the power - law indices 2.1 ( solid ) , 1.9 ( dashed ) , and 2.3 ( dotted ) and for the cutoff energies of protons @xmath36 ( black ) , @xmath37 ( red ) , and @xmath38 ev ( blue ) .",
    "we did not plot the case of @xmath39 and @xmath40ev , as the flux in the gev energy region exceeds the egret upper limit .",
    "the apparent radius @xmath41=100@xmath15 of the kepler s snr at @xmath42 gives another constraint .",
    "here we consider two solutions on the expansion law of the blast - wave shock .",
    "the first one is the sedov - taylor solution : @xmath43 .",
    "another one is the approximate analytic solutions @xcite , which can be applied from the ejecta - dominated phase to the sedov - taylor phase . in the latter case",
    ", the extra parameters of ejecta mass @xmath44 and the ejecta power - law index @xmath45 , are added to the explosion energy @xmath46 and the ambient matter number density @xmath26 .",
    "the region which is satisfied with the sedov - taylor solution of the apparent radius of the kepler s snr , 100@xmath15 at 400 yr and @xmath47 erg are shown as the hatched one in fig.6 .",
    "the dot - dashed lines are obtained from the approximate analytic solution with ejecta mass of 1.4@xmath48 with the explosion energy @xmath49 erg with two kinds of the ejecta power - law index @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the case of @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "ev , we note that the cangaroo - iii upper limit implies that the kepler s snr is located at a distance larger than about 4.5kpc . for the maximum upper limit in the case of @xmath52 and @xmath40",
    "ev , this means that the snr is located at a distance larger than about 3.6kpc .",
    "the distance of a type ia supernova can be estimated using the correlation between the shape of the optical light curves and the intrinsic luminosity of sne .",
    "before knowledge of this correlation , @xcite studied the historical light curve of the kepler s sn and classified it as a type ia , and @xcite estimated the distance of @xmath54 kpc using only the maximum luminosity .",
    "we can now fit baade s data with the improved light - curve template of a type ia @xcite : @xmath55 kpc on the assumption of a visual extinction @xmath56 mag @xcite , although the fitted light curve after 100 days is not a good fit .",
    "this value seems to be marginally consistent with our lower limit obtained by this tev @xmath1-ray observations . on the other hand , based on the study of hi kinematics and the association of hi cloud with the snr",
    ", @xcite put a lower limit of @xmath57kpc and an upper limit of 6.4kpc on the distance .",
    "these estimations do not contradict our lower limit .",
    "in any case , a part of the plausible region in parameter space has been rejected , although a large allowed range remains .",
    "although we did not detect any signal in these 15 hours of observations , future detections may strongly constrain the theory . as found in figs.3 & 4 in @xcite , the sensitivity of h.e.s.s .",
    "is much lower than the theoretical predictions",
    ". the future glast mission will also enable the lower energy range to be probed . future large cerenkov telescope arrays , such as cta",
    "will allow even more sensitive observations to be made .",
    "tev gamma - ray observations toward the 400 year old remnant of kepler s sn were made in 2005 april .",
    "although a measurable flux of tev - gamma rays had been predicted , we did not observe any statistically significant excess in this region , and the constraints on the allowed parameter range have been discussed .",
    "although a region of parameter range has been rejected , more sensitive measurements are required to constrain the models further .",
