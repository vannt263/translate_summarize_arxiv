    "in a quantum theory of scattering , the in / out - states are commonly chosen as delocalized plane waves .",
    "this model allows one to tremendously simplify the calculations ; however , its limits of applicability are not explicitly articulated in the overwhelming majority of textbooks . under standard conditions , finite sizes of the wave packets , their spreading during a collision , and finiteness of an interaction region",
    "do not play any essential role , especially for ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "there are , however , important exceptions .",
    "the first example in which this model fails to work is collision of beams with the large impact parameters  the so - called md - effect , observed at the collider vepp-@xmath4 in novosibirsk @xcite .",
    "a somewhat similar effect is collision processes with a @xmath3-channel singularity when initial particles are unstable @xcite .",
    "it is beams finite sizes that provide natural regularization of the divergence .",
    "the next illustration is neutrino oscillations  a phenomenon that is intrinsically spatially and temporarily localized @xcite .    if colliding particles wave fronts are neither plane nor gaussian , even approximately , then the plane - wave approximation is no longer valid either .",
    "the so - called vortex ( or twisted ) particles with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) relative to a propagation axis and the airy beams represent the simplest examples of such non - plane - wave states .",
    "they were shown to be solutions of the wave equations @xcite , and the corresponding beams of photons , electrons , and neutrons were generated in recent years @xcite .",
    "vortex electrons with the kinetic energy of @xmath5 kev can be focused to a spot of an @xmath6ngstr@xmath7 m size @xcite , their oam can be as high as @xmath8 @xcite , their magnetic moment increases proportionally to @xmath9 @xcite , and this brings about new effects in the electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "such photons and electrons were also proved useful for optical manipulation @xcite , for probing phase of a transition amplitude , for creating pairs entangled in their oam @xcite , etc .    besides that",
    ", several groups have recently managed to create even more sophisticated photonic quantum states , including those combining features of the vortex- and airy beams @xcite ; and one can await generation of the corresponding states of massive leptons and hadrons in near future . although these novel beams differ from the coherent states , as they possess a distinct set of quantum numbers , the difference between them , mathematically speaking , lies only in the phases of their wave functions @xmath10 .",
    "a consistent relativistic scattering theory beyond the plane - wave approximation is absent by now , even though a number of non - plane - wave solutions for relativistic wave equations have long been known @xcite . for vortex beams ,",
    "a corresponding ad hoc formalism has been recently developed by ivanov and serbo @xcite .",
    "generalization of their procedure for other quantum states ( e.g. for coherent states , the airy beams , etc . ) may nevertheless represent a challenge .",
    "it is highly desirable therefore to have at hand an approach that would enable us to study scattering of the wave packets _ whatever their wavefront is _ , that is , for arbitrary phases of their wave functions .",
    "this work aims at developing such a method by generalizing the customary ( plane - wave ) s - matrix formalism . in doing so",
    ", we follow the work @xcite in which the incoming particles are described by their wigner functions .      the reader may well ask why we should deal with the wigner formalism , especially when we are already going to treat sophisticated non - plane - wave effects . indeed , although this approach was successfully applied both for non - relativistic- and relativistic scattering problems ( see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , it does not seem to have drawn much attention .",
    "the answer is that this formalism turns out to be the most convenient and elegant tool in the paraxial regime when @xmath11 , complementary and alternative to the wave - function approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    to put it in more detail , consider a generic matrix element @xmath12 which is a functional of the plane - wave one @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the in / out wave functions .",
    "the number of events depends on @xmath15 integrated over all pairs of momenta , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with some weights .",
    "such products of amplitudes can not , as a rule , be reduced to the standard traces and the terms such as a pair of spinors @xmath18 have to be expanded over a complete set of @xmath19 dirac matrices .",
    "this makes the customary calculation procedure rather cumbersome and technically challenging ( although not impossible per se ) .",
    "conversely , both the momenta coincide in the plane - wave limit when @xmath20 .",
    "therefore when the packets are narrow , @xmath11 , the following inequality holds true : @xmath21 a density matrix written in these variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is called the wigner function , introduced by wigner in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is this inequality that allows one to develop a perturbation theory in which the ratio @xmath2 serves as a small parameter , the in / out - states are described by their wigner functions , and the number of events , a luminosity , and the cross section are expanded into @xmath2-series .",
    "when @xmath25 , the particle s wave front turns flat and the phase of its wave function does not contribute to the observables .",
    "conversely , for any finite @xmath26 the cross section gets corrections that depend explicitly on phases of the incoming states .",
    "it turns out that for any finite @xmath26 the observables grow dependent not only on the absolute value of the amplitude @xmath27 but also on its phase @xmath28 .",
    "the problem of determining the phase of scattering amplitudes is of high importance for hadronic physics and has a long history ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 is calculated in different models , including regge approaches , and it is extracted from elastic @xmath30 and @xmath31-collisions . it is known that at the small transferred momenta @xmath32 this function is small , @xmath33 , on the energy scale from several gev to several tev @xcite , thus manifesting the high value of the phase @xmath28 .",
    "a proper analysis of the elastic proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at @xmath34 tev by the totem collaboration @xcite has also shown that the real part of the amplitude can dominate for the large transferred momenta @xcite .",
    "finally , just a few months ago the totem collaboration managed to estimate the amplitude s phase at @xmath35 tev in the interval of @xmath32 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 with a much better accuracy than before @xcite .",
    "as we demonstrate in this paper , scattering beyond the plane - wave approximation does not allow one to extract the coulomb- or hadronic phase itself , but it does allow us to estimate how these phases change with @xmath3 or with the scattering angle @xmath38 .",
    "we make an analysis that does not depend on the phases of the incoming states .",
    "first steps towards this direction have been taken by ivanov for vortex beams in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.@xmath39",
    "we give general formulas for the probability and the cross section within the wigner formalism .",
    "we calculate several different wigner functions in sec.@xmath40 , including the ones of a vortex particle and of an airy state . in the latter case",
    "we compare an exact wigner function with the corresponding approximate expression derived when @xmath41 .",
    "in sec.@xmath42 we give a general approximate formula for such a function of a wave packet with an arbitrary complex phase .",
    "the lorentz invariant generalizations are given in sec.@xmath43 .",
    "sec.@xmath4 is devoted to derivation of a general probability formula when the in - states represent the wave packets with phases .",
    "the corresponding generalization for beams is presented in sec.@xmath44 .",
    "the first non - vanishing corrections to the plane - wave results are given in secs.@xmath45 .",
    "a qed example is given in sec.@xmath46 .",
    "the effects of the scattering amplitude s phase are discussed in sec.@xmath47 . in sec.@xmath48",
    "we solve a similar problem but when the out - states are described as the bessel ones with some oam .",
    "we summarize in sec.@xmath49 .    in what follows the terms `` a wave function '' and `` a phase",
    "'' will refer mostly to the momentum representation , and we mark @xmath50 everywhere .",
    "as we do not put any limitations on the scattering amplitude , we shall use the term `` scattering '' , for the sake of conciseness , for all the elastic and inelastic @xmath51 processes .",
    "the units @xmath52 are used .",
    "let us consider a generic ( not necessarily elastic ) scattering of two wave packets with @xmath53 final plane waves with the momenta @xmath54 . as demonstrated by kotkin _",
    "@xcite , the scattering probability can be represented as a functional of the ( generalized ) cross section @xmath55 and a function that we shall denote @xmath56 and call _ the particle correlator _ : @xmath57 where @xmath58 ^ 2 } , \\cr & \\displaystyle   \\varepsilon_f = \\sum\\limits_{i=3}^{n_f+2}\\varepsilon_i ( { \\bm p}_i),\\,\\ , \\varepsilon ( { \\bm p } ) = \\sqrt{{\\bm p}^2 + m^2},\\ { \\bm p}_f = \\sum\\limits_{i=3}^{n_f+2}{\\bm p}_i,\\,\\ , { \\bm u}_{1,2 } = { \\bm p}_{1,2}/\\varepsilon_{1,2 } ( { \\bm p}_{1,2 } ) , \\label{ma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the amplitudes @xmath59 no longer depend on the normalization volume @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a ( bosonic part of a ) particle s wigner function with the following properties : @xmath62 note that in this approach we do not need fermionic wigner functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) , because the spin parts of all wave functions are factorized and enter into the amplitude @xmath63 .",
    "that is why the wigner functions that we shall use in this paper are lorentz scalars .",
    "the function @xmath64 coincides with a conventional definition of the plane - wave cross section .",
    "the dependence on @xmath65 appears because of translational non - invariance of the wigner function and in the plane - wave case this invariance is recovered ( see below ) . for the well - normalized wigner functions , the probability ( [ m ] ) represents an unambiguous quantity in a sense that it does not depend on the auxiliary normalization variables , such as @xmath60 and @xmath66 . when making a comparison with the plane - wave case , it is convenient , however , to define also _ the effective cross section _ by dividing the probability by a luminosity factor @xmath67 , @xmath68 note that the quantities @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are lorentz - invariant , whereas the correlator is not .",
    "probability formula when all the particles , including the final ones , are not plane waves but rather some generic wave packets with the phases can be derived following the very same procedure as described in ref.@xcite . for a special case with only two final states ,",
    "the result reads : @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents a _",
    "@xmath4-particle correlator _",
    ", @xmath73 is an integration measure for the final states , @xmath16 and @xmath65 denote the sets of all vectors : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "this expression can be useful when the final detected state is characterized not with the @xmath40-momenta and probably with spins , but with a different set of quantum numbers . in this case",
    "the measure @xmath73 may also include discrete variables such as the oam . a need for spatial- and temporal localization of the detected states appears , for instance , in the theory of neutrino oscillations @xcite or in qed calculations with the twisted photons @xcite .",
    "before we turn to scattering , let us take a closer look at the wigner functions and their properties .",
    "if the system is in a pure state with a wave function @xmath10 , then its wigner function can be found as follows ( see , for example , a good pedagogical introduction by case @xcite or the textbook @xcite ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 in what follows we shall derive and analyse several examples of such functions . since the integral in ( [ wa ] ) can not be always evaluated exactly , we shall develop a method for obtaining a suitable approximate expression , applicable when @xmath78 .",
    "the literature on the wigner functions of optical vortices , airy beams and their generalizations is extensive  see , for example , refs.@xcite .",
    "here we do not intend to make a comprehensive comparison of our results with those obtained in optics .",
    "in this paper we employ only wave packets with a gaussian envelope in momentum representation , bearing in mind that a wide class of packets can actually be approximated by this form ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the corresponding wave functions in configuration space may appear to be non - gaussian , because of the phases .",
    "parameters characterizing the packets are : a mean momentum @xmath79 , a momentum uncertainty @xmath80 , and a phase @xmath81 .",
    "while the latter is lorentz invariant , a dispersion @xmath82 generally transforms under the lorentz transformation not as a scalar , but as a @xmath40-vector : @xmath83 we also introduce a @xmath40-tensor @xmath84 which can be non - diagonal but still symmetric in an arbitrary frame of reference . for a boost along ,",
    "say , z axis we have @xmath85 with @xmath86 in a frame where the packet is at rest on average .",
    "it is much more illustrative , however , to start with the customary `` non - relativistic '' expressions for packets with the only one @xmath80 .",
    "that is to say , we first work in the frame of reference in which @xmath87 lorentz invariant generalizations for packets with @xmath88 are straightforward , and it will be done at the very last stage in sec.[lor ] .",
    "let us consider a gaussian wave packet with the following wave function : @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes initial conditions .",
    "lorentz invariance of the normalization requires that @xmath91 transform as an inverse volume : @xmath92 in accordance with eq.([sigmatr ] ) .    substituting ( [ psia ] ) into eq.([wa ] ) , we see that the main contribution to the integral comes from the small values of @xmath65 : @xmath93 ( recall the ineq.([ineq ] ) ) : @xmath94 therefore , we can make the following expansion @xmath95 within this accuracy , we arrive at the simple expression ( compare with that for coherent states @xcite ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 as a cautionary remark , we note that this is not yet the true mean path of the system , as it still depends on @xmath16 , not @xmath98 .",
    "although the function ( [ wgaussa ] ) itself does not spread , it is consistent with the momentum - coordinate uncertainty relations .",
    "it also satisfies the continuity equation , @xmath99 and represents a relativistic @xmath1 d generalization ( that is why @xmath100 ) of the corresponding function of a quantum oscillator , and when @xmath101 it describes the so - called quasi - classical trajectory - coherent state of a boson ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the higher - order terms that we have neglected in ( [ varepsilona ] ) , give corrections to ( [ wgaussa ] ) of the order of @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , taking into account the next term in the expansion ( [ varepsilona ] ) , @xmath103 we obtain the corresponding correction to eq.([wgaussa ] ) , @xmath104 where the second term in parentheses is supposed to be small compared to unity , and that is why this function stays everywhere positive in all the orders in @xmath80 .    in the plane - wave limit with @xmath105",
    ", we find @xmath106 from where we get the following useful rule ( recall eq.([sigmainv ] ) ) @xmath107      having obtained the everywhere positive wigner function of a gaussian wave packet , we can now derive a similar expression for a beam of @xmath108 identical non - interacting particles .",
    "such a function is a result of the statistical averaging of the wave - packets with some distribution over the packets centers , @xmath109 : @xmath110 and we imply that the distance between the particles , @xmath111 , does not exceed the coherence length of one wave - packet @xmath112 , that is , @xmath113 for a gaussian beam with @xmath114 we find : @xmath115 where @xmath116 note that for a beam , the momentum uncertainty @xmath80 and the spatial width @xmath117 are two independent parameters , and in the overwhelming majority of practical cases @xmath118 say , for the lhc proton beam with @xmath119 m and @xmath120 @xcite , we have @xmath121 and , therefore , @xmath122 .",
    "the case with @xmath123 is realized , for instance , for 300-kev electrons focused in a spot of 1 @xmath124 @xcite ; and now @xmath125 .",
    "a bessel state is characterized with the following quantum numbers : the longitudinal momentum @xmath126 , an absolute value of the transverse momentum @xmath127 , the energy @xmath128 , and a projection of the oam onto the propagation axis , @xmath129 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the wave function is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the azimuthal angle , and one can use the following rules @xmath132 the corresponding wigner function can be found exactly applying eq.([wa ] ) : @xmath133_z\\ , 2\\tan \\xi \\big ) } , \\label{wbess}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 and the heaviside function is extended so that @xmath135 .",
    "this wigner function can be negative , it is invariant under the lorentz boosts along the z axis , and it coincides up to a common factor with the so - called wolf function in optics ( see eq.(22 ) in ref.@xcite ) .    as can be easily shown , @xmath136 as should be for an azimuthally symmetric bessel state .",
    "hence , the maximum value of @xmath9 is @xmath137    the singularity @xmath138 is integrable , and all the properties of a generic wigner function ( [ w ] ) hold true .",
    "the lack of time dependence means the absence of spreading , the well - known feature of the bessel beams . unlike the wave function ( [ psib ] )",

    "when the longitudinal momentum has also the same uncertainty , we arrive at the generalization of the coherent state ( [ wgaussa ] ) : @xmath148 as can be seen , the wave packet with the oam implies , similar to the pure bessel state , a finite transverse momentum and in the plane - wave limit , @xmath105 , the oam vanishes .",
    "we would like to emphasize that even for a state with @xmath149 , the mean absolute value of the transverse momentum appears to be non - vanishing , @xmath150 as can be readily checked ( see eq.(40 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "then angular distributions of the scattered electrons are measured and compared in the upper- and in the lower semi - spaces .",
    "their difference reveals itself in the asymmetry and its conservative estimate for the scattering angles of @xmath429 is @xmath430 which is in principle measurable with high statistics .",
    "one could further increase it by performing measurements at yet smaller scattering angles or by making the impact parameter very large , @xmath431 . in the latter case , however , the price is a drop in the number of events .",
    "returning to the elastic scattering of protons , little can be said , unfortunately , in a model - independent way about the factor in the left - hand - side of ( [ zetatheta ] ) .",
    "the totem collaboration has managed to perform measurements at the scattering angles lower than @xmath432 at @xmath35 tev @xcite , which yields @xmath433 , and the hadronic phase @xmath28 itself , unlike the coulomb one , is _ not _ attenuated by a small parameter @xmath434 , as scattering within a diffraction cone is not described by the perturbation theory .    as an example",
    "let us take three following models for the hadronic phase employed in the recent experiment at the lhc @xcite : @xmath435 where @xmath436 is assumed to be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "taking the same parameters as in @xcite , i.e. @xmath437 , we can estimate the asymmetry in eq.([eq6 t ] ) .",
    "for the proton beam s width of @xmath438 m we get the results shown in fig.[fig_asymm ] .",
    "it is evident that the asymmetry is suppressed by the small factor @xmath439 although at the small transferred momenta interference of the hadronic phase with the coulomb one can become prominent @xcite , the asymmetry ( unlike the one for electron scattering ) stays prohibitively small due to the large @xmath117 .",
    "thus the effects of the amplitude s phase are governed by width of the colliding beams .    ) for different models of the hadronic phase and @xmath440 . the red line : the standard parametrization , blue line : the one by bailly et al .",
    ", green line : peripheral parametrization .",
    "[ fig_asymm],width=340,height=207 ]      within the second scenario , we start with a head - on collision of two vortex beams with the impact - parameter @xmath231 , the phases @xmath441 , @xmath442 , and opposite signs of their orbital helicities @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of such beams is no longer gaussian but a doughnut - shaped one with a minimum on the collision axis ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "as before , we need not necessarily to swap the beams or even change the signs of their oam .",
    "it is enough to compare angular distributions of the final particles in the upper- and in the lower semi - spaces , that is , when @xmath443 .    still working in the frame ( [ frame ] ) , we find with the help of eq.([mean_value ] ) : @xmath444 this vector vanishes , together with the asymmetry , when either the total oam is zero , @xmath445 , or one collides the azimuthally symmetric bessel beams with @xmath446 ( which is implied in the frame ( [ frame ] ) ) .",
    "clearly , what is happening here is that in order to have a non - zero @xmath447 the azimuthal symmetry of the problem must be broken _ already in the initial state _",
    ", exactly as in the previous scenario .",
    "when the impact - parameter is vanishing , violation of the ( initial ) azimuthal symmetry can be achieved by shifting a phase vortex off the beam s symmetry axis .",
    "when dealing with the holograms ( as in refs.@xcite ) , a shift of a fork dislocation off the beam center provides a ( small ) azimuthal asymmetry or , in other words , a non - vanishing transverse momentum ( see details , for example , in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the probability density for such a state is depicted in the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "such a shift is to be small , @xmath448 , @xmath449 and it is made to opposite directions for both beams . to put it simply , a non - vanishing transverse momentum plays in this scenario the same role as does a finite impact parameter in the previous section .    by using eq.([asyminframe ] ) , we arrive at the following estimate for the asymmetry : @xmath450 the major difference between this expression and eq.([eq6 ] ) is appearance of the factor @xmath451 , which can be very large .",
    "it might seem therefore that the second scenario with @xmath452 provides a much higher value of the asymmetry .",
    "however the price for this increase is again a drop in statistics due to the factor @xmath453 in the number of events . by analogy with eq.([eq6a ] ) , the factor @xmath454 determines sensitivity to the asymmetry in relativistic case .",
    "the maximum value of oam for which the number of events is not suppressed is @xmath455 ( see eq.([lpackmax ] ) ) , and that is why @xmath456 exactly as in the previous scenario .",
    "since the production of twisted hadrons with azimuthally non - symmetric profiles seems to be more technologically challenging than it is for electrons , we turn to elastic scattering of the latter particles . in order to maximize the effect",
    ", one can take again @xmath365-kev twisted electrons focused to @xmath457 , with the monochromaticity ev , however , for the electrons focused to a spot of @xmath423 the momentum uncertainty gets higher : @xmath458 kev . ]",
    "@xmath459 , and @xmath460 . for measuring the asymmetry ,",
    "angular distributions of the scattered electrons are to be compared in the two experiments with @xmath461 and @xmath462 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , one can carry out only one experiment with @xmath461 when comparing angular distributions in the upper- and in the lower semi - spaces .",
    "the numerical estimate ( [ aestim ] ) stays valid .",
    "since for such a study we need vortex electrons with the azimuthally asymmetric profiles , we would also like to find such states for which the requirement of a non - vanishing transverse momentum can be relaxed .    as can be readily seen , it is the case for airy states as their azimuthal distribution itself is highly asymmetric . for collision of two such beams with @xmath446 , the phases @xmath463 ( see eq.([psid ] ) ) , and the opposite signs of their parameters @xmath464 , we find : @xmath465 where we have used @xmath466 .",
    "the typical values of @xmath467 follow from the factor @xmath468 in the probability formula : see eq.([airymax ] ) . in any case , this yields the same @xmath469 factor in the asymmetry as in eq.([eq6 ] ) and @xmath361 for relativistic elastic scattering .",
    "therefore the use of airy beams leads to the very same predictions for the asymmetry as in the previous examples .",
    "moreover , one could think of such a phase @xmath81 that maximizes the asymmetry . within the paraxial case with @xmath470 ,",
    "however , the phases are limited by ineq.([phaseineq ] ) . that is why the asymmetry stays @xmath471 for all the other types of non - plane - wave states as well .",
    "the idea of using vortex states for probing the amplitude s phase was put forward by ivanov @xcite . by analogy with his work ,",
    "let us consider now scattering of a light particle by a heave one ( say , @xmath472 ) with @xmath473 . working in a frame in which the longitudinal momentum of the heavy particle is zero , we assume the light one to be in the pure bessel state with @xmath474 .",
    "we obtain that the asymmetry , @xmath475 does not depend on the oam @xmath476 of the light particle and , compared to eq.([eq8 ] ) , it has an additional small factor @xmath477 , which is less than @xmath362 for available beams .",
    "this factor also appears for the airy beams when @xmath478 but @xmath479 .",
    "that is why the higher values of the asymmetry favor the case with @xmath480 , in accordance with the ref.@xcite .",
    "the difference between the two methods described above can be elucidated by comparing two ways of colliding two rubber balls .",
    "if the balls are pumped up well , they are azimuthally symmetric and in order to violate this symmetry in scattering we need to collide them slightly off - center .",
    "conversely , when the balls are deflated they are most likely no longer azimuthally symmetric and that is why they can collide even at a zero impact parameter .",
    "one simply needs to imagine a wave packet with a non - trivial wave front instead of such a deflated ball .",
    "concluding , scattering experiments probing the coulomb phase , albeit being on the frontiers of technology , can be carried out at the modern electron microscopes , both with the gaussian beams and with the vortex- and/or airy ones if they are focused to a spot of the order of or less than @xmath423 in diameter .",
    "predictions for the hadronic ( or relative ) phase are less encouraging and inevitability model - dependent .",
    "describing detected states as plane waves , we lose the information about all the other quantum numbers the evolved state may possess per se .",
    "the simplest example here is a compton back - scattering of an optical twisted photon by an ultra - relativistic plane - wave electron @xcite . in this case",
    ", one may use an orthonormal set of bessel beams for describing the outgoing particles , which can be treated as entangled in their oam @xcite .    bearing this in mind ,",
    "let us choose now two out - states as the pure bessel ones with the oam @xmath481 and @xmath482 , and the wigner functions from eq.([wbess ] ) .",
    "both the incoming particles are still described with the gaussian wave packets ( [ wgaussa ] ) which can be later generalized to possess complex phases . for the sake of simplicity , we shall quantize both the final oam relative to the same z - axis , which means that the scattering angles should be smaller than the momentum s conical angles .",
    "generalization for the case with the so - called orbital helicity @xcite is straightforward when the final states are also described as wave packets rather than as the idealized bessel states .",
    "this problem , however , requires tedious calculations and will be tackled elsewhere .",
    "we shall also stick to the model with @xmath207 throughout this section .",
    "the integration measure for the final states in the probability formula ( [ m4 ] ) can be chosen as follows ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath483 at this point an important remark is in order . using the detected non - plane - wave states with a definite set of quantum numbers , we imply that there exists an appropriate detector , which is sensitive to this set . for twisted photons , an oam - sensitive `` detector '' may be thought of as a combination of a computer - generated hologram projecting the twisted state back onto the fundamental mode with @xmath484 , a mono - mode fiber , and a `` usual '' detector  a setup routinely used in quantum optics with the parametric down - converted twisted photons ( see , for example , @xcite ) . for electrons and other massive vortex particles , an analogous registration scheme may also include a pair of appropriate holograms and a ccd camera .",
    "let us now derive a probability formula analogous to eqs.([mapp]),([eq6alt ] ) but with the final bessel states .",
    "first we find the following relation for the wigner function ( [ wbess ] ) : @xmath485\\right ) \\",

    "now we return to eq.([m4 ] ) , integrate over @xmath489 and @xmath490 , and then , similar to the procedure employed in the previous sections , we make an expansion of @xmath491 over the small @xmath492 .",

    "it must be noted , however , that the last effect takes place solely because of the non - normalizable nature of pure bessel beams .",
    "if we had used the well - normalized wave packets with the oam ( [ wgaussoam ] ) instead , we would have come to @xmath503 in the leading order , as in eq.([mapp ] ) .",
    "if we sum over all the final oam , the resultant expression no longer has these features and looks very similar to eq.([mapp ] ) : @xmath504 the integrals over @xmath505 can be evaluated with the use of the following identity ( see eq.([xi ] ) ) : @xmath506    as can be readily checked , the final ( evolved ) state of two vortex particles is non - separable , @xmath507 and therefore oam - entangled .",
    "indeed , in the idealized transition from a two - particle bessel state @xmath508 to @xmath509 , the evolved one reads : @xmath510 where @xmath511 is the scattering amplitude .",
    "these states obviously do not factorize , @xmath512 an alternative criterion of entanglement is non - factorization of the probability ( [ mappbess ] ) ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) : @xmath513 where @xmath514 . a quantitative estimate of the oam entanglement ( or degree thereof )",
    "can be obtained by using the following entanglement measure @xcite : @xmath515 which varies from @xmath516 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath517 ( maximum entanglement ) and it is obviously finite in our case .",
    "note that the final bessel states are monochromatic : they posses definite energy but undetermined azimuthal component of the momentum @xmath518 , according to the angular momentum - angle uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "the oam - entanglement appears because the azimuthal components of the wave functions do not factorize in @xmath519 , that is , as a result of @xmath518-interference .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that this happens only when both the incoming states are described with the well - normalized wave packets . indeed , even if the in - states have no oam whatsoever , their _ oam spectra _ are finite ( see , for example , @xcite ) and , as a result , there is some overlap between both the azimuthal distributions .",
    "it is precisely this overlap that makes the final state a coherent superposition of the one - particle ones and the entanglement measure ( [ en8 ] ) finite .",
    "we have developed the relativistic scattering theory beyond the plane - wave approximation in the paraxial regime when the incoming packets are narrow in the momentum space .",
    "the wigner formalism turns out , therefore , to be the rather powerful tool that allows one to study effects accessible neither in the plane - wave approximation nor in the quasi - classical regime . among them",
    "is dependence of the observables upon phases of the incoming states and on the phase of the scattering amplitude .",
    "these effects are brought about by the finite overlap of the incoming wave packets .",
    "depending on the phases , the packets represent the coherent states , the vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum , the airy beams , as well as their various generalizations .",
    "we have derived the general model - independent expressions for the probability and for the cross section and , when the non - plane - wave effects are small , have also obtained the analytical formulas for the first corrections to the plane - wave results .    the wigner formalism is alternative and complementary to such well - developed quasi - classical methods as the trajectory - coherent approach with @xmath520 being the small parameter @xcite or the operator method in which the ultrarelativistic motion is also implied @xcite .",
    "neither of these approaches has an advantage of explicit lorentz invariance , although covariant generalization of the gaussian wave packets seems to be feasible @xcite .    in the paraxial regime",
    "the non - plane - wave corrections can alter the ( plane - wave ) cross section up to about @xmath521 ; the most compelling effect , however , appears to be the one of the amplitude s phase .",
    "when this phase is non - vanishing , the up - down symmetry of the angular distributions in scattering of two identical beams can be violated .",
    "we have discussed two methods for probing this violation in experiments either with the conventional gaussian beams or with such novel states as the vortex particles and the airy beams . for coulomb phase ,",
    "the corresponding effects are higher than @xmath522 for beams of the modern electron microscopes with the energies of hundreds of kev .",
    "as we have also demonstrated , in elastic scattering of two particles at least one of which carries oam the final pair gets oam - entangled .",
    "in addition to the standard optical technique of the parametric down conversion , such a scattering ( or annihilation ) could become another method for obtaining the oam - entangled beams , not only of photons but of the massive particles ( say , hadrons ) as well .",
    "the same procedure can also be applied to other non - plane - wave beams .",
    "it is of general interest , therefore , to generalize these results when the final states also represent wave packets with phases .",
    "this implies that they are detected with the appropriate apparatus and localized spatially as well as temporarily .",
