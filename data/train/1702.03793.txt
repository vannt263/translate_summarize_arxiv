    "quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit to the speed of quantum evolution , conventionally known as quantum speed limit time which is the minimum evolution time for a quantum state to become a different state .",
    "the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) plays an important role in many areas of quantum physics , such as quantum computation @xmath0 , quantum metrology [ 3 - 5 ] , optimal control @xmath1 and quantum communication @xmath2 . for closed systems , two types of quantum speed limit time bound",
    "have been derived : the mandelstam - tamm ( mt ) bound @xmath3 @xmath4 and margolus - levitin @xmath5 bounds @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the variance of energy and @xmath8 its average with respect to the ground state .",
    "both the mandelstamm - tamm and margolus - levitin bounds are attainable in closed quantum systems for initial pure states .",
    "since any system is inevitable subjected to an environment , quantum speed limit time bound for open quantum systems is highly desirable .",
    "taddei @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 extended the mandelstamm - tamm type bound to both unitary and nonunitary processes described by positive non - unitary maps by using of quantum fisher information for time estimation .",
    "later deffner and lutz @xmath12 extended both mandelstamm - tamm and margolus - levitin bounds for nonunitary evolution of open quantum system by using the geometric approach which provided by the bures angle @xmath13 .",
    "however this bound is attainable for initially pure states and it is not feasible for mixed states . the qsl time bound for both pure and mixed initial states",
    "has been derived by employing the relative purity @xmath14 and different types of alternative fidelity @xmath15 .",
    "they showed that the non - markovian effects can speed up quantum evolution and subsequently leads to smaller quantum speed limit time .",
    "recently , the authors in ref .",
    "@xmath16 showed that the existence of bound states between system and environment is the essential reason for the quantum speed up .",
    "they explored the mechanism of quantum speedup in a dissipative two - level system and revealed that the bound state of the system plays a decisive role in quantum speedup .    in this paper",
    "we investigate generation of system - environment bound states only by adding non - interacting qubits into the reservoir without manipulating the spectral density of the environment .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath17 non - interacting qubits in a dissipative common reservoir and reveal that , increasing @xmath17 leads to the stronger bound states between system and environment .",
    "also our results suggests that the stronger bound states which are provided by adding @xmath18 non - interacting qubits , can accelerate the quantum evolution of a single - qubit system .",
    "thus , we conclude that increasing the number of additional qubits play an essential role in the speeding up of the evolution of a given single - qubit .    the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model of @xmath17 non - interacting qubits in a common zero - temperature reservoir is introduced and the dynamics of this system is studied . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the condition for the formation of bound states between the qubits and the related reservoir by exploring the eigen - spectrum of the model .",
    "iv is devoted to derive a qsl time bound for a given single - qubit in this system . in sec .",
    "v the qsl time for a given single qubit in lorentzian spectral density and ohmic spectral density reservoirs is studied .",
    "finally , the paper is ended by a brief conclusion .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath17 non - interacting qubits ( two - level atoms ) involved in a common zero - temperature thermal reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22 is the raising ( lowering ) operator of the @xmath23 qubit with transition frequency @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath27 field mode with frequency @xmath28 .",
    "also , the strength of coupling between the @xmath23 qubit and the @xmath27 field mode is represented by @xmath29 .",
    "we work in the interaction picture where the schrodinger equation is written as @xmath30 and the hamiltonian in this picture is given by @xmath31 we can immediately see that the total hamiltonian commutes with the number of excitations @xmath32=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , by considering only one excitation in the whole system at the initial time as @xmath33 and using the eq .",
    "4 , the total system evolves after time @xmath34 into the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 , which means all of the qubits are in the ground state @xmath37 except the @xmath23 qubit that is in the excited state @xmath38 and we have @xmath39 . also , we denote @xmath40 being the vacuum state of the reservoir and @xmath41 the state of it with only one excitation in the @xmath42th field mode .",
    "it is clear that @xmath43 , then we have @xmath44 and the other probability amplitudes gives by the following integro - differential equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the correlation function @xmath47 is related to the spectral density @xmath48 of the reservoir by @xmath49 the exact form of @xmath50 thus depends on the particular choice for the spectral density of the reservoir .",
    "the energy spectrum of the discussed model in the previous section can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in eq . 1 and eq . 8 , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we assume that @xmath54=0 , therefore , substituting eq . 1 and eq . 8 into eq",
    ". 11 , yields the following set of @xmath55 equations @xmath56 obtaining @xmath57 from the first equation and substituting it to the rest equations gives the following @xmath17 integro - differential equations @xmath58    by combining the above equations and eliminating the amplitude coefficients , we can obtain the following restricted equation @xmath59 the solution of eq .",
    "14 highly depends on the particular choice for the spectral density of the reservoir . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xmath60 , the existence of a bound state requires that eq .",
    "14 has at least a real solution for @xmath61 .",
    "it can be easily checked that the solution of eq .",
    "14 always exists by satisfying the condition @xmath62 , otherwise , there exist no bound state . in the other hand , it has only complex solutions when a bound state is not formed .",
    "this means that the corresponding eigenstate experiences decay from the imaginary part of the eigenvalue during the time evolution and therefore the excited - state population approaches to zero asymptotically .",
    "but if a bound state is formed , the population of the atomic excited state in the bound state is constant in time because it has a vanishing decay rate during the time evolution .",
    "in ref . [ 4 ] defnner and lutz derived margolus - levitin bound for initially pure states @xmath63 by exploiting the von neumann trace inequality and operator norm .",
    "the basis of approach is provided by the bures angle @xmath64 between initial and the target state @xmath65 , @xmath66 the time derivative on the bures angle leads to the relation @xmath67 the arbitrary time - dependent nonunitary equation has the form @xmath68 and by substituting it in ( 16 ) , we have @xmath69 by exploiting von neumann trace inequality and integrating eq .",
    "17 over time , the margolus - levitin quantum speed limit bound for open quantum systems has the form @xmath70}{\\lambda^{op}_{t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the operator norm of matrix .",
    "we can obtain the quantum speed limit bound for the initial state @xmath73 as    @xmath74    where @xmath75 can be calculated from eq . 9 and depends on the particular choice for the spectral density of the reservoir .",
    "we first take a lorentzian spectral density for the reservoir as @xmath76 where the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 define the spectral width of the coupling and the coupling constant between the system and the reservoir , respectively .",
    "now , we investigate the effect of additional qubits on the formation of bound states with the lorentzian reservoir .",
    "unfortunately , we can not obtain an analytical criterion for the existence of a bound state ( eq .",
    "14 ) with the lorentzian spectrum , therefore it is studied numerically , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) . as an interesting result",
    ", we observe that increasing @xmath17 leads to the stronger system - environment bound states . also , it is clear that the bound state is formed after a critical coupling constant which is smaller for the reservoir with the more additional qubits .    in the following ,",
    "we want to obtain the qsl time ( eq .",
    "20 ) of a single - qubit system with the lorentzian spectral density , so that we need to find the probability amplitude @xmath50 for the @xmath23 qubit which is our discussed single - qubit system .",
    "to this aim , we assume that there is no excitation in the qubits except the @xmath23 qubit at the initial time , i. e. @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "now , by substituting the above lorentzian spectral density in the eq . 9 and eq .",
    "10 , we can obtain the exact solution of the probability amplitude @xmath50 by using the laplace transform    @xmath81    where @xmath82 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the @xmath23 qubit can be obtained after tracing out the zero - temperature thermal reservoir and the qubits except @xmath23 one .",
    "so , in the basis @xmath83 , we have @xmath84    we guess that the formation of the bound state of the total system is essential reason for accelerating the quantum evolution . therefore , we consider @xmath85 as the initial state and plot the qsl time of @xmath86 versus the coupling constant @xmath78 with the lorentzian spectrum , as depicted in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "it is obvious that as the number of additional qubits in the reservoir grows up , then the lower bound of the qsl time is decreased , which means that the single - qubit system evolve with more speed by increasing the number of additional qubits .",
    "also , we observe that the quantum speedup connects directly with the formation of the bound states . in the other hand , the formation of the bound states via additional qubits leads to the quantum evolution with more speed .      to making a comparative study and confirming our obtained results for the lorentzian spectral density",
    ", we consider the ohmic spectral density as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the cut - off frequency and @xmath89 is a dimensionless coupling constant .    as discussed in section iii , a bound state is formed if the condition @xmath62 is satisfied , therefore , for the ohmic spectral density we have @xmath90 this condition can be obtained easily by controlling the number of additional qubits . it is interesting to note that , as @xmath91 , the critical point of @xmath92 reaches to zero , so there are no restrictions on the formation of the bound states . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the energy spectrum of the formed bound states with the ohmic spectral density has been plotted .",
    "similar to the lorentzian spectral density , we observe that increasing the number of additional qubits leads to the stronger system - environment bound states . unfortunately , in contrast to the lorentzian spectral density , there is no analytical solution for the closed integro - differential equation ( eq . 9 )",
    "and thus we must obtain the qsl time numerically .",
    "we assume that @xmath85 is the initial state and plot the qsl time of @xmath86 versus the @xmath89 with the ohmic spectrum , as depicted in fig .",
    "by comparing the obtained results in fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) , we conclude that the system has a great capacity to speed up when it is bounded .",
    "in summary , the mechanism of quantum speedup in a single qubit system have been explored on the basis of creating bound state for the system and environment by using non - interacting additional qubits . as observed for the reservoir with different spectral density , creating system - reservoir bound state with higher degree of boundedness",
    "is provided by inserting more additional qubits .",
