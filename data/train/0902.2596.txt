    "control of quantum processes has attracted considerable attention , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "most studies of quantum control are concerned with shaping a laser pulse to achieve an expected goal . however , a coherent laser pulse is not the only driving force for quantum dynamics .",
    "incoherent driving forces , such as laser noise , decoherence from the environment , and quantum observations , can also influence quantum dynamics .",
    "a natural general expectation is that the later influence will be deleterious toward achieving control  @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite have shown that controlled quantum dynamics can survive intense field noise and decoherence , as well as even cooperate with them under special circumstances  @xcite . under these special conditions , it is possible to meet the target goal more effectively with the help of laser noise and environmental decoherence .",
    "incoherent non - unitary control of quantum systems by a suitably optimized environment ( e.g. , incoherent radiation , a gas or solvent , a cloud of electrons , atoms or molecules , etc . ) was suggested as a supplement to coherent control to provide a general tool for selective manipulation of both the hamiltonian and dissipative aspects of the system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "both the outcome and back - action from quantum measurements could be used to control quantum processes . in standard",
    "closed - loop optimal control  @xcite , the quantum system is non - selectively measured when the desired evolution ends , and the outcomes of the measurements are used by a learning algorithm to optimize the laser pulse .",
    "measurements were also used to map an unknown mixed state onto a known target pure state  @xcite .",
    "some investigations considered exploiting the back action from the quantum observations , and control by measurement plus dynamical evolution was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the control of the population branching ratio between two degenerate states by continuous measurements was treated  @xcite , and the effect of nonoptimized measurements on control by lasers was investigated  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed to investigate observations serving as indirect controls in the manipulation of quantum dynamics  @xcite .",
    "optimal control fields were shown to be capable of cooperating or fighting with observations to achieve a good yield , and the nature of the observations may be optimized to more effectively control the quantum dynamics .",
    "quantum observations also can break dynamical symmetries to increase the controllability of a quantum system .",
    "the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects induced by observations are the key operating principles in these processes",
    ". when instantaneous observations are the only forces to drive population transfer in a two - level system , the maximal population transfer induced by a finite number of measurements has been found , and the quantum anti - zeno effect is recovered in the limit of infinitely frequent measurements  @xcite .    in this paper , we further explore the utility of quantum measurements as controls in the manipulation of quantum dynamics .",
    "here we assume that any projection operator may be observed in a suitably performed experiment .",
    "analytical solutions and upper bounds of several controlled processes are found .",

    "quantum measurement serves as an incoherent driving force , and there are two general types of quantum measurements : instantaneous von neumann measurements and continuous measurements .",
    "a characteristic feature of quantum systems is that their measurement unavoidably affects the associated dynamics .",

    "density matrices are adopted to describe the states of controlled systems , because the nonselective quantum measurements in the paper are applied to an ensemble of quantum systems .",
    "an ideal measurement occurs at one instant of time or a sequence of such observations may be performed at different instants  @xcite .",
