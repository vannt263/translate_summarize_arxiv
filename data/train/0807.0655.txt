    "the eigenfunction will not be square integrable unless the otherwise infinite series in equation ( [ eq : ho_series ] ) becomes a polynomial , which occurs when @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "the brief discussion given above has the sole purpose of calling the reader s attention on the close relationship between the correct asymptotic behaviour of the solution of the schrdinger equation at @xmath37 and the allowed values of the energy , as well as on the fact that @xmath38 is a rational function , analytic at origin , and can be expanded in a taylor series : @xmath39",
    "suppose that we do not know the allowed values of the energy of the harmonic oscillator and consider the regularized logarithmic derivative of the eigenfunction @xmath40 that satisfies the riccati equation @xmath41 where the last term vanishes because @xmath24 or @xmath25 as discussed earlier . in order to derive this expression",
    "we simply differentiate @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 and use equations ( [ eq : schro_ho ] ) and ( [ eq : f(x ) ] ) to get rid of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "we do not expect to obtain exact eigenvalues for the general anharmonic oscillator as we have already done for the harmonic one , but at least we do expect that the roots of the hankel determinants will enable us to estimate the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : aho_schro ] ) .",

    "in the case of the harmonic oscillator we saw that the multiplicity of each root increases with the determinant dimension .",

    "we thus expect sequences of roots of the hankel determinant converging towards @xmath133 and @xmath134@xcite .    table  [ tab : spurious ] shows them for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this example is greatly revealing because the asymptotic behaviour of the bound  state eigenfunctions of the first model ( [ eq : v_mod_pt ] ) is @xmath137 , whereas for the second one ( [ eq : v_pt ] ) the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath138 are determined by the poles of the potential  energy function ( [ eq : v_pt ] ) at @xmath139 .",
    "we appreciate that the rpm yields solutions to two models with quite different boundary conditions simultaneously .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the fact that the rpm does not take the boundary conditions explicitly into account as discussed earlier in sec .",
    "[ sec : rpmho ] .",
    "once we have a sufficiently accurate eigenvalue we obtain the coefficients @xmath47 and the rational approximation ( [ eq:[m / n](z ) ] ) to @xmath42 .",

    "we simply apply the rpm to the anharmonic oscillator with potential  energy function @xmath151 and obtain @xmath152 .",

    "we obtain similar results for the first excited state .",
    "the rate of convergence of the rpm bounds is considerably greater to that of the moment method@xcite .",

    "introductory communication we have restricted to one  dimensional models with symmetric ( even  parity ) potential  energy functions . the generalization to other cases is straightforward and will be discussed in subsequent articles .",
    "this presentation appears rather mathematical at first sight , but one must keep in mind that the schrdinger equation for anharmonic oscillators have many applications in the study of , for example , oscillatory phenomena@xcite . therefore , the rpm may be of practical utility in such studies , particularly because its remarkable rate of convergence enables one to obtain accurate results easily .",
    "we would not say that the rpm is the best choice for all possible applications , but it is worth taking into consideration that it does not require the calculation of matrix elements which may be difficult for some potentials and only requires their taylor expansions . besides , in some cases , like the anharmonic oscillator ( [ eq : v_x2_x4 ] ) , the rpm yields simple implicit equations that are reasonably accurate for all values of the potential parameters .    but the main purpose of this paper is to discuss an approximate method that does not share many features with those presented in standard textbooks on quantum chemistry and quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "it is those peculiar features of the rpm that in our opinion could make it most interesting for students with some knowledge in mathematics and physics . in particular , the rpm is suitable for training students in the use of cas that facilitate most of the required algebra and analysis .",
