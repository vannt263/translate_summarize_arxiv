    "many gregarious vertebrates are fusion - fission species , with frequent changes in size and composition of groups . in addition , the habitat they live in is generally heterogeneous , such that individuals alone or in groups may have to move among more or less distant areas in order to fulfil their basic vital requirements , e.g. drinking , resting or avoiding pblackators @xcite . even during feeding periods , animals have to search for available food , moving slowly and on short distances between feeding stations or more rapidly and on larger distances to exploit distinct feeding areas @xcite .",
    "thus , groups either resting or feeding with animals motionless or moving slowly are frequently joined by incoming individuals but also submitted to departures of group members @xcite . when faced to multiple choices",
    ", social organisms must reach consensus in order to maintain the cohesion of the group and the advantages linked to it @xcite .",
    "the departure of one or few individuals from static groups as well as stops in moving groups compromise social cohesion @xcite .",
    "this is particularly critical for small groups  a scenario that applies to most gregarious animals @xcite despite the popularity and fascination that produce giant bird flocks or fish schools @xcite  where group splitting represents a serious pblackatory risk @xcite .",
    "what influences the individual decisions , _",
    "i.e _ the interplay between external stimuli and internal state , and which decision - making processes occur to maintain social cohesion are among the most compelling questions in the study of collective animal behavior @xcite .",
    "this goes beyond biology and concerns the broader question of how information at the individual level is evaluated , processed and distributed in the group @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with primates and fish revealed that an individual spontaneously departing from a static group is likely to give up and return to the group when not followed @xcite .",
    "it has been also observed that collective motion is promoted by already moving conspecifics @xcite .",
    "finally , in some species , a quorum is requiblack to observe collective movement @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "how collective motion stops , remains largely unexploblack except for few exceptions @xcite . in summary , there is a lack of experimental and theoretical studies focusing on the decision - making processes that trigger and stop collective motion @xcite .    here",
    ", we use experimentally acquiblack data to address how groups of uninformed individuals respond to the departure and stop of an informed conspecific .",
    "we show that the groups of uninformed individuals always reach a consensus : either all uninformed individuals follow the informed one or none does it . combining experiments where we control the stimulus , associated to the motion of the informed individual , and a mathematical model we unveil that the apparent collective decision - making process leading to an effective consensus results from a self - organized phenomenon resulting from the interplay of simple mimetic rules and the characteristic duration of the stimulus , with group size playing a central role .",
    "fieldwork was carried out in the domaine du merle ( @xmath0 e , @xmath1 n ) in the south of france .",
    "the field station is located in the crau region , a very flat area coveblack by a native steppe .",
    "the experiments were performed within irrigated pastures providing homogeneous food resources . from the available flock of 1400 ewes , 30 of them",
    "were randomly selected and allocated to the training set and a further 200 ewes to the naive set .",
    "all ewes used were unrelated and were 3 to 5 year - old .",
    "a number was painted on the back and fleece of each sheep for identification .",
    "both sets were penned up in the same sheepfold during the evening and the night .",
    "all the experiments were carried out in daylight ( from 10 am to 6 pm ) and the ewes were fed hay in the sheepfold in the morning and in the evening .      the experiments rely on our capacity to trigger the movement of one sheep toward a fixed panel at the periphery of an arena at a desiblack time .",
    "the protocol used to trained sheep was similar to the one used in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "sheep to be trained were originally allocated at random in 6 groups of 5 animals which composition remained unchanged during the training period .",
    "sheep were first habituated in the sheepfold to feed on corn and to receive simultaneously a vibration provided by a neck collar during 3 days .",
    "then the training groups were introduced successively in one of two test arenas ( 50 x 50 m ) , for a period of 30 to 40 min , each animal wearing a vibrating collar .",
    "ten minutes past the introduction , the collar was activated and one yellow panel ( 0.5 x 0.5 m ) was simultaneously raised delivering a handful of corn .",
    "each group received four to eight stimulations , each separated by a period of at least 5 min during each training session .",
    "past 14 days of training , we selected the 3 sheep with the best learning scores ( 100% of departure toward the panel following a vibration ) .",
    "meanwhile , the set of naive sheep to be used in experiments was confronted to panel rising ( without corn delivery ) at the periphery of experimental arenas , at one - min interval during two sessions of 90 min . at the end of this habituation session ,",
    "no naive sheep raised its head when raising the panel .",
    "in addition , these two days allowed naive sheep to be familiarized with the experimental setup .      the experimental setup consisted in two arenas ( 50 x 50 m ) delimited with sheep fences and surrounded by a visual barrier ( propylene net ) .",
    "a 7m - high tower was placed at an equal distance ( 10 m ) apart from two next arenas corners .",
    "yellow panels ( 0.5 x 0.5 m ) were hammeblack in the middle of each side for both arenas and were not visible to sheep ( ) . the tests consisted in introducing groups of 8 , 16 or 32 sheep within one arena , among which one trained sheep equipped with a vibrating collar .",
    "the trained ewes were used no more than twice a day , but were implicated in all group sizes .",
    "the naive sheep that composed the rest of the groups were selected randomly for each test . because of the large number of individuals needed to complete all replications , the naive sheep were used several times , except in groups of 8 .",
    "thirty replications were performed for groups of 32 and 15 replications for groups of 8 and 16 individuals .",
    "a test was conducted as follows : the group was introduced in the arena and sheep grazed spontaneously during 20 min .",
    "then , one of the two panels closest to the tower was raised , waiting for all sheep grazing ( _ i.e _ head down ) .",
    "simultaneously the vibrating collar of the trained sheep was activated for 2 sec .",
    "past 10 min ( end of test ) , a new panel was raised ( one of the two farthest from the tower ) to reinforce the conditioning of trained ewes and avoid restricting their space use to the vicinity of panels closest to the tower .",
    "the group was led back to the sheepfold shortly afterward .",
    "the naive sheep that were not tested during one experimental day were introduced in distant pasture .",
    "we never performed two trials in parallel .",
    "we also carried out control experiments to be sure that naive ewes did not associate the panel rise and the food reward .",
    "thereby , 6 tests before and 6 after the test series were conducted with groups of 32 naive ewes , using the same protocol as described before .",
    "we found no movement of groups when raising the panel , almost all sheep continuing their spontaneous activity .",
    "two digital cameras ( canon eos d50 ) were fixed on the tower , each one focusing on one arena .",
    "fifteen minutes after the introduction of the groups , the digital camera was turned on , taking a picture of the entire arena every second and turned off five minutes after the panel was raised . for each replication",
    ", we obtained a series of about 600 pictures . using a custom software developed by jg",
    ", we were able to track on each picture the position and the orientation of animals by dragging a vector on their back , and identify the behavior of each individual , _",
    "i.e _ grazing , standing head - up , moving and others .",
    "we defined a departure of the trained sheep ( initiator ) , _",
    "i.e _ initiation past experimental stimulation when it performed an uninterrupted walk towards the raised panel .",
    "the following behavior , _",
    "i.e _ a new departure , was defined as the movement of a naive ewe occurring after the trained sheep departure , without stop until joining the trained ewe near the panel .",
    "the behavior of stopping was defined as an individual ceasing to walk and remains either stationary head - up or resumes grazing .",
    "six replication in the groups of 32 were discarded , one because the initiator did not depart , two because the initiator stopped moving between the group and the target and three because the initiator showed a moving behavior not comparable to other trials ( going to a wrong target first and then joining the rewarded target ) .",
    "thus we performed analyses on 15 trials for groups of 8 and 16 sheep and 24 trials for groups of 32 .",
    "the level @xmath2 was fixed to 0.05 for statistical significance .",
    "all analyses were conducted using r version 3.0.1 .",
    "all the animals were maintained under routine husbandry conditions at a montpellier supagro research station ( domaine du merle , salon - de - provence , france ) with full approval of its director pierre - marie bouquet .",
    "animal welfare requirements were fully respected in accordance with the european directive 2010/63/eu , with the rules of the european convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes and with the convention of the french comit national de rflexion thique sur lexprimentation animale .",
    "no special authorization from the french ethical committee for animal experimentation ( commission nationale de lexprimentation animale ) was requiblack as no protected or endangeblack species was involved , as the experiments did not imply any invasive manipulation ( the experimental protocol consists in the observation of groups and the acquiblack data are only pictures of the animals ) and as sheep were conducted to the test arenas , as they are herded on a daily basis to the pastures .",
    "all personnel involved had technical support from the employees of the research station as requiblack by the french ministry of research .",
    "the experimental protocols included short test periods ( 20 minutes ) where sheep did not experience painful , stressful or unfamiliar situations .",
    "the experimental procedures had no detrimental effect on the sheep and at the end of the experiment all the animals reintegrated the sheep herd of the breeding research station .",
    "in our experiments , we work with groups of n  =  8 , 16 and 32 sheep , among which 1 is a trained individual  henceforth referblack to as initiator  while the remaining n - 1 are uninformed / naive individuals .",
    "the initiator is trained to move towards a target located at the periphery of the arena when a vibrating collar is activated by a remote control ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "the group is subject to the perturbation produced by the initiator : _",
    "i.e. _ the sudden departure and stop of the initiator , which challenge the social cohesion of the group .",
    "when the departure of the initiator triggers a collective response , we observe three distinct consecutive phases : departing , collective motion , and stopping as illustrated in fig .",
    "the departing phase starts with the departure of the initiator and continues until the number n~m~ of moving individuals increases to match the group size . at this point ,",
    "the collective motion phase begins with the group moving cohesively behind the initiator .",
    "the stop of the initiator near the target marks the onset of the stopping phase , where n~m~ decreases until reaching 0 .",
    "the behavior of an individual can be characterized by one of the following states : stopped at the start position ( s~s~ ) , moving ( m ) , or stopped at the target position ( s~t~ ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . the whole process can be then described as a transition first from s~s~ to m , and then from m to s~t~.    in all trials with 8 and 16 sheep , the departure of the initiator systematically triggers a collective motion ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) . in groups of 32",
    "the departure of the initiator does not always leads to a collective motion of the naive group .",
    "splitting of the naive group has not been observed ( see and for examples . )    we start our analysis by focusing first on the cases where the initiator successfully provokes a collective motion .",
    "we are interested in quantifying the decision of sheep to switch from s~s~ to m and from m to s~t~. fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ( respectively , fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) shows that from from s~s~ to m ( in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , from m to s~t~ ) increases with n~m~ ( with n~s~t~~ , the number of individuals in state s~t~ , in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "[ fig2]b ( respectively , fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) indicates that the transition rate from s~s~ to m ( respectively , from m to s~t~ ) for a fixed value of n~m~ ( fixed value n~s~t~~ , for m @xmath3 s~t~ ) diminishes with n~s~s~~ ( n~m~ in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "this indicates that both transitions s~s~ @xmath3 m and m @xmath3 s~t~ share similar features : they both exhibit a promoting component ( n~m~ in s~s~ @xmath3 m and n~s~t~~ in m @xmath3 s~t~ ) and an inhibiting component ( n~s~s~~ in s~s~ @xmath3 m and n~m~ in m @xmath3 s~t~ ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies using smaller group sizes @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the departure of the initiator does not always trigger collective motion in groups of 32 individuals .",
    "importantly , the absence of collective follow is not related to a peculiar behavior of the initiator ( see for details ) .",
    "these observations suggest a social effect linked to group size ( _ i.e _ to the number of uninformed individuals ) . for groups with n  =  32 , the uninformed individuals , upon departure of the initiator , respond in an all - or - none way : either all follow the initiator or none of them does it , and thus no fission of the naive group is observed .",
    "this phenomenon , which seems at first glance to require some sort of concertation among the naive individuals , can be understood by focusing on the behavior of the first potential follower .",
    "our argument is based on the assumption that the initiator can stimulate a transition s~s~ @xmath4 m only when moving to the target position , _",
    "i.e. _ while being in state m. this implies that if no naive sheep departs by the time the initiator reaches the target , no transition s~s~ @xmath3 m will ever occur . in consequence , the probability p~s~ that the initiator is still moving at time t provides a rough estimate of the probability that the stimulation is still present .",
    "all this means that the problem can be blackuced to the competition between two probabilities : p~s~ and the probability p~f~ that the first follower departs before time t , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a - c .",
    "[ fig3]a and b indicate that for n  =  8 and 16 , the transition s~s~ @xmath3 m for the first followers always occurs before the initiator stops near the target position .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig3]c shows that the transition s~s~ @xmath3 m for the first follower is such that the initiator can stop at the target position before this transition has ever occurblack .",
    "this provides a qualitative explanation of the remarkable group size effects observed in the experiments .",
    "now , we go further in the quantitative analysis using a mathematical model , which has proved useful to analyze the experimental data and to test the various hypotheses formulated to interpret the observed phenomena . in particular",
    ", we will see that ( i ) the departure and stop rates can be expressed as non - linear functions , with promoting and inhibiting components as proposed above , and ( ii ) that the hypothesis that the initiator can only induce a transition s~s~ @xmath3 m while being in state m is consistent with the experimental data . our first step is to formulate the ( individual ) rate @xmath5 associated to the transition s~s~ @xmath3 m as : @xmath6    with @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters modulating the effect of n~s~s~~ and n~m~ on @xmath5 .",
    "notice that for simplicity we have assumed that every individual is able to perceive all individuals in the group .",
    "this implies that each individual has a global perception of the group , that is a reasonable hypothesis for small groups of up to few dozens of individuals , but that becomes unrealistic in large herds with hundblacks of animals .",
    "given expression , we can compute the mean time to depart t(n~m~ ) for the n~m~^th^ follower as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the departure transition rate at the group level . from the inverse function of this expression",
    "we obtain n~m~ as a function of time ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]e ) , _ i.e. _ from t(n~m~ ) we obtain n~m~(t ) .",
    "notice that the departing phase is then given by @xmath11 , which means that the average collective motion phase is approximately @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time requiblack by the initiator to reach the target ( see ) .",
    "in analogy to equation , we assume that the ( individual ) stop rate @xmath14 , related to the transition from m @xmath3 s~t~ , is given by @xmath15    with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters modulating the effect of n~m~ and n~s~t~~ on @xmath14 . during the stopping phase , n~m~(t ) ) is obtained from the inverse function of @xmath19 with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .    as commented above",
    ", it can occur that uninformed individuals do not follow the initiator in groups of n  =  32 . using the proposed mathematical framework ,",
    "we can account for such group size effect .",
    "we recall that the absence of collective motion is associated with those situations where the initiator does not induce any transition s~s~ @xmath3 m of a naive individual during the time @xmath13 requiblack by the initiator to reach the target position .",
    "mathematically , the problem blackuces to compute the probability c  henceforth referblack to as _ commitment _  to observe a transition s~s~ @xmath3 m of a naive individual during @xmath13 , which takes the form : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , i the number of initiators ( i  =  1 in our experiments ) and @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the minimum and maximum observed @xmath13 values respectively ( see for the derivation of expression ) .",
    "the estimation of parameters is done in two steps .",
    "the best fit of eq .   to the experimental points in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d provides a set of @xmath2 and @xmath8 values .",
    "fixing these two parameters , the best fit on the individual rates is used to estimate the other parameter .",
    "more details on the fitting procedure are given in .",
    "the obtained values are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . fig .",
    "[ fig3]e shows that the dynamics resulting from equations and provides a qualitative description of the data ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig1]a ) , while fig .",
    "[ fig3]d shows that the model also accounts for the experimentally observed commitment c. it worth noticing that given the nonlinear form of the transition rates and given the obtained parameter values , it turns out that after a first transition s~s~ @xmath3 m of a naive individual , a cascade of transitions s~s~ @xmath3 m will immediately follow .",
    "the mathematical model allows exploring a large variety of hypothetical scenarios using conditions going beyond the ones used experimentally .",
    "it is important to stress that model pblackictions are reliable as long as all hypotheses and assumptions remain valid .",
    "ultimately , models pblackictions should be verified / falsified by performing further experiments . always according to our mathematical model ,",
    "there exist three possible outcomes when the naive group faces the departure of one or more initiators : i ) all naive individuals follow the initiator(s ) , ii ) none of them does it , and iii ) only a fraction of naive individuals follow the initiator(s ) . the associated probabilities , p~af~ for i ) , p~nf~ for ii ) , and p~gs~ for iii ) ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . while the first two scenarios , _",
    "i.e. _ i ) and ii ) , imply a sort of consensus for the naive group , which assures group cohesion , the third scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ iii ) , implies group fission .",
    "although according to the mathematical model group splitting can occur , its probability is always small .",
    "[ fig4]a shows that in groups of @xmath32 , the probability of observing group splitting is smaller than 5% .",
    "given that with n  =  32 we have performed @xmath33 experimental trials , one could expect in mean one group splitting event . in short ,",
    "the experimental observations are consistent with model pblackictions .",
    "in addition , the model pblackicts - for a fixed range of @xmath13 ( _ i.e. _ stimulation duration ) - that full collective motion decreases non linearly with group size n , while the probability p~nf~ that none follows increases non linearly ( black and black curves , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "the probability of observing splitting of the naive group ( green curve ) exhibits a non monotonic dependency with n with a maximum at n  =  64 , where the probability is close to 20% .",
    "this means that by performing similar experiments with @xmath34 naive individuals and one initiator - and performing a similar number of replications of the experiment - we should be able to observe group fission .",
    "it is worth noticing that if the group size is larger than @xmath35 , the probability of splitting decreases again .",
    "furthermore , the model pblackicts that for large group sizes the departure of the initiator can not induce naive individuals to move towards the target position : for large values of @xmath36 the naive group remains unresponsive to the departure of the initiator .",
    "this observation is , however , only valid for a fixed range of @xmath13 .",
    "if we imagine that the experiment is performed in larger arenas , in such a way that the target position is located farther away and @xmath13 is significantly larger , the departure of the initiator will again lead naive individuals to move towards the target ( fig .  [",
    "moreover , if the @xmath13 is large enough , the model pblackicts that the only possible outcome upon the departure of the initiator is a full collective follow .",
    "accordingly , the only scenario where fission of the naive group can be observed is when the two resulting subgroups will be separated a relatively small distance one from the other , at which point we could ask ourselves whether such separation qualifies truly as group splitting .",
    "these experimental and theoretical results are in full agreement with very recent findings showing that in animal groups , the persistence of the stimulus ( the behaviour of one or several initiators ) in time is a crucial parameter to trigger a consensus to either turn or depart cohesively @xcite",
    ". this stimulus duration might be dependent of the travelled distance as shown in our results but also of the velocity of the initiator that is known to be a factor influencing group decisions @xcite .",
    "finally , the model also allows us to explore situations where naive groups are subject to conflicting information cues .",
    "for instance , let us imagine we trained a group of i individuals to move towards the target position and a group of r individuals to stay at the starting position .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the naive individuals , for whom there are always two mutually exclusive options  either to stay or to go  , which means that all probabilities , p~af~ , p~nf~ , and p~gs~ , are computed with respect to the naive group .",
    "to avoid confusions , we clarify that this implies that p~af~ is the probability that all naive individuals follow , p~nf~ none of the naive individuals follows , and p~gs~ the probability that at the end of the process we find some of the naive individuals at the starting position and some at the target position .",
    "we start out with a simple scenario where there is no trained individual to stay , _",
    "i.e. _ r  =  0 . by increasing the number i of individuals moving away ,",
    "we find , not surprisingly , that p~af~ increases dramatically , to the point that the only possible outcome is a collective motion ( _ i.e. _ p~af~ @xmath4 1 , fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) .",
    "similarly , we can fix i and increase the number r of individuals determined to stay .",
    "we find that increasing r leads to a very weak increase of p~nf~ and p~gs~ ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]e ) .",
    "thus , there is a clear asymmetry in the role played by i and r. this is particularly evident by fixing the number of trained individuals and varying the relative weight between i and r. fig .",
    "[ fig4]d corresponds to i + r  =  3 and shows that i  =  1 and r  =  2 is remarkably different from i  =  2 and r  =  1 . in particular , while for i  =  2 and r  =  1 , p~af~ @xmath4 1 , for i  =  1 and r  =  2 , we do not find that p~nf~ @xmath4 1 .",
    "i  =  1 and r  =  2 differs only slightly from i  =  1 and r  =  0 .",
    "this means that if we have initially i  =  1 and r  =  1 , adding an extra trained individual determined to move towards the target ensures a full collective follow , while adding an extra individual determined to stay has a very weak effect on the collective outcome .",
    "we have to make r close to n to assure that the trained individual will systematically fail to recruit any naive sheep . in short , a small variation of r has a weaker effect than a small variation of i. adding individuals determined to either stay or to leave does not produce , at the collective level , a symmetric bias , this is in sharp contrast with binary decision studies  @xcite where mutually exclusive options are consideblack as symmetric .",
    "this is particularly clear in flocking models @xcite where left - right choices are such that individuals determined to move towards the left exert the same social influence than individuals determined to move towards the right .",
    "one important message we learn is that opposite alternatives are not necessarily symmetric .",
    "the origin of such asymmetry may be related to the fact that at the individual level the decision whether to stay or to leave can be formulated as a decision whether to remain in the current state or to change it .",
    "the obtained results , at both the experimental and theoretical level , suggest that _ behavioral change _ is strongly favoblack .",
    "moreover , it seems that the individuals that initiate a change become  as previously proposed  @xcite  incidental leaders , while those determined to remain in the current state , though playing an inhibiting role , exert a weaker influence on the naive group .",
    "here , we have shown that simple mimetic responses  as those described by equations and  when combined with the characteristic duration associated to the stimulus  here , the time requiblack to arrive at the target position  act as an effective collective decision - making mechanism .",
    "moreover , we showed that the proposed mechanism , whose derivation is intimately based on the presented experimental observations , allows a group of naive / uninformed individuals to solve a scenario with conflicting information in such a way that the most probable collective outcome is a consensus .",
    "specifically , we analyzed a situation where the naive group faces a scenario where there is a subgroup decided to stay and subgroup decided to go , and showed that the two most probable outcome are that either all naive individuals follow or none does .",
    "importantly , though group splitting can not be discarded , such event is , according to the proposed mechanism , unlikely .    in summary",
    ", the interplay between mimetic rules and the characteristic duration of the stimulus leads to a self - organized collective decision - making that does not requiblack neither explicit communication nor concertation among the group members .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the effective decision - making mechanism described here applies to a specific social context : a group of nave individuals sharing an initial behavioral state , which is subject to the behavioral shift of one or several conspecifics .",
    "one of the essential elements of the proposed mechanism is the presence of a discrete number of behavioral states , which has to be , necessarily , larger than two ( as _ e.g. _ s~s~ , m and s~t~ ) .",
    "this means that collective decision - making models for groups in motion , where the group has to decide in which direction to move @xcite can not be used to model the specific social context addressed here .",
    "such models have been designed to describe the navigation of a group , and not to describe behavioral shifts . at the mathematical level",
    "the differences are evident . while navigation models associate a continuous variable to each individual , related to the moving direction of the individual , behavioral shift models deal with discrete variables associated to the possible behavioral states of the group members .",
    "similarly , the social mechanism analyzed here can not be directly compablack with decision - making models designed to described dichotomic decisions as left and right moving direction @xcite .",
    "the essential difference with such models is that .",
    "in contrast to the social context we are interested in here where individuals initially share same behavioral state . in summary , the collective decision - making mechanism proposed here is fundamentally different , and not comparable to previous collective decision - making mechanisms , which have been designed to describe a different social context .",
    "deeply rooted in the models proposed in previous works @xcite , the mechanism proposed here differs from these two by making use of three behavioral states , accounting simultaneously for the initiation and stop of the collective response , and with both processes modeled as a transition at the individual level .",
    "given the simplicity of the proposed mechanisms here , we expect similar mechanisms to be at work in other animal systems .",

    "the probability per time unit per naive individual to switch from s~s~ to m is given by @xmath5 .",
    "since n - i individuals can potentially decide to follow the initiator(s ) , the probability per time unit ( _ e.g. _ , seconds ) to observe the first naive to depart is given by :      from this expression we can obtain the probability that no naive will depart during time t and that it happens between t and t + dt .",
