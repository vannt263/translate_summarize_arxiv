    "it is known that an accurate stability analysis using the lyapunov approach requires a complete quadratic lyapunov - krasovskii functional .",
    "such an approach was first implemented in the form of the discretized lyapunov - krasovskii functional method in @xcite , and a refined version was presented in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the kernel of the lyapunov - krasovskii functional is piecewise linear .",
    "an alternative approach is the sum - of - squares ( sos ) method presented in @xcite . in the sos method",
    ", the kernel is polynomial . in both approaches ,",
    "the stability problem is reduced to a semi - definite programming problem , or more specifically , a linear matrix inequality problem .    for many practical systems ,",
    "the number of state variables with delays is very small compared with the total number of state variables . for such systems , a special form of the coupled differential - difference equation formulation , or its generalized counterpart",
    ", the coupled differential - functional equation formulation proves to be much more efficient in numerical computation .",
    "the differential - difference formulations can also model systems of neutral type .",
    "the discretized lyapunov - krasovskii functional approach to stability of differential - difference equations is documented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the sos formulation can be found in @xcite .    control synthesis based on complete quadratic lyapunov - krasovskii functional stability conditions is still rare .",
    "an early example is @xcite , in which a more limited class of lyapunov - krasovskii functional is used , and some parameter constraints are imposed .",
    "recently , a synthesis based on the inverse of kernel operator associated with the lyapunov - krasovskii functional for time - delay systems of retarded type in the sos formulation was developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the method by peet et al . to coupled differential - functional equations .",
    "the inverse operator is derived using direct algebraic approach rather than the series expansion approach .",
    "the basic idea of such synthesis is outlined as follows .",
    "consider the coupled differential functional equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is time delay , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the set of real vectors and matrices with @xmath9 dimensions , respectively .",
    "the initial conditions are defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents a shift and restriction of @xmath12 defined by @xmath13,@xmath14 , @xmath15 represents the set of piecewise continuous functions from @xmath16 $ ] to @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 the solutions to the system described by ( [ fun ] ) and ( [ dif ] ) may be represented by a strongly continuous semigroup(@xmath19-semigroup ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 system ( [ fun])-([dif ] ) may be written as an abstract differential equation on @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the infinitesimal generator of the @xmath19-semigroup @xmath25 .",
    "then the stability of the system can be investigated using a quadratic lyapunov - krasovskii functional @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a self - adjoint operator , and @xmath28 represents inner product .",
    "the system is stable if @xmath29 is positive definite in some sense , and its derivative along the system trajectory @xmath30 is negative definite in some sense , where @xmath31 is the adjoint operator of @xmath24 . thus testing the stability of the system",
    "can be accomplished by searching for a @xmath27 which satisfies the above conditions , and the problem can be reduced to a semi - definite programming problem when the kernel of the integral operator which defines @xmath27 is restricted to be either piecewise linear or polynomial because the operator @xmath27 appears linearly in @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , the situation is quite different for control synthesis .",
    "consider a system with input described by the abstract differential equation @xmath33 if we want to design a linear feedback control in the form of @xmath34 so that the closed - loop system is stable , and use the lyapunov - krasovskii functional given in ( [ v ] ) , then the derivative becomes @xmath35 because we need to determine the feedback gain @xmath36 in addition to the operator @xmath27 , @xmath32 becomes a bilinear function of the parameters .",
    "determining the existence of parameters to make @xmath29 positive definite and @xmath32 negative definite poses a formidable numerical problem , for which there is not yet any established reliable method to implement .",
    "one solution to this difficulty is to make a variable transformation @xmath37 and use new parameters @xmath38 instead of @xmath27 and @xmath36 to express @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it can be easily obtained that @xmath41    which are linear with respect to the new parameters . once @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "have been determined , the original parameters @xmath27 and @xmath36 may be obtained by solving ( [ opq ] ) and ( [ opkhat ] ) , at least symbolically .",
    "critical to implementing the above idea is the inversion of the linear operator @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , such an inversion is not easy in general .",
    "it turns out that a relatively simple expression for @xmath44 is possible when @xmath27 is separable , as is utilized in @xcite to carry out control synthesis for time - delay systems of retarded type . in this paper , we present the inversion of @xmath27 for coupled differential - functional equations . unlike the series expansion method used in @xcite ,",
    "a direct algebraic approach is used here .",
    "control synthesis is also described , and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the method .",
    "consider the coupled differential functional equations given in ( [ fun ] ) and ( [ dif ] ) .",
