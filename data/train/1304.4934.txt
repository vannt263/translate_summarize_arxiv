    "an optical luminosity @xmath53  l@xmath4 , wind speed @xmath45 120 , shock velocity @xmath54 10,000  @xcite , and conversion efficiency @xmath55  correspond to a mass - loss rate @xmath56  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .    while the variables used above are only order - of - magnitude approximations , the derived rate for @xmath57 reveals two things about the circumstellar medium .",
    "( 1 ) the difference between the mass - loss rates ( @xmath58 ) suggests that the dust shells were formed during a period of increased , nonsteady mass loss .",
    "( 2 ) compared to mass - loss rates derived from optical data at earlier epochs , our estimate of @xmath56  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5  is consistent with sn 2002ic on day 250 ( for @xmath59 ; @xcite ) , but at least an order of magnitude larger than that measured for sn 2005gj on day 74 @xcite .",
    "the increased circumstellar density derived for sn 2005gj at this late time suggests the presence of another shell of material .",
    "the decline of sn 2002ic occurs at @xmath60800 days , corresponding to the time at which the forward shock ( @xmath54 10,000 ) would reach the blackbody radius ( @xmath25  cm ) . the declining light curve may be attributed to the forward shock overtaking and destroying the dust and/or a decreasing amount of csm interaction accompanied by a declining radiative heating source .",
    "alternatively , the rebrightening of the pre - existing dust in sn 2005gj is likely due to radiative heating by renewed shock interaction with this dense circumstellar shell . from equation [ eqn : inner ] , an order - of - magnitude increase in mass loss results in an increase in the optical luminosity by a factor of 34 , assuming the shock velocity decreases to 0.8 of its former value .",
    "for a constant blackbody radius of @xmath61 cm , equation [ eqn : lbol ] and figure 10 in @xcite show that an increase in the optical luminosity from @xmath62  to @xmath63  l@xmath4  results in a dust temperature increase from @xmath64 to 750  k. since @xmath65 , this change in temperature results in a luminosity increase of a factor of 2.4 .",
    "while we observe a luminosity increase of this magnitude ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , the inferred dust temperature actually _ decreases _  by @xmath66  k.",
    "the implication is that the blackbody radius must also increase from @xmath67  to @xmath68  cm , which would explain a lower dust temperature along with a higher dust mass and luminosity .",
    "the problem with invoking this scenario is that the only way to increase the blackbody radius ( assuming a spherically symmetric shell of dust ) would be for the increased optical luminosity to vaporize all dust out to the new blackbody radius . for a dust vaporization temperature of @xmath69",
    "k , equation [ eqn : lbol ] and figure 8 of @xcite show that to vaporize dust out to @xmath68  cm requires a luminosity of @xmath70  l@xmath4 , which is not likely .",
    "the more probable explanation is that with only four data points , the slopes of the curves in figure [ f2 ] and , therefore the temperatures , are biased by contamination from the underlying galaxy nucleus ( @xmath9  away and a 0.6  pixel scale ) .",
    "the total dust luminosity , which is less sensitive to the slope , is most consistent with radiative heating by renewed shock interaction .",
    "this _ letter _ presents unpublished archival @xmath7  data on sne ia - csm 2002ic and 2005gj obtained @xmath1 and 500 days post - discovery .",
    "the mid - ir data show evidence of emission from warm dust . while we do not have simultaneous observations at shorter wavelengths , the warm - dust parameters are most constant with a pre - existing dust shell heated by a combination of optical , uv , and x - ray emission continuously generated by ongoing csm interaction .",
    "the degree of csm interaction dictates the dust temperature and , thereby , the luminosity . in the case of",
    "sn 2005gj , the mid - ir luminosity nearly doubles more than 1 year post - discovery , suggesting an increasing amount of csm interaction .",
    "we attribute this renewed shock interaction to a dense circumstellar shell produced during a period of increased mass loss by the progenitor companion .",
    "while progenitor mass loss suggests a single - degenerate channel , such rates have also been derived for both the core - degenerate and double - degenerate models @xcite .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations of sne ia - csm will be necessary to better trace the complete mass - loss history and constrain the nature of the companion star . +    this work is based on archival data obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
