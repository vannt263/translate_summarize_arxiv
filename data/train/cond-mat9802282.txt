    "the combination of an electronic interaction and a strong magnetic field in a two  dimensional electron system yields a rich variety of phases .",
    "these are best classified by the filling factor @xmath2 , which is the electron density divided by the density of a completely filled landau level . in the case of @xmath3 , the behavior of the system",
    "resembles that of a fermi liquid in the absence of a magnetic field , or at small magnetic fields , and over the past years , a intriguing picture has emerged : at @xmath4 , each electron combines with two flux quanta of the magnetic field to form a composite fermion ; these composite fermions then move in an effective magnetic field which is zero on the average .",
    "the interpretation of many experiments supports this picture . here",
    ", we mention transport experiments with quantum ( anti ) dots @xcite , in which features of the resistivity are related to closed loops of the composite fermions around the dots , and also focusing experiments @xcite ; more references to recent work can be found in @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the picture was developed in the pioneering work of halperin , lee , and read @xcite .",
    "they formulated the hamiltonian in terms of chern  simons ( cs ) transformed electrons and studied within the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) many physical quantities .",
    "most prominent among these is the effective mass of the composite fermions which they found to diverge at the fermi surface .",
    "this problem of the effective mass was again taken up by stern and halperin @xcite who calculated the effective mass and also the quasiparticle interaction function of landau s fermi  liquid theory , see also @xcite .",
    "recently , kopietz and castilla @xcite used the method of higher  dimensional bosonization to extend the analysis beyond the rpa . thus treating the infrared singularities",
    ", they found that the vertex corrections render the quasiparticle mass finite .",
    "but the composite fermion spectrum should scale with the strength of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "most recently , shankar and murthy @xcite proposed , within the cs approach , a new parametrization which allows to separate the contributions of the cs particles from those of the magneto ",
    "plasmon oscillators in the hamiltonian .",
    "after they restrict the number of the magneto ",
    "plasmon oscillators to the number of electrons in the original hamiltonian , they get a finite quasiparticle mass which scales with the inverse of the strength of the coulomb repulsion .    the cs formulation of interacting electrons , with a density such that the filling factor of a landau level is @xmath3 , nicely realizes the concept of composite fermions , in accordance with the experimental observations .",
    "the price to be paid for using the cs transformation is that the non  interacting system of electrons in a strong magnetic field , after the transformation , becomes a higly complicated , interacting problem  formulated in terms of the cs field .",
    "the cs interaction diverges for small wave vector @xmath0 as @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the singular diagrams in leading order need to be resummed ; these diagramms are well known as the rpa of the jellium problem in @xmath6 .",
    "but there is no small parameter in the problem of non  interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field and there is no reason to expect that the rpa diagrams already reproduce the correct result .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the rpa is even plagued with a marginal divergence in the energy .",
    "the understanding , and even the evaluation of the rpa , still seem to be incomplete :    is it necessary to introduce an ultraviolet cut off in the momentum integrals , in order to restrict the number of the magneto ",
    "plasmon oscillators , or is that already inherent in the theory ?",
    "after all , the introduction of the cut off seems to be crucial for the conclusions in the work of shankar and murthy . the simplest quantity for a study of this question is the ground  state energy .",
    "its evaluation in rpa should be straight forward . but all approaches , of which we are aware , concentrate on the behavior at small wave vector .",
    "therefore , we reconsider the rpa and calculate the expression for the energy , refraining from any approximations in the bare response functions .",
    "there is a second motivation for studying the energy in rpa . for physical reasons ,",
    "it is clear that the exact energy per particle should be expandable in the strength of the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the lowest  order term is exactly known , of course , it is the energy of the unperturbed lowest landau level ; still , one can not expect to obtain that result ( or the corresponding degeneracy ) correctly within the rpa . given the lowest order , we can proceed calculating  in rpa  the next , the term linear in the strength of the coulomb interaction . within a restriction to wave functions of the lowest landau level",
    ", there are no corrections beyond this first order .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the total energy seems not to be measurable ; still , there are numerical simulations of interacting electrons in the lowest landau level by morf and dambrumenil @xcite and girlich @xcite which are well suited for a comparison with our analytical result .",
    "we want to add that such an expansion with respect to the coulomb interaction should be useful also for the calculation of other quantities , as the self energy of the composite fermions , because there the scale is set by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the main problem of the rpa , which does not exist for interacting electrons at zero magnetic field in @xmath6 , remains the logarithmic infrared divergencies caused by the @xmath5 behavior of the cs interaction at small wave vector .",
    "such a divergence already appears in the lowest order in the rpa . beyond the rpa , there are diagrams showing divergencies with powers of the logarithm .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the model in its cs formulation .",
    "then , we calculate ground  state energy and chemical potential from the grand ",
    "canonical potential in rpa using the exact bare response functions .",
    "further , we calculate the first term of the expansion of the energy in the electron ",
    "electron ( coulomb ) interaction .",
    "finally , we discuss the logarithmically divergent diagrams beyond the rpa .",
    "we consider interacting ( spin aligned ) electrons moving in two dimensions in a strong magnetic field @xmath7 in the negative @xmath8direction transverse to the system .",
    "the electronic density of the system is chosen such that the lowest landau level of a non  interacting system is filled to a fraction of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an even integer .",
    "we are mainly interested in @xmath11 . following the work of halperin , lee , and read @xcite",
    ", we describe the hamiltonian in terms of chern  simons ( cs ) fermions or composite fermions which consist of the original electrons and @xmath10 attached flux quanta : h = & & _ ( _ k - ) a^ _ a^ _ + & & + _ _ 1 , _ 2 w _ ; _ 1 , _ 2 a^__1 a^__2 - a^__2 a^__1 - .",

    "@xcite  : in the term quadratic in the cs vector potential , we have replaced a pair of operators , @xmath32 , by its average and neglected thus the third order fluctuations in the density , which would lead to three particle interactions , i.e. , sixth order in @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "thus we see , that within the rpa , the ground ",
    "state energy is infinite .",
    "we wish to add two remarks . first , this divergence in the energy and the divergence in the self energy discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite can not have the same origin , since , there , the divergence depends on the form of the electron ",

    "second , in other cases of rpa calculations , such a divergence in the energy does not appear ; in the case of the coulomb interaction in three dimensions , for example , one has a convergent integral ( @xmath89 ) and the same is true for the coulomb interaction in two dimensions .",
    "consequently , for the case of the cs interaction , it becomes necessary to study diagrams _ beyond _ the rpa .      the chemical potential , as the ground ",
    "state energy , should be derived from the grand ",
    "canonical potential . calculating the mean particle number @xmath34 from @xmath40 and using its value given by the filling factor ( [ filling ] ) ,",

    "[ muee ] this equation should determine the chemical potential @xmath22 via @xmath90 .",
    "but @xmath75 diverges in the infrared regime as @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the r.h.s .  of ( [ muee ] ) becomes infinitely large and there is no positive solution for the parameter @xmath80 from this equation .",
    "hence , we have to conclude that within the rpa , there is no satisfactory solution for the chemical potential .      here",
    ", we wish to study the expansion of the ground",
    " state energy in the strength of the coulomb interaction , @xmath84 . generally , we have for the energy per particle e / n = _ c + e^(1)/n + o(^2 ) . [ expe ]",
    "the first term is the energy of the lowest landau level ; in the rpa , it diverges as shown above . because the cs transformation gives an exact reformulation of the problem also in the absence of an electron ",
    "electron interaction , this divergence must be compensated by other divergent diagrams ; we expect such a compensation by the diagrams discussed in subsec .",
    "[ jenseitsrpa ] below . in the calculation of the second term , now , we encounter the problem that the unperturbed chemical potential can not be determined from the unperturbed grand ",
    "canonical potential because the divergence is not eliminated . as a way out",
    ", we insert in the second term in ( [ expe ] ) the known exact unperturbed value @xmath92 . because for free composite fermions , @xmath93 , i.e.  @xmath94 ( use eq.([filling ] ) ) that value of @xmath22 coincides for half  filling accidentally with the chemical potential of the free composite fermions .",
    "this substitution fixes the variable @xmath80 , @xmath78 . using this and taking the electron density @xmath95 from the experiments of kang et al .",
    "@xcite in gaas ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , one derives for the value of the relative strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath98 which was used in figs . 1 and 2 together with @xmath78 .",

    "in contrast , in the coulomb problems at zero magnetic field in @xmath6 and @xmath49 , such divergences are absent .",
    "the lowest  order divergence is found in the logarithmically divergent diagram ( [ rpa1 ] ) , the first of the rpa diagrams .",
    "in addition , there are diagrams for @xmath102 beyond the rpa diverging with higher powers of @xmath103 .",
    "these diagrams are characterized by independent @xmath104integrations over @xmath105 ; they are either ladder type diagrams or maximally crossed diagrams or combinations of both .",

    "electron interaction .",
    "also , such a summation should improve the result for the coulomb contribution to the ground  state energy .",
    "on the basis of bare response functions calculated analytically for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath52 , we evaluated the grand ",

    "further , we calculated the first  order term in the expansion of the ground  state energy with respect to the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "there , we used for the chemical potential , which remains undefined in the rpa , the unperturbed value .",
    "the result obtained is @xmath106 25% larger than the result of numerical simulations . in view of the simplicity of the random  phase approximation and the absence of a small parameter in the `` unperturbed problem ''",

    "the `` unperturbed problem '' must be solved in a better approximation , which should be free from a divergence .",
    "the `` unperturbed problem '' is well defined , the cs transformation is a rigorous reformulation ; therefore , one should not encounter divergences .",
    "thus , the divergent diagram in the rpa must be compensated by others .",
    "we finally studied other logarithmically divergent diagrams , beyond the rpa , and calculated their leading singularities .",
    "it is an open question , whether taking these leading singularities into account is already sufficient for a compensation .",
