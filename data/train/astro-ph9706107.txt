    "a magnificent ionization nebula fills the central 20  kpc of abell  2597 , a relatively nearby cluster of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath3+[n  ii ] luminosity of this nebula , uncorrected for reddening , is @xmath4 ( heckman 1989 ) .",
    "this intracluster emission - line display is not unique .",
    "such nebulae are common among clusters whose central cooling times are shorter than a hubble time but are absent in clusters with longer central cooling times ( hu , cowie , & wang 1985 ; heckman et al .",
    "the strong correlation between central cooling time and optical nebulosity suggests that the cooling of the intracluster medium somehow excites the line emission . yet , despite this tantalizing hint , the true source of the ionizing energy in these clusters has remained mysterious .",
    "the puzzle is not new . over",
    "65 years ago hubble & humason ( 1931 ) had already noted the unusual appearance of ngc  1275 , the central galaxy of the perseus cluster .",
    "it is quite blue for an elliptical galaxy , and its spectrum bristles with strong emission lines .",
    "two decades later , baade & minkowski ( 1954 ) identified ngc  1275 with the radio source perseus  a , and minkowski ( 1957 ) discovered that its extended emission - line system separated into two subsystems differing by 3000  km  s@xmath5 in radial velocity .",
    "minkowski suggested that the two velocity subsystems arose from a galaxy - galaxy collision .",
    "soon thereafter , the burbidges speculated that ngc  1275 might be an exploding galaxy ( burbidge , burbidge , & sandage 1963 ; burbidge & burbidge 1965 ) , an interpretation given impetus by the the spectacular h@xmath3 image of lynds ( 1970 ) showing a complex of filaments extending up to 100  kpc from the galaxy s center .",
    "x - ray astronomers came upon the mystery of emission lines in clusters from a different direction .",
    "once x - ray telescopes began to resolve the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) in the nearest clusters , it became apparent that the central cooling times in clusters were frequently shorter than a hubble time .",
    "the brevity of these cooling times meant that , if there were no heat source to replenish the radiative losses , the icm at the cores of such clusters must be cooling and settling towards the center in a `` cooling flow '' ( see fabian 1994 for a review ) .",
    "significantly , many of the earliest known cooling - flow clusters also displayed emission - line systems , and advocates of the cooling - flow hypothesis suggested that condensing intracluster gas somehow emitted the optical lines as it cooled from several times @xmath6  k down through @xmath7  k ( fabian & nulsen 1977 ; mathews & bregman 1978 ) .",
    "quantitative followup of cooling - flow clusters revealed that the connection between icm cooling and line emission was complicated .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosity of a hot homogenous gas cooling through h@xmath3-emitting temperatures is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass cooling rate in units of 100 solar masses per year .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosities of intracluster nebulae , if they arose from simple cooling , would require @xmath10 rates up to @xmath11 , tens to hundreds of times higher than the x - ray derived cooling rates .",
    "even the more modest cooling rates inferred from x - ray observations , typically @xmath12 , face a crisis which continues : we have not yet figured out where the cold gas goes .",
    "normal star formation in cooling - flow clusters progresses at only 1 - 10% of @xmath13 ( e.g. mcnamara & oconnell 1989 , 1992 ; oconnell & mcnamara 1989 ) .",
    "enigmatic soft x - ray absorption in many clusters seems to indicate a large mass of cold intracluster gas ( white 1991 ; allen 1993 ; ferland , fabian , & johnstone 1994 ) , but this presumably molecular gas has not yet been detected in any other waveband ( mcnamara , bregman , & oconnell 1990 ; odea 1994 ; braine 1995 ; voit & donahue 1995 ) .    while these difficulties with the cooling - flow hypothesis leave ample room for skepticism , intracluster nebulosity and a short central cooling time are clearly connected .",
    "all clusters known to have extended h@xmath3 emission at their centers also have central cooling times shorter than a hubble time ( hu , cowie , & wang 1985 ; heckman 1989 ; baum 1992 ; donahue 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , the majority of clusters with short central cooling times contain such nebulae , and their line luminosities correlate with @xmath14 .    in hopes of nailing down this crucial piece of the cooling - flow puzzle",
    ", astronomers have invented a variety of schemes to link line emission to the cooling icm .",
    "the models proposed have included repressurizing shocks ( cowie , fabian , & nulsen 1980 ; david , bregman , & seab 1987 ) , high - velocity shocks ( binette , dopita , & tuohy 1985 ) , self - irradiated cooling condensations ( voit & donahue 1990 ; donahue & voit 1991 ) , and turbulent mixing layers ( begelman & fabian 1990 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ) . none have been entirely successful .",
    "recent searches for [ fe  x ] 6374     emission from cooling - flow clusters now seem to rule out any mechanism that relies on the ionizing photons from cooling of hot gas ( donahue & stocke 1994 ; yan & cohen 1996 ) .",
    "photoionization by a central source also appears unlikely because the ionization level in cooling - flow nebulae remains constant while the pressure drops like @xmath15 ( johnstone & fabian 1988 ; heckman 1989 ) .",
    "johnstone , fabian , & nulsen ( 1987 ) , motivated by the anticorrelation they found between the strength of the 4000     break and the h@xmath16 luminosities of cooling flows , proposed that hot stars forming at the centers of cooling flows might photoionize cooling flow nebulae .",
    "initially , this idea did not look promising because the emission - line spectra of cooling - flow nebulae look very different from h  ii region spectra .",
    "however , some recent work has strengthened the link between emission lines and star formation in cooling - flow clusters .",
    "unpolarized excess blue continuum emission correlates with both the spatial distributions aand luminosities of cooling - flow nebulae ( allen 1995 ; cardiel , gorgas , & aragon - salamanca 1995 , 1997 ; mcnamara 1996a , b ) .    in the meantime , we have obtained deep optical spectra of cooling flow clusters that also implicate hot stars as the main stimuli of intracluster h@xmath3 . here",
    "we present our analysis of the emission lines from abell  2597 .",
    "section  2 describes the observations , and ",
    "3 discusses them . because we can detect a large number of important optical lines",
    ", we can determine the density , temperature , and metallicity at the center of the emission - line nebula without resorting to model - dependent assumptions .",
    "our analysis rules out both shocks and photoionization by a hard continuum , leaving hot stars as the most plausible option . however , hot stars have difficulty accounting for the elevated temperatures we measure .",
    "section  4 discusses why an additional source of heating might be necessary and suggests that some sort of energy transfer from the confining hot gas might well supply it .",
    "section  5 summarizes our results .",
    "we observed abell 2597 on august 12 , 1993 , in nearly photometric conditions with the 5 m hale telescope at the palomar observatory . using the double spectrograph",
    ", we gathered both blue and red spectra simultaneously . in these observations ,",
    "a dichroic split the spectrum at approximately 5500  , directing the blue light ( 3770 - 5500 ) onto a grating with 300 lines / mm , a dispersion of 2.15  / pixel , and an effective resolution of @xmath17 , and the red light ( 5550- 7980 ) onto a grating with 316 lines / mm , a wavelength scale of 3.06  / pixel , and an effective resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "our three 3 exposures of abell  2597 totalled 1.5 hours , and in each exposure a 2  slit was placed on the central galaxy of abell 2597 at a position angle of 30@xmath19 .",
    "the position angle remained within 30@xmath19 of the parallactic angle throughout the observation .",
    "the data were processed in a standard way , using iraf , in december 1993 .",
    "we removed pixel - to - pixel variations with a normalized dome flat .",
    "our calibration of the wavelength scale , using arc lamps of hc ( blue ) and near ( red ) and some sky lines , yielded wavelength solutions with 0.5  rms ( red ) and 1.2  rms ( blue ) .",
    "several exposures of a star at different positions along the slit were used to remove curvature along the dispersion axis .",
    "the iraf task _ fitcoords _ in the _ noao.twodspec.longslit _ package was used to correct the data and the task _ background _ was used to select the source - free regions along the slit and to subtract the sky contribution .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction and were flux corrected with standard star exposures of feige 110 and bd33 + 2642 , taken directly before the observations of abell 2597 .",
    "galactic extinction is predicted to be only 0.08 ( @xmath20 ) magnitudes , so we did not deredden the spectrum . any reddening",
    "we measure thus includes the effects of galactic dust .",
    "we extracted a single spectrum , along 8 arcseconds of the slit centered on the nucleus , from each ccd ( figure  [ all_a2597 ] ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of this spectrum exceeded 100 in the continuum and proved suitable for studying the faint emission lines of interest ( figures  [ b_a2597 ] and [ r_a2597 ] ) .",
    "the emission line fluxes , measured using the _ splot _ task , are listed in table  1 .",
    "errors in the fluxes of the red emission lines were assessed automatically by _ splot _ , which generates monte carlo simulations of the data and computes a 1@xmath21 ( 68.3% ) confidence range .",
    "the quoted errors in the red lines thus include uncertainties in the background subtraction and poissonian noise .    the complexity of the stellar continuum underlying the blue lines in our spectrum necessitated a more detailed line - measuring procedure .",
    "to measure the blue lines , we constructed a template spectrum of nearby dwarf elliptical galaxies without emission lines .",
    "these spectra were acquired during the same night with the same instrumental setup .",
    "the absorption features in the template spectrum match the absorption features in the a2597 spectrum quite well .",
    "we fitted the ratio of the a2597 spectrum to the template spectrum with a low - order polynomial , used this polynomial to scale the template spectrum , and subtracted the scaled template from the a2597 spectrum .",
    "template subtraction proved to be very important .",
    "the a2597 emission line + stellar continuum spectrum showed a possible feature at the expected position of [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 , but this feature vanished upon subtraction of the stellar continuum because it was an artifact of the stellar absorption lines ( figure  [ fig4363 ] ) . measuring the he  ii 4686   recombination line also depends critically on template subtraction ( figure  [ fig4686 ] ) .",
    "in general , most of the error in the blue line measurements stems from uncertainties in the subtraction of the background continuum . to gauge this uncertainty , we measured the lines manually many times , evaluating how different methods of background removal changed the total line fluxes .",
    "line flux estimates generally stayed within 5% from measurement to measurement .",
    "for the weakest lines , this variation sometimes approached 10% .",
    "our line - flux uncertainties reflect this variation .",
    "upper limits for the undetected lines were evaluated by measuring the residual rms variation after subtraction of the stellar continuum template . for a fwhm=10 ,",
    "the @xmath22 upper limit is @xmath23 .",
    "hei 4471 was detected just barely above the 3@xmath21 limit of @xmath24 , and we will treat this flux as an upper limit .    the lines all had a fwhm consistent with a velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) of 270 km / sec ( fwhm@xmath25 ) .",
    "the best - fit redshift is @xmath26 .",
    "no correction for the lsr was required because @xmath27 , smaller than our resolution .",
    "most emission - line studies of cooling - flow nebulae have relied on accurate measurements of the strongest lines .",
    "the relative fluxes of features like h@xmath3 , h@xmath16 , [ n  ii ] @xmath16584 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 are generally handy for broad classification of extragalactic nebulae , but by themselves they are not quite so useful for measuring physical quantities such as electron temperature and metallicity . with information on only a small set of lines ,",
    "we are usually left having to fit underconstrained photoionization models to the data .",
    "this dataset on abell  2597 enables us to do much more .",
    "the extensive set of line fluxes in table  1 can be used to measure the reddening of the emission - line spectrum , the density and temperature of the nebular gas , and the nebula s approximate metallicity , all without recourse to underconstrained photoionization models .",
    "we can also put strong limits on the shock - excited [ o  iii ] line at 4363    and the he  ii recombination line at 4686   , measurements that rule out shocks as a major ionizing mechanism and point towards hot stars as the primary ionizing agent in the intracluster nebula .",
    "one of our primary motivations in obtaining a deep blue spectrum of abell 2597 was to measure the 4363     emission line of [ o  iii ] .",
    "shocks radiate this line much more efficiently than photoionized gas , making it an effective diagnostic for distinguishing between these ionization processes .",
    "most shock models predict @xmath28 for the ratio between the [ o  iii ] 4363    line and the sum of the 4959    and 5007    lines .",
    "photoionization models predict smaller @xmath29 values because the [ o  iii ] emitting gas is cooler . at a temperature of 10,000  k , @xmath30 in low - density gas .",
    "we find that at the center of abell 2597 , @xmath31 , strongly indicating that shocks are not the dominant ionization process there .",
    "figure  [ o3rat ] shows @xmath29 predictions for shocks of various velocities from the models of shull & mckee ( 1979 ; sm79 ) , binette ( 1985 ; bdt85 ) , hartigan , raymond , & hartmann ( 1987 ; hrh87 ) , and dopita & sutherland ( ds95 ) .",
    "figure  [ o3_hb_rat ] gives the corresponding ratios of [ o  iii ] to h@xmath16 .",
    "as the shock velocity @xmath32 rises through @xmath33 , the shock begins moving fast enough to collisionally ionize o@xmath34 to o@xmath35 , so the [ o  iii ] fluxes rise rapidly . in the cooling postshock gas , the mean temperature of the [ o  iii ]",
    "emitting gas does not vary much with shock velocity , and the @xmath29 ratio remains close to 0.05 up to shock velocities of a couple hundred km  s@xmath5 .    at higher shock velocities",
    "most of the [ o  iii ] flux comes from photoionized gas either upstream or downstream from the shock . ultraviolet radiation from the cooling gas behind the shock propagates in both directions , ionizing whatever it encounters .",
    "in the ds95 ( s ) and bdt95 models , which consider photoionization of only the downstream gas , @xmath29 almost drops below the observed limits , but the [ fe  x ] limits rule out shocks this fast ( yan & cohen 1995 ) . the ds95 ( sp ) model also includes the photoionizing effects of postshock radiation on the lower - density upstream gas .",
    "the photoionizing precursor creates a more highly ionized region that can radiate strongly in [ o  iii ] .",
    "such a shock satisfies the observed limits on @xmath29 but produces an [ o  iii]/h@xmath16 ratio far larger than observed .    in a very narrow range of shock velocities near 80 km",
    "s@xmath5 shock models come close to satisfying the observed constraints on @xmath29 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath16 but fail for other reasons .",
    "these shocks require extremely unlikely fine tuning and do not reproduce the other forbidden - line ratios . at 80 km",
    "s@xmath5 , the sm79 models predict [ n  ii ]  6584/h@xmath36 and [ s  ii ]  6717/h@xmath37 , whereas our data show [ n  ii ]  6584/h@xmath38 and [ s  ii ]  6717/h@xmath39 .",
    "the disagreement of shock models with the observed [ o  iii ] lines leaves photoionization as the most likely mechanism for generating the emission lines in abell 2597 .",
    "our spectrum of abell 2597 contains hydrogen balmer recombination lines ranging from h@xmath3 to h@xmath40 . assuming case b recombination applies",
    ", we can use the balmer series to measure the reddening of the visible spectrum .",
    "the balmer - line ratios decline systematically from red to blue , relative to case b expectations at a density of @xmath41 and a temperature of 10,000  k , indicating that significant amounts of dust obscure our view of the nebula .",
    "the galactic h  i column towards abell  2597 is a modest @xmath42 , so the large majority of the obscuring dust must reside in the cluster .",
    "figure  [ redden_errs ] illustrates how the inferred amount of dust depends on the geometry of the dusty gas . to convert reddening to extinction , we assume a galactic reddening law ( fitzpatrick 1986 ) .",
    "if the dust forms a screen interposed between us and the nebula , the optical depth of the screen is @xmath43 at the wavelength of h@xmath16 ( @xmath44 ) , corresponding to @xmath45 for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the observed reddening of the balmer lines turns out to be quite consistent with the properties of galactic dust .",
    "alternatively , the grains could be intermixed with the line - emitting gas .",
    "this scenario requires a significantly larger dust column , one we can not limit from above . the expected reddening in the large @xmath46 limit is essentially indistinguishable from that in the screen model .",
    "the [ s ii ] line ratio straightforwardly gives the electron density , @xmath47 , at the center of the nebula .",
    "figure  [ dens_new ] shows that @xmath48 , with a best value of @xmath49 . such a density is typical of the inner regions of cooling - flow nebulae ( e.g. heckman 1989 ) .",
    "we can combine this density measurement with the h@xmath3 surface brightness to estimate the ionization level and column density of the nebula .",
    "the h@xmath3 brightness at the center of the nebula is @xmath50 , implying an emission measure of @xmath51 . at an electron density of @xmath52 ,",
    "the inferred column density of ionized gas is then @xmath53 . because the 21  cm absorption line in abell  2597 indicates a much higher column density of h  i",
    ", the ionized layers are likely to be thin skins on the surfaces of thick neutral clouds ( odea , gallimore , & baum 1994 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath54 of a photoionized nebula is defined to be the ionizing photon density divided by the number density of hydrogen nuclei . a thick photoionized slab of hydrogen gas illuminated from one side has an ionized column @xmath55 , so the observed h  ii column implies @xmath56",
    ", if the nebulae are ionization - bounded and only a few distinct photoionized surfaces lie along a given line of sight through the nebula .",
    "this value of @xmath54 is similar to that indicated by the [ o  iii]/ratio ( voit , donahue , & slavin 1994 ) .",
    "our spectra contain temperature sensitive line sets from both [ o  ii ] ( 3726   , 3729   , 7320   , 7330   ) and [ s  ii ] ( 4068   , 4076   , 6717   , 6731   ) . the two ratios of interest are @xmath57 and @xmath58 to determine @xmath59 , we need to remove the contribution of [ ca  ii ]  7324 to the red [ o  ii ] line blend by subtracting 0.68 times the [ ca  ii ]  7291 flux .",
    "thus , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    to measure accurate temperatures ,",
    "we need to correct these line ratios for reddening . luckily",
    ", reddening affects the temperatures derived from these line ratios in opposite ways . in the temperature - reddening plane ,",
    "the true temperature should lie at the intersection of the loci defined by @xmath59 and @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ temps_shade ] illustrates how the temperatures inferred from these ratios in abell 2597 change as the dust optical depth at h@xmath16 ( @xmath63 ) increases , given an electron density of 200  @xmath64 and a screen model for the obscuring dust .",
    "we also include the locus defined in this same plane by the h@xmath65/h@xmath3 ratio . within the observational errors , these three loci all intersect in a region where @xmath66 .",
    "note that these temperature limits do not depend significantly on the reddening model .",
    "the red [ s  ii ] lines are near h@xmath3 and the blue [ s  ii ] lines are near h@xmath65 , so the necessary balmer - line correction gives the [ s  ii ] reddening correction directly .",
    "the exact correction for the [ o  ii ] lines should differ only slightly from the [ s  ii ] correction .",
    "note also that the 9,500  k lower limit on the electron temperature does not depend on @xmath59 .      because we know both the temperature and density of the ionized gas , the ratio of each forbidden - line flux to the hydrogen balmer lines tells us the abundance of each line - emitting species . to derive elemental abundances from these lines",
    ", we would also need to know the ionization level in the plasma .",
    "given the small ionization parameter (   3.2 ) , the ionization levels are likely to be low , with most species predominantly singly ionized .    figure  [ nii_rat ] shows how the derived abundance of n@xmath34 varies with electron temperature for the [ n  ii ]  6584/h@xmath3 line ratio of 0.83 observed in abell 2597 .",
    "if the electron temperature is @xmath67  k , the n@xmath34/h@xmath34 ratio is about half of the solar n / h ratio . at the upper end of the allowed temperature range , near 12,000  k , the derived n@xmath34/h@xmath34 ratio drops to about 1/4 of the solar n / h .    the story for s@xmath34 is similar to that for n@xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ sii_rat ] shows the derived range of s@xmath34/h@xmath34 , which runs from half - solar at 9,500  k to 1/4 solar at 12,000  k. sulphur is somewhat more likely to be doubly ionized than nitrogen , as the ionization potential for s@xmath34 is 23.3  ev , compared to 29.6  ev for n@xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , the close correspondence between the relative abundances of n@xmath34 and s@xmath34 suggests that sulphur is mostly singly - ionized .    our determination of the oxygen abundance benefits from lines radiated by three different ionization states .",
    "figure  [ o_rat ] shows the relative abundances of o@xmath34 and o@xmath19 , with respect to h@xmath34 . as with n and s",
    ", their sum corresponds to half of the solar o / h ratio at 9,500  k and to 1/4 the solar value at 12,000  k. the relatively modest [ o  iii ] lines indicate that o@xmath35 is a minority species ; both o@xmath34 and o@xmath19 are more common .",
    "the consistency of these abundances with those for nitrogen and sulphur is comforting ; however , some of the [ o  i ] flux could be coming from x - ray heated neutral gas behind the ionized region , so the derived o@xmath19/h@xmath34 is really an upper limit for the ionized gas .      the forbidden lines in cooling - flow nebulae are generally quite strong , relative to the balmer recombination lines , indicating a large amount of heat input per photoionization .",
    "one possible way to supply the requisite heating is with a hard photoionizing continuum that remains strong into the soft x - ray band .",
    "models that have used such an ionizing spectrum to reproduce some of the major line ratios include fast - shock models ( binette et al .",
    "1985 ) , self - irradiation models ( voit & donahue 1990 , donahue & voit 1991 ) , and mixing - layer models ( crawford & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "the helium recombination lines provide a model - independent way to check the hardness of the incident continuum .",
    "our spectrum of abell  2597 includes the he  ii recombination line at 4686    and the he",
    "i recombination lines at 6678   , 5876   , and 4471   .",
    "broad na  i absorption , possibly associated with the dusty h  i gas , contaminates the 5876    line , reducing its usefulness .",
    "the story told by the 4471     line is also unclear because the underlying continuum is so noisy .",
    "we barely detect this line at a level of @xmath68 , whereas we would expect @xmath69 if all the helium were singly ionized .",
    "the 6678     line , located in a cleaner part of the spectrum , is probably the most reliable . at the center of the cluster , @xmath70 , as expected in a nebula where singly - ionized helium predominates .",
    "in contrast , @xmath71 , implying very little he@xmath35 .",
    "the lack of he  ii recombination - line flux from abell  2597 indicates that the photoionizing continuum can not be especially hard . if the incident spectrum follows a @xmath72 power law from 13.6  ev into the soft x - ray band , then @xmath73 for @xmath56 .",
    "this kind of spectrum is too soft to supply the necessary heating per ionization .",
    "the he  ii / h  i line ratio argues against agn irradiation , fast shocks , and cooling gas as sources of the photoionizing continuum , leaving hot stars as the only plausible possibility .",
    "the line - ratio analysis of the previous section eliminated many of the most frequently mentioned energy sources for cooling - flow nebulae .",
    "hot stars were not ruled out by these model - independent diagnostics , but can we construct a hot - star photoionization model that actually works ? in this section , we attempt to do so , but we find that standard hot - star photoionization fails to provide the requisite heating by a factor of about two .",
    "we speculate that some kind of energy transfer from the hot surrounding medium might supply the other half of the heating .      to investigate whether hot stars alone can produce the emission lines observed in abell  2597 , we constructed numerous models with the photoionization code cloudy , version 84 ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "the code includes a grid of kurucz model atmospheres up to effective temperatures of 50,000  k , as well as blackbody spectra at any temperature .",
    "we tested stellar models with @xmath74  k and blackbody models with @xmath75  k incident upon a gas with 0.5 solar metallicity , galactic depletions , and @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ tmodels ] compares the temperatures derived from the [ s  ii ] and [ o  ii ] lines in these models with the temperature ranges derived from the observed lines , assuming @xmath77 . only in the very hottest blackbody models",
    "do the electron temperatures approach the observed values .",
    "thus , the continuua of hot stars are not hard enough to produce temperatures exceeding 9,500  k in gas with half - solar metallicity . if stars are responsible for photoionizing the nebula in abell  2597 , some other energy source must be providing additional heating comparable in magnitude to the photoelectric heating .",
    "figure  [ heat50_50 ] shows a specific example of stellar insufficiency . in these models , a hot stellar continuum with @xmath78  k irradiates a gas with half - solar metallicity .",
    "when the illuminating star is this hot , the o  iii / ratio constrains the ionization parameter to be @xmath79 , in agreement with our estimate from the h@xmath3 surface brightness (   3.3 ) .",
    "refractory elements are depleted into dust grains , as in our own interstellar medium , and photoelectric heating from dust contributes energy to the nebula . both depletion of coolants and dust heating raise the expected equilibrium temperature .",
    "even so , the equilibrium temperatures set by photoelectric heating barely rise above 8000  k.    the extra heating required to boost @xmath80 above 9,500  k is comparable to the photoelectric heating itself . in equilibrium at these higher temperatures",
    "the sum of photoelectric heating and some other supplementary form of heating must balance line cooling . to achieve temperatures in the observed range , the total heating must be roughly twice the photoelectric heating . even when the `` extra heating '' is several times",
    "the photoelectric input , ly@xmath3 cooling keeps the equilibrium temperatures below 12,000  k.    lowering the metallicity does not fix the mismatch between photoelectric heating and line cooling . in ",
    "3.5 we showed that metallicities around 1/4 solar are possible if @xmath81  k. figure  [ heat50_25 ] illustrates that stellar photoionization indeed generates higher equilibrium temperatures in lower metallicity gas , but the extra heating needed to boost @xmath80 all the way up to 12,000  k is still @xmath82 times the photoelectric heating .",
    "models with half - solar metallicities actually require smaller proportions of additional heating .",
    "the failure of stellar photoionization to account fully for the heating of the nebula might be surprising , given the convincing evidence in favor of stellar photoionization as the primary ionizing mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , another ample source of heat energy , namely the pervasive hot intracluster gas , lies close at hand and presumably confines the ionized surfaces of the nebula .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the energy fluxes necessary to power the most luminous cooling - flow nebulae are similar to the product of the pressure @xmath83 and the sound speed @xmath84 in the surrounding medium ( heckman 1989 ; donahue & voit 1991 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "here we argue that this property of cooling - flow nebulae may not be entirely coincidental .",
    "energy can conceivably flow from the hot icm into the cooler nebula in numerous ways .",
    "a few specific examples are electron thermal conduction ( e.g. sparks 1992 ) , acoustic wave heating ( e.g. pringle 1989 ) , and mhd wave heating ( e.g. friaca 1997 ) . all of these heat fluxes saturate at a rate @xmath85 .",
    "assume for the moment that thermal energy passes from the hot medium into the photoionized surfaces of the nebula at the saturated flux @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a parameter of order unity .",
    "meanwhile , the flux of photoelectric heat energy into the nebula is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mean energy per ionizing photon .",
    "the ratio of these energy fluxes is @xmath90 note that in normal h  ii regions , with @xmath91 , the photoelectric heat flux overwhelms any mechanism operating at the rate @xmath92 .",
    "such processes become energetically significant only where @xmath54 is low , in nebulae with dilute radiation fields or high pressures . at the low ionization parameters observed in abell  2597 and other cooling - flow nebulae",
    ", a saturated mechanical energy flux could easily be comparable to the photon energy flux .    while these alternative mechanisms for supplying `` extra heating '' appear promising , and maybe even inevitable , on the broad level of the energy budget , further work is required to see if they will dissipate and distribute their energy throughout the nebula .",
    "for instance , saturated electron thermal conduction can transfer energy at a maximum flux of @xmath93 ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) , but the penetration depths of hot electrons into the nebula depend strongly on their velocities .",
    "an electron of energy @xmath94 passing into a fully ionized @xmath7  k plasma of density @xmath76 will stop after traversing a column density @xmath95 ( voit 1991 ) . comparing @xmath96 to the typical thickness of a low - ionization h  ii layer , @xmath97 ,",
    "shows that the distribution of conductive heating in the nebula will depend sensitively on the exterior temperature .",
    "however , electrons at the expected energies of several kev are clearly energetic enough to penetrate most of the ionized layer , as long as the magnetic field geometry is favorable . a coupled photoionization / conduction code will be needed to solve for the actual temperature structure and line emission from such a cloud .",
    "classifiers of extragalactic nebulae place cooling - flow nebulae among the liners , a heterogeneous class of objects whose [ o  ii ] @xmath13727 lines are stronger than their [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 lines and whose [ o  i ] @xmath16300 lines are greater than 1/3 of [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 ( see filippenko 1996 for a recent review ) .",
    "generally , liners also have [ n  ii ] @xmath16584 / @xmath98 0.6 , unusually high for extragalactic h  ii regions ( e.g. ho 1996 ) .",
    "these large forbidden - line fluxes , relative to and , imply high electron temperatures difficult to attain with normal o - star photoionization .",
    "while photoionization by an agn - like nuclear x - ray source might explain the line ratios in compact liners , the line emission in a significant fraction of liners extends over a few kiloparsecs and appears to be powered by local processes ( filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the he  ii @xmath14686/ratios in liners are frequently lower than agn - like models would predict ( netzer 1990 ) .",
    "quite possibly , supplementary heating of the kind proposed here for cooling - flow nebulae could account for the strong forbidden lines of liners in general , regardless of the ionizing source .",
    "mechanical and conductive forms of heating probably operate constantly at some level in all kinds of photoionized nebulae .",
    "usually , the photon fluxes incident on these nebulae overwhelm any other energy source .",
    "however , when the ambient pressure rises or the photon flux decreases , the ionization parameter drops , reducing the dominance of photoelectric heating . if mechanical or conductive processes transfer heat from a hot confining medium to photoionized clouds at the saturation rate ( @xmath99 ) , then we would expect their contributions to become significant when @xmath100 , the ionization range characteristic of liners .",
    "a variety of physical processes , differing from one astrophysical environment to another , could conspire to produce this characteristic combination of low ionization and supplementary heating in many different situations .",
    "the spectral signatures of these objects would all look liner - like , even though the underlying phenomena differ .",
    "their only shared property would be a value of @xmath54 low enough for other forms of heating to augment photoelectric heating .",
    "our deep spectra of the cooling - flow nebula in abell  2597 strongly constrain the possible ionizing mechanisms .",
    "the lack of [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 emission and the modest [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 ratio rule out shocks .",
    "the balmer sequence indicates substantial reddening . after we correct for reddening , we find that the [ o  ii ] and",
    "[ s  ii ] temperatures agree , placing the nebula between 9,500  k and 12,000  k. temperatures like this in low - ionization nebulae usually signify a hard photoionizing source that extends into the x - ray band , but the small he  ii @xmath14686 / ratio we observe shows that the role of photons @xmath101  ev must be very minor .",
    "hot stars are the only plausible ionizing sources that remain .",
    "our finding that hot stars are the most likely ionizing source agrees with observations of excess blue light and dilution of stellar absorption features in cooling - flow nebulae .",
    "however , the hottest o  stars are still too cool to generate the high temperatures and strong forbidden lines we observe . in a pure photoionization model ,",
    "the observed line ratios require a blackbody - like spectrum exceeding 100,000  k with a luminosity of a few times @xmath102 . the photoelectric heating provided by o  stars with effective temperatures of 50,000  k supplies only about half the necessary heating .",
    "conduction or some other mechanical form of heating might supplement photoelectric heating in cooling - flow nebulae and other liners . at the characteristic ionization parameter @xmath56 , the maximum heat flux from the confining medium",
    "@xmath103 is similar to the photoionizing energy flux .",
    "heat sources like this might always be present in photoionized nebulae , at levels too low to make a difference .",
    "however , in low - ionization nebulae their contributions can grow significant , boosting the forbidden - line output , especially if the temperature of the surrounding medium exceeds @xmath6",
    "k , as in cooling flows or the hot galactic winds expected from starbursts and agns .",
