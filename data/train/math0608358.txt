    "the study of geometric or analytic problems on two dimensional tori is the same as the study of problems on @xmath0 with doubly periodic data .",
    "such situations occur naturally in sciences and mathematics since early days .",
    "the mathematical foundation of elliptic functions was subsequently developed in the 19th century .",
    "it turns out that these special functions are rather deep objects by themselves .",
    "tori of different shape may result in very different behavior of the elliptic functions and their associated objects .",
    "arithmetic on elliptic curves is perhaps the eldest and the most vivid example .    in this paper , we show that this is also the case for certain non - linear partial differential equations . indeed , researches on doubly periodic problems in mathematical physics or differential",
    "equations often restrict the study to rectangular tori for simplicity .",
    "this leaves the impression that the theory for general tori may resemble much the same way as for the rectangular case .",
    "however this turns out to be false .",
    "we will show that the solvability of the _ mean field equation _ depends on the shape of the green function , which in turn depends on the geometry of the tori in an essential way .",
    "recall that the green function @xmath1 on a flat torus @xmath2 is the unique function on @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dirac measure with singularity at @xmath7 . because of the translation invariance of @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 and it is enough to consider _ the green function _",
    "@xmath10 .    not surprisingly , @xmath11 can be explicitly solved in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "for example , using theta functions we have ( cf .",
    "lemma [ green - w ] , lemma [ green - theta ] ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the structure of @xmath11 , especially its critical points and critical values , will be the fundamental objects that interest us .",
    "the critical point equation @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and using the relation @xmath19 with @xmath20 the quasi - periods , the equation takes the simpler form : @xmath21 is a critical point of @xmath11 if and only if the following linear relation ( lemma [ critical ] ) holds : @xmath22    since @xmath11 is even , it is elementary to see that half periods @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the three obvious critical points and other critical points must appear in pair .",
    "the question is : _ are there other critical points ? _ or _ how many critical points might @xmath11 have?_. it turns out that this is a delicate question and can not be attacked easily from the simple looking equation ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "one of our chief purposes in this paper is to understand the geometry of the critical point set over the moduli space of flat tori @xmath26 and to study its interaction with the non - linear mean field equation .",
    "the mean field equation on a flat torus @xmath27 takes the form ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 this equation has its origin in the prescribed curvature problem in geometry like the nirenberg problem , cone metrics etc .. it also comes from statistical physics as the mean field limits of the euler flow , hence the name .",
    "recently it was shown to be related to the self dual condensation of chern - simons - higgs model .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the recent development of this subject .    when @xmath30 for any @xmath31 , it has been recently proved in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the leray - schauder degree is non - zero , so the equation always has solutions , regardless on the actual shape of @xmath27 .",
    "the first interesting case remained is when @xmath32 where the degree theory fails completely . instead of the topological degree ,",
    "the precise knowledge on the green function plays a fundamental role in the investigation of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the first main result of this paper is the following existence criterion whose proof is given in  3 by a detailed manipulation on elliptic functions :    [ main ] for @xmath32 , the mean field equation on a flat torus has solutions if and only if the green function has critical points other than the three half period points .",
    "moreover , each extra pair of critical points corresponds to an one parameter scaling family of solutions .",
    "it is known that for rectangular tori @xmath33 has precisely the three obvious critical points , hence for @xmath32 equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) has no solutions .",
    "however we will show in  2 that for the case @xmath34 and @xmath35 there are at least five critical points and the solutions of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) exist .",
    "our second main result is the uniqueness theorem .",
    "[ uniq ] for @xmath32 , the mean field equation on a flat torus has at most one solution up to scaling .    in view of the correspondence in theorem",
    "[ main ] , an equivalent statement of theorem [ uniq ] is the following result :    [ green ] the green function has at most five critical points .",
    "unfortunately we were unable to find a direct proof of theorem [ green ] from the critical point equation ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "instead , we will prove the uniqueness theorem first , and then theorem [ green ] is an immediate corollary .",
    "our proof of theorem [ uniq ] is based on the method of symmetrization applied to the linearized equation at a particularly chosen even solution in the scaling family .",
    "in fact we study in  4 the one parameter family @xmath36\\ ] ] on @xmath27 within _ even solutions_. this extra assumption allows us to construct a double cover @xmath37 via the weierstrass @xmath38 function and to transform equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) into a similar one on @xmath39 but with three more delta singularities with negative coefficients .",
    "the condition @xmath40 is to guarantee that the original singularity at @xmath41 still has non - negative coefficient of delta singularity .",
    "the uniqueness is proved for this family via the method of continuity . for the starting point @xmath42 , by a construction similar to the proof of theorem [ main ]",
    "we sharpen the result on nontrivial degree to the existence and uniqueness of solution ( theorem [ 4pi ] ) . for @xmath43 $ ]",
    ", the symmetrization reduces the problem on the non - degeneracy of the linearized equation to the isoperimetric inequality on domains in @xmath0 with respect to certain singular measure :    [ sym ] let @xmath44 be a simply connected domain and let @xmath45 be a solution of @xmath46 in @xmath47 .",
    "suppose that the first eigenvalue of @xmath48 is zero on @xmath47 with @xmath49 the first eigenfunction .",
    "if the isoperimetric inequality with respect to @xmath50 : @xmath51 holds for all level domains @xmath52 with @xmath53 , then @xmath54 moreover , ( [ iso ] ) holds if there is only one negative @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    the proof on the number of critical points appears to be one of the very few instances that one needs to study a simple analytic equation , here the critical point equation ( [ linear ] ) , by way of sophisticated non - linear analysis .",
    "to get a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of solutions , we first notice that for @xmath32 , ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) is the euler - lagrange equation of the non - linear functional @xmath57 on @xmath58 , the sobolev space of functions with @xmath59-integrable first derivative . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the non - existence of minimizers for rectangular tori was known in @xcite . here",
    "we sharpen the result to the non - existence of solutions .",
    "also for @xmath60 we sharpen the result on non - trivial degree of equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) in @xcite to the uniqueness of solutions within even functions .",
    "we expect the uniqueness holds true without the even assumption , but our method only achieves this at @xmath42 .",
    "obviously , uniqueness without even assumption fails at @xmath61 due to the existence of scaling .",
    "naturally , the next question after theorem [ uniq ] is to determine those tori whose green functions have five critical points .",
    "it is the case if the three half - periods are all saddle points .",
    "a strong converse is proved in @xcite :    * theorem a. * _ if the green function has five critical points then the extra pair of critical points are minimum points and the three half - periods are all saddle points .",
    "_    together with theorem [ main ] , this implies that _ a minimizer of @xmath62 exists if and only if the green function has more than three critical points_. in fact we show in @xcite that any solution of equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) must be a minimizer of the nonlinear functional @xmath62 .",
    "thus we completely solve the existence problem on minimizers , a question raised by nolasco and tarantello in @xcite .    by theorem",
    "a , we have reduced the question on detecting a given torus to have five critical points to the technically much simpler criterion on ( non)-local minimality of the three half period points . in this paper",
    ", however , no reference to theorem a is needed .",
    "instead , it motivates the following comparison result , which also simplifies the criterion further :    [ comparison - intro ] let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be two half period points .",
