    "a central concept in welfare economics are social welfare functions ( swfs ) in the tradition of arrow , i.e. , functions that map a collection of individual preference relations over some set of alternatives to a social preference relation over the alternatives .",
    "arrow s seminal theorem states that every swf that satisfies pareto optimality and independence of irrelevant alternatives is dictatorial @xcite .",
    "this sweeping impossibility significantly strengthened an observation by @xcite and sent shockwaves throughout economics as well as political philosophy and political theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a large body of subsequent work has studied whether more positive results can be obtained by modifying implicit assumptions on the domain of admissible preferences , both individually and collectively .",
    "these approaches can be roughly divided into two categories .",
    "for one , as pioneered by @xcite , the assumption of _ collective _ transitivity has been weakened to quasi - transitivity , acyclicity , path independence or similar conditions .",
    "although this does allow for non - dictatorial aggregation functions that meet arrow s criteria , these functions turned out to be highly objectionable , usually on grounds of involving a weak kind of dictatorship or violating other conditions deemed to be indispensable for reasonable preference aggregation ( for an overview of the extensive literature , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) because acyclicity is necessary and sufficient for the existence of maximal elements when there is a finite number of alternatives .",
    "@xcite concludes that `` the arbitrariness of power of which arrow s case of dictatorship is an extreme example , lingers in one form or another even when transitivity is dropped , so long as _",
    "some _ regularity is demanded ( such as the absence of cycles ) . ''",
    "another stream of research has analyzed the implications of imposing structure on the _ individual _ preferences .",
    "this has resulted in a number of positive results for restricted domains , such as dichotomous or single - peaked preferences , which allow for attractive swfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many economic domains are concerned with an infinite set of outcomes , which satisfies structural restrictions such as compactness and convexity .",
    "preferences over these outcomes are typically assumed to satisfy some form of continuity and convexity , which roughly imply that preferences are robust with respect to minimal changes in outcomes and with respect to convex combinations of outcomes .",
    "various results have shown that arrow s impossibility remains intact under these assumptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite provide an overview and conclude that `` economic domain restrictions do not provide a satisfactory way of avoiding arrovian social choice impossibilities , except when the set of alternatives is one - dimensional and preferences are single - peaked . ''",
    "the point of departure for the present approach is the observation that , to the best of our knowledge , all impossibilities require some form of transitivity ( e.g. , acyclicity ) , even though no such assumption is necessary to guarantee the existence of maximal elements in continuous and convex domains .",
    "@xcite has shown that all continuous and convex preference relations admit a maximal element in every non - empty , compact , and convex set of outcomes . moreover",
    ", returning maximal elements under the given conditions satisfies standard properties of choice consistency introduced by @xcite .",

    "is preferred to lottery @xmath0 but the certainty equivalent of @xmath1 is less preferred than the certainty equivalent of @xmath0 , shows experimental failures of transitivity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] as @xcite writes , `` once considered a cornerstone of rational choice theory , the status of transitivity has been dramatically reevaluated by economists and philosophers in recent years . ''",
    "we show that , not only does arrow s theorem cease to hold on convex domains when dispensing with transitivity , but , moreover , arrow s axioms and some weak technical assumptions narrow down the choice of a suitable swf to an intriguing combination of pairwiseness and utilitarianism .",
    "more precisely , we consider a convex set of outcomes consisting of all probability measures with finite support on some abstract set of alternatives .",
    "examples of outcome sets are shares of divisible public goods , lotteries , time shares , monetary shares , etc .",
    "individual and collective preference relations over these outcomes are assumed to satisfy continuity , convexity , and symmetry .",
    "we then show that there is a unique inclusion - maximal cartesian domain of preference profiles that allows for arrovian aggregation while satisfying minimal richness conditions .",
    "this domain allows for arbitrary preferences over pure outcomes , which in turn completely determine an agent s preferences over all remaining outcomes . when interpreting outcomes as lotteries , this preference extension has a particularly simple and intuitive explanation : an agent prefers one lottery to another if and only if the former is more likely to return a more preferred pure outcome .",
    "incidentally , this preference extension , which constitutes a central special case of skew - symmetric bilinear ( ssb ) utility functions as introduced by @xcite , has been backed by recent experimental evidence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we then prove that the only arrovian swfs on this domain are affine welfare maximizers for the underlying ssb utility functions . as a consequence",
    ", there is a unique anonymous arrovian swf , which compares outcomes by the sign of the bilinear form given by the pairwise majority margins .",
    "the resulting collective preference relation over _ pure _ outcomes coincides with majority rule and the corresponding choice function is therefore consistent with condorcet s principle of always returning a pure outcome that is majority - preferred to every other pure outcome .",
    "this relation is naturally extended to mixed outcomes such that , by the minimax theorem , every compact and convex set of outcomes admits a collectively most preferred outcome .",
    "our results challenge the traditional  transitive  way of thinking about preferences , which has been largely influenced by the pervasiveness of scores and grades .",
    "a compelling opinion on transitivity is expressed in the following apt quote by decision theorist peter c. fishburn : `` transitivity is obviously a great practical convenience and a nice thing to have for mathematical purposes , but long ago this author ceased to understand why it should be a cornerstone of normative decision theory .",
    "[  ] the presence of intransitive preferences complicates matters [  ] however , it is not cause enough to reject intransitivity .",
    "an analogous rejection of non - euclidean geometry in physics would have kept the familiar and simpler newtonian mechanics in place , but that was not to be .",
    "indeed , intransitivity challenges us to consider more flexible models that retain as much simplicity and elegance as circumstances allow .",
    "it challenges old ways of analyzing decisions and suggests new possibilities '' @xcite .",
    "a special case of our setting , which has been particularly well studied , concerns sets of outcomes that consist of all lotteries over some finite set of alternatives and individual preferences over lotteries that satisfy the _",
    "von neumann - morgenstern axioms _ , i.e. , preferences over lotteries that can be represented by assigning cardinal utilities to alternatives such that lotteries are compared based on expected utility .",
    "@xcite conjectured that arrow s impossibility still holds under these assumptions and @xcite showed that this is indeed the case when there are at least four alternatives .",
    "there are various versions of this statement which differ in modeling assumptions and whether swfs aggregate cardinal utilities or the preference relations represented by these utilities @xcite .",
    "the one closest to the framework of this paper is theorem  4.3 by @xcite .",
    "our results apply to arrovian aggregation of preferences over lotteries under much loosened assumptions about preferences over lotteries . in particular",
    ", the axioms we presume entail that preferences over lotteries can be represented by _ skew - symmetric bilinear ( ssb ) utility functions _ , which assign a utility value to each pair of lotteries .",
    "one lottery is preferred to another lottery if the ssb utility for this pair is positive .",
    "ssb utility theory is a generalization of linear expected utility theory due to @xcite , which does not require the controversial independence axiom and transitivity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "independence requires that if lottery @xmath1 is preferred to lottery @xmath0 , then a coin toss between @xmath1 and a third lottery @xmath2 is preferred to a coin toss between @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( with the same coin used in both cases ) .",
    "there is experimental evidence that independence is systematically violated by human decision makers .",
    "the allais paradox @xcite is perhaps the most famous example .",
    "detailed reviews of such violations , including those reported by @xcite , have been provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our characterization of arrovian swfs is related to harsanyi s _ social aggregation theorem _",
    "@xcite , which shows that , for von neumann - morgenstern preferences over lotteries , weighted welfare maximization already follows from pareto indifference . however , harsanyi s theorem is a statement about a single preference profile considered in isolation .",
    "the weights given to the agents may depend on their preferences .",
    "this can be prevented by adding axioms that connect the collective preferences across different profiles .",
    "the swf that derives the collective preferences by adding up the normalized utility representations is known as _ relative utilitarianism _",
    "it was characterized by @xcite using essentially independence of redundant alternatives ( a weakening of independence of irrelevant alternatives ) and monotonicity ( a weakening of a pareto - type axiom ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite and further explored by @xcite , aggregating ssb utility functions is fundamentally different from aggregating von neumann - morgenstern utility functions in that harsanyi s pareto axiom does not imply weighted welfare maximization . as we show in this paper ,",
    "this can be rectified by considering a multi - profile framework and independence of irrelevant alternatives .",
    "the probabilistic voting rule that returns the maximal elements of the unique anonymous arrovian swf is known as _",
    "maximal lotteries _ @xcite and was recently axiomatized using two consistency conditions @xcite .",
