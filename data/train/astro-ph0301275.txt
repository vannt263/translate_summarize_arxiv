    "@xmath1 observations of wd2226@xmath0210 have detected not only a soft spectral component as expected from the white dwarf s photosphere , but also a hard spectral component peaking at 0.8 kev @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath7 observations have confirmed that the hard x - ray emission is unresolved and coincident with the white dwarf ; however , the luminosity and variability of the hard x - ray emission is similar to that of a dme star @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations by @xcite detected variability in the h@xmath8 line profile of wd2226@xmath0210 , suggesting the presence of a companion .",
    "it is thus possible that wd2226@xmath0210 has an x - ray - emitting dme companion which is too faint and close to the white dwarf to be detected at visible wavelengths .",
    "based on the @xmath9 magnitude of wd2226@xmath0210 reported by @xcite and the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 magnitudes from the 2mass survey ( see table 3 below ) , we estimate that the hypothetical companion must have a spectral type later than m5 - 6v .",
    "hard x - ray emission from white dwarfs may be used to infer the presence of a binary companion .",
    "indeed , @xcite found 9 da white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission using the @xmath1 all - sky survey , and all of these 9 white dwarfs have late - type ( f , g , k , and m ) companions .",
    "this has motivated us to search for other white dwarfs which exhibit hard x - ray emission .",
    "we have found that 94 white dwarfs cataloged by @xcite appear coincident with @xmath1 x - ray point sources in the wga catalog ( * ? ? ? * hereafter wgacat ) . to confirm the positional coincidence",
    ", we have downloaded the @xmath1 data , and compared these x - ray images with optical images of the white dwarfs .",

    ", we have used the literature and near - ir photometry to assess the existence of binary companions , and further investigate the origin of hard x - ray emission from the apparently single white dwarfs .",
    "this paper reports the results of our study .",
    "the sample of white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission and our method of analysis are described in section 2 , the binarity status of the white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission is reported in section 3 , and the origin and implications of the hard x - ray emission associated with white dwarfs is discussed in section 4 . a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "to search for x - ray emission from white dwarfs , we have correlated the white dwarfs from the most recent catalog by @xcite with the x - ray sources from the wgacat , a point source catalog generated from all @xmath1 pspc pointed observations made without the boron filter . for an initial identification of positional coincidence , we require better than 1@xmath13 agreement between the cataloged positions of the white dwarf and x - ray point source .",
    "this is a conservative criterion because : ( 1 ) the on - axis point spread function ( psf ) of the @xmath1 position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) is @xmath1440@xmath15 at 1 kev and much worse near 0.1 kev @xcite , ( 2 ) the coordinates of the white dwarf might be uncertain by up to 30@xmath15 , and ( 3 ) the proper motions of the white dwarfs have not been considered and in some cases may be large enough for the star to move more than 1@xmath13 between the epochs when the optical and x - ray observations were made .",
    "we find 94 white dwarfs that appear to be associated with point x - ray sources . to confirm the positional coincidence and to examine further the x - ray spectra of these sources ,",
    "we have retrieved the event files of their @xmath1 pspc observations from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "the pspc event files are used to extract broad - band ( 0.12.4 kev ) x - ray images .",
    "these x - ray images are smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath16 = 15@xmath15 and the resulting x - ray contours at 10 , 20 , 50 , 70 , and 90% of the peak intensity are overplotted on the broad - band optical images retrieved from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) . to identify the white dwarfs ,",

    "eighteen of the 94 coincidences we initially identified could not be confirmed , noted as u14 in column 7 of table 1 , because the x - ray sources are not convincingly centered on the white dwarf ( u1 ) , the positions of the x - ray sources are compromised by the occultation of the pspc window support structure or the superposition of a bright background ( u2 ) , multiple candidates of optical counterparts are present within the pspc psf ( u3 ) , or the x - ray sources are too faint to be credible ( u4 ) .    one notable example of a u4 mis - identification is wd1910 + 047 , which was discovered and suggested by @xcite to be associated with an _ einstein _",
    "x - ray source .",
    "the weak wgacat source j1912.5 + 0452 located within 1@xmath13 from wd1910 + 047 was detected in a 2.8 ks pspc observation ( rp400271n00 ) at a 44@xmath13 off - axis position , but not confirmed in a 20 ks pspc observation ( rp400271a01 ) with identical pointing .",
    "we have examined this shallow pspc observation and concluded that this source is spurious . using a deep pspc observation ( rp500058a02 , 20.6 ks ) centered at 19@xmath13 from wd1910 + 047 , we find an x - ray source near the white dwarf , but it is coincident with a star @xmath1480@xmath15 se of the white dwarf and the x - ray spectrum is typical for coronal emission from a late - type star ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this result explains the conclusion of the model atmosphere analysis by @xcite that the _ einstein _",
    "x - ray source is too luminous for the white dwarf .",
    "there remain 76 coincidences that are confirmed with a high degree of confidence .",
    "we have further extracted x - ray spectra from the pspc event files for these x - ray sources coincident with white dwarfs .",

    "the spectra of the remaining 7 sources have characteristics consistent with coronal emission at temperatures of a few @xmath17 k. these pspc spectra appear ",
    "double - peaked \" because of the carbon k@xmath8 absorption of the pspc entrance window at 0.240.4 kev ; the hard component ( @xmath20.5 kev ) is at least 25% as strong as the soft component ( @xmath30.5 kev ) .    the 17 white dwarfs associated with hard x - ray emission are listed in table 2 , and their images and x - ray spectra are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the left panels display dss images centered on the white dwarfs and overlaid by x - ray contours to illustrate the positional coincidence of the white dwarf and the x - ray source .",
    "the white dwarf position is marked when several stars are projected in its vicinity .",
    "the right panels display the pspc spectra of the x - ray sources . for objects overwhelmed by soft x - ray emission",
    ", we also plot the spectra with an expanded y - scale to show the hard component .",
    "the pspc observations listed in table 1 have been used to extract these x - ray images and spectral information .",
    "note that column 10 of table 1 shows many more white dwarfs with 3@xmath16 detections in the 0.92.4 kev band .",
    "however , all except the above 17 white dwarfs are rejected because their coincidences with x - ray source are not confirmed ( u1 - 4 in column 7 ) or the wgacat source counts are contaminated / confused with background hard x - ray sources .",
    "for example , some white dwarfs are observed at such large off - axis angles ( @xmath18 ) that the psf contains background sources ( e.g. , wd0037 + 312 and wd1040 + 451 ) , and some are blended with adjacent sources ( e.g. , wd1821 + 643 , wd1844@xmath0654 , and wd0904 + 511 ) . under such circumstances ,",
    "the source detection algorithm of wgacat does not effectively exclude contaminating background sources within the psf , resulting in the apparent detection of hard x - ray emission .",
    "white dwarfs by themselves do not emit hard ( @xmath2 0.5 kev ) x - rays .",
    "if a white dwarf accretes material from its surroundings , the gravitational energy released may power hard x - ray emission .",
    "in general , we can rule out the accretion of interstellar material because white dwarfs usually are not in a dense interstellar environment .",
    "we can also rule out the accretion of the planetary nebula produced by a white dwarf s progenitor , as it either has dissipated already or is expanding away at a speed much greater than the escape velocity .",
    "thus , the most likely source to provide material for accretion onto a white dwarf is a binary companion . alternatively ,",
    "if a white dwarf has a binary companion with coronal activity , the hard x - ray emission from the companion would appear to be associated with the white dwarf .",
    "we therefore suspect that white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission are in binary systems .",
    "a literature search of the 17 white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission reveals that 12 of them are known binaries .",

    "x - ray emission from white dwarfs is expected to be soft , but roughly 20% of x - ray sources associated with white dwarfs exhibit a hard x - ray component ( @xmath20.5 kev ) . what is the origin of hard x - ray emission associated with white dwarfs ?",
    "we initially speculated that all white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission possess binary companions , but our literature search reveals that 12 of the 17 white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission are known to be in binary or multiple systems , one is superposed by chance near a background agn , and the remaining four are apparently single white dwarfs .",
    "below we argue that the binary companions are indeed directly or indirectly responsible for the hard x - ray emission associated with white dwarfs in binary systems , use 2mass photometry to assess the existence of late - type companions , and discuss the hard x - ray emission from the hottest apparently single white dwarfs .",
    "two of our 12 white dwarfs in binary systems are known to accrete material from their companions : mira and the cataclysmic variable v3885 sgr .",
    "the accretion of the companion s material onto the surface of the white dwarf produces hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "of the ten non - accreting systems , six have one or two dme companions , two have a k2v companion , one has an f5iv - v companion , and one has a g5iii companion .",
    "these late - type companions either are known for their active coronae or have emission lines indicating coronal activity ; therefore , these companions are most likely responsible for the observed hard x - ray emission . in some cases ,",
    "the origin of the hard x - ray emission has been unambiguously established to be the late - type companions by either positional coincidence ( e.g. , wd1633 + 572 ) or observations of eclipses ( e.g. , wd0347 + 171 ) .    to confirm that these late - type companions are the source of the hard x - ray emission , we compare the hard x - ray luminosities and plasma temperatures of the binary systems with those expected from single late - type stars .",
    "we have fitted thin plasma emission models @xcite to the 0.52.4 kev portion of the spectra for the objects with sufficient counts in this energy band .",
    "the resultant plasma temperature @xmath26 and x - ray luminosity @xmath27 in the 0.52.4 kev band are given in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath27 of white dwarfs with late - type companions are completely consistent with those seen in dm and k stars , 10@xmath2810@xmath29 ergs  s@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit plasma temperatures are also in the range for stellar coronae .",
    "we further assess whether coronal activities of the late - type companions may be induced by binary interaction by correlating the projected binary separation , @xmath22 , with the x - ray luminosity ( see table 2 ) .",
    "no clear correlation is seen .",
    "this lack of correlation may be caused by the small number of binary systems in our sample and the wide range of physical parameters involved .",
    "the cataclysmic variable wd1944@xmath0421 ( v3885 sgr ) has the highest hard x - ray luminosity , which is also in accord with the expectation of accretion from a roche - lobe - filled companion .",
    "thus , the hard x - ray emission from white dwarfs in known binary systems can be explained by the presence of their companions .",
    "the remaining four white dwarfs associated with hard x - ray emission appear to be single .",
    "if these white dwarfs contain previously - unknown , late - type companions , near - ir photometry may reveal these companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have obtained @xmath31 photometric measurements of white dwarfs with hard x - rays available in the second incremental data release of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , and listed them in table 3 , along with optical photometry from @xcite . in the case of",
    "wd1633 + 572 where the white dwarf and the binary dme companions are resolved by 2mass , separate entries are given .",
    "to enlarge the sample for comparison , we have added two additional white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission that are not from our survey : wd0005 + 511 (= kpd  0005 + 5106 ; its hard x - ray emission will be discussed in  4.3 ) and wd2226@xmath0210 (= the central star of the helix nebula ; its hard x - ray emission is described in  1 ) .",
    "clear near - ir excess is observed in the four known binary systems , but not in the apparently single white dwarfs .",
    "the lack of near - ir excess , in conjunction with known distances , places constraints on the possible companions of the white dwarfs .",
    "the constraint is more stringent for white dwarfs at smaller distances because it would be harder to hide a companion .",
    "the nearest apparently single white dwarf with hard x - ray emission is wd1134 + 300 at 15.3 pc .",
    "we estimate that its near - ir magnitudes can hide only a brown dwarf companion more than 3 mag fainter than an m7v star .",
    "therefore , wd1134 + 300 has no stellar - mass companions , and the agn projected within the pspc psf @xcite is solely responsible for the hard x - ray emission observed .",
    "two other white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission have known distances , wd1234 + 481 and wd2226@xmath0210 .",
    "their lack of near - ir excess indicates that wd1234 + 481 can hide a companion of spectral type m7v or later , and wd2226@xmath0210 later than m5 - 6v .",
    "if these two apparently single white dwarfs indeed have faint , late - type companions , then the hard x - ray emission detected by @xmath1 is more effective than the near - ir excess detected by 2mass in diagnosing the existence of a faint late - type companion .",
    "two of the apparently single white dwarfs associated with hard x - rays from our survey are among the hottest known : wd1159@xmath0034 and wd2226@xmath0210 . to compare these two hot white dwarfs to the one that has been suggested to possess a corona , kpd  0005 + 5106 , we have retrieved an archival @xmath1 pspc pointed observation ( rf200428n00 ) that was made with the boron filter for an exposure time of 5 ks .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the pspc spectrum of kpd0005 + 5106 shows not only the soft atmospheric emission below 0.5 kev , but also hard x - ray emission near 1 kev .",
    "this hard x - ray emission was not detected previously by @xcite using the @xmath1 all - sky survey observation of exposure time 504 s. as the 5 ks pointed observation detected only 24@xmath326 counts in the 0.52.4 kev band , if the hard x - ray flux is constant , we expect only 2.4@xmath321.5 hard x - ray counts in a 504 s exposure .",
    "the non - detection of the hard component by @xcite thus does not imply a temporal variation .",
    "the presence of hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 requires a plasma temperature at least 10@xmath33 k , much higher than that suggested by @xcite , and may be responsible for photoionizing and producing the recombination lines observed @xcite .",
    "we have examined the 2mass @xmath31 photometric data for kpd  0005 + 5106 ( see table 3 ) , and find no evidence for a near - ir excess .",
    "thus , kpd  0005 + 5106 is another apparently single hot white dwarf with hard x - ray emission .",
    "while our statistical sample is extremely limited , it is intriguing that @xmath1450% of the apparently single white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission are among the hottest known white dwarfs : 120,000 k for wd0005 + 511 ( = kpd  0005 + 5106 ; * ? ? ?",

    "is it possible that the hard x - ray emission is the high - energy wien tail of the blackbody emission from deep in the stellar atmosphere ?",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to model the atmospheres of these white dwarfs and answer this question theoretically .",
    "instead , we will examine x - ray observations of the hottest white dwarfs to search for trends in their hard x - ray properties in order to gain insight into the origin of their hard x - ray emission .",
    "we first examine x - ray properties of pg  1159 stars .",
    "many pointed @xmath1 pspc observations of pg  1159 stars were made with the boron filter .",

    "these four hot do and dao white dwarfs and the above nine pg  1159 white dwarfs will be discuss below in more detail .",
    "the spectral type , stellar effective temperature , visual magnitude , and @xmath1 observations of these 13 hot white dwarfs are summarized in table 4 . to illustrate the spectral properties of the 11 hot white dwarfs",
    "whose x - ray emission has been detected by @xmath1 pspc observations , in figure 4 we present their soft x - ray images in the 0.10.4 kev band and the hard x - ray images in the 0.62.4 kev band .",
    "it is evident that hard x - ray emission is clearly detected only from wd0005 + 511 , wd1159@xmath0034 , and wd2226@xmath0210 , as we have concluded earlier , and possibly detected at a 2@xmath16 level from wd0122@xmath0753j .",
    "the spectral types of these four white dwarfs are do , dqzo.4 , dao , and do , respectively .    below we divide the 11 hot white dwarfs detected in x - rays according to their spectral types , discuss the implications of their hard x - ray properties , and speculate on the possibility of a photospheric origin of the hard x - ray emission .    * _ dao ( wd1957 + 225 and wd2226@xmath0210 ) : _ + hard x - ray emission is detected from wd2226@xmath0210 in the helix nebula , but not from wd1957 + 225 in the dumbbell nebula .",
    "as these two dao white dwarfs have similar effective temperatures , and as wd1957 + 225 is only 0.8 mag fainter but has a four times longer exposure time , the lack of hard x - ray emission from wd1957 + 225 signifies a real difference from wd2226@xmath0210 .",
    "furthermore , wd2226@xmath0210 shows temporal variations of its hard x - ray emission and h@xmath8 line profile , suggesting the existence of a late dme companion @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence indicating that deep photospheric emission is the origin of hard x - rays associated with dao white dwarfs . *",

    "+ among these four do white dwarfs , wd0005 + 511 has an unambiguous detection of hard x - rays , and wd0122@xmath0753j has a possible detection of hard x - rays . wd1522 + 662 does not show hard x - ray emission , but the @xmath1 observation has only 4.7 ks exposure time and wd1522 + 662 is faint with @xmath34 = 16.4 mag . wd2117",
    "+ 342j is observed at a 40@xmath13 from the center of the pspc field - of - view and the poor psf prohibits a conclusive assessment of the existence of faint hard x - ray emission .",
    "it may be possible that faint hard x - ray emission can emerge from the hot , deep layer of the photospheres of do white dwarfs , but more detections are needed to confirm it . *",

    "wd1144 + 044 has a non - detection , but it is slightly fainter than wd1159@xmath0034 and its exposure time is only half as long .",
    "wd1821 + 643 in the pn k1 - 16 is projected near a bright hard x - ray source , a cluster of galaxies surrounding the qso e1821 + 643 @xcite , so it is difficult to determine its hard x - ray properties accurately from figure 4 .",
    "we have examined an archival @xmath7 hetg observation of qso e1821 + 643 ( pi : c.  r.  canizares ; 101 ks ) ; in this observation wd1821 + 643 is detected and clearly resolved from qso e1821 + 643 , but no hard x - ray emission from wd1821 + 643 is seen . wd1159@xmath0034 and wd1821 + 643 are well - known pulsators @xcite , while wd1144 + 044 is not .",
    "it is thus unlikely that the hard x - ray emission is related to the stellar pulsation .",
    "* _ pg  1159 and dz1 ( wd0044@xmath0121 and wd1501 + 664 ) : _ + wd0044@xmath0121 is a pg  1159 star in the pn ngc246 ; wd1501 + 664 is classified as dz1 and is the hottest white dwarf @xcite .",
    "neither of these two hot white dwarfs show hard x - ray emission ; the high opacity of the h- and he - free atmosphere of wd1501 + 664 may be the culprit of its non - detection @xcite .",
    "the above sample of hot white dwarfs is very limited , but allows us to eliminate improbable origins of hard x - ray emission .",
    "for example , stellar pulsation is not likely to produce hard x - ray emission , as wd1159@xmath0034 is the only pulsator with hard x - ray emission .",
    "stellar winds are not likely to be the origin of hard x - ray emission either , as wd1159@xmath0034 has hard x - rays but no measurable past or ongoing mass loss @xcite , while appreciable mass loss but no hard x - ray emission has been detected from wd0044@xmath0121 and wd1821 + 643 @xcite .",
    "there leaves the tantalizing suggestion that hard x - rays may be emitted by hot do and dqzo white dwarfs .",
    "while it is necessary to model their atmospheres to understand theoretically whether hard x - rays from beneath the atmosphere may leak through , it is also necessary to obtain better high - resolution x - ray images to confirm that the hard x - ray emission is indeed associated with the white dwarfs ( as opposed to background objects projected in their vicinity ) and high - quality x - ray spectra for detailed spectral analysis .",
    "we have correlated the recent white dwarf catalog by @xcite with the @xmath1 pspc point source catalog ( wgacat ) , and found 76 white dwarfs coincident with x - ray sources at a high level of confidence .",
    "we have further found that 17 of these sources show hard x - ray emission ( @xmath2 0.5 kev ) .",
    "two of these white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission accrete material from their companions , while the other ten have late - type companions that are known to have active coronae and emit hard x - rays .",
    "one white dwarf has an agn projected within the pspc psf contributing to the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the remaining four white dwarfs ( wd0339@xmath0451 , wd1159@xmath0034 , wd1234 + 481 , and wd1333 + 510 ) and two additional white dwarfs ( wd0005 + 511 and wd2226@xmath0210 ) with hard x - ray emission appear single .",
    "the lack of near - ir excess for wd1234 + 481 and wd2226@xmath0210 at known distances constrains the possible spectral types of the hidden companions to later than m7v and m5 - 6v , respectively .",
    "we suggest that hard x - ray emission may be more effective than near - ir photometry in diagnosing faint , late - type companions of white dwarfs , if the hard x - ray emission associated with the six apparently single white dwarfs indeed originates from hidden companions .",
    "it is intriguing that three of the six apparently single white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission have high stellar effective temperatures .",
    "we have searched the @xmath1 archive for observations of pg  1159 stars and examined the x - ray properties of a sample of 13 hot white dwarfs with different spectral types .",
    "comparisons among these hot white dwarfs lead to the following conclusions : ( 1 ) dao wd2226@xmath0210 most likely possesses a late dme companion which emits hard x - rays , ( 2 ) stellar pulsation can not be connected to the hard x - ray emission , ( 3 ) fast stellar winds are not likely to be the origin of hard x - ray emission , and ( 4 ) the high - energy wien tail of emission deep in the atmospheres of hot do and dqzo white dwarfs remains a tantalizing explanation for the hard x - ray emission observed .",
    "our statistics are limited by the incompleteness of the wgacat , which has been derived solely from pointed @xmath1 pspc observations made without filters , while many pspc observations of white dwarfs were made with a boron filter . a complete survey for white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission using the entire @xmath1 archive",
    "is needed to enlarge the sample .",
    "follow - up high - resolution deep x - ray observations with @xmath7 or _ xmm - newton _ are needed to confirm the positional coincidence of the white dwarfs and the x - ray sources , and to study the spectral properties in order to investigate the origin and nature of hard x - ray emission associated with white dwarfs .",

    "<S> twelve of these white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission are in known binary systems , in two of which the accretion of the close companion s material onto the white dwarf produces hard x - ray emission , and in the other ten of which the late - type companions coronal activity emits hard x - rays . </S>",

    "<S> the remaining four white dwarfs and two additional white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission appear single . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of near - ir excess from the apparently single white dwarfs suggests that either x - ray observations are more effective than near - ir photometry in diagnosing faint companions or a different emission mechanism is needed . </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing that 50% of the six apparently single white dwarfs with hard x - ray emission are among the hottest white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared x - ray properties of 11 hot white dwarfs with different spectral types , and conclude that stellar pulsation and fast stellar winds are not likely the origin of the hard x - ray emission , but a leakage of the high - energy wien tail of emission from deep in the stellar atmosphere remains a tantalizing source of hard x - ray emission from hot do and dqzo white dwarfs . a complete survey using the entire @xmath1 pspc archive </S>",
