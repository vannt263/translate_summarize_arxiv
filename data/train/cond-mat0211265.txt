    "there are two approaches to the analysis of the static and dynamic properties of magnetic materials : discrete microscopic and macroscopic .",
    "the microscopic approach is based on a discrete spin hamiltonian in which the spins @xmath13 ( quantum or treated quasi - classically , as will be done below ) are specified at the lattice sites @xmath14 . in discrete models the magnetic anisotropy can be introduced in two different ways : as single - ion anisotropy , and as anisotropy of the exchange interaction . to describe them ,",

    ", all tensors describing volume characteristics can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "the tensor function @xmath20 is nonzero only near the surface and abruptly decreases in the depth of the sample .",
    "the surface creates another chosen direction , a normal to it , and enters a local system of coordinates , in which the tensor @xmath20 is diagonal .",
    "we neglect in the hamiltonian a dipole - dipole coupling and a zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field .",
    "we shall use a simple version of with an uniaxial symmetry for the bulk properties ( @xmath21 as a chosen axis , for definiteness ) and with nearest neighbors interaction only : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the exchange integral , @xmath24 is the anisotropy parameter of the exchange interaction , and @xmath25 are the vectors of the nearest neighbors , the summation over @xmath26 in the last term includes only the surface sites , where the number of the nearest neighbors differs from the volume one .",
    "to more adequately compare the lattice and continuum models , we assume that the vector @xmath6 is a normal to the surface , but not a direction given by the miller indices .",
    "the sign of the exchange integral plays no role for the statics of non - frustrated magnets with a bipartite lattice .",
    "moreover , a model without dipole - dipole coupling is more adequate for antiferromagnets than ferromagnets . for simplicity we use below the ferromagnetic representation of spin distributions ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 . the transition to the antiferromagnetic case for a bipartite lattice is trivial : we introduce sublattices and change the directions of the spins in one of them .",

    "it is clear that the measure of inhomogeneity depends on the problem parameters and the sample shape .",
    "a simple consideration shows that for the fixed shape there are only two relevant parameters .",
    "the first one is the characteristic radius @xmath37 , where @xmath38 at @xmath39 or @xmath40 at @xmath41 is the magnetic length , defined in the same way as for bulk materials.@xcite the second parameter is the ratio of the exchange integral to the surface anisotropy @xmath42 . to simplify analysis we consider a model with a purely planar spin distribution .",

    "as we will see below such a model demonstrates a wide set of inhomogeneous states and allows complete analytical and numerical investigations .",
    "we restrict ourselves the case of one more simplification , namely , a model which allows @xmath11 spatial spin distributions , i.e. such distributions which depend only on two spatial variables , say @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "apparently such a simplification is applicable to an island of a magnetic monoatomic layer shaped as a disk . for numerical simulation",
    "we will choose a fragment of the two - dimensional square lattice in the form of a disk .",
    "however , applicability of obtained results is not limited by this concrete case .",
    "it is easy to imagine situations when the same spatial - two - dimensional distribution is realized . as an example one can regard a ferromagnetic particle with the volume easy - plane anisotropy , having a form of a cylinder with the base parallel to the easy - plane ( the @xmath49-plane ) and with the axis along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "if one considers that the surface anisotropy constant @xmath8 in is positive then the normal to the surface is the hard axis of the surface anisotropy .",
    "it is clear , that any planar spin distribution with @xmath50 ensures both the minimum of the volume and the surface anisotropy on the upper and bottom cylinder surfaces . in this case",
    "non - uniformity is caused only by the lateral cylinder surface , and one can expect that the distribution will be a spatial - two - dimensional one , with the same character as for the purely two - dimensional problem .",

    "it is worth to note that according to the analytical consideration the centered vortex presents at any @xmath8 and its energy does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "besides that state there exist non - centered vortices stabilized by the lattice pinning . since the state with non - centered vortex at the finite @xmath60 is not an exact solution ( unlike to the non - singular case ) , they will be analyzed numerically in the next subsection with a simple qualitative model of pinning . at large enough anisotropy the energies of non - centered vortices",

    "such states are frequently observed in numeric simulations for the discrete model when initial configurations for the minimization are chosen randomly .",
    "although a detailed analysis of thermal fluctuations and decay of metastable states is beyond the scope of this work , their role can be discussed on the basis of the previous estimates .",
    "the above introduced @xmath164 is the radius of the region where pinning disappears , i.e. at @xmath170 the barrier height separating states with a vortex placed in adjacent lattice sites , becomes to zero .",

    "their analysis is similar to the one that has performed for the case of a non - centered vortex .",
    "two pinned charges on the border can be approached only down to the angle @xmath184 .",

    "inside of two topologically different classes of states  with vortex or with two surface singularities  effective relaxation to the most favorable state inside of the given class is possible .",
    "however , the previous results show that the vortex - like configurations with the centered vortex have higher energy than the two - charge configuration , and are metastable",
    ". therefore , the state with centered vortex may relax toward the most profitable state with two surface singularities .",
    "the simplest scenario of the vortex decay is the following .",

    "its value does not contain the parameter @xmath187 , but it is proportional to @xmath188 and is much higher that the exchange energy @xmath141 .",

    "it is interesting to compare these results to those which have been obtained for fine particles made with soft magnetic materials such as permalloy magnetic dots , where the non - uniform states are caused by the magnetic - dipole interaction .",
    "the common point for these cases is not only the presence of the vortex state but also the presence of non - topological non - uniform states , leaf or flower states.@xcite the distinction consists in the fact that for soft magnetic particles there are non - singular vortices with the out - of - plane magnetization component while in our problem with the strong bulk anisotropy the only in - plane vortices with a singularity are presence .",
    "it is likely that in virtue of this for permalloy particles there is a very much pronounced transition from the vortex state to the non - topological one with the system size decreasing , while in our problem the vortex state is always less favorable energetically .",
    "it is worth to note that our preliminary numerical data indicate the appearance of such a transition at a weak easy - plane anisotropy ; an extended discussion of this problem is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the spin distribution in the non - singular state of our @xmath11 problem resembles the distribution having axial symmetry and the plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis obtained by dimitrov and wysin @xcite for @xmath191 particles where both the volume and surface anisotropies are presented .",
    "recently , the stable three - dimensional analog of vortices , hedgehog configuration has been discovered for a ball - shaped particle with strong normal border anisotropy by numeric calculations.@xcite on the other hand , for the superfluid @xmath94he - a , which is defined in terms of our model by use of the infinitely strong surface anisotropy and isotropic volume properties , the true minimum constitutes less symmetric state ( boojum , or fountain ) with one surface singularity and without the symmetry plane.@xcite in our case the  boojum - like  distribution appears only for non - stable saddle point , which separates the vortex and non - singular states .",

    "<S> states.@xcite when increasing the size of the dot above a critical value , vortex state occurs.@xcite the main property of such states is the non - saturating value of the total dot magnetization , nearly zero for vortex states and nearly saturated , but smaller that saturated , for leaf and flower states .    </S>",
    "<S> oshea and coworkers@xcite have observed non - saturated states for the rare - earth ferromagnetic granules with high anisotropy and the size about of 5 nm . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation of this fact is that these particles are in non - uniform states . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the concepts of non - uniform states referred to above and caused by a magnetic dipole interaction can not be applied directly to such small particles made with highly - anisotropic material . in this concern , </S>",
    "<S> some other sources of non - uniformity need to be found .    the appearance of non - uniform states for small _ bcc _ atomic clusters with taking into account the _ single - ion _ surface anisotropy have been shown numerically by dimitrov and wysin.@xcite garanin and kachkachi in the resent work@xcite investigated the effective anisotropy caused by such a non - uniform spin distribution for small magnetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the properties of the spins on the surface and in bulk could be considered as a defect destroying the homogeneity of a sample . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that due to the surface a homogeneous ordering is distorted or even broken .    </S>",
    "<S> in real magnets the surface could produce the surface anisotropy for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the main origin of magnetic anisotropy can be caused by the anisotropy of spin - spin interactions ( the case of _ exchange _ anisotropy ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this case even on an ideal atomically smooth surface the spins have different coordination numbers than in bulk , and consequently the intensity of the exchange interaction changes . for the surface exchange </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy the direction of the chosen axis is the same as in bulk and has no connection to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this effect could lead to the non - uniform states in some special cases only , mostly in the presence of an external magnetic field , for example the surface spin - flop transition,@xcite and the states caused by the magnetic field for easy - axial ferromagnets.@xcite second , in real magnets surface atoms have a different environmental symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the surface distorts a crystalline field that acts on a magnetic ion , and the anisotropy is changed drastically . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a specific _ single - ion _ surface anisotropy for the spins with a preferred axis coinciding with the normal to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this model is considered by dimitrov and wysin for _ fcc _ iron clusters;@xcite we would like to investigate this case both analytically and numerically . note that the surface effects , in particular , the surface anisotropy , have been considered by many authors,@xcite but in most of these works the ground states has been assumed to be homogeneous , and the surface terms are only accounted in dynamics . on the other hand , it is obvious that for fine magnetic particles the role of the surface becomes much more important than for bulk materials . </S>",
    "<S> the effects cased by the surface considered as a defect are proportional to @xmath0 , and their role increases when the size of the particle tends to the nanometer scales .    </S>",
    "<S> note that similar problems arise in the other domains of condensed matter physics , where a role of surface is important . </S>",
    "<S> these are textures in liquid crystals@xcite and in a superfluid @xmath1he , see.@xcite for the a - phase of @xmath1he ( @xmath1he - a ) the unit vector order parameter @xmath2 , @xmath3 is perpendicular to the surface of a vessel . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1he can not be in equilibrium with its own vapor ; it fills the vessel completely at temperatures when it is superfluid ( @xmath4mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the vector @xmath2 should be perpendicular to the surface of the @xmath1he - a sample . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that the order parameter becomes non - uniform , and , moreover , it is singular for any simply - connected vessel.@xcite    it is clear that such effects may be observed in all finite samples of ordered media with vector order parameter and a strong surface anisotropy of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the normal to the surface , @xmath7 is the order parameter , and @xmath8 is the constant of single - ion surface anisotropy , which orients @xmath7 with respect to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath1he - a , the boundary condition could be described as a limit of an _ infinitely strong _ surface anisotropy @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with easy axis perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the concept developed for @xmath1he - a could be a good guide for a theory of fine magnetic particles with surface anisotropy . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the situation for magnets is more general : the magnitude of the surface anisotropy for magnets is finite , and the magnetic moment could be inclined with respect to the axis of surface anisotropy . as we will show below finiteness of anisotropy </S>",
    "<S> could lead to the states with non - uniform spin distributions but without singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : model ] we discuss classical models for a small magnetic particle supporting simplest non - uniform spin distribution , caused by surface anisotropy , which is planar and two - dimensional ( @xmath11 ) model . </S>",
