    "ten years ago , observations of the recurrent x - ray transient  with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) revealed coherent 2.5  ms pulsations , establishing this source as the first known accretion - powered millisecond pulsar ( amp ; @xcite ) .",
    "its immediate recognition as the `` missing link '' in which old pulsars are spun up to millisecond periods by accretion in an x - ray binary was only the beginning of what can be learned from this class of sources : among other areas of theoretical interest , amps continue to reveal insights into the nature of magnetically channeled accretion flow , the torques that act upon neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and the orbital evolution of these systems .",

    "the second harmonic had less excess timing noise , so it was weighted more heavily when estimating the overall pulse toas . with these pulse toa estimates , we used tempo to fit an improved timing model . by iteratively re - folding the data , estimating the pulse toas , and fitting a new model , we converged on our best - fit timing model .",
    "uncertainties in our frequency measurements were estimated using monte carlo simulations , following the prescription of h08 .",

    "the light curve of the main body of the outburst is remarkably similar the light curve observed in 2005 , which is included in figure  [ fig : outburst ] for comparison .",
    "the 2008 outburst is slightly dimmer ( maximum 2.525  kev flux of @xmath16  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1 ) and its light curve has two maxima , but the outburst rise , the length of the peak , and the slow decay down to @xmath5@xmath18  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1are nearly identical .",
    "the flaring tail of the new outburst is markedly dimmer . during the two previous outbursts for which the tail was observed immediately following the main outburst ( 2002 and 2005 ) , the flares were quasiperiodic with a 46  d time scale , and the 2.525  kev flux varied between @xmath14@xmath19  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1  and @xmath18  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1 .",
    "the source remained consistently detectable for at least a month following the main outburst .",
    "in contrast , the brightest observations during the tail of the 2008 outburst only reach @xmath20  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1 , and during oct 1317 , the source was not detectable at all with the _ rxte _  ( @xmath14@xmath19  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1sensitivity ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the intermittent detections during the tail of the 2000 outburst @xcite .",
    "most of the pulse profiles were similar to what we observed during the earlier outbursts : profiles 13 of figure  [ fig : outburst ] closely resemble profiles 13 in figure  3 of h08 .",
    "the evolution of the pulse shape progresses in the same way .",
    "as seen in the 2005 and ( to a lesser extent ) 2002 outbursts , a symmetric pulse during the burst rise becomes increasingly skewed during the burst peak . in the phase residuals ,",
    "this pulse shape change manifests as a progressively increasing phase of the fundamental , while the phase of the second harmonic remains constant ; this behavior can be seen during mjd 5473254735 in the phase offset plot of figure  [ fig : outburst ] .",
    "since these pulse shape changes confuse measurement of the spin phase , we omit the outburst rise and early peak ( points before mjd 54735 ) from our timing models .",
    "this choice is admittedly somewhat arbitrary , as the pulse profile continues to change throughout the outburst , albeit more slowly .",
    "however , this same region was omitted from the analysis of the earlier outbursts in h08 , so we remove it here so that our frequency measurements are directly comparable .",
    "the clear double peaks of profile  4 are an exception to these similarities in the pulse shape evolution .",
    "this profile folds 8.2  ks of data during mjd 54743.254744.0 .",

    "was a second peak so prominent , and the weak secondary peaks that were observed occured exclusively during the flaring tail , when the source was a factor of 23 dimmer .",
    "the most unusual timing feature of this outburst is the presence of abrupt shifts of the fundamental s phase during the outburst tail .",
    "these phase jumps are clear at mjd 54770 and 54774 in the phase offset plot of figure  [ fig : outburst ] , at which times the fundamental phases are 0.20.3 cycles earlier than predicted by the constant - frequency model shown .",
    "the observations with earlier phases were folded and summed to produce profile  6 , and their phases are marked by circles .",
    "the rest of the observations in the tail were folded to produce profile  5 , and after mjd 54760 their phases are marked by squares . while substantial phase shifts have been observed in the previous outbursts of  ( compare fig .  2 of @xcite and fig .  1 of h08 ) , these jumps were particularly large and rapid . during the 23  hours between the observations on mjd 54770 and 54771 ,",
    "the phase shifted by 0.26  cycles ; during the single observation on mjd 54775 , the phase shifted by 0.20  cycles in 40  minutes .",
    "these shifts are due in part to differing pulse shapes .",
    "the centroid of the pulse  to which the fundamental is most sensitive  arrives appreciably earlier in profile  6 , but the peaks of the two profiles are separated by a smaller difference .",
    "however , this nuance is lost unless many observations are folded together ( as in the displayed profiles ) , and for most observations in the tail only the fundamental is available for pulse timing .    given this limitation , the inclusion of these phase measurements of the fundamental in our timing models is subject to interpretation .",
    "if these points are all excluded , the phase residuals for mjd 5473554760 give a frequency of 400.97521012(3 )  hz .",
    "( parenthetical digits give @xmath22 estimates of the uncertainties . )",
    "if the circled points are used and the square points excluded , the timing solution requires a large apparent spin up to account for the advancing phases in the outburst tail .",
    "its frequency rises at a rate @xmath23  hz  s@xmath1 from a value of @xmath24 at the start of the outburst .",
    "this fit is indicated by the dotted line in the phase offset panel of figure  [ fig : outburst ] .",
    "it does not completely eliminate the jumps : a substantial difference ( 0.16  cycles ) remains between the points around mjd 54770 and 54774 .",
    "on the other hand , if we only include the square points in the outburst tail , the data are consistent with a constant spin frequency of @xmath25  hz .",
    "this selection eliminates all phase jumps greater than 0.1  cycles .",
    "finally , if we include all the points in the tail , we get @xmath26  hz  s@xmath1 and @xmath27 , although the phase jumps result in a poor fit and large uncertainties .    ultimately we are most interested in these frequency measurements to determine whether the long - term spin down observed in h08 has continued , and on this point the data are clear : regardless of our assumptions , the estimated spin frequency at the start of the 2008 outburst is less than the 2005 frequency of 400.97521019(2 )  hz ( h08 ) . fitting a constant slope through the frequencies observed for the five outbursts",
    "yields a long - term spin - down rate of @xmath28  hz  s@xmath1 , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : timing ] .",
    "this rate and figure use the 2008 timing model obtained when we only include the square points ; we prefer this model on physical grounds ( see  [ sect : discphasejumps ] ) .",
    "that said , using the @xmath29 frequency from the model for only the circled points does not greatly alter the result , slightly increasing its magnitude to @xmath30  hz  s@xmath1 .",
    "however , the 2008 point becomes an outlier and the @xmath31 of the fit increases .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the spin down of @xmath32  hz  s@xmath1 found for the 19982005 outbursts ( h08 ) .",
    "the frequency uncertainties estimated using our monte carlo simulations give @xmath33 with 3  degrees of freedom . to account for this large @xmath31 , we scaled up the frequency uncertainties such that the reduced @xmath31 is unity when calculating the uncertainty for @xmath34 .",
    "the fit is not particularly sensitive to the source position : shifting it by @xmath22 along the ecliptic ( using the uncertainty from the optical position in h08 ) changes the spin down by @xmath35  hz  s@xmath1 .",
    "no position significantly decreases the @xmath31 of the linear trendline .",
    "the farthest outlier from a constant frequency derivative is the 2000 outburst , of which we only observed the flaring tail .",
    "as noted in h08 , this frequency measurement may be complicated by small systematic differences in the observed pulse frequency between the main outburst and its tail , which were observed during the 1998 and 2002 outbursts .",
    "removing this outburst lowers the @xmath31 to 1.9 ( 2 degrees of freedom ) , consistent with a constant derivative , and changes the long - term spin down to @xmath36  hz  s@xmath1 .",
    "the measured time of ascending node continues to advance relative to a constant orbital period .",
    "a quadratic provides a good fit ( @xmath37 with 2  degrees of freedom ) , consistent with a constant orbital period derivative of @xmath38  s  s@xmath1 .",
    "this measurement is @xmath39 greater than the value in h08 .",
    "it is in good agreement with @xcite , which measured the orbital phase of the 2008 outburst using _ xmm - newton _ data .",

    ".    proper interpretation of the phase residuals hinges on an accurate handling of the orbital parameters , particularly the orbital period , due to the sparsity of data in the outburst s tail . from the orbital parameters derived by connecting the advancing orbital phases of the 19982005 outbursts ( h08 ) , we extrapolate a 2008 orbital period of 7249.15763(6 )",
    "s. including the 2008 outburst s phase , this method gives 7249.15771(2 )  s. fitting the orbital parameters using the fundamental for the first half of the ouburst only ( cf .  @xcite ) or using only the second harmonic give compatible periods of 7249.160(3 )  s and 7249.153(5 )  s , respectively .",

    "the presence of double - peaked pulse profiles during the 2008 outburst was notable both because two peaks were so well defined ( compare with the weaker secondary peaks shown in fig .  3 of h08 ) and because they occurred while the outburst was still relatively bright : 23 times more luminous than when double - peaked profiles were first seen during the 2002 and 2005 outbursts .",
    "h08 speculated that the appearance of a second peak may be caused by the recession of the accretion disk as the accretion rate drops , revealing the star s antipodal hot spot .",
    "@xcite went further , estimating from magnetic accretion theory and geometric considerations that the appearance of the antipodal hot spot at fluxes of @xmath54  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1  during 2002 and 2005 would imply a surface magnetic field of @xmath55@xmath56  g.    the detection of double - peaked profiles at @xmath57  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath1  during 2008 requires this field estimate to be increased somewhat , although its weak dependence on flux ( @xmath58 in eq .",
    "14 of @xcite ) means that is still not in conflict with the @xmath59  g limit implied by the long - term spin down ( h08 ; see also  [ sect : discspindown ] ) .",
    "more troublesome is the question of why the second spot does not remain visible as the accretion rate continues to drop .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a change in the geometry or inner radius of the disk that temporarily reveals the antipodal hot spot but has no impact at all on the accretion rate and flux , as is the case here .",
    "more exotic explanations , such as a temporary bifurcation of the accretion column to produce two hot spots , may be needed ; simulations have suggested that such configurations are easily possible if higher - order field components are present @xcite .",
    "the large phase jumps in the tail of the 2008 outburst are the most unusual feature of the pulse profiles , with the phase of the fundamental in one case jumping by 0.20  cycles in only 40  minutes .",
    "clearly these are not changes in the rotational phase of the ns , which complicates their inclusion while constructing a timing solution .",
    "we considered two extremes : that the earlier points reflected the ns spin phase , which necessitated a spin up of @xmath60  hz  s@xmath1 ; and that the later points tracked the spin , in which case a constant - frequency timing solution provides a good fit .",
    "we prefer the latter case on physical grounds . from standard magnetic accretion torque theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "an accretion rate of @xmath61 can impart a maximum torque of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the co - rotation radius of the ns and @xmath64 is its moment of inertia .",
    "estimating @xmath65 , we find the maximum spin up of @xmath66 here we use the bolometric correction @xmath67 and distance @xmath68 from @xcite and canonical values for the ns parameters .",
    "integrating this expression for the observed flux over the 40  d outburst outburst , we can approximate a physical upper limit for the total spin up of @xmath69  @xmath11hz .",
    "for the earlier points to reflect the spin phase , the frequency shift would need to be @xmath70  hz  s@xmath71  @xmath11hz .",
    "unless the source s luminosity underestimates the accretion rate by a factor of a few , these points can not reflect the ns spin phase .    of course , it is possible that the ns spin phase lies somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "based on the data available , we can not exclude the possibility of a spin up during the outburst .",
    "indeed , though the confidence intervals in 19982005 include zero , they are biased toward a positive @xmath34 ( h08 ) , suggestive that a small sytematic spin up may be present .",
    "the observed long - term spin down of  produces a loss of rotational energy at a rate of @xmath72  erg  s@xmath1 , assuming a canonical value of @xmath73  g  @xmath12 for the ns moment of inertia .",
    "this spin down acts on the ns during quiescence ( h08 ) , and it is consistent with a constant rate over the ten years of observation .",
    "we consider three possible torques : magnetic dipole radiation , the centrifugal expulsion of matter from the inner accretion disk by the magnetic field ( the so - called `` propeller effect '' ) , and gravitational radiation due to a mass quadrupole moment of the ns .",
    "we assume that these independent mechanisms contribute additively to the observed spin - down luminosity , @xmath74 .",
    "the presence of pulsations during the outburst peaks requires @xmath75 to truncate the accretion flow above the ns surface ( @xcite ; h08 ) .",
    "this lower limit implies a magnetic dipole contribution of @xmath76 .",
    "if the field strength is only a few times higher , @xmath2  g , then magnetic dipole radiation would account for the entirety of the long - term spin down .",
    "these tight limits on @xmath77 leave a very small window for other mechanisms .",
    "their contribution would have to be within a single order of magnitude of the contribution from magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "given the wide physical ranges available to these independent spin - down torques , such a coincidence is unlikely .",
    "additionally , the long - term spin down is consistent with a constant rate , as would be expected if @xmath78 dominates ; the constancy of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is very model dependent .",
    "independent estimates of the magnetic field strength suggest that @xmath77 is toward the upper end of our allowed interval .",
    "@xcite noted that if the rapid dimming at the end of the main outburst is due to the onset of the propeller effect ( as suggested by other outburst properties , e.g. , @xcite ) , it would imply @xmath81  g. as noted in the previous section , the appearance of double - peaked pulse profiles in the tail suggest a similar field strength @xcite .",
    "the detection of a relativistically broadened iron line during the 2008 outburst also suggests a higher field of @xmath82  g @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , it is likely that magnetic dipole radiation provides the dominant torque .",
    "the cause of the orbital period derivative remains a subject of debate .",
    "h08 , @xcite , and @xcite show that it can not be accounted for solely by conservative transfer from the low - mass companion to the ns .",
    "we consider two alternatives : the ejection of mass from the system due to the ablation of the companion , and the influence of short - term effects that can exchange angular momentum between the companion and the orbit .    _ ejection of matter due to the ablation of the companion .",
    "_ if magnetic dipole torque is the predominant contributor to the spin down of , as suggested in the previous section , then the source may behave like a rotation - powered pulsar during quiescence , producing radio pulsations and a particle wind .",
    "while no radio pulsations have been detected @xcite , the upper limits are not particularly constraining .",
    "however , during quiescence the system is substantially brighter in the optical than expected @xcite .",
    "this optical excess may be due to the heating of the companion by a particle wind @xcite .",
    "if this particle wind ejects a large amount of matter from the system , it could explain the rapid orbital period change .",
    "for a companion modeled with a polytropic index of @xmath83 ( representative of a degenerate or fully convective star ) , a mass loss of @xmath14@xmath84  yr@xmath1 would be needed to yield the observed @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "is the spin - down luminosity of @xmath85  erg  s@xmath1 sufficient to drive such mass loss ?",
    "assuming that it is radiated isotropically , the incident luminosity onto the companion is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the companion radius and @xmath88 is the binary separation . since the companion fills its roche lobe , @xmath89 for a mass ratio of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the resulting luminosity onto the companion is @xmath91  erg  s@xmath1 . assuming perfect efficiency , that incident luminosity can drive a mass loss of @xmath92  yr@xmath1 .",
    "thus this scenario for orbital evolution is energetically feasible .",
    "nevertheless , some serious problems with this model remain . a particle wind sufficient to eject over 95% of @xmath93 from the system , as necessitated by this model , would also drive away the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite suggest that outbursts therefore occur when the pressure of matter driven from the companion temporarily exceeds the radiation pressure .",
    "however , the outburst of  and the other amps look quite similar to some of the outbursts form other lmxbs , both in time scales and shape . the disk instability model has been generally successful in explaining the light curves of soft x - ray transients in general ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and amps in particular @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile these similarities in light curve shape and time scale with a very different mechanism governing the outbursts of .    _ short - term changes in the orbital period .",
    "_ alternatively , the observed @xmath45 may not be representative of the secular evolution , but is instead due to some short - term interchange of angular momentum between the companion and the orbit .",
    "similarly large orbital period derivatives are present in two so - called `` black widow '' millisecond radio pulsars , and these period derivatives have been observed to change sign on a @xmath1410  yr time scale @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that tidal dissipation and magnetic activity in the companion are responsible for the orbital variability , requiring that the companion is at least partially non - degenerate , convective , and magnetically active @xcite .",
    "eclipse timing of the lmxb exo  0748@xmath53676 also shows rapid variation in the orbital period ; explanations for the exchange of angular momentum include a `` wobble '' of the companion s inertial moments due to differential rotation and convection produced by its uneven heating @xcite .",
    "however , in all the above systems , the orbital period derivatives change over @xmath9410  yr .",
    "while this does not definitively prove that the @xmath45 of  is secular , it would make this source an exception .",
