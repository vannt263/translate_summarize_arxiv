    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are the evolved descendants of the most massive stars ( @xmath4 ; see crowther 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "they are highly luminous ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) and drive ferocious winds , which , when integrated over the entire wr phase , can deposit an amount of mechanical energy comparable to that released by a supernova blast . as the strong winds of wrs eject hydrogen and helium from their atmospheres , deeper and hotter layers containing the byproducts of core nuclear burning are exposed .",
    "the high temperatures and fast winds result in the development of strong , velocity - broadened emission lines of helium , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "based on the observed relative strengths of these lines , wrs are classified into spectral subtype categories of nitrogen type ( wn ) , carbon type ( wc ) , and oxygen type ( wo ) .",
    "these subtypes are believed to follow the general evolutionary sequence : wn@xmath7wc@xmath7wo ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . as wrs",
    "are hydrogen deficient upon death , they are suspected to be the progenitors of type ib and ic core - collapse supernovae and long - duration gamma - ray bursts . with ages of @xmath810 myr ,",
    "wrs are excellent markers of recent massive star formation .",
    "their population demographics provide insight on the formation mode and distribution of the most massive stars in the galaxy , while the observed frequencies of wr subtypes as a function of environmental metallicity provide a useful testing ground for evolutionary models ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) .    prior to this work , there were upward of 400 cataloged wrs .",
    "those that lie relatively close to the sun have bright optical counterparts @xcite and this local population is estimated to be complete to @xmath9 mag ( shara et al .",
    "based on the local wr space density , a simple extrapolation implies that @xmath06500 wrs populate the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the lifetime of wr precursors is @xmath810 myr , they are unable to drift far from their birthplaces in molecular clouds before the end of their lives .",
    "hence , from the vantage point of earth , the vast majority of galactic wrs lie in regions of high optical obscuration .",
    "fortunately , infrared observations have the ability to unveil wrs in such environments .",
    "large populations of obscured wrs have been revealed in regions of the galaxy for which astronomical interest is relatively biased , such as the galactic center ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and extraordinary starburst clusters such as westerlund 1 @xcite .",
    "more recently , infrared - based searches for wrs have been extended to the greater galactic plane .",
    "@xcite have identified 41 obscured wrs via infrared narrow - band imaging and follow - up spectroscopy . meanwhile , complementary efforts by @xcite and @xcite have utilized the 2mass and _ spitzer_/glimpse point - source catalogs to develop a very efficient color - based criterion for selecting wr candidates from the field . this work is a continuation of that effort .",
    "we report the detection of 60 new wrs , which brings the current total number of wrs selected by our method to @xmath090 .",
    "the color - based criterion has been refined since our last major discovery report in mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , leading to an enhanced detection rate for wrs and a better suppression of non - wr  contaminating \" sources .",
    "wrs are significant sources of infrared excess .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that they are clearly separable from the vast majority of field stars in @xmath10 versus @xmath11 , @xmath12)$ ] versus @xmath13 , and @xmath14-[8.0])$ ] versus @xmath14-[4.5])$ ] color - color diagrams .",
    "the color excesses are mainly the result of free - free emission from _ _ e__@xmath15 scattering off of helium ions in the outer regions of their dense winds ( wright & barlow 1975 ; cohen et al . 1975 ) .",
    "broad emission lines and thermal emission from hot dust for a subset of wc stars can provide additional color excess ( e.g. , see williams et al .",
    "1987 ) . to illustrate the extent by which line emission contributes to the infrared excess of wrs , we removed the emission lines from the flux - calibrated spectra of selected objects in our sample and used the stsdas synphot package in iraf to generate synthetic @xmath16 photometry from the pure - continuum photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : cc_lines ] illustrates the resulting shift in @xmath10 and @xmath11 color that several wrs experience after their line emission was removed .",
    "selected wn stars from our sample do not undergo a significant color shift as a result of emission lines , which probably explains why wn stars form a relatively tight trend in the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 color space of figure 1 . however , wc stars undergo a significant shift in @xmath17 color if their emission lines are removed . the effect is mainly driven by very strong emission from c iv and c iii in the @xmath18-band .",
    "relative to the continuum , wr line strengths decrease with increasing wavelength , so , line emission has a much smaller effect on broad - band colors of wrs in the mid - infrared .",
    "the infrared excesses of wrs shown forms the basis of a selection criterion within the area of sky covered by the 2mass and _ spitzer_/glimpse surveys of the inner galaxy ( @xmath19@xmath20 , @xmath20@xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; benjamin et al .",
    "the color space used in this work has been expanded to encompass more distant and highly obscured wr candidates that lie along the reddening vector .",
    "furthermore , we determined that the inclusion of color - magnitude restrictions provides an additional  sieve \" for separating wrs from non - wr  contaminants \" .",
    "the color spaces bounded by solid lines in figure 1 were defined by the color distributions of all known wrs having @xmath1 mag ( the galactic wr sample is already complete to @xmath9 mag ; shara et al .",
    "1999 ) we will hereafter refer to the spaces defined by the black lines in figure 1 , collectively , as the _ broad color space_. known wrs of all subtypes occupy this space , including dusty wc stars .",
    "there are @xmath06600 unidentified wr candidates in the space having @xmath23 mag ; these have become targets for spectroscopic characterization .",
    "focusing on the brightest sources with @xmath24 mag , we have experienced a @xmath020% detection rate for wrs in the broad color space . in an attempt to increase the wr detection rate",
    ", we experimented with selecting candidates from smaller color subspaces in the @xmath12)$ ] versus @xmath13 , and @xmath14-[8.0])$ ] versus @xmath14-[4.5])$ ] spaces where non - wr  contaminants \" are relatively sparse ; we will refer to these color subspaces , collectively , as the  _ wr sweet spot _ \" .",
    "as expected , the wr detection rate increased significantly to upward of @xmath050% , and the rate of wc type detection also increased notably .",
    "it is not entirely clear what infrared spectral and extinction properties drive wr colors into the sweet spot or what subtype selection biases result from selecting candidates from this color region .",
    "a clue might lie in the fact that the detection rate for wc stars in the sweet spot increased relative to the detection rate using the broad color criterion .",
    "the strong line emission from c iii and c iv in the @xmath25-band could explain the sweet spot in the ( @xmath26[8.0 ] ) versus ( @xmath27 ) color space ( moving strong - lined wc stars blueward in @xmath25-[8.0 ] axis and redward in @xmath27 axis ) , but emission - line effects are probably less significant for the @xmath28-[8.0]$ ] versus @xmath28-[4.5]$ ] , because the line strengths of wrs relative to the continuua decreases significantly in the mid - infrared .",
    "it is also plausible that the wr sweet spot is produced , in part , by the relative strength of free - free emission for particular subtypes , which could be the cause of the enhanced detection rate of wc types in this subspace .",
    "whatever the case , it should be noted that representatives from most wn and wc subtypes are found within the wr sweet spot , which suggests that there is no exclusive subtype bias in this particular color space with respect to the broader color space .",
    "however , the color distribution of dusty wc stars in figure 1 suggests that there will be some bias against these particular types in the wr sweet spot .",
    "additional work is needed to establish an improved understanding of the wr phenomenology in the infrared and the selection biases and limitations of our survey .",
    "the main goal of this work was to maximize the detection rate for galactic wrs , in order to best exploit the limited observing time made available for our program .",
    "we have , thus far , given precedence to the brightest wrs candidates in our sample ( @xmath24 mag ) , in order to expedite the discovery of new wrs . as a result , we have limited the galactic volume probed by our survey .",
    "for instance , by focusing the spectroscopic sample to objects having @xmath29 mag , we are mainly sensitive to wrs lying at distances of @xmath308 kpc , assuming an average @xmath31 and an average absolute magnitude of @xmath32 for wrs ( see crowther et al .",
    "according to @xcite , @xmath02500 galactic wrs ( @xmath040% ) are expected to have @xmath33 mag .",
    "most of these fainter wrs , which we have not yet sampled in our survey , will lie on the far half of the galaxy .",
    "thus our survey is strongly biased towards wr candidates on the near side of the galaxy .",
    "most of the non - wr stars selected in our survey exhibit the spectral characteristic of be stars .",
    "these objects exhibit h i paschen and brackett series emission in their spectra , shown in figure [ fig : be ] , which is consistent with the @xmath34 and @xmath18 spectral atlases of be iii  v stars from clark & steele ( 2000 ) and steele & clark ( 2001 ) .",
    "we suspect the reason that wrs and be stars have such similar infrared colors is a result of the similarities between the sources of their infrared excesses , which , in the case of be stars , is free - free emission generated by their ionized circumstellar disks . for both wr winds and",
    "be disks , the free - free flux is a function of electron density ( @xmath35 ) , electron temperature ( @xmath36 ) , the physical size of the emitting source ( @xmath37 ) , and the wavelength at which the emission becomes optically thick ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "all of these parameters are practically identical for wrs ( see cohen et al .",
    "1975 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2010b ) and be stars ( see gehrz et al .",
    "1974 ) , having typical values on the order of @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 k , @xmath4210@xmath43 cm , and @xmath44 .",
    "these physical similarities provide a simple and natural explanation for the infrared color spaces that wrs and be stars share .",
    "in addition to be stars , our method has also selected several candidate evolved b[e ] and o supergiants , and we suspect that these objects were also selected because of similarities in the free - free parameters . the discovery of these stars will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the refinement of the selection method in our most recent survey resulted in a significant improvement over our previous wr return rate of @xmath810% reported in @xcite .",
    "it appears that by including the recent color - magnitude restriction , the frequency of cool , late - type  contaminants \" has dropped significantly ( to @xmath45% ) since the surveys of hadfield et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . the broad color space , thus , returns early - type emission - line stars almost entirely , at a rate of @xmath095% .",
    "wrs are commonly x - ray sources ( see skinner et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "the high - energy emission is generated via shocks that form from line - driven instabilities within their winds ( lucy & white 1980 ) , or from the collision between opposing winds in a massive binary ( luo et al .",
    "thus , as a complementary wr selection technique , we cross - correlated our list of infrared color - selected wr candidates from the broad color space of figure 1 with archival x - ray catalogs that were compiled from multiple galactic plane observations made with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( evans et al .",
    "2010 ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( hands et al .",
    "we recovered 43 wr - candidate / x - ray matches , including several known wrs that were not previously recognized as x - ray sources .",
    "we obtained spectra for 23 of the candidates and recovered 10 wrs , for a return rate of @xmath040% , a factor - of - two increase in the return rate using the broad infrared color space alone .",
    "the non - wrs in this particular sample are , still , mainly be stars , but we also identified several candidate ysos , and late - type stars with infrared excess ; these objects will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the basic x - ray properties of these new wrs are presented in section 6 .",
    "although x - ray emission proves to be an effective tool for selecting wrs from the list of infrared - color candidates and improving the wr detection rate , there are certainly biases towards certain wr subtypes . for instance , although x - ray emission appears to be ubiquitous property of wn stars ( skinner et al .",
    "2010 ) , most wc stars are undetectable as x - ray sources ( oskinova et al . 2003 ) , unless they are members of colliding - wind binary systems .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray emission from single wrs is typically dominated by a soft x - ray photons having energies below 1 kev , which are heavily absorbed by the interstellar medium .",
    "thus , x - ray selection will be biased toward wrs in regions of lower extinction , or those that emit harder x - rays ( e.g. , colliding - wind binaries ) which are less attenuated by dust and gas along the intervening ism .",
    "near - infrared spectra of wr candidates was obtained with the palomar hale 5 m telescope and the triplespec ( tspec ) near - infrared spectrograph during 2009 july 1315 and 2010 june 21 ( ut ) , the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) and spex instrument during 2009 august 46 ( ut ) , and the southern observatory for astrophysical research ( soar ) and osiris spectrograph during 2010 may 2327 ( ut ) .",
    "tspec provides simultaneous coverage of the @xmath46 , @xmath34 , and @xmath18 bands ( @xmath472.4 ) and produces a moderate - resolution spectrum ( @xmath482700 ) through a @xmath49 slit .",
    "spex and osiris provide wavelength coverage similar to tspec , although at respective resolutions of @xmath50 through a 05 slit and @xmath51 through a 1 slit .",
    "all spectra were obtained utilizing an abba telescope nodding sequence for the subtraction of sky emission and to suppress bad pixels .",
    "for the tspec data , wavelength calibration was performed using the oh emission lines detected in the background sky spectra . for the spex and osiris data ,",

    "wr subtypes were assigned following the criteria of @xcite and @xcite , who demonstrated that wn subtypes can be classified quantitatively via the equivalent width ( ew ) ratios of the following helium emission lines : he ii ( @xmath541.012 ) /he",

    "the emission of high - ionization n v , relative to he i / c iii / n ii , can also be used as a subtype diagnostic @xcite .",
    "wc stars and their subtypes are classified in a manner similar to that of the wn stars via the ew ratios of the following carbon emission lines : c iii ( @xmath540.971 ) /c ii ( @xmath54 0.990 ) in the @xmath55 band , and c iv ( @xmath542.076 ) /c iii ( @xmath54 2.110 ) in the @xmath18 band .",
    "for wn stars , decreasing subtype is associated with an increase in the strength of he ii emission relative to he i ; while for wc stars , decreasing subtype is associated with an increase in the strength of c iv emission relative to c iii , and c iii relative to c ii .",
    "we measured ew values using the splot routine in iraf , whereby the individual flux contributions of blended emission lines may be recovered if the central wavelengths of the emission are known .",
    "however , emission - line  deblending \" was only necessary for the extraction of carbon line strengths in the @xmath18-band spectra of the wc stars that exhibit very strong emission lines of c iv and c iii .",
    "tables 3 and 4 list the ew values for prominent emission lines in the spectra of wn and wc stars , respectively , and the resulting subtype classifications .",
    "the new sample contains a total 38 wn stars and 22 wc stars .",
    "the majority of wn stars have subtypes in the wn67 range , exhibiting he ii ( @xmath542.189 ) /he ii@xmath56br@xmath57 ( @xmath542.165 ) ratios in the range of @xmath00.41.2 .",
    "earlier wn stars , such as mdm23 and mdm52 , exhibit slightly higher ratios of 1.6 and 2.5 , respectively , consistent with earlier subtypes in the range of wn45 .",
    "for the latest wn subtypes , he ii is substantially weaker than for the earlier wn types , as indicated by a comparison of their relatively low he ii ( @xmath542.189 ) /he",
    "ii@xmath56br@xmath57 ( @xmath542.165 ) ratios of @xmath300.2 .",
    "stars mdm8 and mdm19 have very weak features of he ii in their spectra . in the @xmath18-band",
    ", mdm8 appears to have this transition in absorption , which may be regarded as a feature more indicative of an o supergiant .",
    "however , in the @xmath34-band he ii possibly appears as a weak p cygni profile at @xmath541.692 , which would warrant the wn classification . for star mdm19 , he ii at @xmath542.189 appears to have a definite absorption component , while there might be some indication of an emission component having a p cygni profile , although it is too near the noise level to be regarded as a secure detection .",
    "thus , the spectral properties of mdm8 and mdm19 are mutually consistent with hot emission - line supergiants , possibly in transition to late wn stars . as an additional diagnostic",
    ", the strength of the br@xmath57 emission may help discriminate between o and wn types .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of o and hydrogen - rich wnh and wnha stars in bohannan & crowther ( 1999 ) suggest that o supergiants , such as hd 151804 , have ew ( br@xmath57 ) @xmath58  , whereas wn9 ha and wn9h stars exhibit higher strengths of @xmath020  and @xmath050  , respectively . following this rationale , we tentatively classify mdm8 as a wn9h star and mdm19 as a wn9 ha star , albeit with caution .",
    "higher @xmath53 data with increased spectral resolution is necessary to assign these stellar classifications with more confidence .",
    "star mdm50 has a particularly unique spectrum , which is dominated by emission lines of helium that are relatively narrow , compared with the other wrs .",
    "he  i at @xmath542.058 is the strongest line , with fwhm@xmath0300 km s@xmath59 , just above the 250 km s@xmath59 velocity resolution of the @xmath50 spectrum .",
    "the lower fwhm values of the other lines in the spectrum are consistent with the velocity resolution limit of the data , which suggests that the lines could be nebular in origin . in the @xmath18-band ,",
    "two resolved lines are apparent near @xmath542.165 ; their centroids lie at @xmath602.1622 , 2.1654 , which suggests that they could both be he transitions ( see @xcite , their table 2 ) , specifically he  i @xmath61@xmath62 at @xmath542.1622 , and he i @xmath63@xmath64 at @xmath542.1653 , although we identify these particular transitions with caution .",
    "there is also significant he ii emission at @xmath542.189 and @xmath541.012 .",
    "the @xmath34-band spectrum of mdm50 appears relatively devoid of any hydrogen emission features , which might also be an indication that the @xmath18-band emission feature at @xmath542.1654 is a transition of he and not br@xmath57 .",
    "there is , however , a potential emission line of h i ( @xmath65=10 - 4 ) at @xmath541.736 .",
    "there are also weak , but significant , features of low - ionization emission lines of na i at @xmath542.206 and mg ii at @xmath542.138 and @xmath542.144 , implying that the emission at @xmath541.736 could also have contribution from fe ii at the same wavelength ( e.g. , see morris et al .",
    "the presence of low - ionization features , accompanied by high - ionization he ii , is somewhat puzzling .",
    "the diagnostic line ratios we have used for the other wrs in our sample would imply a wn8 spectral type for mdm50 .",
    "however , the overall character of its spectrum and the narrowness of its spectral lines are not characteristic of any known wn8 star .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum is more similar to wr122 ( aka nast1 ) , classified as ofpe / wn9 star by figer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but re - classified as a hotter wr cloaked in an ionized nebula by crowther & smith ( 1999 ) .",
    "the spectrum of mdm50 is inconsistent with either of these phenomena .",
    "ofpe / wn9 stars typically exhibit much stronger emission from h i , particularly for the paschen series in the @xmath34 band @xcite .",
    "no h i emission has been detected from mdm50 .",
    "moreover , the cloaked wr nast1 exhibits a very strong thermal excess at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths ; mdm50 does not .",
    "finally , as we will demonstrate in the next section , the photometry for this source is also inconsistent with the supergiant luminosity class .",
    "late - type wc stars are commonly associated with thermal emission from hot circumstellar dust ( @xmath66@xmath67 k ) , which supplements the free - free emission produced by the stellar wind ( cohen et al .",
    "1975 ; williams et al .",
    "the significant near - infrared continuum excess can reduce the strengths of emission lines , particularly in the @xmath18 band .",
    "stars having c iii ( 0.97 ) / c iii ( 2.11 ) ratios that are relatively high ( @xmath0810 ) may be regarded as candidates for hot dust emission ( wcd stars ) , since there will be more dilution in the @xmath18 band than in the @xmath55 band .",
    "if @xmath55 band data are not available , stars that have generally weak lines in the @xmath18 band , as quantified by the sum of he i ( 2.06 ) c iv@xmath68c iii@xmath69he i ( 2.06 ) , can also be regarded as candidates for emission - line dilution by dust .",
    "however , stellar continuum emission from an unresolved ob companion can also dilute emission lines of the wr .",
    "thus , the sum of @xmath18-band line strengths is not a definitive indicator of dust dilution ; the c iii ( 0.97 ) / c iii ( 2.11 ) ratio is a much more reliable diagnostic .",
    "seven of the wc89 stars in our sample have the @xmath55-band coverage necessary for the calculation of the c iii ( 0.97 ) / c iii ( 2.11 ) ratio .",
    "mdm40 , mdm49 , and mdm60 have relatively high values of 9.8 , 8.9 , and 8.7 .",
    "of those , mdm40 and mdm60 also appear to be outliers having additional excess in the ( @xmath70 $ ] ) versus ( @xmath27 ) color space shown in figure 1 .",
    "there is also marginal evidence of this additional excess in the ( @xmath17 ) versus ( @xmath71 ) color space . mdm40 and mdm60 exhibit relatively weak emission lines in the @xmath18 band , shown in figure 6 , potentially the result of dilution from the thermal dust excess .",
    "mdm49 exhibits very strong lines in the @xmath18 band , however .",
    "mdm18 , mdm24 , mdm26 , and mdm58 also have relatively weak lines , yet , examining their colors with reference to figure 1 , these stars do not exhibit excesses with strength comparable to confirmed wcd stars ; mdm40 and mdm60 do , however . in conclusion ,",
    "mdm40 and mdm60 are the only newly identified wc stars to exhibit strong evidence for thermal dust emission , so , we classify them as wc89d stars . for hdm18 , hdm24 , hdm26 , hdm49 , and hdm58 , the evidence for hot - dust emission is less convincing , so , we classify them as wcd ? stars .",
    "using the photometric data from table 1 and the spectral type classifications in tables 3 and 4 , we computed the interstellar reddening of each source by adopting intrinsic @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 values for wr subtypes at known distances from crowther et al .",

    "the results of these calculations are listed in table [ tab : phot2 ] .",
    "the uncertainties are significant . following a rationale similar to that made by shara et al .",

    "( 2006 ) , which , although assigned to given subtype groups , exhibit significant scatter within those groups ( @xmath00.51 mag , depending on subtype ) .",
    "there is additional uncertainty as a result of scatter in the adopted intrinsic colors ( which is related to the intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitude for each subtype bin , and is a well known problem for hot stars with strong winds ) and in the adopted extinction law .",
    "it can be argued that the extinction properties along any highly reddened individual sightline are not well represented by a mean extinction curve ; however , the differences in the redundant calculations of @xmath83 , derived separately for the @xmath27 and @xmath17 colors , can be used as an indicator of the accuracy of our results .",

    "the galactic distribution in figure [ fig : wrdist ] is likely to be affected by significant scatter , which is certainly a partial consequence of the distance uncertainties .",
    "nonetheless , an overall concentration toward major spiral arms can be seen , while several regions of enhanced wr density also appear to punctuate the longitudinal distribution .",
    "however , we stress caution while interpreting figures [ fig : wrdist][fig : rg ] , since the coverage of wr surveys is not evenly distributed across the galactic plane . still , it is noteworthy that , although we ( i.e. , hadfield et al .",
    "2007 , mauerhan et al .",
    "2009 , and this work ) have sampled more of our wr candidates from the side of the galactic plane that is north of the galactic center ( @xmath134@xmath21 ) , we have experienced a slightly , but significantly , higher wr return rate for the southern side of the galactic center .",
    "we attribute this to the galactic spiral arm distribution with respect to our line of sight through the galactic plane .",
    "for example , the scutum - centaurus arm , one of the two main galactic arms illustrated in figure [ fig : wrdist ] , and the sagittarius arm , both run approximately parallel to our line of sight between @xmath135@xmath136 and @xmath137@xmath138 , respectively . as a result of this",
    ", there is more spiral arm coverage per unit longitude on the southern side of the galactic center than on the northern side , at least when considering the near - half of the galaxy , to which our survey has mainly been limited . since",
    "massive stars are presumably concentrated in spiral arms , we should expect a higher observed surface density of wrs on the southern side of the galaxy than the northern side .",
    "thus , although we approach the result with caution , owing to the non - uniformity and incompleteness of wr surveys across the galactic plane , we are confident that the peaks of enhanced wr surface density in the longitudinal distribution of figure [ fig : lplot ] are manifestations of real physical structure in the galaxy .",
    "the largest wr concentration is apparently toward the direction of the starburst cluster westerlund 1 , near @xmath139@xmath140 ; this line of sight pierces the scutum - centaurus arm perpendicularly , and beyond that , runs approximately parallel to the norma arm of the galaxy , which contains the @xmath024 wrs within westerlund 1 and @xmath010 more - distant , field wrs that lie @xmath034 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we experienced our highest wr return rate in this region of longitude ; during a particularly remarkable interval of observing time , while surveying wr candidates from the wr color  sweet spot , \" near @xmath141 , we confirmed 6 wrs consecutively , without interruption from non - wr  contaminants . \"",
    "based on this experience , we regard our remaining @xmath010 unobserved wr candidates from the sweet spot that lie near this longitude as particular promising .",
    "although not selected from our color - based survey , there is a strong concentration of wrs toward the galactic center . the central molecular zone , which comprises the central half - kiloparsec of the galaxy , contains 92 known wrs ( see mauerhan et al .",
    "2010a and references therein ) , @xmath070% of which are contained within the three known starburst clusters in the region : the arches , quintuplet , and central clusters .",
    "the region as a whole contains @xmath020% of the known galactic wr population . for this region of the galaxy , _ spitzer _ and 2mass observations suffer from extreme stellar confusion and very high extinction ( @xmath142 mag ) , which often prevents the detection of a @xmath46-band counterpart in 2mass .",
    "the resulting degradation of point - source photometry has limited our color - based selection to identify only one of the 92 wrs known in this region .",
    "thus , our method of wr selection is currently not effective in the galactic center or fields of comparable stellar confusion and extinction , such as , much of glimpse - ii .",
    "for the galactic plane on the northern side of the galactic center there are also several noteworthy concentrations of wrs .",
    "there is a peak near @xmath143 in figure [ fig : lplot ] .",
    "this line of sight pierces the base of the scutum - centaurus arm , where it intersects the galaxy s long bar , and also contains the w43 starburst region .",
    "vigorous star formation has occurred in this part of the galaxy over the last @xmath020 myr , as evidenced by the presence of the wr - bearing cluster w43 ( blum et al 1999 ) , four clusters of red supergiants between @xmath144@xmath145 (  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) , and an additional wr - bearing cluster at @xmath146 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "thus , the relatively high concentration of wrs here is not surprising .    figures [ fig : k1][fig : k4 ] show the 2mass @xmath25-band field images for new wrs that do not appear to be associated with a local ( @xmath302 ) stellar density enhancement ( exceptions will be discussed in section 7 ) .",
    "the relative  isolation \" of the new wrs motivates the question as to whether all wrs form exclusively in clusters and associations or form via an alternate mode of relatively isolated birth as well .",
    "it is possible that some of the wrs originated within clusters and associations , but were subsequently ejected dynamically , either by inter - cluster gravitational encounters or following the supernova explosion of an erstwhile companion ( moffat & isserstedt 1980 ; moffat et al .",
    "indeed , it has been noted that approximately half of all o stars exhibit kinematical evidence for runaway velocities ( de wit et al . 2004 , 2005 , and references therein ; dray et al . 2005 ) , and the same might be true for some of the wrs presented here , since they are descended from o stars .    we must also consider the possibility that stellar clusters of relatively low density and mass , when compared to massive , starburst systems , such as westerlund 1 , can persist undetected as a density enhancement because of background confusion .",
    "it is likely that many elusive clusters could populate the milky way , while being undetectable within existing near - infrared surveys , such as 2mass .",
    "such clusters have been referred to as  false negative \" clusters ( popescu & hanson 2009 ; hanson et al . 2010b ) in the following subsection , we present the discovery of wrs in one such false negative cluster that was not found by any previous cluster search algorithms .",

    "their respective distances of 6.2 and 6.0 kpc in table 5 are consistent with equivalent distance , given the @xmath1480.5 mag uncertainty in the adopted value of @xmath80 that we noted in section 5 , which results in a @xmath14925% uncertainty in distance .",
    "the average distance of @xmath06.1 kpc , implies a physical separation of @xmath00.2 pc .",

    "this possible cluster was not selected by any previous searches ( i.e. , dutra & bica 2001 ; mercer et al . 2005 ) , and so the system qualifies as a false - negative cluster with respect to those searches .",

    "their derived extinction values are significantly below those of the early - type stars , which implies that they lie in the foreground and are unrelated to the system .",

    "thus , the available data suggests that the late - type stars c , e , and h lie in the cluster foreground .    the distance of 6.1 kpc places the g37.51@xmath1470.46 cluster within the massive - star formation region near the intersection of the scutum - centaurus arm and galaxy s long bar (  ) , where we noted earlier the enhancement in the wr surface density and the presence of numerous massive stellar clusters .",

    ", we suspect that 2mass j1321223498@xmath147621456 has the highest likelihood of being a wr , since it is the brightest of the remaining candidates and closest to the main cluster center in figure [ fig : danks ] .",
    "the danks 1 and 2 clusters lie at an estimated distance of @xmath03.5 kpc , behind an extinction screen of @xmath157 mag ( bica et al .",

    "our derived distance of 6.9 kpc for the wc7 star mdm6 is particularly deviant , having nearly twice the accepted value for the clusters ; yet , it has an extinction value that is consistent with the value for the region .",
    "thus , either mdm6 lies at a distance significantly beyond the clusters and is not physically associated with them , or the adopted value of @xmath160 mag from crowther et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used for wc57 stars is unsuitably bright for this particular star .",
    "in fact , assuming that the infrared colors that we used are applicable , mdm6 is expected to have @xmath161 mag if it lies at the accepted cluster distance of 3.5 kpc ( clark & porter 2004 ) . the discrepancy can not be the result of unaccounted - for dust emission , since the additional reddening and @xmath25-band flux that are associated with hot dust emission would lead to an underestimation of distance , not an overestimation .",
    "the same would be true if there were a bright , unresolved companion contributing to the flux .",
    "thus , we are forced to consider the possibility that wc6 stars exhibit a broader range of @xmath80 values than we have anticipated .",
    "if we exclude mdm6 from the calculation of average distance to g305 , then we obtain a value of 2.9@xmath1620.8 kpc ( @xmath163% ) , which implies that our anticipated , average distance uncertainty of @xmath030% using the spectroscopic parallax method is a reasonable estimate .    including the wc6@xmath56ob binary wr48a , the results of our survey bring the total number of known wrs associated with the g305 h ii region to eight objects .",
    "clark & porter ( 2004 ) suggested that the danks 1 and 2 clusters have succeeded in clearing away the majority of their natal material , implying that significant photon leakage is taking place in tandem with the ionization of the surrounding three - lobed bubble .",
    "this suggestion , coupled with the integrated radio flux emanating from the region , led those authors to the conclusion that a large population of massive stars having a total lyman continuum ( lyc ) photon output greater than the equivalent of 31 o7v stars is likely to populate this environment , supplying at least @xmath164 lyc s@xmath59 .",
    "the new wrs presented here , in addition to massive stars presented in clark et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , certainly represent a significant fraction of the population presumed to exist by clark & porter ( 2004 ) .",
    "in fact , by adopting @xmath165 values of wr subtypes from figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we approximate that the eight wrs shown in figure [ fig : danks ] supply @xmath166 lyc photons s@xmath59 ( averaging over subtypes from wrs in figer et al . 1999 , we find that log@xmath167 , 49.7 , and 49.5 for wc67 , wc8 , and wn89 stars , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the ionizing flux of g305 inferred by clark & porter ( 2004 ) could now be fully accounted for .",
    "of course , owing to the natural photon leakage out of the g305 complex and the obvious presence of candidate supergiant stars that remain unidentified within the clusters , there is undoubtedly more lyc flux being generated in this region than we have currently estimated .",
    "it is interesting to find that five of the wrs associated with g305 are relatively well separated from the centers of the danks 1 and 2 clusters .",
    "mdm3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and wr48a , as a group , appear to be centered on danks 1 , and are separated from the cluster by @xmath020 , implying a physical separation of @xmath020 pc ( assuming the cluster distance of 3.5 kpc ) .",
    "the distribution of these stars is rather puzzling .",
    "as the most highly evolved massive stars in the g305 system , these wrs presumably have the most massive progenitors , whose orbits should have relaxed near the cluster center as a result of dynamical friction . however , within the dense cluster centers there is a relatively high probability of gravitational encounters between other massive stars and binaries , which leads to an increased probability of orbital  heating \" or cluster ejection .",
    "this could explain the extended distribution of mdm3 , mdm4 , mdm5 , mdm6 , and wr48a .",
    "we speculated earlier that such processes provide one potential explanation as to why so many of the new wrs presented in this work appear to be  isolated \" objects , possibly runaways from their birthplaces in clusters ( moffat & isserstedt 1980 ; moffat et al .",

    "thus , although we do not know the intrinsic color of mdm50 , it is probably reasonable to presume that its intrinsic excess is similar to the bluest wrs in our sample , which have @xmath181 mag and @xmath182 mag .",
    "if so , then applying the method of extinction calculation from section 6 yields @xmath183 mag , using both the @xmath27 and @xmath17 colors . assigning @xmath184 values ranging from o dwarfs ( @xmath185 mag ) to supergiants ( @xmath186 mag )",
    "we obtain possible distances of 3.3 kpc and 6.5 kpc , respectively . examining the distances of eight wrs in table [ tab : phot2 ] that have @xmath187 mag shows that they have an average distance of 2.7 kpc with a standard deviation of 0.8 kpc .",
    "therefore , the photometry is inconsistent with the supergiant luminosity class , since an extinction of @xmath188 mag would be anomalously low for a distance of 6.5 kpc .",
    "the @xmath189 mag is more appropriate , and is consistent with a mid - to - late ov star ( @xmath5 ) .    moving forward with the o - star hypothesis ,",
    "mdm50 is similar in @xmath18-band spectral morphology to the variable o6v : pe star hd 39680 ( note that the  pe \" qualifier is he i emission ) , which is dominated by he i emission at @xmath542.058 , while also exhibiting weak he ii at @xmath542.189 ( hanson et al .",
    "hd 39680 is a low - amplitude variable star , exhibiting small fluctuations of amplitude 0.13 mag ( ) .",
    "mdm50 is also photometrically variable .",
    "eight observations of calibration fields for the sloan digital sky survey spaced throughout 1 year revealed mdm50 to be a variable star exhibiting variations of @xmath00.10.2 mag at @xmath190 band ( henden & stone 1998 ) , similar to the variability amplitude of hd 39680 .",
    "it is , therefore , plausible that mdm50 is also an ov : pe star like hd 39680 .",
    "if so , the reason for selection of this star by our color criteria is unclear",
    ". it may be the result of excess emission from an ionized , free - free emitting circumstellar disk similar to those surrounding the be class ( negueruela et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is plausible that the low - ionization features of na i and mg ii that we detected in the mdm50 s spectrum are generated in such a disk , especially since we do not expect these features to arise from the same emission component as the high - excitation he ii lines . as there is currently no firm evidence for the existence of ionized disks around oe stars ( vink et al .",
    "2009 ) , the confirmation of such a structure around mdm50 would be particularly interesting",
    ".    we also noted in section 4 the spectral similarity between mdm50 and nast1 , the latter of which has been classified as wr cloaked in a massive @xmath191 car - like nebula ( crowther & smith 1999 ) .",
    "nast1 also exhibits relatively narrow , nebular emission lines , including he ii emission .",
    "however , the mid - infrared sed of nast1 exhibits a very large thermal excess from dust , while mdm50 exhibits a far weaker excess component , which is inconsistent with the presence of a massive dusty envelope .",
    "the spectrum of mdm50 shares some similarities with the spectra of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars in their hot state ( e.g. , see clark et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the absence of significant h i emission features in our infrared spectra is somewhat inconsistent with a lbv classification .",
    "still , given that mdm50 is a confirmed variable emission - line star , its connection to the lbv phenomenon is worthy of speculation , and we should not rule out this possibility . if it is a quiescent lbv , it would have to be one of the least luminous such stars known , having @xmath192 .    in conclusion , although we regard the oe classification for mdm50 as most appropriate , given the available data , the true nature of this star remains uncertain , and it deserves more detailed spectroscopic investigation and photometric monitoring .",
    "we have spectroscopically detected 60 new galactic wrs using the method of infrared color selection , and also by cross - correlation with x - ray point source catalogs .",
    "our wr detection rate of @xmath020% , using the broad - color zones defined in figure 1 , is a significant improvement over previous efforts , which had wr detection rates below 10% ( hadfield et al . 2007 ;",
    "mauerhan et al .",
    "the improvement is attributable to our refinement of the color selection criterion , including new color - magnitude restrictions , and the inclusion of x - ray emission , which is not a ubiquitous property of the be  contaminants \" also selected by our color method . including the",
    "be stars , it is remarkable that the broad color space returns early - type emission - line stars almost entirely , at a rate of @xmath095% . by selecting wr candidates from a smaller color space of the  wr sweet spot , \" which contains significantly fewer",
    "be stars , we experienced a detection rate of @xmath250% . for the x - ray emitting candidates , we detected 10 wr sources after observing 23 objects , implying a detection rate of @xmath040% .",
    "we presented their x - ray properties , which are consistent with known , solitary wrs , as well as those in some colliding - wind binaries .",
    "most of the new wrs appear  isolated \" in the field ; some could be runaways , others might have formed in relative isolation , or could be members of  false negative \" clusters that are difficult to distinguish against the dense stellar background of the galactic plane .",
    "we have discovered at least one such cluster , containing two wc8 stars and several ob supergiants .",
    "we also identified several wrs in the known stellar clusters danks 1 and 2 , [ dbs2003 ] 179 , and [ mfd2008 ] .",
    "the results imply that our method of selecting candidate wrs from the field could provide the most effective means of detecting wr - bearing false - negative clusters in the galaxy .",
    "the latest results bring the total number of known galactic wrs to 476 , which is @xmath078% of the total expected population of the galaxy , estimated to be as high as @xmath06000 - 6500 objects ( shara et al .",
    "the current wn / wc ratio of the galactic sample is @xmath01.5 .",
    "although wr subtype ratios are commonly referenced in tests of stellar evolutionary models ( e.g. , meynet & maeder 2005 ) , they can only have meaning for complete or subtype - unbiased samples of wrs .",
    "there may be reason to suspect a subtype bias in the current sample .",
    "for example , even though the earliest wne types ( wn34 ) have dense winds ( strong free - free excesses and broad he i and he ii lines ) , they are intrinsically the faintest of the wrs , by 12 mag ( crowther et al .",
    "2006 ) , we would expect surveys of the inner galaxy to have more difficulty recovering these objects relative to , say , wn79 stars .",
    "thus , the galactic longitudinal and radial distributions of wrs as a function of subtype , shown in figures 11b and 12 , are simply the observed distributions , and should not be misconstrued or over - interpreted . on the other hand , the observed surface density of all known wrs with respect to galactic longitude ( see figure 11a ) does appear to reflect true physical structures of the galaxy , including prominent massive - star formation sites , such as w43 and the westerlund 1 region , and portions of the sky where major spiral arms run approximately parallel to our line of sight , e.g. , the scutum - centaurus and sagittarius arms in the range @xmath137@xmath193 .",
    "there are @xmath04900 unobserved wr candidates remaining in our sample from the glimpse - i survey area ( @xmath19@xmath194 , @xmath195@xmath21 ; @xmath196 ) . if the overall broad - color detection rate of @xmath020% persists , than we expect that almost 1000 wrs could potentially be detected in future confirmation observations .",
    "however , the observations that we have conducted thus far have given priority to bright sources over fainter ones .",
    "@xmath25-band magnitudes are typically in the range of 811 for our sample , while average extinction values are @xmath02 mag .",
    "thus , assuming a generic absolute @xmath25 magnitude of @xmath197 for wrs implies that we are mainly sensitive to wrs lying at distances of @xmath308 kpc from the sun , on our side of the galaxy . expanding the survey volume to include wrs",
    "all the way to the solar circle on the far side of the galaxy would require sampling candidates having @xmath198 mag .",
    "however , we presume that as these fainter candidates are targeted , the associated degradation in both their 2mass and glimpse photometric qualities and the increase in stellar confusion will result in a significantly decreased wr confirmation rate . a decline in photometric quality",
    "is also expected for the inner glimpse - ii survey area ( @xmath199 from the galactic center ) , owing to the relatively high source confusion in the innermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "there are @xmath01700 candidates in this area , although the wr detection rate has not yet been determined here , since the earliest color - based surveys by hadfield et al .",
    "( 2007 ) failed to detect any wrs in the glimpse - ii fields .",
    "continued surveys in this region are thus necessary in order to estimate the number of wrs that are contained within the glimpse - ii point - source catalog and the extent of the galactic volume that our survey is sensitive to .",
    "the color - based search for galactic wrs is currently the most efficient method for identifying these objects in the galaxy .",
    "although the observational prescription described in this work has resulted in the greatest wr confirmation rate produced thus far , the infrared phenomenology behind the color selection method deserves further study , in order to establish an improved understanding of the wr subtype selection biases inherent in this technique .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and the nsf .",
    "the research was based on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space observatory _ , the hale 5 m telescope at palomar observatory , cerro tololo international observatory , and the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",

    "<S> the new wrs were selected via a method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors , which is mainly the result of excess radiation generated by free - free scattering within their dense ionized winds . the selection criterion has been refined since the last report , resulting in a wr detection rate of @xmath020% in spectroscopic follow - up of candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution of all known wrs having @xmath1 mag . however , there are smaller regions within this color space which yield wrs at a rate of @xmath250% in spectroscopic follow - up . </S>",
    "<S> candidates which are not wrs are mainly be stars , which is possibly attributable to the physical similarities between the free - free emission parameters of be disks and wr winds . as an additional selection experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the list of wr candidates was cross - correlated with archival x - ray point - source catalogs , which increases the wr detection rate of the broad color space to @xmath040% ; ten new wr x - ray sources have been found , in addition to a previously unrecognized x - ray counterpart to a known wr . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction values , distances , and galactocentric radii of all new wrs are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax . </S>",
    "<S> although the majority of the new wrs have no obvious association with stellar clusters , two wc8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive - star cluster , in which five ob supergiants were also identified . </S>",
    "<S> the new system lies at an estimated distance of @xmath3 kpc , near the intersection of the scutum - centaurus arm with the galaxy s bar . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two wc and four wn stars , all but one of which are x - ray sources , were identified in association with the stellar clusters danks 1 and 2 . a wn9 star has also been associated with the cluster [ dbs2003 ] 179 . </S>",
    "<S> this work brings the total number of known galactic wrs to 476 , or @xmath07%8% of the total empirically estimated population . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of their galactic distribution reveals an approximate tracing of spiral arms and an enhanced wr surface density toward several massive - star formation sites . </S>"
