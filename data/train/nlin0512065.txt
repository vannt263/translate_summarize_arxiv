    "solutions to integrable differential equations in terms of theta - functions were introduced with the works of novikov , dubrovin , matveev , its , krichever ,  ( see  @xcite ) for the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "such solutions to e.g.  the kdv , the sine - gordon , and the non - linear schrdinger equation describe periodic or quasi - periodic solutions , see  @xcite .",
    "they are given explicitly in terms of riemann theta - functions defined on some riemann surface .",
    "though all quantities entering the solution are in general given in explicit form via integrals on the riemann surface , the work with theta - functional solutions admittedly has not reached the importance of soliton solutions .",
    "the main reason for the more widespread use of solitons is that they are given in terms of algebraic or exponential functions . on the other hand",
    "the parameterization of theta - functions by the underlying riemann surface is very implicit .",
    "the main parameters , typically the branch points of the riemann surface , enter the solutions as parameters in integrals on the riemann surface .",
    "a full understanding of the functional dependence on these parameters seems to be only possible numerically . in recent years",
    "algorithms have been developed to establish such relations for rather general riemann surfaces as in  @xcite or via schottky uniformization ( see @xcite ) , which have been incorporated successively in numerical and symbolic codes , see  @xcite and references therein ( the last two references are distributed along with maple  6 , respectively maple  8 , and as a java implementation at @xcite ) . for an approach to express periods of hyperelliptic riemann surfaces via theta constants see @xcite .",
    "these codes are convenient to study theta - functional solutions of equations of kdv - type where the considered riemann surfaces are ` static ' , i.e. , independent of the physical coordinates . in these cases",
    "the characteristic quantities of the riemann surface have to be calculated once , just the comparatively fast summation in the approximation of the theta series via a finite sum as e.g.in  @xcite has to be carried out in dependence of the space - time coordinates .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study numerically theta - functional solutions of the ernst equation  @xcite which were given by korotkin  @xcite . in this case",
    "the branch points of the underlying hyperelliptic riemann surface are parameterized by the physical coordinates , the spectral curve of the ernst equation is in this sense ` dynamical ' .",
    "the solutions are thus not studied on a single riemann surface but on a whole family of surfaces .",
    "this implies that the time - consuming calculation of the periods of the riemann surface has to be carried out for each point in the space - time .",
    "this includes limiting cases where the surface is almost degenerate .",
    "in addition the theta - functional solutions should be calculated to high precision in order to be able to test numerical solutions for rapidly rotating neutron stars such as provided e.g. by the spectral code ` lorene `  @xcite .",
    "this requires a very efficient code of high precision .",
    "we present here a numerical code for hyperelliptic surfaces where the integrals entering the solution are calculated by expanding the integrands with a fast cosine transformation in matlab .",
    "the precision of the numerical evaluation is tested by checking identities for periods on riemann surfaces and by comparison with exact solutions .",
    "the code is in principle able to deal with general ( non - singular ) hyperelliptic surfaces , but is optimized for a genus  2 solution to the ernst equation which was constructed in  @xcite .",
    "we show that an accuracy of the order of machine precision ( @xmath0 ) can be achieved at a space - time point in general position with 32 polynomials and in the case of almost degenerate surfaces which occurs e.g. , when the point approaches the symmetry axis with at most 256 polynomials .",
    "global tests of the numerical accuracy of the solutions to the ernst equation are provided by integral identities for the ernst potential and its derivatives : the equality of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass and the komar mass ( see  @xcite ) and a generalization of the newtonian virial theorem as derived in  @xcite .",
    "we use the so determined numerical data for the theta - functions to provide ` exact ' boundary values on a sphere for the program library ` lorene `  @xcite which was developed for a numerical treatment of rapidly rotating neutron stars . `",
    "lorene ` solves the boundary value problem for the stationary axisymmetric einstein equations with spectral methods .",
    "we show that the theta - functional solution is reproduced to the order of @xmath1 and better .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : ernsteq ] we collect useful facts on the ernst equation and hyperelliptic riemann surfaces , in section  [ sec : spectral ] we summarize basic features of spectral methods and explain our implementation of various quantities .",
    "the calculation of the periods of the hyperelliptic surface and the non - abelian line integrals entering the solution is performed together with tests of the precision of the numerics . in section  [ sec : integrals ] we check integral identities for the ernst potential .",
    "the test of the spectral code ` lorene ` is presented in section  [ sec : lorene ] . in section  [ sec : concl ] we add some concluding remarks .",
    "the ernst equation for the complex valued potential @xmath2 ( we denote the real and the imaginary part of @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) depending on the two coordinates @xmath5 can be written in the form @xmath6 the equation has a physical interpretation as the stationary axisymmetric einstein equations in vacuum ( see appendix and references given therein ) .",
    "its complete integrability was shown by maison  @xcite and belinski - zakharov  @xcite . for real ernst potential",
    ", the ernst equation reduces to the axisymmetric laplace equation for @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding solutions are static and belong to the so called weyl class , see  @xcite .",
    "algebro - geometric solutions to the ernst equation were given by korotkin  @xcite .",
    "the solutions are defined on a family of hyperelliptic surfaces @xmath8 with @xmath9 corresponding to the plane algebraic curve @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the genus of the surface and where the branch points @xmath12 , @xmath13 are independent of the physical coordinates and for each @xmath14 subject to the reality condition @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "hyperelliptic riemann surfaces are important since they show up in the context of algebro - geometric solutions of various integrable equations as kdv , sine - gordon and ernst . whereas it is a non - trivial problem to find a basis for the holomorphic differentials on general surfaces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , it is given in the hyperelliptic case ( see e.g.  @xcite ) by @xmath17 which is the main simplification in the use of these surfaces .",
    "we introduce on @xmath18 a canonical basis of cycles @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the holomorphic differentials @xmath21 are normalized by the condition on the @xmath22-periods @xmath23 the matrix of @xmath4-periods is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is a so - called riemann matrix , i.e.  it is symmetric and has a negative definite real part .",
    "the abel map @xmath26 with base point @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29is the jacobian of @xmath18 .",
    "the theta - function with characteristics corresponding to the curve @xmath18 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the argument and @xmath32 are the characteristics .",
    "we will only consider half - integer characteristics in the following .",
    "the theta - function with characteristics is , up to an exponential factor , equivalent to the theta - function with zero characteristic ( the riemann theta - function is denoted with @xmath33 ) and shifted argument ,",
    "@xmath34    we denote by @xmath35 a differential of the third kind , i.e. , a 1-form which has poles in @xmath36 with respective .",
    "residues @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this singularity structure characterizes the differentials only up to an arbitrary linear combination of holomorphic differentials .",
    "the meromorphic differentials can be normalized by the condition that all @xmath22-periods vanish .",
    "we use the notation @xmath39 for the infinite points on different sheets of the curve @xmath18 , namely @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "the differential @xmath42 is given up to holomorphic differentials by @xmath43 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath4-periods of normalized differentials of the third kind can be expressed in terms of the abel map ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath44    in  @xcite a physically interesting subclass of korotkin s solution was identified which can be written in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and where @xmath47 @xmath48 is a piece - wise smooth contour on @xmath18 and @xmath49 is a non - zero hlder - continuous function on @xmath48 .",
    "the contour @xmath48 and the function @xmath50 have to satisfy the reality conditions that with @xmath51 also @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; both are independent of the physical coordinates .    in the following",
    "we will discuss the example of the solution constructed in  @xcite which can be interpreted as a disk of collisionless matter .",
    "for a physical interpretation see  @xcite .",
    "the solution is given on a surface of the form  ( [ hyper1 ] ) with genus 2 .",
    "the branch points independent of the physical coordinates are related through the relations @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the branch points are parameterized by two real parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 . writing @xmath59 with real @xmath60 , @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 the contour @xmath48 is the piece of the covering of the imaginary axis in the upper sheet between @xmath63 $ ] , the function @xmath50 has the form @xmath64 the physical parameters vary between @xmath65 , the solution which was first given in  @xcite , and @xmath66 , the static limit in which @xmath67 . in the latter case the riemann surface degenerates , the resulting ernst potential ( [ ernst2 ] ) is real and be expressed in terms of objects corresponding to the surface @xmath68 of genus 0 defined by the relation @xmath69 . the parameter @xmath57 varies between @xmath70 , the so - called newtonian limit where the branch points @xmath12 , @xmath13 tend to infinity . since @xmath50 is also of order @xmath57 in this limit , the lowest order contributions are again real and defined on the surface @xmath68 .",
    "this case corresponds to the disk limit of the maclaurin ellipsoids , see  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath57 is infinity for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath65 .",
    "the limiting situation is special in the second case since the resulting spacetime is no longer asymptotically flat and since the axis is singular .",
    "the invariant circumference of the disk is zero in this case which implies that the disk shrinks to a point for an observer in the exterior of the disk , see @xcite .    for physical reasons",
    "the solution was discussed in  @xcite in dependence of two other real parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath73 is related to the redshift of photons emitted at the center of the disk and detected at infinity .",
    "it varies between 0 in the newtonian limit , and 1 in the ultra - relativistic limit , where photons can not escape to infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath73 is a measure of how relativistic the situation is .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 is a measure of how static the solution is , it varies between 0 , indicating the static limit and 1 .",
    "for the functional relations between @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 see  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath75 ( with respect to the physical coordinates ) to appear in the following can be considered as a natural scale for the angular velocities in the disk , for a definition see  @xcite .",
    "the coordinate @xmath76 can take all non - negative real values , the coordinate @xmath77 all real values .",
    "the example we are studying here has an equatorial symmetry , @xmath78 it is therefore sufficient to consider only non - negative values of @xmath77 .",
    "the case @xmath79 corresponds to the axis of symmetry where the branch cut @xmath80 $ ] degenerates to a point .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite , the ernst potential can be written in this limit in terms of theta - functions on the elliptic surface @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 , i.e.  the surface @xmath18 with the cut @xmath80 $ ] removed .",
    "near the axis the ernst potential has the form ( see  @xcite ) @xmath83 here @xmath84 and @xmath85 are independent of @xmath76 , @xmath84 is the axis potential .",
    "this formula could be used to calculate the potential close to the axis .",
    "however we considered only values of @xmath76 greater than @xmath86 and did not experience any numerical problems .",
    "consequently we did not use formula  ( [ eq : nearaxis ] ) .    for large values of @xmath87 ,",
    "the ernst potential has the asymptotic expansion @xmath88 here the constants ( with respect to @xmath89 ) @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the adm - mass and , respectively , the angular momentum of the space - time .",
    "they can be calculated on the axis in terms of elliptic theta - functions , see  @xcite .",
    "formula  ( [ eq : ernstinfinity ] ) is used for values of @xmath92 .    in the limit @xmath93",
    ", the ernst potential can be given on the surface @xmath94 of genus  0 obtained by removing the cuts @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath95 $ ] from the surface @xmath18 .",
    "the potential can thus be given in this case in terms of elementary functions , see  @xcite .",
    "in the equatorial plane @xmath96 , the riemann surface @xmath18 has an additional involution @xmath97 as can be seen from  ( [ hyper1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the surface can be considered as a covering of an elliptic surface , see  @xcite .",
    "the theta - functions in  ( [ ernst2 ] ) can be written as sums of theta - functions on the covered surface and on the prym variety which happens to be an elliptic surface as well in this case .",
    "we use this fact at the disk ( @xmath96 , @xmath98 ) , where the moving branch points are situated on @xmath48 .",
    "there all quantities can be expressed in terms of quantities defined on the prym surface @xmath99 defined by @xmath100 , see  @xcite .",
    "the numerical task in this work is to approximate and evaluate analytically defined functions as accurately and efficiently as possible . to this end",
    "it is advantageous to use ( pseudo-)spectral methods which are distinguished by their excellent approximation properties when applied to smooth functions . here",
    "the functions are known to be analytic except for isolated points . in this section",
    "we explain the basic ideas behind the use of spectral methods and describe in detail how the theta - functions and the ernst potential can be obtained to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the basic idea of spectral methods is to approximate a given function @xmath3 globally on its domain of definition by a linear combination @xmath101 where the function @xmath102 are taken from some class of functions which is chosen appropriately for the problem at hand .    the coefficients @xmath103 are determined by requiring that the linear combination should be ` close ' to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , one could require that @xmath104 should be minimal for some norm .",
    "another possibility is to require that @xmath105 for @xmath106 with an appropriate inner product and associated orthonormal basis @xmath107 .",
    "this is called the galerkin method .",
    "finally , one can demand that @xmath108 at selected points @xmath109 .",
    "this is the so called collocation method which is the one we will use in this paper . in this case",
    "the function values @xmath110 and the coefficients @xmath103 are related by the matrix @xmath111 .",
    "the choice of the expansion basis depends to a large extent on the specific problem . for periodic functions",
    "there is the obvious choice of trigonometric polynomials @xmath112 while for functions defined on a finite interval the most used functions are orthogonal polynomials , in particular chebyshev and legendre polynomials .",
    "while the latter are important because of their relationship with the spherical harmonics on the sphere , the former are used because they have very good approximation properties and because one can use fast transform methods when computing the expansion coefficients from the function values provided one chooses the collocation points @xmath113 ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we will use here collocation with chebyshev polynomials .",
    "let us briefly summarize here their basic properties .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials @xmath114 are defined on the interval @xmath115 $ ] by the relation @xmath116.\\ ] ] they satisfy the differential equation @xmath117 the addition theorems for sine and cosine imply the recursion relations @xmath118 for the polynomials @xmath119 and @xmath120 for their derivatives .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal on @xmath121 with respect to the hermitian inner product @xmath122 we have @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 otherwise .",
    "now suppose that a function @xmath3 on @xmath121 is sampled at the points @xmath113 and that @xmath126 is the interpolating polynomial .",
    "defining @xmath127 , @xmath128 for @xmath129 in the discrete case and the numbers @xmath130 we have @xmath131 this looks very much like a discrete cosine series and in fact one can show  @xcite that the coefficients @xmath132 are related to the values @xmath133 of the function by an inverse discrete fourier transform ( dct ) @xmath134 note , that up to a numerical factor the dct is idempotent , i.e. , it is its own inverse .",
    "this relationship between the chebyshev polynomials and the dct is the basis for the efficient computations because the dct can be performed numerically by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) and pre- and postprocessing of the coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the fast transform allows us to switch easily between the representations of the function in terms of its sampled values and in terms of the expansion coefficients @xmath135 ( or @xmath132 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is approximated globally by a finite sum of polynomials allows us to express any operation applied to @xmath3 approximately in terms of the coefficients .",
    "let us illustrate this in the case of integration .",
    "so we assume that @xmath136 and we want to find an approximation of the integral for @xmath137 , i.e. , the function @xmath138 so that @xmath139 .",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath140 and obtain the equation @xmath141 expressing @xmath119 in terms of the @xmath142 using   and comparing coefficients implies the equations @xmath143 between the coefficients which determines all @xmath144 in terms of the @xmath135 except for @xmath145 .",
    "this free constant is determined by the requirement that @xmath146 which implies ( because @xmath147 ) @xmath148 these coefficients @xmath149 determine a polynomial @xmath150 of degree @xmath151 which approximates the indefinite integral @xmath152 of the @xmath151-th degree polynomial @xmath3 .",
    "the exact function is a polynomial of degree @xmath153 whose highest coefficient is proportional to the highest coefficient @xmath154 of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , ignoring this term we make an error whose magnitude is of the order of @xmath155 so that the approximation will be the better the smaller @xmath155 is . the same is true when a smooth function @xmath3 is approximated by a polynomial  @xmath137 .",
    "then , again , the indefinite integral will be approximated well by the polynomial @xmath150 whose coefficients are determined as above provided the highest coefficients in the approximating polynomial @xmath137 are small .    from the coefficients @xmath149 we can also find an approximation to the definite integral @xmath156 by evaluating @xmath157 thus , to find an approximation of the integral of a function @xmath3 we proceed as described above , first computing the coefficients @xmath135 of @xmath3 , computing the @xmath149 and then calculating the sum of the odd coefficients .      the riemann surface @xmath18 is defined by an algebraic curve of the form @xmath158 where in our case we have @xmath159 throughout . in order to compute the periods and the theta - functions",
    "related to this riemann surface it is necessary to evaluate the square - root @xmath160 for arbitrary complex numbers @xmath161 . in order to make this a well defined problem",
    "we introduce the cut - system as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut - system ] .    on the cut surface",
    "the square - root @xmath162 is defined as in  @xcite as the product of square - roots of monomials @xmath163 the square - root routines such as the one available in matlab usually have their branch - cut along the negative real axis .",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : root ] ) is holomorphic on the cut surface so that we can not simply take the builtin square - root when computing @xmath160 .",
    "instead we need to use the information provided by the cut - system to define adapted square - roots .",
    "let @xmath164 be the argument of a complex number @xmath165 with values in @xmath166-\\pi,\\pi[$ ] and consider two factors in  ( [ eq : root ] ) such as @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are two branch - points connected by a branch - cut .",
    "let @xmath170 be the argument at the line from @xmath168 to @xmath169 .",
    "now we define the square - root @xmath171{\\cdot}$ ] with branch - cut along the ray with argument @xmath60 by computing for each @xmath172 the square - root @xmath173 with the available matlab routine and then putting @xmath174{z } = \\left\\ {    \\begin{array}{rl }       s & \\alpha/2<\\arg(s)<\\alpha/2 + \\pi\\\\       -s & \\text{otherwise }    \\end{array } \\right . .\\ ] ] with this square - root we compute the two factors @xmath174{k - p_1}\\sqrt[(\\alpha)]{k - p_2}.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that this expression changes sign exactly when the branch - cut between @xmath168 and @xmath169 is crossed .",
    "we compute the expression  ( [ eq : root ] ) by multiplying the pairs of factors which correspond to the branch - cuts .",
    "this procedure is not possible in the case of the non - linear transformations we are using to evaluate the periods in certain limiting cases . in these cases",
    "the root is chosen in a way that the integrand is a continuous function on the path of integration .",
    "the quantities entering formula  ( [ ernst2 ] ) for the ernst potential are the periods of the riemann surface and the line integrals @xmath175 and @xmath121 .",
    "the value of the theta - function is then approximated by a finite sum .",
    "the periods of a hyperelliptic riemann surface can be expressed as integrals between branch points .",
    "since we need in our example the periods of the holomorphic differentials and the differential of the third kind with poles at @xmath39 , we have to consider integrals of the form @xmath176 where the @xmath177 , @xmath178 denote the branch points of @xmath18 .",
    "in general position we use a linear transformation of the form @xmath179 to transform the integral  ( [ period1 ] ) to the normal form @xmath180 where the @xmath181 are complex constants and where @xmath182 is a continuous ( in fact , analytic ) complex valued function on the interval @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "this form of the integral suggests to express the powers @xmath184 in the numerator in terms of the first three chebyshev polynomials @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 and to approximate the function @xmath182 by a linear combination of chebyshev polynomials @xmath188 the integral is then calculated with the help of the orthogonality relation  ( [ eq : ortho ] ) of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "since the ernst potential has to be calculated for all @xmath189 , it is convenient to use the cut - system  ( [ fig : cut - system ] ) . in this system",
    "the moving cut does not cross the immovable cut .",
    "in addition the system is adapted to the symmetries and reality properties of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the periods @xmath190 and @xmath191 are related to @xmath192 and @xmath193 via complex conjugation . for the analytical calculations of the ernst potential in the limit of collapsing cuts , we have chosen in  @xcite cut systems adapted to the respective situation . in the limit @xmath194 we were using for instance a system where @xmath190 is the cycle around the cut",
    "@xmath80 $ ] .",
    "this has the effect that only the @xmath4-period @xmath191 diverges logarithmically in this case whereas the remaining periods stay finite as @xmath76 tends to 0 . in the cut systems [ fig : cut - system ] ,",
    "all periods diverge as @xmath195 .",
    "since the divergence is only logarithmical this does not pose a problem for values of @xmath196 .",
    "in addition the integrals which have to be calculated in the evaluation of the periods are the same in both cut - system .",
    "thus there is no advantage in using different cut systems for the numerical work .    to test the numerics we use the fact that the integral of any holomorphic differential along a contour surrounding the cut @xmath197 $ ] in positive direction is equal to minus the sum of all @xmath22-periods of this integral .",
    "since this condition is not implemented in the code it provides a strong test for the numerics .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_periods ] that 16 to 32 polynomials are sufficient in general position to achieve optimal accuracy .",
    "since matlab works with 16 digits , machine precision is in general limited to 14 digits due to rounding errors .",
    "these rounding errors are also the reason why the accuracy drops slightly when a higher number of polynomials is used .",
    "the use of a low number of polynomials consequently does not only require less computational resources but has the additional benefit of reducing the rounding errors .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to reformulate a problem if a high number of polynomials would be necessary to obtain optimal accuracy .",
    "these situations occur in the calculation of the periods when the moving branch points almost coincide which happens on the axis of symmetry in the space - time or at spatial infinity . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : test_periods ] , for @xmath198 and @xmath199 not even 2048 polynomials ( this is the limit due to memory on the low end computers we were using ) produce sufficient accuracy .",
    "the reason for these problems is that the function @xmath200 in  ( [ eq : int_aperiod ] ) behaves like @xmath201 near @xmath202 . for small @xmath76",
    "this behavior is only satisfactorily approximated by a large number of polynomials .",
    "we therefore split the integral in two integrals between @xmath203 and @xmath204 and between @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the first integral is calculated with the chebyshev integration routine after the substitution @xmath206 .",
    "this substitution leads to a regular integrand also at the branch point @xmath203 .",
    "the second integral is calculated with the chebyshev integration routine after the substitution @xmath207 .",
    "this takes care of the almost collapsing cut @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_periods ] that 128 polynomials are sufficient to obtain machine precision even in almost degenerate situations .",
    "the cut - system in fig .  [ fig : cut - system ] is adapted to the limit @xmath208 in what concerns the @xmath22-periods , since the cut which collapses in this limit is encircled by an @xmath22-cycle .",
    "however there will be similar problems as above in the determination of the @xmath4-periods .",
    "for @xmath209 we split the integrals for the @xmath4-periods as above in two integrals between @xmath210 and @xmath211 , and @xmath211 and @xmath203 . for the first integral we use the integration variable @xmath212 , for the second @xmath213 .",
    "since the riemann matrix ( the matrix of @xmath4-periods of the holomorphic differentials after normalization ) is symmetric , the error in the numerical evaluation of the @xmath4-periods can be estimated via the asymmetry of the calculated riemann matrix .",
    "we define the function @xmath214 as the maximum of the norm of the difference in the @xmath22-periods discussed above and the difference of the off - diagonal elements of the riemann matrix .",
    "this error is presented for a whole space - time in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] .",
    "the values for @xmath76 and @xmath77 vary between @xmath215 and @xmath216 . on the axis and at the disk",
    "we give the error for the elliptic integrals ( only the error in the evaluation of the @xmath22-periods , since the riemann matrix has just one component ) . for @xmath217",
    "the asymptotic formulas for the ernst potential are used .",

    "[ fig : virialtest ] .",
    "the drop in accuracy for strongly relativistic almost static situations ( @xmath74 small and @xmath73 close to 1 ) is again due to the almost degenerate riemann surface . the lower accuracy in the case of strongly relativistic situations for @xmath290 reflects the fact that the disk is shrinking to a point in this limit .",
    "to maintain the needed resolution one would have to use more polynomials in the evaluation of the virial - type identity which was not possible on the used computers .",

    "it turns out that one can always start the iteration with minkowski data , but it is necessary to use a relaxation : instead of the solution @xmath298 of  ( [ eq : poisson2 ] ) , it is better to take a combination @xmath299 with @xmath3000,1[$ ] ( typically @xmath301 ) as a new value in the source @xmath302 to provide numerical stability .",
    "the iteration is in general stopped if @xmath303 .",
    "the ernst equation  ( [ ernst1 ] ) is already in the form  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) , but it has the disadvantage that the equation is no longer strongly elliptic at the ergo - sphere where @xmath304 . in physical terms , this apparent singularity is just a coordinate singularity , and the theta - functional solutions are analytic there . the ernst equation in the form  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) has a right - hand side of the form ` @xmath305 ' for @xmath306 which causes numerical problems especially in the iteration process since the zeros of the numerator and the denominator will only coincide for the exact solution .",
    "the disk solutions we are studying here have ergo - spheres in the shape of cusped toroids ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is difficult to take care of the limit @xmath305 by using adapted coordinates .",
    "consequently the use of the ernst picture is restricted to weakly relativistic situations without ergo - spheres in this framework .    to be able to treat strongly relativistic situations",
    ", we use a different form of the stationary axisymmetric vacuum einstein equations which is derived from the standard @xmath307-decomposition , see  @xcite .",

    "thus the system of equations  ( [ eq : nu ] ) and  ( [ eq : v ] ) is strongly elliptic , even at an ergo - sphere .",
    "the disadvantage of this regular system is the non - linear dependence of the potentials @xmath308 and @xmath309 on the ernst potential and @xmath22 via ( [ eq : nun ] ) .",
    "thus we loose accuracy due to rounding errors of roughly an order of magnitude . though we have shown in the previous sections that we can guarantee the numerical accuracy of the data for @xmath3 and @xmath318 to the order of @xmath241 , the values for @xmath308 and @xmath315 are only reliable to the order of @xmath219 .    to test the spectral methods implemented in ` lorene ` , we provide boundary data for the disk solutions discussed above on a sphere around the disk .",
    "for these solutions it would have been more appropriate to prescribe data at the disk , but ` lorene ` was developed to treat objects of spherical topology such as stars which suggests the use of spherical coordinates .",
    "it would be possible to include coordinates like the disk coordinates of the previous section in ` lorene ` , but this is beyond the scope of this article .",

    "we choose the radius @xmath319 and the number of harmonics in a way that the fourier coefficients in @xmath277 drop below @xmath241 to make sure that the provided boundary data contain the related information to the order of machine precision .",
