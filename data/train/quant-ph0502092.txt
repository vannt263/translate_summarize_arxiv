    "in quantum mechanics , one can not predict the values of two or more spin components of a spin-1/2 particle with certainty , since the spin operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are not commutable .",
    "however , one can ask whether it is possible to retrodict the results of a spin measurement along more than one possible axis .",
    "this question , also known as the mean king s problem , was raised and solved by vaidman , aharonov , and albert @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the problem is formulated as follows .",
    "alice prepares a spin-1/2 particle in an initial state and gives it to bob .",
    "he measures a spin component of the particle along one of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 directions and gives the particle back to alice . without knowledge of bob s measurement direction and outcome , alice performs some measurement on the particle .",
    "then bob informs alice of his measurement direction .",
    "alice s task is now to retrodict the value of spin component along bob s measurement direction .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that alice can retrodict the values of spin component with certainty by utilizing the maximally entangled state of two spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the quantum - optical version of this scheme was also experimentally realized with an average success probability of 95.6% @xcite .    in the king s problem of a spin-1/2 particle",
    ", bob chooses one of the three bases , each of which consists of the two eigenstates of @xmath10 .",
    "a natural extension to higher dimensions , denoted by @xmath0 , involves @xmath1 mutually unbiased bases ( mub s ) for bob s possible measurement bases . here , two orthonormal bases @xmath11 and @xmath12 are said to be mutually unbiased if @xmath13 for all @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for the king s problem with non - mub s in @xmath16 dimension ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the maximal number of mub s in @xmath0 dimension is at most @xmath1 .",
    "it is known that if @xmath0 is a prime or a power of a prime , there exists the maximal number @xmath1 of mub s @xcite , but this is not known for any other composite numbers . a maximal set of mub s plays an important role in quantum tomography with wigner functions in finite dimensions @xcite .",
    "the king s problem with mub s has been successfully generalized to higher dimensions : @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and @xmath19 @xcite . in these generalizations",
    ", it was shown that alice can retrodict the result of bob s measurement in mub s if alice initially prepares a @xmath0 level quantum system as a subsystem of a maximally entangled composite system and in the end she performs a projection measurement in an appropriate basis on the composite system .",
    "a natural question is then whether the king s problem with mub s can always be solved in the same way provided that the maximal number of mub s exists . in this paper",
    ", we will study this problem and show that the existence of a solution of the king s problem with mub s is equivalent to that of the maximal number of mutually orthogonal latin squares . a possible relation between mub s and orthogonal latin squares",
    "was conjectured by wootters @xcite .",
    "combined with known results on orthogonal latin squares , our result first gives an alternative proof of the existence of solutions of the king s problem in prime power dimensions , and secondly it also implies that there is no solution in @xmath2 and @xmath3 dimensions even if the maximal set of mub s can be constructed in these dimensions .",
    "the problem we will consider is the following . in a @xmath0-dimensional complex vector space @xmath20 , we consider @xmath1 orthonormal bases labeled by @xmath21 . by @xmath22 , we denote a state vector in base @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the bases are mutually unbiased : @xmath24 alice and bob share a maximally entangled state on @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a reference orthonormal base in @xmath20 . in terms of base @xmath23 , the maximally",
    "entangled state @xmath28 is written as @xmath29 where an overlined state @xmath30 for a state @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 by the use of the reference base .",
    "bob randomly chooses base @xmath33 and measures his local system , the second component of the tensor product , and obtains the outcome @xmath34 .",
    "the post - measurement state is then given by @xmath35 here we note that the inner product of @xmath36 s is calculated as @xmath37 where the right - hand side is given in eq.([mub_condition ] ) . without knowing bob s measurement base @xmath23 and outcome @xmath38",
    ", alice performs a projective measurement on the composite system in the base @xmath39 of @xmath25 . after the measurement",
    ", alice is informed of bob s measurement base @xmath23 .",
    "alice s task is now to estimate bob s outcome @xmath38 from her measurement outcome @xmath40 and bob s base @xmath23 .",
    "let us write alice s estimate for bob s outcome as @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that alice s success probability is 1 if and only if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath42 in the following , we will study the above conditions in detail .",
    "first we show that the set @xmath43 consisting of @xmath44 states @xmath45 is complete in the composite space @xmath25 .",
    "suppose a linear relation with some coefficients @xmath46 holds , @xmath47 multiplying bra vector @xmath48 from the left and using the relation ( [ inner_product ] ) , we immediately find @xmath49 which implies that the coefficient @xmath46 should be independent of @xmath38 .",
    "now consider the subset @xmath50 which consists of @xmath51 states obtained by removing @xmath0 states @xmath52 from @xmath43 .",
    "assume a linear relation of type eq.([linear_relation ] ) for the states in @xmath50 .",
    "we find that @xmath53 for @xmath54 and any @xmath38 , since @xmath55 for @xmath54 by assumption .",
    "the linear relation is then reduced to @xmath56 implying @xmath57 .",
    "thus the @xmath51 states in @xmath50 are linearly independent and the set @xmath43 is complete in the @xmath51-dimensional composite space @xmath25 .",
    "next we consider another subset @xmath58 obtained by removing @xmath1 states @xmath59 from @xmath43 for a given @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath60 states in @xmath58 are linearly independent and span a @xmath60 subspace of @xmath25 , since a linear relation of type eq.([linear_relation ] ) with @xmath61 requires that all coefficients @xmath46 s be zero .",
    "now we go back to the conditions ( [ p1_condition ] ) for alice s measurement base @xmath39 and estimate @xmath62 .",
    "the conditions ( [ p1_condition ] ) require that each state @xmath63 should be orthogonal to the @xmath60 dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath58 and can be uniquely determined up to an irrelevant phase factor .",
    "we find that state @xmath63 satisfying conditions ( [ p1_condition ] ) is given by @xmath64 it is readily verified that the state @xmath63 satisfies the conditions ( [ p1_condition ] ) as @xmath65 and @xmath63 is normalized as @xmath66 .",
    "it remains to determine the condition for alice s estimate @xmath62 under which @xmath39 is an orthonormal base in @xmath25 .",
    "namely , @xmath51 states defined in eq.([i_definition ] ) should be orthogonal to each other .",
    "the inner product @xmath67 can be easily calculated and we find the orthogonality holds if and only if @xmath68 this is a necessary and sufficient condition for alice s success probability to be equal to 1 .",
    "we can interpret the conditions ( [ s_condition ] ) in terms of a set of character strings which satisfies a certain relation .",
    "consider a character string @xmath69 of length @xmath1 with each character chosen from the set @xmath70 : @xmath71 in this paper , two strings @xmath69 and @xmath72 of this type are said to be `` mutually unbiased '' if they share a common character at exactly one common place , @xmath73    with this definition , the necessary and sufficient condition ( [ s_condition ] ) is equivalent to the existence of @xmath51 mutually unbiased strings of length @xmath1 of @xmath0 kinds of characters . in fig.1",
    "we give an example of a set of nine mutually unbiased strings of length 4 in the case of @xmath17 .",
    "the question is for what @xmath0 the set of unbiased strings of this kind can be accommodated . before answering this question , however , we will study another form of the necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath62 .    as mentioned before , @xmath51 normalized states @xmath63 s defined by eq.([i_definition ] ) should form an orthonormal base . from the orthogonality",
    ", we obtained the condition ( [ s_condition ] ) . here",
    "we study the condition derived from the completeness @xmath74 , which is equivalent to the orthogonality .",
    "since the set of states @xmath45 is complete , the completeness of @xmath39 can be expressed as @xmath75 using eq.([i_condition ] ) for the left - hand side and eqs.([inner_product ] ) and ( [ mub_condition ] ) for the right - hand side , we obtain @xmath76 which is also one form of a necessary and sufficient condition for alice to guess bob s outcome with certainty .",
    "the condition ( [ l_condition ] ) turns out to be that of the existence of @xmath1 orthogonal @xmath0 by @xmath0 latin squares .",
    "first we introduce the definition of orthogonal latin squares formulated by wootters @xcite .    consider a collection of @xmath51 points , which can be regarded as points of a @xmath77 square lattice .",
    "they are divided into @xmath0 groups so that each group consists of @xmath0 points and any point belongs to only one group . a way of partitioning of this kind",
    "is called `` striation '' or @xmath77 latin square . two latin squares",
    "are said to be orthogonal if each group of either latin square has exactly one point in common with each group in the other .",
    "let us label a point by @xmath78 , a group by @xmath79 , and a latin square by @xmath23 .",
    "then a latin square @xmath23 is uniquely characterized by its `` striation function '' @xmath62 .",
    "namely , @xmath80 means that point @xmath40 in latin square @xmath23 belongs to group @xmath38 .",
    "now it is easy to see that the condition ( [ l_condition ] ) can be satisfied by some estimate @xmath62 if and only if there exist @xmath1 orthogonal @xmath77 latin squares",
    ". the if part is clear since the left - hand side of eq.([l_condition ] ) counts the number of common points belonging to group @xmath38 in latin square @xmath23 and group @xmath81 in latin square @xmath82 . on the other hand , summing over @xmath81 in eq.([l_condition ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 .",
    "this means estimate @xmath62 is a striation function and eq.([l_condition ] ) implies that two latin squares @xmath23 and @xmath82 are orthogonal if @xmath84 . an example of a set of 4 orthogonal @xmath85 latin squares is given in fig.1 .",
    "example of nine mutually unbiased strings and four orthogonal @xmath85 latin squares .",
    "on the left , strings @xmath62 as a @xmath86 matrix are shown . when each row is regarded as a string of length 4",
    ", any pair of nine strings shares a character at exactly one common place . on the right ,",
    "four mutually orthogonal @xmath85 latin squares are shown , which are constructed by the same @xmath62 interpreted as a striation function . in this example , @xmath87 is taken to be @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the site @xmath92 in a square is numbered by @xmath93.,width=302 ]    some known results on the maximum number @xmath94 of @xmath77 mutually orthogonal latin squares are summarized in @xcite as follows :    * for any @xmath0 , @xmath95 . * if @xmath0 is a power of a prime , @xmath96 .",
    "* @xmath97 . * if @xmath98 or @xmath99 is divisible by four , and if @xmath0 is not the sum of the squares of two integers , then @xmath100 . *",
    "@xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a power of a prime , there exists a maximal set of mub s in @xmath20 @xcite and there exist maximal @xmath1 orthogonal @xmath102 latin squares .",
    "the latter can be seen by explicitly constructing them with the striation function @xmath103 where @xmath104 on the right - hand side should be calculated under the rules of the field @xmath105 , which are reduced to the ordinary calculus modulo @xmath0 when @xmath0 is a prime .",
    "see fig.1 for an example in the case of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the mean king s problem of the type considered in this paper has a solution .",
    "this is what aravind has already shown explicitly @xcite , and the present paper provides an alternative proof .",
    "when @xmath0 is not a power of a prime , it is in general an open question how many mub s exist in @xmath20 .",
    "however , we know that there does not exist maximal @xmath1 orthogonal @xmath77 latin squares for @xmath2 or @xmath3 . thus we conclude that there is no solution to the king s problem of the type considered in this paper in these dimensions , even if there exists a maximal set of mub s .",
    "we have obtained two forms of conditions : the existence of @xmath51 mutually unbiased strings of length @xmath1 and @xmath1 orthogonal @xmath77 latin squares .",
    "both conditions are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution of the king s problem .",
    "this implies that the two conditions are equivalent to each other . in the next section , however , we will directly show the equivalence without resorting to the king s problem .",
    "as shown in the preceding section , the following relations are the existence conditions of @xmath51 mutually unbiased strings of length @xmath1 composed of a set of @xmath0 characters , @xmath106 where @xmath41 should be regarded as a character at the @xmath23th place of string @xmath107 . on the other hand , the existence of @xmath1 mutually orthogonal latin squares implies @xmath108 where @xmath62 should be interpreted as a striation function , meaning point @xmath40 in latin square @xmath23 belongs to group @xmath80 .",
    "we will show that the two conditions ( [ ss_condition ] ) and ( [ ll_condition ] ) are in fact equivalent as expected from the argument in the preceding section .",
    "we will show the equivalence by explicitly `` diagonalizing '' the two conditions .",
    "first we define the fourier transform of @xmath109 as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a primitive @xmath0th root of unity .",
    "we note that @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 , independent of @xmath23 and @xmath40 . in terms of the fourier",
    "transform @xmath114 , the two conditions ( [ ss_condition ] ) and ( [ ll_condition ] ) are then rewritten as @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "recalling @xmath117 , we introduce a @xmath118 matrix @xmath119 in the following way . here",
    "the subscript @xmath120 collectively represents either one of @xmath60 pairs @xmath121 or pair @xmath122 .",
    "let us define the matrix @xmath123 as @xmath124    the two conditions ( [ sss_condition ] ) and ( [ lll_condition ] ) turn out to be @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , which are evidently equivalent to each other .",
    "we thus conclude that a set of @xmath51 mutually unbiased strings with length @xmath1 is equivalent to the existence of @xmath1 mutually orthogonal @xmath77 latin squares .",
    "we have shown that a solution of the king s problem with mub s requires the maximal number of orthogonal latin squares .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that there is no solution to the problem in some composite number of dimensions ( 6 and 10 ) for which the maximal set of orthogonal latin squares is known not to exist .",
    "one can , however , ask whether there is a solution to the king s problem with non - mub s .",
    "let us impose three restrictions on the problem : the initial state prepared by alice is a maximally entangled state , alice can perform only a projective measurement ( not povm ) , and bob s set of measurement bases is complete .",
    "by completeness of a set of bases , we mean an unknown state is completely determined by repeated measurements in those bases , if infinitely many copies of the state are available .    in the case of @xmath16 , horibe _",
    "et al_.  @xcite studied the king s problem with non - mub s ( bases given by three nonorthogonal spin directions ) by allowing alice to perform povm measurement .",
    "it was found that a solution to the problem with the three restrictions exists only if the three spin directions are orthogonal ( mub s ) . for general dimensions ,",
    "we conjecture that the king s problem with the three restrictions has a solution only if the set of bases is the maximal set of mub s .",
    "it should be noted that we can construct a solution to the king s problem with non - mub s if the completeness condition of the bases is omitted .",
    "assume that a composite dimension @xmath0 is factored as @xmath127 by two prime powers .",
    "factoring the @xmath0-dimensional space into two subsystems with dimension @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we have a solution of the king s problem with @xmath130 mub s for each subsystem @xmath131 .",
    "now take @xmath1 bases on the composite system out of @xmath132 bases given by tensor products of the two mub s of subsystems .",
