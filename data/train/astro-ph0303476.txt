    "the discovery of quasars at redshifts greater than 6 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; fan et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "2003 ) has opened a window for spectroscopic exploration of the high redshift intergalactic medium .",
    "the detection of broad , black , ly@xmath3  absorption troughs , as predicted by gunn & peterson ( 1965 ; hereafter gp ) , indicates that we are beginning to probe the era when hydrogen was reionized by an early generation of stars .",
    "becker et al .  ( 2001 ) detected the first complete gp trough in the spectrum of sdssp  j103027.10@xmath0052455.0 ( @xmath1 ; hereafter sdss j1030@xmath00524 ) .",
    "they compared the absorption to that seen in the spectra of lower redshift quasars and concluded that the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm increases sharply at @xmath12 .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report that the most distant known quasar , sdss  j114816.64@xmath0525150.3 ( @xmath2 for a discussion of the @xmath13 redshift derived by willott , mclure & jarvis ( 2003 ) for this object . ] ; hereafter sdss j1148@xmath05251 ) , also shows a complete gp trough in its spectrum .",
    "djorgovski , castro , stern & mahabal ( 2001 ) argued that the spectra of even lower redshift quasars show indications of neutral regions in the igm .",
    "there ensued a spate of theoretical papers discussing the details of how reionization takes place .",
    "but the most exciting new observational result is undoubtedly the discovery by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) that the microwave background has traversed a moderate optical depth ( @xmath14 ) electron scattering medium , implying that the universe must have been ionized at @xmath1520 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) . at first glance",
    "this appears inconsistent with reionization at @xmath12 , but since a relatively small neutral fraction ( @xmath16% ) would suffice to produce black gp troughs , the results are not contradictory .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the ionization history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was complex .",
    "wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) suggested that the hydrogen in the igm could have been reionized twice , and cen ( 2003 ) argued that two phases of reionization are likely under a wide range of conditions . in this scenario ,",
    "the first reionization occurs at @xmath17 , driven by the formation of massive , zero - metallicity population  iii stars ( venkatesan , tumlinson & shull 2003 ; mackey , bromm & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "the ionizing radiation from massive stars is dramatically reduced , however , when pop  iii supernovae seed the gas with metals ( due to a reduction in the formation of massive stars , increased line - blanketing in hot star atmospheres , and increased mass loss rates from both hot stars and red giants . )",
    "consequently the igm recombines and remains relatively neutral , @xmath18 , until an increasing pop  ii massive star population and a declining igm density allow the second reionization to occur at @xmath12 .",
    "this neutral fraction is sufficient to produce the observed high optical depths in the ly@xmath3  gp troughs of high redshift quasars .    to advance our understanding of the ionization history of the universe ,",
    "we need high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the igm absorption at @xmath10 . recently",
    "several groups have discovered ly@xmath3-emitting galaxies at @xmath19 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 , kodaira et al .",
    "these objects are interesting and relevant as direct probes of star and galaxy formation at @xmath10 , and the mere detectability of their ly@xmath3  emission is an important clue to the ionization state of the igm ( haiman 2002 ) . however , their continua are far too faint ( even redward of ly@xmath3 ) to make them useful for studies of the intervening igm .",
    "only high - redshift quasars offer the possibility of acquiring high quality information on the state of the igm at high redshift .",
    "in this paper we present high quality spectra of the only two quasars known to have gp absorption troughs4637 at @xmath20 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) could also have a gp trough , but our recent spectra show that it has strong , intrinsic , broad absorption lines that make it less useful for studies of the igm at @xmath10 ( fan et al",

    "spectra of sdss j1030@xmath00524  and sdss j1148@xmath05251  were taken with the keck echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",

    "the sky brightness varies as a function of time in a complex way in the near infrared , with the atmospheric oh emission varying rapidly and independently of other sky emission .",
    "in addition the esi spectrograph , though a highly stable instrument , does undergo small changes over time , with the wavelengths shifting slightly from one observation to the next .",
    "presumably these changes ( which are typically at the level of a few tenths of a pixel or less ) are due to minor thermal and gravity - induced flexures .",
    "we extract a sky - subtracted spectrum from each independent observation .",
    "the separate spectra are then combined using weights to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the result .",
    "it is necessary to be very careful with the weights for combining to avoid any bias in the results .",
    "a simple unweighted average is safely free of bias but leads to a much noisier spectrum than an optimally weighted sum . on the other hand , using weights @xmath24 with @xmath25 derived from the noise estimates of the individual spectra leads to a very noticeable bias toward lower flux values , because the estimated noise is larger for brighter pixels . in the black absorption troughs",
    "this leads to fluxes that are systematically negative .",
    "the dangers of using a weighted combination for poisson data are well - documented ( for a nice analysis , see wheaton et al .",
    "the cure for the bias is to choose weights that are completely independent of the data .",
    "we have combined the spectra using weights that are derived from the sky noise in adjacent pixels ( i.e. , along the slit ) .",
    "note that using the sky noise from the same pixel would still lead to a small bias , because pixels that have positive sky fluctuations ( making the residual counts a little low ) would be given slightly lower weights , thus leading to a positive bias in the sum . using",
    "the sky noise in neighboring pixels produces a completely unbiased result that has a nearly optimal signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "an overall scale factor is determined for each spectrum to match the fluxes , thereby correcting for variable atmospheric transparency .",
    "our extraction algorithm is highly customized for esi data , which have a number of unusual characteristics ( e.g. , highly curved orders , a strongly non - linear wavelength dispersion , and some odd notches in the sensitivity in the bluer orders . ) the images are first geometrically rectified to produce orders with orthogonal wavelength and spatial coordinates lying along rows and columns .",
    "this removes the very large curvature of the esi echelle orders and also corrects small variations in the wavelength dispersion along the slit that manifest themselves as tilted or curved sky lines .",
    "the order curvature removal also automatically corrects the spectral trace for differential atmospheric refraction using the airmass of the observation ; this approach is more effective than tracing the orders directly because high - redshift quasar spectra have long stretches with no detectable light , foiling standard tracing algorithms .",
    "the resampling algorithm used in the rectification is a flux - conserving interpolation scheme that is accurate to second order in the pixel shifts ( as opposed to the more commonly used schemes that are only first order , making them considerably more dispersive . ) the interpolation method is based on the high - order , monotonic , flux - conserving advection schemes that are widely used in modern hydrodynamic simulations ( van leer 1977 ) .",
    "extraction of spectra from the rectified orders is straightforward .",
    "we use an optimal extraction algorithm with a second - order fit to the sky along the slit and a spatial profile that is assumed constant for each order . for orders where the profile is not detected , the trace position and width",
    "are predicted based on those orders that are detected .",
    "the wavelength scale derived from calibration lamps is adjusted using the positions of sky lines for each observation .",
    "the final spectra for the quasars are shown in figure  [ fig - spectra ] .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectra promise two improvements in our understanding of the gp troughs . by reducing the noise in the black regions of the spectrum , they improve our lower limits on the absorbing optical depth and may allow us to detect faint light in the dark troughs .",
    "but since the optical depth limits increase only as the logarithm of the signal - to - noise ratio , which itself increases only as the square root of the integration time , it is difficult to make dramatic improvements in the limits .",
    "the main benefit of high signal - to - noise ratio spectra is that they allow us to set strong detection limits over narrower bands in the spectra .",
    "the optical depth distribution is very unlikely to be a smooth function of redshift ; instead , at the transition between a neutral and an ionized igm , there will be ionized , partially transparent bubbles sprinkled along the line of sight . to detect these bubbles we need to be able to recognize narrow emission spikes in the trough where the quasar light leaks through the igm .",
    "the new spectra presented in the paper are far better for that purpose than our earlier observations ( which were 30  min exposures taken with esi . )",
    "we begin with an approach similar to that used by becker et al .",
    "the residual fluxes in the gp troughs of ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  are measured directly from the spectra ; the fluxes are weighted using the sky noise from adjacent pixels ( as described above for the extraction ) to improve the signal - to - noise ratio while avoiding bias in the sums . then the mean transmission and optical depth of the igm",
    "are determined by comparing the residual flux to the ( unabsorbed ) quasar continuum at the positions of the troughs .",
    "because very little neutral hydrogen is required to create a gp trough in ly@xmath3  ( a 1% neutral fraction will suffice ) , the presence of a gp trough due to ly@xmath3  provides only a lower limit to the amount of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the gp trough from the ly@xmath4  transition can be a more sensitive test because the ly@xmath4  cross - section is a factor of 5.27 lower than ly@xmath3 .",
    "interpretation of the ly@xmath4  trough is complicated by the fact that it is overlaid by the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath26 , which is unpredictable along a given line of sight due to cosmic variance . in spite of that , using fairly secure assumptions , the ly@xmath4  trough can give much stronger limits on the neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "we consequently measure residual fluxes in both the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  absorption regions .",
    "we also considered using the ly@xmath27  absorption since ly@xmath27  has an even lower intrinsic optical depth .",
    "however , the ly@xmath27  gp trough suffers from overlying absorption by both ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  at lower redshifts and consequently does not give additional useful information .",
    "it is necessary to estimate the brightness of the quasar continuum at the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  troughs in order to measure the transmission of the igm . for this purpose",
    "we use the far uv quasar power law spectrum of telfer , zheng , kriss , & davidsen ( 2002 ) and the composite spectrum from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; francis et al .",
    "the templates are matched to the observed spectra at a rest wavelength of @xmath28   .",
    "the telfer et al .",
    "power law has a break near 1280    and rises less steeply into the uv than a simple extrapolation of the continuum redward of ly@xmath3 .",
    "in the near uv ( @xmath29   ) , the spectral slope is @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , while in the far uv ( @xmath32   ) , @xmath33 for radio - quiet objects and @xmath34 for radio - loud objects . while there is no evidence that either of our quasars is radio - loud , we compute continuum levels using both euv slopes in order to represent the range of continua seen in quasars .",
    "broad emission lines can also contribute to the continuum .",
    "our spectra are displayed in figures  [ fig - atemplate ] and  [ fig - btemplate ] along with the lbqs composite spectrum . for these figures",
    ", our spectra have been denoised using a wavelet shrinkage algorithm ( donoho & johnstone 1994 ) that is optimized for the case where the noise amplitude is variable but known ( heteroscedastic data , in the parlance of statisticians ) .",
    "we use a haar ( 1910 ) wavelet transform , which allows error propagation and has the great benefit of keeping the noise in transform space uncorrelated at each scale before the filtering is applied .",
    "cycle - spinning ( coifman & donoho 1995 ) is utilized to make the result shift - invariant and to remove the artifacts generated by the square - wave haar basis functions .    denoising thus uses a variable smoothing length to suppress the noise as much as possible on all scales while remaining consistent with the spectrum given the estimated noise array .",
    "the resulting spectrum is heavily smoothed in flat regions ( such as the dark troughs ) , which suppresses the noise .",
    "( values in the smoothed areas are consequently highly correlated . )",
    "the smoothing threshold is set to @xmath35 , so only structures more significant than that remain in the spectrum .",
    "note that high resolution structures are preserved ( compare the absorption on the blue edge of the ly@xmath3  emission with fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] ) while the noise in both the continuum and the troughs is dramatically reduced .    for sdss j1030@xmath00524  ( fig .",
    "[ fig - atemplate ] ) , the lbqs composite is clearly a good match to the spectrum , so we estimate the continuum in the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  absorption troughs using the mean flux in the relevant wavelength window from the lbqs spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "sdss j1148@xmath05251  shows considerably weaker emission lines than the composite ( fig .",
    "[ fig - btemplate ] ) ; we therefore use the telfer et al .",
    "power law continuum alone as the estimate of the brightness at the absorption troughs .",
    "the continua estimated by using these different templates differ by about 30% .",
    "for sdss j1030@xmath00524 , our results can be described very simply : the gp absorption troughs of both ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  are very black .",
    "there is no evidence of any residual light in the troughs to the limit of our observations .",

    "the correction factor for ly@xmath3  forest absorption overlying the ly@xmath4  gp trough was taken to be 0.11 , from figure  2 of becker et al .",
    "the @xmath63 errors on the transmission are smaller than for sdss j1030@xmath00524 , both because the seeing and photometric conditions were slightly better for sdss j1148@xmath05251  and because its continuum is brighter .",
    "in contrast to sdss j1030@xmath00524 , there is light detected in the gp troughs of sdss j1148@xmath05251  both in narrow spikes and in broader bands .",
    "the mean transmission nonetheless remains low .",
    "figure  [ fig - tau_vs_z ] summarizes the ly@xmath3  optical depth as a function of redshift , including additional high - redshift quasars from fan et al .",
    "there is a noticeable steepening of the @xmath68 relationship at @xmath69 .    a closer examination of the troughs reveals some interesting features .",
    "the ly@xmath3  trough extends from @xmath70 to 6.32 and looks dark at high resolution except for a weak emission spike at @xmath7 .",
    "the reality of that peak is supported by its coincidence with a ly@xmath4  emission peak at the same redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig - troughs ] ) .",
    "we believe this is likely to be a real detection of an ionized bubble in the igm that permits quasar light to leak through at the redshift of the bubble ; this feature is discussed in detail below (  [ section-6.08 ] ) .",
    "several emission spikes are detected in the ly@xmath4  trough as well .",
    "two especially strong peaks are seen at 7205    and 7236    ( ly@xmath4  redshifts of @xmath71 and 6.06 ) .",
    "there also is significant non - zero flux in the troughs even between the peaks ( best seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - troughsnr ] ) .",
    "if this flux is quasar light transmitted by the igm , it certainly suggests strongly that the igm is not very neutral at @xmath12 .",
    "that interpretation is not so clear cut , however .",
    "we argue below (  [ section - intervening ] ) for the alternative interpretation that both the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  troughs are contaminated by light from an intervening galaxy at @xmath60 .",
    "if that suggestion is correct , the optical depths derived from the troughs of sdss j1148@xmath05251  are only lower limits .",
    "the universe at @xmath12 was very likely ionized by galaxies rather than by quasars , since there do not appear to be enough quasars to do the job ( fan et al .",
    ". there must have been regions in the preionized universe where a concentration of unusually luminous galaxies ( possibly the precursor to a massive cluster ) was capable of ionizing the nearby igm , creating an ionized bubble .",
    "it is therefore not surprising to find weak emission spikes embedded in the mostly black gp troughs ( figs .",
    "[ fig - troughs ] and  [ fig - troughsnr ] ) where the line - of - sight to the quasar passes through small `` holes '' in the igm ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  transmission created by ionized bubbles .",
    "that can also explain the detection of ly@xmath3-emitting galaxies at @xmath19 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 , kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ) , which in this picture ought to be found in concentrations with other galaxies .    according to the scenario presented by cen ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the universe is first ionized at @xmath17 by pop  iii stars and then recombines to become substantially neutral , with neutral fractions remaining above 0.1 until the second reionization occurs at @xmath12 . at @xmath6 to 7 the neutral fraction @xmath72 is typically @xmath73 .",
    "as cen points out , that makes it easier to detect high redshift galaxies ; it also makes it easier for lower luminosity sources to create ionized bubbles .",
    "the peak seen in the ly@xmath3  trough of sdss j1148@xmath05251  at 8600    ( @xmath7 ) has an intensity about 8% of the extrapolated ( pre - absorption ) continuum , implying an igm optical depth of @xmath74 . the optical depth of this window at ly@xmath4  would be only about 0.5 , which would produce a very strong peak in the ly@xmath4  trough ; but since the overlying ly@xmath3  forest absorption is expected to reduce that by a factor of 0.11 ( corresponding to an overlying optical depth @xmath75 ) , the expected amplitude of the ly@xmath4  trough peak is in fact very similar to that observed , albeit with a rather large uncertainty in the ly@xmath3  forest attenuation .",
    "how large would an ionized region need to be to produce this feature ?",
    "the damping wings from neutral hydrogen on either side of the ionized bubble create a high optical depth through the region unless the bubble is relatively large .",
    "this led barkana ( 2002 ) to question djorgovski et al.s ( 2001 ) argument that dark regions in the spectrum of a lower redshift were created by neutral regions of the igm .",
    "miralda - escud ( 1998 ; see also barkana 2002 ) derived the ly@xmath3  damping wing optical depth for hydrogen extending from @xmath76 to @xmath77 when observed at a wavelength @xmath78 : @xmath79 \\quad , \\label{eqn - taudamp}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the gunn - peterson optical depth , @xmath81 and we are using a @xmath82 cosmology with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the function @xmath87 is defined to be @xmath88 given an ionized region at redshift @xmath89 , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - taudamp ] ) allows us compute the combined damping wing optical depth from the neutral regions on either side of the bubble .",
    "although the constant factor multiplying @xmath80 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - taudamp ] ) is small , the leading term in @xmath87 can be very large near @xmath90 or @xmath77 , so @xmath91 can be substantial .",
    "figure  [ fig - taudamp ] displays the resulting optical depth for a bubble located at @xmath7 .",
    "the neutral igm is assumed to extend from @xmath6 to @xmath92 , but the results are relatively insensitive to those limits .",
    "the bubble diameter required to produce a window with @xmath93 is 1.33  mpc if the igm is completely neutral outside the bubble .",
    "if the igm is already partly ionized , the required bubble size is much smaller ( 0.22  mpc if @xmath94 ) .",
    "barkana ( 2002 ) computed the diameter of an bubble as a function of the halo mass @xmath95 of the ionizing source ( including the escape probability for ionizing photons in a low metallicity galaxy ) to be @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of ionizing photons per baryon that escape the galaxy .",
    "we can invert this to get the mass required to produce a bubble of a given diameter : @xmath98 we conclude that a plausible star - forming galaxy ( or group of galaxies ) along the line of sight can produce the observed peak at @xmath7 in the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  gp troughs of sdss j1148@xmath05251 , even if the surrounding igm is completely neutral .",
    "obviously if the igm is partly ionized , the required bubble diameter would be much smaller ( fig .",

    "there is , however , another possible explanation for the strong peaks in the ly@xmath4  trough of sdss j1148@xmath05251 . a careful examination of the quasar spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig - civ ] ) reveals a strong absorption feature at 9200a ( @xmath115 ) . that suggests a second interpretation for the spikes , namely that they are ly@xmath3  emission from a foreground galaxy at @xmath115 .",
    "usually one does not see emission associated with absorbers ; but ordinarily such emission lines would be lost in the ly@xmath3  forest and not noticed .",
    "this particular emission line , falling as it does in the ly@xmath4  trough , stands out like a sore thumb .",

    "is it plausible that the emission in the ly@xmath4  trough could be from an intervening @xmath8 galaxy ?",
    "the implied ly@xmath3  luminosities are similar to those of ly@xmath3  emitters detected in the subaru deep field at @xmath116 ( ouchi et al .",
    "moreover , the velocity offset between the ly@xmath3  emission and the absorption seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - civ ] is in the range typically observed for systems that show both ly@xmath3  emission and metal line absorption ( @xmath117  km / s , shapley et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the main argument against the intervening emission model is that ly@xmath3  emitters are sufficiently rare on the sky that it is unlikely to find one along a random line - of - sight . but perhaps this is not a random line - of - sight .",
    "figure  [ fig - civ ] shows that there are both multiple ly@xmath3  emission components and multiple absorption components present in the spectrum ( note particularly the structure in both components of the strong doublet at 9200   . )",
    "the two presumed ly@xmath3  lines are split by 1200  km / s , and the structure extends over at least 250  km / s .",
    "it is possible that there is a massive structure ( a protocluster ? ) along the line - of - sight that is amplifying the quasar through gravitational lensing . if that is correct , then the likelihood of finding a ly@xmath3  emitter in front of the @xmath2 quasar is in fact not so small , since the foreground object assisted in the discovery of the quasar by boosting its apparent brightness .",
    "even lensing by a factor of two might create a strong discovery bias since the luminosity function is steep for bright quasars ( wyithe & loeb 2002 ; comerford , haiman & schaye 2002 ) .    for the more familiar case where a nearby ( @xmath118 ) galaxy is lensing a high - redshift quasar , the lensing magnification is limited to less than @xmath119 because stronger lensing produces multiple images with a noticeably wide splitting .",
    "but when the lens redshift is @xmath26 , as in the scenario proposed here , the einstein ring radius is much smaller and so the splitting could not have been detected from the ground ( in agreement with the imaging observations by fan et al .  2003 . )",
    "figure  [ fig - lens ] shows the magnification and observed image positions as a function of impact parameter for a singular isothermal sphere galaxy model with a velocity dispersion of 250  km / s .",
    "this velocity dispersion is consistent with the velocity structure seen in the strong absorption system and is slightly larger than the dispersion expected for an @xmath120 galaxy ( @xmath121  km / s ) . in this geometry ,",
    "the multiple image separation is only 0.3  arcsec , which would be difficult to detect even if the components were of equal brightness .",
    "note also that since there are multiple absorption and ly@xmath3  emission components , it is possible that there are multiple lensing galaxies along the line - of - sight to this source .",
    "that could possibly increase the amplification factor further , although it would also lead to larger splitting and shifts .",
    "we coadded the two - dimensional spectra of sdss j1148@xmath05251  for the echelle order that includes the ly@xmath4  trough to search for evidence that the peaks are either broader than the quasar trace or are shifted relative to the center of the trace .",
    "neither effect was seen .",
    "the width of the peaks agrees with the width of the rest of the order , and the central positions agree to better than 0.1(which is the approximate uncertainty in the trace position . )",
    "this appears to be the most problematic aspect of interpreting these peaks as ly@xmath3  emission from a foreground lensing galaxy : we see no direct evidence any any images ( including the spectrum ) for lensing .",
    "that does not contradict the lensing hypothesis given the small lens scale at @xmath60 , but neither does it provide any additional support .",
    "and there is certainly reason to think it unlikely that we would stumble across a lens with such a small einstein ring radius , since the area on the sky that is lensed by such objects is rather small .",
    "but as we discuss below , the additional supporting evidence in favor of the hypothesis is sufficient to make a reasonably strong case .",
    "a puzzling aspect of the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  gp trough transmissions for sdss j1148@xmath05251  is that the ly@xmath3  residual flux is far higher than expected from the ly@xmath4  flux .",
    "this is reflected in table  2 by the fact that @xmath122 inferred from the ly@xmath4  trough is far higher than the optical depth actually measured in ly@xmath3 .",
    "either there is too much light in ly@xmath3  trough or there is too little in the ly@xmath4  trough ( which presumably would require a great deal of extra absorption in the @xmath26 ly@xmath3  forest . ) neither explanation appears particularly palatable based on a conventional model of a quasar with igm absorption .",
    "an intervening ly@xmath3-emitting galaxy at @xmath60 offers a more natural explanation : the ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath4  troughs are contaminated by continuum emission from the galaxy .",
    "we find that the observed brightness of the continuum is fully consistent with the hypothesis of an intervening galaxy , which strongly supports our suggestion .",
    "wyithe & loeb ( 2002 ) pointed out that a lensing galaxy could contaminate the black gp trough , although they were concerned mainly with lensing by low redshift galaxies ( which is a priori considerably more likely . )    between 8420    and 8900    ( @xmath70 to 6.32 ) , the only obvious emission in the ly@xmath3  trough is the peak at @xmath7 discussed above ( fig .",

    "we take that as an estimate of the brightness of the galaxy continuum .",
    "the ab magnitude of the flux detected in the ly@xmath3  trough is 26.4 , which corresponds to an absolute ab magnitude of @xmath125 at a rest wavelength of 1450    if the light comes from a galaxy at @xmath60 .",
    "the observed equivalent width ( ew ) of the peak at 7205    is then 930   , and the rest - frame ew is 160 .",
    "this ew is perfectly consistent with the ew distribution determined by malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) for ly@xmath3-emitting galaxies at @xmath126 .",
    "it is slightly lower than the median ew for their sample , as is expected for a more massive galaxy ( malhotra & rhoads , private communication ) .",
    "many authors have discussed the possibility that high - redshift quasars are selected because they are strongly lensed .",
    "wyithe & loeb ( 2002 ) and comerford , haiman , & schaye ( 2002 ) determined how lensing might bias the quasar luminosity function .",
    "haiman & cen ( 2002 ; hereafter hc ) considered the specific case of lensing of sdss j1030@xmath00524 ; they argue that if the quasar is embedded in a largely neutral igm , the large extent of its region implies that it must in fact have a large ionizing luminosity and so can not have been too strongly lensed .",
    "if the ionizing luminosity were too low , the igm near the quasar would have remained neutral and so the ly@xmath3  emission line would have been much more heavily absorbed on the blue side .",
    "this argument also sets a minimum age for the quasar , since it must have been in existence long enough to ionize a substantial strmgren sphere .",
    "the hc result is directly relevant to the question of whether sdss j1148@xmath05251  could be strongly gravitationally lensed . on the blue side of ly@xmath3 ,",

    "according to hc  see also madau & rees ( 2000 ) , cen & haiman ( 2000 ) and references therein  the radius of a strmgren sphere ionized by a high - redshift quasar as a function of time is approximately @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the ionizing photon luminosity , @xmath129 is the age of the quasar , and as above we use cosmological parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath130 .",
    "this formula results from matching the total number of ionizing photons emitted to the number of hydrogen atoms within a sphere , and it ignores both recombinations ( which reduce the radius ) and the hubble expansion ( which increases it . ) it uses the mean igm density assuming that the igm contains nearly all the baryons ; if the universe is locally overdense by a factor @xmath131 , the radius is reduced by @xmath132 .",

    "such a short lifetime for sdss j1148@xmath05251  would be surprising , since its high luminosity implies a large black - hole mass which should take a considerable length of time to assemble .",
    "the @xmath140-folding timescale for an accreting black hole is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath143 is the ratio of the quasar s luminosity to the eddington luminosity ( haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "this long natural timescale makes it unlikely that we will observe quasars with ages as short as a few hundred thousand years unless the radiative efficiency @xmath142 is very low , allowing the quasar to accrete quietly and rapidly .    on the other hand ,",
    "following hc s argument , if the quasar is lensed then its true luminosity could be substantially smaller . with a plausible age of @xmath144  yrs , sdss j1148@xmath05251  could be easily lensed by a factor of 3 or more and still be able to ionize the igm out to the observed distance of 2.8  mpc .",

    "one more point that is worth making is that these discrepancies become even greater if the igm is not completely neutral at @xmath12 .",
    "the expected value of @xmath145 decreases in direct proportion to the neutral fraction of the gas , so if the igm at @xmath6 has @xmath146 as suggested by cen ( 2003 ) , the quasar would have to be very highly magnified through lensing , in an extremely overdense region of the igm , or extraordinarily young in order to produce an region as small as that we observe .",
    "what other explanations could there be for the small region observed in front of sdss j1148@xmath05251 ?",
    "one possibility is that the redshift of sdss j1148@xmath05251  is underestimated , which would increase the observed size of the ionized region .",
    "if the quasar redshift is 6.41 instead of 6.37 ( willott , mclure & jarvis 2003 ) , the strmgren radius increases to 4.7  mpc .",

    ". matching the lbqs composite spectrum to the emission line detected at @xmath147 m by willott et al .  ( 2003 ) reveals that @xmath2 matches the data about as well as @xmath13 ; in fact , from the lbqs spectrum , which does include the offsets typically seen between the redshifts of different emission lines , a redshift of 6.41 would appear to be an upper limit for sdss j1148@xmath05251 .",
    "it will probably require higher snr infrared spectra of this object to resolve the question of its true redshift .",
    "another possibility is that clumpy structure in the igm conspires to limit the size of the strmgren sphere along the line of sight .",
    "certainly there is substantial igm structure near the quasar , as it can be seen in the narrow absorption lines on the blue edge of the ly@xmath3  emission line for wavelengths approaching the gp trough .",
    "a cloudy igm can also modify the radiative transfer for ionizing radiation so that the strmgren sphere is not fully ionized ( cen & haiman 2000 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that gas within the ionized region contributes substantially to the observed ly@xmath3  optical depth .",
    "however , these effects ought to be relatively small for regions that are still in their very early phase of relativistic expansion ( see appendix  a ) . in that phase",
    "there is a surfeit of ionizing photons , with far more photons present than are required to ionize the neutral hydrogen .",
    "the expansion rate of the ionization front is limited by the light - travel time ; recombinations are completely negligible , and even dense gas clumps are fully ionized by the copious radiation .    stopping the ionization front with a dense cloud along the line of sight",
    "is difficult for the same reason .",
    "for example , suppose there is a dense cloud in the igm at @xmath92 .",
    "if the cloud is optically thick to lyman continuum radiation , it will stop the strmgren sphere expansion , thus producing an anomalously small ionized region .",
    "a cloud dense enough to stop the ionization front must have a density greater than @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the case b recombination coefficient and @xmath150 is the line - of - sight distance through the cloud .",
    "if we assume the cloud is spherical , its mass is @xmath151 the cloud would have to be either dense or quite massive to stop the quasar s ionization front .",
    "another possible explanation for the small size of the ionized region is that the edge of the observed emission at @xmath92 does not indicate the edge of the ionized gas .",
    "only a trace of neutral hydrogen is needed to generate a large optical depth to ly@xmath3   ( eq .  [ eqn - taugp ] ) .",
    "consequently , if the ionization fraction in the region drops below @xmath152 , the igm becomes opaque .",
    "this can occur if radiation transfer in the clumpy igm reduces the ionizing flux seen by the gas .",
    "this also appears unlikely in the strmgren sphere s relativistic expansion phase , but more detailed calculations are required to confirm that @xmath92 really marks the position of the quasar s ionization front .",
    "one might wonder whether the arguments presented in favor of a foreground object lensing sdss j1148@xmath05251  could also be applied to sdss j1030@xmath00524 .",

    "for example , suppose a quasar shines for a period @xmath171 and then shuts down . according to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - rs ] ) , at @xmath171 the radius of the region is @xmath180 .",
    "but the observer measures a radius @xmath181 ( eq .  [ eqn - rsobs ] ) .",
    "what is happening in this case is that the region continues to expand after the quasar shuts off until it reaches a maximum size @xmath181 at @xmath182 . at that point",
    "the inner sphere in figure  [ fig - rsdiag ] is completely empty of ionizing photons and so the expansion stops .",
    "the observer is detecting ly@xmath3  photons that were emitted just at the end of the quasar s lifetime , but by the time those photons cross the ionization front it has expanded to its maximum size .",
    "our conclusion is that when all the light travel time effects are taken into account , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn - rsobs ] ) is the correct formula for computing the age of the quasar given the luminosity .",
    "ages determined using that formula are , in fact , the age of the quasar at the time it emitted the photons being detected , and so such ages are direct measurements of the minimum quasar lifetime even during the superluminal expansion phase .",
