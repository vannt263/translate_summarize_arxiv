    "it is still a mystery why ( only ) a small fraction of agns exhibit double - peaked broad - line profiles .",
    "some different scenarios were suggested for the origin of double - peaked emission lines , namely , ( 1 ) emission from the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 2 ) emission from a binary broad - line region ( blr ) in a binary massive black hole system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( 3 ) emission from the bipolar outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 4 ) emission from a spherically symmetric blr illuminated by an anisotropic ionizing radiation source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion disk model is the most favorable one among them ( see detailed comparison between these different scenarios in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the accretion disk model ,",
    "the double - peaked emission lines are radiated from the disk region between around several hundred gravitational radii to more than two thousand gravitational radii , and their profiles can be well fitted by the accretion disks with a power - law line emissivity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , none of these scenarios can answer why only a small fraction of agns have been detected as double - peaked line emitters .",
    "for example , in the accretion disk model , one may expect to observe double - peaked lines in most agns , as the agns with higher inclination angles have more chances to be observed , until their accretion disks are obscured by the putative tori ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , if the orientations of agns are isotropically distributed in space .",
    "another difficulty for the disk model is the  energy budget \" problem , i.e. , the local viscously dissipated power in the line - emitting disk portion is usually insufficient for the observed double - peaked broad - line luminosity in most sources , and the temperatures of the line - emitting disk regions are too low to produce the observed h@xmath9 lines @xcite .",
    "the x - rays from a hot ion - supported torus in the inner disk region are assumed to irradiate the outer line - emitting disk region and then to solve the  energy budget \" problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we discuss the illumination of the outer disk regions by the inner ion - supported tori in  2 . in this paper , we suggest a physical model for these double - peaked line emitters . in this model ,",
    "a fraction of photons from the accretion disk are scattered by the electrons in the jet / outflow back to photo - ionize the outer line - emitting region , and then to produce the observed emission lines .",

    "some other factors , such as , the viewing angle and the properties of the accretion disk , may play important roles in producing double - peaked lines . the quantitative model calculations to fit the line profiles for individual agns are beyond the scope of this work , which will be reported in the forthcoming paper .    in this work",

    "another possibility is that slow outflows play the same role in radio - loud double - peaked line emitters as radio - quiet sources , though it is still unclear whether relativitic jets can co - exist with such cold outflows in radio - loud double - peaked line emitters .",
    "however , it is unable to explain the fact that no double - peaked emission line is present in strong radio quasars with relativistic jets , while this is a natural prediction of the electron - positron jet model proposed in this work .",

    "<S> the double - peaked broad emission lines are usually thought to be linked to accretion disks , however , the local viscous heating in the line - emitting disk portion is usually insufficient for the observed double - peaked broad - line luminosity in most sources . it was suggested that the x - ray radiation from an ion - supported torus in the inner region of the disk can photo - ionize the outer line - emitting disk region . </S>",
    "<S> however , our calculations show that only a small fraction ( @xmath0 2.3 per cent ) of the radiation from the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) in the inner region of the disk can photo - ionize the line - emitting disk portion , because the solid angle of the outer disk portion subtended to the inner region of the riaf is too small . we propose a physical model for double - peaked line emitters , in which only those agns with sufficient matter above the disk ( slowly moving jets or outflows ) can scatter enough photons radiated from the inner disk region to the outer line - emitting disk portion extending from several hundred to more than two thousand gravitational radii . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts a power - law @xmath1-dependent line emissivity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , which is consistent with @xmath4 required by the model fittings for double - peaked line profiles . using a sample of radio - loud agns with double - peaked emission lines , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the outer disk regions can be efficiently illuminated by the photons scattered from slow or mild relativistic electron - positron jets with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with the fact that no double - peaked emission line is present in strong radio quasars with relativistic jets . for radio - quiet double - peaked line emitters , slow outflows with thomson scattering depth @xmath6 instead of jets can scatter sufficient photons to ( illuminate ) the line - emitting regions . </S>",
    "<S> this model can therefore solve the energy budget problem for double - peaked line emitters . </S>"
