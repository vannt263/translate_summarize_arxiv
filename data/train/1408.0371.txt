    "schwenk s argument plus some simple combinatorial ideas can be used to show that whenever we can arrange two edge disjoint petersen graphs on the same vertex set , then the complement of their union must be the bipartite cubic graph on @xmath21 vertices that is the bipartite complement of @xmath22 . in figure",
    "[ f : twopeters ] , every missing edge goes from the set of @xmath16 outer vertices to the set of @xmath16 inner vertices , so the complement of the union of the two petersen graphs is visibly bipartite ( see @xcite for a proof ) .",

    "our purpose in this paper is to extend this investigation by replacing the petersen graph by an arbitrary graph .",

    "if @xmath1 is even , @xmath15 can be partitioned into hamiltonian cycles , but @xmath3 can not if @xmath2 is odd , since @xmath1 does not divide @xmath29 for @xmath1 even and @xmath2 odd .",

    "each of the @xmath37 pairs of points is covered equally often by an edge in one of these images , since @xmath35 is doubly transitive ; double counting gives this number to be @xmath38 , as required.@xmath39    our main result is a description of the set @xmath5 .    for any graph @xmath0 , there is a positive integer @xmath4 and a finite set @xmath40 of multiples of @xmath4 such that @xmath41 .",
    "we call the number @xmath4 the _ partition modulus _ of @xmath0 , and denote it by @xmath42 .",
    "the theorem follows immediately from a couple of simple lemmas .",
