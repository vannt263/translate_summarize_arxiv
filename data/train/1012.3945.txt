    "the dynamics of crack propagation is an important and long standing mystery in solid - state physics and materials science @xcite , and in the recent years the physics community experienced a rebirth of interest in the problem of dynamic fracture .",
    "the fundamental basis of today s understanding of the phenomenon fracture traces back to griffith @xcite , who realized that the growth of cracks is determined by a competition of a release of elastic energy and a simultaneous increase of the surface energy due to the advancing crack .",
    "the uniform motion of a crack is relatively well understood in the framework of continuum theories @xcite . here ,",
    "the conventional approach is to treat the crack as a front or interface separating broken and unbroken regions of the material ; propagation is governed by the balance of the elastic forces in the materials and cohesive stresses near the crack tip @xcite .",
    "many characteristic features of crack propagation are nowadays well established by experimental studies @xcite .",
    "as soon as the flux of energy to the crack tip exceeds a critical value , the crack becomes unstable and starts to branch while emitting sound waves .",
    "these phenomena are consistent with the continuum theory of sharp crack tips , but it fails to describe them , because the details of crack growth , in particular the chosen crack path and velocity , depend on details of cohesion on microscopic scales @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , empirical energy balances and simple propagation laws that are frequently used in engineering applications , can not account for the richness of actual fracture phenomena .",
    "in particular , they can not predict dynamical instabilities of fast moving cracks",
    ". the fundamental mechanisms of these instabilities have been extremely difficult to elucidate because they appear to result from a non - trivial coupling between dynamical phenomena inside the crack tip region , known as _ process zone _ , and ( linear ) elasticity , with no clear separation of scale between atoms and the system size .",
    "large scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with about @xmath0 atoms allowed to get deeper insights into the growth behavior of cracks @xcite .",
    "although limited to submicron samples and very short timescales , these simulations were able to reproduce key features of crack propagation like the initial acceleration and the onset of instabilities . nevertheless , a detailed understanding of the complex physics of crack propagation , in particular aspects of the pattern formation process , still remain a major challenge @xcite .    at this level ,",
    "continuum descriptions , in particular phase field methods that avoid dynamical artifacts which are associated with the breaking of translational and rotational symmetry @xcite , offer a useful and complementary perspective on crack propagation as a pattern formation process .",
    "the past years have seen intense activities in phase field modeling of crack propagation ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and of defects in general @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a continuum description of crack propagation in the spirit of interfacial pattern formation processes .",
    "inspired by the discovery of the asaro - tiller - grinfeld ( atg ) instability @xcite , we understand fracture as late and highly nonlinear stage of this elastically driven interfacial instability . in its early stage , a linear stability analysis of a solid surface under uniaxial",
    "load reveals that long wave morphological perturbations are unstable in the sense that they lead to a decrease of the total free energy . finally , in a later stage of the instability one observes the formation of deep notches , which are similar to cracks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , if solely accounting for linear elasticity , this instability leads to a breakdown of the physical description due to a finite time cusp singularity : after a finite time , the unstable deep grooves advance with infinitely high velocities and vanishing tip radii ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this problem can be solved , for instance , by the inclusion of elastodynamic effects which restore the selection of the steady state tip radius and velocity .",
    "based on this recognition , a minimal continuum theory of fracture was developed using only well - established thermodynamical concepts @xcite . in this picture , a full modeling of a propagating crack not only determines the crack speed but also the entire crack shape and scale self - consistently , which leads to a description as a moving boundary problem .",
    "the latter was then solved by basically two different methods : first , a sharp interface multipole expansion technique @xcite and the fully dynamic phase field method @xcite .",
    "remarkably , already this single parameter minimum model selects steady state propagation velocities appreciably below the rayleigh speed and shows a tip splitting instability for high applied tensions .",
    "a shortcoming of the model is a decaying velocity as function of the driving force over a significant range of applied stresses .",
    "recently , a similar continuum model of fracture was proposed in @xcite , curing the problem of the finite time singularity by viscoelastic damping .",
    "apart from the usual dissipation directly at the crack surface , viscous bulk dissipation takes place in an extended zone around the crack .",
    "hence , the incoming flow of elastic energy is partially converted to surface energy , in order to advance the crack , and thermal energy due to viscous damping . however",
    ", this model does not capture a branching instability for high applied loads in case of mode i loading . the purpose of the present paper is twofold : first , it summarizes and extends the aforementioned work for the limiting cases of pure elastodynamics and viscoelasticity .",
    "second , it introduces a description which contains _ both _ effects , therefore capturing the benefits of them and overcoming the limitations .",
    "we apply the model mainly to mode i , but also mixed mode loadings consisting both of mode i and mode iii .",
    "two different material transport mechanisms are considered and compared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : crack - model ] we present the continuum model of crack propagation in elastodynamic and viscoelastic media .",
    "then , in section [ selection ] , the crack tip selection principles are discussed .",
    "the arising free boundary problems are solved numerically by the use of sharp interface and phase field methods , as presented in section [ methods ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the predictions of the model in section [ resultssec ] .",
    "\\a ) b )    c )    \\d ) e )    f )    we propose a description of fracture in the spirit of elastically driven interfacial pattern formation processes .",
    "in contrast to classical descriptions , where the tip is treated as a singular point followed by a mathematical cut , we assume the crack to be macroscopically extended , and , even more important , to have a finite tip radius @xmath1 , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ atomfig ] , [ geometrysd ] and [ geometrypt ] .",
    "this finite tip size implies , that the volume inside the crack is also finite , and  depending on the growth mechanism of the crack  also a description of this inner `` phase '' is necessary .",
    "the shape of the crack itself is not an input to the model , but is determined self - consistently by the equations of motion for the _ entire _ crack . in this sense , the description differs substantially from classical models , where only equations of motion for the singular crack tip have to be postulated or derived .",
    "one of the advantages of such a description is that the entire crack shape is a degree of freedom for the model , and therefore not only the advance of the crack itself is described , but also deformations of the crack contour behind the tip , and ",
    "what is much more important  path selection is automatically contained in such models @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the crack depend on the local elastic deformations , but also the local curvature of the interface . in this way",
    ", they naturally capture the effect of stress release through crack propagation , but also the increase of interfacial energy due to crack elongation , which is the basis for the griffith criterion .",
    "it turns out that the desired self - consistent selection of the crack shape is a nontrivial step , since by the aforementioned atg instability the tip tends to become sharper and sharper , without a self - consistent selection of a tip scale , if only static linear elasticity and interfacial energy are taken into account .",
    "another important aspect is related to the definition of the crack shape .",
    "we describe all patterns here in the lagrangian reference frame , which means that in this configuration the mechanical deformations are _ not _ taken into account . in this reference frame a straight cut , which is frequently used for a mathematical description of a crack , would just appear as a line , and has a vanishing tip radius . under deformation , however , the crack surfaces separate , in particular the distance between the lips would scale as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance from the crack tip , @xmath4 the mode i stress intensity factor and @xmath5 is the elastic modulus of the material .",
    "pure elasticity describes only the deformation of materials , but it does not provide evolution equations of the motion of the crack .",
    "in particular , _ linear _ elasticity would predict a @xmath6 stress singularity at an infinitely sharp crack tip .",
    "physically , one would expect regularization of this singularity either by nonlinear effects or a finite tip radius @xmath7 , which serves as a cutoff parameter . in this work",
    "we do not follow the first regularization approach and consider only linear mechanical models , which will be linear elastodynamics and a linear ( kelvin ) viscoelastic model ; instead , we consider situations with a finite tip radius .",
    "let us briefly contrast this description with conventional pictures of crack growth on an atomistic level .",
    "in brittle materials , the intuitive interpretation of crack propagation is due to the breaking of bonds at sharp crack tips .",
    "this changes the neighborhood configuration for an atom at the crack tip only in the sense that connections to some of the adjacent atoms is lost , and simultaneously the distances to the other atoms are changed due to elastic deformations .",
    "this breaking of bonds corresponds to the advance of the sharp cut in a continuum model ( see fig .  [ atomfig]a and b ) .",
    "ductile effects leads to the emission of dislocations from the crack tip , and lead to blunting ( see fig .",
    "[ atomfig]c ) .",
    "these plastic events introduce also configurational changes in the bulk in the sense that the neighborhood relations are changed .",
    "we point out , that this is a bulk effect , which of course also reaches the crack , since the dislocation lines have to terminate at surfaces .",
    "notice that on the continuum level such modeling requires either equations of motions for dislocations or  in a coarse grained framework  plasticity models . in this article , we will focus on yet another effect , which is not captured by the above picture , which is due to material rearrangement at surfaces ( see fig .  [ atomfig]d - f ) .",
    "it means , literally speaking , that atoms are removed and attached to the crack surfaces at different places , and therefore the neighborhood configurations are changed now in the sense of a surface effect . for a crack that has a finite tip radius already in the reference frame , advance of the crack",
    "means that atoms have to be removed from the tip .",
    "they can be deposited again on different regions of the crack surface , and in this case we can interpret the material transport as a surface diffusion process .",
    "alternatively , we could imagine that the removed atoms become part of a `` gas phase '' inside the crack .",
    "a gas has of course a lower density than the solid , which would require that ultimately the gas atoms have to be ejected from the crack ( if the density difference is not accommodated by the crack opening ) . for convenience",
    ", we will not consider this fast `` hydrodynamic '' transport and ignore the density difference between the solid and the `` dense gas phase '' .",
    "notice that in both cases of material transport the atoms undergo long - range transport ( on the atomic scale ) , and therefore their neighborhood configuration changes completely .    on the continuum level",
    ", we therefore have to provide equations of motion for each interface point of the crack , reflecting either surface diffusion ( sd ) or the phase transformation ( pt ) mechanism between the solid and the gas phase .",
    "they are coupled to the elastic fields in a nonlocal and nonlinear manner .",
    "the motion is then driven by the tendency to lower the total free energy of the system .",
    "an important and obvious difference is that for sd the number of `` solid '' atoms is conserved , which is not the case for the pt mechanism .    for both transport mechanisms , we consider the growth of a single crack in a strip geometry , in order to have a constant stress intensity factor .",
    "we restrict to an effectively two dimensional system by the assumption of translational invariance in the @xmath8-direction , and assume the strip to be infinitely extended in the direction of propagation , which in our case is chosen to be the @xmath9-direction .",
    "we mainly concentrate on mode i fracture , which means that the applied tensile forces act in the @xmath10-direction perpendicularly to the crack faces . apart from this",
    ", we will also discuss results from the application of mode iii loadings , and linear combinations of these two modes .",
    "since the crack tip is macroscopically extended , no singularity appears and the whole crack pattern can be described consistently in the continuum approximation .    in a lagrangian description of linear elasticity",
    ", the elastic state of the system is described through a continuous displacement field @xmath11 .",
    "then , the strains are defined as the symmetrical spatial derivatives of the displacements , @xmath12 as the total stress field depends linearly on both the strain as well as the strain  rate , we conveniently decompose it into a strain and a strain  rate dependent part , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the elastic and viscous stresses , respectively , and @xmath16 denotes the time derivative of the strain @xmath17 . furthermore , we restrict the considerations to fully isotropic media .",
    "then , as given by hooke s law , the elastic stresses are @xmath18 where @xmath5 is young s modulus and @xmath19 the poisson ratio , and we use the einstein sum convention . by construction , the viscous stresses are formally similar to the elastic stresses @xcite , and we therefore write them for a kelvin viscoelasticity model as @xmath20 with the two viscous constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution of the elastic degrees of freedom within the viscoelastic solid is given by newton s equation of motion , and the elastic displacements @xmath11 have to fulfill @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass density .",
    "this equation ensures locally a force balance between the elastic stress and viscous friction on the left hand side and inertia on the right side .",
    "these equations have to be supplemented by mechanical boundary conditions , which are given below for the two different transport mechanisms .          for crack growth by surface diffusion",
    ", the crack is filled with vacuum , and therefore we impose stress free boundary conditions at the crack contour , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the direction normal to the interface , and @xmath27 is the normal interface velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ geometrysd ] ) . the second term on the left hand side accounts for momentum conservation at the solid  vacuum interface .",
    "we point out , that in the dynamic limit , when the crack propagation velocity @xmath28 is of the order of the materials sound speed , this term becomes important @xcite .",
    "so far , for an arbitrarily given crack shape and known strain history , the mechanical problem is unambiguously determined and can be calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ mod::eq1])([mechanicalboundcond ] ) together with the outer boundary conditions at the borders of the strip , which specify the externally applied loading .",
    "next , we have to formulate an evolution equation for the crack contour .",
    "the motion of the interface is caused by thermodynamically induced mass transport processes , which diminish the total free energy of the system .",
    "the local driving force for crack propagation is given by the chemical potential @xmath29 at the solid vacuum interface @xcite , @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the surface energy per unit area and @xmath32 the surface curvature , which is counted to be positive , if the crack shape is convex ; the atomic volume @xmath33 appears since the chemical potential is defined as free energy per particle .",
    "we point out that the viscous stresses do not appear in the chemical potential , since viscous dissipation is a sole property of the bulk , whereas the chemical potential is needed to describe energy dissipation through the motion of the interface .",
    "furthermore , we note that due to inertial effects , also the kinetic energy density appears in the chemical potential .",
    "counterintuitively , it appears with sign opposite to that of the potential energy ; this can be derived rigorously from variational principles @xcite .    for surface diffusion",
    "the motion of the crack surface is proportional to the divergence of a flux of solid material along the interface .",
    "this flux of material is induced by gradients of the chemical potential .",
    "we express the motion of the interface by the local normal velocity @xmath27 and obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the tangential derivative and the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 has a dimension @xmath37=\\mathrm{m}^{4}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we note that for surface diffusion the amount of solid material is conserved during the crack propagation . a typical steady state crack shape using surface diffusion is shown in fig .  [ geometrysd ] .",
    "one can see that the crack first opens up to a tip diameter @xmath38 , and then closes again due to the condition of material conservation .",
    "we point out that this description of mass transport is not limited to surface diffusion in its literal sense only .",
    "often , many complicated physical processes like plastic bulk flow take place in a small zone around the tip .",
    "assuming that this zone is relatively thin , the mass transport can _ effectively _ be described by surface diffusion , where the detailed information about the process zone is hidden in the diffusion coefficient in the spirit of a lubrication approximation .          here",
    "we discuss crack propagation by means of a phase transformation process , where the solid matrix transforms into a `` broken gas phase '' with vanishing elastic moduli .",
    "we assume that the gas phase and the viscoelastic medium to have equal mass densities @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , the interface between this `` dense gas '' phase and the medium is considered to be coherent , i.e.  the displacements are continuous there . with these assumptions ,",
    "two central simplifications are achieved .",
    "first , instead of eq .",
    "( [ mechanicalboundcond ] ) the mechanical boundary conditions are @xmath39 which means that no velocity dependent correction appears here , since by the continuity of velocities and densities also the momentum is contiuous .",
    "second , the expression for the chemical potential is replaced by @xmath40 where the kinetic energy contribution does not appear .",
    "the reason for this simplification is the continuity of the kinetic energy density , because the above expression of the chemical potential should be more correctly be interpreted as the chemical potential difference between the adjacent phases @xcite .",
    "notice that the inner phase is assumed to be infinitely soft , therefore it has a vanishing elastic energy density .",
    "again , the motion of the interface is locally expressed through the normal velocity , which in this case is direct proportional to the chemical potential difference at the interface , @xmath41 with a kinetic coefficient @xmath42 having the dimension [ d]=m@xmath43s@xmath44 . of course , using this model , the amount of solid material is not conserved during crack propagation . in this sense , our model is strongly related to phase field models of fracture based on a non - conserved order parameter @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference is that the current model is based on well - defined sharp interface equations , and therefore the predictions do not depend on inherently numerical parameters like a phase field interface width . a typical steady state crack shape using phase transformations is shown in fig .  [ geometrypt ] .",
    "in contrast to surface diffusion the crack keeps its opening , and does not close far behind the tip ( in the reference state ) due to the absence of material conservation .",
    "however , although surface diffusion seems to be more adequate for a description of fracture , from a numerical point of view the treatment of eq .",
    "( [ steady : eq3 ] ) is much more time - consuming due to the higher order spatial derivatives , which are not present in eq .",
    "( [ steady : eq2 ] ) . therefore , modeling of fracture as a phase transition process offers numerical advantages .",
    "the self - consistent selection of the crack velocity , the tip radius and even the entire crack shape is a central aspect of the present theory , and will be discussed in more detail in this section .",
    "the bulk equation ( [ bulk ] ) , in combination with equations ( [ mechanicalboundcond])-([steady : eq3 ] ) for the surface diffusion , or equations ( [ mech_bound_cond_pt])-([steady : eq2 ] ) for the phase transformation mechanism , describes the dynamics of the two models . in both cases they lead to a complicated free boundary problem .    before starting to solve the full free boundary problem numerically ,",
    "we first discuss qualitatively the existence of steady state solutions , by the use of scaling arguments . here",
    ", the term steady state describes a non - equilibrium solution , for which the crack is moving with a constant velocity @xmath28 , and in a co - moving frame of reference  following the crack tip with the same steady state velocity @xmath28  the shape is constant in time .",
    "the following scaling arguments are fairly generic and can similarly be applied to both the sd and the pt model and predict the characteristic velocity and tip scale .",
    "we will address the selection problem on different levels : first , we use pure dimensional arguments for potential length- and velocity scales , and we show that only with the additional parameters stemming from viscoelasticity or mass density microscopic tip scales appear , which can select a tip radius .",
    "this argument captures already the essential physical situation , and therefore the following , more extended discussion could be skipped for first reading .",
    "there , we revisit the behavior with a more detailed analysis of the equations of motion ; the basic outcome of this more advanced investigation is that for the purely elastostatic case tip radius and velocity can not be selected inpendently .",
    "we then show how the inclusion of inertial or viscoelastic effects cures this problem .",
    "the simplest assessment is to determine the possible nontrivial parameter combinations in the model in order to form a lengthscale .",
    "for pure linear static elasticity , however , it is not possible to set a microscopic length scale out of the material parameters and the applied load , and therefore selection is not possible in this case .",
    "the lack of such a lengthscale is the reason for the cusp singularity of the atg instability and the impossibility of a steady state crack growth under these conditions .",
    "the situation is different , when inertial effects are taken into account , because then the rayleigh wave speed ( the sounds wave speed at a free surface ) , @xmath45 appears as characteristic velocity scale in the problem .",
    "then we expect the crack velocity to be of this order , @xmath46 , and we can form a microscopic lengthscale by the parameter combinations @xmath47 for sd and @xmath48 for pt , which we expect to be the tip scales in this case . if instead of inertial effects viscous bulk damping becomes relevant , the characteristic velocity scale is @xmath49 for sd and @xmath50 for pt .",
    "consequently , we expect the characteristic tip scales @xmath51 for sd and @xmath52 .    for a more detailed analysis",
    ", we have to inspect the fields and the equations of motion .",
    "we first return to the case without viscous or inertial effects .",
    "we note that the stresses on the boundary of the crack tip with finite radius @xmath53 scale as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the stress intensity factor . since this analysis can be applied both to mode i and mode iii , we do not indicate the loading conditions in the stress intensity factor . also , by boundary conditions the normal and shear stresses on the crack surfaces vanish ( or are small , if the momentum transfer term is included for surface diffusion , provided that the crack speed is substantially smaller than the speed of sound ) .",
    "therefore , the only nontrivial stress component is the tangential stress , which depends on the shape of the entire crack .",
    "although the stress scaling ( [ sqrt_decay_stresses ] ) appears to be natural in the framework of fracture mechanics , it is not trivial , and therefore we discuss it in more detail .",
    "since we intend to describe cracks with a finite tip radius , the stress field typically contains not only @xmath56 terms but also faster diverging terms @xmath57 .",
    "these terms can not be present for sharp crack tips , since they would lead to a diverging elastic energy , but can not be excluded for finite @xmath7 , since then the divergency is cut off .",
    "therefore , the stress field typically consists of singular and regular parts @xmath58 in a polar representation . for the sake of brevity we do not write the angular dependence @xmath59 explicitly .",
    "the regular part of the stress @xmath60 contains only constant contribution ( `` @xmath61 stress '' ) and positive powers of @xmath3 . in the region @xmath62 ,",
    "i.e.  close to the ( small ) crack tip on the scale of the system size @xmath63 , the ascending powers can however be ignored .",
    "also , the t stress scales as @xmath64 , and therefore vanishes for large system sizes and given stress intensity factor @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , @xmath65 for the further discussion .",
    "the above representation is the heart for the multipole expansion method that will be introduced below in section [ mem ] .",
    "notice that the higher order modes seem to violate the anticipated @xmath66 scaling of eq .",
    "( [ sqrt_decay_stresses ] ) .",
    "to understand this situation , we inspect a crack with a different tip radius , which we obtain by a geometrical rescaling @xmath67 , and with the same stress intensity factor .",
    "we make the scaling ansatz for the stresses @xmath68 for this rescaled geometry as @xmath69 in relation to the original problem . at large distances from the tip , the main mode @xmath70 prevails , hence @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "both cracks look identical on large distances , where they become sharp straight cracks , and therefore @xmath72 . on the crack surface , where also the higher modes are relevant",
    ", the stress of the rescaled problem is therefore @xmath73 .",
    "hence , for a crack with a four times sharper tip , the surface stresses are two times higher , as stated in eq .",
    "( [ sqrt_decay_stresses ] ) .",
    "obviously , the interface curvature in the tip region scales as @xmath74 .",
    "hence , as long as only _",
    "static linear elasticity _ is taken into account , all contributions to the chemical potential scale as @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , a rescaling of the equations of motion ( [ steady : eq3 ] ) or ( [ steady : eq2 ] ) is possible : formally , the equations of motion depend only on the dimensionless combinations @xmath76 for the sd mechanism and @xmath77 for the pt dynamics .",
    "all other parameters combine to the dimensionless driving force @xmath78 ( in case of pure mode i loading ) , where @xmath79 corresponds to the griffith point . in other words ,",
    "the radius @xmath53 and the steady state velocity @xmath28 can not be selected separately within the framework of the pure static theory of elasticity .",
    "even if a steady state solution exists , it would still degenerate to a one - parameter family of solutions with either fast cracks with small tip radii or slow cracks with large tip scales .",
    "it turns out , however , that no steady state solutions exist , which is exactly the aforementioned cusp singularity of the atg instability .    additionally to this inspection of the behavior in the tip region",
    ", we can get more insights from the analysis of the crack shapes in the tail region , where the elastic stresses have decayed . to that end we assume that the crack is growing in the steady state regime in positive @xmath9-direction with a constant velocity @xmath28 . for the sd model , the shape equation ( [ steady : eq3 ] )",
    "can be integrated once , and in the co - moving frame of reference we obtain @xmath80 this is a complicated , non - linear third order equation with non - local contributions arising from the elastic fields , since @xmath81 depends on the entire shape . in the tail region the shape equation is simplified to the third order differential equation @xmath82 due to the decay of the stress fields , which has two growing and one decaying solution . only the latter @xmath83 asymptotically describes the physically allowed shape .",
    "we switch to a polar coordinate system @xmath84 for the tip region , and focus on symmetrical solutions , @xmath85 .",
    "since the physical properties , curvature and stresses , do not depend on the choice of the coordinate system but only on the crack shape , we can arbitrarily chose @xmath86 , with the a priori unknown tip radius @xmath87 . then from symmetry considerations and the definition of the tip curvature , @xmath88",
    ", the natural conditions @xmath89 arise .",
    "integration over the upper interface @xmath90 requires the suppression of the two growing exponentials at the tail , which imposes two boundary conditions . for a given external loading",
    ", these two conditions can be fulfilled by a proper selection of the tip radius @xmath53 and growth velocity @xmath28 . however , since the use of only linear static theory of elasticity does not allow the independent selection of both the tip radius @xmath53 and the steady state velocity @xmath28 , the selection will not suppress both growing exponentials at the same time , and consequently a crack like solution does not exist @xcite .    for the pt model , a similar argument can be given @xcite . in the tail region , where the elastic stresses have decayed , the shape equation becomes simply @xmath91 .",
    "its general solution , @xmath92 , contains the finite crack opening @xmath93 and a growing exponential .",
    "notice , that in contrast to the surface diffusion process a finite opening @xmath38 can not be excluded since we do not have to obey mass conservation here . suppressing the exponential and selecting a finite",
    "tail opening @xmath93 finally requires again the independent selection of both the steady state propagation velocity and the crack tip radius .",
    "consequently , a steady state solution for a growing crack in the framework of the static theory of elasticity does not exist .",
    "the situation changes if additional length scales enter into the description , and two natural aforementioned extensions for a description of crack growth are viscous bulk dissipation and dynamic elasticity .",
    "nonlinear elastic or plastic effects are also conceivable , but are beyond the scope of the present article @xcite . although the viscous stress defined in eq .",
    "( [ viscousstresses ] ) introduces two new parameters , the timescales , which are introduced by them , should typically be of the same order . by setting @xmath94",
    "we restrict to the case of only one additional time scale @xmath95 to simplify the situation .",
    "then , considering static elasticity and viscous bulk dissipation , additionally the dimensionless ratio @xmath96 with @xmath97 for pt and @xmath98 for sd appears in the equations of motion , and therefore a rescaling is no longer possible .",
    "then this additional free parameter allows to independently select both the tip scale @xmath53 and the steady state velocity @xmath28 , so that the two growing exponentials can be suppressed .    to make this more explicit",
    ", we note that by virtue of eqs .",
    "( [ hookelaw ] ) and ( [ viscousstresses ] ) for steady state growth @xmath99 . therefore , as consequence of the force balance condition ( [ bulk ] ) we get a correction to the elastic stresses which depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath100 . for sd , in the interface evolution equation",
    "the two non - dimensional parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 appear , which contain different combinations of the tip radius and the crack velocity , hence these two nonlinear eigenvalues can be selected independently to suppress the two growing exponential terms in the tail region . since @xmath103 and @xmath104 are of order unity for driving forces of order one , we therefore get @xmath105 , hence @xmath106 , which is the predicted velocity scale @xmath107 .",
    "analogous arguments can be used for the pt mechanism .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath108 if inertial effects are relevant , and the microscopic tip scales are @xmath109 for sd and @xmath110 for pt @xcite .    altogether , we conclude that independent of the considered mass transport mechanism , steady state growth of cracks is possible if apart from static elasticity at least one additional effect is taken into account .",
    "furthermore , for both mechanisms a tip splitting is at least conceivable for high applied tensions due to a secondary atg instability : since @xmath111 in the tip region and the local atg length is @xmath112 , an instability may occur , provided that the tip radius reaches by blunting the order of the atg length .",

    "we will give a detailed comparison between the model behaviors .",
    "the free boundary problem , which arises from the coupling of non - local dynamic elasticity or viscoelasticity to the interface kinetics , is studied by the use of two complementary methods , which are presented in this section .",

    "situations where both effects play a role can only be treated in a perturbative manner .    as second method",
    "we use a fully dynamic phase field model with a sharp interface limit corresponding to our model equations .",
    "in contrast to the multipole expansion method the phase field approach allows also to investigate transient behaviors and crack branching , and also enables to model both elastodynamic and viscoelastic effects in a uniform framework .",
    "however , obtaining quantitative results comparable with those by the multipole expansion method is computationally very expensive .      for solution of the steady state problem of crack propagation with the multipole expansion method we divide the problem into two parts : first , the solution of the mechanical problem for an arbitrary , but known crack shape and velocity @xmath28 , and second the evolution of the crack contour and adjustment of the velocity .",

    "the subsequent technical subsections for the determination of the eigenmodes for these two cases can be skipped for the first reading . for mode iii loading , which is mathematically simpler , similar approaches can be found ; in particular , the solution of the viscoelastic mode iii problem is presented in @xcite .",

    "we therefore suggest an approximative model , which captures essential physical aspects and gives exact results both in the limit of vanishing viscous damping and treats viscous damping in the sense of a rigorous perturbation theory for low velocities .    to motivate the model",
    "let us first consider the case of static elasticity , where inertial effects can be neglected .",
    "thus , we solve the elastic problem consisting of three ingredients , i.e.  bulk equilibrium @xmath229 , stress free boundaries at the crack surfaces , @xmath230 and @xmath231 at large distances , and additionally compatibility , which means that the strain tensor , which is related to the stress via hooke s law , can be derived from a displacement field .",
    "we use here the superscript @xmath232 to indicate that we are dealing here with a purely elastic field , which is later used as zeroth order for a perturbative treatment . by these requirements the solution for @xmath233 is formally uniquely defined ( apart from translational and rotational degrees of freedom ) .    on the other hand , for the viscoelastic steady state problem the total stress consists additively of the elastic and viscous stress , @xmath234 , where the viscous stress is related to the elastic stress by @xmath235 ( we assume here again that we have only one viscoelastic timescale and that the crack moves in positive @xmath9 direction ) . now",

    "however , this concept can not strictly be extended to the case of dynamical elasticity , since there on the right hand side of the newtonian equation the acceleration term @xmath252 contains only _ elastic _ displacements ( so even in the force balance equation for the _ total _ stress the right hand side contains the _ elastic _",
    "accelerations ) , and therefore the purely _ elastodynamic _ and the _ total viscoelastodynamic _ stresses do not obey the same equations .",
    "instead , we use the above recipe ( [ toy_model_idea ] ) to incorporate viscous damping in the chemical potential also with inertial effects , and consider this as an approximative viscoelastodynamic model ; of course , this model is not rigorously derived , but captures essential aspects of the physics and is still exact for @xmath119 and becomes a rigorous perturbation theory for @xmath253 .",

    "alternative descriptions , which are intended to investigate the influence of elastic stresses on the morphological deformation of surfaces due to phase transition processes , are based on macroscopic equations of motion .",
    "but they suffer from inherent finite time singularities which do not allow steady state crack growth unless the tip radius is again limited by the phase field interface width @xcite .",

    ", we found in particular evidence for the remarkable prediction that the steady state velocity decays weakly with increasing driving force @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the product @xmath345 , which controls the dissipation , is still growing monotonically .",
    "this counterintuitive outcome means that within the dynamic limit ( @xmath297 ) of the model the dissipation is mainly increased due to tip blunting instead of a rise of the crack speed .",
    "tip blunting then always leads to a tip branching instability for higher driving forces , due to a secondary atg - instability as mentioned in section [ selection ] . in the multipole expansion method , which captures only steady state solutions , this transition towards unstable crack growth",
    "is reflected by a change of sign of the tip curvature at @xmath346 , which is in agreement with the critical driving force for the branching instability in phase field modeling . in fig .",
    "[ velocitycomparison ] we indicate this change by a change from the black to the gray line - color , and in the inset we show two corresponding crack shapes . for further details we refer to @xcite .",
    "although the model provides a selection of the crack tip scale and velocity in the limit of vanishing dissipation , it suffers from the fact that for the small range of driving forces near the griffith point the velocity of the crack is finite while the size of the crack tip approaches zero .",
    "more precisely , the velocity branch in fig .",
    "[ velocitycomparison ] terminates at @xmath347 with a finite velocity , and below this value no steady state solutions are found .",
    "thus , the solution branch does not naturally connect to the griffith point @xmath79 . here",
    ", another tip scale mechanism would be necessary , in order to restore selection . in the phase field method",
    "( without performing the extrapolation to the sharp interface limit @xmath338 ) the interface thickness serves here as numerical tip scale selection mechanism @xcite . in the same way , setting the minimal allowed opening by hand , also the situation for the multipole expansion method can be improved @xcite . however , since our intention was to formulate a continuum model of fracture which is independent of any microscopic length scales , for the present purpose , such introduction of a finite cutoff length scale is unsatisfactory .",
    "then , on the other hand , the sudden velocity jump and the subsequent decay with increasing driving force are unavoidable outcomes and seem to disagree with intuitive expectations .",
    "this , together with the fact , that in the inertial limit no steady state solutions exist for sd , has been a major motivation for considering viscoelastic bulk dissipation as an alternative selection mechanism .",
    "we point out that the selection of tip velocity and radius via viscous bulk dissipation as discussed in the previous subsection neither suffers from the problem of finite velocities slightly above the griffith point nor requires the introduction of an additional microscopic cutoff length scale . on the other hand , for mode i the tip branching instability does not occur without inertial effects .",
    "therefore , to describe the full picture of crack propagation under mode i loading , it is highly desirable to account for both viscous dissipation as well as dynamic effects , as will be discussed in the next subsection .      the rigorous treatment of the regime where both inertial and viscoelastic effects are relevant has been performed with the phase field model , and additionally an approximative description with the multipole expansion method is possible .",
    "the model , which has been introduced in section [ toy_model ] , has the advantage that it is exact without viscous damping in the inertial regime , @xmath297 , and it is a rigorous perturbation expansion for slow cracks , @xmath348 , using the viscosity @xmath349 as small expansion parameter , where @xmath93 is the crack tip scale , hence operating in the regime of large values of @xmath350 .",
    "therefore , this model allows to gain qualitative insights into the full problem of dynamic mode i crack propagation including viscous bulk friction , both for the pt mechanism and sd .",
    "we start the discussion of the results again for the sd model , and the results are all obtained by the multipole expansion method . as mentioned above , no physically reasonable steady state solutions exist in the purely inertial limit , @xmath297 , and we will return to this point below .",

    ", the velocity decreases with the increase of the viscosity strength @xmath358 . at the same time , the bifurcation point , beyond which no steady state solutions exist , is shifted to higher driving forces .",
    "this fact indicates that viscous damping suppresses crack branching , in agreement with the earlier observation that it does not occur in the purely viscous limit .",
    "for very strong viscous damping , @xmath350 , the velocity becomes small and is then set by the viscous speed scale @xmath355 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ mode1_visco_sd ] , where it is a purely monotonically growing function of the driving force .",

    "however , in the framework of the present model it becomes thereby understandable why no `` reasonable '' solutions exist in the elastodynamic limit .",

    "the reason for the agreement of these apparent griffith points is that for @xmath361 the chemical potential is basically zero along the crack , both for sd and pt ; also , below this value of the driving force the behavior is dictated by bulk dissipation , and therefore the transport mechanism on the crack surfaces plays only a minor role .",
    "from the apparent griffith point on the velocities increase monotonically quite rapidly up to a maximal value . then the velocity maximum",

    "crack branching is expected beyond the bifurcation point . with increasing viscosity strength @xmath351 the driving force of maximal velocity as well as the point where the curvature turns negative are both shifted to higher driving forces .",
    "this supports the conclusion that dynamic effects favor of the occurrence the tip splitting instability , or ",
    "vice versa  the presence of viscous bulk friction helps to stabilize the crack against the tip splitting instability , which is also qualitatively supported by fully dynamic phase field simulations .",

    "the pt and sd model have in common that the crack velocity decreases with the increase of viscosity strength @xmath351 , while the turning point is shifted to higher driving forces .",

    "the gray line belongs to steady state solutions with negative tip curvature . ]    at @xmath372 the size of the mode iii steady state crack diverges and @xmath373 . the viscous dissipation becomes negligible here , but the surface dissipation remains finite .",
    "this point can be interpreted as the point of ductile - to - brittle transition : below it the size grows indefinitely in time and the crack slows down , while above this point steady state solutions with a finite tip scale exist .    starting from a pure mode iii crack , we can now include additional mode i loadings .",
    "[ mixedmodevelocitiessd ] shows that this shifts the bifurcation point towards higher values and therefore extends the range of steady state solutions towards higher driving forces . from this",
    "we can conclude that mode iii contributions favor the appearance of the tip splitting instability .",
    "in contrast , the preceding results suggets that inertial effects should push the onset of branching back towards lower driving forces . it is important to note that mode i and mode iii have a different behavior , which is due to the behavior of the stresses on the crack surfaces .",
    "we focus here on the elastic fields far away from the tip , and in this region the behavior is purely elastic . without inertial effects ,",
    "normal and shear stresses vanish on the crack surfaces , and therefore it is the tangential stress component which determines the elastic contribution to the chemical potential . from the singular contributions to the stress",
    "@xcite one obtains on the crack lips elastic chemical potential contributions @xmath374 for mode iii and @xmath375 for mode i. this weaker decay of the singular fields for mode iii also influences the crack shapes .",
    "let us look at the asymptotic shape @xmath376 of a crack in the sd model ( in the tail region @xmath377 ) , and focus on polynomial terms . as discussed in @xcite exponential terms",
    "are very important for the selection of the crack velocity and tip scale , which is related to the supression of _ growing _ exponentials in the tail region .",
    "remaining exponentially decaying terms are small in comparison to the power law terms in the asymptotic regime , and therefore we suppress them here . by the steady state equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ steady : eq1 ] ) and ( [ steady : eq3 ] ) we obtain @xmath378 for mode iii .",
    "therefore , we obtain a scaling behavior for surface diffusion as @xmath379 .",
    "correspondingly , in the case of pure mode i loading for sd the shape function decays like @xmath380 , which is substantially faster .    in the case of the pt model",
    "this effect is more pronounced . since the amount of `` material '' inside the crack is not conserved",
    ", it is reasonable to look for shape functions @xmath381 , again with purely polynomial functions @xmath382 . neglecting the second derivative @xmath383 from the curvature contribution to the chemical potential",
    ", we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ chemical_pot_pt ] ) and ( [ steady : eq2 ] ) in the co - moving frame of reference the following ordinary differential equation in the asymptotic regime : @xmath384 .",
    "hence , in the case of a finite mode iii contribution the shape function does not even decay but instead weakly grows like @xmath385 .",
    "this slow opening of the crack becomes negligible for higher crack speeds .",
    "this weak logarithmic growth of the asymptotic crack shape is also confirmed by the multipole expansion method simulations as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ mode3_visco ] in the case of @xmath386 mode iii contribution .     as a function of driving force @xmath286 for @xmath386 mode iii loading in the case of the pt model .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the results of the multipole expansion method in the viscous limit .",
    "the symbols correspond to the phase field results with a viscosity strength @xmath319 . for the phase field , we used @xmath387 and @xmath388 ; the size of the system in grid points is @xmath285 .",
    "the inset shows the multipole expansion method steady state crack shape for a total driving force of @xmath389 .",
    "both directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are scaled with the half tail - opening @xmath93 of the crack . ]    for the phase field simulations , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ mode3_visco ] for @xmath390 and @xmath319 , we find a remarkably good agreement with the sharp interface results over the whole range of driving forces . with the phase field method ,",
    "we observe two different kinds of growth : slightly above the griffith point up to a driving force of about @xmath391 , we obtain solutions with almost zero velocity and an asymptotically growing crack opening similar to what the shape from the multipole expansion method shows . then above this point the solutions",
    "seem to regularize , and this weak growth of the shape function is no longer observable using the phase field method , probably due to the higher growth velocity . for pure mode iii loading this transition point is shifted to an even higher driving force of about @xmath392 , as we analyzed by means of phase field simulations .",
    "we point out that these shape peculiarities can also be interpreted from the more general argument that no stationary shapes exist in mode iii if only elastic effects are taken into account . for this loading mode the only two nonvanishing stress components @xmath393 and @xmath394",
    "can be expressed as real and imaginary part of an analytic function .",
    "an equilibrium solution would require a vanishing chemical potential along the entire crack shape , which in turn demands that the aforementioned analytic function is zero there , since the elastic part is quadratic in both stress components .",
    "if an analytical function is zero along a line segment , it must vanish everywhere ; this , however , is not compatible with a nontrivial remote stress field .",
    "we have presented a continuum description of fracture in the spirit of elastically driven interfacial pattern formation processes .",
    "this description leads to moving boundary problems , where not only the propagation velocity but also the entire shape , and especially the tip radius , have to be selected self - consistently . in particular , we have discussed two different mechanisms of crack propagation : in the first case the crack is considered to advance by material diffusion along the crack surface .",
    "secondly , we interpret fracture as a first order phase transformation process of the solid material to a `` dense gas '' phase .",
    "scaling arguments were given that  to cure the finite time cusp singularity of the atg instability ",
    "one necessarily needs an independent selection of the tip radius and the steady state velocity , which is not possible if solely static linear elasticity is taken into account .",
    "therefore , apart from capillarity and linear elasticity , additional physical effects are required for the determination of additional length and time scales . since we focus on gaining fundamental insights into the phenomenon of fracture , we have concentrated here only on well established theoretical concepts for dynamic elasticity and viscous dissipation .",
    "the arising moving boundary problems have been solved by two complementary methods .",
    "first , we have developed an efficient steady state sharp interface method based on the expansion of the mechanical state in eigenfunctions of a straight mathematical cut .",
    "second , a fully dynamic phase field description of crack propagation by first order phase transformation processes has been developed .    with these numerical tools at hand ,",
    "we have obtained profound insights into the model behavior of our continuum description of fracture . in particular , we have extensively discussed mode i fracture , where the coupled influence of dynamic elasticity and viscous dissipation leads to a model behavior which reproduces three important generic features of fracture : ( i ) the saturation of steady state velocities appreciably below the rayleigh speed , ( ii ) parameter regimes , where the steady state velocity increases with increasing driving force , and ( iii ) a crack branching instability for high applied tensions . apart from this also mixtures of mode",
    "i and mode iii loadings have been discussed , and we have found in particular a different behavior of the crack shapes , as well as a change of the branching behavior .",
    "the main results are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the future challenge is to combine the ideas , approaches and results from this work to `` conventional '' fracture models , to address the question of the relevance of the different physical mechanisms . from a thermodynamical point of view , there is a driving force for elastically induced phase transformations , which leads to the fracture models presented here .",
    "however , it has to be addressed to which extend , and under which environmental conditions , these processes can be understood as dominant mechanisms for crack propagation , i.e.  for instance the diffusion along crack surfaces can be an efficient mechanism in comparison to the pure bond breaking .",
    "we note , that due to the small tip scales the material transport is necessary only on very short distances , and therefore a mechanism like surface diffusion , which is usually assumed to be slow , can still lead to fast crack propagation . here",
    "it should be pointed out that on such small scales a pure continuum description may not be quantitatively accurate , but can still capture the essential physical mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental investigations of fracture in brittle gels possibly reveal macroscopic scales @xcite .",
    "in general , the question concerning energy barriers should play a central role and should shed light on the relevance of the different mechanisms .",
    "we expect that material transport should become relevant at elevated temperatures . in the conventional picture for brittle materials",
    "a few bonds per atom have to be broken to advance the crack by one lattice unit , and this event takes place very localized at the ( sharp ) tip .",
    "the energetic cost for such an `` event '' is on the order of @xmath395 .",
    "in contrast , for the `` material transport picture '' the overall energetic expense is the same ( since the same amount of new interfaces is created ) , but a change of the bonding situation is required for several atoms .",
    "however , since the diffusing atoms do not have to be completely detached from the surfaces , energetically efficient low - barrier paths may exist for the motion to the next lattice site , and therefore the effective diffusion constant can be relatively high . furthermore , surface reactions , as a recently predicted amorphization of diamond , can lead to a bond weakening and material softening of even very brittle materials within short times @xcite and could facilitate even higher transport rates .",
    "we notice that in some cases nonlinear elastic corrections may play an important role @xcite and even lead to a high - speed oscillatory instability @xcite . for more ductile materials ,",
    "plastic processes due to dislocation emission are important , and they have not yet been taken into account .",
    "we expect bulk dissipation through plasticity to play a similar role as viscous damping , as has been demonstrated above .",
    "apart from that , these theories introduce the concept of a yield stress @xmath396 , which is a natural cutoff for the stress singularity .",
    "therefore , from point of view of crack tip selection , one can expect the radius @xmath7 to be determined by this cutoff , i.e.  @xmath397 . since this leads to strong blunting ,",
    "surface diffusion is probably not efficient for high driving forces , and in fact the contribution of surface diffusion to the propagation velocity would be a decaying function of the driving force , hence only for small @xmath286 it may compete with a bond - breaking mechanism together with plastic flow .",
    "another aspect is that plastic effects lead to large deformations , and therefore from a technical point of view it would then be desirable to describe the material transport processes in the _ deformed _ system , which suggests the use of a eulerian rather than a lagrangian description .",
