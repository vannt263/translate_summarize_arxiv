    "the ubiquity of this exponential form actually comes @xcite from the exponential tail of the gumbel distribution which represents one universality classes of extreme - value statistics @xcite .",
    "the exponential density of energy ( [ rhoe ] ) corresponds for the arrhenius trapping time @xmath6 to the algebraic law @xmath7 with the temperature - dependent exponent @xmath8 at low temperatures @xmath9 , the mean trapping time @xmath10 is infinite and this directly leads to aging effects .",
    "this mechanism shows that the presence of broad distribution of trapping times ( [ qtau ] ) is rather generic at low temperatures , since it simply emerges from the exponential tail of extreme - value statistics for the energy barriers .",

    "it is thus interesting to consider this question from the rsrg perspective .",
    "the arguments presented in details above for the special form ( [ ratew ] ) of the rates may be straightforwardly generalized as follows . the trapping time associated to a trap @xmath259 with energy @xmath257 existing in the renormalized landscape ( [ taue ] ) is more generally given by @xmath308 whereas the trapping time of the vicinity of this renormalized trap ( [ tauetoile ] ) reads more generally @xmath309 the detailed balance condition ( [ detailed ] ) for the special case @xmath310 and @xmath311 thus gives @xmath312 so the condition to have exactly the same properties on large scales as in the usual trap model ( [ ratew ] ) with @xmath17 , is simply @xmath313 since this condition is sufficient to get @xmath314 . in this case , the only observable sensitive to the precise form of the rates will be again the probability @xmath298 to remain exactly on the same site between @xmath35 and @xmath299 . indeed , this probability will be a scaling function of the ratio @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is the cut - off @xmath317 of the renormalized landscape at time @xmath35 , i.e. at scale @xmath205 ( [ roft ] ) . in terms of the energy cut - off @xmath318 ( [ defofgammat ] ) @xmath319 we thus obtain ( [ tauegen ] ) the general prediction @xmath320 vice versa ,",
    "if one is interested into constructing a model with a given decay time decay time @xcite @xmath316 for the function @xmath298 , it is sufficient to choose a form for the rates that satisfies the following asymptotic behavior @xmath321 in particular , to obtain the ultra - slow logarithmic aging dynamics @xmath322 , the jump rates have to behave as the power law @xmath323 for @xmath324 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "since the random walk on a square lattice in dimension @xmath4 is recurrent , we expect that here also , the scale of  escape times \" in the renormalized landscape will be different from the scale of trapping times . on the contrary , for @xmath325 ,",
    "the random walk is not recurrent , and there will be only one time scale given by the trappings times .      as before ,",
    "we define the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath82 as follows : all traps with trapping time @xmath83 are decimated and replaced by a `` flat landscape '' , whereas all traps with waiting time @xmath84 remain unchanged .",
    "we now consider the probability @xmath326 that the renormalized trap closest to the origin is at a distance @xmath85 from the origin . at large scale",
    ", this means that the disc of surface @xmath327 is empty of renormalized traps , whereas the disc of radius @xmath328 is not , yielding @xmath329 that generalizes ( [ length],[plambda ] ) .",
    "given a renormalized trap @xmath93 , @xmath326 also describes the distribution of the distance @xmath85 of the nearest neighbor renormalized trap .",
    "we thus define the escape from a renormalized trap @xmath93 as the event where a particle starting at @xmath93 reaches for the first time the circle of distance @xmath85 of the nearest renormalized trap : of course , contrary to the one - dimensional case , this does not mean that the particle has been really absorbed , but we expect that the particle has then a finite probability to be absorbed by a renormalized trap different from @xmath93 .    the probability to escape to the distance @xmath85 without returning to @xmath93 when starting nearby behaves as @xmath330 , where @xmath331 is a constant ( see appendix [ appexcursionsd2 ] for more details ) , and thus the number @xmath106 of sojourns at @xmath93 before the particle succeeds to escape scales as @xmath332 so the time spent inside the trap @xmath93 before the escape scales as @xmath333    the mean time @xmath334 of one unsuccessful excursion scales as ( see appendix [ appexcursionsd2 ] for more details ) @xmath335 so that the total time @xmath135 during the unsuccessful excursions scales before the escape scales as @xmath336 it is thus negligible with respect to @xmath119 ( [ tind2 ] ) at large scale .",
    "finally , the time @xmath138 of the successful excursion over the length @xmath85 scales as @xmath337 and is thus also negligible with respect to @xmath119 ( [ tind2 ] ) at large scale .    in conclusion , the total time needed to escape from a trap @xmath93 of the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath82 @xmath338",
    "is dominated by @xmath119 alone at large scale , and thus we may associate to the trap @xmath93 an escape time @xmath339 where @xmath114 is a random variable of order 1 that characterizes the geometry of the neighboring renormalized traps around @xmath93 .      the distribution of the escape time @xmath1 ( [ escaped2 ] ) in the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath82 will thus present the scaling form @xmath340 so the renormalization scale @xmath82 has to be chosen as a function of time with the scaling @xmath341 i.e. by inversion at leading order @xmath342    so the recurrence properties of the random walk in @xmath4 induces again a different scaling for trapping times and escape times in the renormalized landscape . as a consequence ,",

    ", the number @xmath353 of important traps contained in the disk of radius @xmath352 will not remain finite but will grow logarithmically in time @xmath354 this is in agreement with the absence of localization in @xmath4 as @xmath355 @xcite .",
    "however , in the regime where @xmath355 and @xmath51 with @xmath356 fixed ( [ numbertraps ] ) , we expect that the diffusion front in a given sample may be described as a sum of delta peaks that are out of equilibrium with respect to each other , i.e. that their weights depend on the geometry of the renormalized traps in the region around the origin but not on their energies .",
    "it would be of course very interesting to build some rsrg effective dynamics for @xmath4 case in this regime , but this goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have studied in details the properties of the one - dimensional trap model via a disorder - dependent real - space renormalization procedure .",
    "the rsrg approach provides the correct exponents for the relevant length scale and the two relevant time scales in the full domain @xmath49 , and then allows to compute scaling functions in a systematic series expansion in @xmath56 . since we have already summarized our main results for disorder averages of observables in the introduction [ mainres ]",
    ", we will not describe them again but instead discuss the physical meaning of our construction .",
    "we have seen that at lowest order in @xmath56 , in a given sample , the particle can be only on two sites , which are the two nearest renormalized traps @xmath171 and @xmath172 existing at rg scale @xmath53 , and that the weights of these traps are simply given by the probabilities to reach one before the other one .",
    "this means that the dynamics remains out of equilibrium forever : the weights are not given by boltzmann factors , they do nt even depend on the energies of these two traps , but they only depend on the ratio of the distances to the origin ! when including the first corrections in @xmath56 to this picture , we have taken into account the biggest trap @xmath220 in the interval @xmath225m_-,m_+[$ ] , and the next renormalized traps @xmath357 and @xmath175 , but the dynamics still remains out - of equilibrium since the weights are still determined by the lengths between these traps and by escape rates of the form @xmath358",
    ". this out - of - equilibrium character will thus persist in the whole localized phase @xmath359 where these deep traps keep finite weights .",
    "this explains why the numerical studies @xcite have found that the ideas of  partial equilibrium \" and  effective temperature \" were not able to capture the long - time properties of the trap model .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the directed trap model or in the related biased sinai diffusion , where the thermal packet is also broken into sub - packets that remain out - of - equilibrium with each other even in the infinite time limit @xcite ; this is in contrast with the unbiased sinai diffusion , where the thermal packet is asymptotically localized in one single infinite valley @xcite , in which particles are at equilibrium which each other @xcite .    from the point of view of numerical simulations on random walks in random media , this shows that to study the localization and the convergence or not to a quasi - equilibrium regime at long times , it is interesting to study the dynamics in a single disordered sample , and not only disorder - averaged quantities : for instance , the pictures of a thermal packet in a given sample obtained in @xcite for the sinai diffusion , and in @xcite for the directed trap model , seems to give the clearer insight into the question of localization in one valley or in typically a few traps with finite weights .",
    "and whenever the structure of the thermal packet consists in a few sub - packets , whose positions and weights are sample - dependent , it is a very strong indication that some appropriate real - space rg description can be constructed to study the dynamics .    in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we will show how the present rsrg approach for the unbiased trap model can be generalized to obtain explicit results in the limit @xmath51 for the linear and non - linear response to an external bias , when it is applied from the very beginning at @xmath360 or after a waiting time @xmath35 .",
