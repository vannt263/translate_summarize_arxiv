    "this note is about two classical problems in nonparametric statistical analysis of recurrent event data , both formalised within the framework of a simple , stationary renewal process .",
    "we first consider observation around a fixed time point , i.e. , we observe a backward recurrence time @xmath0 and a forward recurrence time @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the gap - time distribution is the cox - vardi estimator ( cox 1969 , vardi 1985 ) derived from the length - biased distribution of the gap time @xmath2 . however , winter & fldes ( 1988 ) proposed to use a product - limit estimator based on @xmath1 , with delayed entry given by @xmath0 .",
    "keiding & gill ( 1988 ) clarified the relation of that estimator to the standard left truncation problem .",
    "unfortunately this discussion was omitted from the published version ( keiding & gill , 1990 ) .",
    "since these simple relationships do not seem to be on record elsewhere , we offer them here .",
    "the second observation scheme considers a stationary renewal process observed in a finite interval where the left endpoint does not necessarily correspond to an event .",
    "the full likelihood function is complicated , and we briefly survey possibilities for restricting attention to various partial likelihoods , in the nonparametric case again allowing the use of simple product - limit estimators .",
    "winter & fldes ( 1988 ) studied the following estimation problem . consider @xmath3 independent renewal processes in equilibrium with underlying distribution function @xmath4 , which we shall assume absolutely continuous with density @xmath5 , minimal support interval @xmath6 , and hazard @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the reason for our unconventional choice @xmath9 for the hazard rate belonging to @xmath4 will become apparent later . corresponding to a fixed time ,",
    "say @xmath10 , the backward and forward recurrence times @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , are observed ; their sums @xmath14 are length - biased observations from @xmath4 , i.e. , their density is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote a generic triple @xmath17 .",
    "we quote the following distribution results : let @xmath18 be the expectation value corresponding to the the distribution @xmath4 , @xmath19 then the joint distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 has density @xmath20 , the marginal distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equal with _ density _ @xmath21 , and",
    "the marginal distribution of @xmath22 has density @xmath23 , the length - biased density corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "winter and fldes considered the product - limit estimator @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the _ number at risk _ at time @xmath26 .",
    "this estimator is the same as the kaplan - meier estimator for iid survival data @xmath27 left - truncated at @xmath28 ( kaplan & meier 1958 , andersen et al .",
    "winter & fldes showed that @xmath29 is strongly consistent for the _ underlying _ survival function @xmath30 .",
    "we shall show how the derivation of this estimator follows from a simple markov process model similar to the one used by keiding & gill ( 1990 ) to study the random truncation model .",
    "first notice that the conditional distribution of @xmath22 given that @xmath31 has density @xmath32 that is , intensity ( hazard ) @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which is just the hazard @xmath35 corresponding to the underlying distribution @xmath4 left - truncated at @xmath36 .",
    "now define corresponding to @xmath16 a stochastic process @xmath37 on @xmath38 $ ] with state space @xmath39 by @xmath40 note that it takes in successsion the values @xmath10 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hazard rate of the marginal distribution of @xmath0 . for @xmath46 ( and hence @xmath47 ) @xmath48 by the above result on the conditional hazard of @xmath2 given @xmath0 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath49 other transitions are impossible .",
    "that these conditional probabilities depend on @xmath50 and @xmath26 only , but not on @xmath51 , @xmath52 , proves that @xmath37 is a markov process with intensities @xmath53 ( the marginal hazard of @xmath0 , equal to the residual mean lifetime function of the underlying distribution @xmath4 ) and @xmath54 see figure 1 .",
    "the markov process framework of keiding & gill ( 1990 ) now indicates that ( ignoring information about @xmath4 in @xmath45 , and just focussing on the transition with rate @xmath9 ) the product limit estimator @xmath29 is a natural estimator of the survivor function @xmath30 of interest , and consistency and asymptotic normality may be obtained as shown by keiding & gill ( 1990 , sec .  5 ) .",
    "note that the backwards intensity @xmath55 the _ backwards _ hazard - rate of a uniform distribution on a bounded interval @xmath56 , @xmath57 . since it has been assumed that @xmath0 has support interval @xmath6 , this shows that the present model _ may not _ be interpreted strictly as a left truncation model , which would require that @xmath58 was the backwards hazard rate of some probability distribution on @xmath6 .",
    "however , this distinction is not important to our discussion .",
    "the fact that @xmath58 does not depend on @xmath4 corresponds to winter and fldes statement that @xmath59 contains no more information than @xmath2 about @xmath4 .",
    "this already follows from sufficiency since the joint density of @xmath59 is @xmath20 .",
    "the likelihood function based on observation of @xmath60 is @xmath61 from which the npmle of @xmath4 is readily derived as @xmath62 that is the cox - vardi estimator in the terminology of winter and fldes ( cox 1969 , vardi 1985 ) .",
    "it follows that the estimator @xmath29 is _ not _ npmle .",
    "the important difference between the situation here and that of the random truncation model studied by keiding & gill ( 1990 , sec .",
    "3 ) is that not only the intensity @xmath63 , but also @xmath64 depends only on the estimand @xmath4 .",
    "as already mentioned , weak convergence of @xmath29 is immediate from keiding & gill ( 1990 , sec .  5 ) .",
    "in particular , in order to achieve the extension to convergence on @xmath65 $ ] it should be required that @xmath66 in the terminology of keiding & gill ( 1990 , sec .",
    "5c ) , and using @xmath67 and @xmath68 the integrability condition translates into @xmath69 or finiteness of @xmath70 where @xmath71 has the underlying ( `` length - unbiased '' ) interarrival time distribution @xmath4 .",
    "it may easily be seen from gill et al .",
    "( 1988 ) that the same condition is needed to ensure weak convergence of the cox - vardi estimator",
    ".    a variation of the observation scheme of this section would be to allow also right censoring of the @xmath12 .",
    "this can be immediately included in the markov - process / counting process approach leading to the inefficient product - limit type estimator @xmath29 ; the delayed - entry observations @xmath12 are simultaneously right - censored .",
    "see vardi ( 1985 , 1989 ) and asgharian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for treatment of the full non - parametric maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath4 , extending the cox - vardi estimator to allow right censoring .",
    "other ad hoc estimators and the rich relationships with a number of other important non - parametric estimation problems are discussed by denby and vardi  ( 1985 ) and vardi ( 1989 ) .",
    "we consider again a stationary renewal process on the whole line and assume that we observe it in some interval @xmath72 $ ] determined independently of the process .",
    "nonparametric estimation of the gap time distribution @xmath4 was definitively discussed by vardi ( 1982 ) in discrete time and by soon & woodroofe  ( 1996 ) in continuous time .",
    "cook & lawless ( 2007 , chapter  4 ) surveyed the general area of analysis of gap times emphasizing that the assumption of independent gap times is often unrealistic .",
    "we shall here nevertheless work under the assumption of the simplest possible model as indicated above .",
    "because the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is computationally involved it may sometimes be useful to calculate less efficient alternatives , and there are indeed such possibilities .    under the observation scheme indicated above we may have the following four types of elementary observations + 1 .",
    "times @xmath73 from one renewal to the next , contributing the density @xmath74 to the likelihood .",
    "+ 2 . times from one renewal @xmath75 to @xmath76 , which are right - censored versions of 1 . , contributing factors of the form @xmath77 to the likelihood .",
    "+ 3 . times from @xmath78",
    "to the first renewal @xmath75 ( forward recurrence times ) , contributing factors of the form @xmath79 to the likelihood .",
    "knowledge that no renewal happened in @xmath72 $ ] , actually a right - censored version of 3 . , contributing factors of the form @xmath80 to the likelihood .",
    "+ mcclean & devine ( 1995 ) studied nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation in the conditional distribution given that there is at least one renewal in the interval , i.e. , that there are no observations of type 4 .",
    "our interest is in basing the estimation only on complete or right - censored gap times , i.e. , observations of type 1 or 2 .",
    "when this is possible , we have simple product - limit estimators in the one - sample situation , and we may use well - established regression models ( such as cox regression ) to account for covariates .",
    "pea et al .",
    "( 2001 ) assumed that observation started at a renewal ( thereby defining away observations of type 3 and 4 ) and gave a comprehensive discussion of exact and asymptotic properties of product - limit estimators with comparisons to alternatives , building in particular on results of gill ( 1980 , 1981 ) and sellke ( 1988 ) .",
    "the crucial point here is that calendar time and time since last renewal both need to be taken into account , so the straightforward martingale approach displayed by andersen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is not available .",
    "pea et al .",
    "also studied robustness to deviations from the assumption of independent gap times .",
    "as noted by aalen & husebye ( 1991 ) in their attractive non - technical discussion of observation patterns , observation does however often start between renewals .",
    "( in the example of keiding et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , auto insurance claims were considered in a fixed calendar period ) . as long as observation starts at a stopping time , inference is still valid , so by starting observation at the first renewal in the interval we can essentially refer back to pea et al .",
    "a more formal argument could be based on the concept of the _ aalen filter _ , see andersen et al .",
    "( 1993 , p.  164 ) .",
    "the resulting product - limit estimators will not be fully efficient , since the information in the backward recurrence time ( types 3 and 4 ) is ignored .",
    "it is important to realize that the validity of this way of reducing the data depends critically on the independence assumptions of the model .",
    "keiding et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , cf .  keiding ( 2002 ) for details , used this fact to base a goodness - of - fit test on a comparison of the full nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator with the product - limit estimator .",
    "similar terms appear in another model , called the _ laslett line segment problem _ ( laslett , 1982 ) .",
    "suppose one has a stationary poisson process , with intensity @xmath18 , of points on the real line .",
    "we think of the real line as a calendar time axis , and the points of the poisson process will be called _ pseudo renewal times _ or _ birth times _ of some population of individuals .",
    "suppose the individuals have independent and identically distributed lifetimes , each one starting at the corresponding birth time .",
    "the corresponding calendar time of the end of each lifetime can of course be called a _ death time_.",
    "now suppose that _ all we can observe _ are the intersections of individuals lifetimes ( thought of as time segments on the time axis ) with an observational window @xmath72 $ ] . in particular , we do not know the current age of an individual who is observed alive at time @xmath78 .",
    "again we have exactly the same four kinds of observations : + 1 .",
    "complete _ proper _ lifetimes corresponding to births within @xmath72 $ ] for which death occurred before time @xmath76 .",
    "censored _ proper _ lifetimes corresponding to births within @xmath72 $ ] for which death occurred after time @xmath76 .",
    "complete _ residual _ lifetimes corresponding to births which occurred at an unknown moment before time @xmath78 , and for which death occurred after @xmath78 and before time @xmath76 .",
    "censored _ residual _ lifetimes corresponding to births which occurred at an unknown moment before time @xmath78 , for which death occurred after time @xmath76 , and which are therefore censored at time @xmath76 .",
    "+ the _ number _ of at least partially observed lifetimes ( proper or residual ) is random , and poisson distributed with mean equal to the intensity @xmath18 of the underlying poisson process of birth times , times the factor @xmath81 this provides a fifth , `` poisson '' , factor in the nonparametric likelihood function for parameters @xmath18 and @xmath4 , based on all the available data . maximizing over @xmath18 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the mean of the poisson distribution is estimated by the observed number of partially observed lifetimes .",
    "thus we find that the _ profile likelihood _ for @xmath4 , and the _ marginal likelihood _ for @xmath4 based only on contributions 1.4 .",
    ", are proportional to one another .",
    "nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of @xmath4 was studied by wijers  ( 1995 ) and van der laan ( 1996 ) , cf .",
    "van der laan & gill ( 1999 ) .",
    "some of their results , and the calculations leading to this likelihood , were surveyed by gill ( 1994 , pp .  190  ff . ) .",
    "the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is consistent ; whether or not it converges in distribution as @xmath18 tends to infinity is unknown , the model has a singularity coming from the vanishing probability density of complete lifetimes just larger than the length of the observation window corresponding to births just before the start of the observation window and deaths just after its end .",
    "van der laan showed that a mild reduction of the data by grouping or binning leads to a much better behaved nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator . if the amount of binning decreases at an appropriate rate as @xmath18 increases , this leads to an asymptotically efficient estimator of @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure can be thought of as _ regularization _ , a procedure often needed in nonparametric inverse statistical problems , where maximum likelihood can be too greedy .",
    "both `` unregularized '' and regularized estimators are easy to compute with the em algorithm ; and the speed of the algorithm is not so painfully slow as in other inverse problems , since this is still a problem where `` root @xmath3 '' rate estimation is possible .",
    "the problem allows , just as we have seen in earlier sections , all the same inefficient but rapidly computable product - limit type estimators based on various marginal likelihoods .",
    "moreover since the direction of time is basically irrelevant to the model , one can also look at the process `` backwards '' , leading to another plethora of inefficient but easy estimators .",
    "one can even combine in a formal way the censored survival data from a forward and a backward time point of view , which comes down to counting all uncensored observations twice , all singly censored once , and discarding all doubly censored data .",
    "( this idea was essentially suggested much earlier by r.c .",
    "palmer and d.r .",
    "cox , cf .",
    "palmer(1948 ) ) .",
    "the attractive feature of this estimator is again the ease of computation , the fact that it only discards the doubly censored data , and its symmetry under reversing time .",
    "the asymptotic distribution theory of this estimator is of course not standard , but using the nonparametric delta method one can fairly easily give formulas for asymptotic variances and covariances . in practice",
    "one could easily and correctly use the nonparametric bootstrap , resampling from the partially observed lifetimes , where again a resampled complete lifetime is entered twice into the estimate .",
    "the laslett line segment problem has rather important extensions to observation of line segments ( e.g. , cracks in a rock surface ) observed through an observational window in the plane . under the assumption of a homogenous poisson line segment process",
    "one can write down nonparametric likelihoods , maximize them with the em algorithm ; it seems that regularization may well be necessary to get optimal `` root @xmath3 '' behaviour but in principle it is clear how this might be done .",
    "again , we have the same plethora of inefficient but easy product - limit type estimators . van zwet ( 2004 ) studied the behaviour of such estimators when the line segment process is not poisson , but merely stationary .",
    "the idea is to use the poisson process likelihood as a quasi likelihood , i.e. , as a basis for generating estimating equations , which will be unbiased but not efficient , just as in parametric quasi - likelihood .",
    "van zwet shows that this procedure works fine .",
    "coming full circle , one can apply these ideas to the renewal process we first described in this section , and the other models described in earlier sections .",
    "all of them generate stationary line segment processes observed through a finite time window on the line .",
    "thus the nonparametric quasi - likelihood approach can be used there too . since in the renewal process case",
    "we are ignoring the fact that the intensity of the point process of births equals the inverse mean life - time , we do not get full efficiency .",
    "so it is disputable whether it is worth using an inefficient ad - hoc estimator which is difficult to compute when we have the options of soon and woodroofe s fully efficient ( but hard to compute ) full nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator , and the many inefficient but easy and robust product - limit type estimators of this paper .",
