    "spreading of infectious diseases is one of the major threats to human society and understanding their dynamics is crucial to control them .",
    "when modeling the dynamics of infectious diseases in large - scale populations , it is often useful to adopt a metapopulation approach   @xcite .",
    "the detailed , most of the time unknown , network of contacts between individuals is then replaced by a coarse - grained network , where nodes represent regions in which individuals interact , _",
    "e.g. _ , cities , and where links correspond to flows of individuals between the nodes .",
    "the computational and mathematical analysis of metapopulation models aims at identifying how network topology and model parameters affect the global epidemics . in a majority of realistic scenarios ,",
    "nodes of metapopulation networks tend to exhibit a strong heterogeneity in their size and their degree .",
    "for instance , in the case of network of cities , it is well known that the size of cities is distributed according to a power - law  @xcite , and that their total flow is well approximated by their size  @xcite .",
    "recent research has mainly focused on the impact of the degree distribution on epidemic spreading  @xcite , but the effect of their size distribution remains , to our knowledge , poorly known .",
    "directly related to this problem , the dependency of the contact rate between individuals on the size of population is a central theme in mathematical epidemiology  @xcite . to date , most studies have used terms that are either population - dependent , where the contact rate varies linearly with population size , or population - independent , where the rate is constant . in the literature ,",
    "directly transmitted diseases such as measles , and foot and mouth disease , tend to be described by population - dependent models  @xcite , whereas sexually transmitted diseases such as hiv are usually considered population - independent  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , studies have shown that models parameterized with different transmission terms can predict very different quantitative and qualitative infection dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest an intermediate scenario , where the scaling of contact rate on population size takes the general form @xmath0 with @xmath1 . in this direction ,",
    "empirical measures on rodents have shown that the standard modeling parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be significantly rejected , and that the observed scaling exponent lies between these two extremes  @xcite . in a different context , in the urban sciences , where the size of cities is known to play a fundamental role for collective social behaviors  @xcite , recent research based on mobile phone data has also shown that the total number of contacts grows super - linearly with city population size  @xcite .",
    "taken together , these findings motivate the study of metapopulation models with general contact rates , and a better understanding of the impact of city size distribution on epidemic spreading .",
    "we consider a metapopulation network ( we simply call it the network hereafter ) , composed of @xmath4 nodes with @xmath5 particles on it .",
    "particles move between nodes through the links and nodes serve as substrate of interaction between particles .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that particles interact with each other according to so - called susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) dynamics  @xcite , in line with the preceding works  @xcite . in the sis dynamics ,",
    "a particle takes either of two states , _",
    "i.e. _ , susceptible ( s ) and infected ( i ) , and the infection and recovery processes are described as follows : @xmath6 here we assume that the infection rate @xmath7 is different for every node  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . aside from the reactions , particles perform diffusion between nodes with diffusion coefficient @xmath10 and @xmath11 for susceptible and infected particles , respectively . in general ,",
    "sis dynamics has an absorbing state corresponding to the the disease - free equilibrium where there is no infected particle .",
    "the sis dynamics exhibits a phase transition at a threshold value @xmath12 such that in the case of @xmath13 the endemic equilibrium emerges and there is a finite fraction of infected particles at the stationary state  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of @xmath12 for arbitrary metapopulation networks is the main concern of the present study .",
    "we assume that interaction between particles within a node and diffusion of particles between nodes occur simultaneously  @xcite , instead of the two - step process of reaction and diffusion investigated in @xcite . in the continuous time limit",
    ", the average behavior of the dynamics can be described by the deterministic reaction - diffusion equation on an arbitrary network  @xcite as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the number of susceptible and infected particles at node  @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the total number of particles at node  @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath17 , is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "matrix @xmath19 denotes the random - walk laplacian whose elements are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the element of adjacency matrix @xmath22 and equal to unity if nodes @xmath8 and @xmath23 are adjacent and equal to zero otherwise .",
    "degree @xmath24 of node  @xmath8 represents the number of links connected to the node . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the network is connected ( _ i.e. _ , consists of a single connected component ) via undirected and unweighted links and is simple .",
    "in other words , @xmath22 is a symmetric matrix , with diagonal elements @xmath25 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the total number of particles is conserved throughout the process . the average number of particles on a node is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the infection rate at node  @xmath8 is set to depend on @xmath17 as a power - law scaling given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "this scaling , motivated by recent empirical findings  @xcite described in the introduction , was also considered in refs .",
    "a special case @xmath29 corresponds to the density - dependent sis dynamics @xcite and @xmath30 the so - called mass interaction which was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . instead of considering a binary setting where @xmath31 for nodes with a small population and @xmath32 for nodes with a large population  @xcite , we assume the same @xmath33 for all nodes such that infection rate continuously increases with population size .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the known results about the dynamics under the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) approximation  @xcite . under the hmf approximation ,",
    "the nodes with the same degree are assumed to behave in the same way on average . to be more precise , equations   and",
    "are reduced to @xmath34 in uncorrelated networks , @xmath35 holds true ( where @xmath36 is the average degree of the network ) and the equations are simplified as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the condition of parameters for realizing the endemic equilibrium in the long - term limit ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) . in this limit , if @xmath42 , @xmath43 converges to the stationary distribution @xmath44 regardless of the other parameters .",
    "equations   and have a fixed point @xmath45 which corresponds to the disease - free equilibrium . the endemic equilibrium arises when the disease - free equilibrium is unstable .",
    "the linear stability of the disease - free equilibrium is determined by the jacobian matrix at the fixed point : @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 are @xmath49 matrices and @xmath50 is the @xmath49 zero matrix , where @xmath51 is the maximum @xmath24 in the network .",
    "the elements of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the kronecker delta .",
    "the disease - free equilibrium becomes unstable when the real part of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath56 is positive . as we see in eq .",

    "then , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath56 is given by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath53 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of @xmath53 satisfies @xmath61 therefore , the sufficient condition of @xmath62 for positive @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 and an upper bound of the endemic threshold @xmath12 is derived as @xmath65 this upper bound of endemic threshold is trivially determined by the most susceptible node , that is the most populated one where the infection rate is maximum in our setting .",
    "although we only reviewed the analysis for uncorrelated networks , the same upper bound is also proven for correlated random networks , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath66 ( see theorem  4.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in closing this section",
    ", it is worth to mention the relationship with the endemic threshold derived in the previous studies .",
    "when we set @xmath3 and @xmath67 for the two - step reaction - diffusion modeling  @xcite and @xmath68 for the simultaneous reaction - diffusion modeling  @xcite ( the same as one we adopt in this paper ) , the endemic threshold @xmath12 is exactly derived as @xmath69 this functional form of @xmath12 implies that the heterogeneity in @xmath70 plays a crucial role in determining the critical point , as one observes in the percolation processes  @xcite and epidemic processes on contact networks ( _ i.e. _ , networks between individuals )  @xcite .",
    "the two studies reporting this @xmath12  @xcite have an assumption in common on deriving eq .",
    "; the diffusion of infected particles are very fast and thus @xmath71 holds true . under this assumption",
    ", the endemic threshold @xmath12 for any value of @xmath33 is given by eq .  .",
    "if this assumption does not hold true , the exact @xmath12 is no longer tractable and its upper bound is obtained as described above .",
    "we first prove that the upper bound @xmath72 ( given by eq .  ) also holds true for arbitrary networks ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the following results are essentially in parallel with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the most important difference with these studies is that they assume a hmf approximation , except for ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas we derive our results directly from the adjacency matrix of the network , thereby considering arbitrary networks free from this approximation .    as we saw in the derivation with the hmf approximation ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : hmf ] ) , we consider the stability of the disease - free equilibrium @xmath73 @xmath74 of the original reaction - diffusion equations ( given by eqs .   and with @xmath75 ) .",
    "the linear stability of the disease - free equilibrium is determined by the jacobian matrix at the equilibrium : @xmath76 all matrices @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath50 are with size @xmath80 .",
    "matrix @xmath50 is zero matrix .",
    "the element of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by @xmath81 because the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are in @xmath82  @xcite , the eigenvalues of @xmath77 are in @xmath83 and negative regardless of parameter values .",
    "therefore , to derive the condition for the endemic equilibrium , we investigate the largest eigenvalue of @xmath78 , denoted by @xmath84 , in the following .    before moving to general cases , we note two special cases in which we can exactly derive @xmath12 . as the first case , when @xmath2 , the element of @xmath78 is equal to @xmath85 therefore , @xmath84 is given by @xmath86 and it leads to @xmath87 . as the second case , when the network is regular and @xmath88 @xmath74 , the element of @xmath78 is equal to @xmath89 therefore , @xmath84 is given by @xmath90 and it leads to @xmath91 .",
    "it is worthy to note that the endemic threshold @xmath12 is independent of diffusion rate @xmath11 for these two cases .",
    "now we consider general cases with @xmath92 on a non - regular network .",
    "for the convenience for calculation , we symmetrize @xmath78 via the following similarity transformation  @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents a diagonal matrix whose @xmath95-element is equal to @xmath96 .",
    "element of @xmath97 is given by @xmath98    when the largest eigenvalue of @xmath97 , denoted by @xmath99 , is positive , the disease - free equilibrium is unstable and the endemic equilibrium arises . as we did for the case with hmf approximation ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : hmf ] ) , we estimate a lower bound of @xmath99 ( that leads to an upper bound of @xmath12 ) . by using the rayleigh quotient , @xmath99",
    "is given by @xmath100    we show that the upper bound for hmf approximation can be easily recovered as follows .",
    "let us set @xmath101 in which only the @xmath8-th element of @xmath102 is equal to unity and the rest equal to zero . with this @xmath102 , @xmath103 therefore , @xmath104 and we obtain the sufficient condition of @xmath62 as @xmath105 notice that this sufficient condition for the endemic state is equivalent to that for hmf approximation given by eq .",
    "@xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we show an improved upper bound of @xmath12 and argue its relationship with the so - called rich - club phenomenon observed in real networks .",
    "our idea of improvement stems from the observation that the upper bound given by eq .",
    "is achieved via approximation of the principal eigenvector of @xmath97 with a vector of zeros except for the element corresponding to a single node with @xmath51 .",
    "we relax the criterion about node degree and approximate the principal eigenvector with a normalized vector whose element increases with @xmath24 of the corresponding nodes .",

    "let us focus on the right hand side of eq .   with @xmath116 .",
    "if there is no link between the nodes with @xmath117 , then @xmath118 and we recover eq .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath119 , the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .   is smaller than the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "and we obtain a smaller upper bound .",
    "we denote the right hand side of eq .   by @xmath120 , as an improved upper bound of endemic threshold to be compared with @xmath72 .    the expression on the right hand side of eq .",
    "is closely related to so - called rich - club phenomenon of networks  @xcite , characterized with a high connectivity between nodes with large degree , and to the presence of a @xmath121-core @xcite , as we discuss further below .",
    "formally , the rich - club phenomenon is defined by focusing on @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number of nodes with degree larger than @xmath121 and @xmath124 is the total number of links between these nodes .",
    "the value of @xmath125 for the original network is usually compared to @xmath126 of a network generated by randomly rewiring links while preserving degree of each node . if @xmath127 for large values of of @xmath121 , the network is said to exhibit the rich - club phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath128 which appears in eq .",
    "is similar to @xmath125 and we expect that @xmath120 would estimate @xmath129 better especially when the network has the rich - club structure ( see sec .  [ sec : airport ] for a real network example ) .",
    "it should be noted that our derivation of eq .",
    "results from the stability analysis of the dynamical process while @xmath125 is purely based on network structure .",
    "the sufficient condition @xmath120 depends on the rate of contacts inside high degree nodes , as previously , but also on the structure of the network , via the existence of links between these high - degree nodes . the extent to which @xmath120 improves @xmath72 depends on the underlying network .",
    "it is also important to stress that structure becomes more and more important as @xmath130 is increased , and the disease rapidly mixes in the population .",
    "it is worth noting the relationship between our upper bound @xmath120 given by eq .   and",
    "another upper bound recently derived based on a mean - field approximation taking into account the correlation of degrees between adjacent nodes  @xcite , @xmath131 \\left(\\frac{k_i}{{\\langle k \\rangle}}\\rho \\right)^{-\\gamma } \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : sufficient_mfc}\\ ] ] where the subscript mfc stands for mean - field approximation with correlated structure . if @xmath132 holds true for the @xmath107 minimizing both eqs .   and , @xmath133 is equivalent to @xmath120 .",
    "the accuracy of each upper bound is expected to vary depending on the structural correlations present in the network .",
    "it should be noted that the derivation of @xmath133  @xcite assumes a mean - field approximation of the dynamical process , where nodes with the same @xmath24 value behave in the same manner ( as we saw in eqs .   and in sec .",
    "[ sec : hmf ] ) .",
    "in contrast , our derivation of @xmath120 is directly derived from eq.([eq : rhoii ] ) and is free from such an approximation .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath133 does not take into account , by definition , structural correlations beyond those of the degrees between adjacent nodes , and that @xmath133 is determined by point correlation @xmath134 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath120 is also affected by degree correlations , but it depends on the global structure of the network , as the rich - club phenomenon , because correlations are considered in a range of @xmath24 .",
    "we will compare the accuracy of @xmath120 and @xmath133 in the next section for both synthetic and empirical networks .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the accuracy of the upper bounds of @xmath12 ( that we obtained and reviewed in sec .  [ sec : arbitrary ] ) by comparing them with numerical simulations of the epidemic dynamics . for the sake of simplicity , we assume @xmath135 and fix @xmath136 .",

    "the sis dynamics can hit the absorbing state , _",
    "i.e. _ , the disease - free equilibrium with non - zero probability , due to stochastic fluctuations . to circumvent this issue and compute the stationary state ,",
    "we adapt the so - called quasi - stationary simulation method  @xcite in which , every time the system reaches the absorbing state , the configuration of the nodes states is replaced with one chosen randomly from the history .",
    "we also implement the simulation as it is done for migration processes  @xcite , by not distinguishing particles and keeping only @xmath142 for each node .",
    "the time evolution is simulated as a set of transitions of the markov chain in which a state corresponds to a configuration @xmath143  @xcite . for each combination of parameters values ,",
    "we calculate @xmath144 as follows .",

    ". finally , in sec .  [ sec : airport ] , we consider the case of the us airports network , and show that the endemic threshold for a real - world rich - club network is closer to @xmath120 than to @xmath72 and @xmath133 .",

    "however , real - world networks are neither purely random nor deterministic but often exhibit structural correlations .",
    "a typical example of structural correlation is the correlation of the degrees between adjacent node pairs , so - called degree assortativity @xcite .",

    "we focus on its largest connected component with @xmath194 nodes and @xmath195 links .",
    "the degree assortativity coefficient @xmath170 of the focal network is equal to @xmath196 .",
    "the rich - club structure fosters the assortative mixing in the network , but it does not always lead to a positive @xmath170 value of the whole network because the rich - club phenomenon pays attention only to the nodes with large @xmath121 values . in this sense , the relationship between the degree correlation and rich - club phenomenon is not trivial . with numerical simulations , we examine to what extent @xmath120 improves @xmath72 and @xmath133 in this empirical network relevant to real - world epidemics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : usair](a ) , we first evaluate the dependence of the r.h.s . of and on @xmath121 for @xmath182 .",
    "the minimum value of each curve corresponds to @xmath120 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "because @xmath72 is independent of @xmath121 , it is plotted as a horizontal line . while the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .   follows a u - shape curve and takes its minimum at @xmath197 , the r.h.s .",
    "monotonically decreases with @xmath121 and takes its minimum at @xmath198 , and its minimum value is equal to @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , one finds @xmath199 for the us airports network when @xmath182 .    in fig .",

    "the vertical arrows point the three upper bounds @xmath120 , @xmath72 , and @xmath133 , with @xmath72 and @xmath133 overlapping , as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : usair](a ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath72 ( equal to @xmath201 ) is far from the value @xmath12 measured in the simulations , whereas @xmath120 ( equal to @xmath202 ) drastically improves the estimation .",
    "these results support our main claim that rich - club networks have a smaller upper bound for @xmath12 than non rich - club networks with the same degree sequence .",
    "the difference between the upper bounds is then studied for values of @xmath33 in the range @xmath203 $ ] , as an exact expression of @xmath12 can be derived for @xmath2 , and that the three upper bounds are invalid for this value ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : general_case ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : usair](c ) , we plot the values of @xmath12 estimated from the simulations and the three upper bounds are plotted as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that @xmath133 is very close to @xmath72 over the whole the range of @xmath33 for this network .",
    "for @xmath204 , @xmath120 is more accurate than @xmath72 and @xmath133 and closer to the simulation results , while the three upper bounds are equivalent for large values of @xmath33 ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : usair](c ) ) .",
    "interestingly , real - world data tend to present small values of @xmath33  @xcite , in the regime where @xmath120 improves most the accuracy of the estimate .",
    "in the present study , we have investigated the sis epidemic dynamics on arbitrary metapopulation networks where the infection rate at each node depends on its population size .",
    "we have proved that the upper bound of endemic threshold @xmath12 , previously obtained on the basis of an heterogeneous mean - field approximation , holds true even for arbitrary networks , regardless of this approximation . for an arbitrary network ,",
    "the upper bound is achieved by assuming that a single node with the largest degree determines the onset of the endemic state .",
    "in addition , we have derived an improved upper bound for the endemic threshold , which decreases when the network possesses more links between large degree nodes .",
    "this structural property is directly related to the so - called rich - club phenomenon , observed in a variety of real - world networks .",
    "we have verified the resulting upper bounds with numerical simulations on network models , and on an empirical network , the us airports network , exhibiting the rich - club phenomenon and relevant to epidemic spreading .",
    "our finding that rich - club networks favor epidemic spreading is reminiscent of recent results showing connections between endemic threshold and @xmath121-core structure for sis dynamics on quenched contact networks ( _ i.e. _ , networks between individuals )  @xcite . a @xmath121-core in a network",
    "is defined by the subgraph remaining after repeatedly removing nodes with degree smaller than @xmath121 while recalculating nodes degree on every node removal  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "a @xmath121-core with a large @xmath121 represents a highly - connected subgroup of nodes with large degrees .",
    "it was shown with numerical simulations  @xcite that nodes in the @xmath121-core sustain infection , a mechanism related to the finding that these nodes are influential initial spreaders for susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic dynamics  @xcite on contact networks  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , prior to these physical studies , the impact of coreness in epidemic process was established in public health studies  ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "although we considered metapopulation networks instead of contact networks , our finding suggests that a similar mechanism might occur in our case , as a highly - connected subgroup of nodes with large degrees sustains infection and favors onset of an endemic state .",
    "this work opens interesting research questions related to epidemic dynamics on metapopulations networks .",
    "first , the upper bound @xmath120 is essentially obtained by estimating the principal eigenvector of the jacobian matrix of the disease - free equilibrium , by using local network structure only ( namely , node degree @xmath24 ) . as we have shown in the us airports network , this upper bound improves results obtained in the mean - field approach , but there is still room for improvement in order to predict the actual @xmath12 measured in numerical simulations .",
    "further improvement could be found by taking into account higher - order structural properties , such as community structure @xcite .",
    "second , in this paper , we have focused on the endemic threshold solely , but other quantities describe other properties of the dynamical process , often crucial from a theoretical point of view but also in practical public health .",
    "an important example is the fraction of infected particles at the stationary state , which requires nonlinear analytical approaches because the nonlinear terms associated with @xmath205 are not negligible and the linearization of the system fails in this regime .",
