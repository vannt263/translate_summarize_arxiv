    "many interesting objects associated to integrable models and representation theory are known to satisfy difference or differential equations .",

    "quantum deformations of these equations yield difference equations , known as quantum knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( qkz ) equations ; they arise independently as equations satisfied by correlation functions and form factors of quantum integrable models @xcite and by matrix elements of intertwiners for representations of quantum affine algebras @xcite .",
    "more recently , connections with combinatorics have been extensively investigated when the ( multiplicative ) shift parameter in the equations assumes root - of - unity values , in conjunction with the razumov - stroganov conjectures for loop models , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "cherednik @xcite constructed generalizations of the qkz equations in terms of a so - called r - matrix datum associated to arbitrary affine root systems . in this framework",
    "the aforementioned `` original '' qkz equations correspond to the case where the affine root system is of type a and are related to integrable systems with periodic boundary conditions ( or rather twisted - periodic or quasi - periodic , but we will nevertheless use `` periodic '' in our terminology ) .",
    "if the affine root system is of a different classical type ( i.e. of type b , c or d ) we arrive at the _ boundary qkz equations _",
    "( bqkz ) , relating to integrable systems with up to two reflecting boundaries . in the current work",
    "we will focus on the case when the affine root system is of type c - since the affine weyl groups of types b and d naturally appear as normal subgroups of the affine weyl group of type c , many of our results can be straightforwardly modified to results for types b and d.    the bqkz equations were first studied and motivated in their own right in @xcite , where they describe correlation functions of semi - infinite spin chains with integrable boundary conditions",
    ". it would be interesting to find other motivations , analogous to the ones for the type a qkz equations .",
    "this paper provides such a motivation by showing that in the limit that the shift parameter goes to 1 , the bqkz equations are related , through yang s notion of scattering matrices , to interpolants of commuting transfer matrices , which is entirely parallel to an observation by gaudin ( * ? ? ?",

    "for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , write @xmath5 for multiplication by @xmath6 in the @xmath7-th entry : @xmath8 the qkz equations are the following system of @xmath6-difference equations for meromorphic functions @xmath9 : @xmath10 for certain _ qkz transport matrices _",

    "appendix [ sec : linearalgebra ] . can be seen as a condition expressing the equivalence of the two possible factorizations of a three - particle interaction into three two - particle interactions .",
    "then , a global condition , follows from the ybe and other local conditions .    in the type b , c and d cases the above r - matrix datum ( solutions of the ybe ) has to be extended by two operators @xmath20 , meromorphically depending on @xmath21 , the so - called k - matrices .",
    "they are required to satisfy _ reflection equations _ ( res ) , also known as boundary yang - baxter equations , one corresponding to either of two boundaries present in the system .",
    "the _ left and right reflection equations _ ( lre , rre ) are the relations @xmath22 both acting on @xmath23 ; here @xmath24 with the `` flip '' @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "( [ lrerk]-[rrerk ] ) express the equivalence of the two possible factorizations of a two - particle - and - boundary interaction into two one - particle - and - boundary interactions .",
    "we will review the precise expression of the qkz transport matrices in terms of the r- and k - matrices in section [ sec : inhtfermatsandscatmats ] .    in the special case that @xmath28 the consistency condition simplifies to the statement that the matrices @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) mutually commute .",
    "the @xmath29 correspond to the _ scattering matrices _ introduced by yang in his investigations into the delta bose gas @xcite .",
    "scattering matrices predate the qkz equations and play an important role in quantum integrability ( cf .",
    "10 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "hence we may view as a @xmath6-deformed criterion for integrability .",
    "moreover , the qkz equations then naturally appear in this story as being deformations of the eigenvector equation for scattering matrices with eigenvalue 1 , thus motivating the study of ( solutions of ) qkz equations ( also see e.g.  the introductory remarks in @xcite ) .",
    "another main criterion of quantum integrability is baxter s notion of commuting _",
    "transfer matrices _ which is at the basis of the quantum inverse scattering method ( algebraic bethe ansatz ) as developed by the faddeev school from the 1980s ; for textbook accounts see @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix , originally associated specifically to vertex models from statistical mechanics , is a parameter - dependent linear operator @xmath31 acting on a state space @xmath32 .",
    "as before , if @xmath33 , transfer matrices can be built up from local operators in such a way that the integrability criterion ( commutavity ) can be derived from local integrability conditions like the ybe .",
    "also , it is possible to introduce an additional dependence on an @xmath34-tuple of complex numbers ( so - called inhomogeneities ) into the transfer matrix , yielding inhomogeneous transfer matrices . in section [ sec : transfermatrices ] we study transfer matrices in more detail .",
    "the method of commuting transfer matrices is best understood in the case of systems with periodic or `` closed '' boundary conditions , but for systems with reflecting or `` open '' boundary conditions there is a more elaborate version due to sklyanin @xcite , who constructed commuting _",
    "boundary transfer matrices _ from r- and k - matrices and derived the algebraic bethe ansatz for special types of r- and k - matrices .",
    "similar to the setup for the qkz transport matrices , two k - matrices are required .",
    "one of these can be taken equal to one of the k - matrices featuring in the qkz transport matrix , say @xmath35 ; thus it satisfies the rre . in the present context",
    "it is crucial that with that choice , the other necessary k - matrix @xmath36 is in general not a solution of the lre , but a third reflection equation .",
    "gaudin ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) has highlighted that scattering matrices are proportional to interpolants of inhomogeneous transfer matrices ( those with the spectral parameter running through the set of inhomogeneities ) , in case the underlying affine root system is of type a. thus the problem of finding eigenvectors of transfer matrices is related to the problem of finding eigenvectors of scattering matrices , adding to the relevance of the qkz equations .",
    "for the bqkz equations , such a connection with inhomogeneous boundary transfer matrices has heretofore been unclear , as observed by pasquier @xcite ; this owes mainly to the fact that the k - matrices for the left boundary appearing in the formulae satisfy different reflection equations .",
    "we address this question in thm .",
    "[ thm : connection ] , thus providing a new motivation for the bqkz equations . for the case where @xmath37 and the r - matrix is of @xmath38-type this connection was made in @xcite ; earlier it was also made in @xcite for k - matrices diagonal in the cartan basis of @xmath16 .",
    "each of the main three sections of this paper is split up in a part about periodic systems and a part on reflecting systems , the former of which consists mainly of a review of existing results which is provided as a background for the new results proposed in the latter .    in section [ sec : transfermatrices ] we will discuss transfer matrices for periodic and reflecting systems for general state spaces @xmath32 ( not necessarily tensor products of local state spaces @xmath39 ) .",
    "the new result here addresses an unsatisfactory aspect of the state - of - affairs of quantum integrability for reflecting systems , namely the large number of conditions on the r - matrix datum required to establish the commutativity of the boundary transfer matrices in @xcite , both compared to the analogon in the periodic case and to the requirements for the consistency of the bqkz equations .",
    "this problem has already been reduced significantly in @xcite and @xcite and in the current work the main improvement ( cf .",
    "[ thm : commutingtransfermatrices ] ) is to show it is unnecessary to assume unitarity or crossing symmetry of the r - matrix , as in the periodic case , essentially leaving the appropriate res at both boundaries as the only conditions .",
    "from here onwards we will focus on the case @xmath33 . in section [ sec : inhtfermatsandscatmats ]",
