    "the discovery of the high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) in copper - oxide based compounds - cuprates ( bednorz and mller 1986 ) revived the interest in materials containing transition elements .",
    "the main feature of these materials is the crucial role of electron - electron interactions .",
    "this can result in electronic properties , very unusual when compared to the behaviour of conventional metals .",
    "although the unconventional sc is clearly the most puzzling phenomenon in cuprates , we focus in this review predominantly on the analysis of more or less anomalous properties of the normal state which deviate essentially from the standard understanding of electrons in metals and still present one of the major theoretical challenges in the solid state physics .",
    "the cuprate superconductors have a very anisotropic structure , where the common building blocks are layers , in cuprates formed by combining one of the three possible structural elements containing cu and o , as shown in fig .  [ 1.1]b .",
    "the cuo layered structures are stacked in the crystal , separated by various intercalant layers in different cuprates . in spite of vast differences in the structure of unit cells , electronic properties of the whole family of cuprates",
    "are quite universal .",
    "this can be explained by the predominant role of generic cuo@xmath2 planes , fig .",
    "[ 1.1]a , where conducting electrons reside .",
    "the electronic coupling between cuo@xmath2 planes is very weak , resulting in a huge ratio of the in - plane resistivity to the perpendicular resistivity , in the anisotropy of the sc coherence length etc .",
    "intermediate layers serve mainly as a charge reservoir for the planes .",
    "consequently properties of cuprates are quite well classified according to the doping level of the reference cuo@xmath2 electronic structure .",
    "as now well established , the reference cuprate compounds , as la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , are mott ( charge - transfer ) insulators due to strong correlations which induce in a half - filled band a charge gap @xmath6ev .",
    "the spin degrees of planar cuo@xmath2 electrons can be well mapped on the properties of a planar antiferromagnetic ( afm ) @xmath7 heisenberg model .",
    "the afm ground state of undoped materials , emerging from strong correlations , has been quite early recognized as a crucial starting point for theoretical considerations ( anderson 1987 ) of doped materials , being strange metals in the normal state and exhibiting high transition temperature @xmath8 to the sc state .",
    "there are by now numerous indications that essential features of electronic properties of the doped afm , as realized in cuprates , are well represented by prototype single - band models of correlated electrons , as the hubbard model and the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( rice 1995 ) . in spite of their apparent simplicity",
    "both models are notoriously difficult to treat analytically , in particular in the most interesting regime of strong correlations .",
    "the lack of analytical tools for correlated electrons ( for a general introduction see fulde 1991 ) has increased the efforts towards numerical approaches ( dagotto 1994 ) , which predominantly can be divided into two categories : the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods and the exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which incorporates the strong correlation requirement explicitly , is more adapted to the ed approach .",
    "so far most calculations were performed for the ground state ( g.s . ) at @xmath9 , where the standard lanczos technique ( lanczos 1950 ) offers an efficient ed analysis of small systems of reasonable sizes .",
    "recently , present authors ( jakli and prelovek 1994a ) introduced a novel numerical method , combining the lanczos method with a random sampling , which allows for an analogous treatment of statics and dynamics of many - body quantum models at @xmath10 .",
    "the latter method , further referred to as the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) , and results for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model obtained using this method , are the main subject of this review .",
    "the final goal is to understand properties of doped afm in general , and of high-@xmath8 cuprates in particular . in the absence of reliable analytical methods and results",
    ", numerical calculations can help to answer several crucial questions .",
    "are strong correlations , as incorporated in prototype models , enough to account for anomalous normal - state properties of the strange metal ? which are the relevant energy and temperature scales in doped afm , as represented by the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , and",
    "in which properties do they show up ? which is the unifying phenomenological description of the normal state ?",
    "is the @xmath0-@xmath1 model sufficient , or which ingredients should be added to account qualitatively and quantitatively for observed properties ?",
    "can we learn something macroscopically meaningful from the studies of small systems , and why ?",
    "we note that at present the sc seems to be beyond the reach of numerical approaches including the ftlm , hence we do not investigate here in more detail the possible existence of sc and its origin in model systems .",
    "reference cuprate compounds are afm insulators and are so far best understood .",
    "properties of various other layered cuprates can be interpreted in terms of doping the reference material , where ( mainly ) holes are introduced into cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "one of the major conceptual achievements , which emerged from careful experimental investigations of high - quality materials in the last decade , has been the realization of quite universal electronic phase diagram ( hwang _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , batlogg _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , batlogg 1997 ) , revealing characteristic temperature scales as they develop as the function of hole doping .",
    "it is at present quite common to classify materials with respect to doping as underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped , and the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2.1 ] .",
    "experimentally optimum doping is chosen to correspond to materials with the highest @xmath8 within the given class of chemically and structurely related compounds .",
    "it has been realized soon after the discovery of high-@xmath8 sc that also normal state properties at @xmath11 of the optimally doped materials are very anomalous , but at the same time also most universal .",
    "the prominent feature is the resistivity law @xmath12 ( takagi _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , valid essentially in the whole measurable range @xmath11 and clearly contradicting the normal landau - fermi - liquid ( lfl ) behaviour @xmath13 .",
    "related is the observation that the dynamical conductivity @xmath14 does not fall off for larger @xmath15 according to the drude form @xmath16 , but rather as @xmath17 ( tanner and timusk 1992 ) .",
    "the clearest evidence for an anomalous spin dynamics comes from the nmr and nqr relaxation ( slichter 1994 ) , where the relaxation rate @xmath18 on planar @xmath19cu in optimally doped la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) with @xmath22 is nearly @xmath23-independent ( as well as nearly doping independent ) in contrast to the usual korringa law for metals @xmath24 . the qualitative difference , i.e. a large enhancement of low - frequency spin fluctuations at low @xmath23 , can be related to the persistence of short range afm fluctuations , even at the optimum doping .",
    "the support for this comes also from neutron scattering experiments , where a substantial afm correlation length @xmath25 has been measured in the same class of materials , with @xmath26 ( birgeneau _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) .",
    "on the other hand , several properties at the optimum doping seem to be close to the normal lfl picture .",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on cuprates ( shen and dessau 1995 ) , most reliable for bisrcacuo ( biscco ) compounds , shows electronic excitations consistent with a large fermi surface ( fs ) and with the conserved fs volume ( luttinger theorem ) , although spectral shapes are quite distinct from a simple lfl picture . the specific heat ( loram _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) follows in the normal state roughly the lfl behaviour @xmath27 with @xmath28 not very far from the free - fermion value , consistent with a nearly @xmath23-independent uniform susceptibility @xmath29 , whereby the wilson ratio is close to the free - fermion one ( loram _ et al .",
    "it is also the unifying characteristic of the optimum doping that properties do not reveal above @xmath8 any additional characteristic @xmath23 scale .      in overdoped materials",
    "@xmath8 is decreasing and finally vanishing with increased doping . at the same time the electronic properties are getting closer to the usual metallic behaviour consistent with the lfl scenario .",
    "e.g. , the resistivity behaviour moves towards the normal flf form @xmath30 ( takagi _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , spectral shapes of electronic excitations , as revealed by arpes , become sharper near the fs ( marshall _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) etc .",
    "these facts can be put together with a decreasing intensity of afm fluctuations .",
    "it is thus plausible that we are dealing in the overdoped regime with the crossover to the normal lfl , however this crossover is not a trivial one and so far also not well understood either .",
    "the most evident progress in the investigations of normal - state properties has been made in last few years for the underdoped cuprates .",
    "in contrast to the optimum doping , experiments reveal in this regime additional characteristic temperatures @xmath11 ( batlogg _ et al _ 1994 ) , which show up as the crossovers where particular properties qualitatively change . as summarized in fig .  [",
    "2.1 ] , there seems to be an indication for two distinct crossovers .",
    "the existence of both as well as their distinction is still widely debated , nevertheless we will refer to them as the afm crossover scale @xmath31 and the pseudogap scale @xmath32 for the lower one ( batlogg 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 scale ( batlogg _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) shows up most clearly as the maximum of the spin susceptibility @xmath33 ( torrance _ et al .",
    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath34 is linear @xmath35 for @xmath36 and decreases more steeply for @xmath37 .",
    "characteristic is also the anomalous @xmath23-dependence of the hall constant @xmath38 for @xmath37 ( ong 1990 , hwang _",
    "the latter is evidently hole - like in the classical sense @xmath39 , which is also not properly understood theoretically .",
    "it seems plausible that the @xmath31 crossover is related to the onset of short - range afm correlations for @xmath37 , since in the undoped afm @xmath31 corresponds just to a well understood maximum due to a gradual transition from a disordered paramagnet to the one with short - range afm correlations .",
    "the crossover @xmath32 has been first identified in connection with the decrease of the nmr relaxation @xmath18 for @xmath40 ( takigawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , slichter 1994 ) , indicating the reduction of low - energy spin excitations interpreted as the opening of the spin pseudogap in underdoped materials .",
    "most striking evidence for an additional energy scale in underdoped cuprates is the observation of the leading - edge shift in arpes measurements at @xmath11 ( marshall _ et al _ 1996 ) , indicating features of the @xmath41-wave sc gap persisting within the normal phase .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the designation of crossover features is at present still controversial . in particular",
    "it is not evident whether we are dealing with two or more essentially different energy scales .",
    "properties of the normal lfl follow from the one - to - one correspondence of low - energy excitations of the interacting fermion system to that of a free - fermion gas .",
    "the prerequisite is that the volume of the fs is conserved ( luttinger 1960 ) .",
    "essential are the well defined quasiparticles ( qp ) with the vanishing damping at the fs , with @xmath42 .",
    "consequences are the linear specific heat @xmath43 , nearly @xmath23-independent static and dynamical spin susceptibilities , the korringa law for nmr relaxation @xmath24 , the resistivity @xmath44 etc . experimental facts on cuprates contradict the usual lfl picture .",
    "several more or less elaborated scenarios have been proposed to capture main anomalous features .",
    "focusing on the importance of afm spin fluctuations , the concept of a _ nearly afm fermi liquid _ ( nafl ) has been elaborated ( see e.g. monthoux and pines 1994 ) . here",
    "one assumes that at low - frequencies @xmath45 at all @xmath46 , as expected in a lfl , but with strongly enhanced fluctuations near the afm wavevector @xmath47 , corresponding to the critical slowing down in the proximity of a phase transition to the afm - ordered state .",
    "the following form has been proposed , which can be derived also via the self - consistent paramagnon theory ( moriya _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) , @xmath48 in the proposal by millis _",
    "( 1990 ) , originally devoted to the interpretation of the nmr and nqr relaxation , the main @xmath23-dependence is expected to arise from the afm correlation length @xmath25 , which is assumed to show a critical behaviour as @xmath23 is decreased , i.e. @xmath49 . in order to explain the anomalous nqr relaxation @xmath50 ( imai _ et al . _ 1993 ) , contradicting the korringa law , strong @xmath23-dependence of @xmath25 is essential with @xmath51 , as well as low @xmath52 and large @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( monthoux and pines 1994 ) .",
    "the form of spin fluctuations is the basis for further investigations of the charge dynamics , strongly coupled to spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculated response functions such as the conductivity appear also anomalous , e.g. the resistivity is close to a linear law @xmath12 .",
    "there are several proposals , analogous to the nafl in the basic idea of _ the proximity to a critical point _ , enhancing fluctuations in the optimum doping regime .",
    "one proposal invokes the quantum critical scaling of the spin dynamics , established in the nonlinear sigma model ( chakravarty _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , induced by doping the afm ( sokol and pines 1993 ) .",
    "another scenario relates the quantum critical point to a charge - density - wave instability ( castellani _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of experimental facts has been provided by the concept of a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) ( varma _ et al .",
    "the hypothesis is that there exist excitations , contributing both to the charge and spin response , which show in a broad range of wavevectors @xmath55 anomalous susceptibilities of the form @xmath56 ) the single - particle self - energy @xmath57 is also anomalous .",
    "assuming its @xmath58-independence in a broad range , it has been postulated using phenomenological arguments ( littlewood and varma 1991 ) , @xmath59 , \\qquad x=\\max(|\\omega|,\\pi t ) , \\label{cp3}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a high - frequency cutoff .",
    "hence the qp lifetime @xmath61 is anomalous , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "it should be however mentioned that the ansatz ( [ cp3 ] ) is not unique and also modified forms have been invoked , e.g. in the analysis of the optical conductivity ( el azrak _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , baraduc _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) better fit has been obtained with @xmath63 while the fs should remain well defined with the volume equal to that of free fermions , the corresponding qp weight @xmath64 at the fs , given by @xmath65 vanishes on the fs in analogy to the case of a one - dimensional luttinger liquid ( haldane 1981 ) .",
    "the mfl concept accounts for several remarkable properties at the optimum doping , as the anomalous resistivity @xmath66 , the optical conductivity @xmath67 , the nmr and the nqr relaxation rate @xmath50 .",
    "note that the only low - energy scale within the mfl scenario , equations ( [ cp2 ] ) - ( [ cp3a ] ) , is given by @xmath23 .",
    "although there are certain similarities to the nafl and other critical - point scenarios , the essential difference of the mfl concept is a non - critical @xmath55 dependence .",
    "hence the critical behaviour within the mfl is rather a local one .",
    "the attempts to derive mfl behaviour from a microscopic model have not been successful so far .",
    "a similarity of electronic properties in a wide class of different cuprates serves as a strong indication that the appropriate microscopic model should be quite universal and must in first place describe the electrons restricted to cuo@xmath2 orbitals within a single plane .",
    "there has been quite an extensive effort put into finding a proper model , and at present there seems to be a wide consensus on its main features .",
    "this should be contrasted to various other materials with interacting electrons , e.g. heavy fermions and 1d conductors , where microscopic models are much less known .    since the physics of electrons in cuo@xmath2 planes is governed by cu @xmath68 orbitals and o @xmath69 orbitals ( see the structure in fig .",
    "[ 1.1 ] ) , quite a complete model seems to be the three - band hubbard model ( emery 1987 ) , describing fermion carriers ( holes ) added to closed @xmath70 and @xmath71 shells .",
    "parameters are the cu  o hopping @xmath72 , the direct o  o hopping @xmath73 , the on - site energies @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and the corresponding coulomb repulsions @xmath76 , @xmath77 on cu and o sites , respectively .",
    "parameters correspond to the charge - transfer regime with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the reference ( insulator ) material contains one fermion / cell , entering predominantly the @xmath41 orbitals . due to @xmath80 , a large charge gap @xmath81ev opens at half filling , while spin degrees can be mapped on the isotropic @xmath7 heisenberg model , first proposed in connection with cuprates by anderson ( 1987 ) .",
    "holes added by doping enter the singlets , introduced by zhang and rice ( 1988 ) , which can be in a fermion model treated as empty sites ( holes ) .",
    "such a reduction , confirmed also with other analytical approaches ( zaanen and ole 1988 , ramak and prelovek 1989 ) and cluster methods ( hybertsen _ et al . _ 1990 ) , leads to a single - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( rice 1995 ) , @xmath82 describing fermions in a tight - binding band with the hopping parameter @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 are the local spin operators interacting with the exchange parameter @xmath85 . due to the strong on - site repulsion states with doubly occupied sites",
    "are explicitly forbidden and we are dealing with projected fermion operators @xmath86 .    by explicitly projecting out states with doubly occupied sites ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model only allows for charge fluctuations in terms of a hole motion , while at half - filling it is equivalent to the @xmath7 heisenberg model .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is expected to capture the essential low - energy physics of doped afm as well of cuprates in the whole regime of dopings .",
    "the challenging regime of the model is the one of strong correlations with @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is the simplest model which describes the interplay of magnetism and itinerant metallic properties of cuprates .",
    "a more rigorous reduction of the three - band model ( zaanen and ole 1988 , ramak and prelovek 1989 ) leads to additional terms , which could be as well represented within a reduced space without doubly occupied sites . among possible generalizations most",
    "attention has been recently devoted to the addition of the next - nearest - neighbour ( n.n.n . ) hopping ( @xmath88 ) terms , emerging from the @xmath73 hopping in the three - band model , @xmath89 representing the hopping along the diagonal in fig .  [ 1.1]a .",
    "analogous is the @xmath90 term for the n.n.n . hopping along each axis .",
    "it seems necessary to include such a term to account for the qp dispersion found in arpes experiments on undoped material , such as sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 ( wells _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . in spite of their apparent smallness , @xmath88 and @xmath90 terms could lead to relevant corrections since they allow a free propagation of fermions even in an afm ( nel ) spin background .    the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , as relevant for cuprates ,",
    "should be considered on a planar square lattice .",
    "parameters are rather well known ( rice 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is measured in the undoped afm via the inelastic neutron scattering and the magnon dispersion , leading to @xmath91  ev .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath0 is not accessible directly , but cluster calculations ( hybertsen _ el al .",
    "_ 1990 ) and other considerations ( rice 1995 ) allow only for a narrow range of @xmath0 values . in our calculations we shall furtheron use ( if not declared differently ) @xmath92  ev and @xmath93.a possible range for @xmath88 ( hybertsen _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) is more controversial , while in numerical studies ( tohyama and maekawa 1994 , nazarenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) values @xmath94 are used .",
    "another prototype model for strongly correlated electrons is the traditional hubbard model ( hubbard 1963 ) , @xmath95 high - energy excitations of the hubbard model could be different from those of the charge - transfer regime in the three - band model , still it is expected that the low - energy properties map well on those of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model provided that @xmath96 . in the following",
    "we shall mainly consider @xmath10 properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "it should be however noted that prior to the introduction of the ftlm method most calculations of @xmath10 properties have been performed for the hubbard model by applying qmc methods ( dagotto 1994 ) .",
    "this chapter is devoted to the description of the ftlm which we developed ( jakli and prelovek 1994a ) for studying correlated systems at @xmath10 and which is used to obtain results described furtheron .",
    "the goal was to calculate @xmath10 properties in small model systems and to find a method , comparable in efficiency to g.s .",
    "calculations employing ed methods , used in the past decade extensively in the study of correlated systems ( dagotto 1994 ) .    here",
    "we should stress that the advantage of @xmath10 calculations is twofold .",
    "it is evident that we are interested in static and dynamical properties at nonzero @xmath23 , in particular in their @xmath23-variation . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of finite but small @xmath10 represents the proper approach to more reliable g.s .",
    "calculations in small systems .",
    "namely , it is well known that g.s .",
    "ed results , in particular for dynamical quantities , are strongly influenced by finite size artifacts . at @xmath10",
    "the latter effects can to large extent average out , leading to more macroscopic - like results . still the understanding of remaining finite - size restrictions is important for the proper application of the method , as will be described in sec .",
    "3.7 . in sec",
    "we put our approach in perspective with other methods yielding @xmath10 results for models of correlated electrons .",
    "these includes mainly various qmc methods and the high-@xmath23 expansion ( hte ) technique .",
    "the scarcity of well - controlled analytical approaches to models of strongly correlated electrons has stimulated the development of computational methods .",
    "conceptually the simplest is the ed method of small systems . in models of correlated electrons , however , one is dealing with the dimension of the basis ( number of basis states ) which grows exponentially with the size of the system . in the hubbard model",
    "there are 4 basis states for each lattice site , therefore the number of basis states in the @xmath97-site system is @xmath98 . in",
    "the @xmath99 model @xmath100 still grows as @xmath101 . in the ed of such systems",
    "one is therefore representing operators with matrices @xmath102 , which become large already for very modest values of @xmath97 .",
    "the helpful circumstance is that for most interesting operators and lattice models only a small proportion of matrix elements is nonzero within the local basis .",
    "then , the operators can be represented by sparse matrices with @xmath100 rows and at most @xmath103 nonzero elements in each row . in this way",
    "memory requirements are relaxed and matrices up to @xmath104 are considered in recent applications .",
    "finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such large matrices is not possible with standard algorithms performing the full diagonalization .",
    "one must instead resort to the power algorithms ( see parlett 1980 ) , among which the lanczos algorithm ( lanczos 1950 ) is one of the most widely known .",
    "the lanczos algorithm starts with a normalized random vector @xmath105 in the vector space in which the hamiltonian operator @xmath106 is defined .",
    "@xmath106 is applied to @xmath105 and the resulting vector is split in components parallel to @xmath105 , and @xmath107 orthogonal to it , respectively , @xmath108 since @xmath106 is hermitian , @xmath109 is real , while the phase of @xmath107 can be chosen so that @xmath110 is also real . in the next step @xmath106",
    "is applied to @xmath107 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is orthogonal to @xmath105 and @xmath107 .",
    "it follows also @xmath113 .",
    "proceeding with the iteration one gets in @xmath114 steps @xmath115 by stopping the iteration at @xmath116 and putting the last coefficient @xmath117 , the hamiltonian can be represented in the basis of orthogonal lanczos functions @xmath118 as the tridiagonal matrix @xmath119 with diagonal elements @xmath120 with @xmath121 , and offdiagonal ones @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "such a matrix is easily diagonalized using standard numerical routines to obtain approximate eigenvalues @xmath124 and the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath125 , @xmath126 it is important to realize that @xmath125 are ( in general ) not exact eigenfunctions of @xmath106 , but show a remainder @xmath127 on the other hand it is evident from the diagonalization of @xmath119 that matrix elements @xmath128 are exact , without restriction to the subspace @xmath129 .    if in the equation ( [ fl3 ] ) @xmath117 , we have found a @xmath130-dimensional eigenspace where @xmath119 is already an exact representation of @xmath106 .",
    "this inevitably happens when @xmath131 , but for @xmath132 it can only occur if the starting vector is orthogonal to some invariant subspace of @xmath106 .",
    "this should not be the case if the input vector @xmath105 is random , without any hidden symmetries .    the number of operations needed to perform @xmath133 lanczos iterations scales as @xmath134 . numerically the lanczos procedure is subject to roundoff errors , introduced by the finite - precision arithmetics .",
    "this problem usually only becomes severe at larger @xmath135 ( more than needed to get accurate g.s .",
    "@xmath136 ) and is seen in the loss of the orthogonality of vectors @xmath118",
    ". it can be remedied by successive reorthogonalization ( and normalization ) of new states @xmath137 , plagued with errors , with respect to previous ones .",
    "however this procedure requires @xmath138 operations , and can become computationally more demanding than lanczos iterations alone .",
    "this effect prevents one to use the lanczos method e.g. to tridiagonalize large matrices .",
    "the identity ( [ fl7 ] ) already shows the usefulness of the lanczos method for the calculation of particular matrix elements . as an aid in a further discussion of the lanczos method we consider the calculation of a matrix element @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an arbitrary normalized vector , and @xmath141 are general operators .",
    "one can calculate this expression exactly by performing two lanczos procedures with @xmath142 steps .",
    "the first one , starting with the vector @xmath143 , produces the subspace @xmath144 along with approximate eigenvectors @xmath125 and eigenvalues @xmath124 .",
    "the second lanczos procedure is started with the normalized vector @xmath145 and results in the subspace @xmath146 with approximate @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we can now define projectors @xmath149 which for @xmath150 can also be expressed as @xmath151 by taking into account definitions ( [ fe3 ] ) , ( [ fe4 ] ) we show that @xmath152 since in addition @xmath153 and @xmath154 , by successive use of the first equality in ( [ fe5 ] ) we arrive at @xmath155 using the second equality in the equation ( [ fe5 ] ) and identities @xmath156 , @xmath157 we can rewrite @xmath158 as @xmath159 we note that the necessary condition for the equation ( [ fe7 ] ) is @xmath160 .",
    "we finally expand the projectors according to expressions ( [ fe4 ] ) and take into account the orthonormality relation ( [ fl7 ] ) for matrix elements , and get @xmath161 we have thus expressed the desired quantity in terms of the lanczos ( approximate ) eigenvectors , and eigenvalues alone .      within the lanczos algorithm the extreme ( smallest and largest ) eigenvalues @xmath162 , along with their corresponding @xmath163 , are rapidly converging to exact eigenvalues @xmath164 and eigenvectors @xmath165 .",
    "it is quite characteristic that usually ( for nondegenerate states ) @xmath166 is sufficient to achieve the convergence to the machine precision of the g.s .",

    "this is not surprising in view of the experimental facts for cuprates where at optimum doping @xmath1178 and our @xmath1179 .",
    "nevertheless we note that certain restrictions follow already from the mfl - type dynamics .",
    "e.g. , the particular mfl form ( [ eo2 ] ) for @xmath14 leads at @xmath220 to a divergent integral on the lower bound @xmath577 and hence violates the optical sum rule ( [ ec9 ] ) .",
    "therefore such a form can not apply to arbitrary low @xmath23 giving an indication for the existence of a lower crossover @xmath1177 .",
    "the underdoped regime @xmath1137 is less convenient for the ftlm approach .",
    "one reason is that @xmath332 is increasing towards the undoped afm . at the same time",
    "the low - energy ( pseudogap ) scale is increasing and its effects are for certain quantities hardly resolvable from finite - size effects , hence they increase the uncertainty of results .",
    "still there are clear indications for the pseudogap scale @xmath31 within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "most evident is the maximum in @xmath713 , as presented in sec .  6.2 .",
    "quite a similar behaviour can be followed also for @xmath1180 , as deduced e.g. from fig .",
    "this is related to nearly constant wilson ratio @xmath1181 , as defined in the equation ( [ mu2 ] ) .",
    "note that such a behaviour has been found also experimentally by loram _",
    "( 1996 ) , extending to low-@xmath23 regime not reachable in our calculations .",
    "it is quite evident from @xmath723 that the pseudogap scale @xmath31 is related to the onset of short range afm correlations .",
    "it seems that the same phenomenon governs the pseudogap appearing in the dos @xmath1182 in the underdoped regime , as discussed in sec",
    "while the pseudogap is clearly visible for lowest @xmath369 , e.g. for @xmath963 , it is becomes more shallow towards the optimum doping @xmath424 .",
    "this is consistent with pes measurements by ino _",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "experimentally one of the indications for @xmath31 is also the change of the slope in @xmath34 . here",
    "our results are less conclusive and appear to be finite - size limited for @xmath37 .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the qp scattering in the presence of longer range afm correlations becomes a different one , in particular the mean free path @xmath327 increases due to the opening of the spin pseudogap . in our small systems",
    "this possibly leads to @xmath1183 and consequently to a finite - size @xmath1184 which can not be interpreted uniquely .",
    "note that so far there is neither a satisfactory theory nor a numerical calculation of the mobility @xmath1185 , even for a single hole in an afm which could serve as a guide for the limit @xmath406 .",
    "experiments indicate the existence of a lower crossover scale @xmath32 ( batlogg 1997 ) , see fig .",
    "[ 2.1 ] , identified as a spin gap in the nmr relaxation and appearing also in the arpes , @xmath494 etc . in our calculations it would be easiest to resolve the existence of a spin gap in @xmath713 and in @xmath785 , still we do not find an indication for that down to @xmath1186 .",
    "one of the main conclusions of this work is that the prototype @xmath0-@xmath1 model , in spite of its apparent simplicity , accounts surprisingly well for a variety of normal state properties of cuprates . this confirms the belief that most unusual properties are dominated by strong correlations and by the interplay of antiferromagnetism and itinerant character of electrons , both effects being inherent within the model .",
    "the agreement is a qualitative but as well a quantitative one , hence the parameters of the model appear to be really microscopic ones in the whole range of doping and not just some effective parameters changing with doping .",
    "there are evidently many open questions regarding the interpretation and the understanding of our results , and related experimental facts on cuprates :    \\a ) the universal mfl - type dynamics in the intermediate regime , which seems to be well founded by our results on @xmath14 , @xmath872 and self energies , as well as by experimental facts , lacks a proper theoretical explanation , although some relations have been proposed already ( littlewood and varma 1991 , prelovek 1997a ) .",
    "\\b ) there are more fundamental problems in the underdoped regime .",
    "one of them is the evolution of the fs in the limit @xmath1187 .",
    "a number of authors investigated the evidence for the small fs - hole pockets ( eder and becker 1991 , eder _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) and its possible consequences ( trugman 1990 ) at low doping , also stimulated by recent arpes measurements ( marshall _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) of underdoped materials . in a strict sense at @xmath220 the transformation from a large to",
    "a small fs seems to require a phase transition with a qualitative change in a number of properties .",
    "there is no evidence for that neither in experiments nor in our small - system analysis . on the other hand our spectral functions at lowest @xmath499",
    "reveal a folding of qp dispersion analogous to a single hole in an afm .",
    "still it is possible that such a feature coexists with a normal qp dispersion crossing of a large fs , however with a weight @xmath1188 , i.e. gradually vanishing with doping as predicted by the equation ( [ ss2 ] ) .",
    "such a scenario is not in contradiction with arpes results .",
    "it has been in fact recently deduced from the integrated pes experiments ( ino _ et al . _",
    "1997b ) , still it would be hard to establish it beyond doubt .",
    "\\c ) related is the question of the thermodynamics at very low doping .",
    "there is a distinction whether at low @xmath23 qp behave as a degenerate fermi gas with finite qp weight @xmath1189 even for @xmath406 , or as a nondegenerate system of spin polarons with @xmath1188 . in the first case",
    "one could expect for @xmath1190 a finite electron compressibility @xmath1191 , as discussed in sec .",
    "4.1 , while the alternative would induce @xmath1192 .",
    "our results are not conclusive in this respect , there is however also a numerical evidence for the latter scenario within the hubbard model ( furukawa and imada 1992 , assaad and imada 1996 ) .",
    "there are several quantities which we did not discuss in this review .",
    "one of most challenging is the hall effect , which is known to be anomalous .",
    "unfortunately the inclusion of a real magnetic field @xmath900 increases computational efforts ( see sec .",
    "6.7 ) , while at the same time also the physics of the hall conductivity is less local .",
    "the anomalous properties of the orbital diamagnetism @xmath882 and its relation to the hall effect , equation ( [ mo1 ] ) , nevertheless confirm the anomalous behaviour of @xmath38 .",
    "also perpendicular @xmath494 is known to be a challenge for theoreticians .",
    "still it appears that the interplane transport is essentially incoherent for @xmath11 , so it could be possibly related to the knowledge of planar spectral functions @xmath907 .",
    "the major open question within the @xmath0-@xmath1 ( or hubbard ) model is still the existence of additional low energy scales and of related low-@xmath23 transitions .",
    "there are certain indications that such scales must exist in such models , it remains however a subject of future studies to find whether such transitions lead to an ordered spin and charge structure or to desired superconductivity .",
