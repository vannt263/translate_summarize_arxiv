    "a category can be equipped with a _ ( sub)additive _ norm satisfying , for all objects @xmath2 and all pairs of composable arrows @xmath3 @xmath4 or also with a _ ( sub)multiplicative _ norm , satisfying : @xmath5",
    "the first case appears when the norm expresses a ` cost ' ( length , duration , price , energy , ... ) which can ` at worst ' be added in a composition ( typically , in a concatenation of paths ) .",
    "the second is usual with lipschitz norms , where the norm expresses a scale factor ( or , rather , a best bound for that ) , which can ` at worst ' be multiplied in a composition .",
    "a normed additive category ( like normed vector spaces and bounded linear mappings ) makes use of both aspects : its hom - sets are abelian groups equipped with an _ additive _ norm , but composition is _",
    "multiplicative_. the ` same ' happens in a _",
    "normed ring _ - a normed additive category on one object , or a monoid object in the category of additively weighted abelian groups , with multiplicative tensor product .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate such aspects and fix a coherent terminology .",
    "as shown in the well - known article of lawvere on ( generalised ) metric spaces @xcite , the additive notion ( 1 ) is based on the category of extended positive real numbers , @xmath6 , with arrows @xmath7 , equipped with a strict symmetric monoidal closed structure , which we write @xmath8 : the tensor product is the sum @xmath9 and the internal hom is defined by truncated difference , @xmath10 .",
    "one derives from @xmath11 the symmetric monoidal closed category @xmath12 of _ normed sets _ ( [ 1.4 ] ) , written @xmath13 in @xcite and more explicitly described in a paper by betti - galuzzi @xcite . a category enriched on the latter ( cf . [ 3.1 ] ) has an additive norm , as in ( [ 0.1 ] ) .",
    "but the same category @xmath14 can be equipped with a _ multiplicative _ tensor product @xmath15 . _",
    "provided we define _",
    "@xmath16 ( so that tensoring by 0 preserves the initial object @xmath17 ) , the latter is again a strict symmetric monoidal closed structure @xmath18 : the internal hom is @xmath19 , where the ` undetermined forms ' @xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined to be 0 .",
    "( this choice comes from privileging the direction @xmath7 , which is necessary if we want to view ( 2 ) as an expression of enrichment ; cf . [ 1.2 ] . )",
    "multiplication gives a _ multiplicative _ symmetric monoidal closed structure @xmath22 , on the category of normed sets ; enrichment on the latter means a multiplicative norm , cf . [",
    "the new multiplicative structure @xmath23 is * -autonomous ( barr @xcite ) , with involution @xmath24 ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "( lipschitz norms are viewed in @xcite in a different way , based on endofunctors of @xmath8 , cf .",
    "[ 3.5 ] . )",
    "now , these ` norms ' are ` generalised norms ' , in the same way as lawvere metrics are generalised ones :",
    "\\(a ) they can take an infinite value ,    \\(b ) they are not ` hausdorff ' : @xmath25 does not imply @xmath26 ( when this makes sense ) ,    \\(c ) they are ` directed ' : we do not assume @xmath27 ( when this makes sense ) .",
    "this is why we prefer to speak of _ weights _ ( or _ costs _ ) rather than norms : a _ weighted abelian group _ , as defined here ( [ 2.2 ] ) , is a much weaker notion than a normed abelian group in the classical sense . as a typical example , the free weighted abelian group on one element is the group of integers @xmath28 , equipped with the weight where @xmath29 for @xmath30 and otherwise @xmath31 ( [ 2.2 ] ) ; the weighted field @xmath32 of reals has a similar weight ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "these examples also exhibit how _ weights ( can ) have a directed character _ : a weighted abelian group has an associated preorder , where the positive cone is given by the _",
    "attainable _ elements ( of finite weight ; cf . [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "this paper is a preparation for a sequel where , starting from some works in ` directed algebraic topology ' ( cf . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", we shall develop a study of ` weighted algebraic topology ' , where ` weighted spaces ' ( for instance , the generalised metric spaces of lawvere ) can be studied - via homotopy or homology - with _ additively weighted _ categories ( [ 3.1 ] ) or with _ additively weighted _",
    "abelian groups and their _ multiplicative _ tensor product .",
    "a first study of weighted homology for weighted cubical sets can be found in @xcite , showing links with noncommutative geometry .",
    "finally , it may be interesting to pay some reflection to the _ algebraic _ structure which makes @xmath0 an ` algebra of measures ' or ` weights ' . as briefly considered in [ 1.8 ] , @xmath0 is a commutative semiring , equipped with an involution which transforms sum and multiplication into other operations .",
    "such a structure also exists in the complex projective line @xmath33 , whose additive structure and involution @xmath34 yield the calculus of _ impedances _ and _ admittances _ , in rlc networks . but @xmath0 has an _ order _ , which allows us to treat it as a category ( cf . [ 1.2 ] ) , and it is not clear if and how this aspect should be partially transferred to @xmath35 ( cf . [ 1.8 ] ) .    .",
    "the author is indebted with f.w .",
    "lawvere , r. betti , g. rosolini for various helpful discussions .",
    "weighted sets , equipped with a weight function @xmath36 , have two tensor products , derived from two tensor products on the category of weights @xmath1 , i.e. addition and multiplication .",
    "all these structures are symmetric monoidal closed .",
    "we end with some speculation on ` algebras of weights ' ( [ 1.8 ] ) .",
    "quantities are generally measured by positive real numbers .",
    "it is convenient to use the interval @xmath0 of _ extended _ positive real numbers , including @xmath37 , which will be called _",
    "real weights _ , or just _ weights_. for instance , if we are considering the resistance @xmath38 of a conductor , the perfect conductor @xmath39 should have equal rights to be included as the perfect insulator @xmath40 ; also because the conductance @xmath41 reverses such values .",
    "the interval @xmath0 has a rich structure , of relevance for measures .",
    "first , it is totally ordered , which allows us to compare quantities of the same species , and a complete lattice ( thanks to including @xmath37 ) , obviously distributive .",
    "second , @xmath0 has a sum ( which measures a disjoint union of quantities of the same species ) and a multiplication ( corresponding to the product of physical quantities ) .",
    "it is a commutative _ semiring _ , letting @xmath42    since we want to use both operations , and some physical intuition here and there , we should insist on the fact that these weights are ` pure quantities ' : they do not stand for physical quantities but for their measures , with respect to a fixed system of units .",
    "let us also note that @xmath43 acts in the obvious way , except for the choice @xmath16 of the ` undetermined form ' , which is motivated below ( [ 1.2 ] ) . as to terminology",
    ", a _ semiring _ is here an ( additive ) abelian monoid equipped with a multiplication which is associative , has a unit and distributes over addition ; note that we do not ( can not ) require that 0 be absorbent for multiplication : the present notion is slightly weaker than a _ rig _ ( which is a monoid in the monoidal category of abelian monoids , cf .",
    "the prime example is the semiring @xmath44 of natural numbers , which is the free such algebra on the empty set .",
    "finally , there is in @xmath0 a ( well defined ) involution @xmath45 , whose physical interest is also obvious .",
    "this involution transforms the sum into another operation , which we call _ harmonic sum _",
    "@xmath46 of common use for @xmath47-norms , but also in geometrical optics and for resistor networks : in the latter case , composition in series of resistors leads to the sum of resistances , while composition in parallel leads to the sum of conductances , and the harmonic sum of resistances .",
    "( this interpretation suggests an extension to complex numbers , measuring impedances and admittances , see [ 1.8 ] . )    similarly , the involution transforms the multiplication into a commutative monoid operation @xmath48 which coincides with multiplication , except that it gives ` the other choice ' for the undetermined form : @xmath49 .",
    "one can also note that all translations @xmath50 preserve arbitrary meets ( while , generally , they do not preserve the empty join , 0 ) ; thus , reversing the order , @xmath51 is a commutative unital quantale .",
    "the same holds with the multiplicative structure @xmath52 , with definition ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the involution @xmath53 does not make any of these structures into an ` involutive quantale ' , according to the notion in use ( cf .",
    "mulvey - pelletier @xcite ) . the categorical counterpart of these facts is the closure of the two monoidal structures , @xmath9 and @xmath54 , considered below ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "our weight functions - for sets , abelian groups or categories - will take values in the commutative ordered semiring @xmath0 considered above .",
    "but we need to make it into a category .    as in lawvere @xcite",
    ", we use the _ opposite _ category @xmath55 , with morphisms @xmath56 ( which is necessary to treat normed categories as enriched ones ) .",
    "this category has all limits and colimits ( with trivial equalisers and coequalisers , of course ) @xmath57",
    "we will write @xmath58 this category equipped with the strict symmetric monoidal closed structure defined by the _ additive _ tensor product , @xmath59 . the internal hom is given by _",
    "truncated subtraction _ , and will be written as a difference ( as in @xcite ) : @xmath60 note that an ` undetermined form ' appears , and gets a precise value : @xmath61 ( since @xmath62 is always true , as @xmath63 ) .",
    "we will write @xmath64 the same category , equipped with the strict symmetric monoidal closed structure defined by the _ multiplicative _ tensor product @xmath54 ; recall that we have chosen @xmath65 , in [ 1.1 ] .",
    "( thus , tensoring with _ any _ element @xmath66 preserves the initial object @xmath17 , for the ` direction ' @xmath7 .",
    "but of course the opposite category @xmath67 is monoidal closed with tensor product @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . )    now , the internal hom for @xmath23 is given by division , with ` undetermined forms ' @xmath70 ( as required by the adjunction , after the previous choice ) @xmath71 this is a * -autonomous category @xcite , with dualising object the multiplicative identity 1 and involution @xmath72 .",
    "( it is thus a cl - algebra , i.e. an algebra for classical linear logic according to troelstra s book @xcite , or a commutative cyclic grishin algebra according to lambek @xcite . )",
    "we have already remarked that the derived operation @xmath73 ` nearly ' coincides with the multiplication ( [ 1.1 ] ) : the * -autonomous structure is ` nearly ' compact .",
    "one can also note that all finite @xmath74 are dualising elements , i.e. provide an involution @xmath75 ; but @xmath76 is the unique choice giving a ` nearly compact ' structure .",
    "note also that the values of the ` undetermined forms ' , @xmath77 , agree with the following identity ( holding in every * -autonomous category , in the right - hand form ) @xmath78 the two tensor products in the category @xmath55 have an interesting interplay , already examined above from the algebraic point of view .",
    "multiplication distributes on addition , and the involution @xmath53 of the * -autonomous multiplicative structure transforms @xmath11 into an anti - isomorphic symmetric monoidal closed category @xmath79 : the opposite category , equipped with the harmonic sum @xmath80 ( cf . ( [ 1.1.2 ] ) ) .",
    "these structures will be further examined in [ 1.8 ] .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the full subcategory of @xmath55 on the objects @xmath82 .",
    "note that , in this subcategory , the cartesian product @xmath83 coincides with both tensor products considered above , @xmath9 and @xmath84 , in ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) .",
    "the category @xmath85 ( ` v ' for verity ) is isomorphic to the boolean algebra @xmath86 of _ truth - values _ , a cartesian closed category with cartesian product @xmath87 .",
    "the covariant embedding ( contravariant with respect to the natural orders ) @xmath88 transforms the ( cartesian ) product in @xmath89 into the three tensor products of @xmath55 ( which coincide in @xmath90 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath91 has left and right adjoint @xmath92      a _ weighted set _ , or _",
    "w - set _ , will be a set @xmath2 equipped with a _ weight _ , or _ cost function _ ,",
    "consisting of an arbitrary mapping @xmath93 also written @xmath94 , or @xmath95 , or @xmath96 .",

    "thus , a product @xmath104 and a sum @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 has weight @xmath107 ) have the following weights @xmath108 while a _ weighted subset _ has the restricted weight , and a _ quotient _ @xmath109 has the induced one @xmath110 plainly , infinite products exist because we are allowing an infinite weight . by the same reason , the forgetful functor @xmath111 has a left adjoint @xmath112 , which equips the set @xmath113 with the _ discrete weight _ , always @xmath17 , and a right adjoint @xmath114 , with the _ codiscrete weight , _ always zero .",
