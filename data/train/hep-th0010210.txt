    "qed in 3-dimensions ( qed3 ) is a useful laboratory for studying the strong coupling limit of a gauge theory .",
    "the lack of ultraviolet divergences makes it easier to handle than its 4-dimensional counterpart .",
    "moreover , in the quenched approximation , it exhibits confinement which makes it attractive for investigating strong physics .",
    "the study of strong coupling gauge theories through the use of schwinger - dyson equations requires knowledge of the non - perturbative form of the fundamental fermion - boson interaction .",
    "the most commonly used approximation is the bare vertex .",
    "however , among other drawbacks , it fails to respect a key property of the underlying field theory , namely the gauge invariance of physical observables .",
    "an obvious reason is that the bare vertex fails to respect the ward - green - takahashi identity ( wgti )  @xcite .",
    "ball and chiu  @xcite have proposed an _",
    "ansatz _ for what is conventionally called the longitudinal part of the vertex which alone satisfies wgti .",
    "the rest of the vertex , the transverse part , remains undetermined .",
    "dynamical fermion mass generation has been previously studied in qed3 , both quenched and unquenched , using the bare vertex , as well as an _ ansatz _ based on a simple modification of the ball - chiu vertex @xcite .",
    "more recently , burden and tjiang have constructed a different _ ansatz _ for the full vertex to investigate fermion and photon propagators simultaneously @xcite , while including an explicit transverse piece .",
    "burden and tjiang base their _ deconstruction _ on the assumption that a certain transversality condition  for the fermion propagator holds non - perturbatively for some covariant gauge @xmath2 .",
    "the bare fermion propagator is then a solution in that gauge .",
    "accordingly , they go on to propose a transverse vertex and use it to study the photon propagator .",
    "the only truncation of the complete set of schwinger - dyson equations known so far that incorporates the key properties of a gauge theory at each level of approximation is perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , it is natural to assume that physically meaningful solutions of the schwinger - dyson equations must agree with perturbative results in the weak coupling regime .",
    "while in qed4 this realization has been of enormous help in constructing a physically acceptable form of the vertex @xcite , need exists to exploit perturbation theory in exploring the non - perturbative form of the vertex in qed3 .",
    "following @xcite , we evaluate the transverse part of the vertex to @xmath1 . this result",
    "is then assumed to be the weak coupling limit for the non - perturbative form of the transverse vertex .",
    "we also check the burden - tjiang transversality condition to two loops and find that to this order , it is not realized in perturbation theory .",
    "we evaluate @xmath3 to @xmath4 analytically and compare our findings with the conjecture of the vertex proposed by burden and tjiang .",
    "the full vertex , fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of 12 spin amplitudes formed from the vectors @xmath6 and the scalars 1,@xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it satisfies the ward - green - takahashi identity  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and the ward identity @xmath11 as the non - singular @xmath12 limit of eq .",
