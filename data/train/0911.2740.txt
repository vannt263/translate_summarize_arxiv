    "the structure of the @xmath0 resonance has been extensively discussed in strangeness nuclear / hadron physics  @xcite . from the viewpoint of hadron spectroscopy ,",
    "the @xmath0 is considered to be a meson - baryon molecule , since the coupled - channel scattering framework  @xcite seems to be favored over a simple three - quark picture , while possible multi - quark structure is also discussed . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 is of particular importance for the behavior of the kaon in nucleus  @xcite , since this resonance strongly dictates the subthreshold @xmath2 interaction  @xcite .",
    "clarification of the structure of the @xmath0 resonance as well as the study of @xmath3 in nucleus are within the scope of current / future experiments in facilities such as spring-8 , jefferson lab . , and j - parc .",
    "it is our aim here to study the structure of the @xmath0 resonance from the viewpoint of scattering theory .",
    "we utilize the theoretical framework of chiral coupled - channel approach  @xcite , where the excited baryons are described as resonances in the meson - baryon scattering amplitude , generated by the chiral low energy interaction . in this framework ,",
    "any components other than dynamical two - body state ( meson - baryon molecule ) are expressed by the castillejo - dalitz - dyson ( cdd ) pole contribution  @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the cdd pole contribution in the amplitude tells us about the origin of resonances .",
    "we present the method to extract such an information within the chiral coupled - channel framework  @xcite .",
    "we start with the general form of the amplitude based on the n / d method  @xcite , for @xmath4-wave single - channel meson - baryon scattering at total energy @xmath5 : @xmath6^{-1 } ,      \\label{eq : tchu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the kernel interaction constrained by chiral low energy theorem .",
    "the once subtracted dispersion integral @xmath8 can be identified as the meson - baryon loop function with dimensional regularization , and the subtraction constant @xmath9 plays the role of the cutoff of the loop function . in this way , eq .",
    "is regarded as the solution of the algebraic bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath7 is determined by the order by order matching with chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . at the leading order , @xmath7",
    "is given by the @xmath4-wave interaction of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the group theoretical factor , the baryon mass , and the meson decay constant , respectively .",
    "in the framework of n / d method , the cdd pole contribution should be included in the kernel interaction @xmath7 .",
    "the cdd pole contribution has been manifested in chiral dynamics by the introduction of an explicit resonance propagator , or the contracted resonance contribution from the higher order chiral lagrangian .",
    "we however show that the loop function @xmath8 can also have the cdd pole contribution  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from the viewpoint of the renormalization group ; once the amplitude @xmath14 is determined by experiments , then the change of the interaction @xmath15 can be absorbed by the change of the cutoff parameter @xmath9 in the loop function @xmath16 . in this case , the cdd pole contribution in the kernel @xmath15 may be effectively transferred to the loop function @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in order to study the origin of resonances in this approach , we should make the cdd pole contribution in the model under control .    for this purpose ,",
    "we propose the `` natural renormalization scheme , '' in which the cdd pole contribution is excluded from the loop function @xmath8 .",
    "this can be achieved by requiring ( i ) no state exists below the meson - baryon threshold , and ( ii ) the amplitude @xmath14 matches with the interaction kernel @xmath15 at certain low energy scale , based on the validity of chiral expansion .",
    "these conditions uniquely determine the subtraction constant in the natural renormalization scheme @xmath17 such that @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the similar condition was proposed in different contexts , but our point is to regard this condition as the exclusion of the cdd pole in the loop function , based on the consistency with the negativeness of the loop function .",
    "this natural renormalization scheme enables us to extract the cdd pole contribution hidden in the loop function in the phenomenological amplitude . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate it in a single - channel model .",
    "first , with the leading order wt term @xmath19 for the interaction kernel , we fit the experimental data by adjusting the subtraction constant @xmath20 for the conventional phenomenological approaches .",
    "we then try to construct an equivalent amplitude in the natural renormalization scheme with the subtraction constant @xmath21 and the effective interaction @xmath22 .",
    "the equivalence of the amplitude is achieved by @xmath23 this equation gives us the effective interaction @xmath24 as @xmath25 with an effective mass @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the expression   indicates that the interaction kernel @xmath28 can have a pole , whose relevance depends on the scale of the effective mass @xmath29",
    ". this pole can be the source of a resonance in the amplitude , and so it is interpreted as the cdd pole contribution . if @xmath30 is small , the effective pole mass @xmath31 becomes large and the second term of eq .",
    "can be neglected in the resonance energy region @xmath32 .",
    "if the difference @xmath30 is large , the effective mass @xmath29 gets closer to the threshold and the pole contribution is no longer negligible .",
    "thus , we can estimate the effect of the cdd pole contribution from the values of the effective mass @xmath29 .",
    "we analyze the meson - baryon scattering and the @xmath0 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 channel and the @xmath1 in @xmath35 and @xmath36 channel , using the method explained above .",
    "we use the phenomenological models  @xcite to determine the phenomenological subtraction constants @xmath37 .",
    "these models are based on the results in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the scattering observables are well reproduced by the interaction kernel of the wt term .",
    "the natural values of the subtraction constants @xmath38 are obtained by setting @xmath39 for all channels .",
    "we first evaluate the effective interaction in the natural renormalization scheme and extract the pole positions in the kernel .",
    "the nearest pole in each channel is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41.-coupled channels , the effective interaction has @xmath42 poles , and a pair of complex poles can also appear  @xcite . ]",
    "it is observed that the pole for the @xmath1 lies in the energy region of interest , while the pole for the @xmath0 is obviously out of the scale of the physics of the resonance .",
    "this result indicates that the @xmath1 may require some cdd pole contribution , whereas the @xmath0 does not .",
    "next we consider the idealized situation of purely dynamical components , which can be obtained by adopting the wt term with the natural subtraction constant .",
    "the pole positions in this model are shown by crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole ] .",
    "note that in chiral dynamics the @xmath0 is described as the two poles in the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "these poles can be compared with the those in the phenomenological amplitude shown by the triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole ] , which corresponds to the physical resonances .",
    "the phenomenologically extracted poles for the @xmath0 ( triangles ) appear near the dynamical ones ( crosses ) .",
    "this indicates the dominance of the meson - baryon component in the @xmath0 . on the other hand , the pole for the @xmath1 moves to the higher energy when we use the natural values .",
    "although the dynamical component generates a state by itself , the physical @xmath1 requires some more contributions , which is expressed as the pole in the effective interaction at 1.7 gev .",
    "thus , the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole ] also indicates the dynamical nature of the @xmath0 and the sizable cdd pole contribution for the @xmath1 .",
    "pole positions of the meson - baryon scattering amplitudes .",
    "the crosses denote the pole positions in the natural renormalization with the wt interaction ( dynamical component ) ; the triangles stand for the pole positions with the phenomenological amplitude . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the poles for the @xmath0 in the @xmath33 scattering amplitude , and @xmath45 is the pole for the @xmath1 in the @xmath35 amplitude.,width=302 ]",
    "we have studied the structure of baryon resonances in chiral dynamics .",
    "it is shown that the cdd pole contribution can be excluded from the loop function in the natural renormalization scheme . a methodology to study the origin of the resonance",
    "is discussed using the effective interaction kernel in the natural renormalization scheme , which is obtained in comparison with the phenomenological amplitude .",
    "we analyze the origin of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 in meson - baryon scattering . in the natural renormalization scheme",
    ", the physical @xmath0 can be well reproduced with the wt interaction for the kernel of the scattering equation , while the @xmath1 requires a substantial contribution in addition to the wt term , especially a pole singularity at around 1.7 gev .",
    "these facts indicate that the @xmath1 may not be a pure dynamical state and it requires substantial cdd pole contribution in its structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 can be mainly described by a dynamical state of the meson - baryon scattering .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with the analysis of the @xmath46 scaling  @xcite and the estimation of the electromagnetic size  @xcite .",
