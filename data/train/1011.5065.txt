    "although both relay channels and interference channels are fundamental building blocks for constructing multiuser networks , their single - letter capacity characterization has been open for decades . in @xcite , instead of struggling to find the exact capacity utilizing complicated achievable schemes , the authors show that a simple han  kobayashi scheme can achieve the capacity of the two - user gaussian interference channel to within @xmath0 bit / sec / hz for all values of the channel parameters .    in @xcite , this approach is further developed and generalized .",
