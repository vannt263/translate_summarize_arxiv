    "the handedness concept , as a measure of the initial state polarization , was first discussed in papers of o.  nachtman and a.  v.  efremov @xcite . in particular , it was suggested that the polarization of the initial parton could be established by investigating the characteristics of the corresponding jet @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal polarization of quark created in @xmath4 annihilation , arises due to the interference between vector and axial amplitudes of the @xmath5-boson intermediate state .",
    "however , the correlation between quark polarization and jet handedness is expected to be greatly reduced when averaging over final phase space because of the complicated process of jet fragmentation .",
    "so in this case one can expect the effect to be of the order of 2 - 3% , making its experimental study an elaborate task .",
    "in this paper we consider the similar correlation in a much simpler case of @xmath4 annihilation into four pions at intermediate energies .",
    "it allows one to study the most probable mechanism of the handedness generation , namely , the wide resonance imaginary phase contribution . the quantity ( handedness ) @xmath6 where l , r are the numbers of the left handed and right handed configurations constructed from the two pions 3-momenta and the beam direction , is not zero when electron and positron beams are longitudinally polarized ( it turns out that the effect is also present in the case when only one of the beams is polarized .",
    "we suggest to choosing the same charge sign pions for the @xmath7 channel and arrange them according to their momenta , while any pair of pions can be taken for the @xmath8 channel .",
    "note that for @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions the handedness effect is absent @xmath11 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in these cases we actually have only one amplitude and can therefore measure only the symmetrical part of the initial state spin - density matrix .    in the case of four pions production",
    "we have two types of amplitudes which depend differently on the initial polarization and the interference between them just gives the helicity - dependent term .",
    "note that this interference term is due to the nonzero width of the @xmath12-meson in some intermediate state and the large value of this width suggests that the considerable effect could be expected .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath0 cross section goes from the annihilation channel . using the vector dominance model ,",
    "the corresponding matrix element can be presented as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the initial state positron and electron chiralities and @xmath15 is the conserved current : @xmath16 which describes the @xmath17 transition .",
