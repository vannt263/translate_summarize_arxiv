    "quantum communication @xcite promises means of information transfer that are classically impossible . for instance , superdense coding , first proposed by bennett and wiesner @xcite , allows alice to send bob two bits of classical information by the physical transfer of a single encoded qubit employing prior maximal entanglement associated with a bell state @xmath1 . at the heart of such quantum superiority is quantum coherence of both the systems where information resides , and the operations that process information .",
    "however , real systems and processors can never be perfectly isolated from the surrounding world .",
    "environmental influences always result in loss of coherence , or decoherence @xcite . in order to formulate effective strategies to address these issues in quantum communication ,",
    "it is imperative to have a complete understanding of the effects of decoherence on protocols such as superdense coding .",
    "a step in this direction was taken by bose , _ et al . _ @xcite and bowen @xcite , who considered the case where the initial pairs of qubits being used for superdense coding are in a non - maximally entangled mixed state @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , bowen derived the classical information capacity of superdense coding , through a noiseless channel , using arbitrary mixed states of two qubits . if alice and bob share pairs of qubits in the state @xmath3 , and alice is restricted to using unitary operators and sending her message as a product state of letters , then the classical information capacity of superdense coding is given by @xcite @xmath4 = 1 + s[\\chi_b ] - s[\\chi_{ab}],\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 = -{\\rm tr}[\\rho\\log_2\\rho]$ ] denotes the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath7 .",
    "this is attainable using _ special dense coding _",
    "@xmath8 , where alice encodes a message by applying to her qubits unitary transformations from the set @xmath9 of the two - dimensional identity and three pauli operators , with equal a priori probabilities of @xmath10 .",
    "the pauli operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath11 = 2i\\epsilon_{lmn}\\sigma_l$ ] .    in refs.@xcite ,",
    "presumably the non - maximally entangled mixed state @xmath2 is a result of transmission noise , described by @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , alice could have prepared pairs of qubits in a maximally entangled bell state @xmath1 at time @xmath13 and send one qubit from each pair to bob via a noisy quantum channel .",
    "if it takes time @xmath14 for the qubit to reach bob , we have @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is supposed that alice sends her encoded qubits to bob via a noiseless channel .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that alice s encoding operations are perfect unitary ones .",
    "the aim of these work is to study in what way the capacity to do superdense coding depend on the degree of entanglement of @xmath2 . to this end",
    "these assumptions may be justifiable , but they certainly do not hold in reality . as a matter of fact ,",
    "one of us has recently shown how noisy quantum operations could totally destroy entanglement in a finite time @xcite .",
    "this work is inspired by that of yu and eberly @xcite , where it has been shown that even under ideally weak phase and amplitude noise the entanglement associated with a generic class of entangled states goes abruptly to zero in a finite time and remains zero thereafter .",
    "this phenomenon , called  entanglement sudden death \" ( esd ) @xcite , has recently been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is shown , in ref.@xcite , that transmission noise together with noisy quantum operations may render an initially maximally entangled bell state useless for standard teleportation @xcite , even though the channel state shared between alice and bob was entangled before alice s bell measurement .",
    "this is thus obviously different from esd . in the light of these developments ,",
    "it is worthwhile to analyze how other quantum communication protocols , like superdense coding , are affected by environmental effects during transmission , decoding , encoding , etc .",
    "we focus on special dense coding @xmath8 in this paper .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide a detailed study of environmental effects on entanglement .",
    "firstly , we show how in the presence of quantum noises generated by non - commuting lindblad operators , the entanglement associated with a maximally entangled bell state may suffer sudden death .",
    "then , we show that esd may also occur when a bell state is under the action of a quantum operation generated by a hamiltonian in the presence of a quantum noise , provided that the hamiltonian does not commute with the corresponding lindblad operator . in section iii",
    ", a sketch of realistic special dense coding together with a brief review of holevo function is given .",
    "these set the stage for the presentation of our further results in section iv .",
    "firstly , we show how when environmental influences during transmission alone are capable of causing esd , they may result in a bell state losing its capacity for @xmath0 before esd occurs .",
    "next , we show that alice s noisy encoding operations alone could also yield an equally devastating impact on @xmath0 .",
    "these results are in contrast to those for standard teleportation @xcite , and clearly justify our investigation .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "under the assumption that the environment is markovian , the state @xmath7 of an open system evolves according to a quantum master equation @xcite @xmath16 + \\sum_k\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma_k(2l_k\\rho l^{\\dagger}_k - l^{\\dagger}_kl_k\\rho - \\rho l^{\\dagger}_kl_k).\\ ] ] here , we set @xmath17 .",

    "we analyze the effects of noise and noisy operations on the entanglement of @xmath1 . for a two - qubit system @xmath23 ,",
    "it is well - known that a necessary and sufficient condition for separability is that a matrix , obtained by partial transposition of its density operator , has non - negative eigenvalue(s ) @xcite . as a measure of the amount of entanglement associated with a given two - qubit state @xmath24",

    "we find at time @xmath31 : @xmath32 it follows that @xmath33 = e^{-2\\gamma_3t_0}$ ] . under the influence of a phase noise ,",
    "the entanglement of @xmath1 decays smoothly and asymptotically exponentially to zero .",
    "it does not reach zero in a finite time . in an interesting paper @xcite , huang and",
    "zhu showed that to observe esd under dephasing , an entangled two - qubit density operator should have nonzero diagonal elements .",
    "we show below how this insight throws light on esd discussed in refs.@xcite .",

    "clearly , @xmath38 = e^{-2\\gamma_1t_0}$ ] .",
    "so , under the influence of a bit - flip noise , the entanglement of @xmath1 decays smoothly and asymptotically exponentially to zero , in exactly the same manner as when it is under the influence of a phase noise .",
    "this can be understood from the facts that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are eigenvectors of @xmath41 , and that @xmath42 can also be similarly expressed in terms of the eigenvectors @xmath43 of @xmath44 : @xmath45 therefore , to the state @xmath1 , a bit - flip noise is like a phase noise .",
    "such freedom is lost in the presence of both bit - flip and phase noise .",
    "consequently , we find a dramatically different effect when we subject @xmath1 simultaneously to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting state @xmath48 can be obtained by solving @xmath36 +                      \\gamma_3[(\\sigma_0 \\otimes \\sigma_3)\\rho(\\sigma_0 \\otimes \\sigma_3 ) - \\rho].\\ ] ] assuming for simplicity , @xmath49 from here on , @xmath50 has negativity @xcite @xmath51 = \\max\\left\\{0 , \\frac{1}{2}[(1 + e^{-2\\gamma t_0})^2 - 2]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the entanglement suffers sudden death in a finite time @xmath52 .",

    "this is supported by the fact that @xmath54 with @xmath47 gives exactly the same result , eq.([mu ] ) .",
    "we call noises that are generated by non - commuting operators non - commuting .",
    "lastly , we note that the depolarizing noise @xcite , which is generated by @xmath44 , @xmath55 , and @xmath41 , may thus cause esd .",
    "in fact , subjecting one of the particles in @xmath1 to a depolarizing noise yields a state with negativity given by @xmath56 .",

    "but , for @xmath1 , @xmath47 and @xmath71 do not result in esd despite the fact that they do not commute . they produce a state with negativity given by @xmath79/2 $ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the result in @xcite , since @xmath47 and @xmath71 acting on @xmath1 do not produce a state with nonzero diagonal elements .",
    "so , non - commutativity between the lindblad generators is a necessary but not sufficient condition for @xmath1 to suffer esd .",
    "however , in realistic superdense coding , we will encounter the following state @xmath80 which suffers esd .",
    "its negativity is given by @xmath81 and becomes zero at @xmath82 that can be obtained from a solution of @xmath83 we have @xmath84 .",
    "single - qubit rotations are essential to quantum information processing . here , we consider hamiltonians given by @xmath85 , which generates an anticlockwise coherent rotation of a qubit about the @xmath86-axis at the rate @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 describes rather generically the dynamics of two - level systems .",
    "for example , it could describe an electron spin in an external magnetic field , or it could describe a two - level atom in a light field . from the above insights we expect , for instance , @xmath1 to suffer esd when it is under the action of @xmath89 or @xmath90 in the presence of noise generated by @xmath91 . here , @xmath92 .",

    "we find the entanglement of @xmath96 goes to zero in a finite time @xmath97 , which is a solution of @xmath98 here , @xmath99 .",
    "we observe that for a fixed @xmath100 , interestingly @xmath97 decreases with increasing @xmath87 . and , in the limit of large @xmath87 , @xmath101 .",

    "this is consistent with the conclusions at the end of subsection c.    in summary , noisy quantum operations that result from non - commuting hamiltonian and lindblad operator could have an equally devastating effect on the entanglement of @xmath1 as non - commuting noises .",
    "the consequence of these results in @xmath8 will be discussed after we briefly review realistic special dense coding in the following section .",
    "suppose alice communicates some classical information with bob using `` alphabet '' states @xmath107 with probabilities @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the average number of bits of classical information alice can convey to bob per transmission of an alphabet state is bounded from above by the holevo function @xcite @xmath109 = s[x ] - \\sum_ip_is[x_i],\\ ] ] where @xmath110 .",
    "this bound can be achieved in the limit of an infinite ensemble by appropriate block coding at alice s end and appropriate measurements at bob s end @xcite .      throughout section iv , we suppose alice prepares pairs of qubits in the state @xmath1 at time @xmath13 .",
    "she then sends one of each pair of qubits via a noisy channel @xmath12 , which reaches bob in time @xmath14 .",
    "in realistic special dense coding , alice and bob therefore initially share pairs of entangled qubits in some mixed state @xmath15 . during this process , we assume alice s other qubit is well shielded from environmental influences .",
    "after @xmath2 has been established , alice generates the following four letter states with equal probability : @xmath111 where @xmath112 indicates the type of environmental noise affecting the transmissions and encoding operations @xcite .",
    "we assume bob s qubits are well isolated throughout alice s noisy encoding .",
    "for @xmath113 , the qubits are perfectly isolated since no operations need to be performed on alice s qubit",
    ". the environment will only affect alice s qubit during a nontrivial quantum operation .",
    "lastly , alice sends her encoded qubits to bob , which for simplicity we suppose is done via the same noisy channel @xmath12 in time @xmath14 . by so doing , alice is essentially commnicating with bob using the alphabet states @xmath114 as separate letters . the number of bits she can communicate with bob using this procedure is thus bounded by the holevo function , @xmath115 = s[x ] - \\frac{1}{4}\\sum^3_{m = 0}s[x_m],\\ ] ] where @xmath116 .",
    "we stress that only when a qubit is being manipulated ( rotated or transmitted ) , then it will be affected by the environment .",
    "otherwise , the qubits are assumed to be perfectly isolated .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that bob s joint measurements necessary to decode alice s message are perfect and do not result in further loss in information to the environment .",

    "this is the ideal classical information capacity of superdense coding @xcite . in the following section",
    ", we present our analysis of the impact of non - commuting noises and noisy encoding operations on @xmath0 .",
    "for clarity we consider noisy transmission and noisy encoding separately , before discussing the cases where both transmission and encoding are noisy . in subsections",
    "a and b , alice s encoding operations are ideal and unitary , but the qubits are sent via noisy pauli channels .",
    "we find that when environmental influences are capable of causing esd in @xmath1 , they may result in @xmath1 losing its capacity to do dense coding before esd . from the results in section ii we know that noisy pauli rotations could also lead to esd in @xmath1 .",
    "these operations are basic to @xmath8 .",
    "we show , in subsection c , that alice s noisy encoding operations alone could indeed result in an equally devastating impact on @xmath8 .",
    "these results are in contrast to those for standard teleportation @xcite , and the implications will be briefly discussed in subsection b.      alice establishes the shared entangled state @xmath2 with bob via a dephasing channel , i.e. , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it follows that @xmath124 note that since @xmath47 and @xmath91 give the same @xmath125 , namely eq.([diag0 ] ) , we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "a thorough understanding of all possible environmental effects , especially on quantum communication and computation , is obviously vital",
    ". we would then be able to formulate effective strategies to overcome the challenges due to these detrimental effects . in this paper , we have shown how besides non - commuting lindblad operators , a hamiltonian together with a non - commuting lindblad operator produces a noisy quantum operation that could totally destroy the entanglement of a bell state in a finite time .",
    "more importantly , we have shown that when two quantum noises are capable of causing esd in a bell state , the resulting state becomes useless for @xmath0 before esd occurs .",
    "we have also shown that when alice s encoding operations are noisy a bell state may fail to yield information transfer better than classically possible . this can be accounted for by the fact that these operations could cause esd in a bell state .",
    "these results are clearly in contrast to those in ref.@xcite .",
    "we hope our finding will stimulate more complete and realistic studies on quantum information protocols under the influence of noise ."
