    "however incommensurate inelastic neutron scattering signals ( widely interpreted as evidence for dynamical stripe fluctuations ) have been found in both lsco and yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) compounds with a remarkably similar phenomenology .",
    "@xcite even more static charge order has been found in ybco without the need for additions like nd .",
    "@xcite    in lsco the inverse stripe spacing grows linearly with doping @xmath7 up to @xmath8 and the orientation rotates from vertical ( i.e. oriented along the cu - o bonds ) by @xmath9 to diagonal for concentrations lower @xmath10 .",

    "the existence of incommensurate scattering in biscco is also supported by the experiments of ref . .",

    "all these experiments suggest that stripes are a common phenomena of all cuprates families and therefore may be related to superconductivity .    concerning the theoretical aspects , stripes",

    "@xcite however these pioneering studies predicted insulating stripes with a linear density of @xmath14 added holes per lattice constant along the stripe ( instead of @xmath15 ) which led to an early rejection of stripes .",

    "the complexity of the three band model , however , makes it difficult to perform such study . to achieve our goals",
    "we adopt here a much simpler hamiltonian , namely the extended one - band hubbard model .",

    "regarding the material dependence it has been proposed recently@xcite that a one - band model description of the various cuprate families essentially differs in the ratio between next - nearest and nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 .",
    "in fact it is found that the transition temperature scales with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath18 for the lsco single layer compound up to @xmath19 for the tl and hg based materials .",
    "we show that this parameter plays a key role for the stability and electronic structure of the stripes suggesting a possible connection between stripes and superconductivity .",
    "in particular the higher the @xmath20 the smaller is the optimum filling @xmath21 of the stripe ( fig .  [ nuopt ] ) .",
    "additionally we present a thorough comparison of the stability of stripe and polaron textures upon varying @xmath0 .    the influence of a next - nearest neighbor hopping term on the stripe formation has been previously investigated by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite and the hf approximation .",
    "@xcite it was found @xcite that increasing the ratio @xmath22 leads to a suppression of static stripes .",

    "for technical aspects of this variational procedure we refer to ref . .",
    "the clusters investigated in the following have dimensions @xmath40 up to @xmath41 and we use periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in order to stabilize homogeneous ( metallic ) stripe textures .",
    "in fig .  [ rdx ] we report the typical charge- and spin profiles in a cut perpendicular to the stripe for vertical site ( sc ) and bond ( bc ) centered stripes as computed with hf and ga respectively .",
    "all vertical stripe solutions investigated in this paper are metallic ( i.e. homogeneous along the stripe ) except for integer @xmath21 and we have suppressed 1-d instabilities by choosing appropriate boundary conditions ( i.e. periodic or antiperiodic in direction of the stripes ) .",
    "the total charge shows dips at the central site ( sites ) of the antiphase sc ( bc ) domain walls ( fig .",
    "[ rdx]a , d ) corresponding to the accumulation of holes . as also found in previous studies @xcite the ga charge modulation is much weaker as compared to hf .    due to symmetry of the antiphase domain",
    "walls the spin density is zero along the stripe in case of sc stripes ( fig .",
    "[ rdx]a - c ) . therefore a large charge reduction is the only possibility to reduce the hf double occupancy on these sites . on the other hand",
    "the double occupancy within the ga can be separately tuned by the variational parameter @xmath38 leading to a smaller charge modulation amplitude with respect to hf . in fig .",
    "[ rdx]c we show the smaller double occupancy at the core stripes sites ( like site 2 ) for the ga whereas both hf and ga acquire approximately the same value within the af ordered regions . in contrast , the bc stripe solution has finite spin polarization on all sites ( fig .",

    "[ rdx]f ) .",
    "this has important consequences for the respective stability of bc and sc stripes within the two approximations as we will see below .     and @xmath42 half - filled stripes on a @xmath41 lattice corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath44.,width=302 ]      in order to understand the role of @xmath20 in the context of stripe formation we proceed by investigating the influence of this parameter on the electronic structure . within our variational ( mean - field )",

    "[ bands]b ) displays a gap between both bands which is due to a af spin - density modulation along the bc stripe . for both , sc and bc stripes , fig .",
    "[ bands ] reveals a significant broadening of the active band upon increasing @xmath54 .",
    "this broadening has a strong influence on the kinetic energy of holes in the stripe and therefore also on the density of states at the fermi energy and , as we will show below , on the value of the optimum @xmath21 .",
    "the broadening can be understood by looking at the single particle wave functions ( wf ) of selected k - points of the active band as shown in fig .",
    "[ amp ] for the case of sc stripes .",
    "the @xmath55 wf is characterized by having opposite sign at the core of the stripe than on the adjacent ( af ordered ) legs . as a consequence a positive next - nearest neighbor hopping ( i.e. negative @xmath20 , cf . eq .",
    "( [ hm ] ) ) leads to a lowering of this state in first order perturbation theory . by the same argument",
    "one can show that the zone boundary state of the active band is not affected by @xmath20 since next - nearest neighbor hopping along the stripe always connects to a site @xmath30 with a node in the single particle wave function ( the shift in energy in fig .",
    "[ bands ] is due to the fact that @xmath56 shifts downwards with @xmath20 ) . for a sizeable sdw gap @xmath45 on the adjacent legs of the stripe the broadening of the active band can be evaluated as @xmath57 . since @xmath58 as already mentioned above , the @xmath20 band width renormalization is expected to be larger in the ga as compared to hf .",
    "for completeness we mention that similar considerations also hold for the upper band in the mott - hubbard gap . from the structure of the @xmath59 wave - function ( cf .",
    "[ bands ] ) it turns out that a negative @xmath20 induces a shift of this state to lower energies ( in fig .",
    "[ bands ] this shift is almost compensated by the change in the chemical potential ) .",
    "correspondingly we find a narrowing of the upper band @xmath60 which for large @xmath20 leads to the flat structure as observed in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .      to determine the more stable solution among different textures we need to compare the total energies per atom , @xmath62 , for the same doping , @xmath63 .",
    "equivalently we can compare the excess energy per hole with respect to the undoped antiferromagnet ( af ) , hereafter the `` energy per hole '' : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total energy of the inhomogeneous state ( generally a stripe state ) with @xmath66 holes counted from half - filling and @xmath67 is the af solution on the same cluster .",
    "the minimum of @xmath61 at low doping ( non - interacting stripes ) has the following meaning : it determines the optimum filling that stripes should have in order to accommodate a given number of holes in a variable number of stripes .    in fig .",
    "[ ehhf ] we report the energies per hole for different configurations in the hf and in the ga approximations as a function of the stripe filling @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 is the linear dimension in the @xmath49 direction of the cluster which coincides with the stripe length , @xmath70 denotes the number of stripes and @xmath66 is the total number of holes ( counted from half - filling ) in the system .",
    "more detailed results for vertical sc and diagonal stripes in the ga are reported in fig .",
    "[ d35fig ] .    in order to analyze these results",
    "we expand the excess energy per unit length as a taylor series in @xmath21 : @xmath71 the energy per hole in a stripe thus follows the relation @xmath72 which provides an excellent fit to the data points as shown in figs .",
    "[ ehhf]b , [ d35fig ] .",
    "the minimum of @xmath61 is given by @xmath73 and the second derivative of the energy per hole at the minimum reads as @xmath74 note , however , that the single particle spectrum has a gap for @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the energy has a cusp - like singularity at this filling which causes the @xmath14 state to be the minimum for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we can take this into account by modifying the above formula to : @xmath75 in the dilute limit , corresponding to large stripe separation , the coefficients can be interpreted as follows : @xmath76 is the energy cost per unit length to create an antiphase domain wall in the _ stoichiometric _ ( otherwise af ordered ) system .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 can be defined as the chemical potential to add one hole into the `` empty '' stripe .",
    "finally the parameter @xmath78 is related to the kinetic ( @xmath79 ) and interaction ( @xmath80 ) energy of the system .    in order to separate the two contributions @xmath79 , @xmath80 to the parameter @xmath81",
    "we have adopted the following procedure . for a small value of @xmath21",
    "we have optimized the variational parameters of the ga .",
    "then the energy as a function of @xmath21 has been computed _ without _ changing the variational parameters , i.e. by solely filling the frozen bands .",
    "the resulting quadratic contribution to the energy gives the @xmath79 parameter and since @xmath81 is known we also obtain @xmath80 . within mean - field",
    "the latter is due to readjustments of the charges and double occupancies in response to the added holes .    for the parameters under consideration we find that @xmath80 is approximately @xmath82 times larger than @xmath79 .",
    "however , it is important to note that @xmath80 is almost independent from the next - nearest neighbor hopping , whereas from fig .",
    "[ bands ] it is obvious that the kinetic energy of the holes moving along the stripe will have a significant dependence on @xmath20 . to see",
    "more explicitly how the active bandwith reflects on the kinetic energy one can approximate the active band density of states per spin by a rectangular shape of height @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 represents an effective bandwith which is roughly given by the width of the lower ( active ) band in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "one finds that the kinetic energy is quadratic in @xmath21 and @xmath85 .",
    "below we discuss in detail how @xmath20 determines the stability of stripes via this mechanism .     for vertical stripes as a function of the stripe filling @xmath21 and for various values of @xmath0 .",

    "the lines correspond to fits obtained with eq .",
    "( [ ehnu]),width=302 ]    to estimate @xmath76 we need an estimate of the energy to create an empty domain wall . since this is related to an excitation of the undoped system we can use the heisenberg model with a magnetic interaction @xmath89 in the limit of @xmath90 .",
    "the estimate is easily done in the case of bc stripes which have a core with ferromagnetic alignment along the domain wall . in the nel limit one",
    "obtains : @xmath91 .",
    "the case of sc stripes is more subtle .",
    "indeed for sc stripes one has a core without permanent moments which , contrary to the bc case , does not have a classical analog within a heisenberg description of the undoped state .",
    "a non classical state will consist of a spin liquid along the core which in any case will give @xmath92 . within the hf approximation of the hubbard model the corresponding solution",
    "has a non - magnetic core with maximum double occupancy ( 1/4 ) .",
    "this is at odds with the heisenberg picture of a spin liquid core which , by construction , implies small double occupancy for the original fermions .",
    "therefore the hf approximation introduces an error in @xmath76 which in the large @xmath32 limit is of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "this is due to the fact that moment formation is the only mechanism within hf to reduce double occupancy . on the other hand",
    "the ga allows an unpolarized state with small double occupancy ( @xmath94 ) thanks to the additional variational parameters @xmath36 as shown in fig .",
    "[ rdx]c , f . due to this mechanism",
    "we obtain @xmath76 within the ga of the correct order @xmath95 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ ehhf ] that the curves for sc and bc stripes are similar in the ga whereas in hf metallic sc stripes are energetically unfavorable with respect to bc ( and diagonal ) ones .",
    "clearly the latter faultiness of the hf approach is due to the overestimation of the parameter @xmath76 mentioned above [ c.f .",
    "eq .  [ numin ] ] which leads to an unphysical large value of @xmath96 .",
    "for this reason we conclude that hf theory is not an adequate approach for the description of sc stripes .    within the hf approximation it is known @xcite that for @xmath97 vertical stripes",
    "are less stable than diagonal ones .",
    "moreover spin polarons become the ground state when @xmath98 . fig .",
    "[ ehhf]a demonstrates that similar results hold when one includes next - nearest neighbor hopping . as we will show below the situation",
    "is quite different in the ga approximation which also allows a comparison between sc and bc stripes on an equal footing .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ ehhf]b that within the gutzwiller approach sc stripes become degenerate with bc for large _ and _ small filling factors @xmath21 .",
    "especially it turns out that bc empty stripes are slightly lower in energy than sc empty stripes .",
    "however , sc stripes tend to have larger bandwith than bc ones ( cf .",
    "[ bands ] ) which leads to a larger @xmath81 , larger curvatures of @xmath61 vs. @xmath21 [ eq .  ( [ e2dnu ] ) ] and hence smaller values of @xmath21 .",
    "the difference in curvature allows for the two intersections between the @xmath61 curves for bc and sc solutions in fig .",
    "we will show below that the crossing at large @xmath21 corresponds to optimal doping and that in the underdoped case sc stripes are more stable than bc ones . the stability of sc solutions with respect to bc ones at low doping as well as the increased degeneracy for larger concentration is in agreement with dmft calculations in the one - band model .",
    "@xcite therefore it seems to be a robust feature of the model and not to depend on the approximation .",
    "on the other hand it is opposite to what is observed in the 3-band model@xcite where bc stripes constitute the most stable low doping structure .",
    "we now proceed to discuss in detail the role of @xmath20 on @xmath61 . due to the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath20 and the constancy of the parameter @xmath76 we observe in fig .",
    "[ d35fig ] a shift of optimal stripe filling to smaller values and a steeper minimum upon increasing @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the larger is @xmath54 the more stable are partially filled stripes with respect to their filled ( insulating ) counterpart in agreement with the estimate @xmath99 and eq .",
    "( [ numin ] ) .",
    "one can understand the reason for this behavior by comparing the two cases @xmath14 ( insulating ) and @xmath100 ( metallic ) , remembering that the former structure has twice as much holes per stripe .",
    "for the sake of simplicity let us neglect for the moment the interaction part @xmath80 . then",
    ", if the cost to create a stripe dominates ( @xmath101 or roughly speaking @xmath102 ) , @xmath14 stripes are more convenient because this minimizes the number of stripes that have to be created to accommodate a given number of holes . on the other hand for @xmath14 the pauli exclusion principle forces to fill the higher kinetic energy states of the active band , which for broad bands becomes energetically unfavorable . as a consequence it is more convenient for systems with broad bands ( @xmath103 ) to pay the energy @xmath104 in order to create more stripes , thus reducing the filling per stripe and avoiding the occupancy of high kinetic energy states of the active band .",
    "clearly the relevant parameter which controls this behavior is @xmath105 with small ratio @xmath106 favoring partially filled stripes in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ numin ] ) ( see also fig .",
    "[ nuopt ] below ) .",
    "we note that this is in agreement with our findings in the three - band hubbard model where the role of @xmath20 was played by the oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "@xcite     for vertical sc ( a ) and diagonal ( b ) stripes as a function of the stripe filling @xmath21 and for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "the stripe separation ( in lattice constants ) is @xmath107 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "we also report the energy of the polaron solutions in the right panel.,width=264 ]    the energy of ( vertical ) metallic stripes has to be compared with other saddle - points of the ga energy functional .",
    "it should be noted that especially at large doping ( but depending also on @xmath0 ) there exists a huge variety of inhomogeneous charge and spin textures which are rather close in energy and compete with the vertical stripe solution . among this variety",
    "we have selected diagonal stripes and spin polarons which energy per hole is reported in fig .",
    "[ d35fig]b .",
    "this choice is motivated by the idea that with increasing kinetic energy the stripes should undergoe some kind of melting process which reflects in substantial lateral and orientiational fluctuations and an eventual decay into individual segments . however , in our static approach we can only access some snapshot configurations of this melting process and demonstrate the increased degeneracy in energy of these structures with doping .    two major points result from fig . [ d35fig ] : _ i _ ) for fixed stripe periodicity @xmath17 vertical solutions are in general lower in energy than diagonal ones .",

    "for smaller distances stripes start to repel , resulting in a shift of @xmath61 to higher values ( cf .",
    "[ d35fig]a ) . however , the increased inter - stripe interaction leads also to a larger dispersion perpendicular to the stripes which in the @xmath61 curves of fig .",
    "[ d35fig ] reflects as an increase in curvature ( i.e. in the kinetic constant c ) upon going from @xmath43 to @xmath116 stripes . as a result one",

    "the situation for diagonal stripes is qualitatively similar , i.e. upon increasing @xmath22 the minimum of @xmath61 shifts to lower values of @xmath21 .",
    "since the kinetic energy in diagonal direction ( and thus the parameter @xmath117 ) is naturally smaller than along the bonds we find the optimal filling at larger values as compared to vertical stripes .",

    "[ finfig ] reports the corresponding @xmath61 curves but now plotted as a function of the hole doping .",
    "since the charge modulation of vertical stripes has a width of about 4 - 5 lattice constants the inter - stripe interaction is vanishingly small for @xmath121 and thus the energy depends only weakly on distance .",

    "@xcite    in the low doping regime neutron scattering experiments on lsco observe a change of the incommensurability vector below @xmath10 from the vertical to the diagonal direction .",
    "@xcite from the results as shown in fig .",
    "[ finfig ] we can not infer a crossover towards diagonal solutions at low doping .",
    "however , the closeness in energy of vertical and diagonal structures suggests that the orthorombic distortion , which continuously increases upon underdoping in lsco may lead to a stabilization of the diagonal stripe phase at small hole concentrations ( see normand et al .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the relation between stripe orientation and lattice distortion ) .",
    "moreover , we believe that other effects , not included in our model , are important in this regard . indeed the contribution of long - range coulomb interactions is expected to become important at low doping .",
    "a point charge estimate shows that this tends to favor diagonal configurations over vertical ones .    to summarize the results for @xmath131",
    ": we obtain half - filled vertical stripes and @xmath132 up to hole concentrations @xmath44 and increasing @xmath21 and @xmath126 for @xmath133 in agreement with experiment@xcite and with our previous 3-band computations .",
    "@xcite the behavior for the filling implies that the chemical potential @xmath134 will be approximately constant for @xmath135 and decrease with doping for @xmath136 which is also supported by experiment .",
    "@xcite however , it should be noted that the theoretically obtained shift in @xmath134 exceeds the experimental one by a factor of @xmath137 which may be attributed to finite size effects .",
    "a similar discrepancy is also observed in the 3-band model and we refer to ref . for a further discussion of this point .     as appropriate for lsco .",
    "the inset displays the incommensurability versus doping as deduced from ( a ) .",
    "the diagonal pattern indicates the degeneracy with diagonal stripes.,width=264 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ finfig2 ] we show the phase diagram calculated for @xmath138 which is considered to be the appropriate ratio for the tl@xmath4ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath139 and hgba@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath140 compounds .",
    "@xcite in this case low doping vertical stripes have a filling fraction of @xmath141 so that the incommensurability @xmath142 is expected to grow faster than for the lsco compounds .",
    "however , already the @xmath43 structures are unstable with respect to the spin polaron solution and thus the incommensurability starts to saturate for @xmath143 corresponding to the @xmath86 structure .",
    "moreover since the polaron solution is rather close in energy a static stripe phase is quite unlikely to exist in tl- ( hg- ) based cuprates .",
    "it is rather more meaningful to have in mind a picture where stripes appear as snapshots in the dynamical evolution of the system . in this context",
    "it is interesting to observe that for all dopings diagonal stripes are higher in energy than the polaron structure .",
    "the low doping phase may resemble that of a stripe nematic @xcite where orientational symmetry is broken but quantum fluctuations mainly lead to a restoration of translational symmetry .     as appropriate for bi2212 .",
    "the inset displays the incommensurability versus doping as deduced from ( a).,width=264 ]",
    "within the inhomogeneous ga we have investigated metallic stripe states in the one - band extended hubbard model for a fixed value of the on - site repulsion @xmath33 as appropriate for the cuprates .",
    "metallic stripes were shown to be favored by a negative @xmath0 and the physics of this behavior has been clarified in terms of the competition between the kinetic energy along the stripe and the creation energy of a stripe . in this regard",
    "the hf approximation has been shown to lead to gross quantitative and often qualitative errors .",
    "generally the present results are in agreement with our previous findings in the 3-band model , in particular the behavior of the incommensurability and the chemical potential , showing that our previous results in the 3-band model are quite robust@xcite .",
    "on the other hand there are also important differences . in the present model sc stripes are more stable at low doping as compared to bc stripes .",
    "this is in agreement with dmft computations@xcite and therefore seems to be a robust feature of the one - band model and not to depend on the approximation",
    ".    one should keep in mind that effective models , like the one - band hubbard model , are in principle designed for the description of electronic excitations in a diluted , uniform phase .",
    "usually it is not guaranteed that they will give correct results when one compares the relative stability of dense non - uniform phases .",
    "@xcite therefore we consider the 3-band result for the stripe state symmetry as more reliable for the description of real cuprates than the one - band calculation .",
    "further support to this conclusion comes from the analysis of transport data .",
    "@xcite indeed within the 3-band hamiltonian where bc stripes constitute the most stable low doping state we have explained@xcite an anomalous vanishing of the transport coefficients@xcite as due to the particular band structure of bc stripes which turns out to be particle - hole symmetric close to the fermi level . since the band structure of half - filled sc stripes is not particle - hole symmetric around the fermi level ( cf",
    "[ bands ] ) the one - band model can not account for the observed vanishing of transport coefficients .",
    "@xcite    when the next - nearest neighbor hopping is fixed to @xmath131 stripes turn out to be half - filled at low doping .",
    "the behavior of the incommensurability and chemical potential is in good agreement with experiment in lsco .",
    "our investigation therefore supports the lda based one band - mapping of ref .   where a similar value for the next - nearest neighbor hopping has been reported for lsco materials .",
    "as doping increases the energy becomes independent of the charge topology .",
    "sc vertical , bc vertical , diagonal stripes and a polaron lattice all become degenerate .",
    "we associate this with a transition from a state with orientational order to an isotropic state .",
    "@xcite this quantum melting of the stripe state for @xmath130 is also reminiscent of the existence of a quantum critical point in the slightly overdoped regime as has been proposed by castellani _",
    "et al_.  @xcite    since stripes are charged the lateral motion of stripes is optically active .",
    "therefore the decrease in the energy gap between sc and bc stripes should reflect in the softening of an optically active electronic mode .",
    "we have explicitly shown this behavior in a ga+rpa computation in the three - band model where the softening of a stripe phason @xcite can explain the shift of the mid - infrared peak in optical conductivity experiments on lsco .",
    "@xcite we expect a similar behavior in the charge response of the one - band model .",
    "our present results allow for predictions for other cuprate families . for larger values of @xmath54",
    "we obtain lower values of @xmath21 . therefore according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : edx ] ) we predict a steeper curve of @xmath144 vs. @xmath7 for small @xmath7 in tl and hg based compounds . as @xmath54 increases",
    "we also find that the relative stability of stripes with respect to isolated polarons decreases .",
    "this loss of stability may indicate that stripes have a more dynamical character in these materials .",
    "having in mind the differences and similarities between the one - band and the three - band description one can still obtain very useful qualitative information from the one - band description . since within the present work we have set up the relevant parameter set and stable stripe saddle - points for the lsco compounds this represents the first step for an investigation of the associated charge and spin dynamics .",
    "furtheron the one - band model allows for the investigation of larger clusters and thus the structure of these excitations in q - space can be investigated in more detail than possible within the 3-band hamiltonian .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
