    "it was shown some time ago that some complex non - hermitian hamiltonians may exhibit real eigenvalues@xcite . the conjecture that such intriguing feature may be due to unbroken pt - symmetry@xcite gave rise to a very active field of research@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the first studied pt - symmetric models were mainly one - dimensional anharmonic oscillators@xcite and lately the focus shifted towards multidimensional problems@xcite . among the",
    "most widely studied multidimensional pt - symmetric models we mention the complex versions of the barbanis@xcite and hnon - heiles@xcite hamiltonians .",
    "several methods have been applied to the calculation of their spectra : the diagonalization method@xcite , perturbation theory@xcite , classical and semiclassical approaches@xcite , among others@xcite . typically , those models depend on a potential parameter @xmath3 so that the hamiltonian is hermitian when @xmath4 and non - hermitian when @xmath5 .",
    "bender and weir@xcite conjectured that some of those models may exhibit phase transitions so that their spectra are real for sufficiently small values of @xmath6 .",
    "such phase transitions appear to be a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "multidimensional oscillators exhibit point - group symmetry ( pgs)@xcite . as far as we know such a property has not been taken into consideration in those earlier studies of the pt - symmetric models , except for the occasional parity in one of the variables .",
    "it is more than likely that pgs may be relevant to the study of the spectra of multidimensional pt - symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "this paper is expected to be a useful contribution in that direction .",
    "the research on non - hermitian hamiltonians has been mainly focussed on finding models with real spectrum .",
    "it is our purpose to show an example of pt - symmetric hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues ; a hamiltonian with the phase transition at the hermitian limit @xmath4 .",
    "we will also show that pgs provides a simple and clear explanation of why the eigenvalues of such model are complex and not real as the other problems discussed so far .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we consider the dimensionless schrdinger equation for a particle in a square box with the potential @xmath7 that is obviously pt - symmetric . in section  [ sec : pt ] we show that perturbation theory predicts that some of the eigenvalues are complex for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : pgs ] we analyze the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed and perturbed hamiltonians from the point of view of pgs and show why some eigenvalues are expected to be complex . in section  [ sec :",
    "dm ] we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions accurately by means of the diagonalization method and confirm the conclusions of the preceding sections . in section  [ sec : model_2 ] we consider the particle in a square box with the potential @xmath8 that resembles part of the potential of the pt - symmetric version of the barbanis hamiltonian . in this case",
    "pgs shows that pt symmetry may not be broken for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the diagonalization method .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results of the paper , draw conclusions and put forward a somewhat general recipe for the appearance of complex eigenvalues in a given multidimensional non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we first consider the schrdinger equation @xmath10 with the dimensionless hamiltonian operator @xmath11 and the boundary conditions @xmath12 this hamiltonian is hermitian when @xmath3 is real and pt - symmetric when @xmath3 is imaginary .",
    "in fact , when @xmath13 , @xmath14 real , the hamiltonian is invariant under two antiunitary transformations@xcite @xmath15 generated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the time - reversal operator@xcite and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the parity transformations @xmath21    it follows from equation ( [ eq : aha = h ] ) that @xmath22 that is to say , if @xmath23 is eigenfunction of @xmath24 with eigenvalue @xmath25 then @xmath26 is eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , the same conclusion applies to @xmath28 .",
    "when pt symmetry is unbroken @xmath29 the corresponding eigenvalue is real@xcite . in a recent paper",
    "we have shown that the eigenvalue may be real even when this condition is manifestly violated@xcite . later on",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail .",
    "all the hamiltonians studied previously exhibit unbroken pt symmetry for sufficiently small values of @xmath6@xcite . in what follows",
    "we show that the model depicted above behaves in a quite different way .",
    "when @xmath4 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the simple model described in the preceding section are those of the particle in a square box @xmath30 and we appreciate that the eigenfunctions with @xmath31 are two - fold degenerate .",
    "there are accidental degeneracies that occur when @xmath32 but they are not relevant for the present discussion .",
    "for example , the three eigenfunctions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 share the same eigenvalue but only the first two ones are consequence of the symmetry of the problem .    by means of perturbation theory",
    "it is quite easy to prove that some of the eigenvalues are complex for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the perturbation correction of first order @xmath36 vanishes when @xmath37 , @xmath38 but it is nonzero if @xmath39 :    @xmath40    it is clear that for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 these levels behave approximately as linear functions of @xmath13 . in other words , the phase transition takes place at the hermitian limit @xmath41 .",
    "this result is different from that for the pt - symmetric oscillators studied so far that exhibit a vanishing perturbation correction of first order@xcite .",
    "we can understand the occurrence of complex eigenvalues more clearly from the point of view of pgs .",
    "since the model is two - dimensional its behaviour with respect to the coordinate @xmath42 is irrelevant and , consequently , the choice of the point group is not unique . for the description of the unperturbed model @xmath4 we choose the point group @xmath43 with symmetry operations @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a rotation by an angle @xmath46 around an axis perpendicular to the center of the square box ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are vertical reflection planes@xcite . for simplicity",
    "we omit the transformation of the momenta when it is similar to that of the coordinates .",
    "the eigenfunctions form bases for the irreducible representations @xmath50 as indicated below @xmath51 as expected some pairs of two - fold degenerate eigenfunctions form bases for the irreducible representation @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to it , pairs of eigenfunctions with symmetry @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) as well as @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) are also degenerate .    when @xmath5 a suitable point group is @xmath9 with symmetry operations @xmath60 and irreducible representations @xmath61 .",
    "the eigenfunctions are linear combinations of the form @xmath62 it is clear that the perturbation removes the degeneracy in such a way that the two - fold degenerate unperturbed eigenfunctions @xmath25 become the perturbed eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath57 and @xmath53 . as a result , every eigenvalue @xmath63 is the complex conjugate of an eigenvalue @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "as shown in the preceding section , the degeneracy of these levels is removed at first order of perturbation theory and it is not difficult to verify that the pair of integrals @xmath66 give us exactly the perturbation corrections in equation ( [ eq : emn(1 ) ] ) . on the other hand , the degenerate unperturbed eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath52 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath53 become the perturbed eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath52 and @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the perturbation correction of first order vanishes and the degeneracy is removed at least at second order . if , as in the case of the models studied earlier by other authors , all the perturbation corrections of odd order vanish@xcite , then we may expect real eigenvalues for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 .    pgs gives us a clear description of the occurrence of complex eigenvalues .",
    "if we take into account equation ( [ eq : haxpsi ] ) and that @xmath67 then we realize that @xmath68 . we appreciate that pt symmetry is broken for all @xmath69 and that @xmath65 as mentioned above . however , in principle it may be possible that both eigenvalues were real and degenerate as in the case of the rigid rotor studied in an earlier paper@xcite . in the present case",
    "we know that they are complex as shown in section  [ sec : pt ] .",
    "if we apply the same reasoning to the eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath52 and @xmath70 we realize that pt - symmetry may not be broken for them because @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 ) that follows from the fact that the symmetry - adapted basis functions are invariant or merely change sign under this antiunitary operation ( and also under @xmath74 ) .",
    "we can obtain sufficiently accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the box model by means of the diagonalization method .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath75 in the basis set @xmath76 gives us the lowest eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator as well as the coefficients of the expansion of the eigenfunctions in the basis set @xmath77 alternatively , we can diagonalize hamiltonian matrices @xmath78 for each of the irreducible representations @xmath79 of the point group @xmath9 and thus obtain the corresponding sets of eigenfunctions ( [ eq : pert_eigenf ] ) separately . in this case",
    "the dimension of the resulting secular equations is noticeably smaller .",
    "it is well known that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial generated by the full matrix @xmath75 are real@xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials generated by @xmath80 and @xmath81 are polynomial functions of @xmath82 and therefore real . on the other hand , the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials generated by the matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 are polynomial functions of @xmath3 and therefore complex .",
    "figure  [ fig : emn ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the first eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_model ] ) for a wide range of values of @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvalues for symmetry @xmath52 and @xmath56 are real for sufficiently small values of @xmath14 .",
    "some pairs of them coalesce at critical values @xmath85 of the coupling constant and emerge as pairs of complex numbers for @xmath86 .",
    "this occurrence of exceptional points is similar to that already found for other two - dimensional models@xcite . on the other hand , the eigenvalues for symmetry @xmath57 and @xmath53",
    "are complex for all values of @xmath87 .",
    "this kind of eigenvalues does not appear in those non - hermitian hamiltonians studied earlier .",
    "we say that the pt - symmetric hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_model ] ) exhibits a pt phase transition at the trivial hermitian limit .",
    "in order to illustrate the difference between present pt - symmetric model and those studied earlier , in this section we choose the particle in a square box with the interaction potential @xmath89 that resembles the one in the barbanis hamiltonian@xcite . in this case",
    "we may choose the point group @xmath88 with symmetry operations @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "the bases for the irreducible representations @xmath92 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . the antiunitary operator @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , leaves the hamiltonian invariant when @xmath97 real .",
    "it follows from @xmath98 and equation ( [ eq : haxpsi ] ) that it is possible that @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; that is to say symmetry may be unbroken and the eigenvalues may be real for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the fact that the perturbation correction of first order vanishes for all the states which suggests that the perturbation expansion exhibits only even powers of @xmath3 as in the case of the barbanis hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the results of the diagonalization method are shown in figure  [ fig : emn_c2 ] .",
    "all the eigenvalues of both types of symmetry appear to be real for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 as expected from the argument based on pgs .",
    "both sets of eigenvalues exhibit exceptional points where a pair of eigenvalues coalesce and emerge as complex conjugate numbers .",
    "the main features of the spectrum of this model resemble those described in earlier problems .",
    "in this paper we have discussed two non - hermitian hamiltonians with completely different spectra . both are representative of a wider class of non - hermitian hamiltonians that depend on a parameter @xmath3 in such a way that they are hermitian when @xmath4 and pt - symmetric for @xmath3 nonzero and imaginary ( say , @xmath13 , @xmath14 real ) .",
    "the @xmath88 model is similar to those studied earlier that were chosen in such a way that all the eigenvalues are real when @xmath101@xcite .",
    "it is said that they exhibit a pt phase transition at @xmath102 that was conjectured to be a high - energy phenomenon@xcite ( at least for those examples ) .",
    "consistent with real eigenvalues is the fact that their perturbation series exhibit only even powers of @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 model is the main goal of this paper because it appears to exhibit complex eigenvalues for all values of @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in this case the pt phase transition takes place at the trivial hermitian limit .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the degeneracy of the unperturbed hamiltonian is broken at first order of perturbation theory so that the eigenvalues are almost linear functions of @xmath13 for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 .",
    "it has been our purpose to show that pgs is quite useful for the study of the spectra of such non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "the analysis of the eigenfunctions from such point of view clearly shows that pt symmetry is broken for those that are bases for some irreducible representations ( @xmath57 and @xmath53 in the present case ) .",
    "we may formulate the main ideas in a somewhat more general way .",
    "in general , the eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is an irreducible representation of the point group for the model .",
    "if @xmath106 , were @xmath107 is an antiunitary operation that leaves the hamiltonian invariant , then it is possible that @xmath108 ( unbroken pt symmetry ) and the corresponding eigenvalues are real .",
    "all the models studied before exhibit this property@xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath52 and @xmath56 of present @xmath9 model also behave in this way .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of the eigenfunctions of symmetry @xmath57 and @xmath53 that we may generalize it in the following way : when @xmath109 where @xmath110 then pt symmetry is broken @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , this relationship is not a rigorous proof that the eigenvalues are complex . in a recent paper",
    "we have shown that the eigenvalues of a pt symmetric rigid rotor are real even when pt - symmetry is broken as just indicated@xcite . in the case of present @xmath9 model the eigenvalues",
    "are in fact complex and for this reason we have decided to coin the term _ pt - symmetry broken by pgs_.    in closing , we want to put forward an additional argument .",
    "let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be the real and imaginary parts of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 , and assume that @xmath113 is invariant under the inversion operator @xmath115 .",
    "then the product @xmath116 of degenerate eigenfunctions of @xmath113 is invariant under @xmath117 as shown by the character tables of the symmetry point groups@xcite . under such conditions , if @xmath118 then @xmath119 and the perturbation correction of first order vanishes .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath24 is invariant under the antiunitary operator @xmath120 and it is possible that the spectrum be real . if , on the other hand , @xmath121 then some of the perturbation corrections of first order for the degenerate states may not vanish and the corresponding eigenvalues are expected to be complex .    in section  [ sec : pgs ]",
    "@xmath88 plays the role of @xmath117 and we appreciate that both @xmath122 and @xmath123 are invariant under @xmath88 . for this reason",
    "there are complex eigenvalues even though the non - hermitian hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath124 and @xmath74 ( it is not invariant under @xmath107 ) . on the other hand , the inversion operation changes the sign of the potential in equation ( [ eq : v_m_2 ] ) and the perturbation corrections of first order for all the states vanish . in this case",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath107 and exhibits real spectrum for sufficiently small values of @xmath14",
