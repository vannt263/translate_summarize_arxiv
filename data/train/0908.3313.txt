    "it is known that there are two types of @xmath3ray emitting active galactic nuclei ( agn ) : blazars and radiogalaxies .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) has typically two broad peaks : one , at low frequencies , is due to the radiation emitted by synchrotron processes ; the second , at high frequencies , is thought to be due to inverse - compton scattering ( ic ) of high - energy electrons off ambient seed photons . the underlying physical mechanism generating such a type of sed is supposed to be the same : a relativistic jet observed with different viewing angles , very small in the case of blazars and larger for radiogalaxies ( see fossati et al . 1998 and donato et al .",
    "2001 for blazars ; see ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 , tavecchio & ghisellini 2008 for radiogalaxies ) .",
    "the seds of blazars seem to have different shapes depending on the emitted power and are organized in the so - called `` blazar sequence '' ( fossati et al .",
    "in particular , high - luminosity blazars have the peaks at low frequencies ( `` red '' blazars ) , while as the luminosities of the objects decrease , the peaks shift to higher frequencies , so that the lowest luminosity blazars are detected even at tev energies ( `` blue '' blazars ) .",
    "the blazar sequence can be interpreted in terms of changes of the seed photons for the ic processes ( ghisellini et al .",
    "blue blazars have no or weak emission lines ( equivalent width @xmath4   ) and the ic seed photons are those from the synchtrotron radiation ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1985 , band & grindlay 1985 ) . instead",
    ", red blazars have strong ( @xmath5   ) emission lines and the seed photons are from the broad - line region ( blr ) or accretion disk or even from the molecular torus ( e.g. dermer et al .",
    "1992 , sikora et al .",
    "1994 , baejowski et al .",
    "it is worth noting that all the permitted emission lines - with weak or strong intensities - are broad , i.e. with @xmath6  km / s ( see , e.g. , wills & browne 1986 , wang et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this was , roughly speaking , the scenario before of the launch of _",
    "the surprise came with the detection by the large area telescope ( lat , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , onboard the _ fermi _ satellite , of a bright @xmath3ray source associated with the quasar pmn j0948 + 0022 ( abdo et al . 2009a , b , c ) .",
    "this quasar is known to be a radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 , with narrow permitted lines , bump of feii and the flux ratio between [ oiii ] and @xmath1 smaller than 3 ( zhou et al .",
    "2003 , komossa et al .",
    "2006 , yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) . particularly , the fwhm of @xmath1 is about @xmath7  km / s ( zhou et al .",
    "2003 , yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) , the narrowest permitted line ever detected in a @xmath3ray emitting agn .",
    "two observations at different epochs ( 28  february and 27  march  2000 ) were available at the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "( sdss ) , indicating a change in the intensity ( ew ) of the @xmath1 from @xmath8   to @xmath9   within about one month .",
    "this `` surprise '' was somehow expected , since radio observations of pmn j0948 + 0022 have shown a compact source , with flat spectrum and high brightness temperature , suggesting the presence of a relativistic jet ( doi et al .",
    "2006 , yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) . the @xmath3ray detection by _ fermi _ confirmed this suggestion and allowed to build a complete sed",
    ": it was found that pmn j0948 + 0022 has the characteristics of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , but with low power , relatively small mass ( @xmath10 ) and high accretion ( @xmath11% the eddington value ) .",
    "more details can be found in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009c ) .",
    "we take the opportunity of this work to deal with more details on the classification . indeed",
    ", this will be the first source of a new population of @xmath3ray emitting agn and , therefore , it is necessary to address carefully all the known possible issues and doubts .",
    "kev ) of pmn j0948 + 0022 obtained by integrating @xmath12 swift / xrt observations performed between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for a total exposure of @xmath15  ks .",
    "radio observations at @xmath16  ghz from nvss ( dashed yellow lines ) and first ( continuous white lines ) are superimposed .",
    "epoch of coordinates is j2000 .",
    "color bar indicates x - ray counts . ]",
    "[ fig : sed ] shows the sed of pmn j0948 + 0022 compared with the blazar sequence ( continuous lines of different colors ) and a few of the most powerful radiogalaxies ( cen  a , m  87 , ngc  6251 ) .",
    "it is immediately evident that pmn j0948 + 0022 is in the region of blazars , with the observed emitted power well above the radiogalaxies region .",
    "this is an observational evidence , which does not need for any further explanation .",
    "the study of the morphology of the source at radio frequencies shows a very compact source from @xmath17 to @xmath18  ghz ( see doi et al .",
    "2006 ) , except for the data at @xmath16  ghz from the nvss ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrtfirst ] ) . in this case",
    ", there seems to be an extended structure , but it is likely to be an artifact of low angular resolution of nvss ( @xmath19 , condon et al .",
    "indeed , images at higher resolution ( @xmath20 , becker et al . 1995 ) from the first survey ( @xmath16  ghz ) indicated the presence of two resolved sources , @xmath21 distant each other , one of which is the core of pmn  j0948 + 0022 ( with flux @xmath22  mjy ) , while the second one is unknown and has a radio flux of @xmath23  mjy .",
    "no optical data are available in any public catalog .",
    "_ swift_/uvot observations found no source at any filter with these upper limits ( @xmath24 , in units of @xmath25  erg  @xmath26  s@xmath27 ) : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "no x - ray source was found by integrating all the available @xmath12 swift / xrt observations ( total exposure @xmath15  ks ) , with an upper limit ( @xmath24 ) of @xmath34  erg  @xmath26  s@xmath27 in the @xmath35  kev energy band .",
    "search for detections at lower frequencies did not result any useful data ( a. capetti , private communication ) .",
    "no detection was found , both for pmn j0948 + 0022 and the unknown nearby source in the very large array low - frequency sky survey ( vlss ) at @xmath36  mhz ( cohen et al .",
    "2007 ) , with an upper limit of @xmath37  mjy , which is not very constraining .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that there is any link between pmn j0948 + 0022 and the unknown source .",
    "we can also add that - in case we considered the unknown source as extended emission of the rl - nls1 - the `` extended''/core flux ratio of 0.13 is in the range of lobe - dominated sources ( cf ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) , which in turn imply a strong x - ray emission from the unknown source ( not observed ) and very low doppler factors ( @xmath38 ) at odds with @xmath3ray emission and the observed variability .",
    "the most striking differences with blazars and radiogalaxies emerge in the optical spectrum . again , since radiogalaxies have optical spectra similar to seyferts or low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , it is tempting to try recovering this option . however , this is not the case .",
    "liner are easily discarded because of the high - power of the source ( cf fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) and the absence of other low - ionization lines , such as [ oi ] ( for a review , see ho 2008 ) . with respect to the differences with seyferts , nls1 are indeed an agn class separate from seyfert 1 and 2 ( for a review , see pogge 2000 ) . as known , it is possible to observe broad ( permitted ) and narrow ( permitted and forbidden ) emission lines in seyfert 1 , while only narrow lines can be observed in seyfert 2 , since a molecular torus on the line of sight hampers the viewing of the broad - line region ( blr ) and allow only to see the narrow - line region ( nlr ) . in the case of nls1 , we are observing lines from the blr , which are narrower than usual , but are indeed coming from the blr , not from the nlr ( see also rodrguez - ardila et al .",
    "there is no obscuration hampering the viewing of the blr , as in seyfert 2 , otherwise this would result in [ oiii]/h@xmath39 ( like in seyfert 2 ) and the absence of feii bump , which is observed in seyfert 1 , but not in seyfert 2 .",
    "the narrowness of the permitted lines is an indicator of physical conditions , which are really different from those in other seyferts .",
    "decarli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested that the observed spectrum of nls1 is due to the fact that these sources have a disk - like blr and we are observing it pole - on .",
    "therefore , there is no component of the circular motion in the disk directed toward the observer , which can cause the doppler broadening . on the other hand , marconi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) explain the narrowness of blr lines as due to the radiation pressure of an accretion disk close to the eddington limit , which pushes the blr farther from the central spacetime singularity .",
    "due to the high - redshift of pmn j0948 + 0022 ( @xmath40 ) , no direct information of the morphology of its host galaxy is available . however , since seyferts are generally hosted by spiral galaxies and radio - loud agn are in ellipticals , the possibility to find a relativistic jet in a spiral galaxy is surely charming .",
    "there are some studies on the nls1 morphology suggesting a bulge - dominated structure ( zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) , even with some starburst contribution ( antn et al .",
    "2008 sani et al . 2009 ) .",
    "work is in progress to study the specific case of pmn j0948 + 0022 .",
    "we can conclude that pmn j0948 + 0022 is a @xmath3ray emitting agn really different from blazars and radiogalaxies and , therefore , _ it represents the first detection of a likely emerging new population of @xmath3ray agn_.    it is not clear what is the impact of these newly discovered sources in the unified scheme of agn and , specifically , for radio - loud sources . for example , such a type of source was not predicted by the well - known unified scheme of radio - loud agn proposed by urry & padovani ( 1995 ) .",
    "another example is in the fig .  7 of boroson ( 2002 ) , where this population would hardly find its place",
    ": it should be in the right part of the figure , in the radio - loud region , perhaps at the border with radio - quiet objects and close to the bal qso ( broad - absorption line quasi - stellar objects ) region , but if it will be confirmed a spiral host galaxy for rl - nls1 , this would be at odds with the whole diagram .",
    "so , we are not able yet to give an answer to these questions and issues . a multiwavelength campaign on pmn j0948 +",
    "0022 was performed from 26 march to 5 july 2009 and will surely give some additional hints to understand the nature of rl - nls1 .",
    "more information will likely to come from the increasing numbers of this type of sources that will be detected at @xmath3rays by _ fermi_/lat .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
