    "<S> transverse momentum integrated multiplicities in the central region of @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies satisfy koba - nielsen - olesen scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to relate this finding to multiplicity distributions of soft gluons . </S>",
    "<S> kno scaling emerges if the effective theory describing color charge fluctuations at a scale on the order of the saturation momentum is approximately gaussian . from an evolution equation for quantum corrections which includes both saturation as well as fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> we find that evolution with the qcd @xmath1-function satisfies kno scaling while fixed - coupling evolution does not . </S>",
    "<S> thus , non - linear saturation effects and running - coupling evolution are both required in order to reproduce geometric scaling of the dis cross section and kno scaling of virtual dipoles in a hadron wave function . </S>"
