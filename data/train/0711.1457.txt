    "field - effect mobilities in polycrystalline organic semiconductors are comparable to the mobilities in hydrogenated amorphous silicon and the organic semiconductors can be deposited by thermal evaporation or from solution at low costs on large areas .",
    "pentacene and its soluble derivatives are among the most promising organic semiconductors for organic thin - film transistor applications.@xcite    organic semiconductors are distinct in that they generally consist of neutral molecules which interact by rather weak forces ( predominantly van der waals forces ) . the energy associated with a van der waals bond is 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4ev , i.e. orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a covalent bond ( several ev).@xcite therefore , organic semiconductors are soft , have a low mechanic strength and a high compressibility , low melting and sublimation temperatures and a large thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "the weak interaction forces between the molecules not only enable low - cost processing but also lead to peculiarities such as the existence of at least four different pentacene polymorphs or an even negative thermal expansion coefficient.@xcite    as in the case of amorphous inorganic materials , the charge transport in organic semiconductors can be described with a mobility edge or transport level concept . in the case of crystalline small molecule organic semiconductors such as pentacene , the mobility edge may be identified with the valence or conduction band edge and the charge carriers are transported in extended states .",
    "however , the charge carriers are transported in states above a mobility edge and are multiply trapped by and thermally released from trap states below the mobility edge .",
    "consequently , the conduction of charge in organic semiconductors and thus the transistor characteristics critically depend on trap states .",
    "energetically deep traps influence the subthreshold swing of a device which needs to be sufficiently steep for a low power operation .",
    "the density of shallow traps , on the contrary , can dominate the effective field - effect mobility .",
    "trap states in organic semiconductors have long been a subject of investigation.@xcite this topic is currently attracting much attention due to the crucial importance of trap states for the emerging applications of organic field - effect transistors.@xcite the shallow traps in particular are poorly understood .",
    "the density of trap states as a function of energy can be derived from the transistor characteristics . on the one hand ,",
    "a density of states function can be postulated a priori and the corresponding transistor characteristic can be simulated by means of a suitable computer program .",
    "the density of states function is then iteratively refined until , after a number of predictor - corrector loops , good agreement between the measured characteristic and the simulated curve is achieved.@xcite on the other hand , the density of states function can be calculated from the linear regime transfer characteristics in a straightforward fashion .",
    "a number of such extraction schemes has been suggested.@xcite this approach has the advantage of giving an unambiguous result but , depending on the complexity of the extraction scheme , spurious errors may result from simplifying assumptions .",
    "organic thin - film transistors ( tfts ) are most often characterized after the samples have been exposed to ambient air and in situ electrical characterization is very rare.@xcite the organic semiconductors , however , are generally presumed to be sensitive to water vapor and oxygen . moreover ,",
    "the transistors are often characterized by two - terminal measurements which do not allow to distinguish between contact effects and effects of the semiconducting layer .",
    "the gated four - terminal method yields the field - effect conductivity and the effective field - effect mobility free from contact effects .",
    "it also allows for an extraction of the device contact resistance.@xcite    for this work pentacene served as a prototypical small molecule semiconductor and we have investigated the performance of pentacene thin - film transistors by in situ gated four - terminal measurements .",
    "the corresponding trap states functions were derived with a straightforward extraction scheme which had been successfully used to understand trap states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon .",

    "pentacene thin - film transistors were fabricated and characterized electrically by gated four - terminal measurements at a base pressure of order 10@xmath0 mbar without breaking the high vacuum . ]",
    "the substrates were kept in high vacuum for approximately 24h prior to the device fabrication .",
    "after that time , also the pressure in the turbo - pumped load lock was @xmath6 mbar .",
    "a 50 nm thick film of pentacene was evaporated through the shadow mask onto the si / sio@xmath5 substrates while the substrates were kept at room temperature .",
    "after the pentacene evaporation , the sample holder was positioned on a shadow mask for the gold evaporation with transfer rod 1 and the pentacene tfts were completed by evaporating 40 nm thick gold electrodes .",

    "a device was measured initially @xmath18h after the completion of the pentacene evaporation .",
    "subsequently , the same device was measured regularly ( normally twice a day ) for approximately one week while being kept in the prober station at @xmath6 mbar in the dark .    in some experiments",
    ", the effect of oxygen or nitrogen exposure on the device characteristics was investigated .",
    "this was done by introducing a continuous flow of gas ( pureness @xmath19vol.-@xmath20 ) into the prober station through a leak valve , thus adjusting the partial pressure of the gas within the prober station .",
    "a few days prior to the device fabrication for the gas exposure experiments , the prober station was filled with the respective gas through the leak valve in order to flush the gas supply line and the valve .",
    "the prober station was then re - evacuated and the supply lines were held at an overpressure of @xmath21atm until the leak valve was opened in the experiment .    in other experiments ,",
    "the influence of annealing was explored by means of an electrical heating element on the sample holder tray in the prober station .",
    "in this section , we elucidate the extraction of key parameters from the device characteristics .",
    "linear regime transfer characteristics are particularly interesting for the study of semiconductor physics , because the gradual channel approximation is valid which leads to a drastic simplification of the device physics . the two - dimensional problem is approximated by two one - dimensional equations , i.e. possion s equation for the charge distribution perpendicular to the insulator - semiconductor interface and a simple ohmic current - voltage relationship .      in single crystalline inorganic mosfets above a threshold voltage ,",
    "essentially all the trap states are filled and the charge which is induced by the gate appears in the valence / conduction band.@xcite both the constant mobility in the above threshold regime and the threshold voltage are important device parameters .",
    "this approach may also be valid in the case of organic single crystal transistors , i.e. organic field - effect transistors with a very low trap density .",
    "however , contact effects often severely affect the characteristics of these devices because of the low channel resistance.@xcite    as in the case of amorphous silicon field - effect transistors , the equations developed for single crystalline mosfets are not suitable to describe organic tfts due to the increased trap density.@xcite depending on the density of trap states , the majority of charge carriers induced by the gate may be trapped even at relatively high gate voltages.@xcite provided that contact effects are negligible , the drain current of an organic tft in the linear regime is given by @xmath22 @xmath23 is the field - effect conductivity which is the effective field - effect mobility @xmath24 multiplied with the total gate induced charge per unit area @xmath25 , i.e @xmath26 @xmath27 is the flatband voltage and @xmath28 the capacitance per unit area .",
    "the effective field - effect mobility is one of the most important device parameters and , for a p - type semiconductor such as pentacene , @xmath24 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the density of free and trapped holes per unit area .",
    "@xmath32 is the extended state mobility . the effective field - effect mobility @xmath24 is expected to increase with gate voltage even at relatively high gate voltages , because the ratio @xmath33 increases as the valence band is bent towards the fermi energy.@xcite    the flatband voltage is the gate voltage which needs to be applied in order to enforce flat bands at the insulator - semiconductor interface .",
    "a non - zero flatband voltage can result from a difference of the semiconductor and the gate fermi levels .",
    "more importantly , the flatband voltage is influenced by charge that is permanently trapped at the interface or within the gate dielectric and only the latter contribution can explain the large shifts of the transfer characteristics that are sometimes observed in experiments.@xcite the flatband voltage is approximately equal to the onset voltage of the device .",
    "the onset voltage is defined as the gate voltage , where the drain current , as a function of gate voltage , rises sharply if plotted on a logarithmic scale . in the present work",
    "we assume that the flatband voltage is equal to the onset voltage .    from a technological point of view",
    "it is useful to define a threshold voltage which marks the transition between the regime below threshold to the regime above threshold . in the above - threshold regime ,",
    "the deep traps are filled and the field - effect mobility is less strongly dependent on gate voltage . the above - threshold regime in an organic tft can be understood as being in between the below - threshold regime and the above - threshold regime of a single crystalline mosfet.@xcite it can be shown that the field - effect mobility in the above - threshold regime follows a power law @xmath34 and this allows for a refined extraction of the field - effect mobility and the threshold voltage @xmath35.@xcite    in this study we do , however , follow the ieee standard for the characterization of organic transistors and materials .",

    "however , small errors in the absolute value of the field - effect mobility and its gate voltage dependence are to be expected since the derivation rests on the assumption of a weak dependence of the field - effect mobility on gate voltage.@xcite    in an organic field - effect transistor , a significant fraction of the drain voltage @xmath38 may drop at the contacts which can introduce significant errors when extracting the field - effect conductivity and the field - effect mobility . from gated - four terminal measurements ,",

    "grnewald et al . have suggested an extraction scheme of high accuracy for amorphous silicon thin - film transistors which allows to convert a single linear regime transfer characteristic into the underlying density of states function.@xcite it is based on surprisingly few simplifying assumptions including :    a.   the gradual channel approximation , b.   the semiconductor is homogenous normal to the dielectric - semiconductor interface , and c.   insulator surface states only introduce an initial band bending without applied field , i.e. contribute to a non - zero flatband voltage @xmath27 .",

    "when concentrating on the channel region adjacent to the gate dielectric in a field - effect transistor , the annealing is found to leave the mobility unchanged ( ref .  ) or to lead to an increased mobility ( ref .  ) .",

    "the `` annealing '' of shallow traps at room temperature can easily explain the increase in the effective field - effect mobility .      in a simplistic view ,",
    "the contact resistance is given by the energetic difference between the work function of the metal and the ionization energy of the pentacene .",
