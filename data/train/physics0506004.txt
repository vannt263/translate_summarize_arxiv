    "it is usual to consider the famous experiment of fizeau ( 1851)@xcite on the drag of light by a uniformly moving medium as one of the crucial experiments which , just as the michelson - morley experiment , can not be correctly understood without profound modification of newtonian space - time concepts ( for a review of einstein s relativity as well as a discussion of several experiments the reader is invited to consult @xcite ) .",
    "the result of this experiment which was predicted by fresnel@xcite , in the context of elastic theory , is indeed completely justified by well known arguments due to von laue ( 1907 ) @xcite .",
    "he deduced the fresnel - fizeau result for the light velocity @xmath0 in a medium , corresponding to a relativistic first order expansion of the einstein velocity transformation formula : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 represents the optical index of refraction of the dielectric medium in its proper frame , and we suppose that the uniform medium motion with velocity @xmath3 is parallel to the path of the light and oriented in the same direction of propagation . in the context of electromagnetic theory @xcite",
    "all derivations of this effect are finally based on the invariance property of the wave operator @xmath4 $ ] in a lorentz transformation .",
    "it is easy to write the wave equation @xmath5\\psi=0 $ ] in the co - moving frame r@xmath6 of the medium in covariant form@xcite @xmath7\\psi=0 $ ] which is valid in all inertial frames and which for a plane waves , implies the result of eq .",
    "in this calculation we obtain the result @xmath8 if we use the galilean transformation which proves the insufficiency of newtonian dynamics .",
    "+ however , the question of the physical meaning of this phenomenon is not completely clear .",
    "this fact is in part due to the existence of a derivation made by lorentz ( 1895 ) @xcite based on the mixing between the macroscopic maxwell s equations and a microscopic electronic oscillator model which is classical in the sense of the newtonian dynamics . in his derivation lorentz did not use the relativistic transformation between the two coordinate frames : laboratory and moving medium .",
    "consequently , the relativistic nature of the reasoning does not appear explicitly .",
    "following the point of view of einstein ( 1915 ) @xcite the lorentz demonstration must contain an implicit hypothesis of relativistic nature , however , this point has not been studied in the literature .",
    "recent developments in optics of moving media @xcite allows us to consider this question as an important one to understand the relation between optics , relativity and newtonian dynamics .",
    "this constitutes the subject of the present paper . here , we want to analyze the physical origin of the fresnel - fizeau effect .",
    "in particular we want to show that this phenomenon is , in its major part , independent of relativistic dynamics . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the generalized lorentz `` microscopic - macroscopic '' derivation of the fresnel formula and the principal defect of this treatment . in section iii",
    "we show how to derive the fresnel result in a perturbation approach based on the lorentz oscillator model and finally in iv we justify this effect independently from all physical assumptions concerning the electronic structure of matter .",
    "in this part , we are going to describe the essential contents of the lorentz model and of its relativistic extension .",
    "let @xmath9 be the displacement of an electron from its equilibrium position at rest , written as an explicit function of the atomic position @xmath10 and of the time @xmath11 . in the continuum approximation we can write the equation of motion for the oscillator as @xmath12 where the supposed harmonic electric incident field appears and where the assumption of small velocity allows us to neglect the magnetic force term . in the case of a non relativistic uniformly moving medium we have @xmath13 which includes the magnetic field @xmath14 of the plane wave and the associated force due to the uniform motion with velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of propagation of the electromagnetic wave in the moving medium has an elementary solution when the velocity of the light and of the medium are parallel . if we refer to a cartesian frame @xmath16 , @xmath17 we have in this case @xmath18 , @xmath19 for the electromagnetic field and @xmath20 for the displacement vector parallel to the @xmath21 axis .",
    "the relativistic extension of this model can be obtained directly putting @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ deux ] or [ trois ] and using a lorentz transformation between the moving frame and the laboratory one .",
    "we deduce the displacement @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "we could alternatively obtain the same result considering the generalization of the newton dynamics i.  e.   by doing the substitutions @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",
    "the dispersion relation is then completely fixed by the maxwell equation @xmath27 , where the current density @xmath28 is given by the formula @xmath29 depending on the local number of atoms per unit volume @xmath30 supposed to be constant . using @xmath28 and eq .",
    "[ trois ] or [ quatre ] we obtain a dispersion relation @xmath31 where the effective refractive index @xmath32 depends on the angular frequency @xmath33 and on the velocity @xmath3 . the more general index obtained using eq .",
    "[ quatre ] is defined by the implicit relation @xmath34 [ 1-\\frac{n\\left(\\omega\\right)v_{e}}{c}]^{2}\\label{cinq}.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the classical lorentz index ( also called drude index ) which contains the local proper density which is defined in the frame where the medium is immobile by @xmath37 .",
    "these relativistic equations imply directly the correct relativistic formula for the velocity of light in the medium : writing @xmath38 we deduce @xmath39 which can be easily transformed into @xmath40 it can be added that by combining these expressions we deduce the explicit formula @xmath41 } { [ 1+\\frac{n_{0}\\left(\\omega'\\right)v_{e}}{c}]^{2}}.\\ ] ] the non relativistic case can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "[ trois ] or by writting @xmath42 in eqs .",
    "[ cinq],[six ] . this limit @xmath43 + o\\left(\\frac{v_{e}^{2}}{c^{2}}\\right)\\ ] ] is the fresnel - fizeau formula corrected by a  frequency - dispersion \" term due to lorentz@xcite .",
    "for our purpose , it is important to note that in the non - relativistic limit of eq .",
    "[ cinq ] we can always write the equality @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the index of refraction defined relatively to the moving medium .",
    "we then can see directly that the association of maxwell s equation with newtonian dynamics implies a modification of the intuitive assumption  @xmath46 \" used in the old theory of emission .",
    "in fact , the problem can be understood in the newtonian mechanics using the absolute time @xmath47 and the transformation @xmath48 . in the laboratory",
    "frame the speed of light , which in vacuum is @xmath49 , becomes @xmath50 in a medium at rest . in the moving frame",
    "the speed of light in vacuum is now @xmath51@xcite .",
    "however , due to invariance of acceleration and resultant force in a galilean transformation we can interpret the presence of the magnetic term in eq .  [ deux ] as a correction to the electric field in the moving frame .",
    "this effective electric field affecting the oscillator in the moving frame is then transformed into @xmath52 .",
    "it is this term which essentially implies the existence of the effective optical index @xmath53 and the light speed @xmath54 in the moving frame .",
    "it can be observed that naturally maxwell s equations are not invariant in a galilean transformation .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath52 as an effective electric field is in the context of newtonian dynamics only formal : this field is introduced as an analogy with the case @xmath22 only in order to show that @xmath55 must be different from @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity of the slab is @xmath56 , and the three spatial regions in front , in and after the slab are denoted by 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "we have plotted in addition a typical observation point p(@xmath57,0,0 ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +",
    "the difficulty of the preceding model is that the lorentz derivation does not clarify the meaning of the fresnel - fizeau phenomenon .",
    "indeed we justify eq .",
    "[ un ] using a microscopical model which is in perfect agreement with the principle of relativity .",
    "however we observe that at the limit @xmath58 the use of the non relativistic dynamics of newton ( see eq .",
    "[ deux ] ) gives the same result .",
    "more precisely one can see from eq .",
    "[ deux ] that the introduction of the magnetic force @xmath59 in addition to the electric force is already sufficient to account for the fresnel - fizeau effect and this even if the classical force formula @xmath60 is conserved .",
    "since the electromagnetic force contains the ratio @xmath61 and originates from maxwell s equations this is already a term of relativistic nature ( einstein used indeed this fact to modify the dynamical laws of newton@xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of lorentz is then based on newton as well as on einstein dynamics .",
    "it is well know in counterpart that the doppler - fizeau effect , which includes the same factor @xmath62 , can be understood without introducing einstein s relativity .",
    "indeed this effect is just a consequence of the invariance of the phase associated with a plane wave when we apply a galilean transformation ( see @xcite , chap .",
    "11 ) as well as a lorentz transformation .",
    "we must then analyze further in detail the interaction of a plane wave with a moving dipole in order to see if the fresnel phenomenon can be understood independently of the specific lorentz dynamics .",
    "+ we consider in this part a different calculation based on a perturbation method and inspired by a derivation of the optical theorem by feynman@xcite .",
    "consider a thin slab of thickness @xmath63 perpendicular to the @xmath57 axis .",
    "let this slab move along the positive @xmath57 direction with the constant velocity @xmath64 .",
    "let in addition @xmath65 be the incident electric field of a plane wave which pursues the moving slab ( see fig .",
    "[ slab ] ) .",
    "therefore , the electric field after the slab can be formally written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 appear as a retardation time produced by the interaction of light with the slab and where all reflections are neglected ( @xmath68 ) . for a `` motionless '' slab ( i.  e. , the case considered by feynman ) we can write the travel time of the light through the slab as @xmath69 and therefore @xmath70 where @xmath71 defines the proper length of the slab in the frame where it is at rest . for the general case of a moving slab of reduced length @xmath72 we find for the travel time : @xmath73 and",
    "therefore the perturbation time is @xmath74 we can obtain this result more rigorously by using maxwell s boundary conditions at the two moving interfaces separating the matter of the slab and the air ( see appendix a ) .    in order to evaluate the diffracted field which is @xmath75 we can limit our calculation to a first order approximation .",
    "thereby , each dipole of the lorentz model as discussed above can be considered as being excited directly by the incident electromagnetic wave and where we can neglect all phenomena implying multiple interactions between light and matter . in this limit",
    "[ caput ] reduces to @xmath76 if the distance between the slab and an observation point is much larger than @xmath63 we can consider the slab as a 2d continuous distribution of radiating point dipoles .",
    "the vector potential @xmath77 radiated by a relativistically moving point charge @xmath78 is in according with the lienard - wiechert s formula given by @xcite : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the distance separating the observation point @xmath81 ( denoted by p ) and the point charge position located at @xmath82 at the time @xmath11 ; additionally @xmath83 is the velocity of the point charge and @xmath84 is the unit vector @xmath85 . in this formula , in agreement with causality , all point charge variables are evaluated at the retarded time @xmath86 . + in the present case the motion of the point charge can be decomposed into a uniform longitudinal component @xmath87 oriented along the positive @xmath57 direction and into a transversal oscillating part @xmath88 obeying the condition @xmath89 . owing to this condition we can identify @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , in the far - field the contribution of the electron uniform velocity is cancelled by the similar but opposite contribution associated with the nucleus of the atomic dipole : only the vibrating contribution of the electron survives at a long distance from the diffraction source .",
    "if we add the contribution of each dipole of the slab acting on the observation point p at the time @xmath11 we obtain then the total diffracted vector potential @xmath92 produced by the moving medium : @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the radial coordinate in a cylindrical coordinate system using the direction @xmath57 as a revolution axis , and the quantity @xmath95 is the number of dipoles contained in the cylindrical volume of length @xmath63 and of radius varying between @xmath94 and @xmath96 if we consider a local dipole density given by @xmath97 . in this formula the retarded distance @xmath98 is a function of @xmath94 and we have ( see the textbook of jackson @xcite ) @xmath99 this expression shows that the minimum @xmath100 is obtained for a point charge on the @xmath57 axis , and that : @xmath101 in order to evaluate the integral in eq .",
    "[ field ] we must use in addition the following relation ( see appendix c ) : @xmath102 hence , we obtain the following integral : @xmath103 where we have used the relations eq .",
    "[ cacatoes ] , eq .",
    "[ cactus ] in the denominator and in the exponential argument of the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ field ] , respectively .",
    "the diffracted field is therefore directly calculable by using the variable @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain the result @xmath105 the total diffracted electric field @xmath106 is obtained using maxwell s formula @xmath107 , which gives : @xmath108 the final result is given substituting eq .",

    "it can again be observed that the present calculation can be reproduced in the non relativistic case by neglecting all terms of order @xmath112 .",

    "this fact can be directly deduced of the energy and momentum conservation laws .",
    "indeed , let @xmath118 be the momentum of the slab of mass @xmath119 before the collision and @xmath120 the energy of the plane of light , then during the interaction the slab is in a excited state and its energy is now @xmath121 and its momentum @xmath122 .",
    "the velocity of the excited slab is defined by @xmath123 and we can see that in the approximation @xmath124 used here @xmath125 ( we neglect the recoil of the slab ) . during @xmath117",
    "the slab moves along a path length equal to @xmath126 and thus the travel condition of the plane of energy in the moving slab can be written @xmath127 which is an other form for eq .",

    "a photon moving along the axis @xmath57 and pursuing an atom moving at the velocity @xmath3 constitutes a good analogy to understand the fresnel phenomenon .",

    "[ ultime3 ] when @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",

    "the unique difference with the section 3 is that now this slab is not bounded by two interfaces separating the atoms from the vacuum but is surrounded by a continuous medium having the same properties and moving at the same velocity @xmath3 . in the laboratory frame",

    "indeed there are several situations where we can develop a deep analogy between the propagation of sound and the propagation of light .",
    "this implies that the conclusions obtained for the fresnel effect for light must to a large part be valid for sound as well .",
    "this is in particular true if we consider an effective meta material like the one that is going to be described now : + we consider a system of mirrors as represented in fig .  2a , at rest in the laboratory . a beam of light propagates along the zigzag trajectory @xmath171 .",

    "in addition this model allows us to conclude that the essential element justifying the fresnel - fizeau result is the emergence of a delay time  a retardation effect when we consider the propagation of the signal at a microscopic or internal level . the index @xmath168 which characterizes the macroscopic or external approach is then just a way to define an effective velocity without looking for a causal explanation of the retardation . +",
    "the essential message of our analysis is that by taking explicitly into account the physical origin of the delay we can justify the essence of the fresnel - fizeau effect in a non relativistic way .",
    "the fresnel - fizeau effect is then a very general phenomenon .",
    "it is a consequence of the conservation of energy and momentum and of the constant value of the wave velocity in vacuum or in the considered medium .",
    "the so called travel condition ( eq .  [ condition ] ) which is a combination of these two points can be compared to the usual demonstration for the doppler effect . in these two cases of light pulses pursuing a moving particle",
    "the perturbation time @xmath188 is a manifestation of the doppler phenomenon .",

    "some connected discussions concerning the acoustic aharonov - bohm effect ( that is related to the optical aharonov - bohm effect that follows from the fizeau effect ) the reader should consult @xcite .",
    "we have obtain the fresnel - fizeau formula using a perturbation method based on the optical theorem and in a more general way by considering the physical origin of the refractive index .",
    "the modification of the speed of light in the medium appears then as a result of a retardation effect due to the duration of the interaction or absorbtion of light by the medium , and the fresnel - fizeau effect , as a direct consequence of the medium s flight in front of the light .",
    "these facts rely on the same origin as the doppler - fizeau effect .",
    "we finally have shown that it is not correct to assume , as frequently done in the past , that a coherent and `` newtonian interpretation '' of these phenomena would be impossible .",
    "on the contrary , the results do not invalidate the derivation of the fresnel - fizeau effect based on the principle of relativity but clarify it .",
    "we observe indeed than all reasoning is in perfect agreement with the principle of relativity .",
    "we must emphasize that even if the fizeau / fresnel effect is conceptually divorced from relativity it strongly motivated einstein s work ( more even than the michelson and morley result ) .",
    "the fact that the fizeau as well as the michelson - morley experiment can be justified so easily with special relativity clearly show the advantages of einstein s principle to obtain quickly the correct results .",
