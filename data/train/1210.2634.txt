    "however , these data also display some unexpected difference at room temperature , which is most likely related to the heat flow through the pressure clamp . subtracting the offset contribution from the @xmath19 measurement , scaled with the respective cross sections ( see above ) indeed yields corrected data which merge at room temperature .",
    "in addition , the data measured on a freely suspended sample nicely lie in between the corrected @xmath70 and @xmath39 which convinces us on the reliability of the analysis . using a background correction determined from data for @xmath19 , which displays _ isotropic _ tep behavior ,",

    "<S> these temperature dependences would be compatible with two - dimensional af quantum critical fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion has also been drawn from nmr measurements on bafe@xmath3(as@xmath1p@xmath16)@xmath3  @xcite and a sharp peak of the zero - temperature sc penetration depth for this latter system suggests a quantum critical point located in the sc state at optimum substitution  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the tep to investigate electronic nematicity in the isovalent substituted iron - pnictide eufe@xmath3(as@xmath1p@xmath16)@xmath3 on detwinned single crystals using a uniaxial - pressure technique . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , that tep is a very sensitive probe and displays a pronounced anisotropy for low substitution @xmath23 . remarkably , this anisotropy changes sign upon cooling from above to below the structural phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two contributions of opposite sign arising from anisotropic scattering dominating at @xmath59 and orbital polarization for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> for the future , it will be interesting to perform similar experiments on hole doped 122 pnictides , for which previous electrical resistivity measurements have found an opposite sign of the anisotropy  @xcite .    </S>",
