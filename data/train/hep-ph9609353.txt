    "there is an increasing interest in the transverse quark distributions in the nucleon , especially the chiral - odd structure function of twist two  @xcite , @xmath8 , and its first moment , the tensor charge of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the interest are the following .",
    "first , @xmath8 , complimentary to the conventional structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is essential to understand the nucleon spin substructure . at the same time , the tensor charge , @xmath11 , like the axial charge , is one of the fundamental observables for the nucleon . so far ,",
    "however , little is known about both @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "second , semi - inclusive deep - inelastic experiments aiming to measure @xmath1 , and hence the tensor charge of the proton and neutron , @xmath11 , are being planned  @xcite . now is the time for the theory to make predictions .",
    "it is important to remember that experimental results for the neutron can only be obtained from the indirect experiments , using the the lightest nuclear targets , the deuteron and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to have a reliable estimate of the nuclear effects , in order to extract dependable information about the neutron from the nuclear data .    in this letter",
    "we study the chiral - odd structure function and the tensor charge of the deuteron , @xmath2 and @xmath13 , in the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "the main motivation is to study the nuclear effects in the transverse - polarized deuteron structure function , @xmath14 , and the deuteron tensor charge , @xmath13 .",
    "since the nucleon tensor charge measures the net number of transversely polarized valence quarks ( quarks minus antiquarks ) in a transversely polarized nucleon  @xcite , and so it gets no contribution from the sea - quarks , the neutron isoscalar tensor charge is equal to the one of the proton . as a result , the measurement of the deuteron tensor charge may , in principle , provide a test for the models of the nuclear effects if the proton tensor charge is known precisely .",
    "in addition , an independent measurement of the neutron s @xmath15 and @xmath16 is obviously useful to understand the transverse spin distribution in the nucleon .",
    "therefore it is essential to account for the nuclear effects in the deuteron for both the chiral - odd structure function @xmath14 and the tensor charge , @xmath13 .",
    "the chiral - odd structure function of the deuteron of twist two , @xmath2 , is defined as a simple extension of the case of spin - half hadrons  @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of a matrix element of the quark bilocal operator : @xmath17 an antisymmetric tensor , @xmath18 , in the rest frame of the deuteron is defined by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the deuteron momentum , @xmath21 is the spin of the deuteron  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the deuteron polarization , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the deuteron mass .",
    "@xmath26 satisfies the conditions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the tensor charge of the deuteron is the first moment of @xmath2 and can be readily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ defh ] ) : @xmath29    using the following identities in the rest frame of the deuteron : @xmath30 the structure function @xmath2 and the charge @xmath13 are rewritten as the matrix elements of the lorentz scalar operators : @xmath31    it is impossible to solve eqs .",
    "( [ defhs ] ) and ( [ defgs ] ) directly , since the hadron state , @xmath32 , still can not be described in qcd .",
    "instead , we use approach where the `` elementary '' structure function , @xmath1 , is obtained on the quark level , while the nuclear effects are calculated on the hadron level ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we utilize the bethe - salpeter formalism , which was previously applied for studying the structure functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we neglect small possible off - mass - shell effects in the nucleon structure functions  @xcite .    in terms of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes",
    "@xmath14 reads : @xmath36 where m is the nucleon mass , @xmath37 is the relative momentum of nucleons in the deuteron , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the time and 3-rd components of the nucleon momentum , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the bethe - salpeter amplitude for the deuteron with the spin projection @xmath43 and the isoscalar structure function @xmath1 is defined as @xmath44 .",
    "note , that there is no explicit mesonic ( sea quarks ) contribution to the structure function @xmath14 .",
    "the mesons manifest themselves by binding the nucleons in the deuteron and , therefore , defining the structure of the amplitude @xmath42 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) can be rewritten in the convolution form  @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the `` effective transverse distribution '' of nucleons in the deuteron and its definition is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "this is a usual result for the nuclear structure functions calculated in the leading twist approximation , neglecting the off - mass - shell deformation of the nucleon structure function .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ conh1 ] ) allow immediately to write the sum rule for the deuteron tensor charge : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the nucleon field .",
    "( [ sr1 ] ) and ( [ sr2 ] ) define the renormalization factor of the nucleon tensor charge by the deuteron structure .",
    "this sum rule is similar to the sum rule for the deuteron structure function , @xmath49  @xcite : @xmath50 this sum rule is used for estimating the integral of the neutron structure function , @xmath51 , from the combined proton and deuteron data .",
    "note that in the static limit the matrix elements on the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ sr2 ] ) and ( [ sr3 ] ) are equal and approximate formulae for the deuteron structure functions are : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is weight of the d - wave component in the deuteron wave function .",
    "the method to calculate numerically expressions like ( [ h1 ] ) is discussed in ref .",
    "the most important details of the calculations are :    1 .",
    "a realistic model for the bethe - salpeter amplitudes is essential for a realistic estimate of the nuclear effects .",
    "we use a recent numerical solution  @xcite of the ladder bethe - salpeter equation with a realistic exchange kernel  @xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter amplitudes and , therefore , eq .  ( [ h1 ] ) have a nontrivial singular structure .",
    "these singularities must be carefully taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the bs amplitudes are numerically calculated with the help of the wick rotation .",
    "therefore , the procedure of the numerical inverse wick rotation must be applied .",
    "an essential ingredient of the calculations , the nucleon structure function @xmath8 , is unknown both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a reasonable estimate for using in our calculations should be found .",
    "the effects of the nuclear structure , the fermi motion and binding of nucleons , is encoded in the effective distribution function @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ conh1 ] ) .",
    "the result of calculation of @xmath54 with the bethe - salpeter amplitude of the deuteron  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ h ] ( solid line ) .",
    "two other effective distributions for the deuteron are also shown in fig .",
    "[ h ] for comparison .",
    "the first ( dashed line ) is @xmath55 , which defines the spin - dependent structure function @xmath56 .",
    "explicit expression for @xmath55 is similar to the one for @xmath57 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ conh1 ] ) ) , but with the operator @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 .",
    "if we again replace the operator by @xmath60 , we get another distribution , @xmath61 ( dotted line ) , which defines the spin - independent structure function @xmath62 .",
    "each of the three effective distribution functions ( @xmath57 , @xmath55 or @xmath61 ) would represent the correspondent structure functions of the deuteron ( @xmath14 , @xmath56 or @xmath62 ) if the nucleons in the deuteron would be the elementary fermions .",
    "note that the function @xmath57 is smaller at the maximum than @xmath55 , and also slightly smaller in its normalisation : @xmath63 this is opposite to the case of the nucleon , where @xmath1 is expected  @xcite to be larger than @xmath49 ( after exclusion of the quark charge factors ) .",
    "the effect is different , since in the polarized deuteron both nucleons are essentially polarized along the same direction , while in the polarized nucleon one quark is polarized in opposite direction and somehow cancels contribution of one of the quarks polarized along the nucleon polarization .",
    "the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath55 , and between the tensor and axial charges , ( [ sr2a ] ) and ( [ sr3a ] ) , is extremely small since the deuteron in essentially a nonrelativistic system and matrix elements of the operators @xmath64 and @xmath59 are _ exactly _ the same in the static limit .    the numerical value in eq .",
    "( [ sr2a ] ) is the deuteron structure factor renormalizing the nucleon tensor charge in the deuteron , calculated in a particular model of the @xmath65-interaction  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the differences among existing models , we can estimate a possible `` model '' error in  ( [ sr2a ] ) : @xmath66 .    to calculate the realistic structure function",
    "@xmath2 we need the nucleon structure functions @xmath8 .",
    "however , so far there is no existing experimental data for this function , and very little is known about the form of @xmath1 in theory . in the present paper we follow the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "since the sea quarks do not contribute to @xmath1 , its flavor content is simple : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the contributions of the u- and d - quarks , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since the matrix elements of the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 coincide in the static limit , as a crude estimate we can expect that @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are contributions of the u- and d - quarks to the spin of the nucleon , which is measured through the structure function @xmath49 .",
    "subsequently , the simplest estimate for @xmath1 @xmath75 should not be too unrealistic .",
    "in fact , the bag model calculation shows that difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is typically only a few percent  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is mostly a qualitative one , since it is limited by the case with one quark flavor and does not pretend to describe phenomenology .    to evaluate possible deviations from the simplistic choice of @xmath1 , ( [ hn2 ] ) with ( [ ab1 ] ) ,",
    "we suggest : @xmath78 where @xmath76 and @xmath79 are the first moments of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ( @xmath82 ) . for @xmath83 and @xmath84 we can adopt the results from the qcd sum rules and the bag model calculations  @xcite . as to @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ", we can use the experimental data analysis  @xcite or theoretical results , e.g. the qcd sum rules results  @xcite .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath87 at the scale of @xmath88  gev@xmath89 .    the realistic form of the distributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be taken from a fit to the experimental data for @xmath49 . in our calculations",
    "we use parametrization from ref .  @xcite . at this point",
    "we have to realize that , in spite of the expected relations  ( [ dud1 ] ) , distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are very different in their nature . especially at @xmath90 , where @xmath77 probably contains a singular contribution of the polarized sea quarks , but",
    "@xmath76 does not .",
    "therefore we expect eq .",
    "( [ hn2 ] ) to be a reasonable estimate in the region of the valence quarks dominance , say @xmath91 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "for completely consistent analysis , the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and the distributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 should be scaled to the same value of @xmath94 .",
    "however , for the sake of the unsophisticated estimates we do not go into such details .",
    "the results of calculation of the nucleon and deuteron structure functions , @xmath1 ( solid lines ) and @xmath14 ( dashed lines ) , are shown in fig .",
    "the group of curves 1 represents case ( [ ab1 ] ) , which is a possible lower limit for @xmath95 in accordance with our estimates ( [ ab3 ] ) .",
    "curves 2 represent the case @xmath96 , which is close to the mid point results of the bag model and the qcd sum rules .",
    "the upper limit corresponding to the estimates ( [ ab3 ] ) is presented by curves 3 .",
    "for all cases the deuteron structure function is suppressed compared to the one for the nucleon , mainly due to the depolarization effect of the d - wave in the deuteron .",
    "this is quite similar to the case of the structure functions @xmath49 and @xmath56 . to illustrate this similarity we show the ratio of the structure functions @xmath97 ( solid line ) in fig .  [ rat ] together with the ratio @xmath98 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the straight dash - dotted line in fig .  [ rat ] represents the value of the matrix elements ( [ sr2a ] ) and ( [ sr3a ] ) , which are not distinguishable on this scale .",
    "this line approximately corresponds to eqs .",
    "( [ sr4 ] ) and ( [ sr5 ] ) .",
    "note that our estimate of the nucleon structure function @xmath1 , ( [ ab3 ] ) , gives systematically a larger value for the function than naive suggestion ( [ ab1 ] ) , the curves 1 in fig .",
    "[ h-1d ] , which essentially corresponds to the estimate @xmath99 , neglecting possible negative contribution of the s - quark sea  @xcite .",
    "the large size of the effect suggests that it can be detected in future experiments with the deuterons  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the structure functions @xmath97 in this case is also shown in fig .  [ rat ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "we have considered the chiral - odd structure function of twist two , @xmath2 , and its first moment , the tensor charge of the deuteron . in particular ,    1 .",
    "the structure function of the deuteron is calculated in the bethe - salpeter formalism for the deuteron amplitude .",
    "explicit analytical and numerical results for the effective distribution function of the nucleons in the deuteron , defining the deuteron structure function @xmath14 are obtained .",
    "it is shown that the deuteron structure function @xmath2 exhibits deviation from the nucleon structure function @xmath1 similar to the case of the usual spin - dependent structure functions @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "the deuteron structure factor renormalizing the tensor charge of the nucleon in the deuteron is calculated .",
    "a simple phenomenologically motivated model for the evaluation of the nucleon function @xmath1 is suggested , using the available results of the qcd sum rules and the bag model for @xmath1 .",
    "the estimates show that the nucleon structure function , @xmath8 , can be significantly larger than the spin - dependent structure function after extraction of the averaged quark charge , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "this effect definitely can be tested experimentally in the semi - inclusive deep inelstic scattering and , therefore , can bring a better understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon .",
