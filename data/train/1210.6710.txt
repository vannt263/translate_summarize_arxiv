    "since discovery in 1991 @xcite , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have quickly developed as the working horse of nanotechnology , mostly owing to their remarkable electronic , mechanical and thermal properties , which facilitate a whole plethora of cnts applications . among them",
    "are new composite materials synthesized by adding cnts to various materials such as alloys , polymers , and metals . such composites constitute the extraordinary class of materials being very light and exhibiting simultaneously enhanced mechanical strength , electrical and thermal conductivity , and chemical stability @xcite .",
    "however , the fabrication of such nano - composites is hindered by the fact that the pristine cnts are not soluble in water or in organic solvents and have tendencies to create bundles .",
    "the common remedy of these problems is the functionalization of the cnts , in particular covalent functionalization with simple organic molecules ( such as -ch@xmath2 , -nh@xmath2 fragments , and -oh groups ) .",
    "these molecules adsorbed at the surface of cnts allow for strong binding of the functionalized in such a way cnts with matrix material , typically a polymer or a metal @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , functionalization to the side walls of cnts changes their morphology , generates defects @xcite , and could decrease the strength of the structure in comparison to the pristine cnts .",
    "therefore , it is very important to investigate the elastic properties of the functionalized cnts .",
    "it is also meaningful having in mind broad area of cnt applications in fields such as nanoelectronics or medicine .",
    "generally , the elastic properties of the functionalized cnts are rather poorly known , in contrast to the pristine ones@xcite . to close this gap",
    ", we have undertaken extensive and systematic _ ab initio _ studies of elastic properties of the functionalized cnts .",
    "the stability of the functionalized cnts has been also studied previously in a series of publications.@xcite .    in this paper , we consider prototypes of the cnts , namely single wall ( 9,0 ) , ( 10,0 ) and ( 11,0 ) cnts , covalently functionalized with simple organic fragments -nh , -nh@xmath0 , -ch@xmath0 , -ch@xmath1 and -oh . the molecules at various concentrations are attached to the side walls of cnts being evenly distributed over the cnt surfaces . for the functionalized systems ,",
    "we calculate first their equilibrium geometry and further their elastic moduli .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : det ] , we present calculation details .",
    "the results of the calculations are described and discussed in the third section - results and discussion. here we present : ( i ) how the functionalization procedure changes the equilibrium geometry of the functionalized systems , ( ii ) how the elastic moduli of the covalently functionalized cnts deviate from the elastic moduli of the pristine ones , and ( iii ) how these deviations depend on the concentration of the functionalizing molecules .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section conclusions. we consider three types of cnts : nominally metallic ( 9,0 ) , and semiconducting ( 10,0 ) and ( 11,0 ) .",
    "all of the cnts have been covalently functionalized by attaching to their lateral surface simple organic groups , such as -nh , -nh@xmath0 , -ch@xmath0 , -ch@xmath1 , and -oh .",
    "we examine those systems at various concentrations reaching up to 4.6@xmath310@xmath4 adsorbed molecules per @xmath5 of cnt s surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , in the present paper , we follow convention of the other authors and measure the concentration of the adsorbents as the number of attached molecules @xmath6 per doubled unit cell of pristine cnts , i.e. , per number of carbon atoms in the doubled unit cell @xmath7 equal to 72 , 80 , and 88 carbon atoms for ( 9,0 ) , ( 10,0 ) , and ( 11,0 ) cnts , respectively . to facilitate comparison between different cnts ,",
    "we express also the concentration of the adsorbed molecules as @xmath8 .",
    "we have considered all possible positions of the adsorbed fragments and determined these positions that lead to the minimum of the total energy of the functionalized cnts 11 , i.e. , the equilibrium geometry . only these positions are depicted in fig .",

    "-ch@xmath0 fragments in addition to the cross - sectional view also the top views of local arrangement of adsorbents and surrounding c atoms are presented .",
    "this shows that depending on the electronic configuration the fragments form either single chemical bond to the c atom from the cnt backbone ( -nh@xmath0 , -oh , and -ch@xmath1 ) , being in the so - called top position , or double bond ( as -ch@xmath0 and -nh ) with fragment s c atom placed in the bridge positions.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the total energies and components of stress tensor are obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculations in the framework of the density functional theory @xcite employing the following realization .",
    "we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation density functional @xcite and supercell geometry within the numerical package siesta @xcite . since in many cases we have to do with system with odd number of electrons , we employ spin - polarized version of the gga functional .",
    "a kinetic energy cut - off ( parameter meshcutoff in the siesta code ) of 300 ry and split double zeta basis set with spin polarization have been used in all calculations .",
    "each supercell contains two primitive unit cells along the cnt symmetry axis .",
    "the lateral separation ( i.e. , lateral lattice constants in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis ) has been set to 30  , just to eliminate completely the spurious interaction between neighboring cells .",
    "we use the self - consistency mixing rate of 0.1 , the convergence criterion for the density matrix of 10@xmath9 , maximum force tolerance equal to 0.01 ev /  , and 1x1x10 k - sampling in monkhorst pack scheme .",
    "the stability of the functionalized structures can be assessed by considering the adsorption energy @xmath10 defined below ( and sometimes called packing energy @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the total energies of the functionalized cnts with the optimized unit cell lengths and atomic geometry , pristine one , and one functionalizing molecule , respectively .",
    "the functionalized cnts change their lattice constants @xmath15 along the symmetry axis and radii @xmath16 in comparison to pristine ones .",
    "these parameters take the values that minimize @xmath12 with the optimized positions of all atoms in the supercell ( i.e. , with vanishing all forces on atoms ) .",
    "since the cross - sections of the functionalized cnts in the plane perpendicular to the cnt symmetry axis , are not circular any more , we determine average radius @xmath16 of the functionalized nanotubes as geometrical average of carbon atom positions on the cnt surface .",
    "since we use the numerical code with the localized basis , the basis set superposition error ( bsse ) correction should be taken into account .",
    "we have calculated this correction following the well established procedure @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are kohn - sham energies of the functionalized system but where the adsorbents or nanotube are replaced by their ghosts @xcite , respectively .",
    "these calculations have been performed with atomic sites fixed to their equilibrium positions .",
    "@xmath20 corrects values of @xmath10 by approximately 11@xmath21 to 44 @xmath21 and does not change the conclusions about stability of functionalized systems@xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that the bsse correction to the adsorption energy originates mostly from the calculation of the total energies of free groups @xmath14 .",
    "these energies when calculated with the basis functions connected to few atoms differ considerably from energies calculated employing full basis of the whole functionalized system .",
    "the role of bsse correction gets completely negligible when one calculates equilibrium geometry of the functionalized systems or elastic properties , since these quantities are determined on the basis of total energies for the whole functionalized systems where the bases are identical ( up to atomic positions ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by calculating @xmath22/@xmath23 according to the procedure described in the ref.@xcite .",
    "having determined equilibrium geometry of the functionalized cnts , we are in the position to calculate their elastic moduli .",
    "to do so , we strain ( usually we apply tensile strain ) the functionalized cnts along the symmetry axis by @xmath24 and calculate the response .    the most interesting quantity , young s modulus , has been determined in two ways :    \\(i ) - by comparing the total energy of unstrained ( @xmath25 ) and strained ( @xmath26 ) systems    @xmath27    where @xmath15 is a lattice constant along the axis of the functionalized tube , @xmath24 is elongation in the chosen direction , and @xmath28 is volume of the unstressed system , and ( ii ) from components ( @xmath29 ) of the stress tensor @xmath30 .",
    "volume of the pure cnt has been calculated using following relation @xmath31 , where thickness @xmath32 has been chosen as double van der waals radius of c atom ( equal to 0.34 nm ) @xcite . in the case of functionalized cnt",
    ", we neglect volume of the attached molecules .    bulk modulus and shear modulus have been also calculated according to the formulas : @xmath33    we have also calculated the bbse corrections to the elastic moduli .",
    "these corrections modify the values of young s moduli by maximally 10@xmath21 and do not change the conclusion presented in this article .    at the end , we can compute the poisson ratio values as follows @xmath34 , where @xmath35 describes the change of the average radius of the functionalized cnt that has been caused by the applied strain @xmath24 .",
    "we have studied the stability and electronic structure of covalently functionalized cnts in previous works @xcite .",
    "we have also shown there how the functionalization induces changes in morphology of the functionalized systems and leads to the redistribution of electronic charge .",
    "all of the functionalizing fragments considered in the present study induce rehybridization from sp@xmath36 to sp@xmath37 of c - c bonds in neighborhood of the attachment , but in many cases we have found out that some of the adsorbed molecules also cause stronger deformation of cnt backbone structure .",
    "these pronounced changes in the morphology of the functionalized cnts we observed motivated us to study the global strength of the functionalized cnts expressed by the elastic moduli .",
    "before we turn to the discussion of the elastic properties , we would like to present shortly the stability of the functionalized cnts , and the change of geometry ( lattice constant and radius ) caused by the functionalization .    the adsorption energy ( per adsorbed molecule ) for all considered functionalizing molecules",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for the prototypical metallic ( 9,0 ) cnt .",
    "it is seen that all the considered molecules bind to the surface of the ( 9,0 ) cnt ( i.e. , the adsorption energy is negative )",
    ". however , the strength of the bonding is larger for typical radicals ( -nh and -ch@xmath0 ) then for the non - radicals ( -nh@xmath0 , -ch@xmath1 , and -oh ) .",
    "this we would like to correlate with the induced changes of geometry and elastic moduli later on . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , generally , the adsorption energy per molecule remains nearly constant with increasing number of attached molecules . only for the strong radical -nh",
    ", the adsorption energy per molecule gets less negative ( indicating that the bonding weakens ) with increasing number of attached fragments .",
    "this trend obeys also for semiconducting ( 10,0 ) and ( 11,0 ) cnts , as it has been illustrated for -ch@xmath0 and -oh adsorbents in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",

    "it is depicted for the ( 9,0 ) cnt in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and  [ fig : fig5 ] . for example , radius and lattice constant of pure ( 9,0 ) cnt equals to 3.592 @xmath38 and 8.590  , respectively . for ( 9,0 ) cnt functionalized with 9 -ch@xmath0 molecules per unit cell , the radius increases to 3.715 @xmath38(by 3.31@xmath21 ) and the lattice constant reaches 8.726 @xmath38 ( increase by 1.58@xmath21 ) .",
    "generally , one can say that functionalization of ( 9,0 ) cnt acts as an effective tensile strain , which blows up pristine cnt .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for molecules that built strong covalent bonds to the cnt walls .",

    ". for maximal considered concentration of 12.5% , the relative changes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in comparison to the length and radius of the pristine cnts are equal to 1.56% and 3.31% , respectively .",
    "this effect is much weaker for -ch@xmath1 functionalized cnt , where percentage change of @xmath15 is equal to 0.34% , whereas the change of @xmath16 equals 0.92% .",
    "the relative changes in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameters induced by functionalization depend rather slowly on metallic - semiconducting character of cnts and their diameter .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "as it was determined previously@xcite -ch@xmath0 radicals bind strongly to the cnt surfaces and at higher concentrations can lead to some local structural defects ( so - called 5 - 7 defects ) .",
    "on the other hand , the functionalization with -oh groups slightly changes the cross - section of cnt - from circle to ellipse .",
    "therefore , we have decided to compare ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) both types of attachments for all of the cnts studied : ( 9,0 ) , ( 10,0 ) and ( 11,0 ) .",
    "we have noticed , for the biggest considered concentration of 12.5@xmath21 , that ( 9,0 ) cnt functionalized with -ch@xmath0 shows the biggest percentage change ( 3.31@xmath21 ) of radius in comparison to ( 10,0 ) and ( 11,0 ) cnts ( where percentage changes are equal to 2.83@xmath21 and 1.81@xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "the -oh groups follow the similar trend , however , the functionalization induced changes of the radius are weaker .",

    "<S> the studies are based on the first principles calculations in the framework of density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the changes in the geometry and the elastic moduli of the functionalized cnts as a function of the density of adsorbed molecules . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that elastic moduli diminish with increasing concentration of adsorbents , however , the functionalized cnts remain strong enough to be suitable for reinforcement of composites . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest effect is observed for cnts functionalized with -ch@xmath0 radical , where the young s modulus of the functionalized system is by 30% smaller than in the pristine cnts . </S>"
