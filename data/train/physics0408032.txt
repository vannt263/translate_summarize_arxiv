    "organic liquid scintillators are used in large quantities for rare event detection in particle astrophysics .",
    "the main objective in these experiments is the real time spectroscopy of neutrinos from steady - state sources such as the sun , nuclear reactors and from beta decays in the crust and mantle of the earth , as well as from transient sources such as supernovae .    despite the large target mass of several hundreds of tons ,",
    "the signal rates of the steady - state sources are typically in the range of a few events per day down to a few events per year at mev or sub - mev energies .",
    "thus , background signal rates created by radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions need to be extremely low .",
    "low backgrounds can be achieved by locating the detectors deep underground to suppress the cosmic ray muon flux , shielding the scintillator target against the ambient radioactivity from the surrounding rocks , and suppressing and removing radioactive impurities present in trace amounts in the detector and ancillary systems as well as in the liquid scintillator itself .",
    "this concept of background reduction has been pioneered by the borexino collaboration @xcite in the counting test facility ( ctf ) @xcite and is implemented in the borexino detector , and similarly , in the kamland experiment @xcite .",
    "this paper summarizes the study of 1,2dimethyl4(1phenylethyl)benzene ( phenyl  o  xylylethane , pxe ) , a new scintillator solvent the key characteristics of which are its high density ( @xmath54 ) and high flash point ( 145@xmath55c ) .",
    "this scintillator solvent has been investigated as a ` back - up solution ' for the borexino experiment .",
    "the design of choice is based on 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene ( pseudocumene , pc ) , both as buffer liquid and as neutrino target .",
    "since the density of pxe is close to that of water , even large scintillator targets can be submerged in water - serving as a shield against ambient radiation - while creating only modest buoyancy forces on the scintillator containment vessel . moreover , a detector with water as shield and pxe as target material provides a substantial higher fiducial target mass because of the improved shielding performance against external radiation compared to a detector with identical dimensions , but with both shield and target of organic liquids with standard densities ( @xmath56  g/@xmath57 ) . finally , a pxe - water configuration reduces the overall inventory of organic liquid in the detector systems , e.g. to about one fourth in the case of borexino .",
    "this , depending on national regulations , may have an impact on the legal classification of the detector systems and therefore on the safety and operational aspects of the experiment .",
    "a further asset of pxe is its high flash point simplifying safety systems relevant for transportation , handling and storage . according to regulations by the united nations ( un )",
    ", pxe is legally non - hazardous for transportation purposes and no special united nation number code applies @xcite . in a paper by majewski et al .",
    "@xcite pxe has been described as a relatively safe solvent with very low toxicity compared to standard liquid scintillators .",
    "the double chooz reactor neutrino experiment @xcite , aiming at a measurement of the mixing angle @xmath58 , will use as target a scintillator mixture based on pxe .",
    "the study reported here of pxe as a solvent for a low - background scintillator for solar neutrino spectroscopy was carried out within the borexino project .",
    "research on pxe scintillators started in 1995 with laboratory measurements focusing on optical properties and radio purification techniques with solid columns .",
    "after completion of the laboratory scale study , about five tons of pxe solvent for testing on prototype scale with the counting test facility ( ctf ) of borexino were acquired in 1996 .",
    "fluors were added on site in hall c of the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) and the final scintillator was purified with module-0 , a solid column purification and liquid handling system @xcite .",
    "the ctf was loaded with pxe scintillator in october 1996 and first data were acquired until january 1997 . the quality of data was limited because only a small fraction of the photomultipliers in the ctf were operational .",
    "the pxe scintillator was unloaded from the ctf after the shut down of the detector in july 1997 , and moved back into the storage tanks of module-0 .",
    "further batch purification operations were carried out during the period october until december 1997 .",
    "samples for neutron activation analysis were taken to monitor the achieved radio purity after each operation .",
    "after reconstruction of the ctf during 1999 , the pxe scintillator was reloaded into the ctf and measured from june to september 2000 .",
    "the main objective during this period was the analysis of radio purity and optical properties in a large volume detector . beyond this scope ,",
    "physics limits on electron instability @xcite , nucleon instability @xcite , neutrino magnetic properties @xcite , and on violations of the pauli exclusion principle @xcite could be derived from measurements with the pxe scintillator .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section  2 summarizes the physical and chemical properties of the pxe solvent .",
    "section  3 describes the optical properties of the solvent as well as the mixed scintillator .",
    "section  4 is dedicated to the large scale test of the pxe scintillator with the ctf including the scintillator preparation , purification and analysis of trace impurities , and conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "pxe is a clear , colorless liquid with an aromatic odor .",
    "it is an industrial product with different applications , as for example : insulating oil in high voltage transformers and capacitors and as oil for pressure sensitive paper .",
    "pxe is produced by reacting styrene and xylene using an acidic catalyst .",
    "it is then washed with water and distilled to improve the purity .",
    "its final industrial purification step uses a solid column .",
    "pxe has the molecular formula @xmath59 with a weight of 210.2 g / mol .",
    "its molecular structure is shown in figure[f : pxemol ] .",
    "chemical and physical details which are of relevance for detector design , safety and operational aspects are listed in table[t : pxe - chem - phys ] .",
    "the key features are its high density of 0.988  g/@xmath57 , its low vapor pressure and high flash point of 145  @xmath55c .",
    "it is therefore classified as a non - hazardous liquid .    for our test , the standard production scheme at koch chemical company , corpus christi , texas",
    ", usa was modified omitting the final column purification at the company , since it was expected that the clay column material might leach off radio active impurities , such as uranium and thorium . instead a column purification system was built and operated using silica gel in the underground laboratories of the lngs .",
    "details are discussed below .",
    "the optical and scintillation properties of the pure pxe solvent , of selected fluors , and of pxe - fluor mixtures have been investigated by uv / vis spectrometry , by fluorimetry and by excitation with ionizing radiation .",
    "the objective was to optimize the scintillator performance by maximizing its light yield and attenuation length and minimizing its scintillation decay time .",
    "methods to remove optical impurities were studied , since impurities can potentially reduce light yield and attenuation length .",
    "all optical properties presented in this section are derived from laboratory size samples up to a few hundred ml s .",
    "attenuation length measurements typically are done in ` one - dimension ' only .",
    "scattered light , elastic or inelastic , is undetectable in these measurements whereas in large volume applications with 4@xmath60 geometry , the scattered photons are not necessarily lost .",
    "the performance of the pxe scintillator in a large volume detector , taking scattering into account , has been studied in ctf and is discussed in sec .",
    "pxe diluted in cyclohexane shows an absorption maximum at 267 nm . the emission spectrum after excitation at this wavelength peaks at about 290 nm as displayed in figure  [ f : pxe - emi - abs ] .",
    "the fluorescence lifetime after excitation at @xmath61 measured in diluted solutions of cyclohexane shows an exponential decay with a lifetime @xmath62 of @xmath63ns .",
    "preliminary samples obtained from koch had various optical impurities with absorption bands around 300 , 325 , 360 and 380 nm .",
    "they could be observed both by uv / vis and fluorimetric measurements . passing the solvent through a column with acidic alumina reduced the absorption peaks . the band at 380 nm was reduced most efficiently .",
    "the pxe used for the 5  t test , as described section 4 , still had various optical impurities , but at much reduced levels .",
    "the attenuation length at 430 nm ( @xmath64 ) , defined as @xmath65 , with the initial intensity @xmath66 and attenuated intensity @xmath67 after the optical path length @xmath68 , was @xmath69 in the pure pxe solvent .",
    "attenuation lengths were measured with a varian cary 400 uv / vis photospectrometer in 10 cm cuvettes .",
    "a tertiary scintillator system was chosen in order to shift the emission wavelength to about 430 nm , well above the absorption bands of the residual optical impurities .",
    "this is achieved by using 1,4-diphenylbenzene ( para - terphenyl , p - tp ) as primary solute and 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene ( bis - msb ) as secondary solute .",
    "absorption and emission spectra of pxe in cyclohexane and those of the fluors in pxe are shown in figures  [ f : pxe - emi - abs ] and [ f : pxe - fluors ] .",
    "the latter shows that the emission spectrum of p - tp is satisfactorily matched by the absorption spectrum of the wavelength shifter bis - msb , and therefore an efficient energy transfer is expected in this solvent .",
    "the scintillator properties were tested with p - tp concentrations at 2 and 3  g / l ( close to the solubility limit ) and with bis - msb at 20  mg / l . a scintillation yield of 88  ( 93)% for pxe with an addition of p - tp ( 2.0 ( 3.0 )  g / l)/bis - msb(20",

    "l of 2,5-diphenyloxazole ( ppo ) has been found ( uncorrected for the pmt sensitivity ) .",
    "attenuation lengths of @xmath70  m to 3.2  m of the scintillator mixture have been measured depending on the sample treatment ( cf .",
    "section 4.2 ) .",
    "the fluorescence decay time of the p - tp(2.0  g / l)/bis - msb(20  mg",
    "/ l ) scintillator mixture measured by fluorimetry after excitation at 267 nm shows a fast component @xmath71 of 3.7  ns . at 3",
    "g / l p - tp , the decay constant is shortened to 3.2  ns .",
    "the photon emission probability density function ( pdf ) was further studied with ionizing radiation in order to investigate the contribution of long lived triplet states and the possibility to use the emission time for discrimination of alpha versus beta particles ( pulse shape discrimination ) .",
    "the response to gamma radiation has been measured for a concentration of 2.0",
    "g / l and 3.0  g / l p - tp with a @xmath72cs source , and to alpha radiation at a concentration of 3.0",
    "g / l using a @xmath73po alpha source @xcite .",
    "the pdf can be parametrized by the weighted sum of four exponentials @xmath74 with the parameters given in table [ t : em ] .",
    "the emission time distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fpxecs137a ] .",
    "in addition to an increased slow component which can be used for pulse shape discrimination , alpha particles emit less light because of the high ionization density compared to electron or gamma radiation .",
    "the quenching factor is mainly solvent dependent and has been measured for different alpha decays in the @xmath1u chain , using @xmath75rn  loaded scintillator .",
    "the results are given in table[t : quench ]  @xcite .",
    "light attenuation of the standard mixture ( pxe/(2.0 g / l)p - tp/(20 mg / l)bis - msb ) which has been used in the ctf ( cf .",
    "4 ) has been measured at various steps during the preparation of the scintillator in 1996 and after filling the ctf .",
    "after several purification steps of the mixed scintillator through a silica gel column in module-0 in order to remove radio - impurities ( cf .",
    "sections below ) , attenuation lengths in the range between 2.6 and 3.0  m at 430  nm were measured .",
    "after completion of the pxe measurements with ctf and subsequent batch purification operations , the scintillator has been stored in barrels under nitrogen atmosphere . in 2003 , this scintillator was used in the frame of the lens project  @xcite and optical properties were remeasured to check for degradation with time .",
    "the attenuation length as well as the light yield were unchanged with respect to the measurements in 1996 .",
    "passing this scintillator mixture through a weak acidic alumina column increased the attenuation lengths to 12  m as displayed in figure  [ fpxeatt ]   while retaining the scintillation yield @xcite .",
    "the main objectives of the large scale test in the borexino prototype detector ( counting test facility , ctf @xcite ) were the study of 1 ) optical properties on a large scale , 2 ) achievable levels of radioactive trace contaminations of the pxe based scintillator , 3 ) the performance of scintillator purification with a silica gel column , and 4 ) of the liquid handling system , module-0 .",
    "the purity levels required for detection of low - energy solar neutrinos , in particular neutrinos from the @xmath76be electron capture , are at the @xmath77bq / m@xmath78 level corresponding to concentration of @xmath1u  and @xmath79th  of @xmath80  g / g . for detailed specifications of solar neutrino rates and background requirements ,",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "as the @xmath1u  progenies @xmath75rn , @xmath73pb , @xmath73bi and @xmath73po are not necessarily in equilibrium with the progenitor activity , we studied the contamination levels of @xmath1u  ( as well as @xmath79th  and several other isotopes ) _ directly _ with neutron activation analysis ( naa ) at levels of @xmath81g / g and below .",
    "the short lived progenies are not accessible with naa .",
    "their contamination levels were studied in the ctf together with other backgrounds , as for example the radiogenic produced @xmath51c .",
    "new techniques to remove radioactive isotopes by solid column purification were tested for the first time in a ton scale experiment .",
    "furthermore , the preparation , handling and purification of several tons of liquid scintillator with module-0 was the first test of a subsystem of the liquid handling system to be used in the scintillator operations in borexino .",
    "about five tons of pxe solvent was procured from koch special chemical company , texas , usa . to ensure a controlled procedure , the solvent was loaded by us at the company site in three specially modified and cleaned stainless steel transport containers and shipped to the gran sasso underground laboratories .",
    "the pxe solvent was transferred from the transport containers into module-0 , a liquid handling and purification system , specially built for the pxe test .",
    "it can be used for volumetric loading and unloading of liquid scintillator to / from the ctf inner vessel ( iv ) , for fluor mixing , purification of liquid scintillator with a silica gel column , rn degassing of liquid scintillator by nitrogen sparging , and spray degassing as well as for water extraction .",
    "module-0 consists of a high and low pressure manifold system which are connected by pumps to build up the pressure difference of typically 2  atm .",
    "the manifolds are connected to tanks , columns , filters etc . to allow a variety of flow paths and operations .",
    "the system includes two 7  m@xmath78 electropolished pressure tanks ( ep1/2 ) , two 1  m@xmath78 process tanks ( bt1/2 ) equipped with nitrogen spargers at the bottom and spray nozzles at the top ( for a turbulent injection of liquid together with nitrogen gas ) , pumps , flow meters , millipore filters ( 0.5 , 0.1 and 0.05micron ) and one 70l high pressure column purification unit .",
    "all tanks are connected to a high purity nitrogen gas system to provide a nitrogen blanket at typically 30  mbar overpressure .",
    "the complete system has been designed according to ultra - high - vacuum standards to avoid contaminations from the environmental air , in particular of @xmath75rn and @xmath82kr .",

    "details about the up - graded system are given in @xcite .",
    "the fluors ( p - terphenyl and bis - msb , both from sigma - aldrich co. , scintillation grade ) were sieved and then added without further purification to ep1 through a glove box connected to the top inlet flange which was flushed with nitrogen while the pxe solvent was agitated with a nitrogen flux from the bottom inlet to facilitate dissolving p - tp . to accelerate the solvation of p - tp ,",
    "the ep1 tank was heated to 38  @xmath55c for four days under continuous nitrogen agitation .",

    "the scintillator components had been mixed as received from the supplier ; no special pretreatment had been given to the fluor and the wavelength shifter .",

    "the complete scintillator had passed once a column of about 80 cm height ( 15  kg ) which had been exchanged against fresh silica gel after the first two tons had run through the column , and once with a height of about 50 cm , i.e. in total two times .",

    "direct counting after first loading of the pxe scintillator into the ctf in 1997 did not provide conclusive results because of photo - tube and electronics problems of the detector system that hindered data evaluation .",

    "figure  [ 793resol ] ) .",

    "the photon arrival time distribution was studied with the source located at the center of the detector .",
    "figure  [ f : beta ]   displays the time distribution for scintillation photons from the @xmath94bi  beta decay .",

    "monte carlo and data show good agreement for arrival times up to 25ns .",
    "the data show a larger slow component than the mc simulation , which could be due to reflected photons and/or pmt late pulses which are not fully accounted for in the simulation .    to distinguish alpha from beta particles by pulse shape discrimination , the analog sum of the charge signal from all pmts is split into three identical signals and fed into a charge sensitive adc with different time delays .",

    "the @xmath109 acceptance efficiency at 98  % leads to an @xmath107 identification efficiency of 84.6% ; applying a radial cut on the @xmath94bi  and @xmath94po  events of @xmath110 cm leads to an increased @xmath107 identification efficiency of 92.4% .",
    "this improvement is due to the fact that for events in the outer regions of the inner vessel the difference in the light path to different pmts is higher , and therefore the fraction of light registered at late times is higher .",
    "also other methods for @xmath111 discrimination like the gatti optimum filter method have been studied with the ctf @xcite , and will be implemented in borexino .",
    "the counting rate below 200kev is dominated by the @xmath51c  beta decay with an endpoint of 156kev .",
    "the @xmath51c  concentration in the scintillator was determined by fitting a convolution of the theoretical beta spectrum and the energy dependent detector resolution function , plus a background contribution to the measured spectrum in the energy range from 70 to 150kev @xcite . the low energy spectrum together with the fit is displayed in figure  [ f : c14-ctf2 ] .",
    "at energies below 70kev there is a background contribution from cherenkov events produced by @xmath93 s in the shielding water . from the fit we derive the @xmath51c  activity which translates to a ratio of @xmath112 .",
    "the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty of the total scintillator mass .",
    "the @xmath1u   decay chain is assayed via the delayed coincidence of the @xmath75rn  progenies @xmath94bi  ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath94po  ( @xmath107 ) with a half life of 164@xmath77s . assuming secular equilibrium of the decay chain  which is likely to be broken due to the long - lived @xmath114ra  and the gaseous @xmath75rn the measured @xmath94bi-@xmath94po  activity can be expressed as uranium - equivalent .",
    "after loading the ctf an initial @xmath94bi-@xmath94po  rate of about 90 counts per day was observed which was clearly related to @xmath75rn  introduced during the filling process , as it decayed away with the @xmath75rn  half life of 3.8 days .",
    "the last two 1-week - periods of data taking with a total counting time of 7.32 days ( period i ) and 6.98days ( period ii ) were used for the analysis , when the contribution from the initial @xmath75rn  contamination was below 1 count per day . the detector efficiency ( due to the dead time connected with",
    "the read out of each event ) was 91% during that period .",
    "the @xmath94bi-@xmath94po  events were selected by applying the following cuts : no muon veto trigger ( efficiency @xmath115 99% ) ; energy of the first event @xmath115 300kev ( efficiency 95% ) ; energy of the following event between 0.6 and 1.25mev ( 99% ) ; coincidence time between 5@xmath77s and 800@xmath77s ( 94% ) .",
    "224 ( 199 ) candidate events survived the cuts for period",
    "i ( ii ) , corresponding to a @xmath75rn  activity of 102@xmath77bq / m@xmath78 ( 99@xmath77bq / m@xmath78 ) .",
    "this activity however was not homogeneously distributed within the scintillator volume , but most of the events were localized along the vertical symmetry axis of the detector .",
    "an artefact due to false reconstruction could be excluded after calibration with point like sources which were located both on and off axis .",
    "though the origin of these events could not be fully resolved , it is excluded that they are related to the intrinsic scintillator impurities . to derive a number for the residual @xmath75rn  concentration homogeneously distributed in the scintillator ,",
    "a cylindrical cut around the vertical axis was applied .",
    "for @xmath116 we get a @xmath75rn  activity of @xmath117 in period i and @xmath118 in period ii , or a @xmath1u  equivalent concentration of @xmath119 and @xmath120 . due to",
    "the above stated @xmath75rn  problem this value must be considered as an upper limit of the internal @xmath1u  contamination .",
    "further radio - isotopes from the uranium decay chain of concern are the @xmath73pb progenies @xmath73bi and @xmath73po .",
    "secular equilibrium typically is disturbed even within this sub - chain , as well as with respect to the progenitor @xmath114ra because of the characteristic lifetimes and the different chemistries involved . from a spectral analysis , about 100 to 200 decays per day with alpha - like pulse shapes and with energy depositions quenched to approximately 0.5  mev are attributed to @xmath73po decays in the scintillator @xcite .",
    "a limit for the intrinsic @xmath79th  contamination can be derived via the delayed @xmath109-@xmath107 coincidence of its progenies @xmath121bi-@xmath121po with a half life of 299ns .",
    "it can be distinguished from the @xmath94bi-@xmath94po  coincidence by the higher energy of the @xmath107 decay and the shorter coincidence time , though the latter has to be considered as a background .",
    "secular equilibrium in the @xmath79th  chain is usually observed for @xmath122th and its progenies .",
    "the following cuts were applied to select the @xmath121bi-@xmath121po events : no muon veto trigger ; energy of the first event @xmath115 300kev ( efficiency 85% ) ; energy of the second event @xmath115 800kev ( 100% ) ; coincidence time between 50 and 1500ns ( 86% ) ; due to a contamination at the bottom of the vessel only decays in the upper hemisphere of the detector were considered ( 50% ) .",
    "the overall efficiency of the cuts for the selection of the @xmath121bi-@xmath121po events is 37% . during the whole period of undisturbed data taking , in total 25.8days of live time ,",
    "12 candidates were detected , leading to a @xmath79th  equivalent concentration of @xmath123 .",
    "an estimation of the remaining background for the neutrino detection in borexino is provided by the subtraction of all known contributions from the background spectrum measured in the ctf . in order to reduce the contribution from the external background ,",
    "a radial cut ( @xmath124 m ) has been applied .",
    "also , all correlated events have been tagged and discriminated . in the neutrino window ( nw , @xmath125 ) ,",
    "the counting rate then is 120 events per day and ton . as next step ,",
    "all muon induced events have been subtracted ( 74 events per day and ton ) . in this inner region of the detector , alphas can be discriminated via their pulse shape with an efficiency of @xmath126% , leading to 48 events per day and ton .",
    "the resulting background spectrum is shown in figure  [ internalback ] .",
    "clearly visible are the contributions from @xmath51c the remaining alphas from the @xmath1u  and @xmath79th  chain , and a @xmath127k  @xmath93 peak , which could be identified as external background originating from the vectran strings that hold the inner vessel in place ( a dedicated measurement of the strings showed a concentration of 45 ppm k ) .",
    "the large scale test of a scintillator based on pxe in the ctf showed that its optical properties and the detector performance are comparable to a pseudocumene based scintillator .",
    "the purity levels required for the detection of low energy solar neutrinos can be achieved by purification of the scintillator with a silica gel column . though the very low @xmath1u  and @xmath79th  concentrations measured by naa ( @xmath128g / g and @xmath129g / g ) could not be confirmed by the ctf measurements , the remaining activity levels were close to the detector s sensitivity limit and largely influenced by systematics e.g. due to external background and surface contamination .",
    "pxe based scintillator has been investigated for application in borexino as detector medium for low energy solar neutrino spectroscopy .",
    "key questions under study were the optical properties , radio purity and new techniques of purification by solid column extraction .",
    "both laboratory measurements and the large scale operations in the ctf showed that pxe scintillator as target and water as buffer medium is a viable solution for borexino and it was rated as a backup solution .",
    "the default configuration in the borexino design is based on pseudocumene as scintillator as well as buffer medium .    because of its superior safety characteristics and the better self - shielding due to its higher density , future applications of pxe in underground experiments are conceivable , as for example the search for non - vanishing value of @xmath58 with reactor neutrinos , the search for neutrinoless double beta decay with metal loaded scintillators , the study of neutrinos from the interior of the earth and from supernovae , as well as the study of proton decay via the k - meson decay channel .",
