    "in the preceding paper @xcite , we presented a study of large orders of a variational method which provides convergent sequences of approximations for the quantum anharmonic oscillator . in this method",
    ", we introduced a mass term ( with a mass @xmath0 ) in the free lagrangian and subtracted it in the interaction part .",
    "then , we optimized at any order in terms of this variational parameter @xmath0 to get approximate values of different quantities .",
    "we have in perspective the use of such a method in quantum field theory . for fermions like those of the gross - neveu model @xcite , or qcd quarks ,",
    "introduction of a mass term causes _ a priori _ no problem , but for gluons it would break gauge invariance , and there is no obvious modification of the momentum dependent part of the gluon propagator and the structure of the ultraviolet infinities of the theory .",
    "however , a space compactification might provide some good approximation of quark confinement , like in the m.i.t .",
    "bag model @xcite .    in the m.i.t .",
    "bag model , the bag is a fundamental ingredient of the theory , which hence is not qcd , while we would advocate here an approach in which it would be added to the free gluon and quark action in the form of a modification of their propagators , the subtraction of this modification being done in perturbation theory . while formally when going to all orders one would have done nothing , and still be dealing with qcd , a finite given order would have to be optimized in the size of the bag as the closest one could get to the infinite order case .",
    "the advantage would be that different physics would be involved , hopefully closer to that of the full theory , with confinement , etc ",
    "compactification as an intermediate step in calculations in infrared divergent field theories has already been considered by several authors @xcite , with reasonable success .",
    "these authors usually treat the theory in a spatial box of length @xmath1 , and extrapolate the results to @xmath2 .",
    "we are here advocating a different , if related , strategy , in which the box is in some sense subtracted perturbatively , and the calculation at a given order in perturbation theory optimized with respect to the size of the box , this being supposed to mimick as well as it can the true all - orders theory , where formally there is no dependence at all on the size of the box .    in this paper",
    ", we try out this idea on the case of the anharmonic oscillator , choosing an action with compactified time as our starting point .",
    "we find a configuration for the optima and the approximate values of the ground state energy very similar to those of the harmonic approach of this problem @xcite . in the second section",
    ", we study the interaction part of the action to be used in order to formally leave the total action of a pure anharmonic oscillator unchanged .",
    "we make a choice which allows relatively simple perturbative calculations starting from a theory governed by a compactified action .",
    "the perturbation theory for such a compactified action is considered in the third section . in the fourth section ,",
    "we establish the variational - perturbative expansion of the mean value of the hamiltonian and optimize it in terms of our variational parameter ( the size of the box ) up to order @xmath3 .",
    "we interpret the configuration of the extrema using the large order behavior of the expansion , which is qualitatively much the same as in the harmonic approach of the previous paper , to which we compare our results .",
    "they turn out to be less accurate numerically for similar orders in the approximation , which reflects the fact that approximating an anharmonic potential by a compact time dimension is much worse than approximating it by a harmonic potential",
    ". nevertheless , the convergence properties are qualitatively very similar .",
    "the euclidean action for a pure anharmonic oscillator writes : @xmath4\\ ; dt\\;.\\ ] ]    severe infrared divergences prevent any perturbation in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "a way to tame these divergences is of course to introduce an @xmath6 term as was done in the previous paper . here",
    ", we would instead like to replace in some sense the free term of the action of equation ( 1 ) by the compactified free action @xmath7 :    @xmath8    and rewrite the total action @xmath9 as : @xmath10 then , we will be able to perform a perturbative expansion of any quantity in powers of the interaction term @xmath11 around the free term @xmath7 . to do so , let us consider the euclidean action @xmath12 of a time compactified pure anharmonic oscillator    @xmath13\\;dt.\\ ] ]    with @xmath12 , one can compute in perturbation theory in powers of @xmath5 at any given @xmath14 ( provided one uses appropriate boundary conditions , see below ) . to see how @xmath9 and @xmath12 may be related , we perform the following change of variable : @xmath15",
    "under which the action @xmath12 becomes : @xmath16\\;dx.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we can rewrite the action @xmath9 as @xmath17\\;dx,\\ ] ] where , strictly speaking , @xmath18 . comparing ( 7 ) with the expression of the compactified action ( 6 ) , we see how to relate @xmath9 and @xmath12 : following the procedure of the previous paper , one computes the quantity of interest to some order in @xmath5 using @xmath12 , sets @xmath19 , expands in powers of @xmath20 to the same total order as in @xmath5 , sets @xmath18 and optimizes the result with respect to @xmath21 . this should provide us with an approximate value of the same quantity computed with @xmath9 .    in more detail , we can consider the action ( 7 ) as:@xmath22with @xmath7 given by @xmath23 and @xmath24\\;dx.\\ ] ]    the @xmath25 order in perturbation will contain all the terms proportional to @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "note that in this approach , we do not take into account the complete quartic term of ( 4 ) but that we reconstruct it more and more accurately as the order of perturbation increases .",
    "this feature does not seem to us to carry any pathology , but simply follows from the choice of @xmath12 as our compactified action and the physics it contains .    this new choice for a free kinetic term parameterized by @xmath21 in @xmath9 will give rise for every finite order @xmath28 of perturbation to an explicit dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "because the total action @xmath9 remains unchanged at @xmath18 , one expects this parameter @xmath21 to become irrelevant at infinite order of perturbation .",
    "as already explained , this suggests to fix this parameter by looking for the regions where the result to order @xmath28 is stationary in @xmath21 .",
    "let us now discuss briefly the boundary conditions in the action of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "periodic conditions @xmath29 are unsuitable for perturbation theory , as the gaussian kernel has an isolated zero eigenvalue .",
    "similarly for neumann boundary conditions .",
    "hence , we shall use dirichlet boundary conditions in which    @xmath30    which preserves the discrete @xmath31 symmetry . with this choice ,",
    "all infrared problems disappear at finite @xmath14 .    in order to compare the results obtained by this compact time method to those of the harmonic one @xcite",
    ", we would like to consider the ground state energy .",
    "however , the method we described above implies calculation using a compactified action which is therefore not invariant under translation in time .",
    "then , the ground state energy is not a meaningful concept and we choose instead to consider the mean value of the hamiltonian operator at some time @xmath32 : @xmath33 the variation over the size of the box @xmath14 provides some new approach of the limit @xmath34 ( substituting @xmath35 , expanding in powers of @xmath20 and taking @xmath18 ) . in the limit of infinite order of perturbation ,",
    "the box should disappear and we should recover the value of the ground state energy when calculating @xmath36 .",
    "in the euclidean path integral representation , the mean value of the hamiltonian operator at time @xmath32 in the box writes : @xmath37 where @xmath38}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\<0;t \\mid 0;-t>&=&\\int_{\\phi_{\\pm t}=0 } d \\phi   \\ ; e^{- s_{t}[\\phi]}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ - s_{t}[\\phi]&=&- \\int_{-t}^{t } \\bigl [ { 1\\over 2 } { ( \\partial_t\\phi)}^2_t+{\\lambda\\over 4 } \\phi^4_t\\bigr ] \\,dt \\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mbox{and } \\hspace{3cm}h_{t_0}&=&-{1\\over 2 } { ( \\partial_t\\phi)}^2_{t_0}+{\\lambda\\over 4 }   \\phi^4_{t_0}\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      dividing by the partition function @xmath39 in ( 12 ) cancels all the disconnected feynman diagrams .",
    "we rewrite it:@xmath40here , in the schrdinger representation , the evolution operator @xmath41 of a quantum system described by @xmath42 appears .",
    "it satisfies the following equations : @xmath43 then , taking the derivative of the partition function with respect to the size of the box , we get :    @xmath44    so that @xmath45.\\ ] ] thus , the mean value of the hamiltonian operator does not depend of the time when it is taken in the box .",
    "moreover , its perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath14 is obtained from the one of @xmath39 .",
    "however , the variational procedure implies that at the order @xmath28 in perturbation , the @xmath46 order contribution which is proportional to @xmath47 has to be expanded in powers of @xmath20 up to order @xmath48 .",
    "this @xmath46 power of @xmath5 does not take into account the @xmath5 present in front of the quartic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "but the two sides of equation ( 14 ) identify themselves in perturbation , mixing that @xmath5 with the perturbative one .",
    ", the zeroth order contribution of @xmath49 is mixed with the first order of @xmath50 . ]",
    "so , we have to know kinetic and potential contributions for each order in the expansion of @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , we will use this equality to compute at any order the value of @xmath52 in term of @xmath49 and @xmath39 .",
    "we decided to compute the mean value of the hamiltonian where its kinetic and potential contributions do not much vary and are the least dependent on the size of the box , @xmath53 in the middle of the box at @xmath54 .      in order to develop a feeling on how the variational method works",
    ", we have to reach high orders of perturbation , @xmath53 calculate a large number of coefficients .",
    "the feynman diagrams approach implies the calculation of an increasing number of graphs .",
    "instead , we prefer a perturbative expansion of the evolution operator closer to the usual rayleigh - ritz method . expanding @xmath41 in powers of the coupling constant @xmath5 , we get the following expansions for @xmath39 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the zero subscripts appended to ket vectors mean that the corresponding expectation values are computed using free propagators with the boundary conditions discussed in section 2 .    in the above expressions ,",
    "we have extracted the @xmath14 dependences of the coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in appendix , a systematic calculation of the @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s is performed with the help of a recursive formula .",
    "the values of the @xmath61 s are deduced from these using ( 14 ) , which gives : @xmath62    after performing the division by @xmath63 order by order in perturbation , the expansion of the mean value of the hamiltonian writes : @xmath64,\\ ] ] where the @xmath65 superscripts of @xmath66 and @xmath67 refer to the contribution of the connected diagrams only .",
    "we have computed these coefficients up to order 16 , and we give here the first few of them : @xmath68",
    "starting from expansion ( 15 ) at order @xmath28 , we perform the replacement @xmath69 . expanding in powers of @xmath20 up to order @xmath48",
    ", we get the required expansion , which then has to be optimized with respect to our variational parameter @xmath21 : @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the values of this expression at its optima in @xmath21 will serve as variational estimates of the value found in @xcite : @xmath71 such a polynomial ( 17 ) has a number of optima which increases with the order of perturbation @xmath28 .",
    "most of them are complex and give a small imaginary part to the estimated value of the energy as in the harmonic approach @xcite .",
    "all of these estimated values exhibit the expected @xmath72 factor .",
    "we take @xmath73 and compute all the optima up to order 16 .",
    "results and comments follow in the next section .",
    "@xmath74 is plotted in figures [ pair ] and [ imp ] versus the variational parameter for several even and odd orders .",
    "since @xmath21 is supposed to be irrelevant at infinite order of perturbation , as expected , as @xmath28 increases , the curves @xmath74 flatten around the exact value over an increasingly large range of values of @xmath21 as @xmath28 increases .",
    "we can follow on these figures the evolution of the optima with the orders of perturbation .",
    "the first minimum to appear provides a rather poor estimate ( @xmath75 ) but moves to the left of the figure as the order increases , and is replaced by a much more accurate maximum ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is clear that a third extremum , a minimum , appears with a still more accurate value @xmath77 , and , from the trend of the odd orders , another , presumably even better maximum would appear if one would push the calculation to a couple more orders .",
    "the polynomial @xmath78 to be optimized has an increasing number of stationary points as the order of perturbation increases . plotting real optima versus",
    "the order of perturbation up to @xmath79 ( figure 3 ) reveals how they arrange themselves : optimal values of @xmath21 belong to families characterized by the straight lines in figure 3 with slopes decreasing proportionally to the inverse of the square root of the order @xmath28 .",
    "such a family is created at first order , followed by another one at fourth order .",
    "one reasonably expects other families to appear at orders greater than @xmath3 , providing some even more accurate values .",
    "figure 4 plots the location in @xmath80 of the all the optima up to order 16 in the first quadrant of the complex plane .",
    "one thus easily follows each family up to order 16 .",
    "such a regular behavior of all these optima is explained in the next subsection by considering the asymptotic expression of @xmath74 for large @xmath28 .",
    "for large @xmath28 , using the stirling formula , we find : @xmath81,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath73 .",
    "so , at large orders , the function to be optimized becomes a series in powers of @xmath82 .",
    "we voluntarily omitted its upper bound in @xmath83 .",
    "using our knowledge of the first coefficients , we establish empirically the following asymptotic behaviors : @xmath84 with these behaviors , the @xmath46 term of the series decreases like @xmath85 and the series has an infinite radius of convergence . for large orders @xmath28 ,",
    "the search for stationary values of @xmath86 in @xmath21 is nothing but the search for those of the series ( 19 ) in @xmath87 .",
    "then , real extremal values of @xmath88 are the slopes of the families on figure 3 . using the optima already calculated",
    ", we can then extrapolate the @xmath21 optima and the corresponding values of the energy for large orders .    the optima of the real family appearing at first order behave asymptotically as : @xmath89 the corresponding value for the energy tends toward a rather bad approximation from above : @xmath90    for the second real family which appears at the fourth order @xmath91 the corresponding energy tends towards a better value from below : @xmath92    the asymptotic value provided by a family is more accurate when the family appears later in perturbation .",
    "we also verify that the slopes tend to decrease .",
    "this corresponds to the successive extrema of ( 22 ) appearing at smaller and smaller values of @xmath88 , corresponding to those of the function @xmath93    @xmath94\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the available coefficients up to order 16 is sufficient to see that this function has a minimum : @xmath95 one recognizes the slope and the asymptotic energy of the first real family within a few percents . using the empirical asymptotic behaviors of the coefficients @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath67 would extend the range of @xmath88 where one could compute @xmath96 , revealing the asymptotic properties of the other families .",
    "the results presented in this paper are qualitatively very similar to those obtained in the harmonic approach @xcite : in the same way as in the harmonic approach , the optima arrange themselves in families which are understood using a large order behavior .",
    "the set of these families provide a sequence of approximate values which converges to the exact one .",
    "however , for a given perturbative order , our estimated values were more accurate in the harmonic approach .",
    "indeed , for the first family , we obtain an estimated value of the ground state energy with a precision of @xmath97 in the harmonic case and of @xmath98 in the present approach.this is presumably due to several causes : in the compact time case , there is no time translation invariance , hence no hamiltonian , and we only compute the expectation value of an operator which becomes the hamiltonian in the large time box limit .",
    "furthermore , as explained in section 2 , our perturbative expansions do not take into account the complete @xmath99 interaction term but only reconstruct it more and more accurately as the perturbative order increases .",
    "finally , a compact euclidean time is clearly quite far from the physics of an anharmonic oscillator , much farther than a harmonic approximation .",
    "one may even consider it quite remarkable that the procedure nevertheless seems to converge in the same manner , albeit much more slowly .",
    "one could thus contemplate using such a compactification , which could involve only the spatial coordinates or both space and time coordinates as a gauge invariant variational approach to gauge theories .",
    "@xmath100    for each time @xmath101 , one uses the closure relation in position space .",
    "the @xmath102 operator is diagonal in this basis .",
    "one thus rewrites the integrand in the following way : @xmath103 @xmath104    for @xmath105 , the free propagator writes : @xmath106 this product of expectation values of operators is a gaussian function in terms of @xmath107.one thus performs integrals over all positions simultaneously to obtain : @xmath108 where @xmath109 @xmath110 is the fourth derivative with respect to @xmath111 .",
    "now , we build a recursive procedure which performs the four derivatives with respect to @xmath111 ( @xmath110 ) together with the integral over @xmath112 $ ] . to do so",
    ", one will use the following identity : @xmath113 with @xmath114 let us define : @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 where:@xmath118 so that @xmath119 satisfies : @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 with the boundary conditions : @xmath123 @xmath124 for the last integration to be performed between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath59 of the perturbative expansion are : @xmath127      @xmath128    the preceding method must now be adapted to a slightly different domain of integration over the times ( now @xmath129 ) .",
    "we will consider four different regions in order to build the recursive definition of a new function @xmath130 ; @xmath131 these four different domains of integration can enter the preceding frame.the quantity @xmath132 counts the remaining iterations to be performed and decreases by one unit at each step .",
    "one then builds the @xmath133 s for each of these steps , writing : @xmath134 sums over @xmath135 and @xmath136 are respectively performed between @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and @xmath137 and @xmath139 .",
