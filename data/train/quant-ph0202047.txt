    "quantum anharmonic oscillators appear in a wide variety of problems in molecular , nuclear or condensed matter physics .",
    "typically , anharmonic terms appear in expansions about a minimum of a potential , when ones tries to incorporate the non - linear features of the forces responsible for this equilibrium .",
    "the most celebrated example is the quartic anharmonic oscillator @xcite where a @xmath3 term is added to the usual harmonic hamiltonian .",
    "introducing bilinear couplings among a set of such oscillators leads to a rich spectrum , for instance , multiphonon bound states in one - dimensional lattice models @xcite . more generally , one can think about the @xmath4 ( or higher powers of @xmath5 ) field theories in various dimensions as systems of coupled anharmonic oscillators .",
    "anharmonic terms can be treated perturbatively and the perturbative series can be represented by feynman diagrams .",
    "unfortunately , the coefficients of the series@xcite have a factorial growth and the numerical values obtained from the truncated series have an accuracy which is subject to limitations . at fixed coupling",
    ", there is an order at which an optimal accuracy is reached . at fixed order",
    ", there is a value of the coupling beyond which the numerical values are meaningless even as an order of magnitude . in the case of the single - well quartic potential , pad approximants can be used for the series or its borel transform .",
    "rigorous proofs of convergence can be established in particular cases @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a method does not apply to the case of the double - well potential@xcite where instanton effects @xcite need to be taken into account .",
    "it should also be noted that even when pad approximants converge , the convergence rate may be slow .",
    "strong coupling expansions @xcite or variational interpolations @xcite sometimes provide more accurate results .",
    "the above discussion shows that finding an expansion which can be used _",
    "indiscriminately _ for most quantum mechanical problems with polynomial potentials remains a challenging problem .",
    "alternatively , one can use numerical methods .",
    "variational methods are often used to obtain upper and lower bounds on energy levels @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on rigorous inequalities and are considered superior to methods based on numerical integration @xcite .",
    "however , the difference between the bounds widens rapidly with the anharmonic coupling and the energy level .",
    "methods based on series expansions in the position variable @xcite appear to produce more significant digits more easily .",
    "however , our understanding of the convergence and numerical stability of these methods seems to be limited to empirical observations .",
    "the methods based on series expansions fall into two categories : methods based on the evaluations of determinants @xcite and methods based on boundary conditions at large but finite values of the position @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this article is to provide a systematic discussion of the errors associated with this second category of methods and to show how to make these errors arbitrarily small in the most efficient way . with the exception of section [ sec : multi ] ,",
    "we only consider one - dimensional problems .",
    "we discuss two types of errors .",
    "first , the numerical errors made in calculating the energy which makes the wave function vanish at some large value of the position @xmath6 .",
    "second , the intrinsic error due to the finiteness of @xmath6 .    the basic elements the numerical method used hereafter were sketched in ref.@xcite and applied to the quartic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we wrote the logarithmic derivative of the wave function which appears in the riccati equation as @xmath7 and showed that these functions were entire .",
    "the values of the first ten eigenvalues with 30 significant digits provided for a particular coupling have been used to test new theoretical methods@xcite .",
    "two issues were left open in this formulation : first , the basic equations had an interesting invariance which was not undestood but could be used to improve the numerical efficiency ; second , the use of the method for parity non - invariant potentials appeared to be unduly complicated @xcite .    in section [ sec : basic ] , we present a new formulation where these two issues are settled .",
    "the basic equations presented depend on an arbitrary _ function _ denoted @xmath8 .",
    "this freedom can be interpreted as a local gauge invariance associated with the fact that only @xmath7 is physical .",
    "the wave function is invariant under these local transformations . in section [ sec : sol ] , we show how to construct power series for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the complications in the case of parity non - invariant potentials ( such as asymmetric double - wells ) are minimal .",
    "when the potential and the gauge function are polynomials , these series define _ entire _ function .",
    "in other words , it is always possible to construct arbitrarily accurate solutions of the schrdinger equation for arbitrary @xmath9 within a given range of the position variable , by calculating enough terms in the expansions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the wave function and determine the energy eigenvalues . in section [ sec",
    ": sens ] , we use the global properties of the flows of the riccati equation to recall of some basic results related to the wkb approximation and the sturm - liouville theorem .",
    "we explain how bifurcations in the asymptotic behavior of the functions @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be exploited to determine the eigenvalues .",
    "it should be noted that the importance of reproducing the proper asymptotic behavior has been emphasized in variational approaches @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that pad approximants have been used in conjunction with the riccati equation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantization condition used was that the approximants give one additional coefficient in the taylor expansion .",
    "this procedure depends only on the coefficients of the expansions used and there is no reference to any particular value of @xmath10 ( as our @xmath6 ) .",
    "consequently , there is no obvious connection between the two approaches .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we show how to turn the gauge invariance to our advantage . in section [ sec : bif ] , the quantitative aspects of the bifurcation are discussed with an exponential parametrization similar to the one used to determine lyapounov exponents in the study of chaotic dynamical system .",
    "the exponents are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "we provide an approximate way to determine the exponents and the energy resolution .",
    "we explain how our freedom in chosing @xmath0 can be used to make the bifurcation more violent and improve the energy resolution .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath0 also affects the convergence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and consequently the numerical accuracy of the solution of the schrdinger equation . in section [ sec : opt ] , we show in a particular example that for an expansion of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at a given order , a judicious choice of gauge can improve tremendously the numerical accuracy of an energy level .",
    "we discuss the two principles which allow to make optimal choices of @xmath0 and provide practical methods to determine approximately this optimal choice for the general case .",
    "we use these methods to explain some empirical results found in @xcite .    in section",
    "[ sec : app ] , we discuss the the error @xmath11 on the energy levels due to the finiteness of @xmath6 .",
    "we propose two approximate formulas valid , respectively , for intermediate and large values of @xmath6 and compatible in overlapping ranges .",
    "note that one can reinterpret the condition that the wavefunction vanishes at @xmath6 as coming from a slightly different problem where the potential becomes infinite at @xmath6 . in the path - integral formulation ( which can be extended immediately to field theory problems ) ,",
    "the fact that the potential becomes infinite at @xmath6 means that paths with values of @xmath10 larger than @xmath6 are not taken into account .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that these configurations are responsible for the asymptotic behavior of the regular perturbative series . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that the perturbative series of several modified problem were convergent .",
    "the error formula sets the accuracy limitations of this approach .",
    "some of the methods used in this section could be used for quantum field theory problems .",
    "the anharmonic oscillator can be considered as a field theory with one time and zero space dimensions .",
    "it can be used to test approximate methods such as perturbative expansions or semi - classical procedures .",
    "an illustrative example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite where multi - instanton effects were considered and where the splitting of the two lowest levels of a double - well problem were estimated with more than hundred digits . in section [ sec :",
    "chall ] , we show that our method can be used to reproduce all these digits .",
    "finally , we discuss the generalization of the method to problems with several variables in section [ sec : multi ] . for these problems , our ability to reduce the degree of expansion by using optimal gauge functions may be crucial .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional , time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath12 , for an hamiltonian @xmath13 as is well - known , one can reexpress the wave function in terms of its logarithmic derivative @xmath14 and obtain the riccati form of the equation : @xmath15 it is assumed that @xmath16 and that the leading power of @xmath17 is even with a positive coefficient ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "writing @xmath19 , we obtain a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ric ] ) provided that we solve the system of equations : @xmath20 where @xmath8 is an unspecified function .",
    "this can be seen by multiplying ( [ eq : basic1 ] ) by @xmath2 , ( [ eq : basic2 ] ) by @xmath1 and eliminating @xmath21 by taking the difference .",
    "one then obtains the riccati equation ( [ eq : ric ] ) multiplied by @xmath22 .",
    "near a zero of @xmath2 , one can check that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic1]-[eq : basic2 ] ) remain valid , namely they impose that @xmath5 has a simple pole with residue @xmath23 .",
    "this allows the wave function to become zero and change sign as the contour goes around the pole on either side .",
    "( [ eq : basic1]-[eq : basic2 ] ) are invariant under the _ local _ transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary function .",
    "it is clear that this transformation leaves @xmath5 and the wave function unchanged . if we choose @xmath26 and eliminate @xmath1 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic2 ] ) , we recover the schrdinger equation for @xmath2 . starting from this gauge and making an arbitrary transformation",
    ", we find that in general @xmath27 this shows that when @xmath0 is polynomial , @xmath2 is simply @xmath28 multiplied by an entire function _ with no zeroes _ @xcite .",
    "this means that the zeroes of @xmath2 and @xmath28 are identical . in other words , there are no spurious zeroes when @xmath0 is polynomial .    by taking the derivative of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : basic2 ] ) and choosing @xmath8 appropriately , one can obtain the basic equations used in @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath8 is reached by comparing the two sets of equations and integrating one of the differences .",
    "the two possibilities are compatible .",
    "the resulting integral expression can be worked out easily by the interested reader .",
    "the only important point is that the @xmath0 found that way is in general not polynomial , justifying the spurious zeroes found with the original formulation .",
    "the function @xmath0 can be chosen at our convenience .",
    "for instance , we could impose the condition @xmath29 by taking @xmath30 and recover the riccati equation for @xmath1 .",
    "however , the main advantage of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic1]-[eq : basic2 ] ) is that they are linear first order differential equations with variables coefficients .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that if we consider these equations for complex @xmath10 , the solutions inherit the domain of analyticity of the coefficients ( provided that this domain is simply connected ) .",
    "if the coefficients are entire functions , there exists a unique entire solution corresponding to a particular set of initial values . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath17 and @xmath0 are polynomials",
    ".    one can construct the unique solution corresponding to a particular choice of initial values @xmath31 and @xmath32 by series expansions . using @xmath33 and similar notations for the other functions ,",
    "one obtains the simple recursion @xmath34 given @xmath35 and @xmath36 , these equations allow to determine all the other coefficients . for potentials which are parity invariant , and if @xmath0 is an odd function , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be assigned definite and opposite parities . in this case , we can impose the initial conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 for even wave functions and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for odd wave functions . if the hamiltonian has no special symmetry , as for instance in the case of an asymmetric double - well , one could leave @xmath35 indeterminate and fix it at the same time as @xmath9 using conditions on the wave function or its derivative at two different points .",
    "these two conditions translate ( in good approximation ) into two polynomial equations in @xmath35 and @xmath9 and can be solved by newton s method .",
    "the fact that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : iter ] ) determines entire functions provided that @xmath17 and @xmath0 are polynomials can be inferred directly from the fact that the coefficients will decrease as @xmath41 for some positive power @xmath42 to be determined and in general depending on the choice of @xmath0 . as we will explain in more detail in section [ sec : sens ] , if the leading term in @xmath17 is @xmath43 , one expects from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ric ] ) that for @xmath10 large enough , @xmath44 and asymptotically , @xmath45 looking at the general expression for @xmath2 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kgen ] ) , one sees that @xmath2 will have the same asymptotic behavior provided that the integral of @xmath0 grows not faster than @xmath46",
    ". if this is the case , then @xmath47 .",
    "this behavior is well observed in empirical series .",
    "note that if @xmath0 grows faster than @xmath48 , the coefficients decay more slowly and the procedure seem to be less efficient . in the following",
    ", we will mostly discuss the case @xmath49 .",
    "if we require that @xmath0 is an odd polynomial growing not faster than @xmath50 , this means that @xmath0 is homogeneous of degree 1 .",
    "in this section , we use the global properties of the flows associated with the riccati equation to rephrase some implications of sturm - liouville theorem and to justify the asymptotic behavior given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aswkb ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this section is to provide a simple and intuitive picture of the bifurcation which occurs when the value of @xmath9 is varied by a small amount above or below an energy eigenvalue .",
    "the main results of this section are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : bif1 ] and [ fig : kas ] .",
    "we consider the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ric ] ) obtained by varying @xmath9 with fixed initial values .",
    "it is convenient to introduce an additional parameter @xmath51 and to rewrite the original equation as a 2-dimensional ode with an @xmath51-independent r.h.s . @xmath52 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "the flows in the @xmath53 plane have some simple global properties that we now proceed to describe .",
    "we consider a solution ( phase curve ) with initial condition @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that for these values the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ode1 ] ) is @xmath57 .",
    "it will become clear later that if such a choice is impossible , a normalizable wave function can not be constructed . with this assumption ,",
    "the phase curve starts moving up and right as @xmath51 increases , possibly going through simple poles with residues @xmath58 .",
    "this situation persists unless the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : ode1 ] ) becomes zero .",
    "we call the separating curves defined by a zero for the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ode1 ] ) , @xmath59 , `` @xmath60 curves '' .",
    "after a phase curve crosses ( horizontally ) a @xmath60 curve , it moves right and down .",
    "if it crosses the @xmath60 curve again , we can repeat the discussion as at the beginning .    at some point",
    ", we reach the `` last '' @xmath60 curve ( i.e. , the farthest right ) . for @xmath10 large enough , the potential is dominated by its largest power and the upper ( lower ) part of this last wkb curve has a strictly positive ( negative ) slope . for such values of @xmath10 ,",
    "if a phase curve crosses the wkb curve , it will do so horizontally and move _ inside _ the region where the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : ode1 ] ) is negative .",
    "as @xmath51 further increases , @xmath5 decreases , but the phase curve can not cross horizontally the lower part of the wkb curve which has a strictly negative slope . in the same region ,",
    "if @xmath5 has a pole , the curve reappears below the lower part of the wkb curve and will never take positive values again .    in summary ,",
    "if in the region described above , a phase curve crosses the wkb curve or develops a pole , then it can not develop a pole again .",
    "the other logical possibility is that the phase curve does none of the above .",
    "it is thus clear that for fixed @xmath9 , we can always find a @xmath61 such that if @xmath62 , @xmath63 has no pole .",
    "consequently the two terms involving @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ric ] ) can not grow faster than @xmath64 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath64 would become negligible and a pole would be necessary .",
    "at least one of these two terms needs to match @xmath64 .",
    "inspection of the two possibilities leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : aswkb ] ) .",
    "only the positive solution which follows asymptotically the upper wkb curve leads to a normalizable wave function .    if we compare two phase curves with identical initial conditions but different @xmath9 , the one with larger @xmath9 initially lays above the other one .",
    "if the one with lower @xmath9 has a first pole at @xmath65 , then the one with larger @xmath9 has a first pole at some @xmath66 . remembering that the poles of @xmath5 produce zeroes of @xmath28 , this rephrases the main idea behind the sturm - liouville theorem .",
    "an exact energy eigenstate @xmath67 is obtained when the wave function has its last zero at infinity . when @xmath9 is fine - tuned to that value , @xmath5 follows closely the upper branch of the wkb curve .",
    "this trajectory in unstable under small changes in @xmath9 .",
    "if the energy is slightly increased with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath5 develops a pole and reappears on the lower part of the wkb curve .",
    "if the energy is slightly decreased with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath5 crosses the upper part of the wkb curve and reaches the lower part of the wkb curve .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif1 ] in the case of the ground state of the quartic single - well anharmonic oscillator with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "all the figures in this section and the next two sections have been done with this particular example .",
    "the sensitive dependence on @xmath9 is also present in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "if the energy is slightly increased with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath2 reaches zero at a finite value of @xmath10 .",
    "if the energy is slightly decreased with respect to @xmath67 , @xmath2 increases rapidly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kas ] for the same example as in fig .",

    "this can be implemented in good approximation by requiring that the wave function has also a zero at some large negative value @xmath75 . for potentials with a reflection symmetry about another point @xmath65 than the origin , one can impose that the wave function ( @xmath76 ) or its derivative ( @xmath77 ) vanish at that point . in all cases , we have an independent condition which allows to determine @xmath70 .    in summary , for @xmath6",
    "large enough , the condition @xmath78 provides sharp upper bound on the energy levels .",
    "the lower part of fig . [ fig : kas ] makes clear that as @xmath6 increases , sharper bounds are reached . for potentials that are not parity invariant",
    ", an additional condition has to be imposed . in all cases ,",
    "one obtains polynomial equations which can be solved for the energy levels given the potential or vice - versa using newton s method .",
    "note also that a sharp lower bound can be found by solving @xmath79 .",
    "the fact that in fig .",
    "[ fig : kas ] , a zero of @xmath2 at @xmath80 corresponds to a zero of @xmath1 at @xmath81 , suggests that the exact value should be very close to the average of the two bounds .",
    "the strength of the bifurcation in @xmath2 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kas ] can be approximately characterized by local exponents .",

    "this situation is approximately realized in the example considered before as shown in fig .",

    "a detailed construction shows that if @xmath170 has no special symmetry , we can determine all the coefficient up to a given order @xmath171 provided that we supply the values of two coefficients at each intermediate order ( for instance @xmath172 for @xmath173 ) .",

    "a practical implementation of this program is in progress .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that accurate estimates of the energy levels of arbitrary polynomial potentials bounded from below can be obtained by solving polynomial equations . the fact that the function @xmath1 and @xmath2 are entire guarantees that if we calculate enough terms we will gain proper control of the asymptotic behavior of the wave function . reaching this goal is in general a difficult task which often requires guesswork and analytical continuations ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", the convergence of the procedure is guaranteed and the order at which we can terminate the expansion in order to reach a given accuracy can be estimated .",
    "in addition , a systematic understanding and control of the errors due to the finite value of @xmath6 has been achieved .",
    "the understanding of the gauge invariance of the basic equations proposed here completely resolves the issues raised from our initial proposal @xcite . by varying @xmath0 , from 0 to -@xmath5 , we can interpolate between a situation where @xmath2 is the wave function to another situation where @xmath29 and @xmath177",
    ". however , for every other choice of @xmath0 , only the ratio @xmath7 has a direct physical meaning . by properly chosing @xmath0",
    ", we can at the same time improve the convergence of @xmath2 and amplify the bifurcation toward the the non - normalizable behavior .",
    "the extreme accuracy obtained for two widely separated wells indicates that for reasonably complicated potential , the number of terms that needs to be calculated is not prohibitive .",
    "we intend to use this method to test analytical results regarding the role of large configurations in the path - integral and to test semi - classical treatment of potentials with asymmetric wells @xcite .",
    "the method can be extended in the case of several variables .",
    "it remains to be determined if the simultaneous solution of many polynomial equations can be accomplished with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "for these problems , the fact that a judicious choice of the arbitrary functions @xmath178 allows to decrease the order of the expansions may be crucial .",
