    "the accurate determination of chemical abundances of planetary nebulae ( pne ) is of fundamental importance to the understanding of the nucleosynthesis of low- and intermediate - mass stars and the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , one of the main problems in nebular astrophysics is that the heavy element abundances derived from collisionally excited lines ( cel ) are often lower than those derived from optical recombination lines ( orls ) . the typical orl / cel abundance discrepancy factor ( adf )",
    "is @xmath2 for general pne .",
    "the most extreme case to date is hf 2 - 2 , which has a adf of about 70 @xcite .",
    "recent reviews on this problem have been presented by @xcite and @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "there are two possible solutions : ( 1 ) the presence of temperature and density variations in chemically homogeneous nebulae ; ( 2 ) the two - component nebular model with hydrogen - deficient inclusions embedded in the diffuse nebula . in order to test the two scenarios , we need to further investigate nebular physical conditions ,",
    "in particular for the regions that orls originate in . for this purpose , new plasma diagnostic tools rather than the classical cel diagnostics are badly required .",
    "@xcite applied the hydrogen balmer jump to determine the electron temperatures ",
    "hereafter @xmath0(h  i )  for a large sample of pne .",
    "they found that @xmath0(h  i ) is systematically lower than that derived from the ratio of nebular to auroral lines of [ o  iii ]  hereafter @xmath0(o",
    "iii ) , consistent with previous results by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between @xmath0(h  i ) and @xmath0(o  iii ) were first studied by @xcite , who found that temperature variations within nebulae may lead to higher @xmath0(o  iii ) compared to @xmath0(h  i ) . to quantitatively study the problem , they defined the mean square temperature variation , @xmath3 .",
    "photoionization models of chemically and spatially homogeneous nebulae yielded typical values of @xmath3 between 0.0030.015 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the observations by @xcite and @xcite indicated to considerably large temperature variations , which are far beyond the predictions of typical photoionization models .",
    "this can be ascribed to either additional energy inputs for chemically homogeneous nebulae or chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "@xcite developed a method to use the he  i recombination line ratios to diagnose electron temperatures ",
    "hereafter @xmath0(he  i ) .",
    "the comparison between @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) is essential to discriminate between the two - abundance model and chemically homogeneous nebulae with temperature and density variations as responsible for the cel / orl abundance problem since the two scenarios predict different relations between @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) . from a study of a sample of 48 pne ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) found that @xmath0(he  i ) is significantly lower than @xmath0(h  i ) , in favor of the two - abundance model .",
    "however , there are two arguable problems .",
    "@xcite found that for some pne the @xmath0(he  i ) values derived from the he  i @xmath43889 , 4471 , and 7069 are different with those derived from the he  i @xmath46678,7281 .",
    "this might be partially caused by the uncertainties of the density of he@xmath5 zones and/or the optical depth effects on the he  i @xmath63889 .",
    "@xcite proposed that at least 10 different he  i lines are required to accurately deduce these parameters .",
    "moreover , for high - excitation pne the he@xmath5 and h@xmath5 zones are not identical , and the presence of a substantial he@xmath1 zone may partially contribute to the difference between @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "these methods have also been used to determine the electron temperatures of h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the temperature differences in h  ii regions are not so obvious as those found in pne .    in this paper , we use an alternative method , fitting the he  i discontinuities , to determine @xmath0(he  i ) for five galactic pne .",
    "this method is made possible by the availability of high signal - to - noise spectra of these nebulae resulting in a clear detection of the helium jump .",
    "the current study allows us to further investigate the relation between @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "we examine the two - abundance models and photoionization models of chemically homogeneous nebulae as the explanation of the observed @xmath0(h  i)/ @xmath0(he  i ) discrepancies .",
    "this paper is a complement to the authors work on recombination spectra as probes of physical conditions of pne @xcite .",
    "the sample includes two low - excitation pne and three high - excitation pne ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the long - slit spectra were obtained using the f-18 nasmyth focus of the 2.3 m advanced technology telescope at siding spring observatory on march 2000 .",
    "both arms of the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) were used with the 1200b grating in the second order to give spectral resolution of 0.3 / pixel . the dichroic may be removed or replaced with a flat mirror allowing the use of either arm independently .",
    "the detector was a site @xmath7 chip , giving a spectral coverage from 32408520 . in order to avoid loss of light due to atmospheric refraction",
    "each pn was observed with the spectrograph slit aligned to the parallactic angle .",
    "furthermore , all the observations were carried out under the best seeing conditions , along with airmass around 1.2 to ensure the total uv light into the spectrograph slit .",
    "for each pn , the exposure time was 1500s .",
    "the long92 package in midas was used for the data reduction following the standard steps , including bias subtraction , flat - field correction , cosmic - ray rejection , and wavelength calibration with a helium - argon calibration lamp .",
    "flux calibration was conducted using the spectroscopic standards eg131 and ltt4364 .",
    "finally , the spectra were dereddened using the standard galactic extinction law for a total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath8 @xcite and the extinction coefficients given by @xcite .",
    "the spectra allow us to simultaneously determinate @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) in terms of the he  i discontinuities at 3421 ( @xmath9 ) , produced by he@xmath10 recombination to the he  i 2p@xmath11p@xmath12 level , and the h  i balmer discontinuities at 3646 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "note that we do not distinguish between the electron temperatures derived from the he  i discontinuities and from the he  i lines and use @xmath0(he  i ) to denote both of them .",
    "the method is similar to that used to obtain @xmath0(h  i ) in @xcite . to synthesize the spectra",
    ", we consider the contributions from the free - free , free - bound , and bound - bound emission from h  i , he  i , and he  ii and the two - photon decay from the 2@xmath14 level of hydrogen .",
    "the coefficients of the h  i , he  i , and he  ii continuous emission as functions of temperature are available in @xcite .",
    "the scattering from the central star is simulated using a modified black - body function , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spectral index ( @xmath17 for stardand black - body spectrum ) , @xmath18 is the planck function , and @xmath19 is the temperature of the central star .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of our fitting procedure . in order to illustrate our method , fig .  [ theory ]",
    "gives the theoretical spectra at different @xmath0(he  i ) .",
    "it is clear that increasing of @xmath0(he  i ) will decrease the he  i discontinuities .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the number of the lowest - energy free electrons , which is proportional to the intensity of the he  i free - bound emission at 3421@xmath20 , decreases with increasing electron temperature . for the same reason , the h  i balmer discontinuities decrease with increasing @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "note that the @xmath21 values may slightly change with @xmath0(he  i ) because of a small contribution from the he  i discontinuity at 3680 produced by recombination to the 2@xmath22p level .",
    "consequently , @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) can be derived by fitting the theoretical to the observed spectra . before the fitting",
    ", we require to measure the he@xmath5/h@xmath5 and he@xmath1/he@xmath5 abundance ratios .",
    "the he@xmath5/h@xmath5 ratios are obtained from a few strong he  i lines around the he  i discontinuities .",
    "the deduced he@xmath5/h@xmath5 ratios are relatively insensitive to the adopted electron temperatures and densities .",
    "the flux uncertainties of the he  i lines are less than 15@xmath23 .",
    "the he@xmath1/he@xmath5 ratios are taken from @xcite ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the errors in temperature determination caused by uncertainties of the he@xmath1/he@xmath5 ratios are negligible since the contribution from he  ii to the continuum emission is much smaller than that from h  i and he  i.    figure .",
    "[ spe ] shows the fitting results for the five pne . in order to reduce the errors caused by uncertainties in the reddening correction and flux calibration",
    ", we have normalized all the spectra to h  11 @xmath24 .",
    "the resultant @xmath0(he  i ) and @xmath0(h  i ) are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "given the relations @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , the errors introduced by measurement uncertainties can be estimated through @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rms noise derived from the spectral regions free of emission lines , which cover a wide wavelength range .",
    "we found that for all the nebulae the 3@xmath28 values are well below the @xmath29 values .",
    "another error source arises in the uncertainties of the he  i line emission coefficients , which might introduce an error in the he  i temperature determination of about @xmath30 according to a comparison of the atomic data given by different authors @xcite . for high - excitation pne ,",
    "additional errors are caused by the strong o  iii bowen lines around the he  i discontinuities .",
    "in such cases , our fittings were based on the spectral regions with wavelengths departing from 3421 , introducing a @xmath31 errors in derived @xmath0(he  i ) caused by uncertainties in flux calibration .",
    "the emission efficient of hydrogen two - photon continuity was deduced under case a assumption and might be significantly underestimated under case b conditions due to the collisional excitation from 2@xmath32 to 2@xmath14 .",
    "however , the excess emission of two - photon process can be mostly compensated by the simulated scattering continuities , and we do not require accurate estimate of the absolution magnitude of two - photo emission .",
    "the uncertainties in the smooth continuities hardly affect our results mainly based on the 3421 discontinuity .",
    "the right panels of figure .",
    "[ spe ] give zoom - in views of the spectra around the he  i discontinuities . for some pne",
    ", the narrow spectral ranges from 34213500 can not be well fitted by our models due to the facts that the models did not treat the extended wings of o  iii bowen lines and the blended high-@xmath33 he  i lines at the red side of the 3421 discontinuity , and the low sensitivity near the ccd edges leads to a larger slope .",
    "nevertheless , these effects on our results should be somewhat insignificant since the deviations exist only in a relatively limited wavelength range .",
    "of course , if our models merely take into account the spectra from 33003600 , we can achieve a better fitting in such a narrow wavelength range by adjusting the contribution from scattering continuities .",
    "however , this will result in a failed fitting of the global spectra . modelling different spectral ranges to a reasonably good extent , we have assessed the errors in @xmath0(he  i ) . in figure .",
    "[ spe ] , we overlaid the best fitting to the narrow spectral ranges ( 33003600 ) of ngc2440 , ngc3242 , and ngc3918 , which results in @xmath0(he  i)@xmath34k , 7500k , and 8250k for the three high - excitation pne , respectively . we noted that these values , which should be larger than the real @xmath0(he  i ) values , are still lower than @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "three of the pne in the recent sample have been studied in paper  i. for comparison , table  [ tab1 ] gives @xmath0(h  i ) and @xmath0(he  i ) determined in paper  i. considering the error bars , they are in agreement with the results derived in the recent work .",
    "note that the @xmath0(he  i ) in paper  i were derived from he  i lines ratios and might possibly be different with those from he  i discontinuities due to the effects of radiative transfer and temperature inhomogeneities .    in fig .",

    "[ com ] shows that @xmath0(he  i ) is consistently lower than @xmath0(h  i ) , confirming our previous results in paper  i. in the scenario of the two - abundance model , the he  i emission are significantly contaminated by emission from the extremely cold hydrogen - deficient inclusions while the h  i recombination spectra dominantly originate in the normal component under a typical temperature of @xmath35  k. this provides a plausible explanation for the lower @xmath0(he  i ) compared to @xmath0(h  i ) . in fig .",
    "[ com ] , we also overplot the results for h  ii regions obtained by @xcite , which are located at a more compact area in this figure and indicate to a smaller @xmath0(he  i)/@xmath0(h  i ) discrepancy in h  ii regions compared to pne .",
    "a few strong he  i lines have been clearly detected in the red arm .",
    "they allow an independent examination of our results derived from the he  i discontinuities .",
    "this is non trivial in that density inhomogeneities and radiative transfer effects could affect our results to some extent .",

    "these line ratios have only weak dependence on electron densities and are hardly used to determined @xmath40(he  i ) .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] gives the @xmath0(he  i ) values derived from the he  i line observations .",
    "the uncertainties of electron densities and optical opacities introduce an error of about 1500k . using the spectral lines falling in the overlapping wavelength region of two adjacent orders",
    ", we estimated the uncertainties in flux calibration to be about 5@xmath23 .",
    "the combined errors of the resultant @xmath0(he  i ) amounts to about 2200k .",
    "the @xmath0(he  i ) deduced in this paper are biased to larger values compared to those in paper  i ( although they are marginally consistent with each other considering the error bars ) .",
    "this is partly attributed to the fact that in the present observation the slit was put in a position closer to the center .",
    "however , the primary cause might be that the uncertainties in flux calibration of the red arm are probably larger than expect .",
    "we performed a comparison of the present spectra and our previous long - slit spectra and found that the former have systematical higher line fluxes in very red wavelength regions .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the fluxes of the he  i @xmath42 might have been significantly overestimated , and the @xmath0(he  i ) in table  [ tab2 ] should be treated as upper limits , which are still lower than @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of he  i lines requires more precise observations in the red arm and is beyond the focus of the present paper .",
    "one should bear in mind that the electron temperatures derived from the he  i discontinuities and those from the he  i line ratios are not necessary identical since they have different temperature dependences , and thus weight different regions if large temperature fluctuations exist .",
    "the comparison of he  i discontinuity- and line - temperatures is a potentially intriguing subject for future research .      an issue is invited , whether the large @xmath0(h  i)/ @xmath0(he  i ) discrepancies in high - excitation pne can be ascribed to the presence of substantial he@xmath1 zone which has a higher temperature than he@xmath10 zone . in order to investigate the problem , we first compare the observed results with the predictions by 1d photoionization models of chemically homogeneous nebulae .",

    "<S> a series of photoionization models were constructed to test the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the observed @xmath0(he  i)/@xmath0(h  i ) discrepancies are beyond the predictions of chemically homogeneous models . </S>",
    "<S> our modelling shows that the presence of a small amount of hydrogen - deficient inclusions seems to be able to reproduce the observed intensities of he  i discontinuities . </S>",
