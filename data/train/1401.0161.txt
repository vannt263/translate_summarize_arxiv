    "neutron stars have been serving as laboratories to probe the densest and most neutron - rich matter in the universe .",
    "it is generally believed that the outer , low - density part of a neutron star ( crust ) consists of a body - center - cubic lattice of neutron - rich nuclei , embedded in a gas of electrons and , if any , dripped neutrons , and near normal nuclear density ( @xmath1 ) , the nuclei melt into uniform nucleonic matter , which mainly composes the star s core @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of matter in the star , i.e. , neutron star matter , has one - to - one correspondence to the star s mass ( @xmath2 ) and radius ( @xmath3 ) relation via hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "observational data for @xmath2 have been accumulated @xcite , whereas those for @xmath3 have been recently estimated from observations of thermonuclear x - ray bursts with photospheric radius expansion and thermal spectra from quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .    in theoretically describing laboratory nuclei and neutron star matter",
    ", it is useful to consider the energy of `` nuclear matter , '' i.e. , hypothetical infinite matter , composed of neutrons and of protons that have electric charge switched off . for simplicity , as neutron star matter",
    ", we will consider zero - temperature , @xmath4 equilibrated , charge neutral matter made of real nucleons and electrons .",
    "the eos of nuclear matter is still uncertain even near @xmath1 , while it can be constrained from terrestrial nuclear experiments @xcite and neutron star observations @xcite via theoretical calculations .",
    "it is noteworthy that the candidates for low - mass neutron stars have been discovered in binary systems @xcite , which could give additional information on the eos once @xmath3 is measured .",
    "the energy of uniform nuclear matter can be expanded around the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , i.e. , nuclear matter made of the same number of neutrons and protons , with respect to the nucleon number density , @xmath5 , and neutron excess , @xmath6 , defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the neutron and proton number densities . in practice , in the vicinity of the saturation point of snm at zero temperature , the energy per nucleon , @xmath10 , of uniform nuclear matter can be written as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath11\\alpha^2 , \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the saturation energy , the saturation density , and the incompressibility of snm , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are associated with the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "that is , @xmath18 is the symmetry energy coefficient at @xmath19 , while @xmath16 characterizes the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around @xmath19 , defined as @xmath20 . among these five parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 can be relatively easier to determine from empirical data for masses and radii of stable nuclei , while the remaining two parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath16 , are more difficult to fix @xcite .",
    "this is why we focus on the various sets of @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( table [ tab : eos ] ) in analyzing neutron star matter .",
    ".nuclear matter eos parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these two parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath16 , mainly determine the stiffness of neutron - rich nuclear matter , but have yet to be fixed . it is also suggested that @xmath14 is related to the giant resonances of stable nuclei @xcite , while @xmath16 is associated with the structure and reactions of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite and the pressure of pure neutron matter at the saturation density of snm . additionally , one could constrain @xmath16 via quasi - periodic oscillations in giant flares observed from soft - gamma repeaters @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the well - known empirical nuclear mass and radius formulas @xcite , the neutron star counterparts have to be theoretically given as function of not only the central density ( @xmath21 ) , but such eos parameters as @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "so far , however , the dependence of low - mass neutron star models on @xmath14 and @xmath16 remains to be examined systematically .",
    "we thus start with construction of the neutron star models from various eoss of neutron star matter that meet the following conditions :    1 .   unified description of matter in the crust and core based on the same eos of nuclear matter with specific values of @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "consistency of the masses and radii of stable nuclei calculated within the same theoretical framework with the empirical values .",
    "mass and radius formulas for low - mass neutron stars are finally obtained in such a way as to approximately reproduce the neutron star models thus constructed .",
    "among many available eoss of neutron star matter , we adopt the eoss that meet the above conditions , i.e. , unified eoss , which are categorized into three groups as in table [ tab : eos ] .",
    "the first is based on the phenomenological eos of uniform nuclear matter that was constructed by two of us @xcite , using a simplified version of the extended thomas - fermi theory @xcite , in such a way as to reproduce empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei .",
    "they adopted the pad - type potential energies with respect to the nucleon density @xmath5 for snm and for neutron matter , respectively , and connected them in a quadratic approximation with respect to neutron excess @xmath6 .",
    "this form of the potential energy can well reproduce the variational calculations of @xcite , to which , in fact , the high - density behavior of neutron matter was adjusted .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the potential energy is partially justified by the variational calculations of @xcite , and the expression for the total energy reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) in the limit of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . with such eoss of uniform nuclear matter obtained for various sets of ( @xmath14 , @xmath16 )",
    ", they constructed the eoss of neutron star matter @xcite by generalizing the above thomas - fermi theory as done by @xcite .",
    "hereafter , such eoss of neutron star matter are referred to as the oi - eoss .",
    "we remark that generally accepted values of @xmath14 lie in the range of @xmath24 mev @xcite or so , while the oi - eoss include rather extreme cases of @xmath25 and 360 mev , as shown in table [ tab : eos ] , to cover the large parameter space .",
    "the final mass and radius formulas would remain almost unchanged even if the oi - eoss with @xmath25 and 360 mev are not included in the fitting .    in the second group ,",
    "there are two eoss of neutron star matter calculated within the relativistic framework .",
    "one is the shen eos based on the relativistic mean field theory with the tm1 nuclear interaction @xcite , and the other is the miyatsu eos based on the relativistic hartree - fock theory with the chiral quark - meson coupling model @xcite . in both eoss",
    ", the same type of the thomas - fermi model as used for the oi - eoss is used in describing neutron star matter in such a way as to reproduce empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei .    the third group is composed of the five eoss of neutron star matter based on the skyrme - type effective interactions : fps @xcite , sly4 @xcite , bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 @xcite . the fps interaction , which was constructed by fitting the properties of uniform nucleon matter calculated by @xcite , well reproduces the empirical ground - state properties of doubly magic stable nuclei via the hartree - fock calculations .",
    "the sly4 interaction was constructed by @xcite in such a way as to reproduce the microscopic eos of neutron matter calculated with the uv14+uvii nuclear force by @xcite as well as the empirical ground - state properties of doubly magic stable nuclei within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 interactions are written in the form of the nuclear energy - density functionals , which are derived from generalized skyrme interactions in such a way as to fit all the available nuclear mass data @xcite . as a result , empirical charge radii were also well reproduced .",
    "these interactions are different in the sense that bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 are fitted to the eoss of neutron matter derived by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this difference is expected to play a role in estimating the effect of uncertainties in three - neutron interactions on the stellar properties , as we shall see . in describing neutron star matter ,",
    "a compressible liquid - drop approach was used for fps and sly4 , while an extended thomas - fermi model was used for bsk19 , bsk20 and bsk21 . to calculate the neutron star models in the present study",
    ", we adopt the analytical expressions for fps and sly4 given by @xcite and for bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 given by @xcite .    .",
    "we plot the relations between the mass and radius ( a ) and between the gravitational redshift and radiation radius ( b ) .",
    "the mark and end on each line denote the stellar models with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . in ( a )",
    ", the labels on the lines denote the values of the nuclear matter parameter @xmath28 .",
    "to distinguish between the oi - eoss , we add the values of @xmath14 to the oi - eos labels ; for example , we use  oi 180 \" for the two oi - eoss with @xmath29 mev ( left , smaller @xmath16 ; right , larger @xmath16 )",

    "now , we construct nonrotating neutron stars by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations from the stellar center of density @xmath21 outward up to the position where the pressure vanishes .",
    "it is not clear up to what density the adopted unified eoss are applicable .",
    "nonetheless , one can expect that non - nucleonic components such as hyperons and quarks do not occur below @xmath31 @xcite and that the uncertainty from three - neutron interactions in the eos of pure neutron matter becomes relevant above @xmath31 , as suggested by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite .",
    "we thus examine the stellar models for @xmath32 , where @xmath1 is set to @xmath33 g @xmath34 , and the resultant @xmath2-@xmath3 relations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr](a ) .    to systematically describe various stellar models ,",

    "the values of @xmath28 are shown in table [ tab : eos ] .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation changes almost smoothly with @xmath28 .",
    "note that the oi - eoss @xcite with @xmath36 mev are too soft to keep the pressure positive and thus not used here .",
    "this implies the lower limit of @xmath28 of order 30 mev .",
    "meanwhile , the eos models used here cover the values of @xmath28 up to @xmath37 mev , which is significantly larger than expected from existing nuclear experiments .",
    "we remark that the powers of @xmath16 and @xmath14 in @xmath28 are chosen to be simple rational numbers in such a way that @xmath28 has the same unit as @xmath16 and @xmath14 , i.e. , mev . if one considers arbitrary real numbers as the exponents , therefore , one could choose different kinds of @xmath28 with which the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation changes as smoothly as the present choice .    from the observational viewpoint , the radiation radius @xmath38 and the gravitational redshift @xmath39 with the gravitational constant @xmath40 and the speed of light @xmath41 could be more relevant in describing the stellar properties than @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated @xmath42-@xmath43 relation again shows a smooth change with @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr](b ) ) . the photon flux ,",
    "if detected , would be proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the distance from the earth , while the gravitational redshift could be determined from the possible shift of atomic absorption lines in spectra of the stars .",
    "the smooth change of the stellar properties with @xmath28 suggests that not only future nuclear experiments but also simultaneous measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 or , equivalently , @xmath42 and @xmath43 could constrain @xmath28 , which could in turn lead to restriction of the stellar models .",
    "in particular , observations of low - mass neutron stars would be essential .",
    "for example , the radiation radius of the x - ray source , cxou 132619.7472910.8 , in the globular cluster ngc 5139 ( @xmath30 cen ) has been determined as @xmath46 km from the @xmath47 data @xcite .",
    "the allowed region from this @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr](a ) and ( b ) with the shaded region .",
    "this is still consistent with various values of @xmath28 , but future precise determination of @xmath43 could constrain @xmath28 , if @xmath2 is low enough .",
    "additionally , thermal spectra detected from quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries are expected to give @xmath2 and @xmath3 simultaneously @xcite .    .",
    "the stellar models constructed from various unified eoss are given for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the solid , broken , and dotted lines are the linear fitting to the cases of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively ( see text for details).,width=377 ]",
    "to examine the dependence of the stellar properties on @xmath28 more clearly , we plot the stellar masses calculated for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etam](a ) ) . from this figure",
    ", we find that the stellar masses for fixed @xmath21 can be approximately expressed as a linear function of @xmath28 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are adjustable parameters that depend on @xmath21 .",
    "the validity of @xmath28 is now evident .",
    "the deviation of the calculations from the linear fit at @xmath48 is larger than that at @xmath54 , particularly for bsk20 and bsk21 .",
    "such deviation is of the order of uncertainties in @xmath2 due to three - neutron interactions obtained from the qmc evaluations @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 can then be expressed as a quadratic function of @xmath55 within the accuracy of errors less than a few percent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c0c1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the mass formula : @xmath56 where we confine ourselves to @xmath57 ; otherwise , the stellar models can become unstable with respect to decompression , depending on the eos of neutron star matter .     and @xmath53 in the mass formula .",
    "the corresponding quadratic fitting curves ( solid and broken lines ) are also shown as a function of @xmath58 . here",
    "we consider the stellar models only for @xmath59 to avoid unstable neutron star models.,width=377 ]    we also find that the gravitational redshift calculated for fixed @xmath21 can be approximately expressed as a linear function of @xmath28 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : etam](b ) ) .",
    "then , just like the mass formula ( [ eq : mass ] ) , we can obtain the theoretical formula for @xmath42 as @xmath60 using eqs .",

    "we confirm a good agreement between those two except for @xmath66 mev .",
    "the mass and radius formulas could help to constrain not only the nuclear matter parameter @xmath28 but also a star s @xmath21 via possible simultaneous measurements of the star s @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if such measurements are precise , @xmath28 could be deduced to within the accuracy of @xmath67 mev , which would provide a basis for analyzing more massive neutron stars .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : etar ] , one can also observe that the calculated @xmath3 depends nonlinearly on @xmath21 at small values of @xmath28 , while converging on an approximately linear function of @xmath28 at sufficiently large values of @xmath28 : @xmath68 note that such nonlinear dependence at small values of @xmath28 arises from the flattened behavior of the corresponding @xmath2-@xmath3 relations that can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mr](a ) , while such convergence at large values of @xmath28 is related to the vertically straightened behavior of the corresponding @xmath2-@xmath3 relations .",
    "in this paper , we have succeeded in constructing the theoretical formulas for the masses , gravitational redshifts , and radii of low - mass neutron stars as functions of the star s central density and the new eos parameter @xmath28 in a manner that is consistent with empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei .",
    "the value of @xmath28 , which characterizes the stiffness of neutron star matter , remains unknown , but could be deduced from possible simultaneous @xmath2 and @xmath3 measurements via comparison with our formulas if the star observed is light enough .",
    "thus , a firm evidence for the presence of low - mass neutron stars is first of all desired .",
    "one promising candidate is the neutron star in the high - mass x - ray binary 4u 1538 - 52 , of which the mass could be significantly low or even the lowest among stars with known mass if the binary orbit is eccentric @xcite .",
    "the x - ray burster 4u 1724 - 307 in the globular cluster terzan 2 is even more interesting because the x - ray data from the cooling phase of photospheric radius expansion bursts apparently allow the object to have a relatively low mass and still a significantly large radius @xcite .",
    "such conclusions are tentative partly because of the dependence on the atmosphere models adopted and partly because of uncertainties in the distance to the object , but , if valid , might eventually suggest the @xmath28 value of order or even larger than 130 mev .",
