    "similar systems of majorana nanowire coupled to quantum dots ( qds ) have been investigated for phenomena such as teleportation @xcite , anomaly of conductance peak @xcite , characteristic signatures in current noise spectrum @xcite , and featured josephson current @xcite .",
    "our present interest is the dc josephson current under the influence of spin - selective coupling between the majorana and qd states , which is most relevant to _ bent junctions _ and the presence of magnetic field in the qd area .    due to the helical property of mf , the mf at the end of the nanowire only couples to a unique spin state in the normal region , e.g. , the spin - up qd state as shown in fig .  [ system ]",
    ". actually , this spin - selective coupling is the origin of the spin - dependent andreev reflection @xcite . in previous studies ,",
    "the set - up configuration is usually assumed to be either a single majorana nanowire coupled to normal leads or qds , or a straight majorana  normal region  majorana junction with bent angle @xmath3 . in both cases , only the spin - up states ( in the normal parts )",
    "couple to the mf and contribute to the current .",
    "however , if the majorana  qd  majorana junction is not straight ( with a bent angle @xmath4 between the nanowires ) , the two mfs at the ends of the nanowires ( see fig .  [ system ] ) will couple to spin states in the qd with different orientations , leading thus to both the spin - up and spin - down states participating in the transport .",
    "this is anticipated to result in different current behaviors of the straight and bent junctions .",
    "on the application aspect ( e.g. in the topological quantum computations ) , the majorana nanowires will possibly have an orientational angle , or one would like to employ this orientational angle to modulate the charge transfer properties .",
    "this makes thus the bending structure studied in this work relevant to possible real circuits .",
    "we will also analyze the effect of magnetic fields in the qd area .",
    "this is motivated by viewing that , in order to induce the emergence of mf , magnetic fields are needed to apply in the nanowires , which must spill over in the qd area owing to its close separations from the nanowires .",
    "similar to the consequence of junction bending , we expect that the non-@xmath5-axial direction magnetic field will make the spin - down state involved in the transport as well .",
    "we will show that , remarkably , owing to the spin - selective coupling , both the magnetic field in the qd area and the junction bending will result in some counterintuitive behaviors of the josephson current .",
    "for instance , in the case of qd level aligned with the fermi energy ( under resonant tunneling ) , the josephson current is to be strongly suppressed by the magnetic field and junction bending .",

[ system ] by @xmath6 for the left wire and @xmath7 for the right one .",
    "the tunnel - coupled system can be modeled by an effective low - energy hamiltonian @xmath8 , more explicitly with    @xmath9    [ ham ]    here @xmath10 is the effective low energy hamiltonian for the two pairs of majorana states emerged at the ends of the two nanowires .",

    "another important issue to be noted is that , due to the helical property of mf , the mf only couples to the spin - up state in the qd ( defined in the same @xmath5-representation of the associated nanowire ) @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", our special interest in this work is to consider the two nanowires not aligned in the same orientation , but with an angle @xmath24 , as shown in fig.[system ] .",

    "+   +      we now consider the possible effects of magnetic field in the dot area .",
    "for the zeeman splitting of the dot level caused by the magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis , we can understand that the effect is the same as the electric gate - modulation of the dot level , as shown in fig .",

    "the jump at @xmath57 disappears and evolves to a rounded transition behavior . and , with the increase of @xmath65 , the josephson current quickly decreases and vanishes at last .",
    "for @xmath67 , similar modulation effect of @xmath65 on the amplitude of the josephson current is caused by the spin - selective coupling between the majorana and qd states , by noting that the magnetic field @xmath65 has a role of rotating the electron spin , leading thus to a change of the @xmath5-component of the spin .",
    "however , in this more  relaxed \" case ( @xmath67 ) , the jump behavior at @xmath57 survives .",
    "this indicates that the majorana characteristic _ jump _ behavior is robust against the deviation of the dot level from the fermi energy , even under the influence of magnetic field in the qd area .",
    "moreover , out of simple expectation , if the dot level @xmath16 is far away from the fermi energy ( e.g. @xmath68 ) , the josephson current is reduced by @xmath65 much more modestly , than in the case of @xmath58 , see , e.g. , the results in fig .  [ fig3](a ) and ( d ) .",

    "this means that , for a bent majorana - josephson junction , the stronger the resonance condition is violated , a larger supercurrent will flow through the junction .",

    "the other four phase - difference ( @xmath62 ) dependent eigen - energies are from the coupling of the states @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . to be more specific , the two majoranas @xmath84 and @xmath85 couple commonly to the spin - up dot state , resulting in the ` crossing ' structure at zero energy at @xmath61 , which is similar to the result of direct coupling of two majoranas.@xcite it is just owing to this zero - energy crossing ( at the fermi energy ) that the large josephson current with abrupt jump is resulted in , in the presence of ` relaxation ' or thermal equilibrium .",
    "second , for the dot level @xmath67 but @xmath3 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) ] , the majorana states @xmath80 and @xmath81 have also the flat zero - energy ( independent of @xmath62 ) ; however , the energies of @xmath82 and @xmath83 move to @xmath16 and @xmath88 , respectively",
    ". these would lead to an opening of the high - energy crossing at @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) , but still keeping the zero - energy crossings at @xmath61 caused by @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as a result",

    "[ fig5](a ) ] , we see that the zero - energy degeneracy of @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath61 is removed .",
    "the disappearance of the zero - energy crossings leads to a strong reduction of the josephson current and rounding the jump to smooth transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .    finally , for the case of both @xmath4 and @xmath91 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and ( c ) , the absence of efficient energy level interaction between the majorana and qd states ( owing to @xmath67 ) does not remove the zero - energy degeneracy of @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath61 . then ,",
    "the zero - energy crossing structure of the energy spectrum at @xmath61 results in a large josephson current with abrupt jumps , despite that the dot level @xmath16 deviates far from the fermi energy .",
    "below we show that , in order to observe the featured behaviors discussed above , the overlap of the majorana wavefunctions at the ends of the same nanowire should be negligibly small . or , equivalently , the majorana interaction should be negligibly small . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we display the result for @xmath92 , which corresponds to nonzero coupling between the two majoranas in the same nanowire .",

    "[ fig6](a ) and ( c ) ] .",

    "<S> the josephson supercurrent through the hybrid majorana  quantum dot  majorana junction is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we particularly analyze the effect of spin - selective coupling between the majorana and quantum dot states , which emerges only in the topological phase and will influence the current through bent junctions and/or in the presence of magnetic fields in the quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the characteristic behaviors of the supercurrent through this system are quite counterintuitive , remarkably differing from the resonant tunneling , e.g. , through the similar ( normal phase ) superconductor  quantum dot  superconductor junction . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is carried out under the influence of full set - up parameters and for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 periodic currents . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is expected to be relevant to future exploration of applications of the majorana - nanowire circuits . </S>"
