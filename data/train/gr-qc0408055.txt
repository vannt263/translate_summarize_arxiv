    "the lisa mission consists in three spacecraft ( s / c ) to be launched over the next decade in order to implement laser interferometry in space for the observation of gravitational waves of galactic , extra - galactic , and potentially cosmological origin .",
    "the s / c will be placed on heliocentric orbit in a triangular configuration , where each arm of the triangle will be approximately @xmath0 m long .",
    "gravitational waves will be detected by monitoring the relative position of the s / c with high accuracy , leading to a gravitational wave strain sensitivity of @xmath1 from 0.1 mhz to 0.1 hz .",
    "one of the most significant technical challenge to achieve this level of accuracy is the cancellation of the laser phase noise .",
    "a number of signal processing techniques , known as time delay interferometry ( tdi ) , have been developed in order to synthesize noise - cancelling interferometers from the various phase measurements that lisa will provide @xcite .",
    "while these techniques will certainly be very useful , they impose a number of relatively strict requirements on the system @xcite , such as a good knowledge of the arm lengths at all time , precise synchronization of the clocks between s / c , etc .",
    "an intriguing idea was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to significantly reduce the laser phase noise : the very stable arms of the lisa constellation could be used as frequency references to lock the lasers .",
    "we describe the control loop topology proposed by @xcite ( referred to as `` laser self - locking '' ) in section [ lockingscheme ] , where we also present a time domain analysis of the behavior of the transients introduced by the locking procedure .",
    "we then present in section [ numericalsimulations ] the results from a set of realistic numerical simulations of lisa with laser self - locking , where all standard secondary noises are included , and where the orbital motion of the s / c is approximately included .",
    "we finally show in section [ timedelayinterferometry ] results for the use of tdi to bring the reduced laser phase noise below the other noises .",
    "we describe in particular how some of the technical challenges of implementing tdi in lisa s baseline design are simplified by using laser self - locking .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ fig : topology ] , we use the same locking scheme as @xcite , although we add realistic acceleration and optical noises to our model .",
    "open loop laser noises @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generated on - board s / c 1 and 3 , respectively .",
    "they then follow a similar path .",
    "@xmath2 is collimated by the telescope on s / c 1 , where it acquires noise @xmath4 from the s / c motion , before being propagated down arm 2 towards s / c 3 . upon reception after a travel time @xmath5@xcite , it is exposed to the noise @xmath6 from the motion of s / c 3 .",
    "it is bounced off the proof mass ( acquiring s / c noise @xmath7 and proof mass acceleration noise @xmath8 ) , and interacts with the local laser on a photodiode , where the optical noise @xmath9 is added to produce the electrical signal @xmath10 .",
    "this signal would be the normal phase measurement in the absence of locking . in the present configuration ,",
    "however , the signal @xmath10 is fed back to the laser phase actuator through a controller @xmath11 in order to close the control loop .",
    "the equations that relate @xmath12 and @xmath13 to the other noises and to the controllers gain are derived in @xcite .",
    "although the authors of @xcite note the presence of a strong , slowly decaying quasiperiodic signal with period equal to the round - trip light - time , they do not include it explicitly in their expressions for the noise spectra .",
    "this fact was first pointed out by tinto @xcite and others . however",
    ", we show below that the quality factor of this signal is very high , so that its power spectrum consists only in narrow peaks at harmonics of the inverse of the round - trip light - time .",
    "its effect on data analysis should therefore be negligible , just like high quality factor oscillations from wire resonances , for instance , have a negligible effect on the data analysis for ground - based interferometers .    as a simplification of the diagram of fig .",

    "[ eq : lockl ] must vanish . using eq .",

    "it is also straightforward to show that the function @xmath33 is mostly defined by the open loop laser noise from both s / c in the time @xmath5 just after the loops are closed . colloquially , the lasers `` load '' the arm buffer with @xmath34 s of noise after the loops are closed .",
    "as soon as light reaches the other s / c , the lasers will try to track the phase of the light stored in the arm , so that the initial noise effectively becomes a reference signal for future frequency measurements in the closed loop configuration .      according to fig . [",
    "fig : topology ] , we assume that the electronic signal out of the phasemeter on every s / c is filtered by a high gain digital controller , and is fed back to the laser using a phase actuator , which frequency response is described by a pole at dc ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "this dc pole provides a @xmath35 attenuation , and a phase shift of @xmath36 radian at all frequencies .",
    "in addition , the time delay for the propagation of the light down the arms provides a transfer function with a significant attenuation and a @xmath37 phase shift at low frequencies .",
    "its amplitude goes to zero at multiples of the frequency defined by the inverse of the round - trip light - time , where the phase also drops to @xmath36 .    in order to have a controller that is stable at all times during the ramping up of its gain , the total phase of the phase actuator , time delay , and controller transfer functions must be larger than @xmath38 at all frequencies by some phase margin @xmath39 .",
    "we chose a conservative @xmath40 rad .",
    "well below the first round - trip light - time resonance at 0.03 hz , the phase shift from the delay line cancels the phase shift from the phase actuator , so that @xmath41 is available to the controller , and a steep roll - off of @xmath42 is possible ( @xmath43 with the actuator dc pole ) . at its first",
    "null , the phase of the time delay transfer function is @xmath36 , so we have to provide @xmath44 of phase compensation at 30 mhz . given the @xmath45 response from the actuator , the gain then goes as @xmath42 . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the phase shift resonances are closely spaced , so we must also provide @xmath44 of phase compensation at all frequencies and maintain the @xmath42 attenuation .    this design was used to construct the controller with response shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bode ] ( note that the top two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : bode ] include the effect of the dc pole of the phase actuator ) .",
    "the gain was scaled to provide a unity gain frequency around 10 khz , so that this controller provides close to 180 db of attenuation at 0.1 mhz .",
    "although a bit more gain might be obtained by better fitting the optimal phase response ( @xmath46 ) around 10 mhz and below , this controller is a fairly aggressive design that allows the investigation of the limits of the self - locking procedure .",
    "circles and crosses represent the frequency location of zeros and poles , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=288 ]",
    "an optimized code was used to simulate the system with realistic parameters . at a sampling frequency of 100 khz , open loop laser noise with an approximate @xmath47 power spectrum was generated by summing successive data from a white noise series . at the first time step , each open loop laser noise datum was propagated through the diagram of figure [ fig : topology ] in order to calculate @xmath48 and @xmath10 , as if the feedback through the controller was not present . at the second time step , the values of @xmath48 and @xmath10 obtained from the first time step , and filtered by the controller response @xmath11 or @xmath49 ,",
    "were also added to the open loop laser noise .",
    "this procedure was then repeated for all other time steps , effectively producing an integration of the system through the equivalent of the euler scheme .",
    "the proof mass acceleration noise ( @xmath50 ) was an approximate @xmath47 noise generated like the open loop laser noise , while the optical path noise ( @xmath51 ) and the spacecraft acceleration noise ( @xmath52 ) approximately had @xmath53 power spectra , and were generated by taking the difference of successive data in a white noise series . at 1 mhz , the ratio of the rms values @xmath54 was @xmath55 .",
    "a strong anti - aliasing low - pass filter with corner frequency at 1 hz was applied to the @xmath53 noises in order to avoid the aliasing of high frequency noise back to lower frequencies when the arms lengths were changing . for an arm length rate of change @xmath56 , a given noise perturbation at frequency @xmath57",
    "is doppler shifted to a different frequency @xmath58 for every arm round - trip . over hundreds or thousands of round - trips ,",
    "a high frequency perturbation can easily be pushed above the nyquist frequency , and be aliased back to contaminate the measurement spectrum .",
    "the propagation delay down the arm was simulated using a data buffer with varying length . at",
    "any given time , the transmitted value was taken from the linear interpolation between the two nearest points in time .",
    "the interpolation was critical in order to prevent the introduction of numerical artifacts in the calculations .",
    "@xcite shows that the motion of the s / c can be modeled by arm lengths that are varying with time in a sinusoidal manner .",
    "the peak rates of change of two of the three arms are approximately equal ( @xmath59 m / s ) , and are significantly less than that of the third arm ( @xmath60 m / s ) , while the period of the variation of the third arm length is longer that the period of the other two arms by a factor of @xmath61 ( 1 year vs. 4 months ) . as a rough approximation of these orbits , we assume a constant rate of change that is equal to 1 m / s for arm 1 , and 10 m / s for arm 2 .",
    "all arm - lengths are assumed to be 16.7 s at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : psd ] shows the amplitude spectra of the laser noise ( closed and open loop ) for the 10 m / s arm change , together with the theoretical expectations for a @xmath47 noise and for the closed loop noise .",
    "the closed loop model is constructed from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 12 ) ) , using the known response of our controller .",
    "the fit is excellent , except in the vicinity of the resonances at multiples of the inverse of the round - trip light - time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psd_zoom ] ) . at those frequencies ,",
    "the large quasiperiodic transient introduces additional noise .",

    ", the relative phase between the two lasers is measured by bouncing the light from one laser off the proof mass on its optical bench , and then sending the reflected light through an optical fiber to the other optical bench , where it interferes on a photodiode with the laser from that bench .",

    "successive versions of tdi variables of increasing complexity have been developed for lisa configurations with static arms @xcite , and for rotating and stretching arms @xcite .",

    "our results show that the same level of noise can be achieved as in the baseline design where no locking is used , except in narrow bands at the frequency defined by the inverse of the round - trip light - time , and its harmonics .",
    "since the laser noise is much smaller when self - locking is used , the accuracy on the arm lengths required to implement tdi can be significantly less stringent than in the baseline design , @xmath84s vs. @xmath85 ns . we also verify that the first generation tdi variable @xmath77 can bring the laser phase noise below the secondary noises , even in the presence of significant time dependent changes of the arm lengths ( `` flexing '' ) .",
    "our results suggest that laser self - locking could be used to move technical complexity and risk from the implementation of second generation tdi to the implementation of the control loops required to lock the lasers .",
    "it appears that self - locking and the baseline design are mostly equivalent from the point of view of the instrument sensitivity , so that the viability of both schemes should be carefully evaluated from an engineering point of view . in particular , it should be verified that more detailed orbital models , which might include rotation of the constellation in addition to the stretching of the arms , do not lead to degraded performances for the self - locking scheme .",
