    "the positron source for the international linear collider ( ilc ) is based on a helical undulator  @xcite . before collisions , the accelerated electron beam passes the superconducting helical undulator and creates an intense circularly polarized multi - mev photon beam .",
    "the photons hit a positron target and create in an electromagnetic shower longitudinally polarized positrons ( and electrons ) .",
    "this method was suggested by balakin and mikhailichenko  @xcite and has been successfully tested with the e-166 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the baseline parameters of the ilc positron source afford a positron polarization of 30% .",
    "the distribution of polarization within the photon beam depends on the radial position of the photons , so it is possible to increase the average polarization of positrons by collimation from 30% up to 50 - 60% .",
    "however , the collimation of the photon beam causes huge thermal load in the collimator material . in this paper ,",
    "a photon collimator design is discussed which is based on studies of the dynamic load in the collimator material . in section  [ sec : e+source ] the ilc positron source is described , the photon collimator system is presented in section  [ sec : colli ] . the thermal load as well as the cooling are discussed in section  [ sec : heatload+cool ] ; potential problems due to cyclic maximum load and degradation are considered in section  [ sec : problems ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : alternative ] ideas for alternatives of the photon collimator design are presented which could overcame the drawback of the design presented here .",
    "the ilc technical design report ( tdr )  @xcite describes the machine parameters to get electron - positron collisions at centre - of - mass energies of 500gev , 350gev and 250gev and also 1tev .",
    "trains of 1312 bunches ( high luminosity option : 2625 bunches ) with 2@xmath210@xmath3 electrons / positrons per bunch are repeated with a frequency of 5hz .",
    "the scheme of positron production is shown in figure  [ fig : source - sketch ] .",
    "the superconducting helical undulator has a period of @xmath4 mm and is located at a distance of 400 m upstream the positron target .",
    "depending on the electron beam energy and the desired polarization , the undulator k value varies from @xmath5 up to @xmath6 .",
    "the length of the undulator is determined by the requirement to generate 1.5 positrons per drive beam electron and amounts up to 231 m maximum .",
    "[ ilc_target_wheel ]    the degree of photon polarization depends on the angular distribution of the photons .",
    "the intensity of the undulator radiation has the maximum around the beam axis . by cutting the outer part of the radial symmetric photon beam with a collimator",
    ", the positron polarization is increased by contemporaneous decreasing the positron yield .",
    "the yield of 1.5e@xmath7/e@xmath8 can be recovered by increasing the active length of the undulator and choosing @xmath9 .",
    "table  [ tab : e+pol ] illustrates the relation between undulator - k values , collimator aperture , active length of the undulator and expected degree of positron beam polarization using a flux concentrator as optical matching device with parameters described in the tdr  @xcite .",
    "depending on the electron beam energy and the k value , the positron polarization approaches 29% for @xmath10 mm up to 50 - 60% if the photon beam radii are collimated to @xmath11 mm ( see also @xcite and table  [ tab : collpar ] ) .",
    ".expected positron polarization , @xmath12 , for different undulator k values and photon collimator iris radii at @xmath13gev , high luminosity . the active undulator length , @xmath14 ,",
    "is adjusted to achieve the positron yield of 1.5e@xmath7/e@xmath8 for the nominal luminosity corresponding to 1312 bunches per train .",
    "the undulator period is @xmath15 mm . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a high degree of positron polarization is desired for physics studies and can be achieved by collimating the undulator photon beam . due to the close correlation between energy of the electron beam which passes the helical undulator , photon beam intensity , collimator iris and degree of polarization , the photon collimator system must be flexible .",
    "further , it has to withstand huge heat loads without breakdown during a long operation time .",
    "the multistage collimator design presented in this paper represents a solution to collimate the photon beam at the ilc positron source . for centre - of - mass energies up to 500gev ,",
    "the material loads stay within acceptable limits taking into account an additionally safety margin against failure due to fatigue stress .",
    "depending on the centre - of - mass energy , one , two or all three stages are used to collimate the photon beam .",
    "the system is water - cooled , the principal parameters of the cooling system are given .",
    "the presented solution can be adopted to electron beam energies up to 500gev . however ,",
    "further simulation studies are recommended to optimize the design taking into account the special material properties as swelling of pyrolytic graphite or potential change of properties of the material due to long - term irradiation .",
    "this will further improve the reliability of the final design .",
