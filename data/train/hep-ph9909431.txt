    "@xmath32 , or more precisely : @xmath33 where the range quoted corresponds to the @xmath34 error above ( which is largely statistical ) .",
    "the apparent lack of @xmath26 mixing at the atmospheric scale , is supported by independent data from the chooz reactor @xcite ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which rules out large @xmath26 mixing over most of the @xmath35 range allowed in the atmospheric neutrino experiments .    taken together ,",
    "the chooz and super - k data indicate that the @xmath31 has no @xmath26 content , ie .",
    "there is a zero ( or near - zero ) in the top right - hand corner of the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath36 @xmath25 @xmath37 .",
    "remarkably , the fritzsch - xing hypothesis @xcite ( published well before the initial chooz data ) predicted just such a zero : @xmath38 the fritzsch - xing ansatz ( eq .  11 ) is readily obtained from theeefold maximal mixing ( eq .",
    "5 ) by the re - definitions : @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( up to phases ) , keeping the @xmath41 tri - maximally mixed . while the _ a priori _ argument for these particular linear combinations @xcite is far from convincing , it is clear that eq .",
    "11 is so far consistent with the atmospheric data : @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "eq .  9 ) ,",
    "while beyond the second threshold : @xmath43 the famous ` bi - maximal ' scheme @xcite is very similar to the fritzsch - xing ansatz and likewise predicts a @xmath44% suppression for the solar data .",
    "taken at face value , the results from the various solar neutrino experiments imply an energy dependent suppression . in particular , taking bp98 fluxes ( and correcting for the nc contribution in super - k ) , the results from homestake and super - k : @xmath45 , lie significantly below the results from the gallium experiments : @xmath46 , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "mindful of the popularity of the large - angle msw solution and the undenied phenomenological promise of the ` original ' bi - maximal scheme @xcite , we have ourselves proposed @xcite , a phenomenologically viable ( and even phenomenologically favoured ) _ a posteriori _ ` straw - man ' alternative to tri - maximal mixing :    @xmath47    which we refer to here as ` optimised ' bi - maximal mixing .",
    "this scheme is of course just one special case of the ` generalised ' bi - naximal hypotheses of altarelli and feruglio @xcite ( and see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the atmospheric scale eq .  14",
    "gives : @xmath48 while beyond the second scale it gives : @xmath49 there is then the added possibility to exploit a large angle msw solution with the base of the ` bathtub ' ( given by the @xmath26 content of the @xmath50 ) given by @xmath51 , as shown in fig .",
    "although clearly the matrix eq .",
    "14 is readily obtained from the tri - maximal mixing matrix eq .  5 by forming linear combinations of the heaviest and lightest mass eigenstates : @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( up to phases ) , with the @xmath50 remaining tri - maximally mixed",

    "15 ) while the @xmath26 rate is fully compensated : @xmath64 so that @xmath26 appear not to participate in the mixing .    the up / down ratio ( fig .  5 ) measures the effective supression . for energies @xmath65",
    "@xmath66 @xmath67 gev the initial flux ratio @xmath60 @xmath66 @xmath62 and the @xmath26 rate becomes ` over - compensated ' , while , for sufficiently high energies compensation effects vanish as the complete decoupling limit @xmath68 is approached .",
    "the resulting maximum in the up / down ratio for @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "5 ) is describerd as a ` resonance ' by pantaleone @xcite .",
    "as regards the mixing matrix , cp and t violating effects are maximal in tri - maximal mixing , but in spite of this , due to the extreme hierarchy of @xmath35 values involved , for most accessible @xmath69 values , observable asymmetries are expected to be unmeasurably small ( in vacuum ) .    in the presence of matter ( or indeed anti - matter ) significant asymmetries can occur , however , ` enhanced ' or ` induced ' by matter effects . thus for example if atmospheric neutrinos are separated @xmath70 , interesting matter induced asymmetries become observable ( fig .",
    "6 ) in tri - maximal mixing .",
    "such effects could be investigated using atmospheric neutrino detectors equipped with magnetic fields @xcite , and/or by using sign - selected beams in long - baseline experiments @xcite .",
    "the vacuum predictions for the solar data in tri - maximal mixing are largely unmodified by matter effects in the sun , as is well known , or , as we have seen , by matter effects in the earth ( eq .  7 vs.  eq .",
    "thus we expect @xmath71 in tri - maximal mixing with no energy dependence , as shown in fig .  7 .",

    "7 , the @xmath73b ( and @xmath74be ) flux , affecting both the super - k and homestake data - points , has been rescaled by an arbitrary factor ( 0.72 ) for comparison to the energy - independent prediction .",
    "given the flux errors ( @xmath75 for @xmath73b @xcite ) , the fit ( fig .",
    "7 ) seems not unreasonable .",
    "8 shows the solar , atmospheric , accelerator and reactor data in overall perspective , within the tri - maximal context .",
    "note that _ dis_-appearance results _ only _ are represented : if the lsnd appearance result @xcite were ever to be confirmed , tri - maximal mixing would be instantly excluded .",
    "the lepton mixing really does look to be either tri - maximal or bi - naximal at this point .",
    "tri - maximal mixing is currently ` squeezed ' in @xmath35 by chooz vs.  super - k ( fig .  1 - 2 ) .",
    "for some @xmath72 , bi - maximal mixing ( in particular the ` optimised ' version discussed here ) clearly fits the data better .",
    "tri - maximal mixing remains , however , the ` simplest ' most ` symmetric ' possibility .",
