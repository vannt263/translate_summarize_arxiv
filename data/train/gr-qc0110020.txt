    "by the beginning of 2001 the installation of the main optics of the gravitational wave detector geo600 @xcite has been well under way .",
    "the nd : yag laser source and the mode cleaners were completely installed .",
    "the frequency and length control system as well as an automatic alignment system for the mode cleaners were installed .",
    "these systems are operated in a fully automated , remotely controllable fashion and provide the input beam for an interferometer in the main vacuum system . in addition , three main mirrors were suspended , the _ power recycling mirror _ , the _ folding mirror _ and the _ end mirror _ of one arm of the michelson interferometer ( see figure  [ fig : prc_layout ] ) . these mirrors form a cavity with 2400 m round trip length , which is very similar to the power recycling cavity in a recycled michelson interferometer . this enabled us to perform a first test of the length and frequency control .",
    "the cavity is the first large - scale optical system we have operated in geo600 and the _ first arm _ of the detector .",
    "the laser system of geo600 is an injection locked master and slave system with 14w output power at 1064 nm @xcite . after leaving the laser ,",
    "the light is passed through two successive mode cleaners @xcite .",
    "the mode cleaners are ring cavities with 8 m round trip length and three mirrors each , which are suspended as double pendulums .",
    "the measured optical parameters of the two mode cleaners are shown in table [ tab : mc ] .",
    "the main optical instrument in geo600 will be a dual - recycled michelson interferometer @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other interferometric gravitational wave projects @xcite , geo600 does not employ arm cavities but folded arms ( see figure  [ fig : layout1 ] ) .",
    "the laser light enters the main instrument from the west ( w ) at the _ power recycling mirror _ ( pm ) and is split into an east ( e ) and a north arm ( n ) at the beam splitter ( bs ) . at a distance of 600 m from the beam splitter",
    "each arm has a _ folding mirror _ ( fm ) that directs the beam back ( slightly tilted ) towards the beam splitter .",
    "the light hits the _",
    "end mirror _",
    "( em ) located close to the beam splitter 25 cm above the axis of the injected beam . in the final optical layout",
    "the beams reflected from the two end mirrors are superimposed on the beam splitter .",
    "the michelson interferometer will be held on the so called _ dark fringe _ , where the tiny phase modulation sidebands containing the gravitational wave signal are directed south ( s ) towards the _ signal recycling mirror _ ( sm ) .",
    "the major part of the light power ( the carrier ) is reflected back to the power recycling mirror .",
    "thus the power recycling mirror and the michelson interferometer form a cavity for the carrier light of 2400 m round trip length , the _ power recycling cavity_.    @clll mode cleaner & finesse & throughput & visibility + mc1 & 2700 & 80% & 94% + mc2 & 1900 & 72% & 92% +    all main mirrors are suspended as triple pendulums to give a very good seismic isolation in the direction of the optical axis @xcite . by january 2001",
    "three main mirrors had been installed .",
    "the east arm was fully equipped with the end mirror and the folding mirror .",
    "furthermore , the power recycling mirror was in place .",
    "the beam splitter was left out so that the three mirrors formed a fabry - perot cavity ( see figure  [ fig : prc_layout ] ) , which is very similar to the power recycling cavity of the final detector .",
    "for the experiment described here the master laser ( ml ) , an 1w non - planar ring oscillator ( npro ) , was used as light source , with the 14w amplifier ( sl ) being bypassed .",
    "the laser frequency stabilisation scheme used in geo600 is unique because it does not include any rigid reference cavity .",
    "instead cavities with suspended mirrors are used .",
    "the suspended cavities provide a very good reference for frequencies above 50hz because of their excellent seismic isolation .",
    "the optical systems and the feedback systems are shown in figure  [ fig : chain ] .",
    "the frequency of the laser is locked to the first mode cleaner using a standard pound - drever - hall method ( mc1 loop ) .",
    "the feedback is applied to the frequency modulation input of the master laser .",
    "the bandwidth of this control loop is 100khz .",
    "the next step is to pass the light through the second mode cleaner .",
    "to do so we have to bring the injected light into resonance with the second mode cleaner by changing the length of the first mode cleaner and thus the laser frequency .",
    "this is done with a feedback control system using another pound - drever - hall error signal ( mc2 loop ) .",
    "the control signal is split and fed back to two actuators : the slow fourier components ( @xmath1khz ) are applied to the length of mode cleaner mc1 via coil magnet actuators on one of its mirrors , while the fast components are injected into the error point of the mc1 loop , i.e. they directly act on the master laser frequency ( see figure  [ fig : chain ] ) .",
    "the fast feedback path is necessary to achieve a high servo bandwidth ( about 25khz ) and thus a high gain at low fourier frequencies .",
    "finally the pre - stabilised light has to be resonant in the power recycling cavity . a third control loop ( pr loop ) with yet another pound - drever - hall scheme",
    "is used to control the length of mode cleaner mc2 accordingly .",
    "the feedback of this loop was split into a ` slow ' path , which acts on the length of the second mode cleaner ( by moving one of its mirrors ) , and a ` fast ' path .",
    "the fast signal is applied to an electro - optic modulator in front of the power recycling cavity that serves as a fast phase corrector . in the experiment",
    "described here the control bandwidth of the pr loop was 40khz .    in order to measure the performance of the frequency stabilisation one can perform two different experiments : a ) an in - loop measurement of the frequency noise",
    "( this is done by taking the error point spectrum of the frequency control loop ) or b ) an out - of - loop measurement of the residual frequency noise of a stabilised laser with respect to an independent frequency reference .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc_old_new ] shows the error point spectrum of the mc1 loop that stabilises the master laser to the first mode cleaner .",
    "the frequency noise in the error point is about 1mhz/@xmath2 below 1khz . in comparison with the typical frequency noise of a free running npro",
    "one can see the gain of the servo loop , e.g. 100db at 100hz .    the master and slave laser system can be treated as a black box from the outside in the sense that the frequency of the slave laser is following the frequency of the master laser and that thus the slave inherits the frequency stability of the master .",
    "the injection locking controls the slave laser frequency with a higher bandwidth than the servo loops that apply feedback to the frequency of the master laser .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc_old_new ] also shows a comparison of the error signal of the mc1 loop for a ) the master laser only and b ) the master plus injection locked slave .",
    "it can be seen that the laser frequency noise is very similar in both cases .",
    "the servo electronics of the mc1 loop were not changed between the two measurements .    with two mode cleaner cavities one can also use the second mode cleaner as an independent reference ( apart from common - mode effects caused by suspending both mode cleaners from the same mechanical structure in their vacuum tanks ) to measure the performance of the laser frequency stabilisation to the first mode cleaner .",
    "this is an out - of - loop measurement of the frequency noise and the result is shown in figure  [ fig : in_out ] . for this measurement",
    "the laser was locked to the first mode cleaner as usual .",
    "then the first mode cleaner was locked to the second as described above ( mc2 loop ) but with a very low servo bandwidth ( unity gain frequency @xmath3 300hz ) .",
    "the frequency noise in the error signal of the mc2 loop then gives the residual frequency noise of the mc1 loop for fourier frequencies above the unity gain frequency of the mc2 loop .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : in_out ] the measured out - of - loop noise floor is about 10  30mhz/@xmath2 below 1khz and very close to the sensor noise of the mc1 loop , i.e. the electronic noise of the photo diode .",
    "we believe that the shot noise limit can be reached by increasing the light power on the photo diode by a factor of 5 .",
    "we also measured the out - of - loop frequency noise of the mc2 loop with respect to the power recycling cavity .",
    "this measurement showed that the out - of - loop frequency noise of the mc2 loop and that of the mc1 loop are very similar . as both mode cleaners are similar cavities with common noise sources the frequency noise can only be improved a little by the second control loop .",
    "this is different for the power recycling cavity : the cavity has a much smaller bandwidth ( 400hz in this experiment ) and the length of 1200 m greatly improves the relative stability .",
    "also this cavity uses triple pendulum suspensions for its mirrors , so that the absolute motion of the mirrors is less than that of the mode cleaner mirrors with their double pendulum suspension for fourier frequencies above 10hz .",
    "thus the power recycling cavity can be used as a stable frequency reference and by stabilising the mode cleaners and the laser light to the power recycling cavity length , the frequency noise can be further improved ( see next section ) .",
    "the mode cleaner system was completed in december 2000 .",
    "both cavities were automatically aligned and the lock acquisition of the length control loops was fully automated .",
    "the servo systems for the length control use analog electronic devices .",
    "they can be guided by a computer system via a digital bus @xcite to automate lock acquisition of the full optical system .",
    "therefore in normal operation no human interaction is required .",
    "we thus had a stable input beam for the experiment with the 1200 m cavity .",
    "the three mirrors of this cavity were without any alignment control and thus had to be aligned manually for every experiment .",
    "when a reasonably good alignment was established one could observe fringes in the light reflected from the long cavity .",
    "a numerical simulation was used to fit a model function to a measured time series of the reflected light power of the 1200 m long cavity ( see figure  [ fig : fringe ] ) .",
    "the simulation works in the time domain and calculates the dynamic changes of the light power inside a cavity after an incident laser beam comes into resonance with the cavity . in our case",
    "the cavity was assumed to be rigid while the frequency of the incoming beam is subject to a sweep ( the effect is the same as for a cavity with moving mirrors that is illuminated by a light source with fixed frequency @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption can be made because the relative stability of the 1200 m long cavity is much better than that of the mode cleaners , which function at that time the reference for the laser frequency .",
    "the particular fringe shown in figure  [ fig : fringe ] was chosen because it could be modeled with a simple linear frequency sweep .",
    "the parameters of the fitted model function showed that the finesse of the cavity ( with that particular alignment ) was 300 and the speed of the mirrors of the second mode cleaner was 20nm / s .",
    "this means that a control loop locking the incoming light to that cavity had to acquire lock in some milliseconds .",
    "the low minimum of the ringing in figure  [ fig : fringe ] shows that the mode matching is better than 90% .",
    "the finesse of 300 corresponds to a loss inside the cavity of 0.7% .    to stabilise the incoming light to the resonance of the 1200 m long cavity another feedback control featuring the third pound - drever - hall scheme was installed ( pr loop ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : prc_fb ] shows these feedback signals during lock acquisition .",
    "the servo loop was closed automatically during a fringe at time zero .",
    "it can be seen that the cavity acquired lock in 2ms and stayed in lock while a residual motion of the mirrors damped out quickly .",
    "the automation of the lock acquisition of this control loop was installed and worked reliably . without an alignment control of the cavity mirrors the continuous lock durations were limited by alignment drifts . however , we still achieved continuous lock periods of up to 10 hours , and the automation was able to relock the cavity over periods of up to 36 hours before the mirrors had to be realigned . for comparison ,",
    "the laser and mode cleaner systems which were under automated alignment control @xcite typically achieved continuous lock times of 48 hours .",
    "the stable operation of the entire system over periods of 36 hours showed the stability of the involved subsystems , especially of the seismic isolation and the control electronics .",
    "for the geo600 detector in its final state the required frequency stability inside the power recycling cavity is 10@xmath4 at 100hz , which corresponds to a frequency stability of 100@xmath4 at 100hz for the injected light . for the intermediate experiment described here the goal was to achieve an in - loop frequency noise at this level .",
    "figure  [ fig : prc ] shows the in - loop noise ( i.e. the error point spectrum ) of the control loop for the 1200 m long cavity and the sensor noise of that loop .",
    "it can be seen that the goal mentioned above is met .    as of summer 2001",
    ", all main optics of the michelson interferometer had been installed and the power recycling cavity including a full interferometer is in place .",
    "this system has two longitudinal degrees of freedom , the michelson interferometer operating point ( differential arm length ) and the power recycling length ( common arm length plus the distance from the power recycling mirror to the beam splitter ) .",
    "the error signals for each degree of freedom depend strongly on the state of the other . in order to lock the michelson",
    "interferometer the power recycling cavity is stabilised first .",
    "the experience with the 30 m prototype interferometer in garching @xcite showed that this locking hierarchy works reliably . to compensate for the variable reflectivity of the michelson interferometer ( when the interferomter is not yet locked to the dark fringe )",
    ", an automatic gain control has been added to the servo system for the power recycling cavity .",
    "the otherwise unchanged servo system can lock the power recycling cavity long enough for about 4 or 5 slow fringes of the michelson interferometer to pass . during this time the michelson interferometer error signal allows the lock acquisition of the michelson interferometer .",
    "currently the servo system for the michelson interferometer control is tested .",
    "the _ 1200 m experiment _ described in this paper employed the first large - scale optical system in geo600 . with the laser , the two mode cleaner systems and a 1200 m long cavity we could demonstrate the frequency stabilisation system of geo600 .",
    "the required frequency noise reduction was achieved by stabilising the laser only to suspended cavities .",
    "the frequency and length control servos are automated and controlled by a computer system .",
    "the described system can acquire lock reliably and stay locked for 10 hour long periods .",
    "we demonstrated that the system works as expected so that the requirement for the laser frequency noise in geo600 gravitational wave detector can be met .",
    "the authors would like to thank the british particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) , the german bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) and the state of lower saxony ( germany ) .",
