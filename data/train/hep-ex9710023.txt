    "one of the outstanding issues in @xmath35 meson physics is the semileptonic branching fraction puzzle .",
    "experimentally @xmath36 is measured to be ( @xmath37)%  @xcite , whereas theoretical calculations have difficulties accommodating a branching fraction below @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "one way to reduce the theoretical expectations is through a two - fold enhancement in the assumed @xmath39 rate  @xcite , which is estimated to be @xmath40 from the measured inclusive rates for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "recently , buchalla _",
    "et  al._@xcite and blok _",
    "et  al._@xcite have suggested that a significant fraction of the @xmath39 transition hadronizes into @xmath43 .",
    "this is supported by cleo s",
    "@xcite observation of `` wrong - sign '' @xmath44 mesons from @xmath35 decays , @xmath45 , where the @xmath44 comes from the virtual @xmath46 .",
    "the aleph  @xcite and delphi  @xcite collaborations have also observed sizeable @xmath47 decay rates .",
    "exclusive @xmath35 decays involving wrong - sign @xmath44 mesons can result from ( 1 ) resonant @xmath48 decays , where the @xmath46 hadronizes to an excited @xmath5 meson that decays into @xmath49 ; and ( 2 ) non - resonant @xmath50 decays .",
    "this paper explores one possibility in the first case , namely , the decays @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the narrow p - wave @xmath5 meson with @xmath53 .",
    "the `` upper - vertex '' production of @xmath52 from @xmath46 hadronization is shown in figure  [ fig : feynman](a ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath52 mesons can be produced from `` lower - vertex '' decays @xmath54 with the creation of an @xmath55 quark pair , as shown in figure  [ fig : feynman](b ) .",
    "this produces right - sign @xmath44 mesons ; however , the decay rate is expected to be small . throughout this paper charge",
    "conjugate states are implied .",
    "continuum @xmath52 production has been thoroughly studied  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 is just above the @xmath56 mass threshold and decays dominantly into @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "other possible decay channels are negligible : @xmath59 due to isospin conservation , @xmath60 due to ozi suppression  @xcite , @xmath61 or @xmath62 due to angular momentum and parity conservation , and @xmath63 due to the small radiative decay rate .",
    "the data used in this analysis were selected from hadronic events collected by the cleo  ii detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the cleo  ii detector  @xcite is a large solenoidal detector with 67 tracking layers and a csi electromagnetic calorimeter that provides efficient @xmath64 reconstruction .",
    "the data consist of an integrated luminosity of 3.11 fb@xmath65 at the @xmath66 resonance , corresponding to @xmath67 @xmath68 events . to evaluate non-@xmath68 backgrounds we also collected 1.61 fb@xmath65 of `` continuum '' data 60 mev below the @xmath66 resonance .",
    "the inclusive @xmath69 decay is studied by reconstructing the decay channels @xmath70 and @xmath71 using the decay modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 is reconstructed using the decay modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "hadronic events are required to satisfy the ratio of fox - wolfram moments  @xcite @xmath77 to reduce the background from continuum events .",
    "charged tracks , except pions from @xmath78 decays , are required to be consistent with coming from the primary interaction point . charged kaon and pion candidates are identified using specific ionization ( @xmath79 ) and , when available , time - of - flight ( tof ) information . for kaon identification , we consider the relative probability for a charged track to be a kaon , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the @xmath82 probability for a given particle hypothesis .",
    "the requirement on @xmath83 depends on the decay mode of interest .",
    "pion candidates are identified by requiring the @xmath79 and , when available , tof information to be within 3 standard deviations ( @xmath84 ) of that expected for pions .",
    "we select @xmath78 candidates through the decay to @xmath85 by requiring a decay vertex displaced from the primary interaction point and a @xmath78 invariant mass within 10 mev / c@xmath86 of its nominal value .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath64 candidates through the decay to @xmath87 by requiring candidates to have an invariant mass within 2.5 standard deviations ( @xmath88 mev / c@xmath86 ) of the nominal @xmath64 mass .",
    "the @xmath89 and @xmath76 combinations are required to have a kaon identification of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , and an invariant mass within 15 and 25 mev / c@xmath86 ( @xmath92 ) of the nominal @xmath74 mass , respectively .",
    "in addition , we select regions of the @xmath93 dalitz plot to take advantage of the known resonant substructure  @xcite . for the @xmath70 mode ,",
    "the dalitz cut reduces the signal efficiency by 40% and the background by 80% .",
    "we relax the dalitz cut for the @xmath71 mode since the combinatoric background is substantially lower .",
    "the @xmath73 candidates are required to have a mass difference @xmath94 within 1.5 mev / c@xmath86 ( @xmath92 ) of the nominal value of 145.4 mev / c@xmath86 , where @xmath95 is the reconstructed invariant mass of @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath72 candidates are required to have a mass difference @xmath97 within 1.5 mev / c@xmath86 ( @xmath92 ) of the nominal value of 142.1 mev / c@xmath86 . to form @xmath52 candidates charged kaons",
    "are combined with @xmath98 candidates and @xmath78 s are combined with @xmath99 candidates .",
    "since the primary kaons from @xmath70 decays have low momentum , we can impose a stringent @xmath100 requirement on the @xmath101 with negligible loss of efficiency .",
    "the @xmath52 candidates are required to have a scaled momentum @xmath102 , which is the kinematic limit for @xmath69 decays .",
    "( we ignore the negligible contributions from @xmath103 decays . )",
    "upper - vertex @xmath52 production results in a maximum @xmath104 of 0.35 , and this requirement is imposed when determining the @xmath52 decay constant . the @xmath52 decay channels with @xmath64 s in the final state often have multiple @xmath52 candidates per event .",
    "we select the candidate with the highest @xmath82 probability of being a @xmath52 , which is derived from the invariant masses of the reconstructed @xmath64 , @xmath74 and @xmath105 mesons .",
    "the @xmath52 signal is identified using the @xmath56 mass difference , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the known masses  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 mass difference signal has a resolution that is two to four times smaller than the corresponding signal in the reconstructed @xmath56 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath110 and @xmath111 distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : mass diff ] , where the @xmath75 and @xmath76 modes have been added together .",
    "the data is fit with a gaussian signal and a threshold background function .",
    "the gaussian width is fixed to that expected from a geant - based monte carlo simulation  @xcite ( @xmath112 mev / c@xmath86 , depending on the mode ) and the mean is fixed to the measured @xmath52 mass difference from continuum data ( @xmath113 mev / c@xmath86 and @xmath114 mev / c@xmath86 . )",
    "we observe @xmath115 signal events in the @xmath57 mode and @xmath116 events in the @xmath71 mode .",
    "however , when the @xmath57 candidates are further subdivided into the @xmath75 and @xmath76 decay channels there is a discrepancy in the @xmath52 yields . as shown in figure  [ fig:2 d0 modes ] , we observe @xmath117 signal events in the @xmath110 distribution for the @xmath75 channel and @xmath118 @xmath52 signal events for the @xmath93 channel . after accounting for branching fractions and efficiencies , discussed below , this results in a @xmath119 discrepancy in the @xmath57 rates between the two @xmath74 modes .",
    "we can not rule out the fact that background sources may be contributing a false @xmath52 signal in the @xmath93 channel , but not in the @xmath75 channel .",
    "however , no such mechanism has been uncovered . to be conservative",
    ", we choose to quote only an upper limit for the decay @xmath69 .",
    "since the @xmath52 reconstruction efficiency increases rapidly with @xmath104 and the @xmath52 momentum distribution from @xmath35 decays is not known , we compute the inclusive @xmath69 branching fraction by dividing the data into four equal regions of @xmath104 from 0.05 to 0.45 and summing the efficiency corrected yields .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath58 branching fractions are equal according to isospin , and their ratio has been measured to be within 30% of unity  @xcite .",
    "we measure the branching fraction @xmath69 to be @xmath120 from the @xmath57 mode and @xmath121 from the @xmath71 mode , where the error is statistical only .",
    "the two measurements are statistically consistent . the @xmath104 distribution for our @xmath52 candidates is shown in figure  [ fig : xp dist ] .",
    "several cross - checks , shown in figure  [ fig : cross checks ] , were performed to corroborate the validity of the @xmath52 signal . the scaled continuum background from data after satisfying all selection cuts is negligible , and there is no excess in the @xmath110 signal region ( @xmath122 events ) . the uncertainty in the continuum @xmath52 contribution is included in the systematic error .",
    "there is also no evidence of peaking in the @xmath110 signal region for wrong - sign @xmath123 combinations ( @xmath124 events ) , @xmath74 mass sidebands ( @xmath125 events ) , and @xmath98 mass sidebands ( @xmath126 events ) .",
    "we have also searched for the @xmath74 signal from @xmath127 candidates in the @xmath110 signal region , @xmath128 mev / c@xmath129 mev / c@xmath86 , by relaxing the @xmath74 mass cut and histogramming the invariant mass of all @xmath89 and @xmath76 combinations that satisfy the remaining selection criteria . in events with multiple candidates per @xmath74 decay mode",
    "we select the candidate with the highest @xmath82 probability , which is derived from the reconstructed @xmath64 and @xmath52 masses . we observe @xmath130 @xmath74 events . however , there are also real @xmath74 s in the random @xmath57 combinations under the @xmath52 peak ; after a @xmath110 sideband subtraction the @xmath74 invariant mass spectrum yields @xmath131 events ( see figure  [ fig : d0 yield](a ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with our @xmath70 yield in figure  [ fig : mass diff ] .",
    "similarly , we have studied the @xmath98 signal from @xmath127 candidates in the @xmath110 signal region .",
    "we observe @xmath132 @xmath74 events . as in the @xmath74 case",
    "there are also real @xmath98 s in the random @xmath57 combinations under the @xmath52 peak . after a @xmath110 sideband subtraction the @xmath98 mass difference spectrum yields @xmath133 events ( see figure  [ fig : d0 yield](b ) ) , consistent with our @xmath70 yield .",
    "finally , we have studied the @xmath52 production from continuum @xmath134 events .",
    "the selection criteria is similar to that used to find @xmath52 from @xmath35 decays , but since continuum charm production has a hard fragmentation , we require @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , we remove the @xmath136 cut , relax the charged kaon identification to @xmath137 , and remove the dalitz cut for @xmath93 .",
    "the mass difference distribution for @xmath57 and @xmath71 combinations are shown in figure  [ fig : continuum ] , where the @xmath75 and @xmath76 modes have been added together .",
    "we extract the @xmath52 signal by fitting the data with a gaussian signal and a threshold background function .",
    "the gaussian width is fixed to the value predicted by monte carlo ( 2.1 mev / c@xmath86 ) , and the mean is allowed to float .",
    "we observe @xmath138 events in the @xmath70 mode with a mass difference of @xmath139 mev / c@xmath86 ( statistical error only ) , and @xmath140 events in the @xmath141 mode with a mass difference of @xmath142 mev / c@xmath86 .",
    "the results are consistent with the previous cleo analysis  @xcite .",
    "there are several sources of systematic error .",
    "we assign a systematic error of 16% to account for the @xmath119 discrepancy between the @xmath57 rates for the @xmath75 and @xmath76 modes .",
    "this accomodates different methods of computing the weighted average of the @xmath69 branching fraction from the four separate decay chains .",
    "uncertainties due to reconstruction efficiencies include 1.5% per charged track , 5% per @xmath64 , 5% for slow pions from @xmath105 , and 5% for @xmath78 .",
    "we also include systematic errors of 7% for monte carlo statistics , 5% for kaon identification and the dalitz decay cut efficiency , 4% for uncertainties in the yield for @xmath143 , and 8% for uncertainties in the continuum @xmath52 contribution that passes our selection criteria .",
    "the total systematic error is 24% .    averaging the @xmath57 and @xmath71 modes together",
    ", we obtain @xmath144 . since the @xmath52 signal is observed largely in only one decay mode @xmath70 with @xmath93 , and since there is a discrepancy between this mode and the corresponding mode involving @xmath75 , we instead prefer to quote an upper limit on the branching fraction to be @xmath145 at the 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite this decay rate limit is small relative to the total rate expected for @xmath2 of about @xmath146 from the wrong - sign @xmath44 meson yield in @xmath35 decays  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising considering the @xmath147 system has appreciable phase space beyond the @xmath52 mass  @xcite .",
    "also , cleo s  @xcite recent observation of exclusive @xmath50 decays shows that the @xmath148 invariant mass distribution lies mostly above the @xmath52 mass .",
    "measurement of the @xmath69 decay rate also provides an estimate of the @xmath52 decay constant , @xmath149 , assuming that the @xmath52 comes dominantly from upper - vertex decays .",
    "the inclusive decay rate for @xmath35 mesons into ground state or excited @xmath5 mesons can be calculated assuming factorization  @xcite , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the bsw  @xcite parameter for the effective charged current , and @xmath152 is a kinematic factor with @xmath153 and @xmath154 . for scalar or pseudoscalar @xmath155 mesons , @xmath156 , and for vector or axial - vector @xmath155 mesons , @xmath157 .",
    "we have tightened the @xmath104 requirement to @xmath158 since this is the kinematic limit for upper - vertex @xmath159 decays .",
    "the production of ground state and excited @xmath5 mesons from lower - vertex decays such as @xmath160 is expected to be suppressed .",
    "this is certainly true for @xmath161 decays where the fraction of @xmath5 produced at the lower - vertex is measured to be @xmath162  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence of @xmath52 production in the region @xmath163 where lower - vertex production is likely to occur ( see figure  [ fig : xp dist ] . )    with the assumption @xmath164 we can extract @xmath149 from the ratio of inclusive rates , @xmath165 many systematic errors cancel in the ratio . when computing the @xmath52 decay constant from the above equation , we use @xmath166 of the measured @xmath69 branching fraction to account for uncertainties in the upper and lower vertex contributions to @xmath52 .",
    "this accomodates the excess of @xmath69 candidates observed at low @xmath167 as seen in figure  [ fig : xp dist ] . from our upper limit on @xmath69 and",
    "cleo s  @xcite measurement of @xmath168 , we derive @xmath169 at the 90% c.l .",
    "the central value is @xmath170 , where the first error is due to the total error in the inclusive @xmath171 and @xmath69 branching fractions , and the second is the uncertainty in the non - factorizable and lower - vertex contributions to the @xmath69 decay rate . using the measured value of @xmath172 mev",
    "@xcite gives @xmath173 mev which corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath174 mev .",
    "this limit accomodates the prediction of @xmath175 mev by veseli and dunietz  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have searched for @xmath35 mesons decaying into the p - wave @xmath176 meson . the upper limit of @xmath177 at the 90% c.l .",
    "accounts for at most only a fraction of the total wrong - sign @xmath178 rate .",
