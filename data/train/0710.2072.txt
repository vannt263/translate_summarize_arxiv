    "we consider a second order elliptic equation with a rapidly oscillated coefficient @xmath0 : @xmath1 the equation appears to describe such problems as the stationary heat transfer in composite materials , the flow in non - homogeneous porous media as well as in many others .",
    "for the periodic coefficient , the averaging procedure is well known and is called the periodic homogenization @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the general non - periodic case is very important for practical applications ( e.g. in geoscience , petroleum engineering ) , and a vast literature exist discussing and comparing algorithms intended for averaging the permeability coefficient ( see the reviews @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "some algorithms are based on the idea that the effective ( averaged , upscaled , equivalent grid block ) permeability field in the whole domain can be determined by solving the flow problem locally @xcite .",
    "they vary in the choices of the local subdomain , the boundary conditions , and the ways to extract the effective permeability coefficient from the solution of the local problem .",
    "these algorithms usually perform well , and intuitively there should be arguments to justify their usage .",
    "an effective coefficient @xmath2 in the averaged problem @xmath3 is generally different from @xmath0 , and the solution @xmath4 is different from @xmath5 .",
    "therefore there is a trouble with perfect justification : the difference between these two solutions in some cases can be unacceptable .",
    "homogenization is known as a rigorous way to justify an averaging process .",
    "this is so because homogenization deals with sequences , not with single problems . and",
    "if the sequence of problems converges in some sense to a limit problem then , whatever strict requirements we have , there is always a set of problems from the sequence for which this limit can be considered as an averaged problem .",
    "although in practice we usually need to upscale a single problem like ( [ initial problem ] ) , not the whole sequence . nevertheless , if our initial problem ( [ initial problem ] ) belongs to the sequence in the homogenization process then the limit problem may be a reasonable candidate for upscaled initial problem , even if we can not improve the approximation .",
    "we only need that the sequence is homogeneous in the sense that all its members , including our initial problem , have something in common ( it is important to avoid situations when a convergent sequence contains an element which has nothing to do with the rest of the sequence ) .",
    "one way to do so is to use the sequence from locally periodic homogenization ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath6 where the function @xmath7 is a two - scale extension of the initial coefficient @xmath0 :    [ def two - scale extension ] let us say that a function @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9-periodic in the variable @xmath10 , is a two  scale extension for @xmath11 if there exists a positive number @xmath12 such that @xmath13    having a two - scale extension , we can choose a strictly positive sequence @xmath14 , containing @xmath12 , and consider ( [ sequence of problems ] ) with @xmath15 from @xmath16 as a sequence in the scope of locally periodic homogenization .",
    "the expressions for @xmath17 and corrections of @xmath4 can be found in the literature devoted to homogenization .",
    "all the members in the sequence ( [ sequence of problems ] ) have in common the function @xmath7 ; and at @xmath18 we recover the initial problem ( [ initial problem ] ) . in this sense",
    "a two - scale extension establishes a connection between ( [ averaged problem ] ) calculated from the homogenization algorithm , and the initial problem ( [ initial problem ] ) .",
    "as it was already mentioned , we can not claim that ( [ averaged problem ] ) with such @xmath2 is the averaged problem for ( [ initial problem ] ) .",
    "moreover , there are ( infinitely ) many two - scale extensions leading to different @xmath2 for the same @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that among them there could be classes of extensions appropriate for averaging .",
    "therefore it is interesting to test numerically the two - scale extensions from @xcite on several model problems with non - periodic coefficients . in each test",
    "we calculate both the solution @xmath5 and the ( corrected ) solution @xmath4 and verify whether the solutions are close to each other in any sense .",
    "such numerical evidence could give an idea about the areas of applicability ( if any ) of the approach .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section several ways to construct two  scale extension for arbitrary initial coefficients @xmath11 are presented . the section [ section averaging using two - scale extension ] contains cell problems and averaging algorithms from the homogenization theory .",
    "section [ section numerical results ] consists of numerical results in 1d for @xmath19 and @xmath20 extensions ( subsection [ 1d numerical tests ] ) , and @xmath21-extension in 2d ( subsection [ 2d numerical tests ] ) .",
    "the two - scale extensions ( which we numerically investigate in this article ) and their properties were presented and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the trivial extension is given by @xmath22 .",
    "more useful extensions can be constructed in the following way ( assuming that @xmath11 is known in a larger domain @xmath23 in order to avoid uncertainties close to @xmath24 ) :    * we choose @xmath25 ( small in comparison to the typical size of @xmath26 ) ; * for each @xmath27 we choose an @xmath12-cube @xmath28 with sides aligned with the coordinate axes , containing @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath31 is large enough : @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath28 is a cubic  representative elementary volume  around @xmath29 , @xmath12 is a size of averaging ) .",

    "@xmath47 is extended @xmath12-periodically in @xmath10 to the whole space @xmath48 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath49 is the two - scale extension .",
    "depending on the choice of @xmath28 we have @xmath19-extensions and @xmath34-extensions .",
    "the function @xmath7 is still a two - scale extension if we substitute the item 1 . above by one of the following more weak requirements :    * @xmath45 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a neighbourhood of @xmath29 ; * @xmath45 , @xmath52 ;    and let @xmath47 to be free in the rest of @xmath28 .",
    "this can be used to modify the coefficient near the boundary of @xmath28 e.g. if we want @xmath7 to be continuous .",
    "the second requirement is so weak that it allows to construct any two - scale extension satisfying def.[def two - scale extension ] ( without saying how to do it ) .",
    "probably we should have something like @xmath53 , @xmath54 not to loose the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath55 completely .",
    "anyway , we do nt consider these possibilities further in this paper .",
    "the @xmath34-extension depends on the choice of @xmath56 .",
    "if we are going to solve ( [ averaged problem ] ) using an unstructured grid then @xmath56 could be chosen related to that grid .",
    "for example , if we deal with fem then each @xmath38 could be a union of one or more finite elements . here",

    "we introduce a level @xmath262 which approximately separates the discretization steps @xmath263 into two groups : 1 ) resolving ( @xmath264 ) and 2 ) not resolving ( @xmath265 ) the initial coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath262 is a characteristic value , it is not uniquely defined .",
    "we can choose @xmath266 for the first 2d test ( subsection.[subsection mingyue am ] ) , and @xmath267 for the rest 4 tests ( subsection.[subsection random am ] ) .    when @xmath264 , @xmath208 is a monotone increasing ( with a constant rate ) function of @xmath177 . in the region",
    "@xmath265 , @xmath208 is nearly horizontal since the direct numerical methods fail to approximate well problems with rapidly oscillated coefficients until the coefficients are resolved ( such behaviour is not shown in our figures , except fig.[log10 e n=512 ] ) .",
    "@xmath209 , @xmath210 behave in a more complicated way .",
    "the upscaling is the most effective for coarse grids , @xmath268 , where @xmath209 , @xmath210 are monotone increasing ( with a constant rate ) functions of @xmath177 , almost coinsident to each other . to illustrate the choice of @xmath269 , we refer to fig.[ming yue test ] and fig.[log10 e n=512 ] , where @xmath270 and @xmath271 respectively .    when @xmath177 decreases further , @xmath272 , the accuracy of the approximation improves but with the slowing down rate .",
    "the averaging still makes sense , but it is less effective as before . in all cases except fig.[ming yue test ] , @xmath219 reaches a local minimum at some @xmath273 .",
    "further grid refinement in the averaging process gives deterioration in the accuracy .",
    "monotone is a desirable property for the accuracy vs. discretization size functions , but unfortunately it is unlikely to hold even for @xmath220 curve . @xmath209 and @xmath210 are almost the same for @xmath274 and start to deviate from each other for smaller @xmath177 .",
    "this happens since the increasing contrast of @xmath2 ( see fig.[contrast2 ] ) prevents the accurate solving of ( [ averaged problem ] ) on the @xmath177-grid .",
    "we observe that in the region of the resolved @xmath0 , @xmath219 comes close to @xmath228 ( with similar slope ) and possibly crosses it . for small enough @xmath177 ( @xmath275 ) and continuous @xmath0",
    ", the coefficient used in cell problems has a small variation .",
    "consequently the averaged coefficient @xmath2 can be seen as a perturbation of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , there is no surprise that ( [ initial problem ] ) , ( [ averaged problem ] ) after solving on the same @xmath177-grid by the same numerical method lead to similar results for @xmath276 .",
    "also , we note that it is intuitively better to apply a numerical method directly to @xmath0 than to its perturbation @xmath2 when the grid easily resolves the initial coefficient .",
    "this gives some explanation why the averaging algorithms rapidly improving at coarse @xmath177 have to slow down and to wait the direct method .",
    "similar behaviour is called  resonance  in the terminology of the multiscale finite element method @xcite .",
    "let us look how the curves change when @xmath0 becomes more and more oscillatory ( @xmath277 increases from @xmath278 in fig.[log10 e n=64 ] to @xmath245 in fig.[log10 e n=512 ] ) : 1 ) @xmath228 moves to the left ",
    "@xmath262 decreases ; 2 ) the region where the averaging is effective has a tendency to expand ",
    "@xmath269 , @xmath279 decrease ; 3 ) improving of the best accuracy which can be achived on coarse grids ( it can be roughly characterized by @xmath280 if the local minimum exists ) .    the quantity @xmath281 plotted in fig.[contrast2 ] for different @xmath12 and @xmath277 is related to the contrast of @xmath2 .",
    "the averaged coefficient @xmath2 is rapidly oscillated when @xmath12 is small , and @xmath282 when @xmath12 is large .",
    "in other words , @xmath283 even if @xmath284 and @xmath285 and @xmath286 are far from each other .",
    "this could be an indication of some statistical properties of our coefficients @xmath0 , possibly useful for reducing the computational cost of the averaging ( see the discussion of linear and sub - linear cost of upscaling algorithms in @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "in this article the averaging algorithm for the second order elliptic equation using @xmath19 and @xmath20 two - scale extensions was described in details and applied to several one and two dimensional model problems .",
    "our purpose was to show that there are non - periodic coefficients @xmath0 for which the standard periodic homogenization together with the two - scale extensions could provide reasonably good averaged coefficients . for the test cases we investigated how the quality of the approximation depends on the averaging size @xmath12 , and how the averaged approximations @xmath172 and @xmath195 perform against the direct numerical approximation ( without averaging ) @xmath213 .",
    "we need to mention that one can construct such initial coefficients @xmath0 for which the presented here averaging algorithm fails to approximate well on coarse grids . in these cases",
