    "theoretical models for pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stellar evolution are fundamental tools for learning about star and planet formation . but",
    "the accuracy of such models  especially at young ages  is unclear , due to our limited understanding of some complex physical effects like accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or magnetic fields and convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while such issues are being explored theoretically , robust observational constraints on key stellar parameters can be used to help guide improvements to the models .",
    "most important are dynamical constraints on stellar masses , @xmath5 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "usually these are determined from the orbital motions of binary systems @xcite , but they could increasingly be measured for _ single _ stars based on the rotation of their associated gas disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are interested in comparing the constraints from these two approaches , to illuminate and quantify any associated systematic problems in the inference of @xmath5 . to do that , we have targeted the few roughly equal - mass double - lined spectroscopic binaries that host circum - binary disks , including v4046 sgr @xcite and ak sco @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "excellent agreement ( to within @xmath61% ) is found between the estimates of @xmath5 from radial velocity monitoring of the stars and the tomographic reconstruction of the co gas velocity field in the disk .",
    "the confluence of these measurements also indicates that the disk and binary orbital planes are well - aligned ( within 12 ) .",
    "moreover , the predictions of theoretical pre - ms models faithfully reproduce these results for these two particular examples . however , these model successes are perhaps not surprising , since both v4046 sgr and ak sco are relatively old ( 10 and 18myr ) and massive ( 1.8 and 2.5@xmath7 in each system ) and the models should be more robust in that range of age and mass . an important supplementary test would employ a cooler and younger binary .    in those respects , dq  tau is an exemplary target .",
    "dq  tau is a roughly equal - mass double - lined spectroscopic binary with a period of @xmath616 days and a notably eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "it has a composite spectral type of @xmath6m0m1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is located in the nearby and relatively young taurus clouds .",
    "dq tau exhibits enhancements of various tracers of accretion and activity  optical brightening @xcite , emission line variations @xcite , and mm / radio emission @xcite  that have been associated with both pulsed accretion and reconnection events from colliding magnetospheres near peri - astron .",
    "the dq  tau binary hosts a circumbinary disk with substantial millimeter continuum emission from dust @xcite .",
    "there is recent evidence for molecular gas in rotation around the central binary host @xcite , although there is non - negligible contamination from the local molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we present new observations of molecular gas in the dq  tau circumbinary disk made with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , and use them to place a dynamical constraint on the total mass of the dq  tau binary .",
    "we also provide an updated orbital solution for the dq  tau binary based on long - term radial velocity monitoring .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] presents the data and its calibration .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] describes our modeling of the gas disk velocity field , provides an update of the original @xcite orbital solution , and highlights the key results .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses these results together and assesses the predictions of pre - ms evolution models .",
    "and section  [ sec : summary ] provides a summary in the contexts of other young circumbinary disk systems and the utility of the disk - based dynamical mass technique .",
    "alma observed the dq tau system on 2015 may 24 , using 34 of its 12 m antennas with separations ranging from 21 to 540 m . the observations were configured with the same spectral setup as in @xcite , employing the band 6 receivers to cover the co , @xmath8co , and c@xmath9o @xmath0=2@xmath11 transitions in 61 , 61 , and 122khz channels , respectively , as well as the adjacent continuum ( at 232ghz , or 1.3 mm ) .",
    "the nearby quasar j0510 + 1800 ( 6  separation ) was observed regularly to monitor variations in the complex gain response of the interferometer .",
    "the bright quasar j0423@xmath10120 was also observed to calibrate the bandpass behavior and absolute flux levels .",
    "the total on - source integration time was @xmath628 minutes .",
    "the visibilities were calibrated using standard techniques with the casa software package ( v4.3 ) . after a phase and amplitude self - calibration based on the bright continuum , the spectral line visibilities were time - averaged ( to 30s intervals ) and continuum - subtracted .",
    "images of the continuum and spectral line data were created by fourier inverting the calibrated visibilities ( assuming a briggs robust weighting parameter of 0.5 , to balance s / n and resolution ) , deconvolving with the clean algorithm , and restoring with a synthesized beam with fwhm = @xmath10 ( at p.a .",
    "the continuum image shows a bright , marginally resolved source with a peak intensity of @xmath668mjy beam@xmath11 and integrated flux density of 79mjy .",
    "the rms noise level is 70@xmath12jy beam@xmath11 ( the peak s / n is @xmath61000 ; the map sensitivity is clearly limited by dynamic range ) .",
    "all of this emission is expected to be from dust ; the peri - apse continuum enhancement noted by @xcite is not present at the observed orbital phase ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "but the focus here is on the emission from the co spectral lines .",
    "the @xmath14co ( hereafter co ) and @xmath8co @xmath0=2@xmath11 transitions were imaged in 0.1 km s@xmath11-wide channels , and reach an rms noise level of 8mjy beam@xmath11 in each channel . line emission from these transitions",
    "is detected over a @xmath67 km s@xmath11-wide velocity range , exhibiting the classical morphological pattern of keplerian rotation",
    ". the peak s / n is 35 for co , but only 7 for @xmath8co .",
    "both of these transitions show considerable contamination from the local molecular cloud material , affecting a 2 km s@xmath11-wide span slightly blueshifted from the systemic velocity .",
    "the c@xmath9o @xmath0=2@xmath11 transition was imaged in 0.2 km s@xmath11-wide channels , with an rms of @xmath64mjy beam@xmath11 in each , but the line is only marginally detected ( s / n@xmath63 ) in a few of these channels .",
    "given the line intensities , our focus will be on an interpretation of the co emission .",
    "the co channel maps are shown in the top portion of figure  [ fig : results ] .",
    "three sets of optical spectroscopic observations , including material also used by @xcite , were used to re - examine the orbital solution of the dq  tau binary .",
    "the first set consists of 30 spectra obtained at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) between 1984 and 2005 with two similar instruments equipped with intensified photon - counting reticon detectors , as described in more detail by the above authors .",
    "these spectrographs are no longer in operation .",
    "a subset of 23 of these spectra was used by @xcite ; we have reanalyzed all 30 of them here with improved techniques . these single - order spectra ( 45  centered around the b triplet near 5190 )",
    "have relatively low s / n , ranging from 6 to 16 per 8.5  @xmath15 resolution element .",
    "a second set of 22 observations consists of radial velocity differences measured from spectra also described by @xcite and collected with instruments at the lick observatory , the keck observatory , and the mcdonald observatory .",
    "finally , more recently ( 2013 october to december ) we obtained three additional spectra of dq  tau at the cfa for a different purpose , with the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the fred l.  whipple observatory on mount hopkins ( az ) .",
    "for this we used the bench - mounted tres instrument @xcite that delivers a resolving power of @xmath16 in 51 echelle orders spanning the wavelength range 39009100 .",
    "these three spectra have signal - to - noise ratios in the b region of 16 , 26 , and 23 per 6.8  @xmath15 resolution element .",

    "we have reported a new dynamical constraint on the mass of the young dq  tau binary made by reconstructing the velocity field of its circumbinary disk using alma observations of its co line emission , as well as an update on the binary orbital parameters based on a long - term optical spectroscopic monitoring campaign . in the following sections , we compare these constraints in more detail and discuss them in the context of pre - ms evolutionary model predictions and similar measurements for other equal - mass binary systems .",
    "the disk - based dynamical mass approach formally constrains the quantity @xmath81 by reconstructing the sky - projected keplerian velocity field of the gas disk .",
    "given some prior information on the distance and sufficient resolution to determine the aspect ratio of the emission ( @xmath33 ) , a precise estimate of @xmath32 can be made .",
    "this is not quite the case for dq  tau .",
    "the disk orbital plane is oriented such that it is viewed nearly in the plane of the sky , which concentrates most of the more spatially extended molecular line emission near the systemic velocity .",
    "that would be fine given our alma observations , except for the ambient molecular cloud material that also produces extended emission at those same velocities .",
    "taken together , the small projection factor and severe cloud contamination significantly expand the \\{@xmath32 , @xmath82 } degeneracy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] ) , limiting the precision of our dynamical mass constraint . for a conservative prior on @xmath40",
    ", we measure a joint constraint of @xmath83 , or individual measurements of @xmath50 and @xmath84 .    the orbital solution for a double - lined spectroscopic binary determines @xmath85 ( independent of @xmath40 ) from a fit to a time series of rv measurements .",
    "the updated solution presented here has @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ fig : triangle ] confirms that the alma disk - based and rv binary - based constraints are in good agreement ( well within 1@xmath4 ) in the binary mass  inclination plane .",
    "this suggests that these constraints can be combined together to yield some informative combined measurements for the system .",
    "if we assume that the binary and disk orbital planes are exactly aligned ( @xmath87 ) , the joint constraints from the rv and alma data indicate @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( this composite posterior is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] ) .",
    "if we consider the alma constraint on the quantity @xmath90 rather than marginalizing over the prior on @xmath40 , we can use the assumption of coplanarity and the rv data to estimate a dynamical distance to the system . in that case",
    ", we estimate @xmath91pc , which , although imprecise , has a most probable value slightly higher ( at the @xmath61@xmath4 level ) than standard measurements for the taurus star - forming region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our adopted prior , which may suggest a larger depth of the taurus complex . in the context of our nominal prior on @xmath40 , we can also use both datasets to instead infer a limit on the mutual inclination angle between the disk and binary orbital planes : we find that @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly , we note a small discrepancy between the systemic velocity in the barycentric frame derived from the disk ( @xmath93 ) and that derived from the binary orbit ( @xmath1724.52  @xmath19  0.33 @xmath15 ) .",
    "we speculate that this offset may be caused by veiling of the stellar photospheres , which results in a sub - optimal fit of the spectroscopic templates used for the radial velocity determinations .",
    "having demonstrated that independent dynamical constraints on @xmath32 for the dq  tau binary yield consistent results , it is of interest to make a comparison with the more common approach of estimating masses ( and ages ) from theoretical pre - ms evolutionary models .    a range of ( combined - light ) spectral types",
    "have been reported for dq  tau , with a general consensus around m0m1 .",
    "individual spectral diagnostics often skew towards earlier or later spectral types : for example , @xcite found that ratios of temperature sensitive lines suggest a k4k5 classification , while @xcite showed that many infrared molecular features ( e.g. , tio , feh , and h@xmath94o ) are better matched with a later type , m2.5m4.5 .",
    "some of this ambiguity may be due to the implicit assumption that both stars have identical photospheric properties .",
    "the improved orbital solution in sect .",
    "[ sec : orbit ] suggests otherwise : the inferred mass ratio ( @xmath95 ) indicates that the dq  tau stars have different temperatures and luminosities .    with that in mind",
    ", we explored a two - component fit to the @xmath96 photometry compiled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( previously presented by * ? ? ?",
    "observations in the @xmath97-band and at longer infrared wavelengths were excluded due to contamination by accretion activity and dust emission , respectively .",
    "the adopted model magnitudes were interpolated for a given \\{@xmath98 , @xmath24 } from the bt - settl synthetic photometry catalog @xcite for solar metallicity .",
    "these were adjusted for extinction using the @xcite reddening law ( with @xmath99 ) and scaled to account for a given luminosity ( assuming the same prior on @xmath40 as in sect .",
    "[ sec : disk ] ) .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that the effects of surface gravity are relatively small ( given the other uncertainties ) , so we fixed @xmath100 for both stars .",
    "each model therefore has five physical parameters , \\{@xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105}. we used an additional five nuisance parameters ( one per band ) to describe the  jitter \" ( dispersion ) in each photometric band due to variability ( presumed to be described by a gaussian with mean zero and this parametric description of the variance ) .",
    "the model quality for a given set of parameters was determined with a @xmath25 likelihood function and a reasonable set of priors . at each posterior draw , we calculated the implied mass ratio and imposed a gaussian prior with mean 0.93 and dispersion 0.05 , based on the rv orbital solution . since photometry alone is a poor diagnostic of @xmath98 ( especially for a composite dataset ) , we adopted a gaussian prior with mean of 3900k and dispersion of 250k on @xmath101 and @xmath103 and enforced the conditions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pms ] provides a summary of the modeling results .",
    "we find that the photometry prefers relatively low temperatures , @xmath108k and @xmath109k , and extinction , @xmath110 , yielding logarithmic luminosities @xmath111 of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "these are not particularly stringent constraints on the binary location in the hr diagram , of course , owing to the relatively ambiguous spectral classifications available for the individual components .",
    "based on the joint posterior distribution of \\{@xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 } , we followed the formalism of @xcite to derive component masses and ages \\{@xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 } from the predictions of pre - ms evolutionary models in the hr diagram , assuming that the binary stars are coeval .",
    "various incarnations of such models @xcite make consistent predictions within the ( considerable ) uncertainties , indicating a total binary mass of @xmath117 that is in good agreement with the dynamical constraints from the alma and rv data .",
    "the corresponding age predictions are considerably more uncertain ; favored values are in the 610myr range , although the permissible ages span from @xmath66 to 20myr ( 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "we note that this analysis is under the assumption of coevality of the two stars , which may not necessarily be true .",
    "additionally , the unusual nature of the dq  tau system ( e.g. , colliding magnetospheres during periastron ) may also invalidate our assumptions of normal pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "we have presented a set of new constraints on the fundamental properties of the dq  tau young binary system , based on alma observations of molecular line emission from its circumbinary disk and an updated analysis of optical spectroscopic measurements of its ( stellar ) radial velocity variations . for a conservative distance prior ( @xmath118pc ) , we find that the disk - based and binary - based _ dynamical _ constraints on the total stellar mass in the dq  tau system are in excellent agreement : their combined inputs suggest a total mass @xmath119 , and therefore individual component masses @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( incorporating the uncertainty on @xmath31 ) . moreover , we also find that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned within 3 , showing that the system is coplanar across radial distances from @xmath122au to 100au . in this system ,",
    "the dynamical mass precision is limited by an unfortunate combination of two factors : an orbital plane that is oriented nearly in the sky plane , and some large - scale contamination of the disk co spectral emission from the ambient molecular cloud . in the future ,",
    "an accurate parallax from _ gaia _ will help improve the precision of the disk - based estimate of @xmath32 .",
    "we also estimated the stellar mass in the system using the more common technique that compares the component locations in the hr diagram with predictions of theoretical pre - ms evolution models , and generally found good agreement .",
    "however , that approach has restricted utility given the lack of component - resolved photometry and substantial ambiguity on the effective temperatures .",
    "there is still much to be learned from this fascinating system ; our mass constraints lend some quantitative benchmarks that can be adopted in future studies .",
    "dq  tau is the third nearly - equal mass young binary system that has been analyzed with these two _ independent _ dynamical techniques to constrain stellar masses , the others being the older and earlier type systems v4046  sgr ( total mass @xmath123 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ak  sco ( total mass @xmath124 ; * ? ? ?",
    "using millimeter - wave interferometric measurements of their co spectral line emission , model fitting that reconstructs the keplerian velocity fields of their circumbinary disks finds dynamical masses that are in excellent agreement with constraints from optical rv monitoring of the host binaries ( thereby also implying that the binary and disk orbits are co - planar ) .",
    "granted , this is a small sample , but it does span an important range of system properties : e.g. , spectral types from early m to mid f , ages from a few to tens of myr , and orbital eccentricities from circular to @xmath125 . taken together , this work validates the quantitative _ accuracy _ of the disk - based dynamical inference of young star masses , provided that it is done carefully in a proper analysis framework . moving forward",
