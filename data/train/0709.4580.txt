    "size segregation is a characteristic feature of the moving granular media @xcite and it is important , as well as mixing , in industrial handling of granulated materials .",
    "a number of physical mechanisms were suggested to explain the segregation process @xcite .",
    "existing theories of continuous mechanics or statistical physics have only limited applications for description of granular media , and a unified theory encompassing all the granular phenomena is still missing @xcite . an ability to describe and predict the conduct of granulated materials is important for technological applications in industry where bulk materials are routinely handled . on the other hand ,",
    "granular media is an interesting object for theoretical studies because of its intricate phenomenology despite ostensibly simple purely mechanical nature .",
    "numerical simulations can provide a useful insight into the origins of various aspects of this behaviour .",
    "research data about the influence of the mechanical properties of granular matter to the segregation process is still scarce . besides",
    ", simplified models are commonly used : binary mixtures of particles are researched , binary collisions between the particles are assumed .",
    "experiments involving the particles with different mechanical properties are difficult to implement , but numerical simulations with different parameter sets can be performed easily , even though they are lengthy and require much computing power .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to investigate the mixing process inside granular material and the dependency of mixing on the properties of the particle material .",
    "most research performed in segregation of granular materials dealt with the situation when the researched material is put to motion by a moving bottom wall @xcite .",
    "we modelled a different setup where the material is stirred by a rectangular bar moving forward and backward in the horizontal direction and buried inside the material , which is a model of a simplified case of real equipment , such as forward or backward moving grates widely used in industry . mixing of granular material is sustained by periodic motion of a rectangular bar inside a rectangular container .",
    "we observe the segregation and stratification of particles by their sizes and intensity of mixing .",
    "a number of models have been applied for describing granular media with a varying degree of success @xcite .",

    "the contact forces act at the contact point .",
    "the colliding particles can slip with respect to each other in the tangential direction by the distance @xmath33 which is referred to as the integrated slip . as the particles slip , the value of @xmath34 increases until the tangential force exceeds the force caused by static friction , and after that , the tangential force component is defined by the dynamic friction .",
    "there is still no definite agreement what force model best describes the real interaction of the colliding particles @xcite .",
    "two most popular models of the normal forces arising between the colliding particles @xmath2 and @xmath6 are the hook s law and the hertz s law .",
    "these laws are expressed respectively as @xmath35 and @xmath36 it can be expected that the effect of a particular force model will be `` averaged out '' over the vast number of collisions during the process and the differences between these models will not have a significant effect on the statistical parameters of the granular matter . in order to verify this , we performed the simulations using both models and compared the results that will be presented below .",

    "the equations of motion ( [ eq : motion ] ) were integrated using the 6@xmath49-order gear predictor - corrector scheme @xcite . in order to reduce the amount of resources required for collision detection , the simulation area was partitioned into rectangular cells , with the length of the cell edge equal to the largest particle diameter . during each time iteration , initially all the particles were assigned to the corresponding cell according to their current coordinates ( verlet lists ) .",
    "it is evident that only the particles belonging to the same cell or the nearest neghbouring cells can collide ; thereby the number of pairwise collision tests can be reduced from @xmath50 to almost @xmath51 .",
    "the approach to characterization of mixing of particles in granular media stems from the theory of turbulence in fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the velocity of each particle @xmath3 can be split into its mean value @xmath52 and the fluctuating part @xmath53 : @xmath54 the mean velocity is defined by averaging the velocities of particles surrounding the given @xmath2-th particle within a certain preset volume : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the radius of the selected volume surrounding the @xmath2-th particle over which the averaging is carried out , @xmath1 is the position vector of the @xmath2-th particle , and a logical function @xmath57 is introduced for brevity : @xmath58 the fluctuating velocity shows how quickly the @xmath2-th particle changes its position with respect to the surrounding particles . by averaging @xmath59 and @xmath60 over the simulation volume ,",

    "particles whose radii are within the upper 20% of the total interval of the particle radii are considered `` large '' , and those with the radii within the lower 20% of the total interval are considered `` small '' , i.e. , the interval of radii of small particles is [ 0.005  m , 0.007  m ] , and that of the large particles [ 0.013  m , 0.015  m ] .",
    "the average vertical position of particles whose radii are in the interval @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 the changes of the average vertical position @xmath71 of `` small '' and `` large '' particles are compared to the change of the average vertical position of all the particles ( including large and small ones ) . however , as the stirring bar moves forward and backwards , the height of the volume occupied by the particles ( `` packed bed '' ) changes .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to introduce the average height of this volume @xmath72 and to normalize the vertical positions of the particles to this height , in order to discriminate the vertical motion of individual particles from the motion of the entire packed bed as a whole : @xmath73",
    "the simulated system consists of a rectangular box whose size is @xmath74  m@xmath75 containing @xmath76 spherical particles of various sizes with random distribution of particle depths for particles of different sizes , with radii ranging from 0.005  m to 0.015  m. at the lower left corner of the box , a rectangular moving bar is located whose width ( in the direction of the @xmath77 axis ) is equal to the width of the box ( fig .",

    "the time of motion of the bar from the leftmost to the rightmost position was usually @xmath80  sec , if not specified otherwise ; the time of backward motion is equal to the time of forward motion . the bar motion results in stirring of the particles and their redistribution in the volume of the box .",
