    "there have been several works investigating bipartite entanglement of non - zero thermal states of natural physical systems @xcite , and for many models , it is found that concurrence and logarithmic negativity of thermal states are nonzero at finite temperature .    however , there is no guarantee that such bipartite entanglement fully describes the properties of the qpt . in general",
    ", eigenstates are fully entangled in a _ multipartite",
    "_ manner . from the study of multipartite entanglement in quantum information",

    "the main obstacle is the difficulty in calculating many of the multipartite entanglement measures for large physical systems . due to this , one approach has been to consider multipartite entanglement witnesses , which are generally much more mathematically tractable ( see e.g. @xcite ) . this has given bounds on the minimum energy allowed for thermal states of the spin 1/2 ising model and xx heisenberg in a transverse magnetic field for example @xcite .",

    "we derive the threshold temperature of multipartite entanglement of the ground state measured by using a geometric measure @xcite and information of population of the ground state .",
    "this threshold temperature is an indicator to present how robust multipartite entanglement of the ground state is in the presence of thermal excitations .",

    ".    in general , evaluation of the robustness of entanglement is still a computationally difficult problem since it requires searching the mixed state @xmath21 over all the hilbert space .",

    "the reason of @xmath44 is that a bound of the robustness of entanglement to obtain the relationship   is too loose ( see appendix [ gappedttthm ] ) .",

    "we can see that the threshold temperature increases monotonically with the external magnetic field @xmath70 in the region of @xmath137 for @xmath142 .",
    "since a thermal state below the threshold temperature is guaranteed to be entangled , a thermal state of the xy model for @xmath137 is entangled even at high temperature , although the geometric measure of the ground state is monotonically decreasing in that region .",
    "it may be counterintuitive that such weak entanglement of the ground state can survive in a thermal state at high temperature .",
    "the high threshold temperature originates from the fact that the first energy gap between the ground energy and the first excited energy increases more rapidly than the rate of decrease of the geometric measure .",
    "thus weak entanglement of the ground state does not necessarily imply that it is easily destroyed by thermal excitations .",
    "we note that the high threshold temperature does not mean thermal effects can boost the amount of the entanglement .",
    "the ground state in the region of @xmath137 for @xmath142 is very close to a product state and the amount of entanglement is infinitesimally small but entanglement is thermally robust in a sense that it can survive until high temperature .",
    "in relatively artificial systems considered in quantum information , it has been found @xcite that a multipartite entangled state which is close to a product state can be useful as a universal resource for the measurement based quantum computation @xcite . in this case",
    ", the existence of infinitesimal entanglement provides a significant difference from zero - entanglement cases .",
    "also , a related approach on entanglement to that presented here provides an entanglement witness very closely linked to the threshold temperature which manifest themselves as physical observable in some spin systems @xcite .",
    "however , so far , we do not know whether such an infinitesimal amount but thermally robust entanglement can contribute to present any quantum property of natural physical systems at finite temperature .",
    "it is desirable to investigate physical properties at finite temperature related to entanglement of the ground state in the region of @xmath137 . on the other hand ,",
    "even if it would turn out that the infinitesimal amount of entanglement does not contribute to quantum properties at the limit of @xmath137 , it is interesting to investigate how multipartite entanglement at finite temperature contributes to quantum properties of the system in the trade - off of thermal robustness of entanglement and the amount of entanglement of the ground state in the intermediate region @xmath115 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied thermal robustness of multipartite entanglement of the ground state of the one - dimensional spin 1/2 xy model with a transverse magnetic field by using the threshold temperature introduced by @xcite .",
    "the threshold temperature is a temperature where the thermal state of a multipartite system is certainly entangled and its lower bound of the temperature can be obtained in terms of the geometric measure .",
    "we have calculated the geometric measure and threshold temperature in the spin 1/2 one dimensional xy model .",
    "we have analyzed the correspondence between the threshold temperature and the phase diagram at zero temperature by looking at the singularity of the threshold temperature .",
    "we have also analyzed thermal robustness of multipartite entanglement of the ground state .",
    "it has been shown that the c - line , on which two point correlation functions are constant and entanglement of the ground state takes local minimum with respect to parameters in the hamiltonian , is clearly reflected by the threshold temperature as well as the v - line ( the second order qpt line ) and the h - line ( the first order qpt line ) .",
    "although the geometric measure of the ground state itself does not reflect the c - line clearly , the c - line is enhanced by taking into account thermal excitations .",
    "we also present a region in the phase diagram where multipartite entanglement at zero temperature is high but is thermally fragile , and another region where multipartite entanglement at zero temperature is less but is thermally robust .",
    "these entanglement properties can not be deduced only from analyzing the ground state .",
    "they provide novel information of the quantum effects corresponding to qpt for natural physical systems at the non - zero temperature .",

    "we also note that it is possible to bound @xmath160 simply in terms of the gap @xmath47 , as was done in @xcite , however , in general this is not useful since it gives very low threshold temperatures , going to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
