    "ever since its isolation , graphene and graphene - related topics have attracted much attention from both theoretical and experimental condensed - matter communities.@xcite the monolayer of carbon atoms is light , transparent , flexible , strong and conductive , which makes it a perfect candidate for industrial applications .",
    "the appearance of these properties in the material are for a large part due to the assembly of the atoms in a honeycomb geometry , which consists of two interpenetrating triangular bravais lattices , referred to as sublattices @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the lattice symmetry together with time - reversal gives rise to the hallmark feature of the graphene system - pseudo - relativistic massless dirac fermions , which are low - energy quasiparticles close to the dirac points located at the two inequivalent , time - reversal conjugate @xmath2 and @xmath3 momenta at the corners of the brillouin zone ( bz ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the density of states linearly vanishes close to the dirac points .",
    "the semimetallic ground state is therefore protected against the effects of weak interactions , and an intrinsic superconducting state in half - filed graphene could thus only be possible for sufficiently strong attractive interactions.@xcite onsite attraction supports an @xmath4wave spin - singlet superconducting state,@xcite whereas nearest - neighbor attraction may lead to the formation of the kekule state , which breaks translational lattice symmetry and opens up a gap at the dirac points,@xcite while , at the same time , a gapless superconductor may also set in.@xcite therefore , it is of fundamental importance to address the competition of these two superconducting orders , and this is precisely the aim of the present paper .",
    "this problem is also important in light of the recent progress in inducing superconductivity in graphene via the proximity effect , by building a josephson junction,@xcite as well as by growing a graphene sheet on rhenium.@xcite    the fact that superconductivity is not an intrinsic property of graphene has led to the search for the dirac superconductor in materials with graphene - like properties .",
    "a recently proposed type of engineered dirac material consists of semiconducting nanocrystals with a truncated - cubic shape that self - assemble into a honeycomb superlattice.@xcite the motivation to build these materials was to study the electronic band structures that emerge when gapped , semiconducting systems are combined with features similar to those of graphene , by arranging the nanocrystals in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "these materials have been experimentally realized for rocksalt pbse and zinc - blende cdse nanocrystals , which form honeycomb superlattices with a lattice parameter @xmath5 nm via the attachment of the @xmath6 facet of the nanocrystal.@xcite the electronic band structure has been theoretically described for pbse , cdse , and hgte superlattices , and it has been predicted that they exhibit dirac cones in the conduction band above a wide gap enlarged by the quantum confinement.@xcite    here , we investigate whether phonon - driven superconductivity would be possible in artificial graphene samples made of pbse or cdse nanocrystals .",
    "we consider semiconducting sheets that are either free - standing or capped with lif , a dielectric which has been recently used to isolate and passivate nanocrystal layers.@xcite all of these systems are treated through an effective model where each nanocrystal is modelled as a superatom with a single effective @xmath7 orbital representing the lowest conduction state characterized by an @xmath7-envelope wavefunction .",
    "@xcite we consider only the electrons close to the dirac point .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the electrons couple to a single einstein phonon per superatom site , which corresponds to the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon for cdse , pbse , or lif . this particular model is considered because it can account for the features observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on cdse@xcite or pbse@xcite nanocrystals .    in the problem studied in this paper , the lo phonon couples to the effective @xmath7-electrons on the same site as well as on nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the electrons are described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , where the electron - phonon coupling includes both on - site and nearest - neighbor terms .",
    "we then integrate out the phonons to derive the effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "an estimate for this effective interaction is obtained based on a numerical analysis , and we find that for both pbse and cdse the effective interaction is repulsive , but can become attractive when the superlattice is capped by lif .",
    "the renormalized values for the attractive on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions that we find indicate that in these materials only on - site pairing should occur .",
    "nevertheless , we theoretically investigate the more intricate case when nearest - neighbor interactions dominate over the on - site one , with the aim of motivating further experimental search for graphene - like materials that could fulfill these conditions and exhibit the elusive kekul or hidden superconducting order described here .",
    "we consider both on - site and nearest - neighbor pairings , and the electron - electron interaction is then decoupled in these channels using mean - field approximation . in this setup",
    ", we consider the problem of the competition of the kekule and the hidden supeconductors at both finite temperature and finite chemical potential in the vicinity of the dirac points , and derive the gap equations for these order parameters .",
    "first , excluding the possibility of the coexistence of the two orders , based on these equations , we find the dependence of the critical ( more precisely , crossover ) temperature and the critical interaction on the chemical potential , and analytical solutions are obtained in the quantum - critical ( strong coupling ) and the bcs ( weak coupling ) limits , for both the kekule and the hidden order . according to our results ,",
    "the kekule order is preferred over the hidden order at both finite temperature and finite chemical potential .",
    "second , when we allow for the possibility of coexistence , based on self - consistent mean - field gap equations , we obtain that above a critical value of the attractive interaction a mixed phase sets in where the two superconducting orders in fact do coexist . we show that the critical value for its onset is greater than the critical coupling for the hidden superconducting state in absence of the kekule order .",
    "therefore , there is a region in the phase diagram where the kekule order is favored when competing with the hidden superconducting state .",
    "however , the latter eventually sets in and coexists with the kekule superconductor .",

    "the effect is stonger because it is characterized by higher dielectric constants than cdse .",
    "in fact , the effective interactions always remain repulsive due to the leakage of a large part of the electric field into the vacuum surrounding the superlattice when an electron is placed in a nanocrystal , implying that the dielectric screening from the ionic polarization is unable to overturn the initial repulsive interaction .",
