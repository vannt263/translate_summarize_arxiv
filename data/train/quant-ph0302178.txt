    "single - spin measurement is an extremely important challenge , and necessary for the future successful development of several recent spin - based proposals for quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite there are both direct and indirect single - spin measurement proposals .",
    "the idea behind some indirect proposals is to transform the problem of detecting a single spin into the task of measuring charge transport @xcite , since the ability to detect a single charge is now available . for direct single - spin detection ,",
    "magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) has been suggested @xcite as one of the most promising techniques . to date , the mrfm technique has been demonstrated with sensitivity to a few hundred spins @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how to read out the quantum state of a single spin using the mrfm technique based on cyclic adiabatic inversion ( cai ) .",
    "@xcite in this cai mrfm technique , the frequency of the spin inversion in the rotating frame is in resonance with the mechanical vibration of an ultra thin cantilever , allowing it to amplify the otherwise extremely weak force due to the spin .",
    "these amplified vibrations can then be detected by , e.g. , optical methods .",
    "previous studies @xcite of the dynamics of single - spin measurement by mrfm considered only the unitary evolution of the spin and the cantilever system , without including any effects of external environments or measurement devices . only recently",
    ", the effect of thermal noise environment on the dynamics of the spin - cantilever system in the mrfm was studied @xcite by using the caldeira - leggett master equation @xcite in the high - temperature limit .",
    "there is , however , a macroscopic device in the mrfm setup which measures the cantilever motion and hence provides information about the spin state . to our knowledge , the back - action of the measurement device and the effect of the thermal noise on the dynamics of the cantilever - spin system for the single - spin detection problem by mrfm have not yet been investigated systematically . in this paper , we include , in our analysis , a measurement device ( a fiber - optic interferometer ) to monitor the position of the cantilever .",
    "we consider various relevant sources of noise and calculate the signal - to - noise ratio of the output photocurrent of the measurement device .",
    "we also develop a realistic continuous measurement model , and discuss the approximations and conditions to achieve a quantum non - demolition measurement of a single spin by mrfm .",
    "finally , we present some simulation results of the dynamics of the single - spin measurement process .",
    "a schematic illustration of the mrfm setup is shown in fig [ fig : mrfm_setup ] . a uniform magnetic field , @xmath0 , points in the positive @xmath1-direction .",
    "a single spin is placed in front of the cantilever tip which can oscillate only in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "a ferromagnetic particle ( or small magnetic material ) mounted on the cantilever tip produces a non - uniform magnetic field or magnetic field gradient of @xmath2 on the single spin . as a result , a reactive force ( or interaction ) acts back on the magnetic cantilever tip in the @xmath1-direction from the single spin .",
    "the origin is chosen to be the equilibrium position of the cantilever tip without the presence of the spin .    in cai",
    ", the cantilever is driven at its resonance frequency to amplify the otherwise very small vibrational amplitude .",
    "this is achieved by a modulation scheme using the frequency modulation of a rotating radio - frequency ( rf ) magnetic field in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane . in this case , the rotating rf field can be represented as @xmath5t\\}$ ] , @xmath6 t\\}$ ] , where the frequency modulation @xmath7 is a periodic function in time with the resonant frequency @xmath8 of the cantilever . in the reference frame rotating with the @xmath9 , the spin - cantilever hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10\\sz -\\hbar\\omega_1\\sx - g\\mu\\left({{\\partial b_z}\\over{\\partial        z}}\\right)_0 \\z\\sz\\ ; , \\label{hsc}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the larmor and rabi frequencies , @xmath13 includes the uniform magnetic field @xmath0 and the magnetic field produced by the ferromagnetic particle , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath14-factor and the electron or nuclear magneton , and @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the cantilever in isolation ( i.e. , with no external magnetic field coupling it to the spin ) . for @xmath17 ,",
    "we arrive at an effective cantilever - spin hamiltonian of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will discuss in details the rotating picture and adiabatic approximation for the spin - cantilever system in the next section .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the basic principle of the single - spin measurement by cai mrfm . in the case",
    "when the adiabatic approximation is exact , the instantaneous eigenstates of the spin hamiltonian in the rotating frame of the @xmath9 field are the spin states parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the effective magnetic field @xmath22 , denoted as @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we define an operator @xmath24 for the component of spin along this axis .",
    "note that the initial spin state in the laboratory frame has the same expression as the initial state in the rotating frame .",
    "starting at a general initial spin state ( in the laboratory or rotating frame ) of @xmath25 in the @xmath26 representation , we can rewrite this initial state in the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath24 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the initial angle between the effective magnetic magnetic field and the @xmath1-axis direction .",
    "this implies @xmath30 = b_x^{\\rm eff}(t)/b_z^{\\rm eff}(t)=-\\varepsilon / f(t)$ ] .",
    "it then follows from the adiabatic theorem that the spin state at time @xmath31 can be written as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are instantaneous eigenvalues .",
    "so the probabilities of finding the spin to be in the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath23 are respectively @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 are time independent , the probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 remain the same at all times .",
    "this provides us with an opportunity to measure the initial spin state probabilities at later times .",
    "how do we measure these spin state probabilities ?",
    "the idea is to transfer the information of the spin state to the state of the driven cantilever . in the interaction picture in which the state is rotating with the instantaneous eigenstates of the spin hamiltonian",
    ", the spin - cantilever interaction can be written as @xmath38 $ ] . as a result ,",
    "the phase of the driven cantilever vibrations depends on the orientation of the spin states .",
    "suppose that the initial state is a product state of the cantilever and spin parts .",
    "at a later time , due to the interaction between them , the total state becomes entangled .",
    "monitoring the phase of the cantilever vibrations will give us the information about the spin .",
    "numerical simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : z_vs_t_phase ] with reasonable parameters for the cai approximations ) indicate that as the amplitude of the cantilever vibrations increases with time , the phase difference in the oscillations for the two different initial spin eigenstates of @xmath24 approaches @xmath39 . in other words ,",
    "the measurement of the single - spin states can be achieved by monitoring the phases of the cantilever vibrations at some later time @xmath31 .",
    "phase - sensitive , optical homodyne measurements of the cantilever vibrations can be performed using a fiber - optic interferometer .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a realistic and detailed analysis of the single - spin measurement scheme , including the effects of the measurement device and other relevant sources of noise .",
    "we assume an effective cantilever - spin hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : hsz ] ) where for the moment we let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be arbitrary , and @xmath42 is the hamiltonian given by ( [ eq : hz ] ) .",
    "it is useful to group this into three terms @xmath43 where @xmath44",
    "the state of the cantilever - spin system evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath45    in realistic cases , the spin part of the hamiltonian ( representing precession under the magnetic field ) gives an evolution which is very rapid compared to the reaction time of the cantilever .",
    "it therefore makes sense to switch to an interaction picture in which the state is rotating along with this precession .",
    "we do this by introducing a ( partial ) time translation operator @xmath46 : \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 indicates that the integral is to be taken in a time - ordered sense ; this unitary operator obeys the differential equation @xmath48    we then introduce the state @xmath49 in the _ rotating _ picture : @xmath50 with @xmath51 the solution of the original schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) at time @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath49 is @xmath52 \\ket{\\tilde\\psi(t ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & - \\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\h_z \\ket{\\tilde\\psi(t ) }    + \\frac{2 i \\eta}{\\hbar }    \\z \\left [ \\udag_s(t ) \\sz \\u_s(t ) \\right ] \\ket{\\tilde\\psi(t ) } \\;. \\label{rotating}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can define a _ locked spin _",
    "operator @xmath53 @xmath54 \\;;\\ ] ] in terms of this , the equation of motion for @xmath55 becomes @xmath56    unfortunately , it is difficult to get an exact solution for @xmath57 for a general function @xmath40 .",
    "this means that it is also difficult to derive an exact expression for @xmath53 , and the rotating picture ( [ rotating ] ) , while formally correct , is not very helpful .",
    "however , while we can not easily find an exact expression for @xmath57 for general @xmath40 , we can easily find an _ approximate _",
    "solution for a large class of functions .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is large and @xmath40 is slowly varying , so that @xmath58 for typical values of @xmath40 and @xmath59",
    ". then @xmath60 is also slowly varying , and if a spin begins in an _ instantaneous eigenstate _ of @xmath60 , it will remain close to an instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath60 for all times by the adiabatic theorem .",
    "the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath60 are @xmath61 where @xmath62 we use these instantaneous eigenvectors and eigenvalues to define an approximation to the unitary operator @xmath57 : @xmath63 with the accumulated phase @xmath64    note that @xmath65 obeys @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 which has the form of ( [ unitary_evolution ] ) plus some additional terms . from the definition ( [ eigensystem ] ) of @xmath68 ,",
    "we see @xmath69 provided that @xmath40 is slowly varying , the additional terms in ( [ unitary_evolution2 ] ) will be small .",
    "just as before , we can define a rotating picture , now using the unitary transformation @xmath70 , @xmath71 this gives us a new evolution equation for @xmath72 : @xmath73    \\ket{\\breve\\psi(t ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\id \\otimes \\biggl ( \\ket{v_+(0)}\\frac{d\\bra{v_+(t)}}{dt } \\e^{-i\\phi(t ) }    \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ket{v_-(0)}\\frac{d\\bra{v_-(t)}}{dt } \\e^{i\\phi(t ) } \\biggr )    \\u'_s(t ) \\ket{\\breve\\psi(t ) } \\;. \\label{rotating2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , it is helpful to introduce a new set of spin operators @xmath74 using the definition ( [ approx_unitary ] ) for @xmath70 , we can solve for the various terms in ( [ rotating2 ] ) : @xmath75 @xmath76 substituting ( [ spin_prime][osc_terms ] ) into ( [ rotating2 ] ) , we get @xmath77    note that this equation is still exact  it is equivalent to the original schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "however , we can see that if @xmath78 are large , then @xmath65 will be a rapidly growing function , and the last two terms of equation ( [ rotating3 ] ) will oscillate very rapidly compared to the first two terms . over a short period relative to the response time of the cantilever",
    "they will essentially average away to nothing . in this limit , therefore , we can reasonably make a rotating - wave approximation , to get the approximate evolution equation @xmath79 this is equivalent to making an exact adiabatic approximation , as described in section 2 .",
    "we can see how this approximation compares to the complete hamiltonian for a reasonable set of parameter values in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "this set of parameters was chosen to match those of berman et al .",
    "@xcite , as was the set of times plotted in figure 3 .",
    "comparison shows that our results match their unitary simulations to good precision . for the rest of this paper we will be using the rotating wave approximation , and representing states in the rotating frame . for simplicity",
    ", we henceforth omit the accent from the state @xmath72 .    in this rotating - wave approximation , if the spin begins in an instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath60 , it will remain in an instantaneous eigenstate at all times .",
    "if it begins in a superposition of the two eigenstates , the spin and cantilever degrees of freedom will become entangled , with the two components of the wavefunction corresponding to the two spin directions remaining undisturbed for all times .",
    "monitoring the position of the cantilever then serves as a nondemolition measurement of the spin , as we would wish .",
    "note that the corrections to the adiabatic approximation include terms which can flip the spin .",
    "these terms must remain small for the system to be a true nondemolition measurement .",
    "the result of the spin measurement manifests itself as a @xmath39 phase shift in the oscillation of the cantilever .",
    "we can see this in figure 4 .",
    "unfortunately , in practice we can not treat the cantilever as an isolated system .",
    "it is coupled at least weakly to the vibrational modes of the bulk , and is therefore subject to dissipation and thermal noise . since the cantilever can be treated as a single harmonic oscillator , we can model the effects of this thermal bath by the well - known caldeira - leggett @xcite master equation in the high - temperature limit : @xmath80    - \\frac{i\\gamma_m}{\\hbar } [ \\z,\\{\\p,\\rho\\ } ]    - \\frac{\\gamma_m}{2\\ell^2 } [ \\z,[\\z,\\rho ] ] \\ ; , \\label{caldleggeqn}\\ ] ] where the parameters are @xmath81 @xmath82 is the cantilever mass , @xmath83 is the temperature , @xmath84 is boltzmann s constant ( or the equivalent for our system of units ) , and @xmath85 is the strength of the coupling to the thermal bath",
    ". we can interpret @xmath86 ( with units of inverse time ) as the dissipation rate and @xmath87 ( with units of length ) as the thermal de  broglie wavelength .",
    "a feature of this equation is that it does nt necessarily preserve the positivity of @xmath88 on short time scales ( though at long times it is well - behaved ) @xcite .",
    "this arises because of the approximations which are made in the derivation , which become invalid at very short times .",
    "while this may be physically unimportant , it can be inconvenient ; in particular , if we wish to _ unravel _ the evolution into a stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite ( as we will in section 6 ) , it is necessary to start with a master equation in _",
    "lindblad form _ , @xcite @xmath89    + \\sum_j \\left [ 2 \\l_j \\rho \\ldag_j - \\{\\ldag_j\\l_j,\\rho\\ } \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{lindbladeqn}\\ ] ] for some hermitian @xmath90 and set of general _ lindblad operators _ @xmath91 .",
    "the caldeira - leggett equation ( [ caldleggeqn ] ) is not of this form , which is why it can violate positivity of @xmath88 .",
    "the exact quantum brownian motion master equation was shown @xcite not to have the lindblad form , but rather requires time - dependent coefficients to ensure the positivity of the density matrix at short times . however , by keeping more terms from the high- or medium - temperature - limit expansion in a consistent way , disi @xcite has shown that the caldeira - leggett equation can be replaced by another master equation which _ is _ of lindblad form , and which agrees with it except at very short times when the equation s validity is questionable in any case .",
    "this is done by adding a term to ( [ caldleggeqn ] ) of the form @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "the procedure is analogous to completing the square .",
    "if we choose the ansatz @xmath93 with real @xmath94 , plug it into the equation ( [ lindbladeqn ] ) , and equate it to the caldeira - leggett equation ( [ caldleggeqn ] ) plus the additional term , we get @xmath95    - a^2 [ \\z,[\\z,\\rho ] ] - b^2 [ \\p,[\\p,\\rho ] ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + i ab ( - 2\\z\\rho\\p + \\z\\p\\rho + \\rho\\z\\p    + 2\\p\\rho\\z - \\p\\z\\rho - \\rho\\p\\z ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -(i/\\hbar)[\\h_{sz}(t),\\rho ]    - \\frac{\\gamma_m}{2\\ell^2 } [ \\z,[\\z,\\rho ] ]    - \\frac{\\gamma_m\\ell^2}{2\\hbar^2 } [ \\p,[\\p,\\rho ] ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{i\\gamma_m}{\\hbar } ( \\p\\rho\\z - \\z\\p\\rho -\\z\\rho\\p + \\rho\\p\\z ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath96 so the lindblad operator for this equation is @xmath97 and the effective hamiltonian , going to the rotating picture and making use of the approximation derived in section 3 , is @xmath98 in order for the cantilever to be an effective measurement device , the loss rate must be very low : @xmath99 .",
    "in order to serve as a measurement scheme , we must have some way of _ monitoring _ the motion of the cantilever .",
    "because of the microscopic scale of the motion , this is not so easily done .",
    "one approach is to use optical interferometry to measure the cantilever position .    as shown in figure 1 , the cantilever forms one side of an optical microcavity and the cleaved end of the fiber forms the other side . as the cantilever moves , the resonant frequency of the cavity changes .",
    "because the timescale of the cantilever s motion is very long compared to the optical timescale , we can treat the effects of this in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the cavity mode is also subject to driving by an external laser , and has a very high loss rate .",
    "the full master equation @xcite for the cantilever - spin - cavity system in the interaction picture is @xmath100    + 2\\l\\rho\\ldag",

    "suppose now that we perform homodyne measurement @xcite on the light which escapes from the cavity .",

    "it is for this reason that the stochastic master equation is therefore often referred to as an _ unraveling _ of the average master equation .    for numerical purposes , it is often much easier to solve an equation for a _ pure state vector _ rather than a density matrix @xcite .",

    "we have simulated this system using the c++ quantum state diffusion library @xcite to numerically solve both the unitary evolution with hamiltonian ( [ rotating_approx ] ) and the stochastic equation ( [ qsd ] ) .",

    "the value of @xmath165 above then corresponds to a temperature of around @xmath166 , which is within the bounds of experimental feasibility , though rather lower than the temperatures used in current experiments ( around 3k ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath167 , the value of @xmath168 corresponds to a field gradient of about @xmath169 , which is higher than current experiments by roughly two orders of magnitude @xcite , but hopefully this too will improve with time .",
    "the cantilever would undergo displacements of about a nanometer .",
    "alternatively , rather than increasing the field gradient we could achieve similar numbers by lowering the spring constant of the cantilever , for instance by shrinking the mass of the cantilever . lowering the mass by a factor of 100 has the same relative effect on @xmath168 as increasing the field gradient by a factor of ten .    we then might ask about realistic parameters for the monitoring .",
    "a typical cavity size @xmath170 is about a micrometer , with a laser frequency of @xmath171 .",
    "this cavity is generally quite lossy ; reasonable quality factors might be in the range @xmath17210100 .",

    "in arbitrary units , this gives coefficients @xmath178 the first value is the multiplier in ( [ icz ] ) ; the second gives the equilibrium displacement of the cantilever ; the third is the coefficient of the lindblad operator @xmath179 .",
    "one question we can now easily address is how quickly the state of the spin collapses onto eigenstates of @xmath24 . in figure 5 we plot @xmath180 for ten different trajectories .",
    "we see that in all ten cases the spin converged to @xmath181 quite quickly , before @xmath182 .",
    "if we compare this to the results of figure 4 , we see that the spin state collapses rather more quickly than the cantilever oscillations can respond .",
    "we only get a clear output signal when the two phases are well separated , which does not occur until nearly @xmath183 .",
    "generically , the difficulty of collapsing the spin state is much less than the difficulty of obtaining an unequivocal readout .",
    "the curves depicted in figure 4 are idealized , without the measurement noise which will always be present in the output current ( [ ic ] ) or ( [ icz ] ) . in figure 6",
