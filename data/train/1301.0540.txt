    "young nuclear star clusters have now been found surrounding supermassive black holes in a number of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the best studied young nuclear cluster is at the center of our own milky way galaxy , located only 8 kpc away and surrounding a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of mass m@xmath3 m@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the young stars are located within 1 pc of the smbh and are thought to have formed as recently as 4 - 8 myr ago @xcite .",
    "the origin of the young stars , in such close proximity to the supermassive black hole , is puzzling , given that the strong tidal forces in this region will shear apart typical molecular clouds before they can collapse to form stars .",
    "thus , the young nuclear cluster ( ync ) is a key laboratory for understanding whether and how stars form under such extreme conditions .",
    "the ync at the galactic center has several observed properties that may help to determine its origin .",
    "to date , more than 100 young stars have been spectroscopically identified as ob supergiants , wolf - rayet stars , and , more recently , ob main - sequence stars @xcite . the young population appears to fall into three dynamical categories ; ( 1 ) a well - defined clockwise rotating disk ranging from 0.03 pc to at least 0.5 pc with moderate eccentricities , ( 2 ) an off - the - disk population in a more isotropic distribution over the same distances and also with moderate eccentricities , and ( 3 ) @xmath410% cluster within 0.03 pc of the black hole with high eccentricities of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these kinematic differences have led to some speculation that the young stars may have been formed in multiple episodes , although the outer two groups ( # 1 and # 2 ) have consistent stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the inner group ( # 3 ) was most likely dynamically injected , since the smbh s tidal forces are too strong to permit star formation at these close distances .",
    "initial theories suggested that this inner population was substantially older , as long times were needed to scatter inward a large number of binary systems that can interact with the smbh and leave behind a star on a highly eccentric orbit with a small semi - major axis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , more recent inclusion of additional dynamical effects suggests that the stars in the central region can be brought in more efficiently than initially thought @xcite .",
    "thus , it remains uncertain whether the inner group of young stars was originally part of the outer groups and born in the same star formation event . in the outer groups , there is some observational support for a possible warp in the clockwise disk @xcite , a second face - on disk made of counter - clockwise rotating stars @xcite , and for sub - clusters of stars both on and off the disk @xcite , although the statistical significance of these results is still debated @xcite .",
    "the total surface density profile of the young stars in the plane of the sky is @xmath6 @xcite and substantially steeper in the disk plane @xmath7 .",
    "early analysis of the bright stars ( k@xmath813 ) gave an age for the cluster of 6 @xmath9 2 myr based on the presence of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and the proportions of wr stars to o stars @xcite .",
    "in this same work , the observed number of wr and o stars and their luminosity function suggested that the the total cluster mass is @xmath10 m@xmath2and the initial mass function ( imf , @xmath11 ) is top - heavy with a slope significantly flatter than ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath12 ) . however , these results were limited by the lack of sensitivity to less massive , main - sequence stars ( k@xmath1313 , m@xmath1420 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "deeper spectroscopic studies initially showed that the luminosity function for the young stars appears to have a sharp turn - over at k@xmath1513.5 , suggesting that the present - day mass function is extremely top - heavy with a slope of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a top - heavy imf is also supported by the chandra x - ray observations of the region , given that lower mass young stars should still be coronally active and emitting copious x - rays that are nt detected @xcite .",
    "several possible models for the origin of the young stars have been proposed and the two presently supported by observations include ( 1 ) formation _ in situ _ in a massive self - gravitating molecular disk @xcite or ( 2 ) disruption of an in - falling massive cluster formed much further away @xcite . _ in situ _ formation models invoke the build - up of a gas disk surrounding the smbh that reached a critical mass ( @xmath17 m@xmath2 ) approximately 6 myr ago such that local self - gravity within the disk became sufficient to overcome the tidal shear , the disk collapsed along the vertical direction and formed stars @xcite .",
    "if such a disk was built up slowly , the gas and resulting young stars would largely be on circular orbits , which does not appear to be the case observationally @xcite .",
    "modified _ in situ _ formation models include the rapid infall of a single massive molecular cloud or the collision of two in - falling clouds to produce non - circular orbits and the on - disk and off - disk populations @xcite .",
    "the surface density of stars formed _ in situ _ in a slowly - built gas disk may be steep ( @xmath18 ) ; however , the surface density resulting from a cloud - cloud collision is less well constrained . for in - falling cluster scenarios ,",
    "the young stars are formed a few parsecs away in a massive young star cluster that spirals in via dynamical friction and disrupts in the central parsec @xcite . in order for such a cluster to migrate into the central parsec within only a few million years",
    ", the cluster must be very massive and centrally concentrated and perhaps even host an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) at its center @xcite .",
    "such a scenario would produce the on - disk population and a flatter surface density profile ( @xmath19 ) , with the off - disk population resulting from subsequent dynamical perturbations @xcite .",
    "_ in situ _",
    "formation models are favored based on the density profiles and available time scales ; however , no single model completely explains all of the observed properties .",
    "one important prediction of current _ in situ _ formation models is that the initial mass function should be very top - heavy due to the extreme temperatures , pressures , densities , and ambient radiation fields present in the central parsec @xcite .",
    "however , a number of model parameters are still very uncertain ( e.g. gas infall rate , temperature , pressure , and cooling time ) and a wide variety of initial mass functions are still possible .",
    "the initial mass function , age , and mass of the young nuclear star cluster at the galactic center is of particular interest both for understanding the origin of the young stars and exploring star formation under extreme conditions .",
    "past observations of a turn - over in the near - infrared luminosity function and the low total x - ray emission apparently support a top - heavy imf .",
    "however , new observations presented in our companion paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) , show a luminosity function that does not turn over , but continues to rise ; warranting a new analysis of the mass function .    in this work , we compare the near - infrared photometry of the spectroscopically identified young stars in paper i to models of star clusters in order to determine the age , mass function , and total mass of the young nuclear star cluster . details on the observational sample and measurements are presented in  [ sec : obs_and_analysis ] .",
    "synthetic clusters are generated using stellar evolution and atmosphere models to produce individual stars as they would appear at the galactic center in  [ sec : synthetic_clusters ] . in ",
    "[ sec : bayesian_methodology ] we present a bayesian inference method for fitting the observed data with synthetic clusters to determine the cluster s properties and uncertainties .",
    "results in  [ sec : results ] show that the present - day mass function is slightly flatter than a salpeter imf and rule out a mass function as top - heavy as previously claimed .",
    "we also find a younger age and our modeling requires the inclusion of binaries and multiple star systems to adequately fit the luminosity function .",
    "observations and data used in this paper are described in .",
    "our data sample includes all stars with a non - zero probability of being a young , early - type star ( @xmath20 ) . for each star ,",
    "the measurements consist of a kp magnitude corrected for differential extinction ( k@xmath21 ) , a kp uncertainty ( @xmath22 ) , the probability of youth ( @xmath23 ) , and an indicator for whether the star is a wolf - rayet star . only stars with k@xmath24",
    "are included .",
    "the modeling presented in this work utilizes these individual measurements rather than a binned kp luminosity function ( klf ) .",
    "however for illustrative purposes , figure [ fig : klf ] shows our binned klf compared with a model klf for a cluster with an age of 6 myr , extinction of a@xmath25 , distance of 8 kpc , and an imf slope of @xmath26 , consistent with previously published best - fit cluster parameters @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between our observed klf and this model motivates the work presented below as we attempt to derive new best - fit cluster parameters and uncertainties .    in our sample ,",
    "we have chosen to include young stars at all radii , including the central 08 region immediately around the supermassive black hole .",
    "there are some suggestions that the stars in this central region were not formed in the most recent starburst , but rather in an earlier event .",
    "the brightest early - type star in this region , s0 - 2 , is a b0-b2.5 v star with an age of less than 15 myr based on its measured temperature , gravity , and luminosity @xcite .",
    "the other early - type stars in this region have spectral features consistent with main - sequence stars @xcite and the oldest age for a main - sequence star at kp@xmath1515.5 ( a@xmath25 , d@xmath158 kpc ) is less than 20 myr .",
    "given these age constraints and the large uncertainties in the theoretical scattering efficiencies , it remains plausible that the young stars in the central region of our sample are the same age as the stars at larger radii .",
    "furthermore , as described in , including or discarding the stars within a radius of 08 does not significantly change the shape of the klf .    .",
    "a model klf is shown for published best - fitting cluster parameters ( _ blue _ ) with an imf slope of @xmath26 , age of 6 myr , and a distance of 8 kpc @xcite .",
    "for comparison , a model klf is also shown for a similar cluster with a salpeter imf slope of @xmath12 ( _ green _ ) . ]",
    "while the early - type stellar population in the central parsec of the galaxy can be divided into several different kinematic sub - groups @xcite , it is not yet clear whether these sub - groups have different origins , or whether all the young stars formed from the same starburst and were differentiated via subsequent dynamical processes . therefore , we choose to analyze the entire population of young stars as a single starburst cluster and to estimate the cluster s mass function , age , and total mass .",
    "the traditional approach to deriving a mass function would be to construct a binned klf from the observed kp magnitudes , assume a distance and extinction , and use a mass - luminosity relation from models of stellar evolution and atmospheres to convert from observed magnitudes to initial stellar masses .",
    "this approach has several shortcomings , including arbitrarily choosing bin sizes , neglecting uncertainties on stellar brightness , not accounting for multiple systems , and correlations in the cluster age , mass , and imf @xcite .",
    "more recent and rigorous statistical methods , particularly those using bayesian inference , provide flexibility and produce robust estimates of the most probable cluster parameters and their uncertainties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have developed a bayesian inference methodology for deriving the physical properties of an observed young star cluster using simulations of synthetic clusters .",
    "the process of simulating a synthetic young cluster is described in  [ sec : synthetic_clusters ] and the full bayesian methodology , implementation , and testing is described in  [ sec : bayesian_methodology ] ,  [ sec : multinest ] , and ",
    "[ sec : test_sim_clusters ] , respectively .",
    "readers wishing to skip the detailed description of the modeling may proceed to  [ sec : results ] where the resulting best - fit cluster properties and uncertainties are presented .",
    "model young star clusters are produced assuming an instantaneous starburst at time @xmath27 , at distance @xmath28 , with an observed cluster mass @xmath29 .",
    "the initial mass function of the cluster is described as a single power - law given by the probability density function @xmath30 \\\\ & = & \\frac{m^{-\\alpha}}{\\ln m_{max } - \\ln m_{min } } \\quad [ \\alpha = 1]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is allowed to vary and has the value @xmath12 in the case of a typical imf for the high - mass end of a solar - neighborhood population @xcite .",
    "in addition to these free parameters , a number of fixed parameters are also needed to fully model the cluster .",
    "first , the extinction is fixed to a@xmath25 as we will compare to observations that have been corrected for differential extinction to this value .",
    "the metallicity is fixed to z=0.02 , which is roughly solar .",
    "observations suggest the young gc population is consistent with solar iron abundance ; but may be as high as 2@xmath32 solar and seems enhanced in @xmath31-elements @xcite . the choice to keep metallicity fixed to solar is also motivated by the lack of complete stellar evolution and atmosphere models at other metallicities and abundance ratios .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses possible uncertainties associated with restricting our analysis to solar metallicity .",
    "the range of masses we consider is set as @xmath33 = 1 m@xmath2and @xmath34 = 150 m@xmath2and is kept fixed throughout the analysis .",
    "this is justified as our observations do not include stars below 10 m@xmath2due to sensitivity limits and stars above 150 m@xmath2have already exploded for clusters older than 3 myr .",
    "thus the currently observed stars have no power to constrain the low or high mass cutoffs and a more expansive mass range would not impact our results . for each star drawn from the imf , we must also consider whether it has companions @xcite .",
    "high mass stars in the galactic disk are known to have a high multiplicity fraction , perhaps even 100% @xcite and the multiplicity fraction and the companion star fraction , which is the mean number of companions per primary , are dependent on the mass of the primary star in the multiple system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic center cluster is modeled allowing multiple systems with a mass - dependent multiplicity fraction ( mf ) and companion star fraction ( csf ) .",
    "the functional form of how the mf and csf vary with primary mass is still very uncertain even for solar - neighborhood young clusters .",
    "we empirically derive this relation by compiling mf and csf measurements in young clusters from the literature and assuming that the mf and csf follow a power law distribution ( see appendix [ sec : multiplicity ] for the derivation ) . each star drawn from the imf with mass @xmath35",
    "is determined to be in a multiple system and assigned a number of companions based on @xmath36 the mass of the companion stars is drawn from a power law probability distribution on the mass ratio , @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the lowest allowed mass ratio is @xmath40 .",
    "our choice of @xmath41 is consistent with observations of local massive stars in young ob associations , although values ranging from @xmath42 would also be within 68% confidence intervals allowed by observations @xcite .",
    "luminosity functions are hardly impacted by this choice of @xmath43 since lower mass ratios do not significantly increase the total system luminosity @xcite .",
    "allowing for multiple systems will have the largest effect at the bright end of the luminosity function where magnitude bins that were un - populated by individual stars are filled in with multiple star systems composed of massive , bright primaries and companions @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : test_sim_clusters ] , simulated clusters are used to show that incorporating multiple systems is essential and that failing to include them produces poor fits and incorrect ages and imf slopes . for a cluster with a desired cluster mass of @xmath29 ,",
    "stars are simulated until the sum of all stellar masses , including companions , exceeds @xmath29 and then the last simulated star is thrown out if that would bring the synthesized cluster mass closer to the desired @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "a complete list of free and fixed parameters we use to produce synthetic star clusters is presented in table [ tab : model_parameters ] .",
    "conversion from stellar masses to synthetic photometry requires the use of stellar evolution and atmosphere models . at the suspected age of the young cluster ( 4@xmath448 myr ) , stars with masses in excess of 30 - 60 m@xmath2are evolving off the main - sequence and stellar evolution models with rotation are found to best describe populations of blue supergiants and wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "we use the grid of geneva models with an initial rotation speed of 300 km / s provided by @xcite , which only extends down to 9 m@xmath2 . in these models , wolf - rayet stars",
    "are identified using the criteria suggested in @xcite : @xmath45 k and the mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface is @xmath46 . to extend to lower masses along the main sequence and",
    "also capture pre - main sequence evolution at younger ages , the geneva grid is merged with the grid of models provided by @xcite that extends up to 7 m@xmath2 . for both grids ,",
    "a suite of isochrones is generated at logarithmic ages of @xmath47 with steps of @xmath48 and each isochrone samples mass more finely than @xmath49 m@xmath2 .",
    "the two isochrones are then merged and interpolated over the gap between the two models ( 7 - 9 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "an example of the merging process for @xmath50 is shown in figure [ fig : merge_evo_models ] .",
    "the resulting isochrones provide a mapping from the simulated stellar masses to their luminosities ( @xmath51 ) , effective temperatures ( @xmath52 ) and surface gravities ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the physical parameters for each star are converted into observable brightness at kp - band using model stellar atmospheres .",

    "all downloaded atmosphere models were re - formatted to work with the _ pysynphot _ python package in order to perform interpolations within each grid and generate synthetic spectra at specific temperatures , metallicities , and gravities .",
    "the synthetic spectra are flux calibrated to what would be observed at earth without extinction by multiplying by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the radius of the star and @xmath28 is the distance",
    ". then the synthetic spectra are reddened using the galactic center extinction law from @xcite and convolved with transmission profiles for a typical mauna kea atmosphere and for the kp filter in nirc2 .",
    "the final synthetic spectra are integrated using _",

    "an example mass - kp magnitude relation is shown in figure [ fig : klf_vs_multiples ] ( left panel ) and would predict that s0 - 2 , with a kp@xmath60 after correcting to a@xmath25 , would have a mass of @xmath418 m@xmath2 , which is consistent with previous estimates based on the effective temperature and surface gravity derived from detail spectral analysis @xcite .",

    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars require special consideration as their atmospheres are windy and clumpy .",
    "models of stellar evolution for wr stars can predict when stars enter and exit the wr phase , surface abundances , and the luminosities and temperatures at the base of the atmosphere .",
    "however , this is insufficient to uniquely define what will be observed due to differences in wind velocities , mass loss rates , and clumping factors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "put another way , there is no unique mass - magnitude relationship for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "model atmospheres do exist for wolf - rayet stars ; but they require observations of the wind velocities and mass - loss rates and still do not uniquely predict the interior properties of the star , such as temperature and gravity at the base of the atmosphere @xcite .",

    "bayesian techniques are beginning to be used more widely in the study of all types of star clusters @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here differs from previous work in several ways .",
    "first , single - band photometric information is combined with some spectroscopic information that identify which stars are wolf - rayet stars . in our case , only single band photometry is necessary since extinction maps are available from past multi - band photometry @xcite .",
    "second , the initial mass function is assumed to have the functional form of a truncated power - law , although other functional forms can easily be inserted .",
    "this differs from some bayesian treatments that attempt to derive the masses of the individual stars allowing for infinite variation in the shape of the mass function @xcite .",
    "third , we allow for mass - dependent multiplicity fractions and high - order multiple systems , which are important at the high mass end of the mass function . fourth , we include all candidate young stars and weight them by their probability of youth in order to use all available information and accurately account for incompleteness .",
    "finally , instead of using markov chain monte carlo techniques to perform the bayesian inference , we find that better solutions result from nested sampling techniques @xcite .",
    "this bayesian approach provides detailed probability distributions for the mass function slope and other cluster parameters given limited observations .",
    "it also avoids traditional biases from binning and neglecting photometric errors and accounts for stochastic sampling of stellar masses .",
    "our full methodology is described below in more detail .",
    "we start at the beginning , with bayes equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the observed data , @xmath73 is the model , @xmath74 is the likelihood of observing the data given some model , @xmath75 captures the prior knowledge on the model parameters , and @xmath76 is a normalizing factor known as the evidence . the likelihood function and the prior distributions",
    "then give posterior probability distributions for the model parameters , @xmath77 .",
    "the model , @xmath73 , is defined by the set of free and fixed parameters given in table [ tab : model_parameters ] .",

    "the wr stars are separated out and only the observed number of wr stars , @xmath78 , is included in our analysis , since the initial masses of wr stars can not be determined based on their luminosity alone .",
    "for all the other non - wr stars , measurements of the kp brightness and error are used along with the probability that each star is young , @xmath23 . although we observe @xmath79 non - wr stars , not all of them are young .",
    "we estimate the number of young ob stars , @xmath80 , as the sum of the observed non - wr stars , weighted by their probability of youth : @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting measurements that make up the data are then @xmath82\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the set of @xmath84 measurements for the @xmath79 non - wolf rayet stars observed .",
    "the likelihood function is composed of three independent probabilities : ( 1 ) the likelihood of observing the set of kp magnitudes , @xmath85 , and uncertainties , @xmath86 , which effectively captures the shape of the klf ; ( 2 ) the likelihood of observing @xmath80 ob stars , which captures the normalization of the klf ; and ( 3 ) the likelihood of observing @xmath78 wolf - rayet stars : @xmath87 to derive the first term , we use an unbinned approach such that the likelihood is the multiplication of the individual stars probabilities , weighted by the probability of youth , @xmath88 the probability for a star to have some kp , @xmath89 , is given by the probability distribution derived from synthetically `` observing '' a simulated young cluster .",

    "the resulting kp photometry from the simulated stars in the model cluster are binned finely ( 0.1 mag bins ) to produce a probability distribution for the intrinsic kp luminosities . for small numbers of stars",
    ", stochastic sampling effects can lead to an inaccurate estimate of the probability distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize accuracy and reduce the total number of clusters that need to be simulated , all model young clusters are simulated with a total mass of @xmath91 m@xmath2 .",
    "the shape of the kp luminosity function does not change with cluster mass and the number of wolf - rayet and non - wolf - rayet stars simply scales linearly with total cluster mass . the intrinsic probability distribution for kp luminosities is multiplied by the imaging completeness curve , @xmath92 , truncated at kp@xmath1515.5 to match the data , and normalized to give the final probability distribution , @xmath93",
    "finally , the measured photometric error is incorporated by modeling the observed magnitude as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting probability of observing @xmath97 for a given star is then given by @xmath98 which is the convolution of the model klf and the error probability distribution .",
    "the resulting probabilities for each star feed into equation [ eqn : likelihood_obs ] to calculate the first term of the total likelihood in equation [ eqn : likelihood ] . in the second and third terms of the likelihood ,",
    "the number of ob and wr stars scales linearly with the mass of the young cluster , which was verified with simulations .",
    "thus the same simulated young clusters used to produce @xmath99 also give the expected number of wr and ob stars after scaling linearly with cluster mass , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the expectation values ( means ) for the number of wr and non - wr stars , respectively .",
    "the likelihood of observing @xmath78 and @xmath80 are then taken as a poisson distributions @xmath103      the resulting posterior probability distribution for the model parameters can not be calculated analytically .",
    "traditionally , monte carlo techniques are used to produce a representative sample of points from the posterior probability distribution .",
    "the most commonly used method is the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "however , mcmc methods may have difficulty converging or fully mapping probability space when the probability distributions that are being sampled are multi - modal or highly degenerate and curved .",
    "an alternative method is nested sampling @xcite such as in the publicly available multi - modal nested sampling code , _",
    "http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/[multinest ] _ @xcite .",

    "* ) and is less computationally expensive and more accurate , in some cases , than mcmc methods .",
    "we performed tests on simulated clusters using traditional mcmc techniques using both metropolis - hastings and hit - and - run step methods ( http://code.google.com/p/pymc/[pymc package ] ) and compared the overall computation time and accuracy with the multinest code .",

    "are necessary to determine whether the observed imf slope and younger age can give rise to the observed high eccentricities in such a short time .    ultimately , a complete spectroscopic and astrometric census of the young population in the young nuclear cluster is required to accurately measure the recent star formation history and determine if the distinct kinematic components were formed under different conditions , resulting in different mass functions .",
    "expanding the survey area with current facilities will help clarify whether young stars on and off the disk have a different imf .",
    "the bayesian methodology presented here should be expanded to incorporate additional information from spectroscopy , such as effective temperature and gravity constraints for the ob stars , surface - abundance sub - types for the wolf - rayet stars , and luminosities / temperatures from wolf - rayet wind / atmosphere modeling such as presented in @xcite .",

    "complete multiplicity surveys of _ young _ clusters ( @xmath1410 myr ) that span a large range of primary stellar masses ( 0.1 @xmath44 @xmath128 m@xmath2 ) , mass ratios , and separations are difficult to conduct and only a few exist in the literature @xcite .",
