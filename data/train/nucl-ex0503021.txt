    "spallation reactions , i.e. proton - induced reactions on heavy targets at a few hundred mev , have been the subject of many studies since 1950 .",
    "they are known to be a valuable tool for the study of the de - excitation of hot nuclei because , contrarily to reactions between heavy ions , they lead to the formation of hot prefragments with only a limited excitation of the collective degrees of freedom such as rotation or compression . their study has also been motivated by astrophysics , as cosmic rays undergo spallation reactions with the hydrogen and helium nuclei of the interstellar medium .",
    "recently , progresses in high - power accelerator technologies have made possible the realisation of intense neutron sources based on spallation reactions .",
    "such sources are needed for accelerator - driven systems  @xcite , and also find applications in nuclear physics  @xcite and for material physics and biology  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spallation reactions can also be used to produce exotic nuclei and , hence , secondary beams  @xcite .",
    "those new applications have motivated a large number of experimental works and created a strong demand for high - precision calculation codes .    in order to bring new data and therefore new constraints for the codes , measurements of reaction residues",
    "have been undertaken at gsi by an international collaboration .",
    "these experiments are based on the inverse - kinematics method .",
    "fragments are identified in - flight using the frs spectrometer  @xcite , making possible the first measurements of complete nuclide distributions . in the frame of those studies , production cross sections",
    "have already been published for several systems : au+p at 800a  mev  @xcite , pb+p at 1a  gev  @xcite , pb+d at 1a  gev  @xcite , u+p at 1a  gev  @xcite and u+d at 1a  gev@xcite .",
    "these results have helped to partially discriminate between the respective influence of the two main steps of the spallation process , the intranuclear cascade and the fission / evaporation process .",
    "the behavior of several codes ( the isabel  @xcite , incl4  @xcite or bric  @xcite intranuclear cascades , the abla fission / evaporation code  @xcite ) has proved to be now overall satisfactory for proton energies around 1 gev . on the other hand , important failures in the description of the emission of charged particles in the dresner evaporation code  @xcite have been put in evidence  @xcite . in the 1 gev energy region ,",
    "the only serious , remaining deficiency is the underestimation of the lightest evaporation products , which are related to the most violent collisions . despite large differences in the description of the spallation process , all the codes mentioned above present this weakness .",
    "this indicates that some phenomena have not been taken into account . in recent experiments conducted at gsi on lighter nuclei ( @xmath1fe , @xmath2xe ) ,",
    "our collaboration explored a range of nuclear temperatures higher than in the systems mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "indications were found that fast break - up decay may play an important role in high - energy spallation reactions  @xcite .",
    "the question of understanding of the evolution of the reaction mechanisms with decreasing energy also remains open .",
    "this is an important point in the perspective of technical applications , because nuclear reactions in thick targets happen in a broad energy range : beam particles are subject to electronic slowing down , and also fast particles emitted in the first stage of the reactions are likely to produce additional nuclear reactions , giving rise to an _ internuclear _ cascade . to address the question of the dependance of the reaction on the energy of the incident particle",
    ", an experiment has been performed at gsi aiming at measuring production cross sections of residues in the spallation of lead by protons at 500a  mev .    the present paper deals with the experimental results on the fragmentation - evaporation residues obtained in this experiment .",
    "it completes the results already published obtained during the same experiment for the fission products  @xcite .",
    "detailed confrontations between the results from codes dedicated to the description of the spallation process and these data as well as other data on evaporation residues obtained by our group and other related measurements on spallation reactions like light particle production are postponed to a forthcoming paper .",
    "the energy chosen for this experiment , which is low in comparison to the frs standards for experiments involving nuclei as heavy as lead  @xcite , was a source of difficulties for the identification of the fragments in the spectrometer .",
    "the modified setting and the analysis methods developed for this experiment have been presented in a dedicated paper  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly recall their main features in section  [ chap : setup ] .",
    "we will then discuss in section  [ chap : secondary ] the influence of multiple reactions taking place in the liquid hydrogen target and modifying the observed fragment production , and the method which has been employed to remove their contribution . in section  [ chap : kinematics ] we will present the results on the reaction kinematics . finally , in section  [ chap : results ] we will present the production cross sections .",
    "the gsi synchrotron ( sis ) was used to produce a 500a  mev @xmath3pb pulsed beam with a pulse duration of 4 seconds and a repetition time of 8 seconds .",
    "the beam was sent onto a 87.3  mg/@xmath4  liquid hydrogen target  @xcite located at the entrance of the fragment separator ( frs ) .",
    "the target window consisted of two 9  mg/@xmath4  ti foils on each side .",
    "the beam intensity was monitored during all the experiment by a beam - intensity monitor  @xcite . in order to maximise the proportion of fully stripped fragments in the spectrometer , a 60  mg/@xmath4  nb foil was placed after the target .     and",

    "the rigidity of the fragments in each of the two magnetic sections is given by :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the magnetic field , @xmath8 the curvature radius of the fragment trajectory , @xmath9 the mass number , @xmath10 the ionic charge of the fragment , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lorentz relativistic coefficients .",
    "the presence of @xmath10 in equation  [ eqn : brho ] is a critical point , as a large part of the fragments produced at the energy of 500a  mev chosen for this experiment were not fully stripped .    in order to measure the nuclear charge ( @xmath13 ) of the fragment , 4 multi - sampling ionisation chambers ( music ;",
    "see  @xcite for complete description ) were placed at the exit of the spectrometer , each one filled with 2 bar of p10 gas mixture ( 90% ar , 10% ch@xmath14 ) .",
    "the total gas thickness was 800  mg/@xmath4 , with the measurement of the energy loss effectively performed only in some 2/3 of the length of each chamber . using such a large gas thickness was necessary in order to maximise the charge exchanges ( electron pick - up and stripping ) of the fragment in the gas , thus washing out the influence of the incoming ionic charge state of the fragment on the energy loss , and ensuring that the latter represents the nuclear charge of the fragment with sufficient resolution  @xcite .",
    "the obtained resolution , @xmath15z_(fwhm)_/z , ranged between 0.6% for the lightest fragments and 0.9% for the heaviest .",
    "the horizontal position of the fragments at the intermediate and final focal planes ( respectively @xmath16  and @xmath5 ; see figure  [ fig : frs ] ) was measured using 3  mm thick plastic scintillators .",
    "the signals of these detectors were also used to measure the time of flight of the fragments in the second part of the spectrometer .",
    "the @xmath17  ratio of the fragment was deduced from the combination of these measurements , according to equation  [ eqn : brho ] .",
    "the thick aluminium degrader ( 1700  mg/@xmath4 ) located at the intermediate focal plane ( @xmath16 ) was used as a passive energy - loss measurement device . as the energy loss",
    "can be related to the variation of the magnetic rigidity and the ionic charge states in the two magnetic sections , the latter may thus be deduced from the energy loss as obtained from the nuclear - charge identification and the velocity measurement  @xcite .",
    "the resolution obtained in this measurement was not sufficient to discriminate the ionic charge states on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the only information obtained was the charge - state changing between the first and the second part of the spectrometer , an integer value that we will note @xmath18 . besides",
    ", the evaluation of the variation of magnetic rigidity was also used to reject fragments that underwent a nuclear reaction at @xmath16 .",
    "the mass of each fragment was determined assuming that its number of electrons in the frs was the minimum required by its @xmath18 value  @xcite .",
    "the production rate for each nuclide was then calculated by constructing its full velocity distribution in the first part of the frs , using formula  [ eqn : brho ] . for many nuclides ,",
    "the momentum width was larger than the momentum acceptance of the frs ( @xmath19 ) ; in this case several settings of the magnets were used in order to cover the full momentum distribution of the fragment . due to the hypothesis made on the ionic charge state",
    ", some fragments were misidentified ; the corresponding correction factor for the production rates was deduced from ionic charge - state probabilities calculated using the code global  @xcite .",
    "the above procedure was performed separately for each group of fragments characterised by a given @xmath18 value .",
    "the probability of each @xmath18 value was then deduced from the scaling factor necessary for all isotopic distributions obtained for a given element to match with each other .",
    "the obtained values were found to be in good agreement with the global calculations ( discrepancies lower than 10% for the most abundant ionic charge - state combinations , and less than 20% for other combinations )  @xcite .",
    "the production rates were corrected for the losses in the different layers of matter located in the path of the fragments after the target area ( degrader , plastic scintillators , music chambers ) .",
    "the total reaction cross sections were calculated using the karol optical - model - based code  @xcite .",
    "losses were found to be of the order of 30% , including reactions in the music chambers ( the latter being characterised by signals of first and last chambers being improperly correlated ) .",
    "the reaction rates in the different layers of matter are presented in table  [ table : reac_prob ] .",
    "the dead time of the acquisition and the detector efficiencies were also taken into account .",
    "fragment losses due to limited angular acceptance of the frs were found to be negligible .",
    "all the measurements and the analysis procedure above were repeated with an empty target , and the resulting production rates were subtracted from the total production rates .",
    "finally , the production cross sections were obtained by normalising the production rates to the number of atoms in the liquid hydrogen target , which had been measured in a previous experiment , and to the beam intensity .",
    ".reaction probabilities of the beam ( @xmath20 at @xmath21 at the entrance of the frs ) in the various layers of matter of the frs beam line .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have estimated the total production cross - section of evaporation residues by summing all the measured residue cross sections , obtaining a value of ( 1.44@xmath220.21 )  b. our measurement does not strictly cover all the range of the possible residues .",
    "however , the nuclides for which we have no measurement are mostly the lightest fragmentation products . considering the steepness of the mass curve in this region ( see figure  [ fig : cs_mass ] ) , we can assume that the contribution of these nuclides is small , and probably much smaller than the error bars .",
    "adding the fission cross - section for this reaction  @xcite we estimated the total cross section to ( 1.67 @xmath22 0.23 ) b.    this value is very close to the 1.70  b found by a glauber - type calculation performed with updated density distributions .",
    "on table  [ tab : total_cs ] we compare those values with the ones obtained in the reactions pb+p and pb+d at 1a  gev .",
    "although the slight decrease of the total cross section with respect to 1a  gev measurements is in agreement with the expected trend , the 500a  mev fission cross section is higher than previous measurements conducted at this energy , and also higher than the systematics of prokofiev  @xcite .",
    "this question has been discussed in detail in the corresponding paper  @xcite .",
    "let us only underline that the agreement of a well - established model with our experimental total cross section comes in support of our measurement .      in recent years",
    ", a large number of measurements of spallation residues have been performed by the team of r. michel .",
    "of special relevance to our work is the measurement of residues of spallation of natural lead by protons at 550  mev published by gloris _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite . cross sections with independent yields ( _ i.e. _ nuclides that are not produced by @xmath11 decay ) can be compared directly , while cross sections corresponding to accumulation of @xmath11-decaying nuclei require a summation of our data along the decay chain .",

    "calculations of the ratio between production cross sections at 550 and 500 mev have been performed in two systems : with the same @xmath3pb target nuclei ( continuous line ) and with a different nucleus , @xmath24pb ( dashed line ) , in order to study the effect of the use of natural lead in the gloris experiment ( see text).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the ratio between our data and those of gloris _",
    "_  are presented in figure  [ fig : chemistry ] . in the case of the cumulated yields , cross sections measured at gsi",
    "have been summed along the decay chain in order to be comparable with the radiochemical measurements .",
    "the agreement between the two data sets is overall fair for heavy residues , although a systematic shift of roughly 10% may be guessed . considering the error bars , all the measurements seem to be compatible , with the exception of @xmath25pb and @xmath26tl .",
    "as we have already underlined , our data points are very consistent with respect to one another .",
    "this makes such a large error in our measurement for these two nuclides rather unlikely , since it should have been clearly visible on our isotopic distributions .    for lighter nuclei",
    "the ratio decreases rapidly with increasing mass loss with respect to the projectile .",
    "this effect is the direct consequence of the differences between the measured systems : the 10% higher energy strongly favors the production of lighter residues , up to a factor of 3 for mass losses around 35 nucleons .",
    "this statement can be checked by using monte - carlo calculations . for this purpose",
    "we used the isabel  @xcite intranuclear cascade and the abla  @xcite evaporation code .",
    "although one of the purposes of these measurements is precisely to check the validity of those codes in the few hundreds of mev region , we can assume that they are reliable enough if one only wants to calculate variations in a very limited energy and mass range , as it is the case here .",
    "results of the calculation of the ratio between isobaric cross sections for the two systems are also represented in figure  [ fig : chemistry ] .",
    "a calculation that only takes into account the different incident energies offers a satisfactory reproduction of the decrease of the ratio for the light fragments .",
    "replacing @xmath3pb by @xmath24pb ( in order to mock the isotopic mixing of natural lead of which the targets of gloris experiment were made ) leads to a slight reduction of the calculated ratio for light nuclides , which improves the agreement with the data in this mass range . for heavy nuclides",
    "the calculations indicate that results at 500a  mev should be larger than at 550a  mev , which is not what we observed for most of the points .",
    "however , only 3 points are not compatible with the calculations when one considers the error bars .",

    "each spectrum has a nearly constant value . in this mass range ,",
    "the lower the incident energy , the higher the cross sections . with increasing mass losses ,",
    "the cross sections start to decrease . here , the lower the energy , the earlier and the steeper the fall .",
    "this is easily understood as the direct consequence of the exploration by the prefragment of all the possible range of excitation energy available in each system . in this respect",
    ", the measurement with deuterons gives insights about what would be obtained in a measurement conducted with protons at twice the energy .",
    "the shape of the mass - loss curve obtained from the measurement on gold is fully compatible with the tendencies observed for lead .    in the 500a  mev experiment , a clear separation exists between the group of the evaporation products ( which does not extend beyond mass losses of 40 mass units ) and the group of the fission product ( which starts around mass losses of 70  @xcite ) .",
    "this absence of mixing could also be demonstrated by studying the velocity spectra of the light fragments , which all exhibit a quasi - perfect gaussian shape , while the presence of fission products would have introduced a characteristic double - bumped shape due to the forward - backward selection of the fission fragments by the frs  @xcite .       and",

    "right figure : isotopic charge - pickup cross sections at 3 energies as a function of the mass loss with respect to the heavy partner of the reaction.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    an especially interesting result of this experiment is the measurement of the production cross section of 15 isotopes of bi ( see figure  [ fig : pickup ] ) . those nuclides are formed by charge - pickup reactions . in the energy range considered here , the capture of the incident proton is not initially possible , as the incident proton energy is well above the fermi energy of the target nuclide .",
    "therefore the formation of @xmath27bi is improbable , and the formation of @xmath3bi is only possible via , either the formation of a resonant state ( @xmath15 and pions ) , or a quasi - elastic collision between the incident proton and a neutron from the target nuclide , in which the neutrons leaves with an energy very close to the initial energy of the proton .",
    "the cross section for the charge - pickup is one of the few data that bring direct constraints for the intranuclear - cascade codes .    in the left part of figure  [ fig : pickup ]",
    "we compare our measurement of the total charge - pickup cross section to previous measurements performed by our collaboration  @xcite , waddington _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and binns _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite . for a qualitative discussion we do not need to discriminate between gold and lead as those nuclides are close to one another , both in atomic number and mass .",
    "our measurement confirms the trend of a strong increase of the total cross section of the charge - pickup with decreasing energy .",
    "this increase of the bi production in pb+p experiments concerns all bi isotopes , as it can be seen in the right part of figure  [ fig : pickup ] .",
    "the shapes of the 500a  mev and 1a  gev distributions are overall similar , but the overproduction at 500a  mev increases slowly from a factor of 2 for the heaviest isotopes to a factor of 4 for the lightest .",
    "problems in the separation of the ionic charge states  @xcite prevented us to use the kinematic spectra to distinguish between the respective contribution of the @xmath15 resonance and the quasi - elastic reactions in the formation of the heaviest bi isotopes , as it was done by keli _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the shape of the hg spectrum ( obtained in the au+p at 800a  mev measurement ) is slightly different from the lead spectra . on one hand , for mass losses up to 7 mass units ,",
    "the shape of the isotopic distribution is nearly identical to the pb spectra , with values in - between the two pb experiments , which is consistent with a smooth evolution as a function of the projectile energy . on the other hand the production of the lightest isotopes decreases faster than in the pb+p experiments .",
    "this difference in shape can be explained by the lower coulomb barrier and the shorter distance from the residue corridor  @xcite for hg nuclides with respect to bi nuclides , which favor the emission of protons by the excited prefragments  @xcite .          in figure  [",
    "fig : cs_isobaric ] the data from the same experiments as in previous sections are plotted as isobaric spectra .    for heavy fragments , all distributions issued from reactions of pb with p or d are very similar , both in shape and in magnitude .",
    "low - energy reactions slightly dominate the cross sections for masses down to 185 . with decreasing masses ,",
    "the isobaric spectra behave in accordance with the mass distributions : the spectra for the highest - energy reaction scale down very slowly , whereas this scaling is steeper and steeper when one considers reactions at decreasing incident energy .",
    "however , for each isobar , the shapes of the different spectra remains extremely similar , as does its centroid ( this can be seen in the left part of figure  [ fig : cs_means ] ) .",
    "data from the reactions of pb on the dummy target ( which consists mainly of ti in the target itself and nb for the stripper foil placed after the target ) at 500a  mev have been added to the figure  [ fig : cs_isobaric ] in order to illustrate the so - called limiting - fragmentation regime  @xcite .",
    "we observe no difference of shape or centroid between the spectra issued from the reaction on heavy ions and from the reaction on hydrogen isotopes .",
    "the gold data offer an interesting point of comparison with the lead data .",
    "the gold fragments with mass close to 197 are associated with rather cold reactions and have therefore kept a @xmath28 ratio very close to the initial system , while pb fragments close to the same mass have lost roughly 10 nucleons , mostly neutrons because of the hindrance of charged - particle emission due to the coulomb barrier .",
    "therefore the gold and lead residue spectra are strongly shifted with respect to one another .",
    "this shift slowly vanishes with the increasing mass loss , which is easily understood as the slow move of the gold fragment distributions towards the residue corridor  @xcite .",
    "this corridor is clearly visible on the left part of figure  [ fig : cs_means ] : the barycenter of the isobaric distributions of the residues of all reactions converge on the same line .",
    "this universal behavior , well known for reactions between heavy ions , is here demonstrated to be valid in a very broad energy range , even for fragments which are at the very end of the mass distribution . in other words ,",
    "the isobaric distributions are independent of the incident energy in the system studied if properly renormalized .",
    "this is an experimental proof that the factorisation hypothesis is valid at energies as low as a few hundreds of mev .",
    "this further strengthens the discussion regarding the agreement between epax and the data obtained from proton - induced reactions in systems in which fission does not play a major role ( section  [ chap : secondary ] ) .",
    "conversely , various projectile energies lead to variations of the center of the residues isotopic distributions , as it can be seen on the right part of the figure  [ fig : cs_means ] as a deviation of the average mass value of the residues produced at 500a mev . if this effect is washed out by the slow variations of the mass curve for higher energy reactions , it becomes noticeable at lower energies when the fall of the mass distribution becomes so steep that the production of the most neutron - deficient isotopes is strongly inhibited .",
    "therefore , the reproduction of the isotopic and elemental cross - sections using a scaling factor between different systems is not appropriate at energies below the fragmentation limit .",
    "the production cross sections and the momentum distributions have been measured for about 250 nuclei formed in the reaction of @xmath3pb on protons at 500a  mev , covering most of the nuclides created down to a mass loss of 40 units with respect to the projectile , and with cross sections as low as 5  @xmath29b .",
    "the reaction products were identified in - flight in atomic number and mass - over - ionic - charge using the frs spectrometer .",
    "the large proportion of non - fully stripped ions in the spectrometer was accounted for in detail , thus allowing to calculate the production cross section for each nuclide . the contribution of multiple reactions in the target to the residue production was carefully subtracted .",
    "the production cross sections are in good agreement with previous radiochemical measurements .",
    "the isobaric distributions of the production cross sections are found to be very close to the ones measured at higher energies , thus extending the validity range of the factorisation hypothesis to energies of a few hundreds of mev .",
    "the large variations observed on the isotopic cross sections can be nearly fully ascribed to the variations of the residue distributions with mass - loss at decreasing energy .",
    "kinematical data are consistent with previous measurements .",
    "the data obtained in this experiment , combined with previous measurements performed with the same technique ( especially in the same system at 1a  gev ) , constitute a set of information that is highly relevant for the development of reliable nuclear - reaction codes and , thus , the design of ads .",

    "in this appendix we demonstrate the relation  [ eqn : secondary ] .",
    "let us consider a target of thickness @xmath31 .",
    "at any point @xmath32 in this target , a nucleus @xmath33 can be produced by a nuclear reaction with a nucleus of the target , either from a beam nucleus or from a previously formed nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , an already formed @xmath33 nucleus can be destroyed .",
    "formally , this can be written as :      @xmath35 represents the cross section associated to the transformation of a nuclei @xmath36 in a nuclei @xmath37 , @xmath38 represents the total reaction cross section of a nuclide @xmath39 , and @xmath40 labels correspond to the beam . in this calculation",
    "we assume that the variations of the cross sections related to the slowing down of the nuclei in the target are small enough to be neglected .",
    "the choice of the intermediate nuclei involved in the third term of the equation has been explained in section  [ chap : secondary ] .                    in the situation considered here ,",
    "the products @xmath47 are always smaller than 0.1 ( the total reaction probability in the target ) .",
    "we are then allowed to expand the exponentials , which leads to a simplified form of equation  [ eqn : secrec ] :      we have written the production rates of fragments @xmath33 as @xmath49 .",
    "this form is convenient because , knowing all the production cross sections from nuclide having a mass larger than the one from @xmath33 and the production rate of @xmath33 , one can directly calculate the cross section for @xmath33 .",
    "this system can now be solved by iterations over each isobar , starting from the mass of the projectile , providing one can calculate the various @xmath30 terms .        c. d. bowman _",
