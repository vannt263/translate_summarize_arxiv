    "major progress has been made in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution since the discovery of a significant population of submm / mm - bright , dusty galaxies .",
    "the first handful of galaxies , discovered behind lensing clusters @xcite , and in the hubble deep field @xcite , revealed the diversity of the population .",
    "scuba @xcite , the innovative camera with which smgs were first seen , was commissioned on the james clerk maxwell telescope during 19967 . since then , the 117-bolometer , 1200-@xmath0 m mambo camera @xcite has been installed on the iram 30-m telescope , spain .",
    "surveys at 1200@xmath0 m are sensitive to the same dusty galaxies as scuba , yet with a selection function that potentially stretches to higher redshifts and is sensitive to lower dust temperatures @xcite .    a moderate fraction of smgs can be pinpointed by their @xmath0jy - level emission at 1.4ghz ( ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) , allowing us to identify their counterparts in other wavebands .",
    "however , up to 30% of the population remain undetected in the radio waveband in even the deepest maps and the properties of these galaxies remain a mystery . those smgs which can be localised through their radio emission",
    "are usually found in the optical / ir wavebands to be faint , morphologically complex systems , often comprising red galaxies with bluer companions , as expected for a distant , dust - reddened , interacting star - forming population @xcite .",
    "recent advances in their study include the measurement of the redshift distribution of radio - detected smgs @xcite , the resolution of most of the submm background by exploiting gravitational lensing @xcite , the identification of x - ray emission from a significant fraction of the population @xcite , the detection  via broad co lines  of collosal quantities ( @xmath510@xmath6m@xmath7 ) of molecular gas @xcite , and the first indications of the strong clustering expected for such massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "these discoveries underline the importance of studying the far - ir luminous smgs for our understanding the formation of massive galaxies at high redshifts .    for local ir - luminous galaxies , mid - ir data from the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _",
    "were used to develop a number of useful diagnostics to differentiate between those powered predominantly by starbursts and by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "_ iso _ was sensitive to only the most luminous smgs , so efforts to assess the preponderance of agn in smgs have so far been reliant on uv / optical spectroscopy , radio observations , and the aforementioned x - ray imaging , often with ambiguous results .",
    "the fraction of distant , far - ir - luminous galaxies with an energetically dominant agn remains poorly determined , although it is expected to be small : even smgs with unambiguous agn characteristics @xcite are thought to have a major starburst contribution to their bolometric luminosities @xcite .",
    "this finding has been echoed in studies of distant quasars and radio galaxies : far - ir - luminous examples are found to be gas - rich and their submm emission is often resolved , as expected if their power originates in large part from stars @xcite .    in this letter , we use mid - ir continuum imaging of nine mambo - selected smgs in the lockman hole to investigate the use of mid - ir data to identify the counterparts at other wavelengths of this population and demonstrate the power of mid - ir data for determining the likely power source ( agn or starburst ) in these galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported the results of a deep unbiased mambo survey of the lockman hole , a region mapped earlier by scuba for the ` 8-mjy survey ' @xcite .",
    "this region was selected for reasons that included its low galactic cirrus emission and the availability of high - quality complementary data at x - ray , optical / ir and radio wavelengths .",
    "not surprisingly , the same region was selected for some of the earliest imaging with _",
    "spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "the data exploited herein were obtained using irac @xcite and mips @xcite , reaching noise levels of @xmath2 = 0.8 , 0.8 , 2.8 , 1.7 and 30@xmath0jy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 and 24@xmath0 m with absolute calibration accurate to @xmath8% .",
    "these compare with 5-@xmath2 confusion limits ( 20 beams per source ) of around 1.0 , 1.2 and 56@xmath0jy at 3.6 , 8.0 and 24@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the images cover a @xmath9 region , centered near the smg , le850.01 ( table  1 ) .",
    "data were reduced using standard _ spitzer _ data analysis tools , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our analysis also makes use of deep optical imaging from suprimecam on the subaru 8-m telescope ( @xmath10 , vega , 2@xmath11-radius aperture ) , _ xmm - newton _ x - ray data ( @xmath12 , 0.510kev ) and a very large array radio image ( @xmath13 , 1.4ghz ) @xcite .",
    "the @xcite 1200-@xmath0 m sample includes nine @xmath13@xmath2 mambo sources within the region covered by the irac / mips observations .",
    "four are detected at @xmath14@xmath2 , all of which should be secure .",
    "the other five are @xmath13-@xmath2 detections , of which up to two may be the result of noise fluctuations , eddington bias @xcite or confusion .",
    "@xcite performed monte carlo simulations to determine the reliability , completeness and positional accuracy of their source catalog .",
    "we list the flux densities , significance and positions for all nine sources in table  1 and note that the positions are accurate to @xmath144@xmath11 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "1 shows the seds of typical local starburst- and agn - dominated ir - luminous galaxies and several smgs with well - sampled uv  radio spectra .",
    "it is worth reviewing the emission mechanisms operating across the observable wavelength range : where our adopted sample was selected , at 1200@xmath0 m ( rest - frame far - ir ) , we are sensitive to cold dust ( @xmath540k ) created in copious quantities by supernovae ( sne ; @xcite ) , which re - radiates energy absorbed in the uv from hot , young stars . in the radio , at 1.4ghz , we are again sensitive to sne ( and hence to recent star formation ) , via synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons .",
    "contamination via radio - loud agn is possible and , at @xmath0jy flux levels , is virtually impossible to distinguish from pure sne - related emission .",
    "we are also sensitive to agn via x - ray emission from accretion disks and their associated coronae , although determining the origin of the x - rays is not always trivial and heavily obscured ( @xmath15@xmath16 , compton - thick ) agn can evade detection altogether @xcite . at the shortest ir wavelengths accessible to _ spitzer _",
    "( 3.68.0@xmath0 m ) , we are provided  via photospheric emission from stars  with a relatively unobscured measure of stellar luminosity , possibly even of stellar mass in more evolved systems out to @xmath17 . at 24@xmath0 m ( rest - frame @xmath57@xmath0 m for a galaxy at @xmath183 )",
    "we are sensitive to emission from @xmath5500-k dust in the circumnuclear torus of agn , and to the warmest dust in starbursts .",
    "do our _ spitzer _ observations provide sufficient sensitivity to detect dust - enshrouded starbursts and agn in the distant universe ? in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the seds of a selection of well - studied dusty , luminous galaxies and models ( both agn and starbursts ) . these demonstrate the range of rest - frame mid - ir luminosities for these systems and we select arp220 and mrk231 to represent extremes of the the starburst- and agn - dominated sub - classes .",
    "2 shows that even with its steep mid - ir spectrum ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ) , arp220 would be detected at 3.6 and 24@xmath0 m out to @xmath21 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "mrk231 , its mid - ir emission boosted an order of magnitude higher than arp220 by its agn , would be detected out to @xmath22 at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the diagnostic power of the near- and mid - ir bands  the ability to discriminate between starbursts with and without buried , active nuclei  arises from the different physical regimes and spectral features probed across the mid - ir waveband @xcite .",
    "a steeper slope between rest - frame @xmath2310@xmath0 m is apparent for starbursts than for agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "the latter , typified by mrk231 and smmj02399@xmath240136 ( fig .  1 ) , have power - law spectra covering rest - frame @xmath50.210@xmath0 m @xcite . in contrast",
    ", the sed of a starburst like arp220 has a flatter region between 1 and 4@xmath0 m .",
    "thus for mambo galaxies at @xmath253 ( assuming the same median redshift as for scuba galaxies  @xcite ) , the key spectral indices are available in the 3.624-@xmath0 m bands covered by irac and mips .",
    ", a @xmath26 versus @xmath27 color  color plot , shows the tracks of arp220 and mrk231 as they are moved from the local universe to @xmath28 , as well as the track of a synthetic @xmath29-l@xmath7 starburst from @xcite .",
    "we can see immediately that the starburst and agn populations are well separated , and that this plot has strong diagnostic potential : we can define regions where starburst and active galaxies are likely to lie at @xmath303 and hence use this to classify our smgs .",
    "we search for radio and mid - ir counterparts to the mambo sources within their nominal error circles ( illustrated in fig .  4 ) .",
    "we find that all of the four most secure @xmath14@xmath2 mambo sources have robust radio counterparts at 1.4ghz ( as defined by @xcite ) .",
    "this drops slightly to 7/9 robust radio counterparts using all @xmath13@xmath2 mambo sources , somewhat higher than the 18/42 detection rate60-mjy sources , with a noise level 23 times higher than the radio data utilized here .",
    "using equivalent data , our fraction of radio - detected mambo sources would fall to 5/9 , consistent with @xcite . ]",
    "reported by @xcite .",
    "the remaining two have tentative radio identifications at @xmath13@xmath2  but these are not significant enough to be reliable . if instead we had used the 24@xmath0 m _ spitzer _ imaging to identify counterparts we would have identified 8/9 of the @xmath13@xmath2 mambo galaxies with significant 24@xmath0 m sources .",
    "interestingly , all but one of the seven mambo sources with robust radio counterparts are detected at 24@xmath0 m , the exception being mmj105207.2 + 572558 .",
    "combining the two identification schemes increases our confidence in the identification of the proposed counterparts in both wavebands and provides reliable identifications for _ all _ nine smgs in this region .",
    "detections at 24@xmath0 m ( fwhm @xmath5 6@xmath11 ) halve the mm positional uncertainties ( to @xmath142@xmath11 , 95% confidence ) , although the accuracy remains short of that provided by radio imaging ( @xmath140.61.6@xmath11 , 95% confidence  @xcite ) . hence the radio remains the most useful waveband for localising the far - ir emission given sufficiently long integrations .",
    "we next investigate the power of mid - ir observations to identify agn within the smg population .",
    "only one of our nine mambo sources has an x - ray counterpart , mmj105200.2 + 572425 (= le850.08 ) , previously identified by @xcite .",
    "it could be argued that the complexity of this immense merger  there are at least seven distinct optical components in fig .  4  is such that it would be surprising if at least one of the galaxies were not active ! in the absence of the x - ray detection ,",
    "could we have identified which components contain buried agn using only the mid - ir data ? we could .",
    "we list the fluxes of the three resolved mid - ir components in this system separately in table  1 to check whether they have different seds .",
    "1 shows the individual seds , arbitrarily placed at @xmath31 .",
    "the component near - coincident with the brightest _ xmm - newton _ and radio emission ( ` b ' in fig .  4 ; see also @xcite ) has a power - law mid - ir spectrum reminiscent of mrk231 .",
    "component ` a ' ( previously assumed to be the source of x - rays , based on a less precise centroid from _ rosat _ ) was identified as an agn at @xmath32 by @xcite ) and shows a weak break in slope at an observed wavelength around 4@xmath0 m , suggesting a possible mix of agn and star formation power sources . component ` c ' , on the other hand , has a strong short - wavelength upturn indicative of a starburst .",
    "this system allows us to demonstrate the diagnostic power of fig .  3 , with component ` b ' lying close to the track of mrk231 , well separated from the starburst track ; component ` a ' lies between the agn and starburst tracks and within @xmath33 of its predicted redshift based on the sed of mrk231 ; component ` c ' is classified as a pure starburst .",
    "the main area of possible confusion with this diagram is separating high - redshift starbursts from low - redshift agn ; fortunately , as in this case , we can expect agn at @xmath34 to reveal themselves in other wavebands . on the basis of these tests",
    ", it seems reasonable to expect that mid - ir observations with _",
    "spitzer _ will be able to weed out active galaxies within the smg population .    the mid - ir data for the other smgs shown in figs  1 and 3 display a range of characteristics between the extremes of the arp220 and mrk231 templates ,",
    "although the dispersion in fig .  1 must be due partially to the spread in redshift .",
    "over half of the sample display an arp220-like upturn in the mid - ir  with a flat sed out to 8@xmath0 m in the observed frame and a sharp rise thereafter  showing that active galaxies , although present , do not dominate the mambo population . this is consistent with conclusions drawn from uv / optical spectra and x - ray imaging @xcite . using the model / empirical tracks to classify the eight mambo galaxies with measured 3.624-@xmath0 m seds , fig .  3 would indicate six starbursts and two agn .",
    "thus @xmath35% of the smgs in our small sample have mid - ir colors characteristic of high - redshift obscured starbursts .",
    "their mid - ir colors suggest a median redshift of @xmath51.4 for our mambo sample , somewhat lower than the @xmath31 measured for the radio - detected smgs of chapman et al .",
    "this may reflect differences in the selection functions at 850 and 1200@xmath0 m , with the latter selecting a somewhat colder , lower redshift and intrinsically lower - luminosity section of the population , or it may simply be the result of adopting inappropriate sed templates .    if we assume the mambo sources lie at similar redshifts to the scuba population and place the mambo sources at @xmath36 then 8.0@xmath0 m corresponds to rest - frame @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to compare the mambo galaxies with the @xmath37-corrected spectrum of arp220 ( fig .",
    "arp220 has an absolute @xmath38 magnitude of @xmath2424.4 , roughly 1.3l@xmath39 @xcite , and would have an 8.0-@xmath0 m flux of @xmath52@xmath0jy at @xmath40 .",
    "the median 8.0-@xmath0 m flux of the @xmath14@xmath2 mambo sources is @xmath520@xmath0jy , implying naively that these galaxies are already @xmath515l@xmath41 .",
    "the more plausible alternatives are that these galaxies lie at lower redshifts than we have assumed ( @xmath422 , as implied by fig .",
    "3 ) or that their observed 8.0-@xmath0 m luminosity is dominated by massive , young stars or hot dust . determining the exact cause of the apparently immense mid - ir luminosities of these smgs will require spectoscopic observations in the optical and mid - ir to confirm their redshifts and the details of their mid - ir spectral properties .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations between 3.6 and 24@xmath0 m of nine galaxies selected at 1200@xmath0 m have improved our confidence in the identification of secure counterparts , complementing what was learned from radio imaging .",
    "robust identifications have been possible for @xmath590% of the mambo galaxies using 24-@xmath0 m imaging , a similar fraction to that achievable from radio imaging .",
    "together , radio and mid - ir imaging have yielded plausible counterparts for the entire mambo sample in this region .",
    "we conclude that 3.624-@xmath0 m observations provide a useful tool to aid in identifying smgs .",
    "accretion onto an obscured central engine is sometimes betrayed by the shape of the mid - ir continuum , confirming _ spitzer _ s potential to weed out active galaxies .",
    "the fraction of mm galaxies with energetically - important agn in our small sample , 25% ( or 560% at the 95% confidence level ) , is similar to that estimated from uv / optical spectroscopy and deep x - ray imaging @xcite , but the majority of mambo galaxies have rest - frame mid-/far - ir seds commensurate with obscured starbursts .",

    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , california institute of technology ( caltech ) under nasa contract 1407 .",
