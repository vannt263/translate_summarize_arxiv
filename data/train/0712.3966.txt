    "the nuclear @xmath15 decay is a rare second order semi - leptonic transition between two even @xmath16-even @xmath17 isobars @xmath18x and @xmath19y involving strangeness conserving charged weak currents .",
    "the @xmath15 decay can be broadly classified into four experimentally distinguishable modes , namely two neutrino double beta @xmath20 decay @xcite , neutrinoless double beta @xmath21 decay @xcite , single majoron accompanied neutrinoless double beta @xmath22 decay @xcite and double majoron accompanied neutrinoless double beta @xmath23 decay @xcite .",
    "the@xmath24 decay conserves the lepton number @xmath25 exactly and is an allowed process within the standard model of electroweak unification ( _ sm _ ) . in @xmath26 decay ,",
    "the conservation of lepton number is violated by two units and it is possible in models beyond the _ sm _ , namely guts ( left - right symmetric so(10 ) , e(6 ) etc . ) , r@xmath27conserving as well as violating susy models , leptoquark , compositeness and sterile neutrino scenarios .",
    "in fact , the experimental observation of @xmath28 decay would immediately imply that neutrinos are majorana particles and all the present experimental activities are directed towards the observation of this particular decay mode .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 decay modes are possible processes in nine majoron models as discussed by bamert and co - workers @xcite",
    ".    these decay modes can proceed via emission of two electrons ( @xmath29 ) , emission of two positrons ( @xmath30 ) , electron - positron conversion ( @xmath31 ) and double electron capture ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the latter three are energetically competing modes and we refer to them as @xmath33 modes .",
    "there are 35 @xmath34 and 34 @xmath33 emitters .",
    "further , the transitions in @xmath15 decay modes may be from @xmath35 states .",
    "presently , the study of @xmath34 decay for the @xmath7 transition is the most preferable as the other decay rates are suppressed due to kinematic reasons .",
    "however , the study of other decay modes will be of importance in distinguishing the role of different mechanisms involved in @xmath36 decay once it is observed .",
    "thus , the experimental as well as theoretical study of nuclear @xmath15 decay is quite wide in scope and has been excellently reviewed over the past years [ 6 - 23 ] . in the present work ,",
    "we restrict our study to @xmath0 decay of @xmath37zr , @xmath2mo , @xmath3ru , @xmath4pd , @xmath5te and @xmath6nd isotopes for the @xmath7 transition only .",
    "the study of @xmath0 decay is quite interesting from the nuclear structure point of view .",
    "the @xmath38 decay has been experimentally observed in case of ten nuclei namely , @xmath39ca , @xmath40ge , @xmath41se , @xmath42zr , @xmath43mo , @xmath44cd , @xmath5te , @xmath6nd and @xmath45u out of 35 possible candidates @xcite and one can extract nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntmes ) from the observed half - lives . using the average half - lives @xcite and the phase space factors @xcite",
    ", the extracted ntmes @xmath8 vary from 0.0152@xmath460.0008 ( 0.0238@xmath460.0013 ) to 0.1222@xmath460.0034 ( 0.1909@xmath460.0053 ) for @xmath47 ( 1.00 ) corresponding to @xmath48te and @xmath49mo respectively .",
    "a comparison between the theoretically calculated and experimentally extracted ntmes provides a cross - check on the reliability of different nuclear models used for the calculation of ntmes .",
    "it is observed in all cases of @xmath0  decay that the ntmes@xmath50 are sufficiently quenched .",
    "the calculation of @xmath8 requires the knowledge of the @xmath51 or ( p , n ) amplitude for the initial nucleus and the @xmath52 or ( n , p ) amplitude of the final nucleus , which in turn requires a complete set of states of the intermediate nucleus in addition to the initial and final nuclear states .",
    "the understanding as well as realization of this quenching mechanism is the main motive of all the theoretical calculations . in solving this problem ,",
    "different nuclear models and nuclear structure scenarios have been applied .",
    "nuclear models , which are used in the calculation of ntmes of @xmath9 decay , can be broadly classified in to shell model and its variants , quasiparticle random phase approximations ( qrpa )  and extensions to it and alternative models .",
    "the details about these models -their advantages as well as limitations- have been discussed by suhonen and civitarese @xcite and faessler and simkovic @xcite .",
    "the shell - model is the best choice for the calculation of the ntmes as it attempts to solve the nuclear many - body problem as exactly as possible .",
    "the large scale shell model calculations by caurier _",
    "_ are more realistic in which @xmath40ge , @xmath41se , @xmath53sn , @xmath54te , @xmath48te and @xmath55xe have been studied @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 of @xmath41se is calculated exactly and those of @xmath40ge and @xmath55xe are dealt in a nearly exact manner @xcite . in the qrpa model , vogel and zirnbauer were the first to provide an explanation of the observed suppression of @xmath56 by a proper inclusion of ground state correlations through the proton - neutron _ p - p _ interaction in the _ _",
    "s__=1 , _ _",
    "t__=0 channel and the calculated half - lives are in close agreement with all the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the qrpa frequently overestimates the ground state correlations and to cure the strong suppression of @xmath8 due to increase in the attractive proton - neutron interaction , several extensions of qrpa have been proposed .",
    "the most important proposals are inclusion of proton - neutron pairing , renormalized qrpa , higher qrpa , multiple commutator method ( mcm ) and particle number projection . however , none of the above methods is free from ambiguities @xcite .",
    "alternative models , as the operator expansion method ( oem ) , the broken su(4 ) symmetry , two vacua rpa , the pseudo su(3 ) and the single state dominance hypothesis ( ssdh ) have their own problems @xcite .    the @xmath57 decay has not been experimentally observed hitherto , and only limits on half - lives of @xmath58 decay are available .",
    "klapdor and his collaborators have reported the @xmath57 decay of @xmath40ge in heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite . however , it is felt that the reported result needs independent verification by other experiments @xcite .",
    "the observed half - life limits permit to extract limits on various effective lepton number violating parameters , namely majorona neutrino mass , coupling of left and right handed weak currents , mass of right handed heavy neutrino , mass of right handed w - boson , intergeneration yukawa coupling constants of susy models , leptoquark coupling constants , compositeness scale , constraint on sterile neutrinos , majoron coupling constants , vep and vli parameters using the theoretically calculated ntmes of @xmath57 decay . in order to get accurate",
    "effective lepton number violating parameters , one has to calculate reliable ntmes for @xmath57 decay . in the absence of experimental data , it is difficult to judge the reliability of wave functions involved in the calculation of ntmes of @xmath59 decay .",
    "usually , the reliability of wave functions is tested by reproducing the experimentally extracted ntmes @xmath8 as both the modes involve same set of initial and final wave functions although the nuclear transition operators are sensitive to different spin - isospin correlations in @xmath60 and @xmath57 decay modes .    the two main ingredients deciding the structure of nuclei participating in @xmath61 decay are the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom .",
    "the crucial role of deformation on ntmes @xmath8 has been predicted in the case of @xmath0 decay of @xmath49mo and @xmath6nd @xcite .",
    "the existence of an inverse correlation between the gt strength and quadrupole moment has been already shown by auerbach _",
    "et al _ @xcite and troltenier _ et al _ @xcite . the effect of deformation on the distribution of the gamow - teller strength and @xmath62-decay properties",
    "has been studied using a quasiparticle tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) based on deformed hartree - fock ( dhf ) calculations with skyrme interactions @xcite and in deformed self consistent hf+bcs+qrpa method with skyrme type interactions @xcite . ncher _",
    "et al _ @xcite have presented a novel method of deducing the deformation of @xmath63 nucleus @xmath40sr , based on the comparison of the experimental gt strength distribution @xmath64 from its decay with the results of qrpa calculations . a deformed qrpa formalism , using deformed woods - saxon potentials and deformed skyrme hartree - fock mean fields , was developed to describe simultaneously the energy distributions of the single-@xmath62 gt strength and the @xmath60 decay matrix elements @xcite . the deformation effect on the @xmath0 decay for ground - state transition of @xmath40ge was studied in the framework of the deformed qrpa with separable gamow - teller ( gt ) residual interaction @xcite .",
    "in the light of above discussions , the projected hartree - fock bogoliubov ( phfb ) model is a convenient choice as an alternative model in which the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom are incorporated on equal footing and the rotational symmetry is restored by projection technique providing wave functions with good angular momentum for the parent and daughter nuclei involved in @xmath15 decay . however , the phfb model is unable to provide information about the structure of the intermediate odd - odd nuclei in its present version and hence , on the single @xmath62 decay rates and the distribution of gt strength . in spite of this limitation , the phfb model , in conjunction with pairing plus",
    "quadrupole - quadrupole ( _ pqq _ ) interaction @xcite , has been successfully applied to study the @xmath65 decay for the @xmath66 transition where it was possible to describe the lowest excited states of the parent and daughter nuclei along with their electromagnetic transition strengths , as well as to reproduce their measured @xmath15 decay rates @xcite . in the phfb model ,",
    "the role of deformation in reproducing realistic ntmes @xmath8 has also been investigated and it has been observed that there exists an inverse correlation between the latter and the former @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we add a hexadecapole - hexadecapole interaction term @xmath67 to the standard _",
