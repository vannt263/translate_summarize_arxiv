    "there is a pressing need to solve quantum field theories in the nonperturbative regime . over the last thirty years",
    "a significant amount of progress has been made in this area using lattice gauge theory .",
    "many of the most interesting quantities in qcd and electroweak physics are being calculated to ever increasing accuracy .",
    "there remains , however , a number of nonperturbative quantities in supersymmetric quantum field theories that are interesting in a variety of formal physics contexts but have not been calculated .",
    "some of these calculations are now just beginning to be considered .",
    "with increased interest in the physics of extra dimensions , it is more important than ever to solve supersymmetric theories in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "the progress in putting supersymmetry on a lattice has been rather slow due to some critical problems : the lack of translational invariance on a lattice , the notorious doubling of fermion states  @xcite , and the breakdown of the leibniz rule  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , some interesting new approaches have shed some light on this issue  @xcite .",
    "these approaches make possible the restoration of supersymmetry in a continuum limit without fine - tuning of parameters and even without introducing some `` sophisticated '' fermions such as domain - wall  @xcite or overlap fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques seem to be applicable to only some subset of all supersymmetric theories .",
    "given this increasing interest and promising new ideas for the realization of supersymmetry on a lattice , it is worthwhile to provide some specific , detailed numerical results using supersymmetric discretized light cone quantization ( sdlcq )  @xcite for the simplest theory for which the new lattice techniques are applicable .",
    "sdlcq is a well established tool for calculations of physical quantities in supersymmetric gauge theory and has been exploited for many supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theories .",
    "the @xmath0 theory in 1 + 1 dimensions in the large-@xmath2 limit is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the published results are primitive compared to what can be obtained today because of our greatly improved hardware and software . in this paper",
    "we are now able to reach a resolution of @xmath10 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite we could reach only @xmath11 . here",
    "we will present new and more detailed results on this theory against which the lattice community can compare the results of their new techniques .",
    "briefly , the sdlcq method rests on the ability to produce an exact representation of the superalgebra but is otherwise very similar to discrete light cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite . in dlcq",
    "we compactify the @xmath12 direction by putting the system on a circle with a period of @xmath13 , which discretizes the longitudinal momentum as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an integer . the total longitudinal momentum @xmath16 becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an integer called the harmonic resolution  @xcite .",
    "the positivity of the light - cone longitudinal momenta then limits the number of possible fock states for a given @xmath18 , and , thus , the dimension of fock space becomes finite , enabling us to do some numerical computations .",
    "it is assumed that as @xmath18 approaches infinity , the solutions to this large finite problem approach the solutions of the field theory .",
    "the difference between dlcq and sdlcq lies in the choice of discretizing either @xmath19 or @xmath20 to construct the matrix approximation to the eigenvalue problem @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . for more details and additional discussion of sdlcq",
    ", we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting new result of the calculation we present here is that finite - dimensional representations of the sdlcq with odd and even values of @xmath18 result in very distinct solutions of the @xmath23 sym theory , which only become identical as @xmath18 approaches infinity .",
    "one might initially think that this is a shortcoming of the sdlcq approach , but it turns out to be an advantage because it provides an internal measure of convergence .",
    "we will give some numerical results of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "there we will see that as we go to higher and higher resolutions , we find bound states with lower and lower mass .",
    "we have seen this behavior in the @xmath24 theory where the lowest mass state converges linearly to zero as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "this closing of the mass gap as @xmath26 was predicted by witten  @xcite for the @xmath24 and @xmath0 theories .",
    "we find that in the latter case the convergence is not linear in @xmath27 , and , while our results are consistent with the mass gap going to zero , they are not conclusive .",
    "we have also been able to solve analytically for the wave functions of some of the pure bosonic massless states , and we will present the exact form of the wave function for some cases . we will show that the states must have certain properties to be massless , which then enable us to count the number of the states for a given resolution @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we will present the formulae to count a minimum total number of massless states .    finally , we will look at the two - point correlation function of the stress - energy tensor @xmath28 .",
    "we see the expected @xmath29-behavior in the uv and ir regions , and , interestingly , we find that the correlator behaves as @xmath30 in the intermediate region .",
    "we know of no predictions for this behavior ; however , for @xmath31 sym theory there is a prediction that this correlator should behave like @xmath32 in the intermediate region .",

    "before giving the numerical results , let us quickly review some analytical work on @xmath33=(2,2 ) sym theory for the sake of completeness",
    ". for more details see ref .",

    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath64 are the same",
    ". we may choose either one of the two @xmath65 s , at least for our purposes , and in what follows we will use @xmath68 and will suppress the subscript unless it is needed for clarity .",
    "the momentum , @xmath16 , is given by @xmath69 we work with a fixed value of momentum @xmath70 we call @xmath18 the resolution because larger values of @xmath18 allow larger values of @xmath71 while leaving the momentum @xmath16 fixed .",
    "the next thing to note is that there are three @xmath72 symmetries of @xmath73 .",
    "the first one is @xmath74-symmetry , where @xmath75 acts as follows a_1ij a_2ij , b_-b _ the second is @xmath76-symmetry a_i ij -a_i ji , b_ij - b_ji .",
    "the third is what we call @xmath77-symmetry a_iij - a_iij , b _",
    "it is easy to see that under these symmetries @xmath68 is invariant .    using the relations , @xmath78 we find @xmath79 also note that @xmath80 we work in a subspace of definite momentum so @xmath81 must have non zero eigenvectors .",
    "since @xmath61 and @xmath65 are fermionic operators we see that a bosonic energy eigenstate @xmath82 which is even under @xmath83 and @xmath77-symmetry , can be transformed into    which are all degenerate with @xmath82 .",
    "one should notice here that we can not use @xmath68 and @xmath84 at the same time since they do not commute with each other .",
    "thus , including the supersymmetry , we have an 8-fold degeneracy . utilizing the remaining @xmath76-symmetry , which does not give us a mass degeneracy",
    ", we can divide the mass spectrum into 16 independent sectors .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of the computational problem",
    ". it will be convenient to refer to bound states of this theory as having @xmath76 , @xmath77 , or @xmath83 even or odd parity and to refer to a state as having even or odd resolutions if @xmath18 is an even or odd integer .",
    "tables  [ mass+ ] and [ mass- ] show the first few low - mass states .",
    "we find anomalously light states in the sectors with opposite @xmath18 and @xmath76 parity for @xmath18 larger than 4 .",
    "furthermore , the number of extremely light states increases by one as we increase @xmath18 by two .",
    "we believe that these anomalously light states should be exactly massless states , but for some reason there is an impediment preventing sdlcq from achieving this result .",
    "some of the evidence for this comes from a study of the average number of partons @xmath85 in the bound states .",
    "for example , in the sector with @xmath76 and @xmath18 even , for each even integer @xmath4 less than @xmath18 , there is exactly one bosonic massless state with @xmath86 . for @xmath18 odd we do not see massless states of this type , but we do find @xmath86 for the anomalously light bound states in this sector .",
    "this is also the first sign of the distinction between representations of the supersymmetry algebra in different symmetry sectors , namely those with anomalously light states ( with opposite @xmath76 and @xmath18 parity ) and those without anomalously light states ( with matching @xmath76 and @xmath18 parity ) .",
    ".the mass squared @xmath87 of the first few lowest massive states in the @xmath76-even sector in units of @xmath88 for a series of resolutions @xmath18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to respond to the increasing interest in calculating supersymmetric theories on a lattice  @xcite , we have presented detailed numerical results for the low - energy spectrum and the two - point correlation function of the stress - energy tensor , using sdlcq for @xmath33=(2,2 ) sym theory in @xmath89 dimensions in the large-@xmath2 approximation .",
    "our hope is that these results will serve as benchmarks for others to compare and check their results .",
    "in addition , we found an important new aspect of the sdlcq approximation in this calculation .",
    "there seem to be two distinct classes of representations for @xmath33=(2,2 ) sym theory , one where @xmath76 and @xmath18 have the same parity and one where @xmath76 and @xmath18 have opposite parity ; these representations become identical as @xmath26 .",
    "we found evidence for this feature of @xmath33=(2,2 ) sym theory in both the mass spectrum and the correlator .",
    "we also found that there are some anomalously light states that appear only in the sectors where @xmath76 and @xmath18 have opposite parity .",
    "we argued that the anomalously light states should be exactly massless , but have acquired a tiny mass because of some impediment to having them exactly massless in the sdlcq approximation . in the calculation of the correlator where only positive s parity contribute we found that there is exactly one massless state that contributes to the correlator when @xmath18 has positive parity and that no massless state or anomalously light state contributes when @xmath18 has negative parity .",
    "the lightest massive state in the sector where @xmath18 has negative parity does contribute to the correlator , but because the mass gap appears to close at infinite resolution this state appears to become massless , as expected  @xcite .",
    "the two - point correlator of the stress - energy tensor was found to show @xmath29-behavior in the uv ( small @xmath4 ) and ir ( large @xmath4 , @xmath18 even ) regions as expected .",
    "the large @xmath4 behavior for @xmath18 odd , on the other hand , has an exponential decay .",
    "surprisingly , the correlator behaves like @xmath30 at intermediate values of @xmath4 . in @xmath33=(8,8 ) sym theory in @xmath89 dimensions , the correlator is expected to behave like @xmath32 in the intermediate region , and it is interesting that @xmath33=(2,2 ) behaves similarly but with a different exponent . we were able to confirm this power law behavior with a flat region in the derivative of the scaled correlator .",
    "previously , in our calculation of the @xmath33=(8,8 ) correlator at lower resolutions , we were not able to find this flat region .",
    "we are hopeful that in the near future we may be able to conclusively confirm the @xmath32 behavior in the @xmath33=(8,8 ) theory .",
    "interestingly , we also note that earlier results seem to indicate the same type of odd / even behavior for the @xmath33=(8,8 ) theory .    analytically , we investigated the properties of pure bosonic massless states and found the necessary and sufficient conditions to determine their wave function .",
    "then we explored some special cases to find that there are @xmath90 massless states of type @xmath91|0\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a flavor index and the number in the parentheses tells how many units of momentum each parton carries , and that there are two massless states of the type @xmath93|0\\rangle.\\ ] ] we also gave the formulae to count a minimum total number of massless states for a sym theory which is demensionally reduced to one spatial and one time dimensions .",
    "what prevents us from reaching even higher @xmath18 is obviously the fact that , as one can show  @xcite , the total number of basis states grows like @xmath94 , where @xmath15 is the total number of particle types and @xmath95 for @xmath33=(2,2 ) sym theory .",
    "our numerical results were obtained using one single pc with memory of 4 gb . the problem that we now face is that we do not have enough memory to store all the states in one pc . however , as we make use of a cluster of pcs and find ways to split and share the information among them , we are able to reach even higher @xmath18 .",
    "this is the direction of our future work , with the ultimate goal being to achieve sufficient numerical precision to detect the correspondence between @xmath31 sym theory and supergravity conjectured by maldacena  @xcite .",
