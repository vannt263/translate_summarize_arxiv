    "the primordial cosmic gas is composed by hydrogen ( about 75 per cent by mass ) , helium ( @xmath7 per cent ) , and traces of other light elements , like deuterium , helium-3 , lithium and berillium .",
    "when this gas collapses into the dark matter halos typical of galaxy clusters ( @xmath8 ) , it undergoes shocks and adiabatic compression , reaching densities of about @xmath9 particles @xmath10 and temperatures of the order of @xmath11 k. for these physical conditions , the plasma is optically thin and its x - ray emission is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "its enrichment by metals ( i.e. elements with atomic number larger than 5 ) proceeds by the releases to the medium of the products of the star formation activities that take place in the member galaxies .",
    "an effective way to estimate the metal abundance by number relative to hydrogen is to measure the equivalent width of the emission lines above the x - ray thermal continuum .",
    "nowadays , the iron abundance is routinely determined in nearby systems thanks , in particular , to the prominence of the k - shell ( i.e. the lower level of the electron transition is at the principal quantum number @xmath12 ) iron line emission at rest - frame energies of 6.6 - 7.0 kev ( fe xxv and fe xxvi ) .",
    "furthermore , the few x - ray galaxy clusters known at @xmath13 have shown well detected fe line , given sufficiently long ( @xmath14 ksec ) _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ exposures ( rosati et al .",
    "2004 , hashimoto et al .",
    "2004 , tozzi et al .",
    "it is more difficult is to assess the abundance of the other prominent metals that should appear in an x - ray spectrum at energies ( observer rest frame ) between @xmath5 and @xmath15 kev , such as oxygen ( o viii ) at ( cluster rest frame ) 0.65 kev , silicon ( si xiv ) at 2.0 kev , sulfur ( s xvi ) at 2.6 kev , and nickel ( ni ) at 7.8 kev .",
    "a direct application of the detection of emission lines from these highly ionized elements is the possibility to describe the way the intracluster medium ( icm ) is enriched of metals , whether by products from explosions of supernovae ( sn ) type ia , mainly rich in fe and ni , or by outputs of collapsed massive stars ( core collapsed sn ) , with relative higher contributions of @xmath16elements like o , si , s. however , the ability to resolve and measure elemental abundances other than iron , which was observed in the early days of the x - ray analysis of galaxy clusters ( e.g. mitchell et al .",

    "we reverse the problem and infer from observed and modeled sn rates the total and relative amount of metals that should be present in the icm both locally and at high redshifts . through our phenomenological approach , we adopt the models of sn rates as a function of redshift that reproduce well both the very recent observational determinations of sn rates at @xmath17 ( dahlen et al .",
    "2004 , cappellaro et al . 2005 ) and the measurements of the star formation rate derived from uv - luminosity densities and ir data sets .",
    "we then compare the products of the enrichment process to the constraints obtained in the x - ray band for galaxy clusters observed up to @xmath18 .",
    "we note that previous work on the production of iron in galaxy clusters by , e.g. , matteucci & vettolani ( 1988 ) , arnaud et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and renzini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) made use of sn rates that were known , with large uncertainties , only at @xmath19 .",
    "however , they concluded that either the sn ia rates were higher by a factor of 10 in the past or the production of iron in clusters by core - collapsed supernovae ( sne cc ) would require a very flat initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that sn cc produce 1/4 of the iron and the remnants 3/4 is released from sn ia , which would also be in accordance with the standard chemical model for the galactic halo and disk , allowing an imf in elliptical galaxies similar to the one in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to infer the mass of the most relevant and x - ray detectable elements present in the icm and their relative abundance as function of redshift by using reliable ( i.e. in agreement with several different observational constraints ) models of sn explosion rates that include a dependence on the cosmological time .",
    "the fact that these rates are in unit of number per comoving volume and rest - frame time allows us to use them also over cosmological distances typical of high - redshift systems .",
    "the method presented here is a first attempt to provide well - motivated and analytic predictions of the expected metal abundances at @xmath20 and of the relative role played by sne ia and sne cc in polluting the icm over time .",

    "apart from fe , the most prominent lines detectable in x - ray spectra , like o , si , s and ni , were investigated initially with data from _ asca _ ( an analysis of the average abundance of all the galaxy clusters in the _ asca _ archive is presented in baumgartner et al .",

    "[ fig : yfe_z0 ] , we summarize these results by plotting the relative number abundance ratios . the iron abundance is about @xmath58 , although the _ asca _ measurements have a very narrow distribution around the mean of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 at 90 per cent level of confidence ) that departs significantly from the spatially resolved _ xmm - newton _ estimates ( only in the outer radius , between 200 and 500 @xmath62 kpc , where the fe / h decreases by about a factor of 2 with respect to the central estimate , it becomes consistent with the _ asca _ mean with a value of @xmath63 ) .",
    "moreover , the o / fe ratio is about solar , whereas the si / fe and s / fe ratios are roughly super - solar and sub - solar , respectively . the average ni / fe ratio in the _ asca _ sample is about @xmath64 , well in agreement with the original _ asca _ determination in the data of the perseus cluster by dupke & arnaud ( 2001 ) and consistent with the _ xmm - newton _ constraints in gastaldello & molendi ( 2004 ) and with the _ bepposax _ results for a sample of 22 objects ( fig .  6 in de grandi & molendi 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that the measurements of the nickel abundance becomes reliable only in hot ( @xmath65 kev ) systems where the excitation of ( mainly ) k - shell lines makes them detectable in the spectrum around 8 kev , in a region less contaminated from blends with iron but highly affected from a proper background subtraction .",
    "these difficulties put the actual limitations on solid ni measurements for a large data set .",

    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath78 relation for simulated galaxy clusters ( e.g. ettori et al .",
    "2004b ) , with an emission - weighted temperature greater than @xmath79 kev , provides a typical virial mass ( and corresponding volume ) that is larger than the above value by about 20 per cent .",
    "we discuss in section  4 the effect of this discrepancy on the overall results . the volume measured at @xmath41",
    "is considered as the dimension of the region involved in the formation of a typical galaxy cluster and is maintained constant in redshift .",
    "the supernovae rates , i.e. _ the number of sn per rest - frame time and comoving volume _ , come from models that fit well the observed values and reproduce properly the star formation rate ( sfr ) as widely discussed in strolger et al .",

    "[ fig : r_cc_ia ] the relative rates of sne cc and ia as function of redshift : this ratio ranges between 2 and 3 up to @xmath4 and increases steeply at higher redshifts , with the  narrow \" gaussian function that provides a sn ia rate at @xmath96 lower by an order of magnitude than the other delay time distribution functions .",
    "regarding the adopted delay time , we mention here that gal - yam & maoz ( 2004 ) and maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) support the argument that some current data on the cosmic ( field ) star formation history require for the observed rate of sne ia a delay time larger than 3 gyr . combining this with the low observed rate of cluster sn ia at @xmath97 ,",
    "they conclude that the measured amount of iron in clusters can not be produced mainly by sne ia explosions but , more probably , must be produced via outputs of sne cc originating from a top - heavy imf .",
    "the reader is refereed to the above - mentioned work for a detailed discussion on the effects of the assumed imf on the sn rates .",
    "our approach here is to use the best phenomenological models of cosmic star formation history to infer the corresponding cluster metal accumulation history and to compare some predictions with the observational constraints available .",
    "to produce the cluster metal accumulation history , we have to take into account the fraction of the total produced iron mass that remains locked up in the stars .",
    "the fraction of the total iron that is then released to the icm is estimated by considering that @xmath98 .",
    "we adopt @xmath99 ( see fig .",

    "sample has a mean @xmath37 associated to a 5 kev object that is between 30 ( when the @xmath78 relation from simulations is adopted ) and 60 ( with the observed @xmath78 relation ) per cent higher than the iron mass accumulated in the icm through sn activities from @xmath104 .",
    "the latter value is , however , well within the scatter in the observed distribution . at higher redshift , the observed central value in the tozzi et al .",
    "sample of fe abundance measurements is a factor of about 3 higher than the predicted one .",
    "it is worth noticing that this result does not depend significantly upon either the delay time distribution function adopted to calculate @xmath105 or the sn cc and ia compilations assumed .",
    "the changes in the total iron mass accumulated at @xmath106 are in the order of 10 per cent when different @xmath83 are considered and of about 40 per cent ( i.e. the ratio of the observed and the predicted values ranges between 1.01.2 and 1.41.8 ; see table  [ tab : test ] ) when we use the calculations of sn cc explosions in two extreme cases presented in woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and described at the end of this section .",
    "note that , if the sn ia rate in number per comoving volume and rest - frame year is converted to supernova unit ( 1 snu = 1 sn per 100 year per @xmath107 ) with an assumed local b - band luminosity density of @xmath108 mpc@xmath72 which evolves as @xmath109 ( see dahlen et al .",
    "2004 for the caveats in using such conversion for rates estimated on cosmological distances ) , we obtain a local ( @xmath110 ) rate of @xmath111 and @xmath112 snu for sn ia and cc , respectively . by integrating the snu values over the cosmic time , we measure a local @xmath113 of @xmath114 and @xmath115 as due to sn ia and cc , respectively , with a dependence upon the redshift very similar to what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfe_z ] .",
    "the sum of these values is still a factor between 3 and 5 lower than the present estimate in galaxy clusters : this estimate , however , is affected from the extension of the cluster region considered to measure b - band luminosities and iron mass distribution ( see discussion on the uncertainties of these measurements in de grandi et al .",
    "2004 , sect.3.2 ) . therefore ,",
    "even though we solve most of the discrepancy between predicted and measured iron mass in typical galaxy clusters through models of sn rates that make use of the number of sn per comoving volume and rest - frame time , some difficulties remain in recovering the observed @xmath113 ratio through a direct , but not straightforward ( given the evolution with redshift of the b - band luminosity density ) , conversion to the number of sn per unit of b - band luminosity ( e.g. arnaud et al .",
    "1992 , renzini et al .",
    "1993 ) . regarding the latter issue , note that the suggested solution of an increase of the sn ia rate in e / s0 galaxies by a factor of 510 at higher@xmath116 is partially taken into account in the models presented here ( see , e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : r_cc_ia ] ) , where the sn ia rate is enhanced by a factor of @xmath117 from @xmath41 to @xmath118 , but then decreases rapidly beyond it .",
    "we can now extend these considerations to the enrichment history of the metals other than fe . to infer these ,",
    "we adopt , as done in the x - ray analyses presented above , the solar abundances tabulated in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and the most recent and widely used theoretical metal yields of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for ( i ) sne cc integrated between @xmath15 and @xmath119 for a salpeter imf ( see nakamura et al .",

    "all the numerical values considered here are presented in table  1 .",
    "we note that the values presented in nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are plotted relative to the solar photospheric abundance in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the latter values have been revised to match the meteoritic determinations , as summarized in grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , and require conversion factors of @xmath120 to correct the original photospheric abundance for fe , o , si , s and ni , respectively .",
    "we have , however , adopted the anders & grevesse values for consistency between models and observational constraints .    given a metal @xmath121 , its total mass is estimated as @xmath122 where the synthesized masses for each element of interest , @xmath123 , or the corresponding abundance yields , @xmath124 , are presented in table  1 .",
    "one direct way to check the consistency of these models is to compare the ratio between some of the most prominent elements detectable in x - ray spectra and the iron . to this purpose , we overplot in fig .  [",
    "fig : yfe_z0 ] the abundance ratios inferred from the models to the observational constraints on the o / fe , si / fe , s / fe and ni / fe discussed in section  2 .",

    "because of this kind of uncertainty in relating the cluster gas temperature to the associated virial and iron masses , we conclude that the agreement between the expected and measured iron mass , even though marginal , is acceptable within the observed scatter .",
    "moreover , we can reproduce the relative number abundance of the most prominent metals detectable in an x - ray spectrum , such as oxygen , silicon , sulfur and nickel with respect to the iron as estimated for nearby bright objects observed both with _ asca _ ( baumgartner et al .",
    "2005 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( tamura et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we also show that the predicted evolution in the iron abundance , which should decrease by a factor of 2 at @xmath4 with respect to the local value , is in good agreement with the current observational constraints obtained from a sample of 49 clusters at @xmath145 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fe_z ] ) .    by using these models to describe the icm enrichment",
    ", we can infer the relative sn contribution to the amount of elements present in galaxy clusters as function of the cosmic time . at increasing redshift ,",
    "the products from sne cc become dominant , owing to the steep rise of their relative rate with respect to sne ia .",
    "the transition occurs between @xmath146 and @xmath6 , with an enhancement of the @xmath16elements with respect to fe ( e.g. o / fe and si / fe ratios increase by a factor of more than 2 ) and a drastic decrease of the ni / fe ratio ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : yfe_z ] ) .",
    "then , the fractions of metals mass due to sn ia outputs , which are locally about 51 , 75 , 1 , 14 and 21 per cent of the total for iron , nickel , oxygen , silicon and sulfur , respectively , halve at @xmath4 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mia_z ] ) , almost independently from the adopted delay time distribution functions and models for sn cc explosions . when the assumed sn rates ( number per comoving volume per rest - frame year ) are converted to units of the b - band luminosity ( but see caveats in dahlen et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is well mapped only in nearby galaxy clusters , we show that the expected total @xmath113 is still below the local measurement by a factor between 3 and 5 and that sn ia metal production contributes by @xmath13770 per cent .",
    "we conclude that this well - known ( e.g. arnaud et al .",
    "1992 , renzini et al . 1993 ) underestimate of the local @xmath113 value can not be explained with an increase in the sn rates at higher redshift , according to the present models .",
    "the changes by a factor of 2 in the abundance ratios at @xmath147 arising from the predominance of the enrichment through sne cc might be investigated in the near future with x - ray spectroscopically resolved metal abundance estimates in high - redshift galaxy clusters .",
    "we are attempting this with our _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data set of high@xmath116 objects ( tozzi et al .",
    "2003 , ettori et al .",
    "2004a ) , with expected relative uncertainties on the abundance ratios of larger than @xmath148 per cent at the @xmath149 level ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fe_z ] ) .",
    "these x - ray satellites offer the best compromise available at present between field - of - view , effective area , and the spatial and spectral resolution required to pursue such a study . only with _",
    "xeus _ and its sensitivity greater by two orders of magnitude than that of _ xmm - newton _ and a spectral resolution of the order of 10 ev or less , will it be possible to investigate with significantly higher accuracy the metal budget of the icm in high@xmath116 systems .",

    "italo balestra is thanked for the spectral analysis of the data presented in fig .",
