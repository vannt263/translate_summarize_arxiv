    "at atmospheric pressure and below approximately @xmath1 , @xmath0 forms a liquid phase , called he  i , whose dynamics can be described by the navier - stokes equation . when this liquid is cooled below @xmath2",
    ", it undergoes a phase transition , the `` superfluid '' transition .",
    "the new liquid phase is called he  ii .",
    "the hydrodynamics of this phase can be described with the so - called two - fluid model@xcite , ie . as a superposition of a normal component which behaves like a classical navier - stokes fluid with finite viscosity and a superfluid one with zero - viscosity and quantized vorticity .",
    "the ratio of superfluid density versus total density , @xmath3 increases from 0 to 1 when temperature decreases from @xmath4 to 0  k ( typical values are given in table [ tab : heprop ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare the statistics of turbulent flows above and below this `` superfluid '' transition .    to achieve this goal , we need a local sensor that can work both above and below @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , the most efficient sensors available , can only operate in one of these phases , hot - wires for @xmath5@xcite , and quantum vortex lines density probes for @xmath6@xcite .",
    "one alternative possibility is to use stagnation pressure probes .",
    "the operating principle is similar to pitot or prandtl tubes : the velocity difference between the tip of the probe where the flow is stopped and the average flow velocity produces a pressure head @xmath7 .",
    "this effect is inertial , and therefore such probes can be used as well in he  i as in he  ii .    the first successful attempt to resolve velocity fluctuation in liquid helium with a stagnation pressure probe",
    "was reported in 1998 by maurer and tabeling@xcite in a turbulent von krmn flow both above and below @xmath4 .",
    "the velocity spectra in he  ii were found very similar to those in he  i. specifically they found a @xmath8 scaling over 1.5 decade of frequency .",
    "this pioneering result provides the first experimental evidence that superfluid can undergo a kolmogorov - like turbulent cascade . yet",
    ", there has been no published experimental confirmation of this result . for reference",
    ", we point that numerical works have reported spectrum compatible with a -5/3 scaling at finite temperature@xcite and in the zero temperature limit@xcite .",
    "the reader can report to the review of vinen and niemela for an introduction to quantum turbulence@xcite .",
    "this paper presents an extension of this experimental result in different geometries .",
    "we report studies of stagnation pressure measurements both in he  i and he  ii for three kinds of flow : grid turbulence , wake near field flow and `` chunk '' flow with two objectives in mind : ( i ) to check that the experiment when done in a classical fluid like he  i reproduces expected statistical signatures for the turbulence and ( ii ) to compare the statistical signatures for flows in he  i with those in he  ii .",
