    "the last two decades have seen remarkable progress in understanding the so - called kpz universality class in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "this is a rather broad and somewhat vaguely defined class of probabilistic systems describing random interface growth , named after a seminal physics paper of kardar  parisi  zhang of 1986 @xcite .",
    "a key conjectural property of the systems in this class is that the large time fluctuations of the interfaces should be the same for all of them .",
    "see corwin @xcite for an extensive survey .",
    "while proving such a universality principle remains largely out of reach , by now many concrete systems have been found , for which the needed asymptotics was actually computed ( the universality principle appears to hold so far ) .",
    "the first wave of these solved systems started in late 1990 s with the papers of johansson @xcite and baik  deift ",
    "johansson @xcite , and the key to their solvability , or _ integrability _",
    ", was in ( highly non - obvious ) reductions to what physicists would call _ free - fermion models _  probabilistic systems , many of whose observables are expressed in terms of determinants and pfaffians .",
    "another domain where free - fermion models are extremely important is random matrix theory .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the large time fluctuations of the ( 1 + 1)d kpz models are very similar to those arising in ( largest eigenvalues of ) random matrices with real spectra .",
    "the second wave of integrable ( 1 + 1)d kpz systems started in late 2000 s .",
    "the reasons for their solvability are harder to see , but one way or another they can be traced to quantum integrable systems .",
    "for example , looking at the earlier papers of the second wave we see that : ( a ) the pioneering work of tracy ",
    "widom @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) was based on the famous idea of bethe @xcite of looking for eigenfunctions of a quantum many - body system in the form of superposition of those for noninteracting bodies ( coordinate bethe ansatz ) ; ( b ) the work of oconnell @xcite and borodin ",
    "corwin @xcite on semi - discrete brownian polymers utilized properties of eigenfunctions of the macdonald  ruijsenaars quantum integrable system  the celebrated macdonald polynomials and their degenerations ; ( c ) the physics papers of dotsenko @xcite and calabrese  le doussal  rosso @xcite , and a later work of borodin  corwin ",
    "sasamoto @xcite used a duality trick to show that certain observables of infinite - dimensional models solve finite - dimensional quantum many - body systems that are , in their turn , solvable by the coordinate bethe ansatz ; etc .",
    "in fact , most currently known integrable ( 1 + 1)d kpz models of the second wave come from _",
    "one and the same _ quantum integrable system : corwin  petrov @xcite recently showed that they can be realized as suitable limits of what they called a _",
    "stochastic higher spin vertex model _ , see the introduction to their paper for a description of degenerations .",
    "they used duality and coordinate bethe ansatz to show the integrability of their model ; the bethe ansatz part relied on previous works of borodin  corwin  petrov  sasamoto @xcite , @xcite , and borodin @xcite .",
    "the main subject of the present paper is the _ inhomogeneous _ higher spin six vertex model in infinite volume ; one homogeneous version of it is the model of @xcite .",
    "our main result is an integral representation for certain multi - point @xmath0-moments of this model .",
    "such formulas are well known to be a source of meaningful asymptotic results , but we leave asymptotic questions outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "several of those are forthcoming , and they will be presented as separate publications .    at least for the simplest _ step initial condition _ ,",
    "our formula for @xmath0-moments degenerates , in appropriate limits , to most known formulas of this type , which includes all the models mentioned above .",
    "it also generalizes those quite a bit .",
    "we introduce two ( infinite ) sets of inhomogeneities ( space inhomogeneities and spins ) . together with another set of time inhomogeneities ( spectral parameters ) that were already present in @xcite , they supply a large amount of freedom in the model , which can be used to induce unusual phase transitions ( that work is also forthcoming ) .",
    "remarkably , all the parameters enter the expressions for @xmath0-moments in a rather benign way , still allowing those to be used for the purpose of accessing the asymptotics . in a way ,",
    "this is similar to parameters of the schur and macdonald processes , cf .",
    "okounkov  reshetikhin @xcite and borodin  corwin @xcite , but at the moment this is no more than a vague comparison .",
    "our methods are also new .",
    "the core of our proofs consists of the so - called ( skew ) cauchy identities for certain rational symmetric functions .",
    "they also depend on two families of parameters ( the third family  spectral parameters  are their arguments ) .",
    "homogeneous versions of these functions were introduced in @xcite . for special parameter values ,",
    "these functions turn into ( skew ) hall  littlewood and schur symmetric functions , and the name `` cauchy identities '' is borrowed from the theory of those , cf .",
    "macdonald @xcite .",
    "our symmetric rational functions can be defined as partition functions of the higher spin six vertex model for domains with special boundary conditions .",
    "following @xcite , we use the _ yang  baxter equation _ , or rather its infinite - volume limit , to derive the cauchy identities . a similar approach to cauchy - like identities for the hall ",
    "littlewood polynomials was also realized by wheeler ",
    "zinn  justin in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the cauchy identities themselves are essentially sufficient to define our probabilistic models , show their connection to kpz interfaces , prove orthogonality and completeness of our symmetric rational functions in appropriate functional spaces , and evaluate averages of a large family of observables with respect to our measures .",
    "the last bit can be derived from comparing cauchy identities with different sets of parameters .",
    "while the cauchy identities also played an important role in the theory of schur and macdonald processes , they were never the main heroes there . in the present work",
    "they really take the central stage .",
    "given their direct relation to the yang ",
    "baxter equation , one could thus say that the _ integrability of the ( 1 + 1)d kpz models takes its origin in the yang ",
    "baxter integrability of the six vertex model .",
    "_    our present approach circumvents the duality trick that has been so powerful in treating the integrable ( 1 + 1)d kpz models ( including that of @xcite ) .",
    "we do explain how the duality can be discovered from our results , but we do not prove or rely on it .",
    "unfortunately , for the moment the use and success of the duality approach remains somewhat mysterious and ad hoc ; the form of the duality functional needs to be guessed from previously known examples ( some of which have better explanations , cf .",
    "schtz @xcite , borodin ",
    "corwin @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the path that we present here is more straightforward , and that it can be used to shed further light on the existence of nontrivial dualities .",

    "<S> our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric rational functions that can be defined as partition functions of the inhomogeneous higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains . in the homogeneous case , </S>",
