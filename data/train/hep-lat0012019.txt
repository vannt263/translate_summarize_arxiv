    "dimensional reduction is a powerful technique to study the infrared region of field theories at high temperature@xcite@xcite .",
    "combined with a non - perturbative lattice simulation of the reduced model , it has been employed to investigate the properties of gauge theories and qcd with dynamical quarks in the plasma phase @xcite@xcite . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still not clear , what are the limitations and the domain of validity of this approach .",
    "therefore , in a recent work @xcite , we have studied in detail the reduction to two dimensions of pure gauge qcd in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions at high temperature .",
    "we refer the reader to this article for a more complete discussion of our motivations , references to the related literature and details on the reduction procedure .",
    "the reduced model is a model for scalars belonging to the su(3 ) algebra ( formerly the electric gluons in a static gauge ) .",
    "they interact with the 2d gauge fields , the static parts of the original 3d spatial gauge fields , and via an effective potential whose self - couplings are computed by perturbative integration over the non - static degrees of freedom . in @xcite we restricted the perturbative integration to the one loop order .",
    "the main conclusion of our investigation is that dimensional reduction works very well in this case .",
    "in particular it was shown that it works within a few percent for the correlation function of polyakov loops ( as well as for spacelike wilson loops ) down to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the critical temperature in the @xmath25 theory .",
    "in fact for @xmath26 numerical simulations showed that the polyakov loops correlations measured in ( 2 + 1)d qcd and in the reduced model were very close to one another down to quite short distances , although our formalism is in principle an expansion both in high temperature and in @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the relevant momentum scale .",
    "it was further shown , by simulations at different values of the bare parameters , that our measurements are in the scaling region , and thus our results are valid in the continuum limit .",
    "less expected was the observation that these correlations assume a shape typical of _ single _ particle propagation , as opposed to the standard picture of a screening mass associated with _",
    "two _ massive electric gluons .",
    "this feature , together with our previous motivations , invites us to pursue the numerical exploration of the reduced model per se , in particular the investigation of states connected with the polyakov loop correlations .    while in @xcite we only measured the correlations of polyakov loops , here we analyze separately those of su(3 ) invariant polynomials of degree @xmath8 in the elementary scalars @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 .",
    "the action is invariant under a global sign reversal of all the @xmath29 s .",
    "this @xmath0-symmetry , which we denote by @xmath31 , following the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponds to euclidean time reversal in the @xmath25 theory . in this latter article",
    "it was suggested to investigate operators odd under this symmetry , to obtain a possible gauge invariant definition of the debye mass . to investigate both operators which are even and odd under @xmath31 we consider separately correlations involving even and odd polynomials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath31 -symmetry may be spontaneously broken in the @xmath32 model .",
    "in fact there exists two phases , corresponding to @xmath31 being conserved or broken . only in the symmetric phase",
    ", the model corresponds to the reduction of the high temperature @xmath33 qcd phase @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the details of the actual phase diagram will not be studied in the present article . from our data",
    "we can conclude , however , that the values of the coupling constants in the reduced @xmath32 theory are in the unphysical broken phase . in the same way",
    "as has been done for the reduction from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , we solve this problem by working in the metastable part of the symmetric phase . using zero field initial conditions on large enough lattices , we make sure that we stay in the phase of unbroken @xmath31 , where even and odd operators do not mix .",
    "investigations of states in the full and reduced model in the case of the @xmath36 reduction can be found in @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite , although a detailed analysis of the nature of these states , as we perform in this paper , have not yet been made .",
    "the 2d action under consideration is recalled in section 2 , together with its meaning in terms of the ( 2 + 1)d qcd model , from which it originates , and the relevant operators and correlations are defined .",
    "the simulations are performed in the temperature range @xmath37 to @xmath38 , where @xmath24 is the deconfining temperature of the latter model .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 . in section 3 ,",
    "we first show that the measured correlations fulfill the factorization properties expected if the lowest states in the @xmath39even and @xmath39odd channels are two distinct one particle states , whose masses are then extracted from the large distance decays . according to the criteria proposed in ref.@xcite , the state found in the odd channel",
    "is a candidate to _ define _ a debye screening mass , although not the only one . in section 4 , we further analyze the composite operators @xmath40 and @xmath3 and their correlations @xmath41 , showing that all the properties observed for @xmath5 can be deduced with a good accuracy from their knowledge for @xmath6 .",
    "this follows from the assumption that , given the su(3 ) and @xmath42 symmetry constraints , the effective model for the elementary @xmath29 s after integration over the gauge fields is a free field model for the massive composites @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in particular , we give evidence that the ( small ) deviations from factorization observed at short distances are mainly due to intermediate states containing two of the above particles .",
    "the summary and the conclusions can be found in a last section 5 .",
    "in this section , we write down the reduced 2d action derived in @xcite , and define our notations and the quantities of interest for the present work .",
    "the lattice is an @xmath45 square ; the spacing is @xmath46 , set to one unless specified otherwise .",

    "the three correlations all have the same shape , and they decrease by about one order of magnitude each time two more powers of @xmath29 are involved . the same is true for the odd cases , with a common decay of the correlations steeper than in the former case ( smaller correlation length in lattice units ) .",
    "the overall situation is similar for @xmath64 higher . for @xmath51 larger than 5 , as well as for @xmath64 very large , the signal /",
    "noise ratio becomes very small .",
    "this can be understood at the qualitative level by noting that the rescaling eq.([phi ] ) of the @xmath29-fields normalizes the kinetic term for the @xmath77-fields to the standard , parameter independent form @xmath107 .",
    "hence if the field renormalization by the interactions is weak , the @xmath77 correlations should depend only weakly on @xmath64 , which means that @xmath41 scales like @xmath108 .",
    "this will be illustrated more quantitatively in section 4 .",
    "due to this scale factor , the @xmath29-fields remain `` small '' in practice down to quite low values of @xmath64 , which a posteriori explains why the perturbative reduction may still work at a temperature as low as 1.5 @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , we checked that the polyakov loop correlations are actually fully reconstructed within errors by keeping @xmath109 up to @xmath110 only in their expansion in @xmath41 s obtained from the small @xmath29 expansion of ( [ plc ] ) .",

    "that it is so is demonstrated on figs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) showing @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( symbols @xmath124 ) for @xmath83 and 5.7 ( @xmath125 and 84 ) .",
    "the agreement is very good in all cases , although the quality of the data is poorer for @xmath123 due to the correlations involving @xmath126 getting very small .",
    "similar results are obtained for other values of @xmath96 .",
    "we thus conclude at this point that single particle propagation accounts very well for the largest correlation length occuring in each of the two channels .",
    "most of the observed deviations of @xmath127 from one will be interpreted in the next section in terms of two particle state contributions ( symbols @xmath128 in the same figures ) .",
    "we now proceed to assign values to the two lowest masses @xmath99 and @xmath100 expected from the above findings .",
    "this we do by various ways , in order to further enforce the statement that the correlations do have the characteristics associated with the pole structure of eq .",

    "we find that @xmath140 is indeed nearly constant , in fact slowly decreasing towards a value compatible with @xmath141 , due to smaller and steeper contributions to ( [ plc ] ) of the heavier particle @xmath98 .",
    "a contrario , we invalidate the interpretation of the largest correlation length in @xmath142 as being @xmath8 times shorter than the `` debye screening length '' , the inverse of a mass @xmath143 associated with `` electric '' gluons of the initial ( 2 + 1)d model ( the scalars of the reduced model ) .",
    "this scenario was advocated by dhoker in his perturbative study of @xmath144 at high temperature @xcite .",

    "we nevertheless tried fits with ( [ cut ] ) , but got definitely worse agreement , in the range of temperatures , which we have investigated , i.e up to @xmath38 .",

    "a similar agreement is found for the relation a_3,5(r)=a_2a_3,3(r ) , derived in the appendix .",
    "a new situation arises when we consider @xmath179 or @xmath180 where both the initial and final states may couple to a two particle state , @xmath181 or @xmath182 respectively .",
    "then the intermediate state in a connected correlation between @xmath183 and @xmath101 may consist of either one or two particles .",

    "we see that the corrections to factorization implied by two - particle propagation provide a reasonable explanation of the behaviour observed for the @xmath187 s at intermediate and short distances .",
    "this is especially true in the case of @xmath122 , showing that there is very little room for contributions from direct non - quadratic couplings in @xmath152 in the full effective action ( that resulting from integration over the gauge fields ) .",
    "this justifies our statement that the residual interactions between the colourless boundstates of the adjoint scalars are very weak .",
    "in this paper , we have studied properties of the two dimensional model derived in @xcite by dimensional reduction of 3d qcd at high temperature . in this model , scalar fields @xmath29 in the adjoint representation of su(3 ) interacts via su(3 ) gauge fields @xmath188 , in addition to a self - interaction generated by integration over the non - static 3d gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "such properties are interesting since it was shown in @xcite that dimensional reduction works remarkably well in this case .",
    "also , they offer an opportunity to explore non - perturbative features in a low dimensional situation where the ir singularities are particularly severe .    by means of numerical simulations",
    ", we explored that part of phase space where the @xmath31-symmetry @xmath189 is unbroken , in accordance with the small @xmath29 expansion used to derive the model , known to be valid quite soon above the transition temperature of pure 3d qcd .",
    "we identified two boundstates @xmath48 and @xmath98 , respectively even and odd under @xmath31 , and thus coupled to monomials respectively of degree @xmath190 and @xmath191 in the @xmath29 s .",
    "the @xmath48 signal coincides with that previously obtained from polyakov loops correlations @xcite , where however the @xmath98-state contributions could not be disentangled .",
    "these results came out from the measurement of three even - even and three odd - odd distinct correlations , as functions of the on - axis lattice distance @xmath101 .",
    "great care was taken in the analysis of their shape in @xmath101 , with the result that in all cases , the signal found was that expected from the occurrence of genuine poles in momentum space .",
    "a contrario , this demonstrates that the picture where the decay with @xmath101 of such correlations reflects the propagation in 3d of @xmath192 or @xmath191 `` electric gluons '' , i.e. a correlation length equal to @xmath193 times the `` debye screening length '' , is inadequate in the case under study .    by comparing the size of the three different correlations measured for each of the @xmath48 and @xmath98 sectors",
    ", we were able to show that residue factorization holds , as expected on general grounds when one particle propagates between different states .",
    "the agreement with factorization was expectedly found to be particularly good at large distances , but we could even show that deviations at shorter distances are to a large extent compatible with propagation of two particles , namely two @xmath48 or @xmath48 and @xmath98 respectively in the @xmath48 or @xmath98 channel .",
    "the overall picture thus is that the scalar sector of the reduced model at large distances , thought to accurately describe static properties of 3d qcd at high temperature , consists of two weakly interacting colourless particles , respectively even and odd under the @xmath31 symmetry of the model .",
    "there are several problems , which this study invites to investigate further",
    ". of course , similarly detailed analysis for full qcd in ( 3 + 1)d would be interesting .",
    "furthermore , the construction of a reduced model where the @xmath58-symmetry of the pure gauge theory is not spoiled by the reduction process is highly desirable @xcite , with the hope that it exhibits a transition to a symmetric @xmath58 phase analogous to the low temperature qcd phase .",
