    "supermanifolds were introduced by berezin , leites and konstant in the 1970s as a mathematical framework for the quantum theory of commuting and anticommuting fields .",
    "a remarkable contribution was berezin s definition of his integral , in ref .",
    "@xcite , predating the definition of supermanifolds by several years , and providing at the time sufficient indication that a reasonable supersymmetric analysis should exist .    despite its utility ,",
    "the integral suffers from a fundamental pathology : only the integral of _ compactly supported _ quantities is well - defined in a coordinate independent form ",
    "changes of variables introduce , in general , so - called _ boundary terms_. this can be seen as a major obstacle in the development of global superanalysis .",
    "for example , although stokes s theorem @xmath0 has been extended to supermanifolds by bernstein and leites @xcite , this extension supposes that the supermanifold structure on the boundary @xmath1 enjoys a rather strong compatibility requirement .",
    "in fact , even for compactly supported integrands @xmath2 , the conclusion of the theorem _ fails _ in general , unless this assumption is made ( _ cf . _   below ) .",
    "an invariant definition of the integral can however be made , on the basis of the following simple observation : for any supermanifold @xmath3 , there exist morphisms @xmath4which we call _ retractions_which are left inverse to the canonical embedding @xmath5 .",
    "any retraction @xmath6 is a submersion whose fibres have compact base ; thus , there is a well - defined _ fibre integral _",
    "@xmath7 which takes berezin forms on @xmath3 to volume forms on @xmath8 , and one may define @xmath9    taking pullback retractions , this definition is now trivially well - defined under coordinate changes . furthermore , whereas retractions are non - unique in general , for certain classes of supermanifolds_e.g .",
    "_ , lie supergroups @xmath10 , homogeneous @xmath10-supermanifolds , and superdomains  there exist canonical retractions .",
    "this framework allows us to give an explicit description of the behaviour of the integral under coordinate changes .",
    "to state our main result ( ) , let @xmath11 be an open subspace of a supermanifold whose underlying space @xmath12 is a manifold with corners .",
    "that is , we have @xmath13 for some functions @xmath14 which define _ boundary manifolds _ @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath16 be retractions on @xmath17 . on each @xmath18 ,",

    "then , for any berezin density @xmath2 such that the integrals exist , @xmath25    here ,",
    "we sum over all @xmath26 and all multi - indices @xmath27 ; moreover , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the multi - index @xmath30 with entries reduced by one .",
    "the differential operators on the right hand side are of degree up to @xmath31 .    from this change of variables formula",
    ", we deduce a version of stokes s theorem which is valid for an arbitrary supermanifold structure on the boundary ( ) . compared to equation  , the right hand side depends not only on @xmath32 , but on transversal derivatives up to order @xmath31 .",
    "the question of defining the integral of non - compactly supported berezinians was first studied by rothstein @xcite in his seminal paper .",
    "his fundamental insight was that the integral becomes well - defined if instead of the berezinian sheaf , one considers the sheaf of super - differential operators with values in volume forms . this insight is vital  indeed , rothstein s techniques form the basis of our investigations , and one may view equation   as an attempt to translate rothstein s definition of the berezin integral _ via _ the ` fermi integral ' to the realm of ordinary berezinians .    for applications to superanalysis ,",
    "rothstein s sheaf is somewhat unwieldy , since it is an @xmath33-module of infinite rank .",
    "for example , in the context of homogeneous supermanifolds , one frequently fixes integrands by invariance .",
    "of course , this can only be done for @xmath33-modules of rank one , which favours the berezinian sheaf as a tool for superanalysis .",
    "the applications we have in mind come from the spherical harmonic analysis on riemannian symmetric supermanifolds , in particular , the study of orbital and eisenstein integrals in the spirit of harish - chandra . besides its relation to representation theory @xcite ,",
    "this subject is of high current interest in mathematical physics , in the study of @xmath34-model approximations of invariant random matrix ensembles , as are applied to disordered metals and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "let us end with a brief synopsis of our paper .",
    "in , we recall some basic facts and define the integral of berezin densities with respect to a retraction . in",
    ", we prove a version of stokes s theorem in this setting ( ) . here , the supermanifold structure on the boundary has to be chosen compatibly ( see below ) . in , we prove a version of our change of variables formula in terms of coordinates ( ) . here , the ` boundary ' nature of the ` boundary terms ' is not yet evident .",
    "this is finally accomplished in , where the language and technique of supermanifolds with corners and boundary supermanifolds is introduced ; here , the point of view of retractions proves particularly fruitful . by applying this machinery , we prove our main result ( ) and illustrate its use in some examples . finally , we deduce a generalised stokes s theorem ( ) where the supermanifold structure on the boundary is arbitrary .",
