    "the analysis of resonant tunneling through semiconductor heterostructures has a lot of interest from a fundamental point of view as well as for its applications as microelectronic devices @xcite . from the analysis of the tunneling current as a function of an external dc bias",
    "many properties of the electronic band structure and of the excitations in the system can be deduced .",
    "the application of an external field increases the parameters which can be externally controlled and gives additional information of the heterostructure and therefore increases the applications of these systems as devices .",
    "the analysis of the magnetotunneling current for both configurations , parallel and perpendicular to the growth direction of the heterostructure has been the subject of many papers @xcite and gives information on the density of states in the well corresponding to the landau level ladder , in the first case and on the edge states in the second configuration . also the application of a radiation field",
    "modifies the transport properties of these resonant devices .",
    "+ the work of sollner et al@xcite , is the experimental starting point for studies on the effect of time - dependent potentials in resonant tunneling through semiconductor microstructures : they studied the influence of electromagnetic radiation on resonant tunneling current .",
    "recently chitta et al @xcite have studied the far infrared response of double barrier resonant tunneling structures .",
    "tien and gordon @xcite , studied the effect that microwave radiation has on superconducting tunneling devices .",
    "several authors @xcite have investigated the effect that external time dependent potentials have in different problems . in a recent work @xcite we have developed a model to analyze the coherent and sequential tunneling current in the presence of a photon field through a double barrier structure .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the effect of a photon field on both coherent and sequential magnetotunneling current through a dbs for a static magnetic field applied in the direction of the current .",
    "we have developed a quantum mechanical formalism to find the expression for the electronic state dressed by photons and we propose a model to obtain the sequential magnetotunneling current under the influence of an external electromagnetic field for linearly polarized light . by means of this model",
    "we obtain the charge into the well and its modifications due to the external electromagnetic field . +    in our model for sequential magnetotunneling , before switching on the light , we consider that electrons tunnel coherently through the first barrier , then they loss memory within the well and in a third step they cross coherently the second barrier . in the presence of a magnetic field , coherent",
    "tunneling implies landau level index conservation , however , for sequential tunneling , due to the scattering processes which take place into the well structure , the landau level index corresponding to the states which contribute to the current is not conserved from the emitter to the collector .",
    "if a laser is switched on , it changes the charge occupation in the well and consequently the number of landau levels ( ll ) which contribute to the current density .",
    "we have analyzed this effect for different photon frequencies and field intensities as well as the change of the magnetotunneling current for different ratios between cyclotron and photon frequencies .",
    "we have compared also the two contributions to the magnetotunneling current : coherent versus sequential .",
    "+    this paper is organized as follows : in sec ii , we discuss and develop the theoretical formalism for the coherent and sequential magnetotunneling in the presence of a photon field . in sec iii , we applied the discussed formalism to analyze both contributions to the current : sequential and coherent for different ratios between the cyclotron and the photon frequencies .",
    "also the accumulated charge into the well for different magnetic and electromagnetic fields is analyzed for sequential magnetotunneling and therefore how the light changes the number of landau levels which contribute to the sequential tunneling .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec iv .",
    "we have analyzed the coherent magnetotunneling current density through a double barrier when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the current in the presence of light .",
    "we have considered light linearly polarized in the far infrared regime , and polarized in the same direction as the static magnetic field applied . for that configuration ,",
    "the electronic motion is modified by the light only in the current direction and the electronic lateral state becomes unaffected by light @xcite . with no magnetic field present in the sample",
    "the parallel component for the electronic wave vector is conserved during the coherent tunneling process .",
    "now as the magnetic field is switched on , is the landau level index what is conserved : the current characteristic curve presents a peak as a function of the external bias when a landau level in the emitter aligns with the corresponding landau level in the well . as the magnetic field increases ,",
    "less landau levels contribute to the current , but the degeneration of each ll increases , giving in the current less peaks but more intense .",
    "+ the effect of a magnetic field @xmath0 , parallel to the current direction , i.e. , the @xmath1 direction , is to change the parallel part of the density of states and due to that instead of a continuum of states we have now a landau levels ladder . if a laser is applied to the sample , the hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an electromagnetic field in the configuration considered above and a magnetic field parallel to the current can be describe in second quantization as : @xmath2 where @xmath3\\\\ w_{od}(t)&= & \\sum_{k}\\sum_{k^{'}\\neq k } [ ( e / m^{*})<k^{'}|p_{z}|k >    c_{k^{'}}^{+ } c_{k } ( \\hbar/2\\epsilon vw)^{1/2 }     ( a e^{-iwt } + a^{+ } e^{iwt})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the magnetic field intensity , @xmath5 is the cyclotron frequency : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the creation and destruction operators for the landau states , and @xmath9 is the electronic energy perpendicular part and @xmath10 being @xmath11 the photon frequency ( the wave vector of the electromagnetic field has been neglected ) .",

    "+ the electrons lose coherence when tunnel through the structure due to the different scattering processes which suffer with impurities , surface roughness , phonons .. once the electrons cross the first barrier and if the scattering time is shorter than the tunneling time they relax into the well losing memory and in a next step they cross coherently the collector barrier .",
    "+ in order to study the sequential tunneling current , before illuminating the sample , we have calculated in the framework of the transfer hamiltonian formalism the current through the first and the second barriers separately , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",

    "+    we will consider now the sequential magnetotunneling current : before switching on the light the electrons tunnel sequentially through the first and second barrier suffering scattering events into the well as it was previously discussed . in this case",
    ", the ll index conservation takes place from the first barrier to the well and from there to the collector independently and not through the whole structure as in the case of coherent tunneling .",

    "once the external electromagnetic field is applied to the structure , there is a coupling between the photons and the electrons tunneling through the barrier structure .",
    "now the electrons have three different ways to tunnel through the emitter barrier to the well .",
    "the first one is a direct way and corresponds to an emitter state which resonates with the well state , i.e .",
    ", the transmission takes place without light absorption or emission .",
    "the second one is through and absorption process from an emitter state which is found at one photon energy below the resonant well state and finally the third way is through an emission process from an emitter state which is found at one photon energy above the resonant well state .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain the next expression for the sequential magnetotunneling current assisted by light : @xmath58 de_{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have analyzed the effect of an external laser in the far infrared regime on the magnetotunneling current density through a semiconductor double barrier .",
    "the magnetic field and the electromagnetic field are applied in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "1 . in fig 2a",
    "the coherent magnetocurrent density is represented as a function of the external bias for a magnetic field of 24 t and in the presence of an external electromagnetic field with a frequency of 10.3 mev and an intensity 5 @xmath59 v / m . in this case",
    ", only one ll contributes to the tunneling current and the analysis of the effect of the light on the current can be done in a simpler way than in the case where more ll participate in the current .",
    "the current difference between the case where there is a laser present and where there is no light applied to the heterostructure is represented in fig 2b . in this case",
    "we observe a main peak which appears for smaller bias than the corresponding to the threshold bias for the magnetotunneling current with no light present . as the bias increases the current difference decreases and becomes negative .",
    "there is also a small positive and a negative structure for higher bias and as the bias corresponding to the cut off of the current is reached there is an additional positive contribution to the current difference .",
    "these features can be schematically explained in figure 3 : for small bias the resonant state in the well with energy corresponding to the first ll is higher in energy than the fermi energy in the emitter . as the bias increases there are electrons close to the fermi energy which are able to absorb a photon and tunnel resonantly from the first landau level in the emitter with landau level index conservation , therefore the threshold bias for the current is smaller than the corresponding one for no light present ( it moves twice the photon energy ) and there is a positive peak in the current difference . for higher bias the first landau level in the well crosses the fermi energy in the emitter and the current difference becomes negative abruptly due to the fact that the electrons in the emitter have the possibility to absorb a photon and it reduces the number of electrons efficient to tunnel resonantly . for higher bias",
    "there are absorption , emission and direct tunneling processes whose combinations give the positive structure observed . as the bias increases and the energy of the resonant state in the well for the first ll lyes one photon higher than the conduction band bottom of the emitter the electrons have a probability to emit a photon below the bottom of the conduction band and the resonant current is reduced .",
    "( it corresponds to the small negative contribution to the current difference for high bias ) once the resonant state crosses the bottom of the conduction band there are electrons in the emitter which can emit a photon and tunnel resonantly , therefore there is a positive peak in the current difference and the current cut off moves to higher bias",
    ". +    as the magnetic field decreases there are more landau levels which contribute coherently to the current . in fig .",
    "4a the current as a function of the external bias is represented for a field of 8 tesla .",
    "we observe four ll which contribute to the current .",
    "the photon frequency is 6.9 mev ( one half of the cyclotron frequency ) .",
    "the current difference is shown in figure 4b . in this case",
    "the main peak in the current difference due to the effect of the light appears at different bias for the different landau levels and the contribution at the cut off is added up for the four levels . in fig .",
    "the current difference has been drawn separately for each landau level , for the same case as in fig .",
    "4b . if one now changes the photon frequency to the same value as the cyclotron one for the same magnetic field ( 8 t ) the current difference changes dramatically and the main contribution comes from the peak at the threshold bias and an additional narrow structure in this region of bias ( fig .",
    "5a ) . for higher bias",
    "the additional features to the current difference are much smaller in intensity than in the previous case ( fig .",
    "the reason for this difference between both cases is not only the change of the bias threshold and cut off of the current due to the difference of photon frequencies ( the threshold bias is lower for higher photon frequencies and the cut off bias is larger for higher photon frequencies ) but also is due to the fact that when the ratio of the cyclotron frequency to the photon frequency is one , there are absorption and emission processes taking place for electrons coming from different landau levels which compensate each other .",
    "this feature can be observed in fig .",
    "5b , where the contribution to the current density coming from each ll is represented .",
    "due to this compensation it is possible to control the the effect of the light on the magnetocurrent by tuning the ratio between the cyclotron and the photon frequency .",
    "+    as we have already discussed , in order to see the total effect of the light on the magnetocurrent the sequential contribution to the current and the modifications it suffers due to the light should be analyzed .",
    "we have evaluated the sequential magnetotunneling current for the same cases as the coherent one : in fig .",
    "6a and 6b the current density and the current density difference are represented for a magnetic field of 24 tesla and an electromagnetic field of energy 10.3 mev ( one fourth of the cyclotron energy ) .",
    "the structure observed in the current difference can be understood in the same footing as in the coherent case .",
    "+ as the magnetic field is decreased to 8 tesla the four peaks in the sequential magnetocurrent indicates the participation of four landau levels ( fig.7a ) .",
    "the current difference for a laser field of 6.9 mev ( one half of the cyclotron frequency ) is represented ( fig.7b and 7c ) and similar features as in the coherent case are observed but comparing with the coherent case ( fig.4b ) we obtain that the effect of the light is smaller for the sequential current than for the coherent one in spite of the fact that the current density due to both contributions are of the same order . when the frequency of the applied laser is the same as the cyclotron frequency ( the photon energy is 13.8 mev ) there are again compensations in the current difference coming from different landau levels ( figures 8a and 8b ) and the light affects mainly the current density at the threshold and the cut off bias .",
    "+    in summary , the observed feature coming from our calculations is that the coherent contribution to the magnetotunneling current is more affected by light than the sequential one and that the effect of a laser on both contributions to the current can be controlled and modified by tuning the ratio between the cyclotron and the photon frequency .",
    "a drastic modification is observed when this ratio becomes one .",
    "+    there is an additional effect which occurs when the electrons tunnel sequentially and which can also be externally modified by an external electromagnetic field .",
    "it is the fact that when sequential tunneling takes place , the electrons which have tunneled coherently through the first barrier conserving the landau level index in the process , relax into the well and tunnel coherently in a subsequent process through the second barrier .",
    "therefore the number of the landau levels at the emitter contributing to the current can be different than the corresponding to the landau levels in the well participating in the tunneling current through the second barrier , and those numbers can be modified applying an external laser .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "9a , where at low field ( 6 t ) there are many landau levels giving current .",
    "the dotted line represents the magnetocurrent when no light is present into the sample and the continuous line corresponds to the case where a laser with a frequency of 7 mev and intensity of 5 @xmath60 v / m is applied to the sample .",
    "we observed that the current with no light presents a sawtooth profile coming from the participation of additional landau levels as the bias increases . when the light is switched on , the current threshold moves to lower bias and",
    "there is a three step like structure between each jump . for high electromagnetic field intensities",
    "the effect of light can be seen clearly in the current density curve as in fig .",
    "9a . in fig , 9.b )",
    "we represent the total number of landau levels partially occupied in the well as a function of the bias for both cases : with ( continuous line ) and with no light ( dotted line ) .",
    "we observe clearly for instance , that around 0.04 v the second landau level begins to be occupied in the case where the light is present in the sample .",
    "as the bias slightly increases the second landau level begins also to contribute to the current through the second barrier even with no applied light .",
    "as the bias increases , the well is discharged and the second landau level becomes empty for the case in which there is no light present ( dotted line ) .",
    "finally , for high bias , the second landau level becomes discharged for smaller bias in the case where there is no light present ( dotted line ) than in the presence of a laser ( continuous line ) . from the above discussion we conclude that for a fixed bias the number of landau levels participating in the sequential magnetocurrent through the second barrier ( which is determined from the landau level occupation in the well ) can be modified illuminating the sample .",
    "in this paper we have extended the formalism proposed for photoassisted tunneling @xcite to analyze both coherent and sequential magnetotunneling through a double barrier structure .",
    "we have considered a magnetic field applied parallel to the current and a laser with the electric field in the same direction as the current .",
    "we have observed firstable that the modification of the current ( for both , sequential and coherent processes ) due to the photon field can be controlled by tuning the ratio between the cyclotron and the photon frequency , turning on that when this ratio becomes one , there is a compensation in the current difference coming from different landau levels and this magnitude changes drastically and most of the structure observed in the cases where the cyclotron and the photon frequency are different is quenched .",
    "+    other interesting effect is that the light changes the landau level occupation and modifies for a fixed bias , the number of landau levels which participate in the current through the emitter ( @xmath24 ) and also through the collector barrier ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it means that for a given sample and an external magnetic field , by changing the photon frequency and intensity of the external applied laser is possible to get information on the landau level density of states in the well .    in conclusion",
    ", the effect of the light on the magnetotunneling current has been analyzed for both coherent and sequential tunneling processes , turning on that it is the former the most affected by light .",
    "this effect can be controlled by tuning the ratio between the two characteristic frequencies : the cyclotron and photon ones and it can be drastically modified when this ratio becomes one .",
    "very interesting effects are also expected for smaller systems where the electron - electron interaction is important and where the occupation of the resonant structure is crucial for the electron transport .",
    "this is the aim of a future work .",
