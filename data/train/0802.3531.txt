    "compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies are among the rarest type of dwarf galaxy . of the three ces known within @xmath6 mpc ( m32 , ngc 4486b , and ngc 5846a ) , all are neighbors of much more massive galaxies , and all appear to be tidally truncated ( e.g. king 1962 ; rood 1965 , king & kiser 1973 ) .",
    "there are other high surface brightness compact galaxies in the local universe with young populations that are interacting with larger companions , such as ngc 1510 , that may be ces in distinct stages of their evolution . despite the tantalizing hints that interactions with a much larger galaxy may play a key role in the formation of ces",
    ", these objects do not appear in large numbers in nearby galaxy clusters , and many candidate ces have turned out to be background ellipticals ( e.g. ziegler & bender 1998 ; drinkwater & gregg 1998 ) .",
    "a modest number of ces are seen in more distant clusters , such as abell 496 ( chilingarian et al . 2005 ) and abell 1689 ( mieske et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the structural properties of ces are reminiscent of larger classical elliptical galaxies ( e.g wirth & gallagher 1984 ) .",
    "indeed , ces fall along the low brightness end of the trend defined by classical elliptical galaxies on the m@xmath7  @xmath8 and r@xmath9  @xmath8 planes . given their modest brightnesses and the nature of these trends ,",
    "the structural properties of ces are thus ` extreme ' when compared with more massive elliptical galaxies , in the sense of having comparatively high central surface brightnesses ( @xmath10 ) and small effective radii ( log(r@xmath11 ) .",
    "various ce formation mechanisms have been examined in the literature , and most of these involve the tidal stripping of a progenitor galaxy .",
    "faber ( 1973 ) suggested that ces may be the remnant cores of ellipticals that have had their outer regions removed .",
    "nieto & prugniel ( 1987 ) propose a variation of this idea , in which the progenitors of ces are a special type of low mass high central surface brightness elliptical that have been stripped of their outer envelopes , although candidate progenitors have not yet been discovered .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that m32 is the remnant bulge of a ` threshed ' disk galaxy , and evidence for a residual disk has been found ( graham 2002 ; choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 ) .",
    "the bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model has the merit of explaining the paucity of ces , as they only form in a small region of parameter space .",
    "it should be noted that tidal stripping is not the only process that has been considered to form ces , and burkert ( 1994 ) describes how a high central surface brightness galaxy may form in close proximity to a much larger galaxy .",
    "the characterization of stellar populations within galaxies , especially in their central regions where supermassive black holes are often found and signatures of recent star formation may also be present , provide information that is essential for probing the origins and evolution of these objects . in the current paper ,",
    "the radial distribution of the brightest evolved stars in the central arcsec of the three closest ces ",
    "m32 , ngc 4486b , and ngc 5846a  is investigated .",
    "the data are unique in that they were obtained with an integral field spectrograph at near - infrared wavelengths , and have an angular resolution approaching the diffraction limit of an 8 meter telescope .",
    "while ces share common structural properties , there are substantial galaxy - to - galaxy differences in their stellar contents .",
    "as one of the closest and brightest galaxies in the sky , m32 has been the subject of numerous spectroscopic and photometric investigations .",
    "there is spectroscopic evidence of an intermediate age population both at visible ( e.g. oconnell 1980 ; rose 1985 ; bica , alloin , & schmidt 1990 ; del burgo et al .",
    "2001 ) and near - infrared ( davidge 1990 ) wavelengths .",
    "studies of the resolved stellar content of m32 also reveal signs of an intermediate age component , in that the most luminous agb stars have photometric properties that are indicative of an age of a few gyr ( e.g. freedman 1992 ; elston & silva 1992 ; davidge 2000 ; davidge & jensen 2007 ) .",
    "still , there is some disagreement between the analysis of the resolved stellar content and predictions made from integrated light spectroscopy .",
    "davidge & jensen ( 2007 ) find that the brightest agb stars in m32 are uniformly mixed throughout the galaxy , and this is contrary to what might be expected based on the radial gradients in age and metallicity that were found by rose et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and worthey ( 2004 ) in their investigation of visible wavelength spectra .",
    "the stellar content of ngc 4486b differs from that of m32 in that the strengths of absorption features in the visible light spectrum of ngc 4486b are consistent with those of an old , metal - rich system ( sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2006b , hereafter sgcg ) .",
    "in addition , the absorption features in the visible spectrum of ngc 4486b are indicative of a metallicity gradient with a slope that is similar to those in classical elliptical galaxies ( sanchez - blazquez , gorgas , & cardiel 2006 , hereafter sgc ) , whereas the metallicity gradient in m32 is much shallower ( e.g. worthey 2004 ; sgc ) .",
    "there is also evidence for a comparatively steep age gradient in ngc 4486b when compared with other ellipticals ( sgc ) , opening the possibility that an intermediate age component like that in m32 might await discovery near the center of ngc 4486b .",
    "ngc 4486b harbours a double nucleus ( lauer et al . 1996 ) , and there is kinematic evidence for a central super - massive black hole ( kormendy et al .",
    "1997 ) . adopting the black hole mass estimated by kormendy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , then the ratio of central black hole to total bulge mass in ngc 4486b is larger than what is seen in other elliptical galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "one possible explanation of such a result is that ngc 4486b may once have been a more massive galaxy , but that the outer regions were stripped away , presumably by interactions with the much larger ngc 4486 . the amount of material that would have to be stripped from the ngc 4486b progenitor in such a scenario is substantial .",
    "if the progenitor of ngc 4486b had a central black hole mass that fell along the trend between black hole mass and spheroid ( ` bulge ' ) mass that is defined by other systems , then the progenitor spheroid must have been between one and two orders of magnitude more massive than is presently seen .",
    "still , the mass of the central object in ngc 4486b is uncertain , and soria et al .",
    "( 2006a ) argue for a black hole mass that is an order of magnitude lower than that computed by kormendy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 5846a has not been as extensively studied as m32 or ngc 4486b , probably because it is more distant .",
    "still , ngc 5846a shares some similarities with ngc 4486b . like ngc 4486b , ngc 5846a is a companion to a much larger galaxy , which in turn is the largest member of a group that is dominated by early - type galaxies ( mahdavi , trentham , & tully 2005 ) . as in ngc 4486b ,",
    "the absorption lines at visible wavelengths in the integrated spectrum of ngc 5846a have strengths that are indicative of an old , metal - rich system ( sgcg ) , and there is a metallicity gradient that is similar to those in classical ellipticals ( sgc ) .",
    "the age gradient in ngc 5846a is shallower than that in ngc 4486b , but is still typical of that seen in other ellipticals ( sgc ) .",
    "the spectra that have been used previously to probe the stellar contents of m32 , ngc 4486b , and ngc 5846a were typically recorded with ground - based telescopes during natural seeing conditions , and so have angular resolutions that are on the order of an arcsec .",
    "observations with higher angular resolution are desireable to probe the central regions of these galaxies , where young or intermediate age populations might lurk .",
    "the use of adaptive optics ( ao ) systems on ground - based 8 metre telescopes can produce a substantial gain in angular resolution over what can be achieved without wavefront correction . in the current study ,",
    "ao - corrected spectra of m32 , ngc 4486b , and ngc 5846a in the @xmath12 m wavelength region are used to examine the stellar content of the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "the integrated light near @xmath13 m in old and all but the youngest of intermediate age systems is dominated by first ascent giants ( e.g. frogel et al .",
    "1978 ; maraston 2005 ) . given that the photometric properties of giants are sensitive to age and metallicity then spectroscopic observations in the @xmath12 m interval are potentially useful for investigating population gradients .",
    "various properties of the three ces are listed in table 1 .",
    "the quantities listed for each galaxy are the distance modulus ( second column ) , the absolute @xmath0band magnitude ( third column ) , the radius at which the surface brightness reaches 25 mag arcsec@xmath14 in @xmath15 ( fourth column ) , and the central velocity dispersion measured in a 0.1 arcsec radius aperture ( fifth column ) . for homogeneity ,",
    "the distance moduli are those measured by tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from surface brightness flucuations .",
    "the absolute brightnesses were measured from images in the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , while the isophotal radii are from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the velocity dispersions were measured from the data discussed here (  4 ) .",
    "the spectra were recorded with nifs on gemini north .",
    "the wavefront incident to nifs was corrected by the altair ao system , and the resulting signal at the nifs image plane has an angular resolution of @xmath2 arcsec .",
    "the resulting spatial resolution of these data spans a broad range . in m32",
    "the spatial resolution is 0.4 parsecs , whereas in ngc 4486b the spatial resolution is @xmath16 parsecs and in ngc 5846a it is @xmath17 parsecs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "details of the observations and the techniques used to reduce the data are discussed in  2 .",
    "the angular resolution of the data and a preliminary galaxy - to - galaxy comparison of the @xmath0band spectra are the subjects of  3 .",
    "a quantitative investigation of the stellar content using line indices , including an investigation of radial trends in stellar content , is carried out in  4 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  5 .",
    "the spectra of all three galaxies were recorded with nifs@xmath1altair on gemini north ( gn ) .",
    "nifs ( mcgregor et al . 2003 ) , is an integral field spectrograph that covers the @xmath18 m wavelength interval .",
    "the science detector is a @xmath19 hawaii-2rg hgcdte array .",
    "a contiguous @xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 area on the sky is sampled with 29 slitlets , each of which subtends a @xmath22 arcsec@xmath21 area ; the direction perpendicular to the dispersion axis has an angular scale of 0.04 arcsec pixel@xmath23 , and the spectral dispersion is 5300 .",
    "altair ( herriot et al . 2000 ) is the facility ao system on gn .",
    "prior to 2006 , altair used natural guide stars ( ngss ) exclusively as reference beacons for ao correction , and the m32 data were recorded in this mode , with the bright semi - stellar galaxy nucleus serving as the ngs .",
    "this mode could not be employed for ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a as the nucleus of each galaxy is too faint and too diffuse to serve as a ngs . moreover , both galaxies are at moderately high galactic latitudes , and there are no stars of a suitable brightness that are close enough on the sky to serve as ngss .",
    "therefore , the observations of ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a were obtained using laser guide stars ( lgss ) , which is a capability that has recently been commissioned on gn ( boccas et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "when using artificial reference beacons it is necessary to monitor the tip / tilt ( t / t ) component of the incident wavefront with a natural guide source near the science target .",
    "while the nuclei of ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a are not suitable for use as ngss for high - order ao correction , they can be used as t / t reference sources .",
    "this is possible since the inherently low angular resolution of the four element t / t wavefront sensor ( wfs ) in altair makes it more stable when guiding on faint , extended sources than the higher - order ngs wfs .",
    "the data were recorded over two observing seasons .",
    "the altair field lens , which moves the conjugatation point for ao correction from a fixed altitude above the summit of mauna kea to the primary mirror of the telescope , was deployed for these observations , as the use of this lens significantly reduces anisoplanicity .",
    "the m32 spectra were obtained on the night of october 23 , 2005 as part of the nifs commissioning program .",
    "the observations of ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a were recorded as part of programs gn2006b - sv-103 and gn2007a - dd-6 .",
    "the spectra of ngc 4486b used in this paper were obtained on the night of february 6 , 2007 , while the observations of ngc 5846a were recorded on june 1 , 2007 .",
    "six 600 sec exposures were recorded of m32 , while eight 85 sec exposures were recorded of ngc 4486b and fourteen 85 sec exposures were recorded of ngc 5846a .",
    "each galaxy observation was paired with that of a blank sky field , which was recorded either immediately before or after the galaxy observation .",
    "at least one telluric standard star observation was made either immediately before or after the galaxy observations on a given night . in the case of ngc 4486b and",
    "ngc 5846a , the telluric standard was observed with the lgs ao system activated so that the corrected image quality could be assessed .",
    "a modest sample of bright spectroscopic / radial velocity standard stars were also observed as part of program gn2006b - sv-103 .",
    "the telluric and spectroscopic standard stars are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the first step in the data reduction sequence was to subtract the sky spectra from the corresponding galaxy exposures , and the results were divided by a flat - field frame .",
    "cosmic rays were identified using a routine that identified pixels with intensities that greatly differed from those of the surroundings .",
    "the intensities of the pixels that were found to contain cosmic rays were set to the median of the surrounding pixels .",
    "the flat - fielded data were wavelength calibrated using observations of an ar arc , which were recorded during each night .",
    "the wavelength - calibrated spectra for each galaxy were then summed , and the combined spectra were divided by the spectrum of the appropriate telluric standard star . with the exception of br@xmath24 ,",
    "the spectra of the telluric standard stars are largely free of photospheric absorption lines .",
    "the br@xmath24 line was removed from the telluric spectra using the interactive line - fitting and subtraction routine in the iraf routine splot .",
    "the angular resolution of these data is an important issue when considering the spectroscopic characteristics of the central regions of the target galaxies . to monitor the intrinsic seeing ,",
    "the telluric standard stars that were observed as part of the ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a data sets were recorded with the lgs ao system activated .",
    "the psfs obtained from the telluric star observations are centrally concentrated , with a fwhm @xmath2 arcsec . at 0.2 arcsec radius",
    "the psf drops to @xmath25 of the peak value , while at 0.4 arcsec radius the psf is only @xmath26 of the peak value .",
    "there is crosstalk between the spatial elements in integral field spectrographs because of ( 1 ) the size of the source being studied , which includes contributions not only from the intrinsic angular extent of the object , but also from seeing and the telescope optics , and ( 2 ) the optics within the spectrograph .",
    "the issue of slitlet - to - slitlet scatter was investigated using the light profiles of the telluric standard stars that were observed with altair activated .",
    "if the nifs optics introduce significant slitlet - to - slitlet scattering then the fwhm of the stellar profile measured along the central slitlet will be narrower than the fwhm measured perpendicular to this direction .",
    "the light profile of the telluric standard stars measured between slitlets is not wider than that measured along the central slitlet , indicating that the ao - corrected psf is the dominant contributor to crosstalk between nifs slitlets for sources with fwhm = 0.1 arcsec .",
    "the nature of ao - corrected point spread functions ( psfs ) depends on environmental conditions and the properties of the t / t source .",
    "the image quality of the galaxy observations can be assessed in a manner that accounts for these factors by comparing the ao - corrected light profiles of the galaxies with those obtained using the hst . to enable such a comparison ,",
    "light profiles were constructed for each galaxy by integrating the two dimensional spectra between rest frame wavelengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 m , and the results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "all profiles plotted in this figure have been normalized to the peak value .",
    "two of the galaxies in our sample have published light profiles based on hst data .",
    "the dashed line in the top panel of figure 1 is the f475w light profile of ngc 4486b from ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and there is remarkable agreement with the nifs data .",
    "thus , the angular resolution of the ngc 4486b nifs data are comparable to that obtained with the hst at visible wavelengths .",
    "the dashed line in the lower panel of figure 1 is the f222 m light profile for m32 plotted in figure 8 of corbin , oneil , & rieke ( 2001 ) .",
    "the nicmos data have an angular resolution @xmath29 arcsec .",
    "the altair observations are significantly narrower than the hst data when @xmath30 arcsec , indicating that the current data has a higher angular resolution than was acheived with nicmos .",
    "ngc 5846a has the most compact light profile in our sample .",
    "unfortunately , we are not aware of extant high angular resolution images of this galaxy . still , given that the light profile has a width of @xmath31 arcsec , the nifs observations of ngc 5846a likely have an angular resolution that is comparable to , or possibly even better than , that of the ngc 4486b data .",
    "the visible wavelength spectra of m32 , ngc 4486b , and ngc 5846a show distinct differences , in the sense that m32 has deeper h@xmath32 and shallower mgb absorption than the other galaxies .",
    "this in turn indicates that these galaxies have different stellar contents ( e.g. sgcg ) .",
    "this being the case , then how do the spectra of these galaxies compare in the near - infrared , where the integrated light is dominated by stars that are very different from those that contribute significantly at visible wavelengths ? the first overtone @xmath3co band heads are the most prominent features in the near - infrared spectra of old and intermediate age populations , and so are potentially prime diagnostics of stellar content .",
    "the depths of these features have been modelled previously , and they are predicted to be sensitive to population parameters ( e.g. figure 11 of vazquez , carigi , & gonzalez 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 m spectrum of the central arcsec of each galaxy , which is the approximate seeing disk during ` typical ' ground - based observing conditions , is shown in figure 2 . also plotted",
    "are the spectra of the k5iii star hr 4801 and the m0iii star hr 4884 .",
    "a low - order continuum has been divided out of each spectrum .",
    "the vertical axis in figure 2 shows intensity in a linear scale , and the spectra have been shifted vertically to facilitate comparisons .",
    "the random and systematic motions of stars broaden absorption lines in the integrated spectra of galaxies , and spectra should be smoothed to a common kinematic broadening before making comparisons . to allow this to be done",
    ", a velocity dispersion and radial velocity were measured for each spectrum using the tonry & davis ( 1979 ) cross - correlation routine .",
    "the velocity dispersions measured within 0.1 arcsec radius of the galaxy centers are listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in these measurements are roughly @xmath33 km sec@xmath23 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the entries in this table are based on the widths of the absorption features averaged over a 0.1 arcsec radius , and thus reflect contributions from both the random _ and _ rotational motions of stars in this region of each galaxy .",
    "the rotational component will contribute to the line widths , and smaller dispersions would be found had the spectra not been radially averaged , but instead restricted to the dynamical axes of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath34 entry for m32 in the last column of table 1 is consistent with that measured by joseph et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from stis spectra .",
    "the results in that paper predict a total line broadening of @xmath35 km sec@xmath23 in a 0.1 arcsec radius region centered on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this agrees with the entry for this galaxy in table 1 , and so there is not a significant difference with the nifs data .",
    "spectra with moderately high angular resolution are also available for ngc 4486b .",
    "kormendy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath36 km sec@xmath23 near the center of ngc 4486b , and this is 30 km sec@xmath23 lower than that found here . while the difference is larger than the estimated uncertainty in the nifs measurements , the kormendy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) data have an angular resolution of @xmath37 arcsec , compared with @xmath2 arcsec for the nifs data .",
    "the spectra plotted in figure 2 have been gaussian smoothed to match the velocity dispersion in the central regions of ngc 4486b , which has the highest velocity dispersion in the data ( table 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath3co band heads in m32 are weaker than in the other galaxies , having a depth that is slightly shallower than in the k5iii star .",
    "the depths of the na i , fe i , and ca i features in m32 are also weaker than in the other galaxies , but are comparable to those in the k5iii spectrum .",
    "the spectra of ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a are similar , as might be expected based on the ages and metallicities of these galaxies inferred from visible wavelength spectra ( e.g. sgcg ) .",
    "still , the @xmath3co band heads are slightly deeper in ngc 5846a .",
    "this difference in line strength can be attributed  at least in part  to differences in the radial distributions of populations in the innermost regions of these galaxies (  4 ) .",
    "spectra were extracted in 0.1 arcsec wide annuli .",
    "the 0.1 arcsec width matches the angular resolution of the data while also allowing the extracted spectra to have reasonably high signal - to - noise ratios . a velocity dispersion and a radial velocity were measured for each extracted spectrum .",
    "the velocity dispersion measures the line broadening caused by the random and systematic motions of stars in each annulus .",
    "given that the extracted spectra sample annuli , as opposed to the kinematic axes , the velocity measurements are not suitable for a kinematic study ; rather , they simply provide the empirical measure of line width that is needed to produce spectra with a common intrinsic resolution .    to create spectra from which a homogeneous set of line strengths could be obtained",
    ", the extracted spectra were convolved with gaussians so that the results had line broadenings that matched those in the central regions of ngc 4486b .",
    "the standard deviation of the gaussian that was applied to each extracted spectrum was computed from the velocity dispersion measurements discussed above .",
    "the equivalent widths of na i , ca i , and @xmath3co ( 2,0 ) absorption features were measured in the broadened spectra using the continuum and line bandpasses defined by ramirez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "two other indices were measured .",
    "silva , kuntschner , & lyubenova ( 2007 ) define indices that sample fe i transitions , and the results are averaged to produce the @xmath5 index .",
    "in addition , the @xmath4co(2,0 ) band head is seen in the spectra , and the equivalent width of this feature was measured using the bandpasses listed in table 3 .",
    "the @xmath4co(2,0 ) band head is located in the wings of the much stronger @xmath3co(4,2 ) feature , and the continuum passbands in table 3 measure only a local pseudo - equivalent width .",
    "hence , the @xmath4co(2,0 ) index defined here is only a relative measure of the strength of this feature .",
    "the impact of kinematic broadening on the line indices was assessed by convolving the standard star spectra with a gaussian to simulate the velocity smearing near the center of ngc 4486b . smoothing to match the kinematic properties of stars in the central regions of the ce galaxies has a substantial impact on the visual appearance of the stellar spectra .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 3 , where the unsmoothed and smoothed spectra of the m0iii giant hr 4884 are compared .",
    "the absorption features in the smoothed spectrum are heavily blurred , and the complex of lines near the na i and ca i features each form a single broad trough in the smoothed spectrum .",
    "we gauge the impact of velocity broadening on line indices with the statistic c(@xmath38 ) , which is the ratio of a line index measured from an unbroadened spectrum to that measured after applying a broadening function to simulate a velocity dispersion @xmath38 ( e.g. davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "the c(@xmath39 ) values measured for the k1iii star hr4793 and the m0iii star hr 4884 , where @xmath40 is the central velocity dispersion of ngc 4486b , are shown in table 4 for the na i , ca i , @xmath3co ( 2,0 ) , and @xmath5 indices ; the impact of velocity smearing was not investigated for the @xmath4co index , since ( 1 ) the passbands were defined from spectra that were already velocity broadened , and ( 2 ) this index is not compared here with measurements made in other studies .",
    "indices corresponding to a null velocity dispersion can be obtained by multiplying the values given in this study by the entries in table 3 .",
    "the c(@xmath38 ) entries in table 4 are similar to those shown in figure 8 of silva et al . ( 2007 ) for a velocity dispersion of 330 km sec@xmath23 .",
    "the na i and ca i line indices sample the strengths of transitions from more than one element , and this complicates the sensitivities of the indices to chemical abundance .",
    "such contamination is common among line indices at visible wavelengths ( e.g. worthey et al .",
    "in addition to na lines , the na i index also includes significant si absorption , although silva et al .",
    "( 2007 ) point out that both na and si are expected to be super metal - rich in early - type galaxies , and this should at least partially mitigate the impact of contamination on the na i index .",
    "contamination is of greater potential concern for the ca i index , where transitions due to s , si , ti , sc , and fe are present in addition to those of ca .",
    "these elements have diverse chemical enrichment pedigrees , thereby complicating the interpretation of the ca i index .",
    "age is another parameter that might affect the indices .",
    "the depth of h@xmath32 is sensitive to the brightness of the main sequence turn - off , and galaxies that fall above the relations defined by old systems on the h@xmath32[mgfe ] plane are thought to have a young stellar component .",
    "silva et al . ( 2007 ) find that galaxies that fall well above the old galaxy relation on the h@xmath32[mgfe ] plane also fall well away from the old sequence on the na i[mgfe ] diagram .",
    "strong na i absorption thus appears to be linked to strong h@xmath32 absorption , and so ` aging ' a system to predict the line indices that might be expected many gyr in the future if there is no further star formation shifts the na i index to smaller values .",
    "silva et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that this behaviour is due to the presence of an extended giant branch , made up of agb stars , in younger systems .",
    "the location of all three galaxies on the h@xmath32[mgfe ] diagram were examined using the indices measured by sanchez - blazquez , gorgas , cardiel , & gonzalez ( 2006a ) to determine if age should be considered when interpreting the near - infrared indices .",
    "ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a fall in a part of the diagram indicating that they are old systems , while m32 falls well above this relation . the na i index measurements of m32 will thus have to be adjusted for age affects . in  5",
    "it is argued that age may also affect the na i indices in the central few tenths of an arcsec of ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a , which is a region that contributes only a modest fraction of the total signal to the sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "( 2006a ) observations .",

    "what mechanism can explain such a radial behaviour in the near - infrared line indices ?",
    "the location of ngc 4486b on the h@xmath32[mgfe ] diagram and the analysis by sgcn indicates that a young population does not dominate this galaxy on arcsec scales , and so the na i and @xmath5 indices in the outer regions of the nifs data are probably not affected by age .",

    "this is one of the steepest age gradients in the sgc sample , and opens the possibility that there could be an intermediate age population near the center of ngc 4486b .",
    "the radial behaviour of two of the near - infrared indices support the notion that the central regions of ngc 4486b harbour intermediate age stars .",
    "first , the @xmath5 index is a potentially powerful age indicator in galaxies that are dominated by metal - rich stars , as there is no metallicity sensitivity ( silva et al .",

    "second , the @xmath3co(2,0 ) index in the innermost regions of ngc 4486b are also smaller than at large radii , with an equivalent width that is similar to that near the center of m32 .",
    "models of simple stellar systems predict that the first overtone co bands will grow in strength as a system ages when age exceeds 2 gyr ( e.g. figure 11 of vazquez et al . 2003 ) .",
    "based on the presence of a steep age gradient inferred from spectra at visible wavelengths , and the radial behaviour of the @xmath5 and @xmath3co indices , we suggest that the nuclear regions of ngc 4486b contain an intermediate age population .",
    "this possibility can be tested using space - based observations , where high angular resolution observations can be obtained at visible and blue wavelengths .",
    "if a young or intermediate age population is present in the nuclear regions of ngc 4486b then such data should show deeper balmer absorption lines than at large radii .",

    "therefore , it is worth considering other mechanisms that might create spectroscopic gradients near the center of ngc 4486b .",

    "( 2000 ) , then it appears that large quantities of cold gas have not been present in the ngc 5846 @xmath1 ngc 5846a system for a large fraction of the age of the universe . still , while the bulk of ngc 5846a has an old age , sgn measure an age gradient @xmath50log(t)/@xmath50log(r ) @xmath79 , and so the central regions might harbour stars that are younger than those at large radii .",
    "the comparison in figure 6 suggests that the radial distribution of stellar content in ngc 5846a is similar to that in ngc 4486b , where the near - infrared indices suggest that a central intermediate age population is present . as with ngc 4486b",
    ", it would be interesting to obtain high angular resolution spectra of ngc 5846a at visible wavelengths to search for evidence of a nuclear enhancement in balmer absorption line strengths , although the larger distance of ngc 5846a will make it more challenging to detect a nucleated young population than in ngc 4486b .",
