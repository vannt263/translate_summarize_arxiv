    "reactions involving @xmath1 particles and intermediate - to - heavy mass nuclides often can play an important role in nucleosynthesis occurring in massive stars at high temperatures and in explosive environments such as supernovae @xcite .",
    "for example , accurate rates for many ( @xmath5,@xmath1 ) reactions are needed for a better understanding of the nucleosynthesis of the neutron deficient @xmath6 90 nuclides during the so - called _ p _ process . as important as these reactions are , there is scant experimental information on their rates because the cross sections are extremely small and many of the required `` target '' isotopes have very small natural abundances ( and hence are very expensive ) or are radioactive ; thus , direct measurements are very difficult . however , most of the required rates should be calculable to sufficient accuracy using the nuclear statistical model , but these theoretical calculations are , at present , hampered by large uncertainties in the @xmath1+nucleus potential in the astrophysically relevant energy range .",
    "we recently @xcite have shown that ( _ n_,@xmath1 ) cross section measurements on intermediate - to - heavy mass nuclides offer perhaps the best means for constraining the many parameters defining a realistic @xmath7+nucleus potential .",
    "although this approach is showing great promise , one drawback is that the comparison between theory and experiment as cross sections involves sensitivity to other model parameters in addition to the @xmath7+nucleus potential .",
    "a more direct comparison of @xmath1 strength functions extracted from the measurements to theoretical expectations should avoid these confounding dependencies and allow greater insight into possible improvements in the model .",
    "@xmath0sm appears to be the best candidate for such a study for several reasons .",
    "first , the q - value for @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath1 ) is fairly large so the cross section , although still very small , is expected to be among the largest in this mass range .",
    "second , the natural abundance of @xmath8sm is fairly large so the necessary isotopically enriched sample is affordable . third , unlike several other potential candidates , there is relatively complete information on the parameters for the 100 lowest - energy resonances .",
    "this is important because reliably extracting @xmath1 widths requires reasonably complete knowledge of the neutron and @xmath9 widths for the resonances , and comparison to theory is most meaningful if the spins and parities of the resonances are known .",
    "for _ s_-wave neutrons incident on @xmath0sm ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances can be formed in the compound nucleus @xmath13sm .",
    "the @xmath1 widths for several @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath1 ) resonances for @xmath3 @xmath4 700 ev were determined in previous measurements kv70,po72,ba76,an80,an84  of this cross section , and these data were compared to statistical model predictions .",
    "however , these comparisons were hampered by the fact that the @xmath1 widths for most of the resonances in this region could not be measured .",
    "we have employed an improved detector to make a new measurement of the @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath1 ) cross section .",
    "in addition to extending the range of the measurements to much higher energies , this new detector resulted in a much improved signal - to - noise ratio in the resolved resonance region so that the @xmath1 widths for most of the resonances in this region could be extracted from the data .",
    "this much improved @xmath1-width information makes possible a more meaningful comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "the experiment has been described elsewhere @xcite , so only the salient features will be given here .",
    "the measurements were made at the oak ridge electron linear accelerator ( orela ) @xcite white neutron source .",
    "the orela was operated at a repetition rate of 525 hz , a power of 6  8 kw and a pulse width of 8 ns .",
    "a 0.76-mm thick cd filter was used to eliminate the overlap of slow neutrons from previous pulses and a 1.27-cm thick pb filter was used to help reduce overload effects from the @xmath14 flash at the start of each neutron pulse .",
    "neutron energies were measured via time - of - flight .",
    "the detector was a compensated ionization chamber ( cic ) @xcite .",
    "although a cic can have poorer pulse - height resolution than , for example , a gridded ionization chamber , it reduces overload effects due to the @xmath9 flash at the start of each neutron pulse by several orders of magnitude , allowing measurements to be made with excellent signal - to - noise ratio to much higher neutron energies ( 500 kev in the present case ) .    the source - to - sample distance was 8.835 m and the neutron beam was collimated to 10 cm in diameter at the sample position .",
    "two samples were placed back - to - back in the center of our parallel - plate cic with the planes of the samples perpendicular to the neutron beam .",
    "hence , the cross section was measured over nearly the entire 4@xmath15 solid angle .",
    "the samples were in the form of sm@xmath16o@xmath17 enriched to 95.3% in @xmath0sm and were 5.0 mg/@xmath18 thick by 11 cm in diameter .",
    "the @xmath19li(_n_,@xmath20h reaction was used to measure the energy dependence of the flux and to normalize the raw counts to absolute cross section .",
    "these measurements were made during a run when one of the @xmath0sm samples was replaced by a @xmath21li sample .",
    "the neutron energy scale also was calibrated during this run using dips in the time - of - flight spectrum caused by resonances in the cd filter and al vacuum windows in the flight path as well as the peak due to the 244.5-kev resonance from the @xmath19li(_n_,@xmath1)@xmath22h reaction .",
    "a @xmath19li sample in a separate parallel - plate cic was used as a flux monitor .",
    "the most recent endf evaluation  @xcite  for the @xmath19li(_n_,@xmath23h reaction was used in calculating the absolute cross sections .",
    "the data were corrected for the small background due to the spontaneous @xmath1 decay of @xmath0sm and for the effects of @xmath1 straggling in the samples . this latter correction ( 14% )",
    "was calculated using the computer code srim @xcite .",
    "the overall normalization uncertainty of approximately 6% is dominated by the uncertainty ( @xmath24 4% ) in this correction and by uncertainties ( @xmath24 3% ) in the sample sizes .",
    "the data were fitted with the @xmath2-matrix code sammy @xcite to extract the @xmath1 widths for resonances in the resolved region below 700 ev . almost all",
    "observed @xcite resonances in this energy range have been assigned @xcite as @xmath11 or @xmath25 ( _ s_-wave ) .",
    "a radius of 8.3 fm was used in all @xmath0sm channels .",
    "both the fact that the sample was an oxide and the aluminum backing were included in the input files for sammy so that corrections could be applied for attenuation and multiple - scattering effects in the sample and its backing .",
    "the resonance energies , spins , parities , and neutron and @xmath9 widths from the compilation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are based mainly on the work of refs .",
    "@xcite , were used as starting values in the analysis .",
    "only a few of the energies had to be adjusted , and one ( tentative ) spin assignment ( for the 659.4-ev resonance ) was changed to fit the data . a radiation width equal to the average for @xmath0sm resonances ( 69 mev ref .",
    "@xcite ) was used for resonances without @xmath26 values in ref .",
    "the resulting parameters are given in table sm147restable where , for example , 1.273 _ ( 61 ) _ is used to denote 1.273@xmath240.061 , etc .",
    "representative plots of the data and @xmath2-matrix fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ rmatrixfitsfig ] .",
    ".@xmath0sm(@xmath27 ) resonance parameters .",
    "[ sm147restable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as can be seen , the calculated strength functions in the neutron channel are about a factor of two larger than experiment for both @xmath28 and @xmath25 resonances .",
    "it is interesting to note that the standard non - smoker rau00 level spacings ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ev for @xmath31 and @xmath32 resonances , respectively ) are about a factor of two smaller than the measured ones ; hence , the calculated average neutron widths are in fairly good agreement with the measured values .",
    "this illustrates the importance of making the comparison between theory and experiment as strength functions , for if instead average widths were compared , the confounding influence of the level spacing might lead one to conclude that there was better agreement between theory and experiment than there actually is .    for potential p1 ,",
    "in the @xmath33 ev range , the calculated @xmath25 @xmath7 strength function is about a factor of two larger than measured , but the calculated @xmath1 strength function for @xmath11 is in more serious disagreement ( a factor of about 6 larger ) with experiment . in the @xmath34 ev range ,",
    "the @xmath25 @xmath1 strength function calculated with potential p1 is in good agreement with the data , but for @xmath35 resonances the @xmath1 strength function is in even more serious disagreement ( about a factor of 17 ) than it was in the lower - energy region .",
    "potential p2 is clearly better than p1 in predicting the @xmath1 strength function for @xmath28 resonances and for @xmath25 resonances in the @xmath36 ev region .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ avgalstrfunrat ] , both potentials strongly overpredict the @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath1 strength function ratio , potential p2 yielding a ratio only slightly smaller than that calculated with potential p1 .    these comparisons as strength functions indicate that the optical @xmath1+@xmath37nd potential requires more adjustment than would be surmised from comparisons as cross sections .",
    "however , it should be noted that the cross - section comparisons were made at higher energies ( @xmath38 kev ) where contributions from _",
    "p_-wave resonances are expected to become more important .",
    "furthermore , the disagreement between calculated and actual strength functions might become smaller at higher energies as has been found in other reactions .",
    "nevertheless , it is informative that both the calculated neutron and @xmath1 strength functions are too large - a fact that could not be surmised from comparisons as @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath39)@xmath40nd cross sections .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ avgalstrfunrat ] , the ratio of the calculated @xmath1 strength functions for the two _ s_-wave spin states is constant over the energy range of resonance analysis .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the measurements which show a steep decrease in this ratio above @xmath41 ev .",
    "regardless of the potential used , it will never be possible to achieve such an abrupt change in the ratio within an optical model of strength functions .",
    "however , it is possible that the abrupt change in the @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath7 strength function ratio is due to incorrect spin assignments above @xmath42 ev . therefore , it is interesting to study if calculations can reproduce the measured ratio below @xmath41 ev where the data should be very reliable .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from a more systematic variation of the parameters of a saxon - woods @xmath1 potential which we attempted .",
    "firstly , the absolute values of the strength functions are far more sensitive to the potential than is the @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath1 strength function ratio . trying to reduce to calculated ratio by only the smaller amount needed to reproduce",
    "the measured ratio in the region below @xmath41 ev quickly leads to strength functions which are orders of magnitude larger than the observed ones ( and hence also to an inferior description of the cross section ) .",
    "secondly , it is impossible to obtain a @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath7 strength function ratio smaller than unity with any saxon - woods potential . in consequence",
    ", it is impossible to reproduce the small ratio observed above @xmath41 ev with any such calculation .",
    "thus , from this analysis it appears that a @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath1 strength function ratio smaller than unity may be an additional indication of a non - statistical effect in the data .    finally , the non - smoker calculation predicts that 78% of the @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath1)@xmath40nd cross section is given by transitions from 3@xmath43 states , 12% from 4@xmath44 states , and 10% from other states ( higher partial waves ) . of the 3@xmath44 transitions ,",
    "67% directly populate the ground state of @xmath40nd , which can not be reached from 4@xmath44 resonances .",
    "new measurements in which the various @xmath1 groups are resolved would be very useful for testing these predictions .",
    "the relative contributions of the various transitions also shows why it is more important for cross section predictions to reproduce the @xmath28 tcs than the @xmath28 to @xmath25  ratio .",
    "therefore , potential p2 , which has essentially the same @xmath28 to @xmath25ratio as potential p1 but comes much closer to reproducing the 3@xmath44 tcs , yields a cross section in better agreement with the measurements .",
    "comparing theory to experiment as @xmath1 strength functions rather than as @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath1 ) cross sections avoids confounding effects due to the neutron and gamma channels , level densities , and width fluctuation corrections and therefore can reveal more useful information about possible improvements to theoretical models by isolating effects due to the @xmath1+nucleus potential .",
    "furthermore , separating the data into the two possible _",
    "s_-wave spin states may yield even more information about the @xmath1+nucleus potential , because @xmath1 particles from @xmath35 resonances have ( on average ) larger energies than those from @xmath25 resonances and hence they sample a different region of the @xmath1+nucleus potential .",
    "therefore , differences between the measured and calculated @xmath7 strength functions for the two different _",
    "s_-wave spin states should be useful for future improvements in the @xmath1+nucleus potential",
    ". an improved @xmath1+nucleus potential would be very useful for astrophysical applications .",
    "interestingly , it is clear from the data presented in fig . sm147gagn0andggvse that the extracted @xmath1 widths exhibit fluctuations different from the expected behavior and hint at possible non - statistical effects .",
    "one striking feature is that the @xmath1 widths exhibit peaks and/or regions of large fluctuations as a function of neutron energy instead of the expected random fluctuations intermediate to that for neutron and @xmath9 widths .",
    "perhaps these peaks are a manifestation of a nuclear structure effect in the @xmath13sm compound nucleus that is not observable in decay channels other than the @xmath1 channel .",
    "one important difference between the decay of the @xmath13sm compound nucleus into the @xmath7 channel compared to decay into the neutron or @xmath9 channels is the large coulomb barrier that the @xmath1 particles must overcome .",
    "hence , it is possible that the coulomb barrier for @xmath1 decay could act as a lever arm enhancing the signature of nuclear structure effects that are too subtle to be observed in other channels .",
    "for example , @xmath1 decay could be enhanced for compound states with significant deformation and for @xmath45 states of significant collectivity ( because they decay mainly to the @xmath46 first excited state of @xmath40nd ) .",
    "further evidence for possible non - statistical behavior of the @xmath1 widths is revealed when the resonances are separated according to spin as shown in figs .",
    "[ cumualphandneutwidfig ] through [ avgalstrfunrat ] .",
    "the striking disagreement with theoretical expectations shown in these figures depends on reliable spin assignments for the resonances .",
    "the spin assignments used in these figures rely on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the good match between the energy scale for this reference and our work , and the crude pulse - height information from our experiment for resonances having large @xmath1 widths .",
    "below approximately 300 ev , the spin assignments used herein should be very reliable .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting that our exploratory calculations show that , even in this energy range , it is not possible to reproduce the observed @xmath1 strength functions as well as the @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath1 strength ratio at the same time using a saxon - woods potential .",
    "the @xmath1-width distributions shown in figs . [ cumualphandneutwidfig ] and [ ptdistalandneutfig ] , as well as the striking change in the @xmath28 to @xmath25 @xmath1 strength ratio near 300 ev shown in fig .",
    "avgalstrfunrat depend on reliable spin assignments above 300 ev .",
    "for a number of reasons , the spin assignments in this region may not be as reliable , so it would be very useful to make new @xmath0sm(_n_,@xmath7 ) measurements with thinner samples to check spin assignments , especially for those resonances having the largest @xmath1 widths . in such measurements ,",
    "resonances having visible @xmath47 groups to the ground state of @xmath40nd unambiguously could be assigned as @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath1-particle spectra for the few resonances below @xmath48 ev that have been reported @xcite are in agreement with the accepted @xcite spin assignments , except possibly the 58.130-ev resonance ( 57.9 ev in ref .",
    "po72 ) , which is assigned @xmath11 but has an almost invisible @xmath49 group . new neutron capture and total cross section measurements on @xmath0sm also could be useful .",
    "new measurements with higher resolution and sensitivity could reduce uncertainties in the @xmath1 widths by identifying some of the missing resonances in the relevant energy range and by providing more @xmath9 widths as well as more precise neutron widths .",
    "finally , ( _ n_,@xmath1 ) , ( _ n_,@xmath9 ) , and neutron total cross sections on other nuclides in this mass region should be very useful in shining more light on this interesting problem .",
