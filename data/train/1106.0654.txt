    "this weak scattering forms a peculiar _ lozenge _ pattern , which is much more clearly seen at higher temperatures ( as in fig .",

    "as these rods extend along the @xmath38 direction , the magnetic moments are only weakly correlated along the @xmath40 axis .",
    "the short - range magnetic correlations are either two - dimensional ( confined mostly to the @xmath41 plane ) or one - dimensional ( along the @xmath42 axis ) in nature depending on whether the diffuse scattering is limited mostly to the @xmath37 plane or extends significantly out of this plane .",
    "we will return to the discussion of this issue after presenting the results of monte carlo simulations in the next section .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2_maps]c , there is an intensity minimum around @xmath43 , however , there is no pronounced decay of intensity with increasing @xmath38 or @xmath39 significantly more severe than that due to the magnetic form factor .",
    "the lack of marked modulation in intensity of the rods with @xmath39 and @xmath38 is indicative of magnetic moments directed predominantly along the @xmath44 axis .",
    "the positions of the intensity maxima along the @xmath39 axis are clearly incommensurate , however , their proximity to the half - integer points suggests that the unit cell for this magnetic structure is nearly doubled along the @xmath42 axis .",
    "the shape of the rods also changes on cooling .",

    "[ fig2_maps ] as bounded boxes .    indirect evidence for the existence of low - dimensional diffuse scattering at positions of wave vector @xmath28 which can not be accounted for in a @xmath1 model is also found on re - examination of the powder diffraction results.@xcite in this data additional diffuse intensity",

    "[ fig2_maps]c at the @xmath1 positions of the two rods .",
    "the temperature dependence of the intensity of the ( 030 ) peak , associated with the @xmath1 structure , clearly demonstrates the appearance of magnetic ordering below @xmath23  k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4_temperature]a .",
    "[ fig4_temperature]b and [ fig4_temperature]c on the other hand show that for the diffuse scattering observed in the @xmath37 plane no well - defined phase transition temperature is apparent .",
    "for example , the integrated intensity of diffuse scattering measured in the @xmath37 plane for the @xmath52 region at @xmath53 gradually decreases with increasing temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4_temperature]b ) , while the positions and shapes of the rods in reciprocal space , as characterised by the parameter @xmath47 , are also smooth functions of temperature ( see fig .  [ fig4_temperature]c ) .",
    "in order to gain further insight into the intriguing physics of @xmath0 , we have simulated the partially ordered magnetic arrangements and associated neutron scattering patterns of this compound via the monte carlo ( mc ) method@xcite using a standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "in addition to the isotropic exchange interactions , a single ion anisotropy term@xcite was introduced into the simulation with the _ b _ axis being a hard direction of magnetisation as suggested by the magnetisation measurements.@xcite the simulations were performed with either @xmath54 or @xmath55 supercells containing 12000 or 96000 heisenberg spins with open boundary conditions.@xcite simulated annealing was performed from a temperature @xmath56 ( to ensure the initial acceptance rate always stayed above 90% ) down to @xmath57 with an exponential cooling rate of 0.96 and 8000 spin flips per temperature .    powder diffraction results@xcite showed that only one of the two er@xmath12 sites undergoes long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "one can therefore conjecture that the observed low - temperature diffuse scattering is mostly due to the other site . in the following simulations we presumed that the er@xmath10  sites order while the er@xmath11  sites do not .",
    "an alternative arrangement where the er@xmath11  sites order while the er@xmath10  sites do not was also examined and gave matching results . in the minimalistic model used to simulate the diffuse scattering , the magnetically ordered er@xmath10  sites have been disregarded and only the er@xmath11  ions and interactions between them are considered .",
    "the er@xmath11  sites form triangular ladders running along the @xmath42 axis that are parameterised with two interactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 along the legs and the rungs respectively as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] .",
    "such parameterization produces a network of uncorrelated ladders where the spins are rotating in the _ a - c _ plane in each ladder , and the associated scattering function displays noticeable modulation around the @xmath58 and @xmath59 positions in the @xmath37 scattering plane in broad agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the correct modulation was obtained for a ratio @xmath60 with both interactions made antiferromagnetic  in order to match the specific shape of the diffuse scattering rods in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "this choice of the interaction signs makes sure that the scattering is more intense slightly above ( below ) the @xmath58 position for @xmath49 ( @xmath61 ) , but the situation is reversed around @xmath59 .    to progress further in our analysis , it is useful to note the equivalence of the well - studied linear chain model with nearest and next - nearest interactions@xcite and the er@xmath11  ladders described here if these were `` stretched '' along the @xmath42 axis .",
    "the observed deviation of the most intense diffuse scattering in the @xmath37 plane from the @xmath62 position translates into a deviation of approximately 6 degrees from a perfect antiferromagnetic  arrangement of the nearest spins in the ladder .    whilst this simple two - interaction model seems to capture most of the physics , some detail , such as the absence of scattering around the @xmath43 positions both for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 rods of scattering in the @xmath37 plane and the very peculiar pattern of intensity in the @xmath32 plane ,",
    "are not properly accounted for . in particular , the _ lozenge _ pattern of weak diffuse scattering , emphasised in the highlighted area in fig .",
    "[ fig2_maps]a , is completely blurred in the simple @xmath15-@xmath14 model with the intensity not confined mostly to its corners .",
    "this calls for the addition of another effective interaction between the ladders .    keeping @xmath60 constant",
    ", several such interactions were tried .",
    "the best agreement between the simulated and experimentally observed patterns of diffuse @xmath63 has been obtained by an addition of the interaction denoted as @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] . within the limitations of the minimalistic model used in the simulations , this interaction couples the magnetic ions belonging to different ladders and should be treated as an _ effective _ weak inter - ladder coupling rather than a specific exchange between ions in certain positions .",
    "the value of @xmath64 can not be determined accurately , as its inclusion influences primarily the overall shape of the diffuse scattering rather than a particular feature whose position or intensity could be linked directly to the @xmath65 ratio . much more accurate experimental results as well as the simulations performed on much larger systems ( to improve @xmath28-resolution ) will be required in order to establish @xmath64 reliably .",
    "the cuts through the simulated @xmath63 corresponding to the two measured scattering planes , @xmath32 and @xmath37 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5_mc ] for a model in which @xmath66 .",
    "we return here to the intriguing issue of the dimensionality of the short - range correlations in @xmath0 . from an experimental point of view , in order to check whether the short - range correlations seen as undulated rods of intensity in figs .",
    "[ fig2_maps]c and [ fig2_maps]d are quasi-1d or 2d in nature , one has to make extended scans along the @xmath44 direction across the reciprocal space points such as @xmath67 , @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "these types of scans are impossible on the neutron diffractometers used in this investigation without a complete realignment of the sample . given the neutron beam - time constraints the realignment was not performed , therefore the experimental information obtained so far is insufficient to draw a definite conclusion regarding the dimensionality of the correlations .    when carrying out the monte carlo simulations , it is straightforward to check whether the intensity observed as rods in the @xmath37 scattering plane in fig .",
    "[ fig5_mc ] protrudes significantly out of this plane . indeed",
    ", the results of our simulations suggest that this is the case and that the intensity forms undulated planes such as @xmath70 and @xmath71 rather than rods . one has to bare in mind , however , that the simple model adopted in the simulations excludes the interactions between the two rare - earth sites .",
    "the results of the simulations call for further experimental studies , which should aim to probe the correlations along the @xmath72 $ ] direction in order to make a conclusive statement on this aspect of the magnetic ordering in @xmath0",
    ". the onset of the fully ordered @xmath1 structure at @xmath25 does not appear to affect the diffraction pattern of the diffuse phase . in order to explain this lack of coupling between the two types of ordering , and the observation that a significant moment contributing to the @xmath1 structure lies only on one of the two er@xmath12 sites , we suggest that each of the sites contributes to only one of the two coexisting structures .",
    "the different lengths of the inter - site exchange pathways ( shown in light grey and dark grey in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] ) compared to those between symmetry equivalent positions of the same site may provide an explanation for the weak correlation between the two magnetic structures .",
    "the low - dimensional character of the magnetic correlations could be a generic feature of several sr@xmath5o@xmath6  compounds .",
    "for example , in @xmath73  karunadasa _ et al._@xcite have reported the observation of broad magnetic peaks in powder neutron diffraction patterns at low temperature .",
    "these peaks exhibit a characteristic warren lineshape indicative of the presence of 2d ordering.@xcite it is not _ a priori _ clear , however , if on further cooling @xmath73  will undergo a transition into a fully ordered 3d magnetic structure or ( similarly to @xmath0 ) it will maintain separate 3d and low - dimensional magnetic components . in another member of the same family of compounds , @xmath74 ,",
    "no sharp magnetic bragg peaks have been found down to 50  mk in the recent powder neutron diffraction experiments,@xcite while the shapes of the observed broad diffuse - scattering peaks are not symmetric , which again implies 2d correlations .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the magnetic neutron diffraction patterns in single crystal @xmath0  between 0.06 and 1.0  k , and have confirmed the presence of a 3d commensurate antiferromagnetic  state below 0.75  k. we have also observed a short - range ordered magnetic phase that coexists with the commensurate phase , in which the size of the magnetic unit cell is nearly doubled along the @xmath42 axis and which does not exhibit critical behaviour .",
    "the presence of two non - interacting magnetic phases in @xmath0  is an example of the unusual physics arising from geometrically frustrated magnetism .",
    "a classical monte carlo simulation shows that a simple model based on a ladder of triangles where the nearest neighbour interactions are approximately 5 times stronger than the next - nearest neighbour interactions mimics satisfactorily the observed diffuse scattering patterns .",
    "even better agreement between the experimental results and simulations is achieved if the ladders are very weakly coupled through an effective further - neighbour interaction .",
