    "the vectorial feature or the polarization property of an electromagnetic beam , which concerns its angular momentum @xcite , intensity distribution @xcite , and diffraction characteristics @xcite , has become important in diverse areas of applications , including optical tweezers and spanner @xcite , optical data storage , optical trapping and manipulation @xcite , and dark - field imaging @xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "more and more attention @xcite has been paid to the imbert - fedorov effect @xcite , which means a transverse displacement of a reflected @xcite or a transmitted @xcite beam taking place at a dielectric interface .",
    "recently , there was a controversy @xcite over the physical properties of the incident beams that were used to discuss the characteristics of the imbert - fedorov effect .",
    "bliokh and bliokh @xcite made a detailed comparison of the incident beam in ref .",
    "@xcite with that in ref .",
    "they found that the physical properties of the incident beam in ref .",
    "@xcite depend on the `` incidence angle '' and concluded that that kind of beam `` is meaningless from the physical viewpoint '' .",
    "such a controversy concerns in fact the representation formalism of a finite beam .",
    "the representation formalism and propagation characteristics of an electromagnetic beam in free space has drawn much attention @xcite after the advent of masers and lasers @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a linearly polarized solution of a beam is not compatible with the maxwell equations , because it does not satisfy the transversality condition .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that the polarization state is in general not a global property of a beam .",
    "rather it is local and changes on propagation .",
    "it was argued by approaches of either vector potentials @xcite or whittaker potentials @xcite that the representation of beams with a couple of fixed unit vectors , one in the transverse direction and the other in the longitudinal direction , would yield @xcite a complete set of beam modes in terms of which an arbitrary electromagnetic beam might be expressed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop the representation formalism of a free - space electromagnetic beam from the transversality condition . in section [ interaction ]",
    "we first introduce a mapping matrix ( mm ) that maps a 2-component jones vector @xcite to a 3-component electric - field vector associated with a plane wave .",
    "then we show that the transversality condition allows us to have one degree of freedom to choose the mm .",
    "the degree of freedom can be represented by the azimuthal angle @xmath0 of a fixed unit vector @xmath1 with respect to the wave vector . after proving a theorem on the property of the mm , we attempt to interpret the degree of freedom as the interaction angle between the photon s momentum and spin . in section [ representation formalism ]",
    "we put forward the general representation formalism for the field vector of a finite beam , letting the fixed unit vector @xmath1 lie in the plane @xmath2 and make an angle @xmath3 with the @xmath4-axis , the beam s propagation direction .",
    "when the normalized jones vector of the angular spectrum is independent of the wave vector , we obtain a mm for the field vector of a beam .",
    "the impact of the interaction angle @xmath3 on the properties of a beam is investigated in section [ impact ] . after calculating the field vector in the first - order approximation under the paraxial condition and establishing the relation with the incident beams in refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we find a transverse effect that a beam of elliptically polarized angular spectrum is displaced from the center in the direction that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the unit vector @xmath1 and the propagation direction .",
    "the origin of this effect is also discussed . at last",
    "we show with a beam of linearly polarized angular spectrum that the local polarization state of the transverse component depends on the angle @xmath3 and changes on propagation .",

    "( [ factorization ] ) satisfies the transversality condition whatever the jones vector @xmath43 may be .",
    "but there are only five equations for the six unknown elements of the mm .",
    "this shows that when the transversality condition is taken into account , we still have one degree of freedom to choose the mm . that is to say , the transversality condition itself is not sufficient to determine an electromagnetic wave from a given jones vector .",
    "it is well known @xcite that if the unit vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined from the wave vector @xmath25 in terms of an arbitrary fixed real unit vector @xmath1 as @xmath44 then they satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ perpendicular to k ] ) and ( [ perpendicular to each other ] ) .",
    "one might conclude that the degree of freedom is the unit vector @xmath1 .",
    "this is obviously not true , because we need two independent variables to determine the orientation of a unit vector in a 3d space .",
    "but we can really use the real unit vector @xmath1 to denote the degree of freedom somehow . to show this ,",
    "let us look at a particular wave vector @xmath25 and the unit vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 that are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ triad ] ) in terms of a fixed unit vector @xmath1 as is schematically depicted in fig . [ orientation ] .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the rotation of @xmath1 around @xmath25 by changing the azimuthal angle @xmath0 of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath25 alters the orientation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    ", the rotation of @xmath1 around @xmath35 by changing the polar angle @xmath45 of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath25 does not alter the orientation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so it is the azimuthal angle @xmath0 that plays the role of the degree of freedom and uniquely determines the mm .",

    "consider an arbitrary jones vector @xmath43 that is mapped to a 3-component field vector @xmath24 by @xmath47 as is described by eqs .",

    "( [ perpendicular to each other ] ) , @xmath47 has the following property , @xmath48 where superscript @xmath49 stands for the transpose .",
    "suppose that this field vector can also be mapped to from the same jones vector by another mm , say , @xmath50 .",
    "that is to say , suppose that this field vector can also be given by @xmath51 where the two column vectors of @xmath52 are defined by @xmath53 it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ unity ] ) , ( [ factorization ] ) , and ( [ factorization ] ) that @xmath54 because the definition of the mm is independent of the jones vector , eq .",
    "( [ contradiction ] ) requires @xmath55 which is obviously impossible unless @xmath56 .",
    "this proves the theorem .",
    "now that one jones vector can be mapped to an infinite number of field vectors due to the mm s degree of freedom , the whole 2d space of the 3-component field vector associated with a particular wave vector is divided into an infinite number of subspaces .",
    "each subspace is mapped to from the jones - vector space by a specific mm and is therefore isomorphic to the jones - vector space .",

    "let us look at the cross product @xmath58 in the definition of @xmath35 .",
    "it is easily proven that @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 @xmath62 s are hermitian matrices satisfying the canonical commutation relations of the angular momentum , @xmath63= \\hat{s}_i \\hat{s}_j- \\hat{s}_j \\hat{s}_i= i \\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{s}_k,\\ ] ] and can be regarded as representing the three cartesian components of the photon s spin operator @xmath64 @xcite acting on the 3-component field vector , where @xmath65 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "since the wave vector represents the photon s momentum @xmath66 , we may think that eq .",
    "( [ m - s interaction ] ) expresses the interaction of the photon s momentum with the spin , in which the unit vector @xmath1 plays a vital role . due to the following property , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an arbitrary constant ,",
    "it is only the azimuthal angle @xmath0 of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath25 that plays the role in the interaction .",
    "so we may conclude that the interaction of the photon s momentum with the spin is mediated by the degree of freedom of the mm . in the following",
    ", we will refer to @xmath0 as the interaction angle of the momentum with the spin .",
    "we have identified one degree of freedom of the mm and interpreted it as the interaction angle of the momentum of the photon with the spin . for a single plane wave ,",
    "the impact of the interaction angle is not evident .",
    "so in the following we will investigate the impact of the interaction angle on the properties of finite beams .",
    "a finite beam consists of an infinite number of plane waves .",
    "each of the plane wave is different from one another in the direction of the wave vector .",
    "it seems impossible to realize physically the same interaction angle for all of the wave vectors .",
    "we assume that the fixed unit vector @xmath1 for a finite beam lies in the plane @xmath2 and makes an angle @xmath3 with the @xmath4-axis , the propagation direction , @xmath69 so that the mm takes the form of @xmath70 where latexmath:[\\[\\label{normalization factor }    in this case , the angle @xmath3 plays the role of the interaction angle between the momentum and the spin .",
    "it should be noted that different values of @xmath3 correspond to the same interaction angle for each of those wave vectors that also lie in the @xmath2 plane as we have shown before in fig .",
    "[ orientation ] .",
    "such a feature of @xmath3 will produce a very interesting transverse effect as will be shown in section [ impact ] .",

    "now that the cylindrical vector beam can be obtained experimentally @xcite from the uniformly - polarized beam by changing the interaction angle from @xmath192 into @xmath98 , it is expectable that the beam that shows the transverse effect can also be obtained in experiments from either the uniformly - polarized beam or the cylindrical vector beam by changing the interaction angle @xmath3 into a value that is neither equal to @xmath194 nor to @xmath195 .",
