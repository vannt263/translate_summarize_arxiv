    "at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite protons will soon collide at an astonishing 800 million times per second to provide experimental evidence for the higgs @xcite , supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite or extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "susy is widely considered to be one of the best candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it provides an explanation for the higgs mass problem , a candidate for cold dark matter , and unification of low energy gauge couplings by introducing superpartners to sm fields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative to susy is given by phenomenological extra - dimensional models such as large extra dimensions ( leds ) @xcite , warped braneworlds @xcite or universal extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "scenarios with leds are specially appealing . in these models , gravity becomes strong at the tev scale , where radiative stability is achieved .",
    "the fundamental scale of gravity , @xmath0 tev , is related to the observed planck scale , @xmath1 , by the relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the volume of the extra @xmath4-dimensional space .",

    "the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc are entrusted with the task of studying events with large transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) , a signature common to both susy and extra dimensions . while we wait for these experiments to start collecting data , it is worthwhile to look into means of distinguishing susy and extra - dimensional models @xcite",
    ". comparisons of susy and universal extra dimensions / little higgs models in colliders have been investigated by various authors @xcite .",
    "discrimination of susy and bh events by means of dilepton events was recently discussed by the authors in ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we revisit that analysis and extend it to include event shape variables , missing transverse momentum  and visible energy .",
    "bh and susy events are simulated with the bh generator ` catfish ` @xcite and the high - energy event generator ` pythia ` @xcite , respectively .",
    "susy masses are set with ` isajet ` @xcite .",
    "the analysis below will show that susy and bh events can be clearly distinguished at the lhc .",
    "bh events tend to be more spherical than susy events because of the isotropic nature of bh decay .",
    "thus event shape variables , such as sphericity , provide good discriminators . on the contrary , visible energy and  are less effective discriminators because of the presence of invisible channels in both susy and bh models , which make the amount of  comparable in the two scenarios .",
    "the dilepton invariant mass is also an excellent discriminator ; the susy invariant mass shows a sharp cutoff at @xmath6 100 gev , which is absent in the bh model because most of the dileptons originate from uncorrelated events .",

    "an upper limit on the bh mass is obtained by assuming no gravitational energy loss at formation , corresponding to the black disk ( bd ) cross - section @xmath38 .",
    "a more realistic model assumes that all the cm energy is not available for bh formation , some being lost as gravitational radiation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . to estimate the energy loss ,",
    "the colliding particles are treated as two aichelburg - sexl shock waves @xcite ; the overlap of the shock waves forms a trapped - surface ( ts ) which sets a lower limit to the mass of the bh @xcite .",

    "sm particles are emitted on the brane and can be detected @xcite .",
    "since the balding phase is poorly understood , simulations neglect the energy loss in this phase .",
    "the description of the evaporation phase is also approximated ; since emissivities of rotating bhs are not known for all fields , bh generators use greybody factors for non - rotating bhs @xcite . in catfish ,",

    "a more detailed discussion of the evaporation and planck phases of tev bhs can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "dilepton production in bh events differ greatly from dilepton production in the mssm .",
    "unlike susy , there is no single process of dilepton production ; dileptons are either produced by the bh directly or by the decay of heavier particles such as the @xmath56 boson , @xmath57 pairs of a combination of the two .",
    "therefore , the bh dilepton invariant mass does not show a sharp cut - off at high energy .",
    "susy simulations are carried out using a combination of ` isajet ` and ` pythia ` , with the former generating the mass spectrum .",
    "bh simulations are carried out using the ` catfish ` monte carlo generator .",
    "the setup for each simulation is summarized below :    * susy : * * the mssm mass spectrum is generated with ` isajet ` ( ver .",
    "7.75 ) ; * * the mass spectra in slha format is fed into ` pythia ` ; * * all susy processes except sm higgs production are simulated ; * * unstable sm particles and sparticles are hadronized or decayed with ` pythia ` . *",
    "bhs : * * the cross section for a bh event is calculated in the center - of - mass frame ; * * the initial bh mass is sampled from the differential cross section ; * * the bh is decayed through hawking mechanism and final @xmath4-body event ( or remnant ) ; * * unstable quanta are hadronized or decayed with ` pythia ` .",
    "the benchmark model for susy is lhc point a. the parameters for the bh benchmark model are fundamental planck scale @xmath58 tev , minimum bh mass @xmath59 tev , classical - to - quantum threshold @xmath60 tev , six extra - dimensions ( @xmath61 ) and two - body final decay ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "particles produced in the initial - radiation phase are removed by imposing @xmath5 cuts of @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 gev for leptons and photons+hadrons , respectively @xcite .",
    "in this section , we first use event shape variables to discriminate susy and bhs models .",
    "we then complement these results by looking at isolated dilepton events .",
    "the salient features of this analysis is that bh events tend to be more spherical than susy events due to the spherical nature of the hawking radiation .",
    "this is specially evident for high - mass bhs .",
    "the formation of a stable bh remnant at the end of the evaporation phase also helps to discriminate mssm and bh events because of the large amount of energy which is carried away by the remnant .",
    "isolated dilepton events provide a further powerful means to distinguish the two models .",
    "this is due to the fact that leptons are rarely emitted by bhs ( the hadron - to - lepton ratio is approximately 5:1 ) and are uncorrelated ; they can be emitted at any angle w.r.t .",
    "beam axis , whereas susy dileptons typically originate from a single decay chain .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows visible energy , missing transverse momentum , and transverse momentum of leptons and hadrons+photons for 10,000 mssm and bh benchmark events . even in the absence of a bh remnant ,",
    "the amount of visible energy and  is comparable for the two scenarios .",
    "this is due to the presence of invisible channels in both models : the lsp for susy and neutrinos+gravitons for the bh .",
    "the flavor of the decay products is a better discriminator .",
    "mssm interactions do not produce leptons with energy above the tev since isolated leptons are produced by the decay of sparticles with typical energy of less than a few hundred gev .",
    "on the contrary , quanta produced in the bh decay are characterized by an average energy @xmath65 , where the multiplicity @xmath66 is less than 10 for typical bhs at the lhc . since hawking evaporation",
    "does not distinguish leptons from hadrons , hard leptons with energy up to several tev are likely to be produced during the bh decay .",
    "this suggests that isolated leptons may provide a powerful means to discriminate the two models .",
    "this is indeed the case , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "the four plots in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show how variations in the bh planck phase affect the observables of fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the plots compare two- and four - body decays to the formation of a bh remnant ( @xmath67 ) . by the time the remnant has formed , the bh is expected to have shed electric and color charges .",
    "( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative scenario . )",
    "if this is the case , the bh remnant is undetectable and a source of missing transverse momentum in addition to neutrinos and gravitons which are emitted during the hawking evaporation phase .",
    "this leads to a larger difference in  between the mssm and bh models .",
    "the visible transverse momentum in hadrons+photons is sensibly reduced in the presence of a bh remnant ; the latter carries away energy which otherwise would have been emitted in visible channels ( mostly hadrons ) during the bh decay phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the amount of transverse momentum in the leptonic channel is essentially unaffected by the presence of a bh remnant .",
    "this is due to the fact that leptons are rarer than hadrons in the bh decay phase ; variations in the energy distribution of the leptonic channel are thus suppressed compared to the hadronic channel .",
    "changes in the number of final planckian hard quanta do not produce significant differences in the distributions ; more quanta of lower energy behave statistically like less quanta with higher energy . provided that the bh decays at the end of the hawking phase , it is thus safe to set the number of planckian quanta to @xmath62 or @xmath68 , although bhs may decay in different numbers of particles on a event - to - event basis .",
    "variations in the classical - to - quantum threshold @xmath69 are also not expected to cause significant differences in the energy / momentum distributions . a higher threshold increases the emission in the planck phase while decreasing hawking radiation .",
    "since these phases differs only in relative greybody factors , the effect is too small to be detected .",
    "the four plots in the right panel of fig .  [ fig3 ] show visible energy , , and visible transverse momenta of leptons and hadrons+photons for different values of the fundamental planck scale .",
    "higher values of @xmath70 lead to more massive bhs , i.e.  higher multiplicity and more energetic quanta .",
    "this causes a significant increase in missing and visible momenta .",
    "if the value of the fundamental planck scale happens to be large , bhs are likely to be found and easily distinguished from susy through detection of highly - energetic isolated leptons and hadronic jets . missing transverse momentum of several tev",
    "would also be observed .",
    "event shape variables such as sphericity and @xmath71 fox - wolfram moment can be used to complement the above analysis .",
    "bh events are more spherical because of the nature of hawking radiation and the `` jetty '' nature of susy decays .",
    "formation of a bh remnant and high values of the fundamental scale lead to significant higher sphericity than susy ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . the @xmath71 fox - wolfram moment ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is stable versus changes in the bh planck phase and provides a good mssm / bh discriminator .",
    "bh models with higher @xmath70 can be differentiated more easily from the mssm .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached by looking at jet masses and number of jets .",
    "the mssm generates more and lighter jets than the bh model due to copious production of quarks ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the difference is again specially significant for high values of @xmath70 and in the presence of bh remnants .",
    "absence of sub-@xmath69 hard jets could provide strong evidence for bh remnant production .",
    "( see the suppression of heavy jets below the classical - to - quantum threshold @xmath72 tev in the top leftmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . )              the use of isolated dileptons as susy signature has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "although their production is not as high as colored particles , high - energy isolated leptons provide a cleaner environment by allowing the removal of the qcd background . moreover ,",
    "since most of bhs produced at the lhc are expected to be very light , multi - particle analysis may not provide the most effective discriminators @xcite .",
    "the study of leptonic final states alleviates this problem .    the dominant mssm interaction for opposite - sign , same - flavor ( ossf ) dileptons at lhc point a is @xcite @xmath73 with a branching ratio of 27% .",
    "the maximum dilepton invariant mass for this interaction is @xmath74^{1/2 } \\sim 100~{\\rm gev}\\ , . \\label{mll}\\ ] ] the background for this process is due to sm decays of @xmath75 , @xmath76 bosons and top quarks . this background can be removed by applying suitable cuts on transverse momentum and sphericity of the leptons @xcite :    * @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 ; * isolation cut , @xmath79 gev in a cone of @xmath80 ,    where @xmath81 is the transverse momentum of the leptons , @xmath82 , @xmath83 $ ] is the pseudorapidity , and @xmath84 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal and polar angles of the lepton w.r.t .  beam axis , respectively .",
    "isolated leptons in bh decays come directly from the bh itself , from the decay of @xmath56 bosons and top quarks , or from a combination of the two . since the branching ratio of @xmath56 into leptons is small , @xmath85 @xcite , and the decay of top quarks into leptons is rare @xcite , production of ossf dileptons is less frequent in the bh model than in the mssm .",
    "our analysis shows that an ossf dilepton event occurs approximately every 100 bh and 20 susy events , with a @xmath6 1:5 ratio of bh - to - susy dilepton events at fixed luminosity .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the dilepton invariant mass distribution for the mssm ( shaded pink plot ) and the bh model with final two- and four - body decay ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "as expected , the susy distribution shows a sharp edge at @xmath6 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the bh invariant mass distribution is characterized by a peak at @xmath86 gev and a long tail up to energy of several tev .",
    "the peak is due to dileptons events produced from the decay of @xmath56 bosons , the dominant channel for ossf dilepton production in bh .",
    "the tail is originated by uncorrelated lepton pairs emitted directly by the bh or in top quark decays .",
    "the leptons are hard and the reconstructed dilepton mass can have super - tev values .",
    "the bh invariant mass for the two - body planckian decay shows a second , smaller peak at @xmath6 1 tev .",
    "this occurs because the bh at the end of the hawking phase may decay in two ossf leptons , leading to a reconstructed dilepton invariant mass equal to @xmath87 .",
    "if the planckian decay is a four - body process , the bh mass at the end of the hawking evaporation is distributed among four quanta .",
    "this produces a lower , smoother reconstructed invariant mass .",
    "the number of isolated , high-@xmath5 leptons can also be used to complement the dilepton analysis ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "susy events are capable of producing up to five isolated leptons from the cascade decay of heavy sparticles .",
    "events with @xmath88 or @xmath89 may produce four or three isolated leptons , respectively @xcite . on the contrary , events with three or more isolated leptons are very suppressed in bh decays at the lhc energy .",
    "although multilepton events are rare , there is very little background and they could be effectively used to distinguish the mssm and the bh model .",
    "other effective discriminators can be constructed by looking at dilepton events with same sign and/or opposite - flavor leptons .",
    "the `` democratic '' nature of the bh decay makes all dilepton events roughly equally probable , whereas the mssm favors same - flavor dileptons .",
    "presence of hard opposite - flavor leptons is a clear indication of bh decay ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that 73% of susy dilepton events are ossf , compared to only 50% in the bh model .",
    "conversely , opposite - flavor events are twice more frequent in the bh model ( 40% ) compared to the mssm ( 21% ) .",
    "we have discussed and compared the signatures of the mssm and the tev - bh model at the lhc . a thorough analysis of event - shape variables and dilepton events has shown that it is possible to distinguish the two models .",
    "bh events are characterized by higher sphericity than susy processes . if a bh remnant is formed at the end of the evaporation phase , missing @xmath5 and heavy jet mass are effective signatures to discriminate bh formation from the mssm .",
    "although event - shape variables alone can not unequivocally discriminate between susy and bhs , their knowledge may prove useful when combined with the analysis of the leptonic channel .",
    "isolated dileptons could provide the `` smoking gun '' for detecting bhs at the lhc .",
    "the bh dilepton invariant mass shows a tail at high energy which is absent in the sm or mssm .",
    "this analysis can be further strengthened by looking at the number and flavor of isolated leptons .",
