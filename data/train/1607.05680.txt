    "the possibility of topological phase transition in the related tellurohalides , bitebr and bitecl , has not been studied yet .    to draw a conclusion about the existence of pressure - induced topological phases in these compounds , one should first find out whether any pressure - induced crystal phase transitions ( cpt ) would occur under pressure . in the case of bitei ,",

    "the surface states touch the crossing ( weyl ) points of the conduction and valence bulk bands . in the topological phase ( figs .",

    "the crossing of two surface states occurs in the band gap slightly above the bulk conduction band minima while on the te - terminated surface the crossing ( dirac ) point is inside off the valence bands due to the mixing of surface and bulk electronic bands .",
    "the surface electronic structure obtained with taking into account the effect of band bending as well as its evolution under pressure is different .",
    "the overall band structure is strongly modified because a set of well - defined bychkov - rashba type spin split surface bands appearing due to the band - bending effect.@xcite in the topologically trivial phase ( figs .",

    "the occupied surface electronic states appear mainly inside or at the edge of the bulk bands except the topmost state which is shifted upwards into the energy gap .",

    "the surface electronic structure of weyl semimetals is characterized by the presence of fermi arcs connecting the weyl points with opposite chirality .",
    "figure  [ fig : fermi_arcs ] shows the electronic spectra at the fermi level of the ( 001 ) surface for both terminations .",
    "the isoenergetic surface spectra were calculated with and without the account of the band - bending at a pressure of 3.84  gpa which corresponds to a weyl semimetal phase ( see fig .  [",

    "the fermi arcs link up the pair of weyl points induced originally along the a - h ( @xmath37@xmath38 ) direction of the bulk ( surface ) bz . the form of fermi arcs depends on the surface termination . on the te - terminated surface , they form arc - like curves coinciding with the trajectory of a pair of nodes which move clockwise and counterclockwise over the bz . in the case of i - termination ,",
    "the fermi arcs connect the pairs of weyl points by a straight line . on further increase in pressure , the length of fermi arcs increases and when the weyl semimetal ",
    "ti phase transition occurs the arcs connect with each other forming a gapless topological surface state .    with the account of band bending , in addition to",

    "[ fig : surf](h ) and ( k ) ) . in the case of i - termination",

    "after the transition the isoenergetic electronic structure is presented by a single closed curve of the topological surface state .    the formation of fermi arcs is closely related to the spin texture of the surface states . without account of band bending , the single closed contour in the topological phase has a clockwise spin helicity.@xcite in the weyl semimetal phase , fermi arcs inherit this behaviour   the helicity also has a clockwise character .",
    "the spin texture `` connects '' the source and drain weyl points in the clockwise order , so the fermi arcs link up the pair of points emerged along the a - h direction .",

    ", the cpt takes place after the topological phase transition and at pressures which are beyond the pressure range ( 3.733.93  gpa ) where the weyl semimetal phase exists .",
    "thus the cpt is accompanied by a tpt from a topological insulator to a normal semiconducting phase .    to additionally verify the proposed structure we have also calculated raman mode frequencies for the p3m1 phase up to 8  gpa and for the pnma structure at pressures 10 , 12 , and 14  gpa ( fig .",

    "all the modes are non degenerate . some of them coincide with the experimental data . in general , variation of raman mode frequencies with pressure ( 101214  gpa ) resembles the behaviour of the experimental raman modes .",
    "however , the number of the calculated raman modes in the pnma structure ( 13 are shown in the figure while the total number of raman modes is equal to 18 ) is almost twice as large as the experimental data .",
    "although the experimental raman spectrum at high pressures bears some similarity to the calculated pnma spectrum the measured modes apparently correspond to a more symmetric structure .",
