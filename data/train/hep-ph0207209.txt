    "the use of a muon storage ring as an intense source of neutrinos has attracted renewed attention : it is a natural stepping stone toward a muon collider , and it would offer a wealth of opportunities for doing physics both of neutrinos ( long baseline ) , and with neutrinos ( front - end ) . whereas the physics of neutrino oscillations , and in particular the possibility of discovering cp violation in the neutrino sector provide some of the strongest motivations for a neutrino factory , a sizable part of the physics program at such a facility should be devoted to the use of the neutrino beam as a probe of matter .",
    "end physics at a neutrino factory is based on the realization that , because of the flavor and spin structure of the coupling of neutrinos to weak currents , a neutrino beam has a greater physics potential than conventional electron or muon beams , and it can be used to perform tests of unsurpassed precision of the standard model , and as a probe of hadron structure of unique sensitivity .    here",
    "we will briefly review the potential of neutrino beams as probes of matter .",
    "first , we will review deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) with neutrino beams , and show that it can be used to sort out the flavor structure of parton distributions of the nucleon , both polarized and unpolarized .",
    "then , we will consider increasingly less inclusive measurements , and see how they can be used to shed light on various other aspects of hadron structure , such as fragmentation functions and generalized parton distributions .",
    "the results discussed here are based on a recent detailed quantitative study performed by a cern working group  @xcite ; quantitative estimates given here are taken from there unless otherwise stated , and are based on the ` cern scenario '  @xcite for a neutrino factory : specifically , a 50  gev @xmath0 beam , with @xmath1 muon decays per year along a 100  m straight section . for other studies on the physics potential of neutrino factories",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ; a recent status report on the neutrino factory / muon collider project is in ref .",
    "inclusive dis is the standard way of accessing the parton content of hadrons .",
    "the use of neutrino beams allows one to study dis mediated by the weak , rather than electromagnetic interaction . the neutrino - nucleon deep - inelastic cross section for charged  current interactions , up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath2",
    "is given by [ disxsec ] & & = \\",

    "the advantage of @xmath9 and @xmath10-mediated dis over conventional @xmath11 dis is clear when inspecting the parton content of the polarized and unpolarized structure functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "if @xmath21 ( incoming @xmath22 beam ) , then @xmath23 . the structure functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parity  violating , and therefore not accessible in virtual photon scattering .",
    "of course , beyond leading order in the strong coupling each quark or antiquark flavor s contribution receives @xmath27 corrections proportional to itself and to all other quark , antiquark and gluon distributions .",
    "the gluon correction is flavor  blind , and thus decouples from the parity  violating structure functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence , thanks to the weak couplings , more independent linear combination of individual quark and antiquark distributions are accessible .",
    "a further advantage of a neutrino factory follows from the fact that the neutrino beam has a broad - band energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ strfun ] ) . because @xmath28 , at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 only varies with the beam energy . hence , at a neutrino factory it is possible to disentangle the individual structure functions which make up the cross section eq .",

    "some information on strangeness can be extracted  @xcite from neutrino data , while some less  inclusive observables ( such as @xmath9 production , or drell  yan ) provide some constraints on the relative size of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 distributions , but the results are at best semi  quantitative ( see fig .

    "independent flavor and antilabor separation is possible to 10%20% accuracy in most of the accessible kinematic range .    such detailed knowledge of the flavor content of the nucleon , besides providing interesting clues on the nucleon structure , is crucial in extracting information on possible new physics signal from experimental data . for example",
    ", recently a @xmath35 discrepancy has been found between the determination of the weinberg angle from the total @xmath34 dis cross section  @xcite and the best fit standard model prediction . however , the most likely explanation of the effect  @xcite is a difference in shape between @xmath36 and @xmath37 distributions , which was disregarded in the analysis of ref .",
    "this @xmath38 difference is compatible with current uncertainties , and favored by the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , but essentially impossible to determine accurately with present - day data .",
    "this kind of situation is bound to become increasingly more common as subtle new physics effects will have to be disentangled from the huge standard background at future hadron colliders .",
    "it is unlikely that any other hadron physics facility ( such as , for instance , the planned electron - ion collider  @xcite ) could be competitive with a neutrino factory for flavor and quark - antiquark separation , and reach the level of accuracy of fig .",
    "[ pdfec ] .",
    "polarized dis has recently attracted considerable attention  @xcite because of the unexpected smallness of the proton s singlet axial charge @xmath39 . in the naive parton model",
    "the singlet axial charge is the fraction of the nucleon spin which is carried by quarks .",
    "the zweig rule predicts that it should be approximately equal to the octet axial charge @xmath40 , which differs from it because of the strange contribution , expected to be small in a nucleon .",
    "the octet charge can be determined using su(3 ) from baryon @xmath41decay constants : @xmath42 , so the zweig rule leads to expect that the quark spin fraction is around 60% .",
    "however , the experimental value is compatible with zero .",
    "clearly , this result points to a peculiar role of strangeness in the nucleon , but the issue is made more subtle by the inclusion of qcd corrections .",
    "indeed , beyond leading order the axial charge is given by  @xcite [ anomeq ] a_0= - g , where @xmath43 is the scale  invariant quark spin fraction , and @xmath44 is the gluon spin fraction .",
    "the latter , due to the axial anomaly , gives an effectively leading  order contribution to @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ anomeq ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "gluons decouple from the octet charge @xmath40 .",
    "so , a first possibility is that gluons are responsible for the difference : @xmath44 is large enough that the quark spin @xmath45 even though @xmath46 .",
    "( ` anomaly ' scenario ) .",
    "a different option ( ` instanton ' scenario  @xcite ) is that @xmath47 because of a large contribution from sea quarks ( @xmath48 ) whose polarization is anticorrelated to that of valence quarks , possibly because of ` instanton ' qcd vacuum configurations .",
    "yet another possibility ( ` skyrmion ' scenario  @xcite ) is that @xmath47 is small because of a large contribution from ` valence ' strange quarks @xmath49 .    at present ,",
    "flavor separation is only possible in the isotriplet sector , and only the total quark and gluon spin fractions can be extracted from nc dis data  @xcite , and then with modest accuracy : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "it is of course impossible to polarize the kind of targets which are required for present  day neutrino dis experiments , so little information on strangeness and no information at all on the quark  antiquark separation is available in the polarized case . at a neutrino factory ,",
    "significant rates could be achieved with small targets  @xcite : with a detector radius of 50  cm , 100  m length , the structure functions @xmath52 , @xmath26 could be independently measured to an accuracy which is about one order of magnitude better than that with which @xmath52 is determined in present charged lepton dis experiments . on the basis of such data ,",
    "the distinct scenarios could be well separated from each other  @xcite : for instance in an ` instanton ' scenario @xmath53(1,1\\,{\\rm gev}^2)=-0.007\\pm0.007 $ ] ; while in a ` skyrmion' scenario one would observe @xmath53(1,1\\,{\\rm gev}^2)=-0.106\\pm0.008 $ ] .",
    "in fact full flavor separation at the level of first moments would be possible .",
    "again , the same result could be hardly achieved anywhere else , since forthcoming experiments are unlikely to determine @xmath54 and @xmath55 better than current experiment determined the unpolarized @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "-.5 cm    -2.cm    semi - inclusive experiments are a large fraction of the physics program of present - day electron scattering experiments such as compass  @xcite and hermes  @xcite . at a neutrino factory ,",
    "semi - inclusive charm production would be copious and easy to detect , because of the pair of opposite - sign muons in the final state which characterize the charm decay .",
    "a precise determination of the unpolarized and polarized tagged charm structure functions would be possible , since [ cstrf ] f^_1,c ( x , q^2 ) = |v_cs|^2 s ( , _ c^2 ) + |v_cd|^2 d ( , _ c^2 ) ; g^_1,c ( x , q^2 ) =    direct determination of the strange distribution ( see fig .  [ f2c ] ) , though in the polarized case one should worry about possible large gluon corrections , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ anomeq ] ) .",
    "also , one could perform accurate studies of deep - inelastic charm production close to threshold , which is theoretically quite interesting in perturbative qcd  @xcite due to the simultaneous presence of two hard scales ( @xmath29 and @xmath56 ) .    -.7",
    "cm    -.6 cm",
    "semi - inclusive production of specific particles offers information on both parton distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "an example is polarized @xmath57 production : the @xmath57 polarization can be determined from the angular distribution of its decay , and one can construct asymmetries which are directly sensitive to polarized fragmentation functions . the latter are currently poorly known , and can only be determined on the basis of theoretical assumptions  @xcite :  that they are su(3 ) flavor symmetric , or on the contrary that the octet combination is much larger than the singlet , in analogy to what happens for the proton spin fraction .",
    "predictions for the asymmetry @xmath58 as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath59 carried by the fragmenting quark are shown in fig .",
    "[ lampol ] for fragmentation functions based on different theoretical assumptions , and for @xmath60 dis ( compass ) or @xmath34 dis . just as for structure functions ,",
    "the flavor dependence of @xmath34 couplings makes results with a @xmath34 beam significantly more sensitive to the flavor structure of the fragmenting hadron .",
    "l0.5    -1.8 cm     -.3 cm    -.7 cm    hard qcd factorization can be generalized to several less inclusive processes by introducing generalized parton distributions  @xcite ( gpd ) @xmath61 .",
    "these quantities interpolate between the usual nucleon form factor @xmath62 ( which is related to the first @xmath6moment of @xmath63 ) and parton distribution @xmath64 ( related to the @xmath65 limit of @xmath63 ) .",
    "an example of such process is exclusive @xmath66 production ( fig .",
    "[ spd ] ) . in the kinematic region where the virtuality @xmath29 of the @xmath9 boson is large compared to the nucleon momentum transfer @xmath67 and all masses , the cross section for the process factorizes as [ gpdfact ] ( w^-+nd^-_s+n)=h_df , where @xmath68 is the cross  section for the underlying hard perturbative parton subprocess , @xmath69 is the @xmath70 fragmentation function , and @xmath63 is the gpd .",
    "the estimated cross section for this process is @xmath71  pb . the chorus collaboration has observed one such event , but in the region @xmath72  gev@xmath73 . at a neutrino factory",
    ", one would observe @xmath74 event / yr , thus offering the possibility of a good determination of the gpd .",
    "the focus of studies of the structure of hadrons is currently moving toward either precision measurements (  for parton distributions ) or rare processes ( for generalized parton distributions ) .",
    "both are well served by the peculiar features of a neutrino beam , namely the availability of a probe which depends both on spin and flavor .",
    "the physics potential of such a beam can only be exploited given high enough intensity . however",
    ", a high intensity neutrino beam opens the possibility to a class of measurements which are essentially impossible at any other facility .",
    "even though the time scale for a neutrino factory is greater than ten years , it is unlikely that many relevant issues of hadron physics , such as the proton spin puzzle , will find a satisfactory experimental answer elsewhere .",
