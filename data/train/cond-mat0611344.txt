    "several theoretical studies employing the tight - binding model and density functional theory ( dft ) have been devoted to graphitic ribbons  @xcite and indicate that both charge localisation and paramagnetism occur in ribbons with zig - zag edges  @xcite .",

    "room temperature ferromagnetism requires that long range order exists amongst the localised spin moments , of such a strength as to survive significant thermal fluctuations .",

    "a carbon atom in the bulk has two intrachain bonds and one interchain ( rung ) bond with its nearest neighbours ; at the edge only intrachain bonds are present .",
    "the edge relaxation consists of a uniform contraction ( by 0.02    in the case of @xmath7=10 ) of the intrachain bonds at the edge and a consequent expansion of the interchain rungs .",
    "this effect decrease sharply moving away from the edge and is to be ascribed to the accumulation of extra bonding charge ( with respect to the bulk @xmath4 bonds ) at the non - bonding part of the @xmath4 orbital at the edge .",
    "contrary to the peierls distortion in polyacetylene , not all the non - bonding charge at the edge participates in this extra bonding due to the lack of a bonding counterpart at the atom involved in an interchain bond .",

    "this critical width is very large , indicating that the screening of the perturbation caused by the presence of the edges is very slow compared to , for instance , the screening of an electronic perturbation at the surface of semiconducting crystals ( typically around 10 nm ) .",
    "the much larger penetration depth in graphitic ribbons could be related to the large delocalization energy ( hopping parameter t @xmath33 2.5 ev ) typical of carbon aromatic systems , as well as to their dimensionality .",

    "the energy difference between the non - magnetic and the antiferromagnetic states plotted in fig .  [ me ] is a measure of the strength of the magnetic instability .",
    "the stabilisation is larger for wider ribbons and converges to about 0.38 ev per unit cell at @xmath35 . unlike the idealised system presented here , however ,",
    "realistic systems are likely to present a mixture of zig - zag and armchair edges . since the armchair edges do not give rise to a high density of states at the fermi level@xcite , the magnetic instability computed here for the idealised system is likely to be overestimated with respect to the systems experimentally realised thus far .",
    "the ground state of the system is found to be the af case , as predicted by the spin alternation rule discussed elsewhere @xcite and formally expressed in lieb s theorem  @xcite in the framework of a hubbard model .",

    "these results , therefore , extend the validity of the spin alternation rule beyond the approximations of the hubbard model .    the analysis of the electronic structure and energetics of these two stable magnetic states as a function of the ribbon s width documents the range of the magnetic interaction between the edges and the nature of the stabilisation mechanism via spin polarisation . in fig .

    "all such states , however , converge to the spin - polarised solution . if the proportion of fock exchange included in the hybrid functional",
    "is increased from 20% ( i.e. the percentage of fock exchange present in b3lyp ) , a metastable cp state is only achieved at the extreme limit of 100% which corresponds to uhf with a lyp treatment of correlation .",
    "it seems that this extreme limit produces an unphysical instabilty and indeed it is found that both the 100@xmath58 fock exchange functional and uhf theory predict the fm state to be the ground state for larger ribbon widths which is inconsistent with all other results and clashes with lieb s theorem and the spin alternation rule .",
    "in this work , the possible stabilisation mechanisms for a zig - zag ribbon via geometric distortion , spin polarisation and charge polarisation have been investigated .",
    "the influence of the ribbon s width on the electronic structure and relative stability of the different solutions were also analysed .",
    "the topology of the non - bonding crystalline orbitals at the edges does not allow for a significant peierls distortion for ribbons with n greater than 3 but rather an edge relaxation which preserves a strong tendency of the system to stabilise through a magnetic polarisation , where magnetic moments are localised at the edges .",
    "two magnetic states were investigated : ( i ) an antiferromagnetic configuration where the spin moments on the c atoms at one edge are antialigned to those on the other edge ; ( ii ) a ferromagnetic configuration where all spin moments on the c atoms at the edges point in the same direction .",
    "both states were found to be lower in energy than the non - magnetic state for any width of the ribbons .",
    "the antiferromagnetic state was found to be the ground state in agreement with the spin alternation rule and extending lieb s theorem beyond the nearest neighbour approximation .",
    "the magnetic state was found to be about 0.38 ev per unit cell more stable than the diamagnetic one for wide ribbons . in ribbons that have been realised",
    "thus far there is a mixture of zig - zag and magnetically inactive edges which weaken the tendency towards a magnetic state .",
    "this is a possible explanation of the recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiment in which niimi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured a peak in the local density of states ( ldos ) of edge atoms signalling the existence of a non - magnetic metallic state ( fig  [ nsbands ] ) .",
    "in fact , if the system were magnetic , the ldos at the edge would have shown two symmetric peaks around the fermi level representing the opening of a hubbard gap due to the magnetic polarisation of the @xmath4 system , as discussed in session  [ sp ] .    by fitting the antiferromagnetic band structure to a nearest neighbour hubbard model",
    "the value of the @xmath38 parameter associated with the localised states at the edges was found to be dependent on the exchange - correlation functional used .",
    "going from gga and lsda to b3lyp the @xmath38 value increases due to the explicit inclusion of a self - interaction correcting term in the dft hamiltonian .",
    "the self - interaction error is known to be the main cause of the failure of the lsda and gga in the treatment of systems containing localised @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "however it is not clear at present which treatment of exchange and correlation provides the most reliable approach for a system containing localised / atomic - like @xmath59 orbitals .",
    "the magnetic interaction strength was computed as a function of the ribbon width and , within the b3lyp functional , it was found that ribbons less than 1.5 - 2 nm across retain magnetic order above room temperature . within lsda and",
    "gga the magnetic interaction strength is weaker but longer ranged .",
    "these three functionals provide differing descriptions of the interplay between localisation and delocalisation and its effect on the strength and range of the magnetic interaction .",
    "this is evident in the predicted critical ribbon width at which the magnetic state becomes thermally unstable at room temperature ; b3lyp predicts a critical width of 1 - 2 nm while lsda and gga predict a width an order of magnitude smaller .    in conclusion ,",
    "first principles calculations have been used to establish that the electronic structure of graphene ribbons with zig - zag edges is unstable with respect to a magnetic polarisation of the edge states .",
    "this mechanism is stable with respect to alternative stablisation routes involving charge polarisation or structural distortions .",
    "the magnetic interaction of the edge states is remarkably long ranged .",
    "a band gap in the bulk of the ribbon exists in the antiferromagnetically alligned ground state with the size of the gap also displaying a very long ranged dependence on the ribbon width closing , at room room temperature for ribbon widths exceeding 80 nm .",
    "the qualitative features of these results are robust with respect to differing treatments of electronic exchange and correlation .",
    "this explicit demonstration of the long ranged nature of the magnetic interaction mediated by the delocalised @xmath4 orbitals in graphitic systems is consistent with recent observations of magnetism induced by low defect concentrations in a number of materials .",
    "these results have direct implications for the control of the spin dependent conductance in graphitic nano - ribbons using suitably modulated magnetic fields .",
    "this work is supported by the european union under the nest ferrocarbon project ( cec 012881 ) .",
