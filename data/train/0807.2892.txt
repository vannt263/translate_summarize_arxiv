    "in spite of the progress reached so far in understanding of the key role of magnetic reconnection in many phenomena of space and laboratory plasmas , its quantitative description in realistic three - dimensional ( 3d ) configurations still remains a challenge @xcite .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the global aspects of reconnection such as an identification of reconnected magnetic fluxes and related structural changes in solar coronal configurations .",
    "there are basically two fundamental reasons why this important problem is so complicated in the 3d case .",
    "first , by analogy with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , one could assume that partitioning the configurations into distinct interacting magnetic fluxes by separatrix surfaces ( sss ) and estimating their time variation might help to resolve this problem . and ,",
    "indeed , this idea works very well whenever such sss are due to the presence of magnetic null points ( nps ) in the solar corona ",
    "the np sss are boundless surfaces , and so they provide the required partition . however , the situation is different if the sss are due to the presence of so - called bald patches ( bps ) , which are the segments of the photospheric polarity inversion line where coronal field lines touch the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the bp sss are usually not boundless and , therefore , not able to provide the required partition of the respective configurations .",
    "it is also important that they are not exceptional structures , but are highly likely to be present in practice in the complex configurations that exist in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "moreover , the set of 3d structural features where reconnection may occur is even wider than mentioned above , because it includes also quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) @xcite .",
    "similar to bp sss , these qsls also do not provide an exact partition of configurations into distinct magnetic fluxes .",
    "the second fundamental difficulty in quantitative description of 3d reconnection is related to magnetic diffusion and the breakdown of frozen - flux behavior .",
    "being an inherent part of the reconnection itself , magnetic diffusion in 3d can occur throughout the plasma volume in evolving configurations .",
    "this is of particular importance for numerical mhd simulations , which may presently be performed only with a relatively high numerical or physical diffusion compared to real solar conditions .",
    "deviations from the frozen - in law condition are accumulated in this case throughout the volume to form a background against which it becomes difficult to distinguish between magnetic diffusion and reconnection .",
    "nevertheless , significant progress in understanding 3d reconnection has been achieved in the framework of general magnetic reconnection ( gmr ) theory @xcite , which is focused on the analysis of magnetic field evolution constrained only by maxwell s equations and ohm s law . on the basis of this theory ,",
    "@xcite have recently shown that , regardless of the presence of certain structural magnetic features , the time change of the reconnected magnetic flux is always directly related to the maximum of the field - line integral of parallel electric field . for a plasma - magnetic configuration contained in a closed volume ,",
    "this means that the change of the magnetic connection between the boundary plasma elements is fully controlled by the voltage drop along these lines .",
    "it is clear , however , that such a change of the magnetic connection can always be found without calculating the electric field if the magnetic field in the volume and the plasma flows on the boundary are known at every moment .",
    "as will be shown , the theory based on this premise complements the gmr theory by providing new intriguing opportunities for the analysis of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a general mathematical formalism that allows one to describe the change of magnetic connectivity and identify the reconnecting magnetic fluxes in any evolving configuration .",
    "the new theory has been outlined earlier by @xcite .",
    "this paper , however , provides its full exposition .",
    "the new formalism can also be viewed as a generalization of the theory of coronal magnetic connectivity , whose spatial variation is measured with the help of the so - called squashing factor @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity was introduced first for closed magnetic configurations with a plane photospheric boundary @xcite and then extended to other configurations with arbitrary shapes of the boundaries @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 factor allows one to identify in a given configuration at a fixed time all the structural magnetic features , such as sss and qsls as well as their hybrids .",
    "here we generalize this quantity in order to characterize the evolution of magnetic connectivity by applying the @xmath0 factor to so - called slip mapping ",
    "the mapping that describes the slippage between boundary plasma elements and footpoints of magnetic field lines .",
    "it was previously noticed by @xcite for 2d magnetic configurations that the speed with which the photosphere is swept by a magnetic separatrix line allows one to estimate the electric field at the reconnection site .",
    "@xcite have also proposed strong arguments that this principle can be extended to 3d as well , excluding the above - mentioned configurations with qsls , if one focuses only on the amount of magnetic flux reconnected up to a particular instant of time .",
    "our paper provides exactly this type of generalization of the principle for 3d configurations with qsls included .",
    "section [ s : evol ] describes the general theory of evolution of magnetic connectivity , which is illustrated in section [ s : exmpl1 ] for the example of magnetic evolution proposed earlier by @xcite .",
    "section [ s : exmpl2 ] presents another example of magnetic evolution in a current layer configuration to show the difference between reconnection and magnetic diffusion . in section [ s : min ] , we discuss the general properties of magnetic minimum points , which happen to be closely related to the considered theory .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in section [ s : sum ] .",
    "the basic concept that makes it possible to define the frozen - in law and its violation in magnetized - plasma flows is the connection of plasma elements by magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "when trying to characterize the magnetic structure and its evolution , we find it extremely useful to apply this concept to the plasma elements that are currently located at the boundary of a given configuration .",
    "the magnetic field lines threading the plasma volume generally start and end up at some pieces of the boundary with the coordinate charts @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( figure [ f : f1 ] ) . in this way",
    ", they define a mapping @xmath3 determined by some vector function @xmath4 from one piece of the boundary to the other .",
    "the local properties of this mapping are described by the jacobian matrix @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{d }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each field line , this matrix determines a linear mapping from the tangent plane at the launch footpoint to the tangent plane at the target footpoint , so that a circle in the first plane is mapped into an ellipse in the second plane ( figure [ f : f1 ] ) .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath6 of such an ellipse defines the degree of local squashing of elemental flux tubes , which means that any infinitesimal circle centered at a given launch point is mapped along the field lines into an infinitesimal ellipse with this aspect ratio at the target footpoint .",
    "+    the value @xmath6 is invariant with respect to the direction of the field - line mapping and so it can be used for characterizing the spatial variation of magnetic connectivity .",
    "it turns out , however , that @xmath7 provides a more compact expression in terms of coordinates and practically coincides with @xmath6 in the most interesting cases where it is large .",
    "so it is natural to use the value @xmath0 , called the squashing degree @xcite or squashing factor , for characterizing the local properties of magnetic connection between the boundary elements .",
    "the @xmath0 factor can be expressed in terms of the norm @xmath8 @xcite and jacobian @xmath9 of the field - line mapping as follows @xmath10 it is convenient for further consideration to rewrite the covariant expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 found by @xcite for an arbitrary shape of the boundary in the following matrix form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the normal components of the magnetic field at the conjugate launch and target footpoints , respectively , and @xmath14      \\label{g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the matrix of the covariant metric at the launch footpoints with @xmath15 denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the radius - vector @xmath17 defining the shape of the boundary in a chosen coordinate chart @xmath1 is assumed here to be known .",
    "the latter equally refers to the boundary at the target footpoints with radius - vector @xmath18 , where the matrix of the covariant metric is @xmath19^ { * } .",
    "\\label{g*}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the asterisk symbol ( superscript ) indicates here that the values of @xmath20 refer to the conjugate target footpoints such that @xmath21 . in other words ,",
    "the asterisk symbol pulls back the values of @xmath20 from the target to the launch footpoints at which the @xmath0 factor is evaluated .",
    "if the magnetic field @xmath22 is defined analytically or on some numerical grid , the jacobian matrix ( [ d ] ) can be straightforwardly computed from the coordinates of the target footpoints that are obtained by integrating the field - line equation @xmath23 with the initial condition at launch footpoints @xmath24 and the stopping condition at target footpoints @xmath25 which are satisfied by some parameter values @xmath26 to be found .",
    "tracing of the field lines should be done with a sufficiently high accuracy to make the subsequent calculation of the coordinate derivatives accurate enough .",
    "although such computations are relatively time consuming , they may be fulfilled with a very good resolution even for the entire solar corona without using supercomputers @xcite .",
    "the latter are required only for numerical modeling of the coronal magnetic field itself .",
    "for example , such a computation for the given magnetic field data on a mac pro with one processor intel xeon ( 2ghz ) requires only 23 hr .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 factor is obtained on a uniform grid with 3600 and 7200 mesh points in latitude and longitude , respectively , for a magnetic field defined in spherical coordinates @xmath27 on a nonuniform grid with 174 x 118 x 174 mesh points .    as mentioned in section [",
    "s : intro ] , the @xmath0 factor allows one to identify in a given configuration all topological and geometrical magnetic features at a fixed time instant .",
    "formally , the sss are distinguished from the qsls by infinite rather than large finite values of @xmath0 . however , from a numerical point of view , these features are similar , since they are both identified via large finite values of @xmath0 .",
    "the only difference is that the maxima of @xmath0 increase at sss limitlessly with a decreasing size of a numerical grid used for computing @xmath0 , while at qsls such maxima converge to certain large values .",
    "such a subtle difference is usually not important for applications and so , for brevity , we will use hereafter the term qsls in a broad sense to include also sss , unless it is stated otherwise .",
    "if the evolution of magnetic configurations is subject to the frozen - in law , the initial connection of plasma elements by magnetic field lines remains unchanged .",
    "the analysis of magnetic connectivity then is significantly simplified , because the field - line mapping @xmath28 at any time @xmath29 can be composed in this case as follows : @xmath30 where the superscript ",
    "ie \" stands for the  ideal evolution \" , @xmath31 is the initial field - line mapping , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are tangential boundary flows , forward and backward in time , respectively ( see figure [ f : f2 ] ) .",
    "this means that for any footpoint p , its conjugate footpoint @xmath34 can generally be found by following the lower path of the diagram @xmath35 in other words , instead of tracing the field line that connects p and @xmath36 at time @xmath29 ( see figure [ f : f2 ] ) , one can first trace the trajectory of p backward in time to find its initial prototype @xmath37 , then tracing from it the field line of the initial configuration find its conjugate prototype @xmath38 , and finally tracing the trajectory from @xmath38 forward in time find @xmath36 .",
    "such a three - step calculation of the field - line mapping allows one to avoid the use of magnetic field data except for the initial data .",
    "thus , whenever the tangential boundary flows and the initial magnetic field are known , the squashing factor may be calculated for any time moment without computing the ideal mhd evolution of configuration itself .",
    "this is very important if one takes into account the results of numerical mhd simulations @xcite that demonstrate a good correlation between regions with a highly distorted field - line mapping and strong current concentrations . in the light of this , we conjecture that equation ( [ pit ] ) must provide a powerful tool for predicting favorable sites of current - layer formation in magnetic configurations whose evolution is subject to the frozen - in law .",
    "its first successful application to a particular configuration with two twisted magnetic flux spots @xcite strongly supports this conjecture .    in coordinate notations , the field - line mapping defined by equation ( [ pit ] )",
    "is described as @xmath39 where the coordinate functions and their values are denoted by the same letters but different cases  the upper - case letters represent the functions , while the low - case letters represent their values ; the functions and coordinates referring to the initial time moment are marked with the subscript 0 .",
    "thus , for example , the flow @xmath33 maps @xmath40 to ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) and so on .",
    "the second step in this composition requires solving of the problem described by equations ( [ fle])([scfle ] ) , with the proviso that this problem is set for the initial configuration , whose boundary coordinates are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the first and third steps of composition ( [ ptc ] ) require tracing of the footpoint trajectories , which are determined from the tangential components of the boundary velocity field @xmath45 , assumed to be known .",
    "specifically , one needs to solve the following two initial value problems . for the first step , the system @xmath46 should be integrated _",
    "backward _ in time from @xmath29 to 0 , while , for the third step , the system @xmath47 should be integrated _ forward _ in time from @xmath48 to @xmath29 . in both these systems , summation over the repeating index @xmath49 is assumed ; the contravariant metric @xmath50 \\equiv g^{-1}$ ] refers to points of the launch and target boundaries for equations ( [ u0eq ] ) and ( [ weq ] ) , respectively .",
    "the double - asterisk symbol ( in the superscript ) in equation ( [ wic ] ) indicates that the point @xmath44 is the image of @xmath1 that is obtained at the first two steps of composition ( [ ptc ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the double asterisks provide a double pull back of this point to the launch boundary , where @xmath0 is evaluated .",
    "this convention will be used hereafter for other values as well , with the extension to a triple pull back denoted by triple asterisks , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the first and third steps in the procedure described above are no more difficult than the second step . in principle , making consecutively these three steps at least three times in the small neighborhood of a given launch point , one can evaluate numerically the jacobian matrix ( [ d ] ) and the respective value of @xmath0 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ q])([g * ] ) ] . in practice",
    ", however , the divergence of the field lines at qsls of the initial configuration can be so high that it may significantly affect the accuracy of such an evaluation .",
    "a better control of the accuracy in this procedure is obtained by using the fact that the jacobian matrix @xmath51 of the compositeideal \" mapping ( [ pit ] ) is the product of the jacobian matrices of the individual mappings , namely @xmath52^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } } _ { m^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } }    \\underbrace {      \\left [ \\frac{\\partial w^{p}_{0}}{\\partial u^{s}_{0 } } \\right]^ { * } } _ { d^{*}_{0 } }    \\underbrace {      \\left [ \\frac{\\partial u^{s}_{0}}{\\partial u^{j}}\\right ] } _ { m^{-1 } } .",
    "\\label{dc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the calculation of @xmath53 is reduced to the calculations of these three matrices at the points that  lie on the path \" of the composite mapping . as stated above ,",
    "each of these calculations is similar to one another , and none of them requires knowledge of the magnetic field , except at the initial moment .    it is clear from this consideration that the respective squashing factor @xmath54 can be obtained now by modifying equations ( [ q])([dlt ] ) as follows : @xmath55 the determinant of the product of the individual matrices in this expression can be rewritten as a product of the corresponding individual determinants . using also conservation of the magnetic flux in the initial configuration ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath56 we used here the fact that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the normal components of the initial field at the corresponding conjugate footpoints , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 at such points .",
    "the breaking of the frozen - in law causes a change of the initial magnetic connection of the boundary plasma elements . in other words , such elements experience , in this case , a slippage relative to their ideal mhd mapping",
    "this intuitive notion can be formalized by introducing two types of mapping , which relate two time moments 0 and @xmath29 in the evolution of a given magnetic configuration .",
    "the first of them , denoted by @xmath62 and expressed as @xmath63 maps the boundary onto itself at the initial time @xmath48 .",
    "we will call this the _ slip - forth mapping _ because the slippage of footpoints occurs _",
    "forward _ in time . the second mapping describes a corresponding slippage _",
    "backward _ in time and it is expressed as @xmath64 and called the _ slip - back mapping_. this expression also maps the boundary onto itself but at the final time @xmath29 , so that the slip - back mapping is an antipode to the slip - forth mapping .",
    "a pointwise definition of these mappings is depicted in figure [ f : f3 ] for the case of a closed magnetic configuration .",
    "the picture can be easily modified , however , to represent more general configurations comprising both closed and open field lines by simply enclosing the coronal volume under study with the help of an additional upper boundary surface .",
    "comparing equations ( [ sbm ] ) and ( [ pit ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 which means that the slip - back mapping is just a composite of the  real \" and  ideal \" field - line mappings at time @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , equation ( [ sfm ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is that initial field - line mapping whose ideal evolution driven by the flow @xmath32 would produce at time @xmath29 the final field - line mapping @xmath68 .",
    "thus , both slip mappings identify the differences in the field - line connectivities of the  real \" and  ideal \" configurations . the slip - forth mapping @xmath62 , however , does this for the initial observer , while the slip - back mapping @xmath69 does the same for the final observer .",
    "this consideration also shows that the footpoint slippage that will occur or has occurred within time @xmath29 is fully determined by the magnetic fields at the initial and final moments and by the respective displacements of the plasma elements due to tangential boundary flows .",
    "such a slippage is caused by both magnetic reconnection and resistive plasma diffusion , whose contributions may generally be comparable in value .",
    "yet it is clear that magnetic reconnection is more localized in space than resistive diffusion @xcite .",
    "one can expect therefore that these two processes are discriminated not by the magnitude of the slippage itself but rather by its spatial gradient .",
    "note also that the introduced slip mappings are very similar to the field - line mapping in the sense that all of them are just two - dimensional mappings of the boundary on itself .",
    "thinking by analogy , we can assume then that the squashing factor is a major characteristic not only for a field - line mapping but also for slip mappings .",
    "this assumption is fully confirmed by our further analysis , which shows that in the case of slip mappings the squashing factor makes it possible to identify the reconnecting magnetic flux tubes in any evolving configuration , even if its evolution involves a substantial resistive diffusion .",
    "in particular , section [ s : exmpl2 ] presents an example of magnetic evolution in a current layer with a small nonideal region inside .",
    "it shows that the transition from magnetic diffusion to reconnection is not abrupt but continuous .",
    "the reconnecting flux tubes here pass through , and in the vicinity of , the nonideal region and they are distinguished , as expected , by high values of the squashing factor that are related to a locally enhanced current density . to derive the required expressions ,",
    "let us first represent the slip mappings in coordinate notations .",
    "for the slip - forth mapping defined by equation ( [ sfm ] ) , we have @xmath70 so that its jacobian matrix is determined by the following product of individual jacobian matrices : @xmath71 =    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial u^{i}_{0}}{\\partial u^{p }     } \\right]^{{\\raisebox{+0.2em}{$\\scriptstyle * \\hspace{-0.6pt}*$ }    \\hspace{-0.52em } \\raisebox{-0.07em}{$\\scriptstyle * $ } } } }      _ { m^{-1{\\raisebox{+0.15em}[1pt]{$\\scriptscriptstyle * \\hspace{-0.7pt}*$ }    \\hspace{-0.46em } \\raisebox{-0.05em}{$\\scriptscriptstyle * $ } } } }    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial u^{p }     } { \\partial w^{q }     } \\right]^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } }      _ { d^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } }    \\underbrace {       \\left[\\frac{\\partial w^{q }     } { \\partial w^{s}_{0}}\\right]^ { *   } }      _ { m^ { * } }    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial w^{s}_{0}}{\\partial u^{j}_{0}}\\right]^ {    } }      _ { d_{0 } }      \\label{dsf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this composition implies that the respective squashing factor @xmath72 can be derived from suitably modified equations ( [ q])([dlt ] ) as follows : @xmath73 rewriting the denominator in this expression as a product of individual determinants of the entering matrices and using conservation of a magnetic flux in the initial and final configurations , we finally obtain @xmath74    similarly , the slip - back mapping defined by equation ( [ sbm ] ) is represented in coordinates by @xmath75 so that its jacobian matrix is determined by the following product of individual jacobian matrices : @xmath76 =    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial u^{i }     } { \\partial u^{p}_{0}}\\right]^{{\\raisebox{+0.2em}{$\\scriptstyle * \\hspace{-0.6pt}*$ }    \\hspace{-0.52em } \\raisebox{-0.07em}{$\\scriptstyle * $ } } } }    _ { m^{{\\raisebox{+0.15em}[1pt]{$\\scriptscriptstyle * \\hspace{-0.7pt}*$ }    \\hspace{-0.46em } \\raisebox{-0.05em}{$\\scriptscriptstyle * $ } } } }    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial u^{p}_{0}}{\\partial w^{q}_{0}}\\right]^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } }    _ { d_{0}^ { { * \\hspace{-0.6pt } * } } }    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial w^{q}_{0}}{\\partial w^{s }     } \\right]^ { *   } }    _ { m^{-1 * } }    \\underbrace {      \\left[\\frac{\\partial w^{s }     } { \\partial u^{j }     } \\right ]       }    _ { d } .",

    "from the physical point of view , this is actually the most interesting situation , because it corresponds to the case where magnetic reconnection going on in the volume is so quick on the time scale under study that the boundary motion of plasma can be neglected .",

    "such configurations , however , require special consideration , and so the discussion of them is postponed to section [ s : rec_ft ] .",

    "equations ( [ qsfa ] ) and ( [ qsba ] ) suggest that such a reconnection front should approximately coincide with the set of qsls existing at a present moment ( see an example in section [ s : exmpl1 ] ) . however , the situation is different for the second rf , which is called _ the future rf _ or _ past rf _ , respectively , for the slip - forth or slip - back mapping .",
    "the future rf consists of those initial flux tubes whose footprints will turn after reconnection into the footprints of the final qsls .",
    "the past rf consists of those final flux tubes whose footprints are formed by reconnection from the footprints of the initial qsls .",
    "these definitions of rfs are slightly modified if the advection of footpoints is essential in the evolution under study .",
    "it might seem surprising at first glance that our description of magnetic reconnection does not invoke an electric field at all , even though the component of the electric field parallel to a magnetic field is at the cornerstone of the gmr theory @xcite .",
    "the physical ground for this omission of the electric field becomes clear if one recalls that its parallel component appears generally in very strong current layers ( cls ) , in particular , when the corresponding resistive voltage drop is not negligible .",
    "however , qsls are likely to be favorable sites for the formation of strong cls under very general conditions @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to put qsls at the core of general reconnection theory by reformulating it in purely geometrical terms .",
    "such a reformulation has the advantage of being able to directly relate the reconnection process with an accompanying variation of the structure of evolving magnetic configurations .",
    "more details illustrating these general statements are given in sections [ s : exmpl1 ] and [ s : exmpl2 ] .",
    "what is particularly important is that our approach enables us to identify reconnecting flux tubes in a given magnetic evolution as well as to estimate the reconnected fluxes by tracing the footprints of the rfs . to describe this",
    "more precisely , let us introduce first the lines going along the ridges of the @xmath0 distributions by denoting such lines as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , for the field - line and slip mappings .",
    "qss abbreviates here a quasi - separatrix surface , which is a magnetic surface passing through the ridge of the respective @xmath0 distribution at the boundary .",
    "qsss play the role of the middle surfaces for qsls [ see some examples of qsss in @xcite ] , so that @xmath82 lines serve as midlines for the footprints of qsls .",
    "similarly , the @xmath83 lines serve as midlines for the footprints of rfs .",
    "consider first the simplest case , where the advection of the footpoints is negligible in comparison with their displacements due to reconnection , which means that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are approximately identity mappings in composition ( [ sfm_c ] ) .",
    "assume in addition that there are qsls at both time moments and that their footprints are sufficiently separated in distance .",
    "this implies that the squashing of the @xmath62 mapping on its composite path passing through a given footprint of the qsl is mainly provided by the field - line mapping corresponding to this qsl . by noticing also that @xmath84",
    ", we obtain then from relation ( [ sfm_c ] ) that @xmath85 where the subscripts @xmath48 or @xmath29 correspond , respectively , to instantaneous or future rfs , while the superscripts @xmath86 or @xmath87 denote the positive or negative magnetic polarity , to which the @xmath83- or @xmath82 line belongs .",
    "these equalities establish a direct relationship between rfs and qsls and provide a simplified algorithm for determining rfs in the described situation . as discussed in section [ s : intro ] , qsss and boundary surfaces do not necessarily bound closed volumes in the corona , and so @xmath88- and @xmath89 lines might not form closed contours at the boundary .",
    "the latter may happen , however , if qsss , for example , turn out to be np sss . in this case , the closed contours , formed by @xmath88- and @xmath89 lines , outline in the initial configuration the footprints of the flux tubes that will reconnect within time @xmath29 .",
    "we will call them _ to - be - reconnected _ magnetic flux tubes . in a more general situation with open @xmath83 lines ,",
    "the footprints of to - be - reconnected flux tubes are the boundary areas that are swept by @xmath89 lines in the initial configuration with time running from @xmath48 to @xmath29 .",
    "the integral of the normal component of the initial magnetic field over such areas determines the magnetic fluxes that will be reconnected within time @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the @xmath83 lines play a crucial role in determining the reconnecting magnetic fluxes  the more accurately we determine the geometry and kinematics of the @xmath83 lines , the better we can quantify the reconnecting flux tubes for a given magnetic evolution .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand also what happens if the reconnection is not fast enough to neglect the advection of footpoints . to understand this question ,",
    "let us turn again to equation ( [ sfm_c ] ) and its more compact form ( [ sfm_sh])([pi0 ] ) , from where one can see that the location of @xmath88 lines should be given by equation ( [ sf_rffp_0 ] ) if the paths of @xmath62 [ see eq .",
    "( [ sfm_c ] ) ] , on which the field - line mappings @xmath31 or @xmath90 are mostly distorted , are different .",
    "the latter is probably valid if the time interval @xmath29 under study is not too small and so the footprints of qsls of the @xmath31 or @xmath90 mappings do not overlap each other .",
    "yet the situation with the @xmath89 lines is more complicated , even if the latter is true .",
    "the answer in this case depends on whether or not the boundary flows @xmath32 and @xmath33 significantly interlock or unlock the field lines in the volume of the final magnetic configuration .",
    "this , in turn , depends on whether or not these flows contain substantial shearing motions applied in transverse directions to the conjugate footprints of qsls . because a twisting pair of such shearing motions is able to seriously modify the @xmath90 mapping compared to the @xmath68 mapping .",
    "in fact , this kind of advection can even destroy the original qsl or , in contrast , it can create a new one , depending on the sign of the twist and the resulting values of shear @xcite .",
    "if such an interlocking or unlocking effect of the boundary flows is small ( but the footpoint advection is still not negligible ) , the @xmath89 lines can be approximated by @xmath91 otherwise , one needs to use a more accurate approximation , namely , @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the @xmath82 lines of the @xmath90 mapping defined by equation ( [ pi0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the sequence of equations ( [ sf_rffp_ta1 ] ) , ( [ sf_rffp_ta2 ] ) and ( [ sf_rffp_ta3 ] ) provides more and more accurate approximations of the @xmath89 lines of the slip - forth mapping with respect to its distortion by footpoint advection .    using equations ( [ sbm_c ] ) , ( [ sbm_sh ] ) , and ( [ sbm ] )",
    ", a similar sequence of approximations can be found for the rfs of the slip - back mapping . in the case of a negligible footpoint advection ,",
    "one obtains that the @xmath83 lines of the instantaneous and past rfs , respectively , are given by @xmath94 if footpoint advection is not negligible but capable of producing only a moderate distortion of the slip - back mapping , the @xmath83 lines of the past rfs should be determined by @xmath95 the presence of substantial interlocking or unlocking shears in the boundary motion requires , however , even a more accurate approximation , namely , @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the @xmath82 lines of the @xmath28 mapping in the corresponding polarities . with time running backward , the @xmath98 lines of the instantaneous rf will remain practically unchanged [ see equation ( [ sb_rffp_t ] ) ] , while the @xmath99 lines of the past rf will change and move on the boundary by sweeping the footprints of the flux tubes that have been reconnected within the time @xmath29 under study .",
    "the evolving topology of these @xmath83 lines and footprints may be rather non - trivial , since the reconnection process may generally occur at different moments and places in the configuration by causing changes in its structure .",
    "such an intimate link of reconnection to the magnetic structure is expressed by the above approximate relationships between the @xmath83 and @xmath82 lines .",
    "the accuracy of these relationships can always be proved by using exact expressions ( [ qsf ] ) and ( [ qsb ] ) for the slip - squashing factors . but even using these exact expressions , the reconnected or to - be - reconnected magnetic fluxes may be estimated only approximately .",
    "the reason for this is that , in general , there is no strict difference between reconnection and magnetic diffusion , because the diffusion is always a part of the reconnection process . in our formulation",
    ", this fact manifests itself in an inherent uncertainty of the end points of the unclosed @xmath83 lines .",
    "such end points can be identified by some threshold value @xmath100 of the slip - squashing factors .",
    "physically , this value is the degree of squashing of the elemental flux tubes that start at the end points of the @xmath83 lines and pass through the border of the reconnection region . since the location of this border",
    "is defined up to a fraction of the thickness of the reconnecting current layer , the threshold values @xmath100 and the end points of the unclosed @xmath83 lines also can not be defined exactly .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the most accurate method for estimating them seems to rely on the voltage drop at the initial and final moments along the magnetic field lines that belong to the paths of the slip mappings starting at the respective @xmath83 lines .",
    "analyzing the distribution of this voltage drop along the @xmath83 lines would give us the most precise criterion for the end points of these lines  they would be simply the points where the voltage drop decreases to a fixed fraction of its nearest maximum at the @xmath83 line .",
    "however , such an approach requires additional computations involving additional data on electric fields in a given magnetic evolution , which seems to be hardly justifiable from the practical point of view .",
    "the final result obtained by this electric field method will still not be unique but dependent on the threshold value of the voltage drop that is selected .",
    "in this situation , it seems to be more practical to choose some large value of @xmath100 for identifying the end points of the @xmath83 lines by keeping in mind that the final result depends on the chosen @xmath100 .",
    "it should be emphasized that such an ambiguity of our method appears only in the case of the unclosed parts of the @xmath83 lines  their closed parts provide an unambiguous description of the reconnection process ( see an example in section [ s : exmpl1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the closed @xmath83 lines seem to appear less often than the open ones .",
    "there may also be the cases , where the transverse displacements of the @xmath83 lines are negligible , so that the @xmath83 lines evolve mainly by changing their length ( see an example in section [ s : exmpl2 ] ) .",
    "the reconnecting magnetic fluxes in such cases should be determined via the corresponding rf footprints defined at the boundary as areas with the slip - squashing factors larger than @xmath100 .",
    "thus , this generalized definition of reconnecting flux tubes also does depend on @xmath100 , which reflects an inherent property of the reconnection process in general 3d configurations .",
    "let us illustrate now our theory of reconnection by considering a particular example of magnetic field evolution .",
    "for this purpose , we choose the evolving configuration analyzed previously by @xcite with the help of the gmr theory , whose major element is a nonvanishing voltage drop along the reconnecting magnetic field lines .",
    "the consideration of this example will significantly facilitate a comparison between the two theories .    in a cartesian system of",
    "coordinates @xmath101 , the corresponding components of the magnetic field are given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are length - scale parameters , and @xmath105 is a monotonically growing function of time @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 are swapped , so that the plane @xmath108 corresponds to the photosphere . also the power degree 2 is recovered in the denominator of the second term in @xmath109 to correct a misprint in the original formula .",
    "only the @xmath109 component evolves with time via the function @xmath110 , whose time derivative @xmath111 is assumed here to be strictly positive .",
    "this implies the presence of an electric field with a nonvanishing component @xmath112 such that faraday s law for the evolving @xmath109 is satisfied .    by construction",
    ", @xmath113 is nonvanishing and constant , so that the magnetic field ( [ bx])([bz ] ) has no null points .",
    "it is easy to prove also that , for the assumed @xmath110 , @xmath114 at the photospheric polarity inversion line defined by @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the transverse field at this line is always directed from the positive to negative polarity , which , in turn , means @xcite that this configuration has no coronal field lines touching the photosphere .",
    "thus , under these assumptions , the topology of magnetic field lines remains trivial during the evolution of the configuration .",
    "nevertheless , its magnetic structure changes dramatically , which can be immediately seen from the evolution of the transverse magnetic field @xmath116 in the middle plane @xmath117 .",
    "note that the field lines of @xmath118 in this plane are contours of the function @xmath119 figure [ f : f4 ] shows several such field lines at two different instances corresponding to @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "they clearly demonstrate the formation of a magnetic island from the initial arcade - like configuration within the respective time interval .",
    "this 2d plot provides , of course , only a first glimpse of the evolution of the magnetic structure , which is in fact fully three - dimensional , since the vector field @xmath122 depends on all three coordinates .",
    "this suggests , however , that the minimum points of @xmath123 might help to characterize the evolving magnetic structure . in this approach",
    ", the formation of the magnetic island in the 2d plane can be viewed as a bifurcation of the cusp - type minimum into elliptic and hyperbolic minima .",
    "this point of view is confirmed by a closer inspection of equations ( [ bx])([by ] ) .",
    "indeed , one can see from them that the minima of @xmath123 coincide with the nulls of @xmath109 , whose locations are determined explicitly by @xmath124^{1/2 }          + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2(1+y^2/l_{y}^2 ) } - 1         \\right\\}^{1/2 } .",

    "the heights have real values only if @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 as @xmath130 increases from @xmath131 , a single minimum point of cusp - type @xmath132 bifurcates into two curves of elliptic and hyperbolic minima ( see figure [ f : f5 ] ) .",
    "it will be clear soon that some of these minima play a key role in the nonideal evolution of this configuration .    in a highly conducting plasma",
    ", the perpendicular component of an electric field @xmath133 mainly sustains the advection of plasma elements with a drift velocity @xmath134 . in our example",
    ", this component vanishes at the photosphere ( @xmath108 ) together with the total electric field @xmath135 [ see equation ( [ ey ] ) ] , which implies that the photospheric plasma elements remain at rest during the evolution of the configuration .",
    "it is of particular importance that , in the volume , there is a nonvanishing parallel electric field @xmath136 , whose presence in the configuration provides a slippage of the footpoints with respect to the stationary photospheric plasma elements .",
    "the latter was clearly demonstrated by @xcite , who have also shown that such a slippage is most intensive at the magnetic field lines with the highest values of the voltage drop , called by them pseudopotential .",
    "the latter is defined by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is an arc length of the magnetic field lines along which @xmath139 is integrated between their end points , so that @xmath140 is a function of these points . for convenience",
    ", we have reproduced the photospheric distribution of @xmath140 , the same as in @xcite , except that , in our case , @xmath139 was integrated along the entire magnetic field lines without a cutoff by the lateral and top boundaries of numerical box .",
    "this was done to eliminate the artificial distortion of the @xmath140 distribution due to such a boundary effect .",
    "the resulting @xmath140 distributions at @xmath141 and @xmath142 are shown , respectively , in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f : f6 ] .",
    "the second distribution differs only slightly from that calculated by @xcite , which means that the mentioned boundary effect is not large for the chosen size of the numerical box .",
    "for the same values of @xmath130 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ f : f6 ] present the photospheric distributions of the @xmath0 factor in a logarithmic scale with the gray shading saturated at @xmath143 . depending on the value of @xmath130 ,",
    "the actual maxima of @xmath144 in these distributions are two - three times larger than the saturation level .",
    "so the largest values of @xmath0 are concentrated here in extremely narrow ridges tracing the footprints of the corresponding qsss .",
    "comparison between the @xmath0 and @xmath140 distributions in figure [ f : f6 ] [ panels ( c ) and ( d ) vs. ( a ) and ( b ) ] shows that the footprints of the qsss pass exactly along the lines of the steepest gradient of @xmath140 , or , in other words , along the lines where the spatial variation of the footpoint slippage is the highest .",
    "this indicates that the respective qsls are indeed instantaneous rfs , as inferred in section [ s : rec_ft ] from the general argument .",
    "further confirmation of this fact is obtained by considering the corresponding distributions of the slip - squashing factors .    before starting such a consideration ,",
    "let us look first at the structure of the magnetic field lines in the vicinity of the qsss .",
    "figure [ f : f7]a shows a set of the field lines at @xmath141 with the launch points chosen to be very close to the cusp minimum point of @xmath145 .",
    "it is clearly seen there that the footpoints of these field lines are distributed exactly along the ridges of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "so such field lines approximate the qss by showing that it has a wedge - like shape with the sharpest corner at the cusp minimum point .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) in figure [ f : f7 ] depict a set of field lines at @xmath142 with the launch points near the loci of the hyperbolic minima of @xmath145 defined by equation ( [ zox ] ) .",
    "the footpoints of these field lines are also distributed exactly along the ridges of the corresponding @xmath0 distribution .",
    "so such field lines approximate the qss by demonstrating that it consists of two parts attached to each other .",
    "the lower part has a wedge - like shape with a sharp corner along the loci of the hyperbolic minima .",
    "the upper part is a tube - like surface enclosing a twisted flux rope that lies on the top of this wedge .",
    "it starts at the photosphere as a narrow , very flat , and almost untwisted flux tube spreading along the slopes of the wedge and blows up near the wedge corner into a very large , elongated , and highly twisted plasmoid .",
    "the cross section of the resulting qss by the middle plane @xmath117 coincides with the separatrix line of the transverse magnetic field shown in the right panel of figure [ f : f4 ] .",
    "thus , the qsls in our example are due to the presence of the hyperbolic or cusp minima of @xmath145this fact will be explained in section [ s : min ] from the general point of view .    in the strict sense , the oval - like parts of the @xmath82 lines ( fig .",
    "[ f : f6]d ) are not closed but open lines ",
    "the ridges of the @xmath0 distribution here approach very close to one another when making their turns but they never completely merge .",
    "we believe that this was also the case in the twisted configuration analyzed previously by @xcite with the help of the norm @xmath8 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "such a behavior of qsls in both cases has a simple explanation : due to a relatively large twist of the rope , there are field lines with a different number of windings ( larger than one ) in the neighborhood of the hyperbolic magnetic minima in the corona .",
    "a relative proximity of such field lines to these minima is translated into the apparent closeness of the respective @xmath82 lines at the photosphere due to an enormous squashing that the elemental flux tubes experience on their way from the minima to the photosphere . from the observational point of view",
    ", however , this seems to be a atypical situation , since the observed flaring bright loops rarely show multiple windings .",
    "therefore , the qsl footprints in realistic magnetic configurations should look like open rather than closed curves , as actually demonstrated by @xcite for a flux rope configuration with a realistic amount of twist .",
    "consider now the distributions of the slip - forth and slip - back squashing factors calculated numerically for the variation of @xmath130 in the interval @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "these calculations are significantly simplified due to the above - mentioned line - tying condition @xmath147 that implies the absence of plasma flows at the photosphere . as discussed in the previous section , the calculation of @xmath72 or @xmath77 in such a case requires knowledge only of @xmath148 at the initial and final moments , which can be obtained here from equations ( [ bx])([bz ] ) .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath72 and @xmath77 are shown in panels ( e ) and ( f ) , respectively , in figure [ f : f6 ] .",
    "the inner or outer pairs of the ridges of the @xmath72 distribution trace the instantaneous or future @xmath83 lines , respectively ; and vice versa : the outer or inner pairs of the ridges of the @xmath77 distribution trace the instantaneous or past @xmath83 lines , respectively . comparing panels ( e ) and ( f ) vs. ( c ) and",
    "( d ) in figure [ f : f6 ] shows that the instantaneous @xmath83 lines practically coincide with the instantaneous @xmath82 lines  exactly as previously inferred from the general consideration [ see equations ( [ sf_rffp_0 ] ) and ( [ sb_rffp_t ] ) ] .",
    "in contrast , the future and past @xmath83 lines are noticeably distorted in comparison with the corresponding @xmath82 lines , which is also in accord with the inferred general equations ( [ sf_rffp_ta1 ] ) and ( [ sb_rffp_0a1 ] ) . such a distortion is sufficiently smooth , that it causes the oval - like parts of the corresponding rf footprints to appear nearly as closed as their corresponding qsl footprints .",
    "it is useful also to consider the behavior of the @xmath83 lines in response to the variation of @xmath149 or @xmath150 for the slip - forth or slip - back mappings , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the footprints of the instantaneous @xmath83 lines remain practically unchanged under such a variation by recurring the shape of the corresponding @xmath82 lines shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ f : f6 ] . on the contrary , the future and past @xmath83 lines change their locations , shapes , and even topology .",
    "let @xmath151 be kept constant and @xmath149 be increasing in value from 8 to 13 .",
    "then the future @xmath83 line in each of the magnetic polarity will split and move outward from the respective instantaneous @xmath83 line by gradually increasing its length and bending itself in the middle part .",
    "in addition to these transformations , two small and very flat ovals emerge in the future @xmath83 lines by stretching themselves out from the conjugate footpoints of the field line that passes in the volume through the cusp minimum point .",
    "such ovals enclose the footprints of the initial flux tubes that will reconnect at the moment @xmath149 and form the above - mentioned flux rope ",
    "these flux tubes are shown in figure [ f : f7]d .",
    "the areas swept out by the major parts of the future @xmath83 lines determine the footprints of the flux tubes that will reconnect and form the  flare loops \" below the flux rope .",
    "one can see from figures [ f : f7]e and [ f : f7]f that , as expected , their conjugate footprints also include the magnetic flux that will belong to the flux rope . finally , the areas that are swept by the ovals in the exterior determine the footprints of the flux tubes that will pass through the flux rope formed during this evolution .",
    "let @xmath152 be kept constant and @xmath150 be decreasing in value from 13 to 8 .",
    "then the past @xmath83 line in each of the magnetic polarity will split and move inward from the respective instantaneous @xmath83 line by gradually decreasing its length and contracting the ovals that enclose the footprints of the flux rope ( see figure [ f : f7]g ) . at the moment",
    "@xmath151 , the ovals will completely shrink to the conjugate footpoints of the field line that passes in the volume through the cusp minimum point .",
    "the areas swept out by the major parts of the past @xmath83 lines determine the footprints of the reconnected flux tubes manifesting themselves as  flare loops \" formed below the flux rope [ panels ( h ) and ( i ) in figure [ f : f7 ] ] .",
    "this kind of flux tube may have been directly observed in x - rays as coronal loops slipping along their respective qsl footprints @xcite .",
    "finally , the areas that are swept by the ovals in the exterior determine the footprints of the flux tubes that have passed through the flux rope formed during this evolution .",
    "thus , this example clearly demonstrates that the slip - squashing factors allow one to identify reconnecting magnetic fluxes in a given magnetic evolution with an unprecedented level of detail .",
    "let us consider now an alternate magnetic evolution , where , in contrast to example 1 , the footprints of the initial and final qsls overlap each other .",
    "this causes the resulting rfs to behave in a less predictable way than before , and it also provides some new insights into the significance of the slip - squashing factors .    as the initial configuration , let us take the force - free magnetic field depending only on the @xmath153 coordinate as @xmath154 the corresponding magnetic field lines are straight and tilted toward the @xmath107-axis at the angle @xmath155 , which changes smoothly with @xmath153 from @xmath156 to @xmath157 to form a sheared structure .",
    "most of the magnetic shear , and its associated electric current density , @xmath158 are concentrated in a slab - like layer of half thickness @xmath159 .",
    "let this configuration be bounded from the top and bottom by ideally conducting plates located at @xmath160 .",
    "then using the straightness of the magnetic field lines and equations ( [ d])-([g ] ) , it is not difficult to calculate the respective squashing factor @xmath161 figure [ f : f8](a ) shows the profiles of @xmath0 at different @xmath157 and other fixed parameters by demonstrating that at sufficiently small @xmath159 and large @xmath157 our current layer becomes a qsl , in which both @xmath0 and current density increase together with the total shear angle @xmath162 . since @xmath163 everywhere in the configuration , the appearance of such a qsl is not related to the presence of any magnetic minima in contrast to example 1 . instead , this particular qsl is the result of a large magnetic shear present inside a thin layer with a strong current density .",
    "if the latter reaches a certain threshold value defined through other plasma parameters , a nonideal plasma effect may come into play .",
    "for example , the onset of some plasma instability might be triggered .",
    "this would , in turn , cause the appearance of an electric field with a nonvanishing component along @xmath164 inside the layer .",
    "one can assume also that in reality some of the plasma parameters may have nonuniform distributions and so the threshold conditions would be reached first at some spot in the layer .",
    "this would , in turn , lead to a localization of the parallel electric field in the spot .",
    "we can model such a process in our case by introducing into the configuration the following electric field @xmath165 the time and space variation of @xmath166 is described here by the time derivative of some function @xmath105 and the function @xmath167^{-1 } ,      \\label{f2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . taking the curl of @xmath166 and integrating it over time , we obtain in accord with faraday s law the resulting magnetic field @xmath168 this is , of course , a very approximate model of the respective real process , since @xmath166 is prescribed here in an ad hoc way rather than derived from the appropriate plasma dynamics . however , the model is accurate enough to qualitatively demonstrate the difference between magnetic reconnection and diffusion in a simple , but generic , case .",
    "the field - line equation does not admit an analytical solution for the derived magnetic field @xmath148 , so the corresponding squashing factors have been calculated numerically for the following set of parameters : @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 with integers @xmath174 .",
    "in all these cases , the assumed electric field is localized in a patch - like region that has the shape of a very flat ellipsoid compressed in the @xmath153 direction .",
    "figure [ f : f8](b ) shows an example of the @xmath0 distribution in the plane @xmath175 at @xmath176 , when the transverse gradients of the perturbed and unperturbed @xmath106 components of the magnetic field become comparable in value at the center of the patch .",
    "the respective @xmath0 distribution at the top plate @xmath177 is obtained from the one below by its mirror reflection about the @xmath106-axis .",
    "these distributions show that two well - pronounced qsls adjacent to one another eventually emerge inside the initial qsl .",
    "such an evolution of the qsls is very different from the one studied in example 1 .    by definition",
    ", @xmath0 is invariant to the direction of mapping along the field lines , so its footpoint value can be prescribed by any other point of the respective field line , thereby extending the boundary @xmath0 distribution into the volume .",
    "this allows one to study the 3d structure of the qsls via the distribution of @xmath0 at different cross sections .",
    "figure [ f : f8](c ) displays one such distribution in the plane @xmath108 at @xmath176 together with the respective set of contours of @xmath178 in this plane .",
    "one can see from this figure that the positions of local maxima of @xmath0 and minima of @xmath123 in the plane @xmath108 are relatively close to one another , although not identical .",
    "a noticeable shift between them is probably the result of the relative shallowness of the minima of @xmath123 , whose values are just 10% lower in comparison with the background , while the characteristic sizes of the minima are of the order of @xmath159 . in other words , the appearance of the new qsls seems to be related again to the formation of the minima of @xmath123 in the configuration , as was the case in example 1",
    "the only difference is that such a relation in example 1 is stronger because of a much larger depth of the corresponding minima .",
    "for the same set of parameters , figure [ f : f8](d ) shows the distribution of the pseudo - potential @xmath140 [ defined by equation ( [ xi ] ) ] in the plane @xmath175 , which suggests that a substantial change of magnetic connectivity must occur in our configuration along the diagonal of the computational rectangular area .",
    "this is confirmed by figure [ f : f8](e ) that presents the respective distribution of the slip - back squashing factor @xmath179 for the time period , where @xmath130 increases from 0 to 0.006 . since the assumed electric field drops exponentially with growing @xmath180 toward the boundary plates",
    "[ see equations ( [ e_sl])([f2 ] ) ] , the @xmath179 distribution is calculated here under the assumption that the line - tying condition is strictly fulfilled at the plates . in other words , a possible small footpoint advection is neglected in calculating the respective slip - back mapping , which is composed of the final and initial field - line mappings only , as described in section [ s : nonideal ] .",
    "the @xmath179 so obtained demonstrates that a major change of connectivity occurs along a narrow strip that is aligned with both the respective new qsl footprints and the area with large values of @xmath181 .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with the analysis of a similar nonideal evolution in the so - called x - line configuration @xcite .",
    "the indicated narrow strip can be identified here only with the footprint of the instantaneous rf , since the past rf is absent at the initial moment ( simply because the new qsls just start to emerge at that moment ) .    to see how this rf footprint evolves ,",
    "we determine it as the area at the boundary plate , where @xmath182 , for several pairs of @xmath130 , whose initial values equal 0 .",
    "this value is used same for all the pairs , while the final values vary within the interval @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "these rf footprints , represented in figure [ f : f8](f ) by gray shadings of different intensity , form a clearly nested structure such that the area that is swept out by the final time approaches asymptotically to the area of the instantaneous rf footprint at this time . in terms of the corresponding @xmath83 lines ,",
    "this means that they grow in length by remaining nearly self - aligned and not by moving in the transverse direction ( in contrast to example 1 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the reconnected flux tubes in situations like this , one should extend our previous definition of the reconnected boundary area by replacing the sweeping @xmath83 lines in this definition with the sweeping rf footprints .",
    "since both of them depend on the chosen value @xmath184 , such an extension does not increase the ambiguity in determining the reconnected magnetic fluxes .",
    "it does , however , make this definition more general .",
    "the reconnected flux tubes as defined above are shown in figure [ f : f9 ] with the help of the magnetic field lines that are launched from the contours @xmath185 at the boundary plates @xmath186 .",
    "these flux tubes intersect but do not coincide with one another , which is evident from the locations of the target footpoints being scattered partly outside of the rf footprint at the other boundary plate . nevertheless , such footpoints also outline a very elongated oval that is slightly turned with respect to the corresponding rf footprint around their common center @xmath187 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the characteristic plasma rotation in magnetic flux tubes passing through a nonideal region ",
    "an effect that was previously described in the framework of the gmr theory @xcite .",
    "our second example suggests that the characteristic feature that distinguishes reconnection from diffusion is rfs with narrow ribbon - like footprints .",
    "such footprints are characterized by two length scales , one of which is much smaller than the other .",
    "displacement of plasma elements in the nonideal region across the corresponding rfs causes a large change in magnetic connectivity along the rf footprints . in other words , the high values of slip - squashing factors at the flux tubes that pass through and in the vicinity of a nonideal region",
    "is the major signature of reconnection compared to diffusion .",
    "the transition from one process to the other is not abrupt but continuous both in time and in parameter space , and only in this sense it is just a matter of semantics of how one refers to this process ",
    "reconnection or diffusion .",
    "generally , the appearance of such nonideal regions in configurations is closely related to locally enhanced current density , which corresponds to large magnetic shear , large values of the squashing factor , and hence large values of the slip - squashing factors .",
    "because of this causal chain , it seems preferable to refer to the process in the nonideal regions as reconnection rather than magnetic diffusion .    note also that strong outflow jets of plasma from the nonideal regions have been a feature of traditional 2d reconnection models .",
    "we may conjecture that perhaps this is also a property of many 3d reconnection regimes , although perhaps some types of 3d reconnection do not possess rapid outflow jets [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "the accurate proof of such a conjecture must rely on a self - consistent analysis of the full system of mhd equations , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , some indications of its validity can be seen from our present consideration as well . in particular , equations ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ b_sl ] )",
    "show that the considered nonideal process causes an x - type perturbation of the transverse magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the lorentz force due to interaction of this perturbation with the initial strong current layer will tend to accelerate plasma out of the nonideal region and to produce outflow jets .",
    "thus , the thinner the current layer , the stronger the acceleration , which corresponds , in turn , to the narrower rfs developing in the configuration , as demonstrated in this section .",
    "determining qsls and rfs via computation of the corresponding squashing factors is conceptually simple but technically difficult .",
    "however , the particular examples of magnetic evolution considered in sections [ s : exmpl1 ] and [ s : exmpl2 ] strongly suggest that there is a close relationship between qsls , rfs , and magnetic minimum points",
    ". if the presence of such a minimum point is a sufficient condition for the existence of the respective qsl , this might significantly simplify determining qsls in a given configuration . finding magnetic minima is technically as simple as finding magnetic null points , so locating such minima",
    "would significantly facilitate the localization of qsls and rfs .",
    "this motivates us to study the local properties of magnetic minima in the most general terms .",
    "note first that , for any point with @xmath188 , the system of coordinates can always be chosen in such a way that @xmath189 , while @xmath190 . if the point is a magnetic minimum , then @xmath191 or simply @xmath192 in such a system of coordinates .",
    "taking also into account that @xmath193 , we obtain the following general expression for the matrix of gradients of magnetic field at its minimum point : @xmath194 = \\left (    \\begin{array}{crc }          \\partial_{x}b_{x } &           \\partial_{y}b_{x } &          \\partial_{z}b_{x }    \\\\ [ 3pt ]          \\partial_{x}b_{y } &          -\\partial_{x}b_{x } &          \\partial_{z}b_{y }    \\\\ [ 3pt ]          0 &   0 &   0          \\end{array } \\right ) \\equiv   \\left (    \\begin{array}{crc }          { a } &     \\tilde{b }     &   { c }    \\\\ [ 3pt ]          { b } &          -{a }     &   { d }    \\\\ [ 3pt ]           0   &            0      &    0          \\end{array } \\right ) .      \\label{bmm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rotating the system of coordinates about the @xmath107-axis does not change the components of @xmath148 at the minimum point , but it reduces @xmath195 at a certain rotation angle to the form @xmath196          b &   -a   &   d    \\\\ [ 3pt ]          0 &    0   &   0          \\end{array } \\right ) ,      \\label{bmmcan}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all matrix elements are generally different from those in equation ( [ bmm ] ) .",
    "thus , in this rotated system of coordinates , we obtain the canonical linearized form for a magnetic - minimum field @xmath197 using these expressions , one can easily find from equation ( [ fle ] ) the corresponding magnetic field lines . depending on the values of parameters @xmath198 and @xmath199",
    ", there are only three different types of minimum : hyperbolic , cusp , and elliptic minima , exactly as in the example considered in section [ s : exmpl1 ] . assuming that the field lines start in the plane @xmath108 , so that @xmath200 , we have for all these types of minimum @xmath201 which simply represents linear dependence of @xmath107 on the differential flux tube volume @xmath202 . for hyperbolic minima , which exist",
    "when @xmath203 , the field lines are given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 in the limit @xmath206 yielding @xmath207 , one can retrieve from here the field - line structure at cusp minima described by @xmath208 the same expressions can also be retrieved in the limit @xmath209 from the elliptic minima , which exist when @xmath210 with neighboring field lines determined by @xmath211 where @xmath212 the above analytical expressions show that the highest divergence of field lines in response to the variation of @xmath213 or @xmath214 is achieved in the vicinity of hyperbolic magnetic minima [ see equations ( [ xh ] ) and ( [ yh ] ) ] .",
    "the corresponding gradients of @xmath153 and @xmath106 with respect to @xmath213 or @xmath214 grow exponentially with @xmath107 , and the rate of this growth increases with decreasing @xmath215 . in the case of cusp minima , however , such a growth is only linear in @xmath107 , while for elliptic minima it is even saturated via the sine - function .",
    "this provides a strong general argument in favor of the idea that the hyperbolic and cusp minima of a magnetic field are responsible for the appearance of qsls and corresponding rfs in evolving magnetic configurations .",
    "although both of the examples considered in sections [ s : exmpl1 ] and [ s : exmpl2 ] possess some symmetry , we do not think that this is a crucial factor for the emergence of qsls and rfs .",
    "the really important parameters that control the thickness of the emerging qsls should be the depth of the respective hyperbolic magnetic minima and their characteristic sizes compared to the global length scale of the configuration . in this respect , the magnetic null points are just a degenerate case of magnetic minima , whose associated qsls are transformed into genuine separatrix surfaces .",
    "more detailed studies are certainly needed in the future to quantify the relation between qsls and magnetic minima .",
    "we have developed a general theory for the evolution of magnetic connections between boundary plasma elements in an arbitrary 3d magnetic configuration with an arbitrarily shaped boundary .",
    "the theory assumes that at each instant the magnetic field is known everywhere throughout the volume domain including the boundary , where the tangential flow of plasma elements is also known .    the major quantity that is used for characterizing the magnetic connectivity and its evolution is the squashing factor @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "after being applied to the magnetic field - line mapping , the @xmath0 factor allows one to identify in a given configuration all separatrix and quasi - separatrix surfaces , as well as their hybrids .",
    "we have demonstrated first how the @xmath0 factor is determined for any ideal evolution of the magnetic configuration in terms of the initial magnetic field and tangential boundary flows without reference to the magnetic field at other moments in time .",
    "this result is itself of great importance for the further development of the theory of current - layer formations in magnetic configurations with a highly conducting plasma via its motion at the boundary .    in order to describe the nonideal evolution of magnetic connectivity , we have introduced the so - called  slip mapping \" , which characterizes the change of magnetic connections between the boundary plasma elements due to violation of the frozen - in law in the plasma volume .",
    "this mapping can be defined either forward or backward in time to give correspondingly slip - forth or slip - back mappings , which operate on the initial or final configurations , respectively , within a chosen time interval . by calculating the squashing factor for these new mappings ,",
    "we have defined new quantities called slip - forth and slip - back squashing factors , @xmath72 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the large values of these quantities identify the reconnecting magnetic flux tubes , called reconnection fronts ( rfs ) , at the initial and final time instances .",
    "the boundary areas that are swept by rfs within a chosen time interval correspond to the footprints of reconnecting magnetic flux tubes . in this way",
    ", the @xmath72 factor determines in the initial configuration the to - be - reconnected magnetic flux tubes , while the @xmath77 factor determines in the final configuration the reconnected magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the dependence of the properties of the rfs on tangential boundary flows is also analyzed .",
    "the general results are illustrated with two specific examples based on evolving magnetic configurations .",
    "the first of these was considered earlier by @xcite in the framework of the general magnetic reconnection ( gmr ) theory @xcite .",
    "revisiting this example , we have demonstrated that our approach is consistent with gmr theory but complements it in several important aspects .",
    "the second example describes a magnetic evolution that is driven by a thin current layer with a field - line voltage drop at a small patch inside it .",
    "this example enables us to show that the localization of such a nonideal process in a small region may indeed cause the structural changes that are characteristic for reconnection rather than for magnetic diffusion .",
    "the latter example , in particular , demonstrates the formation of magnetic flux tubes with narrow , ribbon - like footprints , which is a typical feature of reconnection process .",
    "in comparison with gmr theory , our approach handles regions with small or large amounts of reconnected flux on an equal footing .",
    "this is because the slip - squashing factors , in contrast to the voltage drop of gmr , are dimensionless geometrical quantities measuring only a relative spatial rate of magnetic slippage at the boundary . for the same reason",
    ", the slip - squashing factors discriminate between regions of reconnection and simple diffusion much better than the voltage drop method .",
    "moreover , since the slip mappings are composed from the field - line mappings and both types of mappings are characterized by the same quantity , the analysis of reconnection based on our theory is intimately related to the analysis of magnetic structure . as we have demonstrated here , the latter provides intriguing opportunities for analyzing magnetic reconnection in 3d configurations with an unprecedented level of detail .",
    "the use of slip - squashing factors opens new perspectives for the comparing reconnecting flux tubes predicted by the theoretical models with the different morphological features observed in the solar flares and coronal mass ejections [ e.g. brightening coronal loops , chromospheric kernels and ribbons , see the recent review by @xcite ] .",
    "our analysis of these examples also reveals the special role of hyperbolic and cusp minimum points in 3d magnetic field configurations .",
    "the elemental magnetic flux tubes passing in the vicinity of such points may become extremely squashed , which implies the formation of the respective qsls .",
    "we have extended these examples by studying the field - line structure in the neighborhood of generic magnetic minima and confirmed this particular result .    hence , similar to magnetic null points ,",
    "hyperbolic and cusp minima provide an important localization of plausible reconnection sites .",
    "more detailed investigations in this direction promise to lead to even more interesting results .",
    "it should be emphasized that , similar to gmr theory , our approach is applicable to the analysis of reconnection in magnetic configurations described not only by mhd , but also by any other plasma model .",
    "the algorithm of calculating slip - squashing factors admits a straightforward implementation and it is highly parallelizable .",
    "our experience shows that , even without parallelization , the squashing factor may be computed for known magnetic field data with a modest demand on computing resources .",
    "thus , the whole approach is practical enough to pursue the implementation of the proposed algorithms for calculating slip - squashing factors for the solar corona .",
    "the solar physics group at saic is presently working on this project .",
