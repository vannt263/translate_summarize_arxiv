    "blazars dominate the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky @xcite , exhibiting flares in which the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray flux is seen to increase up to several times the pre - flare level ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because the emitting regions are unresolved , the location of the gev emission remains unknown and this constitutes an open issue in understanding energy dissipation in blazars .    in the leptonic model ,",
    "the gev emission of blazars is produced by ic scattering of photons off of the same relativistic electrons in the jet that give rise to synchrotron radiation ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the seed photons for ic scattering are synchrotron photons originating within the relativistic jet ( synchrotron - self compton , ssc scattering ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or photons originating external to the jet ( external compton , ec scattering ) , such as uv accretion disk photons @xcite , uv photons originating from the blr @xcite , and ir photons originating from molecular torus ( mt ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because the @xmath1-ray emission of blazars can vary significantly on short times , down to the instrument limits , ranging from a few minutes ( in the tev range ) @xcite to a few hours ( in the gev range ) @xcite , light - time travel arguments constrain the size of the emitting region and it has been argued ( e.g. *",
    "* ) that this requires the emission to take place at the sub - pc scale .",
    "explaining the _ fermi _ gev spectral breaks seen in powerful blazars @xcite as a result of pair absorption on the he lyman recombination continuum and lines , produced in the inner part of the blr , places the gev emission well within the blr @xcite .",
    "very short distances @xmath2 cm ) , however , where accretion disk photons dominate are not favored , because of the high pair production @xmath0-ray opacity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "gamma - ray flares have been associated with radio and optical flares , placing the gev emission outside the blr : @xcite , using the temporal separation of the radio and @xmath0-ray fluxes , argued that the @xmath0-ray emission site is at a distance of @xmath3 pc from the central engine .",
    "connections have been also drawn between @xmath0-ray outbursts , optical flare polarization changes , and ejections of superluminal radio knots on the pc scale : @xcite associated short @xmath0-ray variations with the passage of disturbances from the radio core , parsecs away from the black hole . in the case of oj 287 , @xcite found @xmath1-ray flaring to be simultaneous with mm outbursts associated with a vlba jet component 14 pc downstream from the radio core .",
    "here we propose a method to distinguish if the gev emission of powerful blazars takes place within the sub - pc blr or further out within the pc - scale mt . in ",
    "[ cooling ] we discuss our understanding of the blr , mt , and ssc photon fields and where each one dominates .",
    "we show that cooling on the uv blr photons results in achromatic cooling times in the _ fermi _ band , while cooling on the mt ir photons results to faster cooling times at higher @xmath0-ray energies . in  [ diagnostic ] we present our method , discussing the dilution of an energy - dependent cooling time from light travel time effects and discuss the applicability of our method .",

    "because of this scaling , and assuming that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the blr covering factor , the energy density inside the blr ( @xmath10 ) is not expected to vary widely from object to object @xcite . as was shown by @xcite , when transformed to the jet frame , the blr spectrum , dominated by @xmath11 ly@xmath12 photons , is broadened and boosted in luminosity due to relativistic effects and can be well - approximated by a blackbody spectrum that peaks at @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath16 is the photon energy in mc@xmath17 units .    in the mt the dust temperature ranges from @xmath18",
    "k @xcite ( to @xmath19 k @xcite , with hotter emitting material expected to be closer to the central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because of the larger size of the mt , it has been probed by reverberation mapping only for seyfert galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which have lower luminosities and therefore smaller mt sizes .",
    "these studies , along with near - ir interferometric studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also support an @xmath20 scaling , suggesting that @xmath21 is similar for sources of different luminosities . adopting the scaling of @xcite , @xmath22 cm and assuming a covering factor @xmath23 , the mt photon energy density is @xmath24 erg @xmath25 .",
    "we also adopt a temperature @xmath26 , corresponding to a blackbody peak at @xmath27 hz ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "for an isotropic photon field , the co - moving ( jet frame ) energy density @xmath29 is @xmath30 , while for photons entering the emitting region from behind , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if the emission site is located at @xmath32 , the blr photon field can be considered isotropic in the galaxy frame and , using the blr energy density discussed in ",
    "[ sec : characterizing ] , @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , the mt photon field is isotropic inside the blr and its co - moving seed photon energy density is @xmath34 erg @xmath25 .",

    "if the emission site is located at @xmath39 , then the blr photons enter the emitting region practically from behind , so that @xmath40 erg @xmath25 .",
    "the mt photons retain the same co - moving energy density as before and , in this case , the mt dominates the co - moving photon energy density .    these external photon field",
    "co - moving energy densities need to be compared to the synchrotron one .",
    "if @xmath41 is the size of the emitting region , then the co - moving synchrotron photon energy density is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the usual doppler factor and @xmath44 the synchrotron luminosity .",
    "an upper limit to @xmath41 is set by the variability timescale @xmath45 : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the source redshift .",
    "we then obtain a lower limit @xmath48 or @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the variability time in days . setting @xmath51 the condition @xmath52 requires @xmath53    this translates to @xmath54 for the emission site at @xmath55 scales and @xmath56 for the emission site at @xmath57 scales . in general ,",
    "powerful quasars exhibit superluminal motions requiring @xmath58 @xcite and therefore , the dominant source of seed photons for these sources should be the blr or the mt , provided the @xmath0-ray emission site is at a distance not significantly larger than the size of the mt .",
    "a recent finding by @xcite that the ratio of @xmath0-ray to synchrotron luminosity increases with increasing radio core , as expected for ec emission @xcite , supports further the possibility that powerful blazars are ec emitters .      _ the critical difference between the blr and the mt is the energy of the seed photons : the blr produces uv photons while the mt produces ir photons .",
    "this difference by a factor of @xmath38 in typical photon energy is critical in that it affects the energy regime in which the gev - emitting electron ic - cooling takes place , and thus the energy dependence of the electron cooling time . _    for this consideration to be relevant , ic cooling must dominate over synchrotron cooling .",
    "this condition is satisfied , since in powerful blazars the ic luminosity clearly dominates over the synchrotron luminosity , reaching in high states an ic luminosity higher that the synchrotron one by a factor of up to @xmath59 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for electrons cooling in the thomson regime ( @xmath60 , where both the electron lorentz factor @xmath0 and the seed photon energy @xmath61 are measured in the same frame ) the cooling rate @xmath62 . for electrons with @xmath63",
    "cooling takes place in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime with @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "for the broad intermediate regime , @xmath65 , a parametric approximation has been suggested @xcite . in what follows",
    "we calculate numerically the electron energy loss rate @xmath66 , which for monoenergetic seed photons of number density @xmath67 and dimensionless energy @xmath61 is    @xmath68    where , following @xcite , @xmath69 with @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "the effects of the transition between thomson and kn regimes on the electron energy distribution ( eed ) and the resultant spectrum of the synchrotron and ic emission have been studied before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in short , the transition from thomson to kn cooling in the eed can be seen for the steady state @xmath71 : for a power law injection @xmath72 , the cooled eed hardens from @xmath73 in the thomson regime to @xmath74 in the kn regime .",
    "the transition takes place gradually at @xmath75 .",
    "a second transition back to @xmath73 is expected at higher @xmath0 , as synchrotron losses ( assumed to be less significant than thomson ec losses ) become larger than kn losses .",
    "the imprint of these considerations on the observed synchrotron and ic spectra has been considered for the case of the x - ray emission of large scale jets @xcite and in the case of blazars @xcite .",
    "spectral signatures , however , are not unique and can be diluted or altered by extraneous causes ( e.g. the accelerated electron distribution has intrinsic features that deviate from a power law , the synchrotron emission is contaminated by the big blue bump , the ic emission is modified by pair production absorption from synchrotron or external photons ) .",
    "for these reasons their use in understanding where the gev emission takes place is problematic .",
    "there is however another observable aspect of the thomson - kn transition that is free of the issues faced by relying on spectral signatures : _ the energy dependence of the electron cooling time can be used to evaluate the regime at which the electrons that produce the gev radiation cool , and through this evaluate where the emission takes place .",
    "_    in the thomson regime , the electron cooling time @xmath76 scales as @xmath77 , while in the kn regime the electron cooling time scales as as @xmath78 .",
    "these two regimes connect smoothly forming a wide _ valley _ around @xmath79 in which the cooling time is practically energy - independent .",
    "the energy of the seed photons originating in the blr is greater than that of photons from the mt by a factor of @xmath38 . as a result , ( see fig . [",
    "fig : blrmt ] ) the location of the energy - independent valley of the blr case is manifested at electron energies lower by a factor of @xmath38 than that of the mt case . in turn",
    ", the energy dependence of @xmath80 causes a related energy dependence in the observed falling time @xmath81 of the flare .",
    "the falling time @xmath81 of _ fermi _ light curves can be used , therefore , to determine whether a flare occurs within the blr or within the mt .",
    "we utilize an one - zone code to demonstrate the effect of a flare occurring within the blr versus a flare occurring within the mt .",
    "the code assumes the injection of a power law electron distribution and follows its evolution taking into account the kn cross section , ssc losses , and assuming a black body external photon field .",
    "the implicit numerical scheme is similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after the code reaches a steady - state , an increase in the injection rate is introduced that lasts for a short time before it returns to its initial value .",
    "the code was initialized to simulate the flare occurring within the blr and the mt respective , described by the values discussed in  [ cooling ] .",
    "we assumed a compton dominance @xmath82 , source size @xmath83 , bulk lorentz factor @xmath84 .",
    "deep in the thomson regime ( mt case ) the compton dominance corresponds to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the external energy density and @xmath87 is the magnetic energy density .",
    "however , as cooling transitions from the thomson to the kn regime ( blr case ) , the ratio @xmath88 over - estimates the observed compton dominance by a factor of @xmath89    in the blr case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epscool ] , blue curve ) ic cooling occurs at the onset on the kn regime , resulting in a near - flattening of @xmath81 within the _ fermi _ band , where a change in energy by a factor of 100 ( from 200 mev to 20 gev ) results in a change in cooling time of less than an hour , with all the _ fermi _ energies having practically indistinguishable decay times ( between @xmath90 hours ) . in the mt case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epscool ] , red curve ) cooling occurs mostly in the thomson regime and @xmath81 is heavily energy - dependent ; the same change in energy by a factor of 100 results in a change in cooling time by @xmath91 hours .",
    "this is also apparent in the light curves shown in fig [ fig : flarelc ] .",
    "a flare occurring within the blr ( fig [ fig : flarelc ] , top panel ) has comparable values of @xmath92 within the _ fermi _ energy range .",
    "a flare occurring within the mt exhibits distinct falling times that decrease with observing energy ( [ fig : flarelc ] , lower panel ) .    _ for sufficiently bright flares with short decay times ( comparable to the cooling times of few to several hours anticipated ) , _ fermi _ light curves can be generated at multiple energies , and the energy dependence ( or lack thereof ) of @xmath92 can be used to reveal the location of the gev emitting site . _      because the gev emitting region is not a point source , the observed @xmath93 decay time @xmath94 of the light curve is a convolution of @xmath81 and the blob light - crossing time @xmath95 .",
    "any other variations ( e.g. a gradual decrease of the electron density ) will have a similar effect .",
    "for blr achromatic cooling , we expect the light curves to remain achromatic after considering light crossing time effects . to see the effects of @xmath95 in the case of mt cooling , where , @xmath96 , we consider a source with exponentially decaying emission coefficient , @xmath97 , and calculate the expected light curves for two energies differing by 10 and for a range of @xmath95 . as can be seen in fig [ fig : lctime ] , although @xmath94 increases with increasing @xmath95 , the difference of @xmath94 between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is practically preserved for all @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , because for given @xmath98 and @xmath99 the ratio of @xmath81 is also given , observations of the @xmath93 decay times for @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be used to find both @xmath95 and @xmath81 for each energy .",
    "[ fig : lctime ]      very bright flares , such as the november 2010 flare of 3c 454.3 @xcite have enough photon statistics to produce light curves in two _ fermi _ energy bands .",
    "the practical application of our diagnostic requires that the decay times in different energy bands have statistically meaningful differences if the flare occurs within the mt .",
    "to evaluate if this is the case for a flare as bright as that of 3c 454.3 , we adopted the maximum observed errors in the @xmath100 gev range and @xmath101 gev range @xcite and produced simulated data assuming energy - dependent cooling in the form of exponentially decaying light curves .",
    "we fitted an exponential decay function to the simulated data for each energy band , with the characteristic decay time as a free parameter .",
    "the decay times we recovered were statistically distinguishable , suggesting that our diagnostic is applicable , at least for the brightest flares observed .",
    "for flares from which no statistically significant difference in the decay time can be established , constraints can still be imposed on the location of the _ fermi _ detected emission by considering @xmath102 , the maximum decay time difference allowed by the data , between a high energy @xmath99 and a low energy @xmath98 .",

    "[ sec : characterizing ] and for @xmath107 corresponding to 100 mev and 1 gev , @xmath108 .",
    "the lorentz factor can be estimated from vlbi studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the mt luminosity can be taken to be a fraction @xmath109 of the accretion disk luminosity or in some cases can be directly measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we presented a diagnostic test for determining if the gev emission in powerfull blazars originates from within or outside the blr .",
    "our method utilizes the fact that if electrons cool via ic scattering on blr photons , cooling occurs at the onset of the kn regime and the resulting cooling times ( and thus light curves ) should be achromatic . if cooling occurs via ic scattering of less energetic mt photons , the electron cooling times , and thus light - curves , should exhibit significant energy - dependence and decrease as photon energy increases . the energy dependence of the cooling time difference perseveres in the presence of energy independent timescales such as the light crossing time .",
    "the method is applicable for the brightest _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray flares , and can provide upper limits on the flare location even when the decay times in different energies are statistically indistinguishable ."
