    "the study of spin glasses on locally tree - like lattices , with finite coordination number , has attracted a large interest in statistical physics since the eighties .    at the beginning of the past decade ,",
    "mzard and parisi @xcite adapted the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb)@xcite scheme to solve models on such sparse lattices , improving the bethe - peierls method in the cavity method .",
    "the cavity method enabled a large theoretical activity about such class of models in the past decade and important progress has been achieved .",
    "this theoretical activity was mainly concentrated on the zero - temperature limit @xcite of various constrained models on random graphs , because of the connection between such problems of statistical mechanics with this hard combinatorial optimization problems @xcite such as the k - satisfiability problem @xcite or the graphs coloring @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the rich literature about discrete spins ( potts or ising ) models , few results have been achieved with vector spin glass models .    in this paper we study a model of classical heisenberg spins with an unconventional non - random interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2=\\sum_{\\braket{ik}_g}j \\big({\\mathbf{s}}_i\\cdot { \\mathbf{s}}_k\\big)^2\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a positive coupling constant and the sum is over all edges of a given graph @xmath4 .",
    "the spins @xmath5 are @xmath0-dimensional vectors , lying on the unit sphere : @xmath6    at zero temperature , two interacting spins tend to orientate orthogonally to each other , so we call this model orthogonally constrained heisenberg model ( ochm ) . a satisfiability version of the problem , called orthogonal vector coloring , was studied in mathematics by haynes , gerald , et al .",
    "@xcite for generic graphs .",
    "the case when the graph @xmath4 is a finite dimensional periodic lattice was extensively investigated via numerical simulations @xcite . for generic non - periodic graphs @xmath4 , the model may show a completely different physical behavior .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the model over a simple graph belonging to the random regular graph ensemble @xmath7 : this ensemble consists of the set of all graphs the graph with n - vertices , such that the number of links connected to each vertex is equal to @xmath8 @xcite . in spin glass literature , such ensemble of random graphs",
    "is considered as a possible definition of bethe lattices @xcite .    because edges are random , for large @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the typical size of a loop is of order @xmath11 , so the probability to have finite loops vanishes in the @xmath12 limit",
    ". as consequence , random regular graphs ( rrg ) are locally isomorphic to a tree : such models are exactly solvable in mean field theory .",
    "because the coordination number is constant for each vertex , at finite length scale rrg do not show any disorder .",
    "the random nature of rrg enters at the global level because of the presence of large loops .",
    "large loops can induce frustration , and the model actually behaves as a mean - field spin glass .    for @xmath13 , unlike the ising spin glass model defined on the same ensemble of graphs@xcite , the condition of minimum energy for each couple of first neighbor spins is infinitely degenerate ( fig.[sphere ] ) .",
    "this feature , together with the non - randomness of coupling constants , makes this model quite similar to well - known anti - ferromagnetic @xmath0-states potts model ( af @xmath0-pm ) defined on rrg , where a degeneracy in single pair interaction also occurs @xcite",
    ". we can consider af @xmath0-pm as a discrete version of @xmath0-components ochm where spins are quenched in @xmath0 orthogonal fixed possible directions : each direction corresponds to a potts state .    from this analogy",
    ", we can argue that , if the af @xmath0-pm on a given graph is not frustrated , i.e. the graph is @xmath0-colorable @xcite , the ochm on the same graph is not frustrated too @xcite .",
    "whilst , in ising spin glasses , a competition between random ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic like interactions is necessary for the formation of a spin glass phase @xcite , in the presented model , as in af @xmath0-pm defined in the same graphs , the interaction is non - random and every edge has locally the same environment .",
    "for this reason , ochm and af @xmath0-pm constitute a different class of spin glasses , where the possibility to get a spin glass phase arises from the degeneracy of two spins minimum interaction energy level , that allow the system to form a self - generated disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ 2 ] we obtain a single vertex free energy functional using the replica formalism and then in section [ 3 ] we obtain , from variational principle , the mean field self - consistency equation for a proper order parameter ; in section [ 3 ] we also compute the stability operator ( hessian ) for a general solution of the mean field equation ; in section [ 4 ] we compute analytically the free energy for the rotational invariant ( paramagnetic ) phase and then we perform the study of the stability of such solution , and analyze the results .",
    "in this section we formulate the problem in a variational way : we define a variational effective free energy functional depending on a suitable order parameter .    for each given graph @xmath4",

    ", it is possible to choose boundary conditions such that the distribution of the spinsorientations , through the graph , is periodic ( crystal phase @xcite ) .",
    "however , in @xmath78 , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , such kind of solutions are incompatible with the presence of frustrated loops , so the modulation instability is prevented and the gibbs state is still extremal .",
    "the appearance of such instability is an artifact of the @xmath207 approach .",
    "the bp approach turns to be exact only for cayley tree , and its validity can be extended to generic sparse graphs only under some conditions .",
    "by contrast , the method proposed in this paper works directly with multigraph , and the presence of frustrating loops is explicitly encoded in the variational free energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the modulation instability is automatically suppressed , indeed the hessian is positive - definite at @xmath206 .",
    "obviously , the extremal solution of the rs saddle - point equation and the bp fixed - point are equivalent .",
    "the difference arises when we consider deviations around such saddle - point / fixed - point .",

    "the solution previously described , arising in cayley tree at @xmath206 , is avoided in rrg , so this phase must describe another kind of anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "we guess that , in this phase , each state is characterized by @xmath0 privileged orthogonal axes . because the presence of loops , the averaged single spin probability distribution @xmath125 must be symmetric under permutation of such axes , but is not uniform through the whole unit sphere , since the @xmath137 symmetry breaking , and has equivalent maxima along the privileged axes ( fig .",
    "[ figsfe ] ) .    in the paramagnetic phase",
    ", each spin is correlated only to its nearest neighbors , so it can rearrange paying a little energy coast . for this reason , each spin can spread uniformly through the unit sphere . in this anti - ferromagnetic phase , long - range correlations are present , since the high number of constraint due to the first neighbor interactions .",

    "symmetry breaking theories , all the anti - ferromagnetic solutions of this kind are equivalent under a proper rotation of the reference frame .",
    "note that the lower connectivity with a non zero @xmath155 is @xmath212 , that remarkably coincides with the rigorous upper bound limit to the paramagnetic extremality condition of @xcite for af @xmath0-pm , rederived in@xcite from the divergence of the spin glass susceptibility .    for @xmath180 ,",
    "the @xmath156 line and @xmath155 line cross at @xmath213 , so the system has a p - sg instability for larger connectivities ; the two lines also cross for @xmath177 , around @xmath214 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig2 ] ) .",
    "because of the high value of the connectivity , we suppose that , at @xmath177 , such cross is more likely to be prevented by the appearance of a first - order transition at a lower connectivity .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath180 , we guess that the instability line corresponds to a proper continuous p - sg transition at @xmath215 .",
    "since the replica symmetry breaking , the system can no longer verify the condition , i.e. it can not relax into a phase where the distributions of the spin s orientation in each site are the same , as in the anti - ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases .",
    "by analogy with others spin glass models , this phase should be dominated by the presence of a large number of equivalence classes of states , each of which described by a set of @xmath9 different single spin random correlated distributions , corresponding to each site of the graph .",
    "since the system shows a discontinuous changing in the character of the instability at high connectivities , the thermodynamic behavior at low connectivities ( near @xmath198 ) can not be grabbed by an expansion around the @xmath216 limit , as performed in @xcite for ising spin glass .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath156 and @xmath155 for large @xmath8 ( @xmath217 ) is derived , for a generic value of @xmath0 , performing the power expansion in @xmath218 of the eigenvalues and , up to the fourth order , and than reverting the two expansion according respectively to the equations and .we obtain : @xmath219 @xmath220 from this expansion we observe that the two _ critical _ lines never cross for @xmath221 , so we have a p - af instability for all value of @xmath8 , so the instability pattern changes considerably from @xmath222 to higher number of components .",
    "no big qualitative differences appear varying the number of spin s components for @xmath223 .",
    "we remark that , in order to achieve a complete description of the replica symmetric phase , the anti - ferromagnetic solution must be computed .",
    "this problem may be tackled via the low - temperature expansion of the equation and will be investigated in next works .",
    "in this paper we study a model of @xmath0-components vector spins , lying on the vertices of a rrg , with first neighbor interactions @xmath224 .",
    "this model could be considered as a continuum version of potts anti - ferromagnetic model .",
    "the average over rrg ensemble is performed , via the replica trick , using a new variational approach , presented in this paper for the first time .",
    "such method offers a simpler way to study the linear stability of replica symmetric solution , than other methods commonly used on sparse graphs .",
    "the paramagnetic free energy is computed and the linear stability analysis is performed , studying the positivity of the second variation of the variational free energy around the paramagnetic saddle point .",
    "we obtain the instability line on the connectivity - temperature plane .    at low connectivity ,",
    "the paramagnetic solution is stable also at zero temperature , up to a lower critical connectivity @xmath225 , where the system undergoes a continuous instability toward another replica symmetric solution that breaks the @xmath137 symmetry ( anti - ferromagnetic solution ) .",
    "the instability line assures the presence of a phase transition .",
    "however , as we stressed , we can not exclude the presence of a first - order phase transition : a non local analysis of the stability of the paramagnetic solution for this model is needed .",
    "this is a formidable task , also via a numerical approach .    comparing this model with the anti - ferromagnetic @xmath0-states potts model",
    ", we argued that the instability line should describe the proper phase diagram for @xmath180 at all connectivities , and also for @xmath226 near @xmath198 .",
    "the possibility that the system undergoes a discontinuous transition should be explored .",
    "we remark that , in order to achieve a complete description of the replica symmetric phase , the anti - ferromagnetic solution must be computed .",
    "it is also noted that the instability lines , for spins with @xmath173 and @xmath174 components , is completely different from what obtained for higher numbers of components . in these two cases ,",
    "the paramagnetic phase manifests an instability with respect to replica symmetry breaking at high connectivities .",
    "the results , described in this paper , lay the necessary groundwork for next studies about finite connectivity heisenberg glass models .",
    "we stress that the variational method , proposed in this paper , could be easily extended to many other systems with a finite connectivity and may represent a valid alternative to the cavity method .",
