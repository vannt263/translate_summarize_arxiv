    "recently studies have identified a family of multiferroics which display a phase transition in which there simultaneously develops long - range incommensurate magnetic and uniform ferroelectric order . perhaps the most detailed studies have been carried out on the systems ni@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( nvo)@xcite and tbmno@xmath0 ( tmo).@xcite ( for a review , see ref . .",
    ") this phenomenon has been explained@xcite on the basis of a phenomenological model which invokes a landau expansion in terms of the order parameters describing the incommensurate magnetic order and the order parameter describing the uniform spontaneous polarization . already from this treatment it was clear that a microscopic model would have to involve a trilinear interaction hamiltonian proportional to the product of two spin variables and one displacement variable .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry requirements of the phenomenological model would naturally be realized by a proper microscopic model .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we present a detailed combined neutron scattering study and first - principles calculations of the optical phonons of nvo and thereby identify those having the right symmetry to induce a dipole moment .",
    "we also consider the expansion of the exchange tensor to first order in the generalized displacement coordinates .",
    "the aim of this programme is to determine which of the generalized displacements are relevant and which corresponding elements of the exchange tensor are needed for this microscopic calculation .",
    "this paper will therefore set the stage for a separate quantum calculation of the exchange tensor and its derivatives with respect to atomic displacements . on general grounds , one might expect the dzyaloshinskii - moriya@xcite ( dm ) interaction to play an important role in this calculation,@xcite and indeed , we will find this to be the case .",
    "however , the conclusion is a bit more subtle , in that displacement derivatives of many elements of the exchange tensor ( and not just the antisymmetric one of the dm interaction ) are needed for the microscopic calculation .",
    "we will show that simplistic models are somewhat misleading in that they may lead one to believe that the only exchange tensor elements whose derivatives are important are the dm ones .",
    "although our calculations may seem complicated , they are essential if one wishes to actually relate the magnetoelectric coupling to detailed quantum calculations ( via lda@xcite or lda@xmath3@xcite schemes ) of the strain - dependence of the exchange tensors . the methodology of the present paper can be extended in a straightforward way to tmo , for instance .",
    "briefly this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an overview of the calculation . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the first - principles calculations of the zone - center phonons and identify those phonons which transform like a vector and which are thus candidates to produce a spontaneous polarization . in this section",
    "we also present the neutron scattering measurements of the phonon density of states ( dos ) , which is found to be in good agreement with the calculated spectrum .",
    "next in sec .",
    "iv we summarize the results of the determination of the spin structure.@xcite in sec .",
    "v we then use the symmetry operations of the crystal to show how the phonon derivatives of the various exchange tensors in the unit cell are related to one another . then in sec .",
    "vi we show that a mean - field treatment of this spin - phonon coupling leads to the results obtained previously@xcite in a phenomenological model . here",
    "we give expressions for the spontaneous polarization in terms of graidents of the excahnge tensor whose evaluation remains to be done .",

    "we now describe the sets of crystallographically equivalent sites which the various atoms occupy .",
    "( such a set of crystallographically equivalent sites is called a _",
    "wyckoff orbit_. ) there are six such orbits as shown in table  [ orbit ] .",
    "the first two are those of the ni atoms , the first consisting of the two ni(1 ) ( a ) sites ( which we call `` cross - tie '' sites ) and the second consisting of the four ni(2 ) ( e ) sites ( which we call `` spine '' sites ) .",
    "the four v ( f ) sites comprise the third orbit and the oxygen sites are distributed into two ( f ) orbits , one containing four o(1 ) atoms , the other containing four o(2 ) atoms , and a ( g ) orbit containing eight o(3 ) atoms .",
    "( the letters a , e , f , g classify the site symmetry according to the convention of ref . . the number of sites in the orbit as listed in ref",
    "is twice what we give here because here we consider the primitive unit cell rather than the conventional unit cell . )",
    "the locations of these sites are specified in the second column of table [ orbit ] .",
    "note that there are two formula units of nvo per unit cell .",
    "the ni sites form buckled planes which resemble a kagom lattice and two such adjacent planes are shown in fig . 1 where the buckling is omitted for simplicity .",
    "there one sees that the ni spine sites form chains along the @xmath6-direction between which the ni cross - tie sites are situated , with bonds to nearest - neighboring spine sites which form a cross tie . to illustrate the use of table [ orbit ] we find that the eight operations of table [ puc ] acting on @xmath7 generate four copies of each of the 2 a sites which are at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "similarly one can generate the eight g sites by applying in turn the eight operations of table [ puc ] to the site at @xmath4 .",

    "these lti variables are here denoted @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 to describe the orientation of the spine spins and @xmath28 to describe the orientation of the cross tie spins . because the crystal is centrosymmetric , it is shown@xcite that within a given representation all these complex structural parameters ( the @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s ) can be written in terms of a real amplitude times a complex phase factor which is the same for all variables of the same irrep , @xmath18 or @xmath24 , in the sense that @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes either spine or cross - tie .",

    "<S> we develop a microscopic magnetoelectric coupling in ni@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( nvo ) which gives rise to the trilinear phenomenological coupling used previously to explain the phase transition in which magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters appear simultaneously . using combined neutron scattering measurements and first - principles calculations of the phonons in nvo , </S>",
    "<S> we determine eleven phonons which can induce the observed spontaneous polarization . among these eleven phonons </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a few of them can actually induce a significant dipole moment . using the calculated atomic charges , we find that the required distortion to induce the observed dipole moment is very small (  0.001  ) and therefore it would be very difficult to observe the distortion by neutron - powder diffraction . finally , we identify the derivatives of the exchange tensor with respect to atomic displacements which are needed for a microscopic model of a spin - phonon coupling in nvo and which we hope will be obtained from a fundamental quantum calculation such as lda+u . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze two toy models to illustrate that the dzyaloskinskii - moriya interaction is very important for coexisting of magnetic and ferroelectric order but it is not the only mechanism when the local site symmetry of the system is low enough . </S>"
