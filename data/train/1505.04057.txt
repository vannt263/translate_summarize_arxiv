    "+ 0 cm                polymer translocation through a nanopore , which has rapidly emerged as one of the most active research areas in biological and soft matter physics , plays an important role in many biological processes such as rna transport through a nuclear membrane pore and @xmath2-hemolysin channels @xcite , virus injection into cells and transportation of protein through membrane channels @xcite .",
    "it also has many technological applications such as rapid dna sequencing @xcite , drug delivery @xcite and gene therapy , and has been motivation for many theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "so far most of the theoretical studies have been focused on the case of pore - driven translocation of a polymer chain through a nanopore with a constant radius and by a constant driving force , which is inherently a far - from - equilibrium phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "however , some theoretical and experimental work has also been done where the width of the pore changes during the translocation process .",
    "for example , the active translocation of a polymer chain through a flickering pore has been investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations to show that translocation through the pore with an alternating width and sticky walls exhibits more efficient translocation as compared to the static pore @xcite .",
    "there are some biological examples of this such as the nuclear pore complex , which plays an important role in nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotes @xcite .",
    "another example is the exchange of molecules between mitochondria and the rest of cell which is controlled by the twin - pore protein translocase ( tim22 complex ) in the inner membrane of the mitocondria @xcite . on the experimental side",
    ", it has been shown that the translocation of dna through a nanochannel can be modulated by dynamically changing the cross section of an elastomeric nanochannel device by applying mechanical stress @xcite .",
    "moreover , the width of the nanopore can be tuned by using thermally driven nanoactuation of the polynipam brushes inside the nanopore @xcite .",
    "the external driving force can also be time - dependent during the translocation process @xcite .",
    "as an example , polymer translocation has been studied for a time - dependent alternating driving force by means of langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "it has been shown that when the polymer - pore interaction is attractive , resonant activation occurs at an optimal frequency of the alternating driving force @xcite .",
    "there are some biological applications for the alternating driving force case such as translocation of linear and @xmath2-helical peptides through an @xmath2-hemolysin pore in the presence of an ac field @xcite , and monitoring the escape of the dna from an @xmath2-hemolysin pore by using an alternating current signal @xcite .",
    "moreover , using an alternating electric field in the nanopore has been suggested as a method for dna sequencing @xcite .    on the theoretical side , over the last few years",
    "a consistent theory of driven translocation has been developed based on the idea of _ tension propagation _ ( tp ) @xcite . within the tp theory ,",
    "the dynamics of driven translocation can be described by considering a tension force that propagates along the backbone of the chain .",
    "the dynamics is dominated by the drag of the _ cis _ side of the polymer chain , leading to asymptotic scaling of the average translocation time @xmath3 as a function of the chain length ( number of monomers ) @xmath1 @xcite , where the flory exponent @xmath4 is exactly @xmath5 in two and approximately @xmath6 in three dimensions , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , the theory reveals that the pore friction @xmath7 plays an important role for chains of finite length , leading to a large correction - to - scaling term such that the translocation time actually scales as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants @xcite .",
    "this scaling form has most recently been theoretically derived using the iso - flux brownian dynamics tension propagation ( iftp ) theory of driven polymer translocation @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our main goal is to investigate the influence of an alternating external driving force and a flickering pore on the dynamics of the driven translocation process . to this end",
    "we employ the iftp theory to theoretically study polymer translocation in the presence of a time dependent driving force through a flickering nanopore . here , the time dependent driving force , @xmath11 , is incorporated into the theory directly , while the effect of the flickering pore is implemented by a time dependent pore friction coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "using the iftp theory modified in this manner allows us to explicitly derive the tp equations for the present setup .",
    "the formalism also allows us to investigate both the influence of thermal fluctuations from the solvent by introducing randomness into the effective driving force  @xcite and the influence of the distribution of the initial configurations of the chain on the _ cis _ side  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we show how to model pore - driven polymer translocation in the context of the iso - flux brownian dynamics tension propagation formalism when the pore friction is time dependent and the driving force is alternating .",
    "[ scaling_oscillating_force ] and [ scaling_flickering_pore ] present the finite - size scaling form for the translocation time in the presence of an alternating driving force and time dependent pore friction , respectively . secs .",
    "[ average_translocation_time ] and [ sec_dynamics_trans_proc ] are devoted to the results on the average translocation time , the waiting time distribution , and time evolution of the translocation coordinate , respectively .",
    "conclusions and discussion are in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we use dimensionless units denoted by tilde as @xmath13 , with the units of length @xmath14 , time @xmath15 , velocity @xmath16 , force @xmath17 , monomer flux @xmath18 , and friction @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the segment length , @xmath21 is the solvent friction per monomer , @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath23 is the temperature of the system .    to elucidate the parameter values chosen in this paper , we compare them with those in real physical systems and also with those used in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in reduced lennard - jones ( lj ) units @xcite . here , parameters without tilde such as external driving force , @xmath24 , pore friction , @xmath7 , and time , @xmath25 , are in lj units . in md simulations",
    "the scale of time , mass , and energy can be fixed by the lj parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are the mass and diameter of each bead , and the strength of the interaction , respectively .",
    "we have chosen @xmath29 which is dimensionless and the time is scaled by @xmath30 . in our model",
    "the interaction strength is @xmath31 at room temperature ( @xmath32 ) , the mass of each bead is about 936 amu , and the size of each bead corresponds to the single - stranded dna kuhn length , which is @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the lj time scale is 32.1 ps . here",

    "we use brownian dynamics ( bd ) in the overdamped limit as the basic theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the translocation coordinate @xmath38 which is the chain length on the _ trans _ side is governed by the bd equation that can be written as @xmath39   + \\tilde{f } ( \\tilde{t } ) + \\tilde{\\zeta } ( \\tilde{t } ) \\equiv   \\tilde{f}_{\\textrm{tot } } , \\label{bd_equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the effective friction , the first term in the right hand side is the entropic force and @xmath41 is the surface exponent ( @xmath42 for self - avoiding chains in two and three dimensions , respectively , and @xmath43 for ideal chains ) , @xmath1 is the chain length or the total number of beads in the chain ( here the contour length of the polymer chain is @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 is the external driving force , @xmath46 is the total force , and the gaussian white noise , @xmath47 , satisfies @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    as both",
    "the _ cis _ side subchain and the pore friction contribute to the effective friction @xmath40 , it can be written as @xmath50 .",
    "for a fully flexible self - avoiding polymer chain , the dynamical contribution of the _ trans _ side to the dynamics has been shown to be insignificant  @xcite and it can be absorbed into the pore friction @xmath51 .",
    "note that here the pore friction @xmath51 is assumed to be a function of time .",
    "we solve the dynamics of the _ cis _ side by using the tp equations .",
    "following the arguments of rowghanian _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we are able to derive the tp equations analytically .",
    "we assume that the monomer flux , @xmath52 , is constant in space on the mobile domain of the _ cis _ side and through the pore , but evolves in time .",
    "the tension front which is the boundary between the immobile and mobile domains , is located at the distance @xmath53 from the pore .",
    "the external driving force inside the mobile domain is mediated by the backbone of the chain from the pore located at @xmath54 to the last mobile monomer @xmath55 which is located at the tension front . using the force - balance relation for the differential element",
    "@xmath56 located between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the magnitude of the tension force at the distance @xmath57 from the pore can be obtained .",
    "one can integrate this force - balance relation over the distance from the entrance of the pore to @xmath57 , to obtain the tension force at @xmath57 as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the force at the entrance of the pore ( see appendix a of ref .   for technical details ) .",
    "as the drag of all the preceding monomers diminishes , the mediated force closer to the the tension front becomes smaller and it vanishes at the tension front .    according to the blob theory , the shape of the mobile part of the chain can be classified into three different regimes . for a moderate external driving force ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , the monomer number density close to the pore is greater than unity , and the chain shape resembles a trumpet - like shape with the narrow end closer to the pore .",
    "this regime is called _ trumpet _ ( tr ) which is depicted in figs .  [",
    "fig : schimatic]a and b. for a stronger external driving force , @xmath62 , the force can only straighten a small part of the chain which is called the stem , and the part following it is called the flower .",
    "this regime is called _ stem - flower _ ( sf ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schimatic]c ) . finally , for a very strong driving force , i.e. @xmath63 , the force is strong enough to straighten the whole moving part of the chain , which is called the _ strong - stretching _ ( ss ) regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schimatic]d ) . in the tr and sf regimes ,",
    "the location of the tension front is at the farthest blob from the pore , while in the latter one , i.e. ss , the tension front is located at the farthest mobile bead of the chain from the pore as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : schimatic ] .",
    "the monomer flux can be written as a function of the total force and linear size of the mobile part by integrating the force balance equation over the whole mobile part : @xmath64 the effective friction can be obtained as @xmath65 by combining the definition of the flux , @xmath52 , with eqs .   and .",

    "[ fig : schimatic]a ) .",
    "therefore , the effective interaction between the pore and the beads becomes stronger and the result is that the value of the translocation time grows and reaches its maximum at @xmath178 . at this frequency",
    "the translocation process occurs during the first half period of the pore motion . during this first half of the cycle the radius of the pore decreases from its static value to its minimum and back to the static limit at @xmath178 , being always smaller than the radius of the static pore .",

    "this alternation of high and low pore friction creates successive minima and maxima in a way similar to the case of the time - dependent drive , except that increasing the pore friction leads to increasing translocation time , while increasing the drive leads to more rapid translocation .",
    "finally , we consider the combination of an oscillating drive and pore . the fact that increasing the drive or increasing friction work in the opposite directions with respect to the translocation time suggests that it could be minimized by out - of - phase combination of the two forces . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_translocation_time]a we present the normalized translocation time as a function of either the normalized pore frequency or force frequency , for mixed initial phases @xmath183 and @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , @xmath183 and @xmath187 , and @xmath188 and @xmath186",

    "limits the translocation exponent is the same as for constant driving and independent of the value of the initial phase @xmath118 .",

    "often the translocation process has been characterized by calculating the time evolution of the translocation coordinate @xmath38 . however , a more sensitive measure is the monomer waiting time distribution that measures the time a monomer spends inside the pore .",
