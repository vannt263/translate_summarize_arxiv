    "weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) by large scale structures ( lss ) is recognized as a powerful tool for probing the distribution of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "the details of this distribution depend both on dm particle properties and on the cosmological growth factor , itself a function of the equation of state , and thus weak lensing measurements can provide important constraints on cosmology ( kneib et al . 2003 ; sheldon et al . 2004 ; hoekstra et al . 2004 , 2005 ; clowe et al . 2006 ; mandelbaum et al . 2006 ; rozo et al . 2010 ; leauthaud et al .",

    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) wl convergence map is proportional to the density projected along each line of sight .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) peaks in the convergence map generally correspond to massive clusters ( hamana et al .",

    "shape noise from intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies and projection effects of the lss will produce spurious noise peaks , degrading the completeness and purity of cluster detection .",
    "such effects can also influence the wl signals of the lss , increasing the snr of smaller structures above @xmath6 .    as a cosmological probe , the peak abundance is complementary to the wl power spectrum , and is similar to galaxy cluster abundance ( dietrich & hartlap 2010 ; kratochvil et al .",

    "a major advantage of wl peaks and a motivation for their use is that they avoid the issue of having to identify genuine bound clusters and measure their masses .",
    "peaks can be directly compared to cosmological n - body simulations without the need to make the correspondence to observed or simulated `` galaxy clusters '' .",
    "since the abundance of wl peaks can be used as a cosmological tool , we expect their clustering to also be valuable . with simulations , marian et al .",

    "they found that the marginalized constraints are tightened by a factor of @xmath02 compared to the peak abundance alone , the least contributor to the error reduction being the correlation function .",
    "first we present the wl convergence map of the @xmath7-tile cs82 field , and study the wl peak statistics .",
    "we will analyze peak abundance , peak correlation functions and the tangential shear profiles around peaks .",
    "we count the positive and negative peaks in the mass map , measure the peak abundance as a function of snr , and compare with the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmological model using the analytical predictions by fan et al .",
    "we then measure higher - order statistics of wl peaks for the first time with real data .",
    "we investigate the correlation functions of wl peaks . for galaxies and clusters , we expect the correlation functions of wl peaks with different snr to be well - fitted with power laws .",

    "we also compare our wl peak detections with catalogs of overdensities detected via the red sequence matched - filter probabilistic percolation ( redmapper ) algorithm ( rykoff et al . 2013 ) .",

    "the red circles ( multi - circles ) denote the redmapper ( high richness ) clusters .",
    "while there may be some correlation between our wl peaks and the positions of the redmapper cluster candidates , there is generally not a clear one - to - one correspondence between individual peaks and individual clusters , presumably due to shape noise and projection effects in the lss .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the peaks in the wl mass maps , defining a peak as any pixel that has a higher values of @xmath39 than any of the surrounding eight pixels ( jain & van waerbeke 2000 ) .",
    "considering the data , we can find that the number of all wl peaks in each tile is related to effective galaxy number density ( see figure  [ fig : ng_nptot ] ) .",
    "we study three kinds of peak statistics : peak abundance , peak correlation functions and the mean tangential shear around peaks based on the mass map of the cs82 survey .    ]      to assess the reliability of this map , we shall first investigate the statistical properties of local maxima and minima .",

    "<S> we present a weak lensing mass map covering @xmath0124  @xmath1 of the canada - france - hawaii telescope stripe 82 survey ( cs82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the statistics of rare peaks in the map , including peak abundance , the peak - peak correlation functions , and the tangential - shear profiles around peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the abundance of peaks detected in cs82 is consistent with predictions from a @xmath2cdm cosmological model , once noise effects are properly included . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions of peaks with different signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) are well described by power - laws , and there is a clear cross - correlation between the sdss - iii / constant mass ( cmass ) galaxies and high snr peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the tangential shear profiles around peaks increase with peak snr . </S>",
    "<S> we fit analytical models to the tangential shear profiles , including a projected singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model and a projected navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) model , plus a 2-halo term . for the high snr peaks , </S>",
    "<S> the sis model is rejected at @xmath03@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the nfw model plus a 2-halo term gives more acceptable fits to the data . </S>",
    "<S> some peaks match the positions of optically detected clusters , while others are relatively dark . comparing dark and matched peaks , we find a difference in lensing signal of a factor of @xmath4 , suggesting that about half of the dark peaks are false detection .    </S>",
