    "these superlattices show some intriguing magnetic and superconducting properties , which are tunable by changing the superlattice structure .",
    "for example , the nel temperature in cein@xmath0/lain@xmath1(4 ) superlattices@xcite decreases to zero when the cerium layer thickness @xmath2 is reduced to @xmath3 , which is accompanied by a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity .",

    "f_-electron layers and in what way the kondo effect is observable in the non - interacting layers , which are in between the _ f_-electron layers . another interesting question which we will address is the influence of the superlattice structure on the low energy behavior of a kondo lattice : what happens to the full gap of the isolated kondo lattice layer , when it is coupled to metallic layers .    in order to answer these questions , an essential point is the proper treatment of the superlattice structure .",
    "therefore , we simulate systems which include two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ f_-electron layers and 2d non - interacting layers .",
    "the number and order of these layers can be varied , so that a variety of different superlattices can be studied .",
    "we are thus able to analyze these _ f_-electron superlattices and the kondo effect within these systems taking the structure of the superlattice fully into account .",
    "we find that the hybridization gap in the _",
    "f_-electron layers changes into a pseudo gap as soon as different layers are coupled to each other .",
    "however , the kondo effect in the _ f_-electron layers also strongly affects the density of states of the non - interacting layers , corresponding to yb- or la - layers in the above - mentioned experiments .",
    "we find that resonances , whose shapes depend on the superlattice structure and are influenced by interference from different _ f_-electron layers , appear at the fermi energy .",
    "these resonances have strong influence on the local properties of these superlattices and might be observable by local probes in experiments .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we explain in detail the model and the method which we use in our study .",
    "this is followed by a section where we study a single _ f_-electron layer within a 3d lattice .",
    "this kind of study will give insights into the physics which can be expected in the superlattice .",

    "the temperature - dependent conductivity , especially the influence of the superlattice on it , is analyzed in detail in reference.@xcite    .",
    "[ dopeaab ] ]    all results , which have been shown until now , have been for half filled lattices , for which each lattice site is occupied in average with one electron and the klls form the kondo gap at the fermi energy .",
    "if the chemical potential is changed , the system is doped away from half filling .",
    "however , the main statements about the kondo effect , which we have made , remain valid . in fig .",
    "[ dopeaab ] , we show the local dos of a ( 1,2)-superlattice for different chemical potentials . the structures ( peaks and dips ) in the dos of the nils are shifted . by doping the system , one of the side peaks in the dos of the nil",
    "is shifted towards the fermi energy . at the same time",
    "the gap in the klls is shifted away from the fermi energy .",
    "thus , even for the doped system the kondo effect of the _ f_-electron superlattices is of great importance and all our previous statements about interference of the kondo effect of different klls remain valid .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the local occupation of conduction electrons depends on the layer , see fig .",
    "[ dopeaab ] .",
    "thus the system forms a charge density wave corresponding to the superlattice structure .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that different materials or different microscopic models react differently to a change of the chemical potential . due to the local singlet formation between conduction electrons and localized spins in the klls , which energetically favors a state with one conduction electron per lattice site , we find that the occupation number of the klls is closer to one than the occupation of the nils",
    ". however , as the spatial symmetry along the superlattice structure is broken from the beginning by constructing the superlattice , there occurs no phase transition , but the charge density wave corresponds to the superlattice structure .",
    "we have calculated properties of _ f_-electron superlattices .",
    "we have elucidated the question , what happens to the full gap of the isolated kondo lattice layer , when it is inserted into a metallic host .",
    "we have shown that due to tunneling of electrons from the metallic layer into the kondo lattice , the full gap of the isolated kll is changed into a pseudo gap . however , by coupling the klls to the nils , not only the dos of the kll is changed .",
    "we have demonstrated that the kondo effect of the _ f_-electrons also has strong influence on the non - interacting layers , which show pronounced peaks or dips at the fermi energy .",
    "remarkably , these peaks and dips in the nils are strongly influenced by interference between the _",
    "f_-electron layers .",
    "while the configurations with an odd number of nils show a constructive interference , which enhances the resonance at the fermi energy , an even number of nils results in a destructive interference , canceling all visible effects of the kondo effect on the dos at the fermi energy in the ( 1,2)-superlattice .",
    "the kondo effect also strongly affects the conductivity at low temperatures . because of the formation of the kondo gap in the klls , the superlattice becomes strongly anisotropic at low temperatures .",
    "decreasing the temperature below the kondo temperature , the out - of - plane conductivity vanishes , while the in - plane conductivity stays metallic .    in this study",
    ", we have shown that the kondo effect plays an important role in the superlattice , not only in the _",
    "f_-electron layers , but also in the nils .",
    "the possibility to tune the physical properties such as the behavior of the kondo effect is one of the advantages of a superlattice .",
    "so far , we have only analyzed the paramagnetic state .",
    "if magnetically ordered states are analyzed , besides the kondo effect the rkky interaction will also become important . for weak coupling strengths",
    ", the rkky interaction will be stronger than the paramagnetic kondo screening , which will result in a magnetically ordered state .",
    "however , the heavy fermion materials which have been used in the experiments , i.e. cein@xmath1 and cecoin@xmath4 , show large regions in the pressure - temperature phase diagram , where the paramagnetic heavy - fermion state is stable .",
    "our results , which we have shown here , can be expected to be valid for this paramagnetic heavy fermion phase , where the kondo screening is stronger than the rkky interaction . because the kondo effect in competition with the rkky interaction plays an important role in _",
    "f_-electron materials , we expect that the tunability of the superlattice will result in intriguing phase diagrams including magnetic phases , which depend on the structure of the superlattice . including magnetic phases into our studies is left as a future project .",

    ". however , there are many naturally occurring layered _",
    "f_-electron materials , e.g. cecoin@xmath4 .",
