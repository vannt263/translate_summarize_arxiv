    "the observation of high energy neutrinos from beyond earth will open a new window on astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "presently much effort is being expended on designing and deploying detectors and methodologies capable of resolving the flavour of the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "one motivation for doing this is that the absolute sensitivity , or relative sensitivity compared with background , may be significantly greater for one neutrino species than the other species @xcite .",
    "another primary motivation for identifying the neutrino flavour is to test the hypothesis that neutrinos undergo flavour oscillation as they propagate from source to earth . indeed a number of atmospheric , accelerator and solar neutrino experiments hint at the existence of neutrino oscillations , although the experiments are not yet sufficiently consistent to delineate a unique solution @xcite .",
    "the most favoured solution , fitting the latest superkamiokande data , involves @xmath0 oscillation with a mass difference of @xmath1 . because the non - oscillation production of @xmath2 is assumed to be negligible relative to @xmath3 and @xmath4 production , and the cascade @xmath2 produced by collisions of primary @xmath3 and @xmath4 flux with the relic cosmic neutrino background is orders of magnitude less than the primary @xmath3 and @xmath4 flux , any detected @xmath2 component from a source outside the solar system is currently expected to be indicative of oscillation .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly report some results of our investigation into high energy @xmath2 production , presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we illustrate that the @xmath2 component at the high energy end in the hadronic decays is significantly higher than previously assumed and that this can have observational consequences .",
    "a number of sources for tev - uhe neutrinos have been postulated : for example active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite ; topological defects such as superconducting , ordinary or vhs cosmic strings @xcite ; supermassive gauge and scalar particle ( x particle ) decay or annihilation @xcite ; and hawking evaporation of primordial black holes @xcite . in all of these scenarios ,",
    "the final state particle distributions are expected to be dominated by hadronic decays at the source . in these",
    "decays over 90% of the final state emission will be @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , with the remainder mainly nucleons which decay into protons and antiprotons . on astrophysical timescales , the @xmath8 decay into @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that the final cluster states ( pions and nucleons ) in qcd jets at accelerator energies are well described by the fragmentation function @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the total energy of the decaying jet @xcite .",
    "this distribution continues down to @xmath15 gev . when convolved with the @xmath8 decay , eq.([primdecay ] )",
    "leads to , similarly , a dominant @xmath16 term in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra at @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "( for a full derivation of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra using fragmentation function ( [ primdecay ] ) see @xcite . )",
    "the production channels for the @xmath2 , however , are substantially different .",
    "the tau neutrinos are only produced in significant numbers once the tau lepton and heavy quark masses , @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 gev , are surpassed .",
    "the greatest contribution comes from the @xmath23 quark decay .",
    "because @xmath2 production is suppressed compared with other species , it has been assumed in flux calculations that the @xmath2 spectrum is orders of magnitude less than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra at all @xmath24 .",
    "this is not so .",
    "while indeed the total number of @xmath2 produced per jet is less than @xmath25 of the total number of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the high @xmath24 tau neutrinos are predominantly produced by the initial decays of the heavier quarks with shorter lifetimes and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are produced by the final state cluster decays of the much lighter pions .",
    "this leads to significantly greater relative contribution from @xmath2 at high @xmath24 than previously assumed .",
    "the fragmentation distribution ( [ primdecay ] ) is no longer relevant for the tau neutrino .    in fig.(1 )",
    "we show the @xmath2 spectrum , together with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra , generated by the decay of 10 tev @xmath26 jets . to simulate these spectra we used the qcd event generator herwig @xcite and the process @xmath27 , @xmath28 = all @xmath29 flavours .",
    "consistent spectra are obtained with pythia / jetset ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the region @xmath30 , the tau neutrinos make up more than one tenth of the total neutrino contribution .",
    "we also note that below @xmath17 , @xmath31 falls off with roughly an @xmath32 slope , and not the @xmath16 slope of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra .",
    "[ fig1a ]    because the 1 gev - uhe cosmic ray flux backgrounds are expected to fall off as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , we also plot @xmath35 in fig.([e2spect ] ) .",
    "[ e2spect ]    from our 300 gev - 75 tev simulations , we find that the @xmath2 spectrum generated by @xmath26 jet decay can be parametrized as @xmath36 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] per jet .",
    "similarly the number ( multiplicity ) of neutrinos produced per @xmath26 jet and the average neutrino energy scale as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 note that the average @xmath2 energy is significantly higher that the average @xmath3 and @xmath4 energies , consistent with our remarks above .",
    "we derive similar @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 parametrizations for the @xmath2 generated by initial @xmath43 decay , @xmath44 decay , @xmath45 decay , @xmath46 decay and decays which include extensions to the standard model ( e.g. susy and higgs sectors ) in @xcite .    in analogy with the use of the fragmentation function ( [ primdecay ] )",
    ", we now apply ( [ fragtau ] ) , and its high energy extrapolation , to investigate the neutrino fluxes produced in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios .",
    "to calculate the expected @xmath2 flux from a given astrophysical or cosmological source , the above @xmath2 fragmentation function , eq.([fragtau ] ) , must be convolved with the initial distribution of the decaying particles , the galactic or cosmological distribution of the sources and the redshift evolution and interactions of the emitted neutrinos as they propagate from source to earth .    here",
    "we briefly mention two scenarios .",
    "the new spectra for the tau neutrino fluxes expected from a number of other astrophysical and cosmological sources , including agn and primordial black holes , are presented in our paper @xcite .",
    "our first example is the vhs cosmic string scenario @xcite .",
    "however , our remarks apply generically to @xmath47 cosmic string models . in the vhs scenario ,",
    "1 gev - uhe particle fluxes are generated by the decay of supermassive scalar and gauge particles emitted by the long strings over the age of the universe .",
    "the neutrino spectra expected at earth from vhs strings with a mass per unit length of @xmath48 are shown in fig.(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath2 component which is solely produced in the collisions of the primary @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the relic cosmic @xmath49 neutrino background is represented by the dash - dotted line .",
    "( this is the only @xmath2 component presented in previous cosmic string papers . )",
    "the dotted line represents the @xmath2 directly produced in the hadronic decays of the string emission .",
    "as can be seen , our results give a significant increase in the expected @xmath2 signal at the highest energies .",
    "note too that because the cosmic ray background falls off as @xmath50 , the highest energy region of the spectra is most relevant to detection . in fig.(4 ) , we show the neutrino spectra from a viable vhs model with @xmath51 and the comparisons with present and proposed detector sensitivities .",
    "[ fluxescasc ]    as the second example , we briefly comment on the implications of our results for the simpzilla scenario .",
    "the annihilation of strongly interacting superheavy dark matter @xmath52 particles captured by our sun ( simpzillas ) has recently been explored as a source of observable @xmath2 @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath52 particle decays into 2 quarks or 2 gluons which then decay into jets . because of the high solar density",
    ", it is argued that only the @xmath53 chain in the @xmath52 decay would produce a significant @xmath2 flux capable of escaping the sun . assuming the fragmentation function ( [ primdecay ] ) applies to the @xmath23 quarks in this decay chain , the authors derive a distribution for the @xmath2 produced per @xmath52 particle decay which has a leading @xmath16 slope above @xmath54 .",
    "however , our full @xmath55 decay simulations show that the @xmath2 spectrum falls off with a much weaker slope , inconsistent with an @xmath16 slope from the partial decay . as a resolution to this discrepancy , we believe that the application of eq.([primdecay ] ) to the initial @xmath23 distribution from @xmath52 annihilation in the sun is inappropriate because the short - lived t quarks are generated in the first step directly by the @xmath52 annihilation , whereas eq.([primdecay ] )",
    "is a fit to the final state cluster distributions .",
    "thus the appropriate distribution of the @xmath23 quarks in this chain should be the initial distribution of the @xmath52 particles times the relevant branching ratio .",
    "this skews the expected @xmath2 distribution from solar @xmath52 annihilation to higher energies .",
    "the modifications are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "[ fluxesdat ]",
    "previous work has assumed that the @xmath2 component in tev - uhe hadronic decays is negligible compared with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components , at all neutrino energies . on examining qcd behaviour at accelerator energies and assuming similar behaviour continues to higher energies",
    ", we find this is not so .",
    "in particular , for neutrino energies in the decade below the energy of the decaying particle , the tau neutrino component is of similar magnitude to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components .",
    "below these energies the @xmath2 spectrum exhibits a slope of slightly less than @xmath32 compared with the @xmath16 slope of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra .",
    "this analysis modifies the expected spectra in many astrophysical and cosmological high energy neutrino production scenarios . as a consequence , the observation of a significant @xmath2 to @xmath4 ratio at a given energy in high energy neutrino telescopes and detectors may be due to hadronic decay at the source and not @xmath0 oscillation in transit .",
