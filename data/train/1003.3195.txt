    "the fundamental observation is that , for zero - error coding over a channel @xmath25 , two symbols can both be used as codewords only if they are not _ confusable _ , that is , only if the corresponding output distributions have disjoint support .",
    "therefore , a zero - error code is just a set of pairwise non - confusable input symbols in @xmath10 , and @xmath72 is the largest size of such a set .    in general ,",
    "it is not hard to see that for any of our resources @xmath17 , only the pattern of zeroes in @xmath69 can affect @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that the zero / one matrix @xmath73 encodes all the relevant information .",
