    "in the presence of joule heating , the static temperature of the conduction electrons of a metallic system is set by the heat balance between the heating and energy relaxation .",

    "@xcite more generally , such a situation with well defined separate electron and phonon temperatures is known as quasiequilibrium . in analyzing experiments or devices that involve heating ( or cooling@xcite ) effects of this kind , it is essential to be able to model the heat currents between the various subsystems.@xcite this is particularly important in two - dimensional graphene , which has a small thermal volume and is thus easily overheated . of central interest here",

    "( [ e.geop ] ) is quite complicated , but in the limit @xmath230 it may be carried out analytically for both mlg and blg .",
    "however , the expressions are complicated and we skip them here .    the numerical results for the prefactors @xmath231 are shown in fig .  [ f.qfactop ] . for the remote phonons we use @xmath232 and the values for 6h - sic ( see ref .  ) , where @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 mev , and hence @xmath236 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ f.qfactop ] that the prefactors for the remote phonons are considerably higher than those of the intrinsic phonons .",
    "this fact combined with @xmath237 means that for heat dissipation the remote phonons may in practice always be the more important ones .",
    "the limit @xmath232 overestimates the coupling constant somewhat , but @xmath238 decays with distance at most proportionally to @xmath239 , where for example for mlg at @xmath240 we find @xmath241 and thus @xmath242 nm when @xmath223 .",
    "the use of sio@xmath243 would reduce @xmath244 , but then one of the two modes with appreciable oscillator strengths also has a lower energy.@xcite the corresponding crossover temperatures between @xmath27 and @xmath245 are discussed below .",
    "let us briefly discuss the implications of our results .",
    "a common experimental situation where the heating of electrons occurs is that of a two - probe measurement with a finite bias voltage @xmath246 . the joule heat created at some point of the system",
    "is dissipated from the electrons in basically two ways , either by a transfer to phonons or by diffusion of the electrons away from the heated region ( _ e.g. _ , into the electrodes ) .",
    "the static situation is described by a heat balance equation @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the heat current density , while @xmath249 and @xmath250 are the local electron - acoustic phonon power and joule power per area , respectively .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the wiedemann - franz law applies ( see ref .  ) so that @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the heat conductivity , @xmath253 the electrical conductivity and @xmath254 is the lorenz number . to find some order - of - magnitude estimates ,",
    "we assume a quasi - one - dimensional situation with a sample of length @xmath255 , and consider the simpler , discretized equation @xmath256 with the diffusion power @xmath257 and joule power @xmath258 . we also concentrate on the low - temperature regime , @xmath259 for mlg and @xmath260 for blg , so that @xmath249 is of the form @xmath261 . here",
    "@xmath139 is the electron temperature in the middle of the graphene sample and we assume the acoustic phonons and the electrons in the leads to remain at the bath temperature @xmath262 .",
    "clearly , at low enough @xmath263 and bias @xmath246 the diffusion power dominates over the phonon power ( @xmath264 ) .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath262 or @xmath246 there is a crossover to an electron - phonon dominated regime ( @xmath265 ) . if @xmath266 then @xmath249 dominates also in the linear - response regime ( arbitrarily small @xmath246 and @xmath267 ) .",
    "for @xmath268 there is a finite crossover voltage @xmath269 , with the corresponding temperature @xmath270 .",
    "when the phonon power dominates , @xmath271 .",
    "since @xmath250 can be deduced from the current - voltage characteristics , measurement of the electron temperature in the presence of heating can also act as an indirect measurement of the electron - phonon coupling constant . to see",
    "if this regime can be reached before the low - temperature approximation for @xmath249 breaks down , we estimate the crossover temperatures . using @xmath272 ev",
    "we find for mlg @xmath273 and for blg @xmath274 where @xmath275 .",
    "these are only valid if @xmath276 .",
    "we find @xmath277 for mlg and @xmath278 for blg .",
    "since the electron - phonon interaction becomes more important for increasing @xmath255 , it seems possible to meet these criteria with long enough samples .",
    "the estimate could be improved by taking into account that @xmath253 also grows with @xmath13 differently for mlg and blg , and it may also depend on temperature.@xcite however , these details depend on the types of scattering . in practice ,",
    "the dominant form of scattering in graphene on a substrate is from impurities.@xcite experiments indicate that @xmath253 grows roughly linearly with charge density,@xcite which yields @xmath279 for mlg and @xmath280 for blg .",
    "we also note that the diffusion power can be reduced or even eliminated by the use of superconducting leads .    at high enough temperature",
    "there is another crossover , where optical phonons begin to dominate the electron - phonon heat transfer.@xcite although the conductance @xmath281 is exponentially suppressed at low temperature , @xmath127 is also small and for mlg quite strongly temperature - dependent , with @xmath282 at @xmath223 .",
    "this can lead to surprisingly low crossover temperatures . here",
    "we consider explicitly only the intrinsic lt optical phonon modes .",
    "figure [ f.ratioplots ] shows the ratios @xmath283 of optical and acoustic phonon thermal conductances for mlg and blg .",
    "as found previously,@xcite optical phonons can become dominant already well below room temperature ( @xmath284 k for mlg and @xmath285 k for blg ) , and the crossover moves to higher temperatures with increasing carrier density .",
    "the non - monotonous behavior@xcite of @xmath283 in the case of mlg is not present in blg .",
    "as found above , if the graphene is on a dielectric substrate , the dominant optical modes are most likely the surface modes of the dielectric.@xcite by using the parameter values quoted in sec .",
    "[ s.optres ] for sic and studying @xmath286 as in fig .",
    "[ f.ratioplots ] , we find crossover temperatures @xmath287 k for mlg and @xmath288 k for blg at @xmath223 . for sio@xmath243 , using the parameters quoted in ref .  , the results are as low as @xmath289 k and @xmath290 k , respectively .",
    "we note that the above results depend on the poorly - known parameters @xmath84 and @xmath291 in their second powers , while @xmath292 and @xmath293 also appear with high powers .",
    "this makes quantitative predictions difficult , and increases the need for an experimental determination of the coupling constants .",
    "finally it should also be noted that if the bias voltage exceeds the value @xmath294 v , scattering from optical phonons becomes very important also at low bath temperature.@xcite in this case the optical phonons can have a highly non - equilibrium distribution.@xcite    to conclude , we have calculated the power transfer between the electron and phonon systems in monolayer and bilayer graphene , assuming the existence of quasiequilibrium .",
    "in particular we have studied the coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons and different types of optical phonons . for the former",
    "we have calculated the power numerically and derived analytic expressions in low- and high - temperature limits .",
    "the power transfer to acoustic phonons dominates the diffusion power above a certain crossover temperature , estimated in eqs .",
    "( [ e.mlx ] ) and ( [ e.blx ] ) . at even higher temperatures",
    ", there is another crossover where optical phonons begin to dominate , and we have estimated also these crossover temperatures numerically ( fig .",
    "[ f.ratioplots ] ) .",
    "we find that for graphene on the substrate the most relevant optical phonons are likely to be the surface optical modes of the substrate .",
