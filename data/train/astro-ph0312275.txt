    "after a few decades of observation by several projects , the nature of the uhecr is gradually being revealed .",
    "based on the observational results , there is no doubt of the existence of uhecr up to @xmath1 ev @xcite .",
    "this has led to consideration of a large number of production models .",
    "most of the models assume that uhecrs are protons or photons .",
    "several studies of anisotropy have been done to reveal the origin of the uhecr @xcite . around @xmath0 ev , a large scale anisotropy which is correlated to the galactic center was reported by agasa group @xcite .",
    "this result , if confirmed , supports an interpretation that cosmic rays below @xmath0 ev are dominated by a galactic origin . above this energy ,",
    "however , no significant large scale anisotropy has been detected by agasa @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , agasa reported clusters in the distribution of arrival directions including 4 doublets and 2 triplets with energy above @xmath2 ev@xcite .",
    "this results indicate that the uhecr come from extra - galactic point sources .",
    "the cluster events reported by agasa are composed of particles with different energies .",
    "a possible explanation would be neutral particles ( like neutrinos ) propagating in straight lines from the source .",
    "another possible explanation would be charged particles with large rigidity , i.e. with small charge like protons .",
    "if there is only the effect of the galactic magnetic field then protons of different energy can arrive at same direction @xcite . however , these two possibilities can not explained the three bumps in the energy spectrum of the cluster events between @xmath3 ev and @xmath4 ev @xcite reported by agasa .",
    "this structure is not statistically significant .",
    "however , it suggests to us the interesting possibility that uhecr might be nuclei as it will be discussed in this paper . in this scenario ,",
    "cluster events would be formed by particles with different charge and energy but with the same rigidity .",
    "the atomic number of the primary cosmic ray does not affect the energy determination of agasa which measures the number of charged particles on the ground . however , the capability of agasa to measure the composition of the primary cosmic rays is not very strong @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of the energy distribution of the cluster events may be used to measure of the composition indirectly as discussed in this paper .",
    "if uhecr come from point sources and their rigidity is large enough or their source close enough so the direction is not lost , a fraction of the particles emitted by the source will arrive within a small angle from the source position .",
    "these particles are what we will call in this paper `` small deflection angle '' particles .",
    "clusters will be formed when the number of particles expected within this angle in our experiment is larger than one .",
    "the small deflection angle particles should represent the cluster events observed by agasa .",
    "uhe protons should interact with cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and lose energy by photo - pion production .",
    "for this reason , @xmath1 ev protons can not propagate in intergalactic space beyond 50 mpc , leading to a cut off in the spectrum below @xmath1 ev , the so called gzk cut off . on the other hand",
    "heavy nuclei will interact during its propagation with the intergalactic infrared background radiation(iibr ) .",
    "unfortunately the iibr can not be measured directly so far because of the strong background of infrared photons of galactic origin .",
    "the main component of the iibr is thought to be red - shifted stellar emission and reemission from interstellar dust .",
    "the uhe nucleus should be disintegrated by the iibr and lose energy by the photo - disintegration interaction .",
    "for this reason , it was believed that the attenuation length of uhe nuclei is shorter than that of protons in intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations which are based on empirical data show the iibr density is much lower than originally thought @xcite .",
    "the lack of absorption in the energy spectrum of very high energy gamma rays from agns strongly supports this calculation . using this result ,",
    "the attenuation length of the uhe nuclei in the intergalactic photon field was re - estimated @xcite and found to be longer than that of a proton ( a few 100 mpc for @xmath1 ev fe ) .",
    "we simulate the propagation of uhe nuclei which are emitted from extra - galactic point sources based on a monte carlo approach . using this simulation , we found structures in the energy distribution of the uhe nuclei which are observed as cluster events on the earth . in section",
    "[ sec : photons ] we briefly describe the interaction of nuclei with background photons . in section",
    "[ sec : magnetic ] we describe the scattering of the nuclei by the intergalactic magnetic field . in section [ sec : energy ]",
    "we show the result of this simulation .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] and discuss the results briefly .",
    "there are three processes which affect cosmic rays during intergalactic propagation : energy loss by interaction with cosmic background radiation ; deflection by magnetic fields ; and energy loss by adiabatic expansion of the universe .",
    "the effect of the adiabatic expansion is negligibly small if propagation distances are less than 1 gpc .",
    "there are four interaction processes of cosmic rays with intergalactic background radiation . the first process , compton interaction , is negligibly small for our purpose .",
    "the second process is pair - production of e@xmath5e@xmath6 .",
    "this interaction can occur if the energy of the background photon is greater than 1 mev in the rest system of the nucleus .",
    "if the lorentz factor of the nucleus is larger than @xmath7 , it will efficiently interact with the cmbr ( figure [ fig : f2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the energy loss rate ( @xmath8 ) is proportional to the square of the charge of the nucleus .",
    "the third process is photo production which mainly affects protons with energy greater than @xmath1 ev .",
    "the interaction of heavier nuclei with the cmbr by this process is negligible for the energy range considered in this paper .",
    "the fourth process is photo - disintegration .",
    "the nucleus interacts with the background photon and disintegrates to a lighter nucleus . in this paper",
    ", we calculate this process by a monte - carlo method according to @xcite .",
    "these authors parametrized the total cross section @xmath9 as a function of photon energy in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "then the probability of photo - disintegration per unit length @xmath10 is calculated by following equation : @xmath11      d \\epsilon\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energies of the photon in the lab frame and in the nucleus rest frame respectively , @xmath14 is the differential number density of photons including the cmbr and the iibr @xcite , and @xmath15 is the lorentz factor of the nucleus .",
    "the term inside the bracket corresponds to the angle - averaged cross - section for a photon of energy @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows characteristic time @xmath16 for the energy loss due to photo - disintegration for a single - nucleon emission process as a function of energy .",
    "@xmath16 is defined by following equation : @xmath17    the effect of the cmbr is maximized when the lorentz factor @xmath18 is around @xmath19 . in case of @xmath20 , this value corresponds to an energy of @xmath21 ev , yielding a value of @xmath22 s ( 2 mpc ) .",
    "because the iibr density is much lower than the cmbr density , @xmath16 increases rapidly at lower energy .",
    "@xmath16 of @xmath20 with @xmath1 ev is about @xmath23s ( 2.5gpc ) .",
    "in general , one or a few nucleons and a single lighter nucleus are emitted by this interaction . the lorentz factor is conserved at each photo - disintegration interaction , though it is reduced by the pair - production .",
    "finally , uhe particles will pile up at a lorentz factor around @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath24 is disintegrated , one proton and two @xmath25 are emitted .",
    "therefore no nucleus is created with a mass number between 5 and 8 .",
    "the interaction probability is calculated for every possible photo - disintegration process involving the emission of one or more nucleons for all nuclei lighter than @xmath20 .",
    "based on these probabilities , the propagation of the nucleus is simulated by the monte - carlo method .",
    "the effects of pair production , the adiabatic expansion , and photo - pion production for protons are taken into account analytically in this simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : life_of_fe ] shows the life of an @xmath20 nucleus whose initial energy is @xmath26 ev .",
    "the @xmath20 is disintegrated during its propagation and turns into a lighter nucleus with the emission of nucleons .",
    "when the nucleus is @xmath27 , four protons and four neutrons are emitted . then a @xmath28 is created . in comparison with energy ,",
    "the lorentz factor changes smoothly because photo - disintegration process does not change the lorentz factor .",
    "this process makes a lighter nucleus and nucleons with same lorentz factor .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields is described by the rigidity defined as the ratio of energy to charge ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "particles with small rigidity are deflected by the magnetic field and can not be observed as a cluster .",
    "the deflection of magnetic field increases the propagation time , and therefore particles emitted from distant sources may not reach to the observer .",
    "we calculate the effect of the intergalactic magnetic field based on a monte carlo method . to simulate the scattering by the intergalactic magnetic field , we assume a kolmogorov spectrum for the random magnetic field according to the reference of @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "authors divide space in a lattice of 250 kpc cubes .",
    "the lattice is filled with a random magnetic field which follows the kolmogorov spectrum with three logarithmic scales .",
    "three field vectors of random orientation are sampled at scales @xmath30 = 1000 , 500 , and 250 kpc with amplitudes proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the final magnetic field in each 250 kpc cube is vectorial sum of these three vectors .",
    "the average magnitude of the magnetic field is assumed to be 1 ng . particles propagate in spiral trajectories until they leave the lattice .",
    "figure [ fig : trace2 ] shows examples of the trajectories .",
    "@xmath20 with energy of @xmath0 ev does not rapidly lose energy by the interaction with photons , and is trapped by the magnetic field inside 1 mpc cubes . in case of @xmath32 ev , @xmath20 is disintegrated by the photons rapidly and the products propagates close to a straight line in the initial direction of the @xmath20 .",
    "in our simulation , the source energy spectrum @xmath33 is assumed to have a power law dependence @xmath34 and have a cut - off at the energy of @xmath35 ev , where @xmath36 is charge of each primary nucleus .",
    "below 300 mev / nucleon , the cosmic nuclear composition can be divided to 4 types : @xmath25 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath20 .",
    "nuclear abundance between @xmath25 and @xmath39 is relatively low as well as between @xmath40 and @xmath20 .",
    "we treat the composition as 4 components , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the fraction of these nuclear abundances in the uhe region are unknown .",
    "therefore we assume equal fractions relative to @xmath25 at the source .",
    "20000 particles are created for each nucleus .",
    "figure [ fig:180_d_fe ] shows the variation of the energy distribution after propagation from a single source initiated by @xmath20 through the photon and magnetic field .",
    "nuclei with lorentz factor above @xmath7 interact with the cmbr rapidly .",
    "after 1 mpc propagation a small pile - up is induced below the corresponding energy and the maximum energy of the particle is reduced . since we assume",
    "a cut - off energy in the source spectrum , protons are emitted with energies below @xmath45 ev where @xmath46 is mass number of the primary nucleus .",
    "the number of low energy nuclei ( @xmath47ev ) increases up to 10 mpc from the source since these nuclei are trapped by the magnetic field .",
    "these low energy nuclei can not propagate farther than few 10 mpc .",
    "therefore , the energy distribution becomes steeper for distances below 10 mpc and flatter for larger distances .",
    "no particles remain after propagation of a few 100 mpc .",
    "figure [ fig : psrc_50mpc ] is same result as lower left panel of figure [ fig:180_d_fe ] .",
    "the energy distributions at a distance of 50 mpc from the source are shown for different deflection angle ( angle between the arrival direction and the source position ) .",
    "particles with the deflection angle smaller than 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 180 degrees are counted ( 180 degrees corresponds to the entire sample of particles included in figure [ fig:180_d_fe ] ) .",
    "three bumps appear clearly in the distribution of particles with a small deflection angle .",
    "the bump below @xmath48 ev is composed of protons which are emitted from higher energy nuclei in the vicinity of the observer who is located at 50 mpc distance from the source .",
    "the bump around @xmath49 ev is composed of @xmath25 , and the bump above @xmath50 ev is composed of nuclei heavier than @xmath51 .",
    "these bumps can be explained as follows : the rigidity is proportional to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath36 is approximately proportional to its mass number @xmath46 while the lorentz factor is proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the lorentz factor of a particle is approximately proportional to the rigidity .",
    "therefore , if the lorentz factor of the nucleus is large , the energy is reduced by the photo - disintegration .",
    "if the lorentz factor is small , the particle is deflected by the magnetic field due to its small rigidity . however particles with lorentz factor of",
    "about @xmath55 remain after applying the deflection angle cut . as a result",
    ", the bumps appear in the energy distribution of the small deflection angle particles at positions dependent on the mass numbers .",
    "the combination of the photodisintegration and the magnetic field acts as a `` filter '' for @xmath56 particles .",
    "the energy distribution of the small deflection angle particles shows clearly the spectral features created by interactions with the intergalactic photon background and magnetic fields during their propagation .",
    "if the sources are distributed uniformly in the universe , the expected energy distribution measured at the earth can be estimated by adding up linearly the energy distributions corresponding to different distances from the source . in figure [ fig:180_d_fe ]",
    "the number of particles around @xmath1 ev coming from sources at 100 mpc is 1.5 orders of magnitude smaller than from sources at 100 kpc . when adding linearly the different distances , the number of particles from sources at 100 mpc is enhanced 3 orders of magnitude compared to sources at 100 kpc .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the energy spectrum at earth is increasing with the distance to the source till a couple of hundred mpc .",
    "on the other hand , most of the low energy particles emitted by distant sources will be trapped by the magnetic field and they will not reach the earth . however , the low energy secondaries resulting from the photodisintegration of high energy heavy nuclei close to earth will regenerate the low energy spectrum coming from distant sources .",
    "therefore , even at low energies we will still be dominated by the contribution of distant sources .",
    "the spectrum of small deflection angle particles will follow the same behavior , i.e. the contribution of sources at large distances to the spectrum exceed largely the one from small distant sources , even if the fraction of small deflected particles for closer sources is slightly larger .",
    "it should be noted that the relation between cluster events and small deflection particles is qualitatively clear but difficult to estimate quantitatively .",
    "current work is in progress for a better comparison with experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig : spect_all ] shows the result of the expected energy distribution under the assumption that the sources are distributed uniformly in the universe .",
    "the solid line shows the expected energy distribution of all the particles that reach the earth . the expected energy spectrum is steeper than the source spectrum . above @xmath57",
    "ev , the energy spectrum becomes even steeper and the maximum energy is about @xmath58 ev .",
    "the exact details of the upper end of the spectrum will depend on the source spectrum cut off .    the dashed lines in figure [ fig : spect_all ] show the expected energy distribution of the small deflection angle particles .",
    "this spectrum is much flatter than the source spectrum .",
    "four bumps appear in this figure .",
    "the bump just below @xmath48 ev corresponds to protons and strongly depends on the cut off energy at the source .",
    "the bump around @xmath59 ev is composed of @xmath60 and @xmath25 .",
    "every nucleus with a lorentz factor around @xmath55 contributes to the @xmath25 bump after propagation .",
    "the bump between @xmath50 ev and @xmath1 ev correspond to nuclei with mass between @xmath51 and @xmath61 .",
    "the bump above @xmath62 ev is composed of @xmath20 and other nuclei of similar atomic number .",
    "this total spectral structure bears a striking resemblance to the result of agasa @xcite .",
    "we have simulated propagation of uhe nuclei which are emitted from extra - galactic point sources using a monte carlo approach . using this simulation , structures in the energy distribution of the small deflection angle particles",
    "have been predicted . in this simulation",
    ", we assume that uhecr are nuclei which are emitted from extra - galactic point sources .",
    "the nuclei interact with cosmic background radiation and lose energy during their propagation .",
    "based on recent estimations of the iibr , it has been shown that uhe nucleus can propagate longer distances than a proton with same energy .",
    "it is also expected that heavier nuclei are accelerated more efficiently to high energy than lighter nuclei or protons .",
    "we have considered the effect of the intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "we use a kolmogorov spectrum for random magnetic fields that is 1 ng in average intensity with a 1 mpc correlation length .",
    "the energy distribution of the particles with deflection angles smaller than 10 , 5 , and 2.5 degrees are investigated .",
    "consequently , for this model no cosmic rays can be observed after propagation of a few hundred mpc .",
    "lower rigidity particles are deflected by the magnetic field relatively rapidly .",
    "particles with larger lorentz factor lose energy by photodisintegration . since the rigidity and the lorentz factor are proportional to the particle energy and inversely proportional to the mass number , particles which have common a lorentz factor , or similar rigidity , remain after the deflection angle cut .",
    "the @xmath63 bump appears at an energy more than 4 times larger than the @xmath25 bump , and the @xmath20 bump appear around 6 times larger energy .",
    "the rigidity gives a lower bound and energy loss gives an upper bound on the bumps .",
    "the energy distribution of the clustered events observed by agasa can be explained by this model .    in the simulation , we assume a specific intergalactic magnetic field distribution , cut - off energy and source composition of primary nuclei .",
    "the galactic magnetic field is ignored in this simulation .",
    "the events with certain deflection angle are selected and shows the effects due to the intergalactic photons and magnetic fields .",
    "this effect depends on the strength and correlation of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "this dependence gives an ambiguity to the analysis since the deflection angle cut is adjustable .",
    "therefore , this angle should be treated carefully .",
    "this result suggests that if we detect few hundred events above @xmath1 ev in future experiments , we should be able to extract the structure of the bumps in the energy distribution of cluster events .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is quite sufficient for this purpose and may confirm the signature of nuclei in the spectrum in the near future .",
    "we thank angela olinto , alan watson , james w. cronin , maximo ave , aaron chou , and medina tanco for useful discussions .",
