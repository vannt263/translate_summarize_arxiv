    "the bandwidth @xmath1 plays the role of the range of the interaction in the first case , the one of the square root of the number of independent conduction channels in the second . up to now",
    ", studies have been mostly devoted to the analysis of the stationary solutions of the schrdinger equation and to the corresponding spectral properties of brm s  @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the solutions of the time dependent schrdinger equation , a topic on which only a few studies have been performed  @xcite .",
    "the partial analogy of this latter problem with the ` dynamical localization ' phenomenon in the kicked rotor  @xcite suggests that an initial delta - like packet spreads diffusively and eventually saturates to a localized state .",
    "the width of this asymptotic packet for brm s is of the order of @xmath9 lattice sites , i.e. the same order as the localization length of all the eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "the theoretically predicted scaling laws for the mean square displacement @xmath2 were tested numerically and a comparison of the asymptotic form of the wave - packet with a theoretical formula  @xcite derived for the 1d anderson model was attempted  @xcite .",
    "more recently some new theoretical results appeared which give a formula for the time asymptotic packet in the brm model in the large @xmath1 limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it became important to check numerically this formula and to both investigate how the packet reaches its time asymptotic shape and measure the size of finite @xmath1 corrections .",
    "for what the time evolution is concerned some phenomenological expressions were suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a power - law convergence of the mean square displacement to its steady state value .",
    "however , the presence of large statistical fluctuations prevented the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite from assessing whether the time asymptotic scaling is ruled by power law corrections or by the logarithmic corrections to the @xmath10 dependence suggested by rigorous results obtained for the 1d anderson model  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath3 of the width of the asymptotic wave - packet with the realization of the disorder constitute an even more controversial issue , since not even the scaling behaviour is clearly understood .",
    "some evidence of an anomalous behaviour was presented in two previous studies of the same problem  @xcite and in the kicked rotor  @xcite . in all cases",
    "the numerics was too poor to make a convincing statement about the value of the anomalous exponent .",
    "the bottleneck of the previous simulations was the slowness of the integration scheme , a 4-th order runge - kutta with a small time step to obtain a good conservation of probability over a long time span .",
    "this low efficiency prevented from reaching sufficiently large values of @xmath1 and from considering a large enough number of realizations of the brm s .",
    "we have instead implemented a 2-nd order cayley algorithm , which , being unitary , exactly conserves probability , although the one - step integration error is larger than the one of the runge - kutta scheme ( a situation similar to those of symplectic algorithms in classical hamiltonian dynamics ) .",
    "this has allowed us to more than double the maximum bandwidth ( from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) and to increase the statistics by a factor four ( in the worst case ) .    as a result",
    ", we have been able to complete an accurate analysis of the time evolution of the mean square displacement , finding that there is no need to invoke effective formulas with a power - law time dependence even at relatively short times .",
    "we have found a clean evidence of an anomalous scaling of the relative fluctuations of the packet width , which behave as @xmath13 with @xmath5 . in order to confirm this anomaly ,",
    "we have investigated the statistics of the packet width at a specific time in the localization regime .",
    "the probability distributions at various @xmath1 values , when appropriately rescaled , superpose , and the resulting universal ( @xmath1 independent ) curve is definitely different from a gaussian with an exponential tail at large @xmath2 values .",
    "finally , we have compared our results with the theoretical formula for the asymptotic wave - packet  @xcite finding a convincing agreement .",
    "the finite @xmath1 corrections to the @xmath7 zhirov expression are of order @xmath14 .",
    "we have considered the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability amplitude at site @xmath17 and the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath18 is a real symmetric band random matrix .",
    "the band structure of the hamiltonian is determined by the condition @xmath19 the parameter @xmath1 setting the band - width ; the matrix elements inside the band are independent gaussian random variables with @xmath20 where the symbol @xmath21 stands for the average over different realizations of the disorder . in the present work we have considered the evolution of an ` electron ' initially localized at the centre ( identified with the site @xmath22 ) of an infinite lattice . to this aim",
    "we have analysed the solution of equation  ( [ schroe ] ) corresponding to the initial condition @xmath23    since the wave - packet evolves in a supposedly infinite lattice , it is necessary to avoid any spurious boundary effect due to the inevitably finite size of the vectors used in the numerical computations .",
    "this goal has been achieved by resorting to a self - expanding lattice , i.e. a lattice whose size is progressively enlarged according to the development of the wave - function . at each integration step ,",
    "our program checks the probability that the electron is in the leftmost and rightmost @xmath1 sites , adding @xmath24 new sites whenever the amplitude @xmath25 is larger than @xmath26 in at least one of the @xmath27 outermost sites .",
    "we have separately verified that @xmath28 is small enough not to significantly affect the computation of the probability distribution .",
    "for instance , by lowering @xmath28 by an order of magnitude , the mean squared displacement ( computed over the same disorder realizations ) changes only by a few percent . since this systematic error is not larger than the uncertainty due to statistical fluctuations , it is not convenient to reduce the cut - off as it would turn out in a slower code with a consequent reduction of the statistics .",
    "the schrdinger equation  ( [ schroe ] ) was integrated by approximating the evolution operator @xmath29 with the cayley form @xmath30 which implies that the values of the wave - function at two successive time - steps are related by @xmath31 solving the band diagonal system of equations  ( [ cayley2 ] ) allows one to determine @xmath32 once @xmath33 is known .",
    "cayley s algorithm is a standard tool for the computation of the solutions of the schrdinger equation ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first application to the specific field of random hamiltonians with long - range hopping . cayley s",
    "form  ( [ cayley ] ) for the evolution operator has two relevant features : it is second - order accurate in time and unitary ; in addition , the corresponding integration scheme  ( [ cayley2 ] ) is stable .",
    "stability is essential in order to study the long time evolution of the wave - packet ; as for unitarity , it ensures the conservation of probability and , together with second - order accuracy in time , allows one to choose time steps @xmath34 two or three order of magnitude bigger than those used in runge - kutta integration schemes .",
    "indeed , we could make use of a time step @xmath35 , to be compared with the time step @xmath36 used for the same problem in refs .  @xcite . to ascertain how large a @xmath34 could be used ,",
    "we have compared the solutions obtained through cayley s algorithm at various @xmath34 with the exact solution of the schrdinger equation  ( [ schroe ] ) , computed by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( to avoid boundary effects due to the finite size of the diagonalized matrices , we have considered sufficiently short evolution times ) . by this way we came to the somewhat surprising conclusion that the validity range of the approximate equality  ( [ cayley ] ) extended up to time steps as big as @xmath37 ( the scaling of @xmath38 with the band - width @xmath1 was necessary to compensate the opposite scaling of the energy eigenvalues with @xmath39 ) . to check this conclusion ,",
    "we have computed the mean squared displacement in the localized regime for several values of @xmath34 in the range @xmath40 , finding differences of a few percent , not larger than the statistical fluctuations .",
    "this can depend on the fact that the long time evolution of the wave - packet seems to be led by the eigenstates at the band centre .",
    "indeed , in the energy representation , the exact evolution operator and the cayley form can be written as @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the eigenvector corresponding to the energy @xmath44 .",
    "these equations show that , for increasing @xmath34 , the approximate equality  ( [ cayley ] ) holds true only in the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the band centre , while at the band edge , where the eigenvalues @xmath45 tend to @xmath39 , the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 become quickly different .",
    "therefore , the eigenstates at the band edges appear to play a minor role in the time evolution .",
    "this is probably due to the shorter localization length of such states compared with those in the centre : in fact , for the mean square displacement , all eigenstates are weighted with their localization length  @xcite .",
    "to investigate the time evolution of the wave - packet , we have computed the mean square displacement @xmath48    previous studies of this problem strongly suggest that @xmath49 satisfies the scaling relation @xmath50 for large enough values of the bandwidth @xmath1 . nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the most detailed numerical investigation has been carried out , it was not possible to obtain a clear verification of the scaling law  ( [ scal ] ) due to the poor statistics and the small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the faster integration algorithm described in the previous section has allowed us both to average over more realizations ( 400 in the worst case ) , i.e to reduce statistical fluctuations , and to reach larger values of @xmath1 ( namely , @xmath12 instead of @xmath11 as in ref .",
    "the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for several values of @xmath1 are clean enough to show a convincing convergence from above to a limit shape . in other words",
    ", there is no possibility to interpret the deviations as a signature of a different scaling behaviour for @xmath49 .    in order to perform a more quantitative analysis ,",
    "we have proceeded in the following way : @xmath51 to underline the residual but asymptotically irrelevant dependence on the band - with .",
    "] has been averaged over the time interval @xmath52 to obtain the more statistically reliable quantity @xmath53 . by assuming a dependence of the type @xmath54 we have fitted the three parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , finding that the convergence rate @xmath57 is very close to 1 ( 0.95 ) , i.e. that the finite - band corrections are of the order @xmath6 .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath55 is 0.61 .",
    "the results for the finite - band correction @xmath58 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the good quality of our numerical data suggests also the possibility to compare the temporal behaviour with the available theoretical formulas .",
    "in particular , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the existence of the so - called mott states should imply a @xmath59 convergence of @xmath60 to its asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , we propose the following expression @xmath61 which is the simplest formula that we have found able to reproduce also the initially linear ( i.e. diffusive ) regime . for each value of @xmath1 ,",
    "the best fit is so close to the numerical data of fig.[fig1 ] to be almost indistinguishable from them ( this is why we do not report the fits on the same figure ) .",
    "the meaningfulness of the above expression is further strengthened by the stability of the three free parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which allows the calculation of a @xmath1-independent diffusion constant ( see below ) . from the values of @xmath62",
    ", we can extrapolate the asymptotic value @xmath65 in exactly the same way as we have done for @xmath66 , finding once more a @xmath14-convergence to a value around 0.70 .",
    "this result is to be compared with the theoretical prediction @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of about 0.03 can be attributed to the accuracy of the integration algorithm .",
    "another important parameter that can be extracted from formula  ( [ fit2 ] ) is the diffusion coefficient . indeed , by expanding eq .",
    "( [ fit2 ] ) for small @xmath68 , we find @xmath69 the diffusion constant @xmath70 turns out to be close to 0.50 for all values of @xmath1 and , what is more important , close to the value that we obtain from a quadratic fit of the initial growth rate of the packet .",
    "this is a very encouraging result , since it confirms the correctness of formula ( [ fit2 ] ) for both the diffusive and the localized regimes .",
    "let us notice that the value @xmath71 is somewhat smaller than the one reported in  @xcite ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "taking into account statistical fluctuations and systematic deviations , we find that @xmath73 .    in past papers , a phenomenological expression involving a power - law convergence to the asymptotic value of the mean squared displacement has been proposed  @xcite , arguing that it should provide an effective description of both the diffusive and localized regime @xmath74 the success of expression ( [ fit2 ] ) shows that there is no need to introduce anomalous power laws to reproduce the numerical findings . however , for the sake of completeness , we have fitted our numerical data also with eq .",
    "( [ fit3 ] ) , finding an equally good agreement .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the quality of the fit we can not conclude which of the two expressions is better ; nevertheless , it is worth recalling that the former one has the correct asymptotic behaviour and , moreover , the fitted parameters are more stable .    a much more controversial situation exists about the fluctuations of the packet width .",
    "let us introduce the r.m.s .",
    "deviation @xmath75 in fact , it has not yet been clarified how the above variable scales in the large-@xmath1 limit . in particular , the correct value of the scaling exponent @xmath76 in the relation @xmath77 is still unknown ; this is why the @xmath1 dependence in @xmath78 is explicitly maintained .",
    "a scaling like @xmath79 would imply that the packet - width is not a self - averaging quantity , since the relative size of the fluctuations would not go to zero for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , an exponent @xmath80 corresponds both to self - averaging and ` normal ' behaviour .",
    "in fact , the number @xmath81 of independent channels ( lattice sites ) actively contributing to the localized region ( i.e. the localization length ) is of the order @xmath9 .",
    "if we assume that all such contributions to the second moment @xmath2 are independent of one another , then we are led to conclude that the relative fluctuations should decrease as @xmath82 , thus yielding an absolute growth as @xmath83 .",
    "since previous studies  @xcite have suggested a small anomaly , i.e. @xmath76 slightly larger than 3 , we have chosen to report the behaviour of @xmath84 for @xmath80 .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] reveals a drastically different behaviour from what observed in fig .",
    "first of all , the curves tend to grow for increasing @xmath1 ; moreover , there is no obvious indication of a convergence to some finite value .",
    "altogether , these features imply that @xmath76 is strictly larger than 3 , qualitatively in agreement with previous simulations .    in order to perform a more quantitative analysis ,",
    "we have computed the average of @xmath3 and rescaled it to the average of @xmath49 , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 is again to be interpreted as the average over the time interval @xmath52 ) .",
    "the advantage of this renormalization , already adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that it reduces finite - band corrections .",
    "the results reported in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , reveal a clean power law decay with an exponent @xmath87 .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the one found in the previous studies , but follows from a much cleaner numerics .",
    "a more global check of the scaling behaviour can be made by plotting the rescaled fluctuations @xmath88 for the various values of @xmath1 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath0 can thus be identified as that one yielding the best data collapse .",
    "the curves reported in the inset of fig .  [ fig4 ] have been obtained for @xmath89 .",
    "it is necessary to modify @xmath0 by at least @xmath90 units in order to see a significant worsening of the data collapse .",
    "accordingly , the best estimate of the anomalous exponent is @xmath5 , so that the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ scal2 ] ) is removed for @xmath91 .    in order to find further support for this anomalous behaviour",
    ", we have investigated the probability distribution @xmath92 for the second moment at the time @xmath93 ( the longest time we reached for the larger @xmath1-values ) , i.e. when the wave - function has almost entered the steady - state regime .",
    "the construction of reliable histograms has forced us to consider smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we have studied the cases @xmath94 , @xmath11 and @xmath95 , using @xmath96 realizations of the disorder in the first two cases and @xmath97 in the last one .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where , following a method suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have conveniently rescaled the probability distribution @xmath92 . in particular , defining by @xmath98 the average value of @xmath60 at @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath100 the standard deviation over the ensemble of disorder realizations , we have plotted @xmath101 vs. @xmath102 .",
    "after this rescaling , the distributions @xmath103 , corresponding to the three @xmath1 values , have zero average and unit standard deviation .",
    "it is remarkable to notice that all curves nicely overlap indicating a striking scaling behaviour .",
    "a further important feature is the deviation from a gaussian behaviour , especially for large values of @xmath104 , where a clear exponential tail is visible . the dotted line just above the three curves ( corresponding to the pure exponential @xmath105 ) has been added to give an idea of the decay rate which is slightly larger than 1 .",
    "the results of this analysis are important in two respects : i ) the exponential tail ` explains ' the difficulties encountered in getting rid of statistical fluctuations in the estimate of @xmath78 ; ii ) the deviations from a gaussian behaviour provide an independent evidence of the anomalous scaling behaviour of the fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting to remark that a preliminary quantitative comparison has revealed a striking identity of the probability @xmath103 with the distributions found in ref .",
    "@xcite for such diverse quantities as the magnetization in the 2d xy model and the power consumption in a confined turbulent flow .",
    "this close correspondence deserves further investigations .",
    "finally , we want to compare our results with the theoretical predictions for the asymptotic shape of the wave - packet . in  @xcite a reasonable agreement was found between the numerical data and the formula obtained by gogolin for strictly one - dimensional systems  @xcite . since",
    "a theoretical expression has been derived in the meantime for quasi-1d systems @xcite , it is desirable to compare our data also with this expression . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present the disorder - averaged probability profiles @xmath106 for large times , rescaled under the assumption  @xcite @xmath107 and compare them with zhirov s theoretical formula , which is denoted by the white line .",
    "no appreciable deviation is noticeable except for the extreme part of the tails , where it is reasonable to expect numerical errors due to boundary effects .",
    "the good overlap is partly due to the ( unavoidable ) choice of logarithmic scales in fig .",
    ". however , if we zoom the region around the maximum ( with the exception of the zero channel ) , one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] a slow tendency of the various curves to grow towards the theoretical expectation .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of @xmath60 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which reveals a convergence from above for the mean squared displacement .",
    "it is interesting to notice that all such deviations are mainly due to the finiteness of @xmath1 while the lack of asymptoticity in @xmath108 appears to be much less relevant .",
    "finally , we consider separately the zero channel , i.e. the return probability to the origin @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we plot this quantity versus @xmath68 for different values of @xmath1 . in all cases , a quite fast convergence , as compared with the behaviour of the packet - width , to the asymptotic value is clearly seen . in practice , as soon as @xmath68 is about 1 , the average value of @xmath109 reaches the asymptotic value .",
    "it is instructive to compare our numerical findings with the asymptotic ( in time and @xmath1 ) analytic expression @xmath110 . by fitting the dependence of the time average of @xmath111 ( in the interval @xmath112 ) on @xmath1 as in eq .",
    "[ fit1 ] ) , we find that the asymptotic value is about 5.7 and that the convergence rate is @xmath113 .",
    "the numerical value is in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical one , considering that it is the result of an extrapolation of data already affected by errors of the order of a few percent .",
    "the non trivial part of the result is the rate of convergence of this probability , which is definitely slower than the @xmath6 behaviour displayed by the second ( and other low order ) moments .",
    "the behaviour of the return probability , however , is in agreement with the theoretical predictions made in  @xcite , where the finite @xmath1 deviations from the asymptotic steady - state probability distribution were estimated to be of order @xmath8 in the @xmath114 neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the return probability is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where we plot the deviation @xmath115 from the asymptotic value @xmath116 as a function of @xmath1 in bilogarithmic scale .",
    "the displayed numerical values were obtained by averaging the return probability both over disorder realizations and the time interval @xmath117 ; the data were then fitted with two expressions , exhibiting deviations from the asymptotic value @xmath118 of order @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively . in the second case ,",
    "the exponent @xmath57 was used as a fitting parameter and the best fit value was @xmath121 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the power law with @xmath8 corrections fits the data much better than the one with deviations of order @xmath119 .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of an initial @xmath0-like wave - packet in a 1d disordered lattice with long - range hopping .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following .",
    "we have confirmed with clean numerics the scaling law  ( [ scal ] ) for the mean square displacement @xmath49 , first proposed and studied in ref .",
    "this scaling law is valid in the large @xmath1 limit ; here we have found that finite @xmath1 corrections are of the order @xmath6 .",
    "we have proposed formula ( [ fit2 ] ) for fitting the time evolution of @xmath49 towards its steady state value ; this formula contains the logarithmic corrections suggested by the existence of mott states .",
    "we confirm the presence of an anomaly in the scaling law of the relative fluctuations @xmath122 of the mean square displacement , finding that they vanish for large @xmath1 as @xmath123 .",
    "we have linked this anomaly to the presence of non - gaussian fluctuations of the mean square displacement .",
    "in fact , the probability distribution of @xmath49 displays an exponential tail for large values of @xmath49 .",
    "the conveniently rescaled probability strikingly coincides with the distributions obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for such diverse quantities as the magnetization in the 2d xy model and the power consumption in a confined turbulent flow .",
    "the degree of universality of such distribution deserves further investigations .",
    "finally , we have compared the numerical results on the steady state probability profile with the theoretical formula proposed by zhirov for large @xmath1 , finding a good agreement .",
