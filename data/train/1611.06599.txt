    "the lattice symmetry sets up the common and important feature of all crystalline magnetically - ordered materials : the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) .",
    "the mca determines such parameters of a magnetic medium as magnetization direction , magnetic resonances frequencies , coercive fields etc .",
    "since the mca relates directly to the lattice , applying stress to a magnetic medium allows modifying static and dynamical magnetic properties of the latter .",
    "this effect known as inverse magnetostriction or villary effect was discovered at the end of 19th century and is widely used in both fundamental research and applications .",
    "inverse magnetostriction plays a tremendous role in scaling magnetic devices down , e.g. in tailoring the mca parameters of nanometer ferromagnetic films by properly chosen lattice mismatch with substrate and providing sensing mechanism in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) .",
    "recently , the importance of inverse magnetostriction was also recognized in the emerging field of ultrafast magnetism focused at manipulating magnetic state of matter on the ( sub- ) picosecond time scale @xcite .",
    "magnetization control via the inverse magnetostriction at ultrashort timescale is based on the techniques of generating picosecond strain pulses in solids developed in picosecond ultrasonics @xcite . when an opaque medium is subjected to a pico- or femtosecond laser pulse , the light absorption and the following rapid increase of lattice temperature",
    "induces thermal stress in a surface region .",
    "this results in generation of a picosecond strain pulse with  10-nm spatial size and broad acoustic spectrum ( up to 100 ghz ) , which propagates from excited surface as coherent acoustic wavepacket .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally , that injection of such a strain pulse into a thin film of ferromagnet can modify the mca and trigger the precessional motion of magnetization @xcite .",
    "this experiment has initiated intense experimental and theoretical research activities @xcite in what is now referred to as ultrafast magnetoacoustics .",
    "high interest to ultrafast magnetoacoustics is driven by a number of features , which are specific to interaction between coherent acoustic excitation and magnetization , and do not occur when other ultrafast stimuli are employed .",
    "the wide range of generated acoustic frequencies overlaps with the range of magnetic resonances in the magnetically - ordered media .",
    "furthermore , thin films and nanostructures possess specific magnetic and acoustic modes , and matching their frequencies and wavevectors may drastically increase their coupling efficiency @xcite . finally , there is a well - developed theoretical and computational apparatus for high - precision modeling of spatial - temporal evolution of the strain pulse and respective modulation of the mca @xcite .",
    "these advantages , however , may be exploited only if the strain - induced effects are not obscured by other processes triggered by direct ultrafast laser excitation .",
    "generally , there are two main approaches to single - out the strain - induced impact on magnetization .",
    "the first one is the spatial separation , when the response of magnetization to the strain pulses is monitored at the sample surface opposite to the one excited by a laser pulse .",
    "it has been used in a number of experiments with various ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the irrefutable advantage of such an approach is that the laser - induced heating of a magnetic medium is eliminated due to spatial separation of the laser - impact area and the magnetic specimen .",
    "an alternative approach employs the spectral selection instead , when the initially generated strain with broad spectrum is converted into monochromatic acoustic excitation . in this case",
    "the efficiency of its interaction with ferromagnetic material is controlled by external magnetic field .",
    "this approach was realized in the experiments with ferromagnetic layer embedded into acoustic fabry - perot resonator @xcite and by means of lateral patterning of ferromagnetic film or optical excitation resulting in excitation of surface acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "very recently we have demonstrated that the strain - induced impact on the mca can be reliably traced even in a ferromagnetic film excited directly by a femtosecond laser pulse , despite the complexity of the laser - induced electronic , lattice and spin dynamics emerging in this case @xcite .",
    "we have utilized the specific mca of low - symmetry magnetostrictive galfenol film grown on a ( 311)-gaas substrate .",
    "furthermore , by applying external magnetic field along specific direction we were able to make the optically - generated strain the dominating stimulus triggering the magnetization precession .",
    "importantly , in addition to specific mca of the metallic film deposited on ( 311)-gaas , dynamical strain in it has two polarizations , quasi - longitudinal ( qla ) and quasi - transverse ( qta ) ones .",
    "they both contain shear component , and may provide much stronger modulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic films @xcite , as compared to the pure compressive strain in high - symmetry structures .",
    "therefore , such low - symmetry ferromagnetic structures are the prominent object for ultrafast magneto - acoustic studies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we summarize our recent experimental and theoretical studies of the ultrafast strain - induced effects in low - symmetry ferromagnetic galfenol films , where the dynamical strain of mixed , compressive and shear , character , serves as a versatile tool to control mca .",
    "we demonstrate the modulation of the mca and the corresponding response of magnetization under two different experimental approaches , when the strain pulses are injected into the film from the substrate , and when the strain with a step - like temporal profile is optically generated directly in a ferromagnetic film . in the case of direct optical excitation",
    "we also compare the strain - induced change of mca to the conventional change of anisotropy via optically - induced heating emerging , and demonstrate that these two contributions can be unambiguously distinguished and suggest the regimes at which either of them dominates .",
    "finally , we note that microscopical mechanisms of the mca changes are the same in the case of purely acoustical and direct optical excitation . however , difference between the temporal profile of the optically - generated strain , pulse- vs. step - like , results in difference in magnetization precession trajectories excited via these two approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : exp ] we describe the sample under study and three experimental geometries which enable us to investigate various contributions to ultrafast control of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "in sec.[sec : theorymag ] we describe phenomenologically magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the ( 311 ) galfenol film and consider various approaches to its control by femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "the following sec.[sec : theoryac ] is devoted to generation of dynamical strain in metallic films of low symmetry . in secs.[sec",
    ": expac],[sec : extopt ] we present experimental results and analysis of the magnetization precession triggered by purely acoustical pump and by direct optical excitation and demonstrate that even in the latter case optically - generated strain may be a dominant impact allowing ultrafast control of the mca .",
    "film of a galfenol alloy fe@xmath0ga@xmath1 ( thickness @xmath2=100 nm ) was grown on the ( 311)-oriented gaas substrate ( @xmath3=100@xmath4 m ) ( fig.[fig : exp](a ) ) by the magnetron sputtering technique .",
    "although the film is polycrystalline , the misorientation of crystallographic axes of crystallites , average size of which was of a few nanometers , was not exceeding a few degrees . therefore , the studied film can be treated as the single crystalline one .",
    "the equilibrium value of the saturation magnetization is @xmath5=1.59 t @xcite .",
    "the squid measurements confirmed that the easy magnetization axis is oriented in the film plane along the [ 0@xmath61 ] crystallographic direction ( @xmath7-axis ) . in our experiments external dc magnetic field * b * was applied in the sample plane along the magnetization hard axis , which lies along [ @xmath833 ] crystallographic direction ( @xmath9-axis ) . in this geometry magnetization * m * orients along the applied field if the strength of the latter exceeds @xmath10=150mt . at lower field strengths magnetization is along an intermediate direction between the @xmath9- and @xmath7-axes .",
    "three experimental geometries were used in order to explore the impact of dynamical strain on the mca of the galfenol film .",
    "first , the experiments were performed with the dynamical strain being the only stimulus acting on the galfenol film ( fig.[fig : exp](b ) ) .",
    "a 100-nm thick al film was deposited on the back side of the gaas substrate and was utilized as an optoacoustic transducer to inject picosecond strain pulses into the substrate @xcite .",
    "the 100-fs optical pump pulses with the central wavelength of 800 nm , generated by a ti : sapphire regenerative amplifier , were incident on the al film inducing rapid increase of its temperature . as a result , as discussed in detail in sec.[sec : theoryac ] , the picosecond qta and qla strain pulses were injected into the gaas substrate .",
    "these pulses propagated through the substrate with velocities of @xmath112.9km@xmath12s@xmath13 and @xmath145.1km@xmath12s@xmath13 , respectively @xcite . upon reaching the ( fe , ga ) film , after 35 and 20ns , respectively , they acted on the film , modified its mca and triggered the magnetization precession @xcite",

    "( b ) the optical pump pulses excite 100 nm thick al film on the back of the gaas substrate , thus generating qta and qla strain pulses injected into the substrate .",
    "they act as the acoustical pump triggering the magnetization precession in the galfenol film .",
    "the precession is detected by monitoring the rotation of polarization plane of the probe pulses reflected from the galfenol film .",
    "( c ) the optical pump pulses excite the galfenol film directly .",
    "the propagating strain pulses are detected by monitoring polarization rotation for the probe pulses , which penetrate into the gaas substrate .",
    "( d ) the optical pump pulses excite the galfenol film directly , increasing the lattice temperature and generating the dynamical strain in the film .",
    "excited magnetization precession is detected by monitoring the rotation of polarization of the probe pulses reflected from the galfenol film .",
    "experiment ( b ) was performed at @xmath1720k , experiments ( c , d ) were performed at room temperature.,width=566 ]    the probe pulses split from the same beam were incident on the ( fe , ga ) film at the angle close to 0 , and the time - resolved polar magneto - optical kerr effect ( trmoke ) was measured . in this experimental geometry , trmoke rotation angle @xmath18 is directly proportional to the out - of - plane deviation of magnetization @xmath19 induced by a pump : @xmath20^{-1}\\chi_{xyz}\\delta m_z(t),\\label{eq : trmoke}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the diagonal dielectric permittivity tensor component of ( fe , ga ) at the probe wavelength , @xmath22 is the magneto - optical susceptibility at the same wavelength , which enters off - diagonal dielectric permittivity component as @xmath23 @xcite . by normalizing trmoke rotation by the static one at saturation ( @xmath24 ) , one gets the measure of deviation of the magnetization out of the sample plane , @xmath25 .",
    "these experiments were performed at @xmath26=20k .",
    "second and the third types of experiments ( fig.[fig : exp](c , d ) ) were conducted in the geometry , where the ( fe , ga ) film was directly excited by the optical pump pulses . in this case the lattice temperature of the film was rapidly increased resulting , in particular , in generation of the dynamical strain in the magnetic film , with complex temporal evolution discussed in details in sec.[sec : theoryac ] .",
    "thus , in this geometry there were two contribution to the change of mca : ( i ) direct modification of the mca due to heating @xcite and ( ii ) inverse magnetostrictive effects . in these experiments we used 170-fs pump and probe pulses of the 1030-nm wavelength generated by the yb : kgd(wo@xmath27)@xmath28 regenerative amplifier .",
    "these experiments were performed at room temperature .    in the second geometry",
    "the probe pulses were incident onto the back side of the gaas substrate ( fig.[fig : exp](c ) ) .",
    "since the probe pulses wavelength is well below the gaas absorption edge , it penetrated the substrate and reached the magnetic film .",
    "thus , here we were able to probe optically excited dynamics of the magnetization of the ( fe , ga ) film .",
    "additionally , this experimental geometry enables one to detect strain pulses injected into the substrate from the film . upon propagation through gaas",
    "these pulses modified its dielectric permittivity via photoelastic effect .",
    "the intensity and the polarization of the probe pulses were therefore modified in the oscillating manner @xcite , with the frequency @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probe wavelength , @xmath21 is the dielectric permittivity of gaas , and the angle of incidence for the probe pulses is taken to be 0 .",
    "these oscillations are often referred to as brillouin oscillations .",
    "the main purpose of this experiment was to confirm generation of dynamical strain upon excitation of the ( fe , ga ) film by optical pump pulses .",
    "third type of experiments was performed in the conventional optical pump - probe geometry , when both optical pump and probe pulses were incident directly on the galfenol film ( fig.[fig : exp](d ) ) .",
    "this is the main experiment in our study , which demonstrates how various contributions to the optically - induced mca change can be distinguished and separated .",
    "the magnetic part of the normalized free energy density of the single crystalline galfenol film @xmath31 grown on the ( 311)-gaas substrate ( fig.[fig : exp](a ) ) can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 . here for a sake of convenience zeeman , shape and uniaxial anisotropy terms are written in the coordinate frame associated with the film , i.e the @xmath34-axis is directed along the sample normal .",
    "cubic anisotropy term and the magneto - elastic terms are written in the frame given by the crystallographic axes @xmath35 ( fig.[fig : exp](a ) ) .",
    "strain components @xmath36 are considered to be zero at equilibrium .",
    "corresponding equilibrium orientation of magnetization is given by the direction of an effective magnetic field expressed as @xmath37    rapid change of any of the terms in eq.([eq : energy ] ) under an external stimulus may result in reorientation of the effective field ( [ eq : beff ] ) and thus trigger magnetization precession , which can be described by the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "we leave beyond the scope of this paper discussion on mechanisms which manifest themselves as transient magnetic fields @xmath40 induced by the femtosecond laser pulses ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also exclude the ultrafast laser - induced demagnetization @xcite , which contributes through the decrease of the demagnetizing field @xmath41 and may trigger the magnetization precession @xcite .",
    "this contribution is proportional to @xmath34-component of @xmath42 at equilibrium , which is zero in the experimental geometry discussed here , with magnetic field applied in the film plane .",
    "thus , we focus on the effects related to the change of the mca solely and consider two mechanisms .",
    "first mechanism allowing ultrafast change of the mca relies on changes of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite in eq.([eq : energy ] ) .",
    "absorption of laser pulse ultimately results in increase of the lattice temperature on a picosecond time scale .",
    "lattice heating , in turn , results in decrease of magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters , which are temperature - dependent .",
    "particular details of the energy transfer involved in this process are dependent on electronic structure of a medium @xcite",
    ". such ultrafast change of the mca is often referred to as the _ heat - induced _ , or thermal one .",
    "importantly , this mechanism is expected to be efficient if magnetization is not aligned along the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this can be realized by applying magnetic field of moderate strength along the hard magnetization axis .",
    "otherwise , decrease of @xmath45 would not tilt @xmath46 already aligned along @xmath47 .",
    "second mechanism relies on inverse magnetostriction . as it follows from eq.[eq : energy ] , dynamical strain @xmath48 induced in a magnetic film can effectively change the mca . when this change occurs on a timescale much shorter than the characteristic times of the magnetization precession ,",
    "the latter is launched .",
    "such dynamical strain can be created in a film either upon injection from the substrate @xcite , or due to the thermal stress induced by rapid increase of the lattice temperature by optical pulse .",
    "importantly , in these two cases there is significant difference in temporal profile of the dynamical strain in the magnetic film , as discussed in details in the following section .",
    "it is important to stress , that , in contrast to the heat - induced change of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants , the _ strain - induced _ mechanism can be efficient even if the @xmath46 is aligned along @xmath47 , if the symmetry of the film and the polarization of the dynamical strain are properly chosen .",
    "this is demonstrated in sec.[sec : extopt ] and in @xcite .",
    "when the metallic film is excited by a femtosecond laser pulse , electronic temperature @xmath49 is rapidly increased on a subpicosecond time scale .",
    "subsequent thermal diffusion and thermalization with the lattice is described by the coupled differential equations @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the absorbed optical pump pulse power density , with @xmath52 describing the gaussian temporal profile , @xmath53 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath54 is the reflection fresnel coefficient . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the specific electronic and lattice heat capacities , respectively ; @xmath57 - the thermal conductivity , @xmath58 - the electron - phonon coupling constant , considered to be temperature independent .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath56 stand for the lattice temperature and the specific lattice heat capacity , respectively .",
    "heat conduction to the substrate is usually much less than the one within the film and , thus , is neglected .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath60 at @xmath34=0 , and @xmath49=@xmath59=@xmath26 at @xmath61 , where @xmath26 is the initial temperature .",
    "lattice temperature increase sets up the thermal stress , which in turn leads to generation of dynamical strain @xcite .",
    "details of this process are determined by the properties of the metallic film and of the interface between the metallic film and the substrate . as a generalization",
    ", we consider the strain mode with the polarization vector @xmath62 and the amplitude @xmath63 . following the procedure described in @xcite for a high - symmetry film",
    "we express the displacement amplitude in the frequency domain as @xmath64;\\label{eq : tempe}\\\\ \\delta t_l(z,\\omega)&=&\\frac{\\delta t_e(z,\\omega)}{1-i\\omega c_lg^{-1}};\\label{eq : templ}\\\\ u_{0,j}(z,\\omega)&=&\\sigma_j\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\alpha z}}{\\alpha^2+k_j^2}-\\frac{e^{-p_tz}}{p_t^2+k_j^2}+\\frac{e^{k_jz}}{2ik_j}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha+ik_j}-\\frac{1}{p_t+ik_j}\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\frac{e^{-k_jz}}{2ik_j}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha - ik_j}+\\frac{1}{p_t - ik_j}\\right]\\right)+a_je^{ik_jz}+b_je^{-ik_jz},\\label{eq : strain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the parameters @xmath65 here @xmath66 is gruneisen parameter , @xmath67 is the galfenol density .",
    "the constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 are determined from the boundary condition at the free surface @xmath70 and at the ( 311)fega / gaas interface . from eq.([eq : strain ] ) it can be seen that thermal stress induces two contributions to the strain in the metallic film .",
    "first one is maximal at the film surface and decays exponentially along @xmath34 , which is shown schematically in figs.[fig : exp](b - d ) .",
    "in fact , it closely follows spatial evolution of the lattice temperature @xmath59 in eq.([eq : templ ] ) . in the time domain ,",
    "this contribution emerges on a picosecond time scale following lattice temperature increase and decays slowly towards equilibrium due to the heat transfer to the substrate .",
    "therefore , on the typical time scale of experiment on ultrafast control of the mca , i.e @xmath711ns , this contribution can be considered as the step - like strain emergence .",
    "second contribution describes the picosecond _ strain pulse _ propagating away from the film surface along @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "first we consider the scenario illustrated in fig.[fig : exp](b ) .",
    "the al film serving as the optoacoustic transducer , is polycrystalline and , thus , acoustically isotropic .",
    "thus , longitudinal ( la ) strain is generated due to optically - induced thermal stress .",
    "its polarization vector is @xmath72 and the amplitude is @xmath73 .",
    "corresponding strain component is @xmath74 . due to mode conversion at the interface transversal strain",
    "may be also generated , but the efficiency of this process is low @xcite .",
    "after transmission of the strain pulse through the interface between elastically isotropic al film and anisotropic low - symmetry single crystalline ( 311)-gaas substrate , two strain pulses emerge , qla and qta , with the polarization vectors @xmath75=(0.165,0,0.986 ) and @xmath76=(0.986,0,-0.165 ) , propagating further to the substrate @xcite . expressions for the corresponding amplitudes are found in @xcite by taking into account interference between la and ta modes within the film and multiple reflections and mode conversion at the interface .",
    "qla and qta pulses injected thus into gaas substrate propagate with their respective sound velocities .    upon reaching magnetic ( fe , ga ) film",
    "these strain pulses can trigger the magnetization precession @xcite , by modifying magneto - elastic terms in eq.([eq : energy ] ) . strictly speaking",
    ", since polarization vectors of ql(t)a in ( fe , ga ) and in gaas differ , transformation of the strain pulses upon crossing gaas/(fe , ga ) interface should be taken into account .",
    "however , since the mismatch is rather small and both ql(t)a strain pulses remain polarized in the @xmath77 plane , we neglect it in the analysis . therefore , in the experimental geometry , shown in fig.[fig : exp](b ) , propagating strain pulses ( [ eq : strain ] ) are employed to control magnetization .",
    "this situation changes if one directly excites the magnetic film by the laser pulse @xcite .",
    "by contrast to polycrystalline al film , in the single crystalline ( fe , ga ) film on the ( 311)-gaas substrate the elastic anisotropy plays essential role in the strain generation .",
    "two strain components @xmath78 and @xmath79 arise due to coupling of thermal stress to qla and qta acoustic waves .",
    "their polarizations are @xmath75=(0.286,0,0.958 ) and @xmath76=(0.958,0,-0.286 ) @xcite in the film coordinate frame @xmath80 ( fig.[fig : exp](a ) ) .",
    "corresponding strain components can be found as @xmath81 i.e. the generated strain is of mixed , compressive and shear , character . in general , mca can be modified via both , step - like emergence of the strain @xcite and propagating pulses @xcite .",
    "importantly , since the step - like emergence of the strain closely follows temporal and spatial evolution of the lattice temperature , distinguishing their effect on the magnetic anisotropy can be ambiguous .",
    "however , as we show below , in the case of low symmetry film , i.e. ( 311)-galfenol , these contributions can be easily separated in experiment ( sec.[sec : extopt ] ) .",
    "we note , that possible contribution from this step - like emergence of the strain to the change of mca was pointed out in @xcite , however , no detailed consideration was performed allowing to confirm feasibility of this process .",
    "we note also that in the case of optically excited single - crystalline ( fe , ga ) film the qla and qta strain pulses will be also injected into gaas , and can be detected employing the scheme shown in fig.[fig : exp](c ) .",
    "these strain pulses are not expected to contribute to the mca changes .",
    "the numerical calculation show that the contribution of these strain pulses to the mca changes is negligible @xcite .",
    "first we examine excitation of the magnetization precession by dynamical strain only , which is realized in the experimental geometry shown in fig.[fig : exp](b ) . in fig.[fig : acexprecession](a ) we present changes of the probe polarization rotation measured as a function of pump - probe time delay @xmath82 after qla or qta strain pulse arrives to the galfenol film .",
    "time moment @xmath82=0 for each shown trace corresponds to the time required for either qla or qta pulse to travel through the 100@xmath4 m thick gaas substrate , and was verified by monitoring reflectivity change @xcite .",
    "as one can see , both the qla and qta pulses excite oscillations of the probe polarization .",
    "two lines are clearly seen in the fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectra of the time traces ( fig.[fig : acexprecession](b ) ) separated by few ghz . frequencies of both lines change with the applied field ( fig.[fig : acexprecession](c ) ) , thus confirming that the observed oscillations of the probe polarization originate from the magnetization precession triggered by qla and qta strain pulses .",
    "the character of the field dependence of @xmath83 ( fig.[fig : acexprecession](c ) ) corresponds to the one expected for the geometry , when the external magnetic field is applied along the magnetization hard axis .",
    "presence of two field dependent frequencies in the fft spectra can be attributed to the excitation of two spin wave modes , which is one of the signatures of the magnetization precession excited by picosecond acoustic pulses . as discussed in details in @xcite excitation of several spin waves",
    "is enabled by the broad spectrum of the strain pulses and is governed by the boundary conditions in the thin film .",
    "measured in the geometry shown in fig.[fig : exp](b ) at various values of the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath82=0 is the moment of arrival of the qla or qta pulse to the galfenol film .",

    "( c ) frequency of the probe polarization oscillations caused magnetization precession excited by qla ( closed symbols ) and qta ( open symbols ) phonons .",
    "optical pump fluence was of @xmath84=40mj@xmath12@xmath85 .",
    "note , that in ( a ) the curves are shifted along the vertical axis for a sake of clarity.,width=566 ]    as discussed in secs.[sec : theorymag],[sec : theoryac ] , both the qla and qta pulses contain components @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( [ eq : strainampl ] ) and consequently contribute to the change of the magneto - elastic term in the free energy in eq.([eq : energy ] ) , thus modifying the mca of the film .",
    "the qla ( qta ) strain pulse enters the magnetic film and propagates though it with the sound velocity of @xmath86=6.0km@xmath12s@xmath13 ( @xmath87=2.8km@xmath12s@xmath13 ) . upon propagation",
    "it modifies the mca thus causing effective magnetic field @xmath46 to deviate from its equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "magnetization starts to move away from its equilibrium orientation following complex trajectory @xcite .",
    "ql(t)a strain pulse leaves the film after @xmath88 , i.e. 33 and 70ps , respectively , and @xmath46 returns to its equilibrium value , while magnetizations relaxes towards @xmath46 precessionally on the much longer nanosecond time scale .    as seen from fig.[fig : acexprecession](a ) , amplitude of the magnetization precession excited by qla phonons is higher than of that excited by qta phonons .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental and theoretical results on propagation of qla and qta phonons through the ( 311)-gaas substrate @xcite , which showed that the amplitude of the displacement associated with the qta pulses is smaller by a factor of @xmath715 than that of qla , while the magnetoelastic coefficients for the shear and compressive strain are the same in galfenol .",
    "our experiment on excitation of the ( 311)-(fe , ga ) film by the picosecond strain pulses clearly demonstrates that dynamical strain effectively excites the magnetization precession in the film .",
    "we note that here we reported the magnetization excitation in the particular geometry , when the magnetic field is applied along the magnetization hard axis .",
    "previously some of the authors also demonstrated analogous excitation in ( fe , ga ) with the field applied in the ( 311 ) plane at 45@xmath89 to [ @xmath833 ] direction , as well as in the field applied along the [ 311 ] axis @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that all the features of the excitation observed at low temperature remain valid at room temperature as well .",
    "thus , reported here results obtained at @xmath26=20k can be reliably extrapolated to the room temperature , at which the direct optical excitation of the precession in the galfenol film was studied .",
    "while in the experiments described in sec.[sec : expac ] picosecond strain pulses are the only stimulus driving the magnetization precession , the processes triggered by direct optical excitation of a metallic magnetic film are more diverse , and may contribute to both strain - related and other driving forces ( see sec.[sec : theorymag ] ) .",
    "first , in order to confirm generation of dynamical strain ( coherent phonons ) in the optically - excited galfenol film we have detected propagating qla and qta strain pulses by measuring the polarization rotation for the probe pulses incident onto the back side of the ( 311 ) ( fe , ga)/gaas sample ( fig.[fig : exp](c ) ) .",

    "this experiment , therefore , confirms concomitant generation of the dynamical strain and excitation of the magnetization precession in the optically excited galfenol film .",

    "fft spectra ( fig.[fig : direxprecession](c ) ) contain one line with field dependent frequency ( fig.[fig : direxfielddep](a ) ) .",
    "thus , we observe excitation of the magnetization precession .",
    "oscillatory component in the observed signal can be approximated by the function @xmath91 as can be seen from figs.[fig : direxfielddep](a , b ) the frequency @xmath83 is minimal and the amplitude @xmath92 is maximal at @xmath10=150mt , i.e. when the magnetization becomes parallel to the external field .",
    "this is a conventional behaviour , if the magnetic field is applied along the magnetization hard axis .",
    "we also note that the frequency vs. applied field dependences in the case of strain - induced and direct optical excitation resemble each other ( see figs.[fig : acexprecession](c ) and [ fig : direxfielddep](a ) ) , with some deviation observed at low fields , which could be due to a fact that the measurements were performed at @xmath26=20 and 293k , respectively .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the magnetization right after the direct optical excitation in more detail ( fig.[fig : direxprecession](b ) ) and , in particular , determined the initial phases @xmath93 of precession ( [ eq : sine ] ) .",
    "the initial evolution of the magnetization suggest that @xmath46 demonstrates a step - like jump from its equilibrium orientation upon the optical excitation and remains in this orientation for the time much longer than the precession decay . this is opposite to the case of injected strain pulse @xcite , when the magnetization takes a complex path before the harmonic oscillations start , which reflects the fact that @xmath46 follows the strain while it propagates through the film and returns back to equilibrium orientation once the strain pulse has left the film .",
    "the most striking result is that the initial phase @xmath93 of the oscillations possesses non - monotonous field dependence .",
    "in particular @xmath94 demonstrates pure @xmath95like behaviour when the magnetic field is of @xmath10=150mt , and pure @xmath96like behavior at @xmath10=500mt .",

    "one concludes that the _ sine_-like ( @xmath98 ) temporal evolution of @xmath90 at the applied field of @xmath10=150mt corresponds to the magnetization precessing around the transient effective field @xmath99 , which lies in the sample plane .",

    "heat - induced one , based on the rapid increase of the temperature and decrease of the mca constants is expected to trigger the precession at relatively low fields .",
    "the strain - induced one , in turn , can be efficient at high fields as well , as was demonstrated in experiments with purely acoustic excitation of the studied film ( sec.[sec : expac ] ) .    in order to test this model we calculated the changes of the mca parameters @xmath45 and the magneto - elastic part of the free energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) of the optically - excited ( fe , ga ) film , using the routine described briefly in secs.[sec : theorymag ] and [ sec : theoryac ] and in more detail in @xcite . since some required parameters are unknown for galfenol , for calculations we used those of fe : @xmath105=672jm@xmath106k@xmath107 @xcite , @xmath108=3.8@xmath109j / m@xmath106k@xmath13 , @xmath57=80.4 wm@xmath13k@xmath13 @xcite . the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath58=8@xmath1210@xmath110 wm@xmath106k@xmath13 was obtained from @xcite where the electron - phonon relaxation time equal to @xmath111 was found to be of 250fs .",

    "fig.[fig : direxfielddep](d ) shows calculated equilibrium in - plane orientation of the effective field @xmath102 , confirming that it aligns with the external field when the latter exceeds @xmath10=150mt , in agreement with the squid data ( not shown ) .",
    "the calculations of the laser - induced magnetization dynamics were performed for the optical excitation density of @xmath84=10mj@xmath12@xmath85 . for this laser fluence the lattice temperature increase calculated with eq.([eq : templ ] ) was found to be of @xmath115=120k .",
    "corresponding change of the mca parameters was found to be of @xmath116=-4.75mt and @xmath117=-2.2mt , and the persistent components of the compressive and shear dynamical strain were found to be @xmath118=1.2@xmath119 and @xmath120=-4@xmath121 . from these values the optically - triggered out - of - plane @xmath103 and in - plane @xmath104 deviations of the effective field @xmath122 ( fig.[fig : exp](a ) ) were found , as shown in fig.[fig : direxfielddep](e ) .",
    "one can see that , as expected , the heat - induced change of the mca affects the orientation of the effective field predominantly in the range of the applied fields below and close to @xmath10=150mt .",
    "by contrast , the strain - induced deviation of the effective field remains significant even when the applied field is as high as 500mt . at lower fields this contribution competes with the heat - induced one .",
    "the calculations also confirm that the propagating strain pulses also generated by the optical excitation contribute much weakly to the mca change .",
    "importantly , at high fields optically - generated strain results in the out - of - plane deviation @xmath103 of @xmath102 . at intermediate and low field",
    "the combined effect of the heat- and strain - induced anisotropy change results in both @xmath103 and @xmath104 to be non - zero . at @xmath10=150mt ,",
    "i.e. when equilibrium magnetization is aligned along the external field , the heat - induced change of magnetocrystalline constants dominates and @xmath102 deviates mostly in plane .",
    "these two limiting situations are illustrated in the insets of fig.[fig : direxfielddep](e ) .",
    "finally , the amplitude and the initial phase of the magnetization precession triggered via heat- and strain - induced change of magnetic anisotropy of galfenol film were calculated ( fig.[fig : direxfielddep](b , c ) ) .",
    "good agreement between the experimental data and the calculated one confirms that the mca in the optically - excited ( 311)-(fe , ga ) film is indeed modified and , thus , triggers the precession , via two distinct mechanisms . at relatively low fields the heat - induced change of anisotropy parameters is efficient , as was also shown in a number of previous works @xcite .",
    "in addition , optically - generated strain modifies mca via inverse magnetostriction .",
    "furthermore , as the applied field increases , the heat - induced contribution to the magnetic anisotropy change decreases more rapidly than the strain - induced one . as a result , in the relatively high fields magnetization precession is excited mostly due to the optically - generated persistent strain .",
    "it is instructive to note , that the microscopical mechanism of the mca change is the same when either the step - like strain is induced optically in the magnetic film , or the strain pulse is injected into the film .",
    "however , the magnetization precession trajectories may appear to be very distinct .",
    "in the case of the direct optical excitation the temporal profile of the @xmath46 modified due to abruptly emerged strain can be seen as the step - like jump .",
    "this sets the amplitude and initial phase of the magnetization precession , which are uniquely linked to the angle between the equilibrium and modified directions of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this situation becomes much more intricate when the strain pulse drives the mca change .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , strain pulse alternates the direction of @xmath46 upon propagation through the film triggering the magnetization precession , which then proceeds around the equilibrium @xmath46 ones the strain pulse left the film .",
    "thus , the amplitude and the initial phase of the excited precession would be dependent on the particular spatial and temporal profile of the strain pulse .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated two alternative approaches allowing one to control magnetocrystalline anisotropy of a metallic magnetic film by dynamical strain , with inverse magnetostriction being the mechanism coupling magnetization to strain . using 100-nm film of a ferromagnetic metallic alloy ( fe , ga ) grown on a low symmetry ( 311)-gaas substrate , we were able to trigger the magnetization precession by dynamical strain of a mixed , compressive and shear , character .",
    "picosecond quasi - longitudinal and quasi - transversal strain pulses can be injected into the galfenol film from the substrate , which leads to efficient excitation of the magnetization precession . in this case , owing to the distinct propagation velocities of qla and qta pulses in the substrate , their impact on mca can be easily distinguished and analyzed . importantly",
    ", dynamical strain remains the efficient stimulus triggering the magnetization precession in the applied magnetic fields up to 1.2 t .",
    "alternatively , one can directly excite the galfenol film by a femtosecond laser pulse . in this case",
    "there are two competing mechanism mediating the ultrafast change of mca .",
    "rapid increase of the lattice temperature results in the decrease of the mca parameters .",
    "the lattice temperature increase also sets up the thermal stress which results in optically generated strain .",
    "we demonstrate that the heat - induced decrease of the mca parameters and the change of mca mediated by the inverse magnetostriction compete and both can trigger the magnetization precession . despite the fact that the temporal and the spatial profiles of the lattice temperature increase and optically - generated strain closely resemble each other",
    ", their impact on mca can be distinguished .",
    "this is possible owing to distinct response of magnetization to the heat - induced _ decrease _ of anisotropy parameters and to the strain - induced _ change and reorientation _ of the effective field describing the mca . in the former case",
    "the magnetization precession is triggered only if the external magnetic field applied along the magnetization hard axis is of moderate strength . in the latter case",
    "this constrain is lifted and the precession excitation was observed in the applied fields as strong as at least 0.5 t .",
    "the experiments with strain pulses injected into the film suggest that strain - induced precession excitation would remain efficient at higher applied field values as well .",
    "we would like to emphasise , that in order to realize the strain - induced control of magnetic anisotropy in the optically excited metallic film , low symmetry and elastic anisotropy of the latter is of primary importance . as we have shown in our recent study @xcite in the galfenol film of high symmetry grown on the ( 001 ) gaas substrate magnetic anisotropy change",
    "is dominated by the lattice heating and related decrease of mca parameters .",
    "thus , low - symmetry films and structures , where the dynamical strain can efficiently modify mca at relatively high magnetic fields , may be promising objects , when one aims at the excitation of magnetization precession of high frequency .",
    "finally , we note that direct detection of the optically - generated quasi - persistent strain in a metallic film is a challenging task .",
    "this strain component is intrinsically accompanied by the laser - pulse induced lattice heating .",
    "therefore , detection of this strain component by optical means is naturally obscured by the change of optical properties of the medium @xcite .",
    "realized in our experiments at the high magnetic field limit observation of the magnetization precession around new mca direction , which was set mostly by the emerged quasi - persistent strain , can be considered as an indirect way to probe this constituent of the ultrafast lattice dynamics .",
