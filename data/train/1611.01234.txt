    "an important observational result of the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "@xcite is the discovery that the majority of the detected extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources are identified as blazars , consisting of bl lacertae objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by the large area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ which found that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) occupy a vast fraction of the _ fermi_-detected sources @xcite with 98% of @xmath0-ray agn being identified as blazars @xcite .",
    "a persistent short - timescale variability ( from few hundreds of seconds to days ) of @xmath0-ray flux , especially during a flaring state indicates strongly beamed emission originating from a compact region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the @xmath0-ray emission in blazars is believed to originate in the synchrotron self - compton process where lower - energy photons from a highly relativistic electron population are up - scattered by the same population , and in the external compton process where external seed photons from the accretion disk , broad line region clouds or the torus are up - scattered by the relativistic electron population at the jet base .",
    "their discernible signatures can be inferred by modeling the agn spectral energy distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from other observables such as the relationship between photon energy density and the doppler factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "among the 1591 _ fermi_-detected agn @xcite , thirty - two are non - blazar agn , including two compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , fourteen radio galaxies , five narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and six other type agn .",
    "the css and ghz - peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources constitute a significant fraction of compact radio - loud agn in flux density limited radio surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are characterized by a steep spectrum and compact source size ( css @xmath1015 kpc , and gps @xmath101 kpc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the source 3c 286 is one of two identified unique @xmath0-ray emitting css sources .",
    "the other one is 4c @xmath1139.23b , but its @xmath0-ray source identification is suspicious since the @xmath0-ray emission could arise from the nearby blazar 4c @xmath1139.23",
    ". a detailed study of the jet properties ( kinematics , morphology , doppler boosting factor ) in 3c 286 will be helpful for understanding the physical origin and location of the @xmath0-ray emission from this compact misaligned agn . by misaligned , we refer to low power agns with weakly relativistic jets owing to larger inclination angles towards the observer s line of sight resulting in low doppler boosting , interpreted in terms of the agn orientation based unification scheme ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the quasar 3c  286 ( b1328 + 307 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is identified as a css quasar @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum is constructed with data available from the ned .",
    "the shape indicates a steep radio spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) with a spectral index of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) between 1.4 and 50 ghz with a turnover at about 300 mhz , below which it is flat till @xmath1 75 mhz .",
    "the source is slightly resolved in the 1.7 ghz very large array ( vla ) image , displaying a primary core and a secondary lobe @xmath1 2.6 ( 19.4 kpc ) to the southwest @xcite .",
    "the radio flux density of the source is rather stable during a multi - band radio monitoring study between 1994 and 1999 spanning 5.5 years @xcite .",
    "it is thus often used as a flux density calibrator owing to this high and stable radio flux density , and compact size @xcite . at even higher resolution and higher frequency of 8.4 and 22.5",
    "ghz , the source is resolved into a core ",
    "double - lobe structure with a bright central component and two lobes at 0.7 to the east and at 2.6 to the southwest @xcite , with an observed knotty morphology between the core and southwestern lobe .",
    "in addition , high polarization has been detected in this source at radio wavelengths @xcite , indicating typical properties characterising a css quasar .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) image shows a compact bright nucleus associated with the radio core @xcite .",
    "a secondary fainter optical feature is seen at @xmath1 10 east of the quasar , roughly aligning with the eastern lobe and is likely a lightened star forming region impacted by the expanding ( relic ) radio jet or a distorted nucleus of the merging companion .",
    "similar observations have also been obtained in another well studied css quasar , 3c 48 @xcite .    at pc scales , the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi )",
    "images of 3c  286 display a complex elongated structure with two embedded compact components that can be interpreted as either core  jet or double hot spots @xcite .",
    "the vlbi structure extends toward the southwest to a projected distance of 700 pc ( 94 mas , * ? ? ?",
    "high polarization and a perpendicular magnetic field is detected in the inner 75-mas jet @xcite .",
    "the inner 10 mas region contains two compact components , having comparable flux densities @xcite . from previous studies , it was unclear as to which component was associated with the core from available data , as both components were larger than typical vlbi cores of radio - loud agn , and",

    ". the jet bends at @xmath16  mas away from the brighter component identified as c2 in @xcite , from a position angle p.a . of @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where a changing polarization angle is also indicated @xcite .",
    "the outermost portion of the vlbi jet aligns well with the kpc - scale jet and lobe .    in section [ sec : data ] , the vlbi observations used for the morphology and kinematics studies are summarized and the basic data reduction procedure is reviewed . in section [ sec : results ] , we identify the core by investigating the spectral index and compactness of vlbi components and infer the jet proper motion speed , and discuss the jet morphological characteristics at the pc and kpc scales . in section [ sec : discussion ] ,",
    "the observed vlbi jet properties and possible @xmath0-ray emission mechanism and sites as applicable to 3c 286 are discussed , followed by a summary in section [ sec : summary ] . a standard @xmath17-cold dark matter cosmological model with h@xmath18 = 73 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite",
