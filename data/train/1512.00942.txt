    "ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , that reliable workhorse of plasma physics , has long been cast into noncanonical hamiltonian form @xcite .",
    "so has the theory from which it is usually derived , the two - fluid model @xcite .",
    "there are many advantages to a hamiltonian form : the discovery and classification of invariants ; the development of numerical algorithms that automatically preserve such invariants ; easily finding the equations of motion in curved coordinates ; conducting equilibrium and stability analysis",
    ". however , there are many theories intermediate in complexity between two - fluid theory and ideal mhd ; kimura and morrison @xcite describe eleven of them .",
    "two are particularly important : hall mhd , which accounts for the difference between the motion of the two species in a typical plasma , and lst s extended mhd @xcite , which includes all terms of first order in the ratio @xmath0 of species masses in the derivation from two - fluid electron - ion theory .",
    "recently , yoshida and hameiri @xcite formulated a noncanonical poisson bracket for hall mhd , and shortly later abdelhamid , kawazura and yoshida did so for extended mhd @xcite ; however , as often happens when working with hamiltonian systems , they had to simply posit a bracket and prove it satisfied all the desired attributes , such as antisymmetry and the jacobi identity .",
    "we will show how to derive these brackets , starting from action principles for each theory .",
    "these action principles have a long and distinguished history in fluids , originating with the work of lagrange in the 18th century @xcite .",
    "the action principle formulation has also been employed in plasma physics since the second half of the 20th century , as evident from the works of @xcite . for ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) ,",
    "the first action principle formulation was provided by newcomb in @xcite , shortly followed by other works in the same area @xcite . for extended mhd ,",
    "an eulerian action principle was proposed by @xcite which was subsequently generalized to a eulerian - lagrangian action by @xcite . for recent overviews of action principle formulations of plasma models ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the noncanonical hamiltonian formulations for these models can be found in the works of @xcite .    in principle",
    "there is an easy process to construct a noncanonical poisson bracket , which goes as follows .",
    "first , construct an action whose variations give the correct equations of motion in some coordinate system . from this tangent - space action principle ,",
    "derive a hamiltonian function via a legendre transform , and produce the corresponding phase - space action principle using the canonical momenta of the original action .",
    "the poisson bracket accompanying the phase - space action will be canonical .",
    "then simply change coordinates in order to produce the desired noncanonical bracket .",
    "this procedure is , indeed , what we use , but there are many complications along the way .",
    "to begin with , the canonical bracket for fluid theories requires lagrangian coordinates : those in which every fluid element is given a distinct label , and the equations of motion are expressed for a given labelled element , despite the fact that the element is changing position .",
    "however , fully lagrangian actions for hall and extended mhd have not yet been given .",
    "the closest are the mixed lagrangian - eulerian actions of ref .",
    "@xcite , `` eulerian '' coordinates being ones that observe fluid quantities at a fixed point rather than following a given element . in this paper",
    "we present fully lagrangian actions .",
    "another complication arises because the legendre transform fails to be invertible for either theory , and an expression for one of the velocities in terms of the phase - space variables must be inserted by hand .",
    "finally , the euler - lagrange map producing the noncanonical brackets requires prior knowledge of the generalized vorticities advected by the theories , so we must devote some time to their discovery and elucidation .",
    "these generalized vorticities turn out to be crucial to the structure of every hamiltonian mhd model .",
    "there are @xmath1 advected vorticities for a theory with @xmath1 distinct charged species , @xmath1 being two in our case .",
    "`` advected '' in this case means that the flux elements defined by the vorticities are carried along with the fluid , their corresponding two - forms obeying a lie - dragging equation . for ideal mhd",
    ", both generalized vorticities collapse down to the same quantity , the magnetic field , which is advected by the fluid velocity . for hall mhd ,",
    "one generalized vorticity is the magnetic field , whose fluxes are carried along with the electron velocity , and the other is the magnetic field plus kinetic vorticity @xmath2 , advected by the ion velocity @xcite . for",
    "extended mhd they turn out to be almost the same , but differing from the hall mhd ones by terms of order @xmath0 in the curl of the current .",
    "both our actions and our derivations of noncanonical brackets would be impossible , but for the fact that we can eliminate the eulerian magnetic field terms in both the action and the euler - lagrange map in favor of fully lagrangian terms , an elimination wholly dependent on the existence of these advected fluxes .    before moving on , we note a few ways in which our present work can be readily extended along the lines of past works that utilized these methods .",
    "one can incorporate finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects , such as the braginskii gyroviscosity @xcite .",
    "flr effects for reduced mhd @xcite and generalized fluid models @xcite were implemented via an action principle formulation , and evidently a similar treatment can be undertaken via our extended mhd action principles .",
    "further extensions include stability analyses @xcite , the systematic derivation of reduced extended mhd models ( with potential applications in collisionless reconnection ) , linear and nonlinear waves via a lagrangian approach @xcite , and mhd - like models ( ideal , hall , or extended ) for quasineutral plasmas with more than two charged species .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ subsec : hamsys ] reviews the basic framework of hamiltonian systems , while section [ subsec : hammhd ] presents a specific example of that framework for ideal mhd , allowing comparisons with the related , but more complex constructions for hall and extended mhd .",
    "we begin our new material by focusing on the simpler theory , hall mhd , in section [ sec : hallmhd ] .",
    "section [ subsec : hallflux ] lays out the needed terminology and facts about hall mhd , which are then used in section [ subsec : hallactions ] to construct both tangent - space and phase - space actions .",
    "section [ subsec : hallliegauge ] is an interesting digression in which we lay out a useful gauge , producing not only advected fluxes but corresponding advected one - forms .",
    "finally , we reach the goal which motivates our entire paper , the derivation in section [ subsec : hallelmap ] of the noncanonical bracket . this derivation is carried out in more algebraic detail than might be necessary , in light of its unfamiliarity to many readers .",
    "we then pivot to extended mhd in section [ sec : exmhd ] , starting with a derivation of its fluxes in section [ subsec : exmhdflux ] .",
    "we give its actions in section [ subsec : exmhdaction ] , and derive its noncanonical bracket in section [ subsec : exmhdelmap ] .",
    "this derivation takes more work than that in [ subsec : hallelmap ] , but the procedure is identical , so this time we omit the details .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as mentioned , all four models have been put into hamiltonian form . by",
    "that we mean that there is a functional @xmath3 and a bracket @xmath4 so that the time derivative of an arbitrary functional is given by @xmath5 the functionals are integral expressions of the field variables ; for instance , the hamiltonian functional is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an energy density . to separate out the time evolution of the field variables ( like a momentum @xmath8 )",
    ", one can use a test functional such as @xmath9    the bracket can be expressed as @xmath10 where the @xmath11 denotes functional differentiation and the components of @xmath12 represent the field variables .",
    "the differential operators @xmath13 must be chosen so that the bracket satisfies its usual properties ( here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are functionals , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real numbers ) : @xmath19 of these , only the last , the jacobi identity , proves difficult to confirm .",
    "thankfully , the method of this paper provides a relatively easy way to confirm it . in lagrangian coordinates , where every fluid element is given a distinct label @xmath20 and the equations of motion are evaluated at fixed label ( i.e. for a given fluid element ) , the bracket will be canonical : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate at fixed label @xmath20 , and @xmath23 is its conjugate momentum , which can be obtained via an action .",
    "this paper has such actions for each of its models .",
    "the jacobi identity is fairly easy to prove for the canonical bracket , relying only on the commutation of functional derivatives , @xmath24 .",
    "however , the map converting lagrangian to eulerian coordinates , in which equations are expressed at fixed spatial coordinates , produces a noncanonical bracket ; for example , even the straightforward definition @xmath25 gives an eulerian momentum dependent on both lagrangian position and momentum .",
    "the jacobi identity can be directly proven for the eulerian bracket , as was done in @xcite for relativistic mhd and @xcite for hall mhd . however , when such a bracket is produced from the canonical lagrangian one , the jacobi identity is assured , as it is invariant under coordinate changes and reductions .      in this section",
    "we exhibit the already - discovered hamiltonian forms for ordinary , hall and extended mhd .",
    "it will be our goal in secs .",
    "[ sec : hallmhd ] and [ sec : exmhd ] to derive the latter two .",
    "these theories are all expressed here in terms of eulerian variables , and lagrangian equivalents will be postponed until our later discussion of their actions , where they occur more naturally .    in mhd",
    "the eulerian field variables are density @xmath26 , specific entropy @xmath27 , fluid velocity @xmath28 and magnetic field @xmath29 . in the barotropic case",
    ", one can express @xmath27 as a function of @xmath26 and thereby eliminate it , but we consider the more general case .",
    "one can also use as a supplementary variable the current density @xmath30 , using ampre s law in the absence of displacement current .",
    "particle number and entropy are conserved and advected , respectively : @xmath31 the fluid velocity obeys the following momentum equation : @xmath32 while the magnetic field s evolution is determined by ohm s law for a perfect conductor : @xmath33 as can be seen by taking its curl and applying faraday s law : @xmath34    in hamiltonian mhd , while one can express the hamiltonian and bracket in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath27 ( along with @xmath29 and @xmath26 ) , their derivation turns out to be simpler when using the momentum density @xmath35 and the entropy density @xmath36 . in terms of these variables",
    "the hamiltonian is the total energy @xmath37 and the bracket is @xmath38 this bracket also constitutes the bulk of the hall and extended mhd brackets .",
    "it was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the sign convention used is from that paper .",
    "hall mhd differs from ordinary mhd in that the difference between ion and electron velocities is no longer neglected in ohm s law .",
    "the derivation then modifies that law to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number density , @xmath41 is the particle mass ( here equal to the ion mass ) and @xmath42 is the electron pressure . the entropy , continuity , and momentum equations are unchanged , as is the hamiltonian .",
    "the bracket , in turn , now has the additional term : @xmath43 this bracket was first described by @xcite , and it requires the assumption of a barotropic electron pressure .",
    "later we will see that this assumption gives us an advected magnetic flux , while barotropic ion pressure gives a second advected quantity .",
    "these will be a necessary part of our construction of the bracket .    in extended mhd ,",
    "one additionally retains terms of first order in @xmath44 during the derivation , producing a new momentum equation : @xmath45 and a new version of ohm s law : @xmath46 here the term @xmath47 refers to the symmetric tensorial outer product .    the bracket and hamiltonian , however , are more compactly expressed in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "the hamiltonian , which now includes a term for the electron kinetic energy , is @xmath49 in light of the mhd ampre s law @xmath50 .",
    "its bracket , in turn , is @xmath51 this bracket was first given in ref .",
    "it also requires barotropic electron pressure @xmath52 . the structural similarity between the hall and extended mhd poisson brackets",
    "was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will be elucidated further below .",
    "the essential difference between the various mhd models lies in their flux conservation laws , each one having a different version .",
    "the archetypal flux conservation law is that of ordinary mhd , @xmath53 @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath20 variables are coordinates in a label space @xmath54 , whose continuous values identify fluid elements at @xmath55 ( this condition can be relaxed , as in @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the coordinates @xmath56 describe the point to which a specific element flows ; thus , @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , @xmath58 while @xmath59 .",
    "more explicitly , we write the flux conservation law as @xmath60 this expression can be manipulated into a transformation rule for the magnetic field : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the jacobian determinant of the invertible transformation from @xmath20 to @xmath63 .    , while the magnetic flux is dragged to @xmath64 .",
    "their difference is @xmath65 . ]",
    "there are two distinct ways one can modify the flux conservation law .",
    "first , one can advect a flux different from that of @xmath29 ; with an appropriate choice of this flux , one then gets 2d inertial mhd @xcite .",
    "second , the same flux can be advected , but along a path distinct from that of the fluid .",
    "this second approach gives hall mhd .",
    "specifically , while the fluid itself flows from @xmath20 to a point @xmath56 , the flux element moves from @xmath20 to a distinct point @xmath64 , as illustrated by figure [ labelspacefigure1 ] .",
    "flux conservation is now @xmath66 which gives rise to the transformation rule @xmath67 the flux jacobian @xmath68 is also invertible , and can be written @xmath69 from which one can derive the expression @xmath70 .",
    "taking a full time derivative of @xmath71 in equation gives @xmath72 this equation shows that @xmath29 is advected along @xmath73 as the vector dual to a 2-form , as desired . since @xmath29 is divergenceless , we can add a term proportional to @xmath74 and put the equation in the more familiar faraday form @xmath75    so far , so good .",
    "however , complications arise when you look for the other equations of motion .",
    "some fluid attributes ( density , specific entropy ) are transported along the flow lines @xmath63 , not @xmath73 : mass conservation is described by @xmath76 , and entropy conservation by @xmath77 , recalling that no dissipative terms have been added . as a result",
    ", the label corresponding to the magnetic field will differ from the label on the other quantities .",
    "this situation is shown in figure [ labelspacefigure2 ] .    , where a flux has also flowed from a different initial point @xmath78 ; thus @xmath79 . ]    in this figure , the fluid element labelled by @xmath20 flows to @xmath56 , while a different label @xmath78 shows the origin of the flux element that has been advected to @xmath80 .    for future use",
    "we will need two additional quantities : the point @xmath81 , to which the @xmath78 element flows , and the difference @xmath82 between @xmath83 and @xmath81 .",
    "all these quantities are related via @xmath84 more relations are available , for example @xmath85 . in principle",
    "we could eliminate all but two of the quantities , but it is simpler to keep the extras around .",
    "we also note that , for hall mhd , @xmath63 corresponds to ion flow and @xmath73 to electron flow , so they might also have been written @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; however , in extended mhd , we will use similar quantities , but they will now differ slightly from the electron and ion paths .",
    "thus we use a convention that will be appropriate for both models .",
    "we will also adopt the convention of using superscripts to show vectorial indices , and subscripts to show other attributes , like species identity or initial condition .",
    "there are cases where the distinction between vectors and covectors ( and thus raised and lowered indices ) matters , such as when using curved coordinates , but it may easily be reinstated when needed .",
    "we have , however , left the distinction intact in the expressions @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where it improves readability .",
    "every point corresponds to two labels . in hall mhd , using the convention described above , unprimed labels will denote ion quantities : for example , the number density is advected along the fluid lines , which in our approximation are the ion flow lines",
    ". meanwhile , primed labels will denote electron quantities , such as the magnetic flux density advected along electron flow lines . in light of fig . 2 above",
    ", the variable @xmath63 will appear as both @xmath56 and @xmath81 , as will some quantities ( namely the potentials @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) dependent on them . to simplify expressions",
    "we will write @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with unprimed expressions such as @xmath63 denoting unprimed quantities like @xmath56 .    if we treat primed and unprimed quantities separately , then the full euler - lagrange equations , using lagrangian density @xmath96",
    ", will be @xmath97_{a ' = q_f^{-1}(q(a , t),t ) } & = 0 \\ ; .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a similar expression for @xmath98 .",
    "many of the terms in the euler - lagrange equations are superfluous : only the first four terms will contribute in the @xmath63 variation , and only the second and fourth terms in the @xmath98 one .",
    "these euler - lagrange equations can be obtained via dirac delta function manipulations on a six - dimensional label space : @xmath99 but for the most part , we will omit this consideration and work with .",
    "however , we emphasize one peculiarity of the action : it only works if the delta function integral is performed after the variations .",
    "if one does so before varying , collapsing back down to a single label space , the variational principle no longer gives the correct expressions .",
    "this peculiarity is shared by the mixed lagrangian - eulerian approach of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if it were written in terms of ion and electron velocities @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the lagrangian density would be standard : @xmath100 in hall mhd , we treat electron velocity as being different from ion velocity ( unlike in regular mhd ) , but nonetheless neglect terms of order @xmath101",

    "the three final terms come from the full derivative @xmath121 , and the pressure term comes from the @xmath122 dependence of @xmath68 : @xmath123 with the whole thing evaluated at @xmath124 as usual .",
    "reordering and simplifying , one finds @xmath125 which is ohm s law for hall mhd .",
    "finally , the canonical momenta are @xmath126 with the lagrangian function @xmath127 defined by @xmath128 .",
    "the expression for @xmath129 will allow us to convert the thus - far omitted field term @xmath130 into a term expressed by fluid quantities , once we switch to a phase - space action .",
    "it turns out to be easy to translate the mixed eulerian - lagrangian terms of ref . @xcite into the appropriate terms of , when one minds the difference between primed and unprimed labels .",

    "we also can not perform the usual legendre transform , because we have no expression @xmath139 .",
    "fortunately , we can solve these problems by switching to a phase space action and invoking .",

    "once again , most of the terms vanish in the @xmath63 variation .",
    "the @xmath148 terms in the middle term of give two factors of @xmath149 , and the @xmath68 in the same term gives a factor of @xmath150 .",
