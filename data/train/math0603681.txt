    "we consider the system shown in figure [ tms ] consisting of two masses interconnected by a spring , a typical control benchmark problem which is a generic model of a system with a rigid body mode and one vibration mode @xcite .",
    "if the first mass is pulled sufficiently far apart from the second mass and suddenly dropped , then the two masses will oscillate until they reach their equilibrium position .    ]    the control problem we study in this note consists of appropriately moving the second mass so that the first mass settles down to its final position as fast as possible ; more specifically , we want to maximize the asymptotic decay rate .",
    "for this we use a linear feedback controller between the system output ( measured position of the second mass ) and the system input ( actuator positioning the first mass ) .",
    "this control problem can be formulated as the minimization of the abscissa ( maximum of the real parts of the roots ) of a polynomial in the complex laplace indeterminate , whose coefficients depend affinely on the controller parameters .",
    "this polynomial is the denominator of the closed - loop system transfer function .    for notational simplicity ,",
    "we assume here that both mass weights and the spring constant are normalized to one .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the polynomial is then given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the denominator and numerator polynomial of the controller transfer function to be determined .",
    "this transfer function is assumed to be proper , i.e. , @xmath3 the integer @xmath4 is called the order of the controller . without loss of generality , we take @xmath1 to be monic . letting @xmath5 denote the linear space of polynomials with complex is most naturally stated in this context . ] coefficients and degree @xmath6 , we therefore write @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    for a given polynomial @xmath9",
    ", we define the abscissa of @xmath10 by @xmath11 since the roots of @xmath12 are the closed - loop system poles , the closed - loop two - mass - spring system is stable if and only if @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in maximizing the asymptotic decay rate of the system , i.e. , solving the optimization problem @xmath14    section [ first ] shows that for order @xmath15 , there is no stabilizing controller , i.e. , no @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "section [ third ] shows that when @xmath18 , the abscissa @xmath19 is unbounded below .",
    "section [ second ] studies the more interesting case @xmath20 , and gives a formula for @xmath16 that , in section [ locopt ] , we prove is a strong local minimizer of @xmath19 .",
    "section [ timefrag ] plots the time response of the optimized controller and discusses the issue of robustness .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "if we assume that the controller has order @xmath21 , then both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are first degree polynomials , say @xmath22 with @xmath23 this polynomial is stable , i.e. , it has all its roots in the open left half - plane , if and only if all the principal minors of its hurwitz matrix @xmath24\\ ] ] are all strictly positive , see e.g. @xcite",
    ". this can never be the case since the 2-by-2 northwest minor has rank one for all @xmath25 .",
    "hence a controller of first order ( or less ) can not stabilize the two - mass - spring system .",
    "note that in problem ( [ minabs ] ) the minimum abscissa @xmath26 is attained for any static controller @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 $ ] , because then @xmath30 has only imaginary roots .",

    "if we seek a controller of order @xmath36 then we can write @xmath37 by identifying powers of the indeterminate @xmath38 , we derive the linear system of equation @xmath39   \\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_0\\\\x_1\\\\x_2\\\\y_0\\\\y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\end{array}\\right ] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}p_0\\\\p_1\\\\p_2\\\\p_3\\\\p_4\\\\p_5 - 2\\\\p_6 \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] this 7-by-7 matrix is called the sylvester matrix of polynomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and it is non - singular because these two polynomials share no common roots . in other words , we can find controller coefficients defining any desired closed - loop polynomial .",
    "this is what dorato @xcite calls the fundamental theorem of feedback control , namely the fact that the poles of a single - input - single - output linear system of order @xmath42 can be placed arbitrarily by a linear controller of order @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , an arbitrarily large negative abscissa can be achieved in closed - loop by a controller of order three ( or more ) .",
    "for example , by solving the linear system of equations shown above , we obtain that the controller polynomials @xmath44 place all the closed - loop poles at an arbitrary real value @xmath45 .",
    "it follows that problem ( [ minabs ] ) is not bounded below for @xmath18 .",
    "in the case of a controller of order @xmath20 , we have @xmath46 we can cluster all the closed - loop poles at a real negative value @xmath45 by solving the following system of equations @xmath47 we observe that the only constraint on @xmath45 is enforced by the fourth and sixth equations , namely @xmath48 we rule out the case @xmath49 since the closed - loop system would be only marginally stable , and we extract the negative solution @xmath50 the controller coefficients can now be derived by substitution , resulting in @xmath51 yielding @xmath52 we should note that we realized that all roots could be clustered at a single point @xmath53 after performing numerical experiments using hifoo ( * ? ? ?",

    "in this section we prove that @xmath54 is , at least locally , the minimal abscissa that can be achieved with a second - order controller , i.e. , a local minimizer of problem ( [ minabs ] ) for @xmath20 .",
    "this is nontrivial , since one might think it is necessary to consider all possible splittings of the multiple root under perturbation .",
    "we prove local optimality using recent advances in nonsmooth analysis .",

    "clearly , minimizing the abscissa of the polynomial ( [ newpoly ] ) over @xmath68 \\in { \\mathbb{c}}^5 $ ] is equivalent to the original problem ( [ minabs ] ) . because the space of monic polynomials is not a linear space ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath69 for the abscissa of @xmath70 .",

    "in order to do this we can use the nonsmooth chain rule ( * ? ? ? * lemma 4.4 ) @xmath84 as long as we verify the constraint qualification @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes null space and @xmath87 denotes the horizon subdifferential operator @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "this chain rule is valid because of the _ subdifferential regularity _",
    "8) of the function @xmath72 on @xmath5 , established in @xcite .",

    "thus the nonsmooth chain rule ( [ chainrule ] ) yields @xmath94 the final step is to determine whether @xmath71 is in the interior of this subdifferential set . to check this",
    ", we need to solve the following linear system : set the right - hand side of ( [ astar ] ) to 0 as well as @xmath95 , which reduces to @xmath92       \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } c_3 \\\\",

    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "in figure [ step6 ] we graph the step response of the two mass - spring system fed back with controller ( [ xystar ] ) , obtained with the following matlab @xcite commands :    .... p = tf(1,[1 0 2 0 0 ] ) ; k = tf([-43/5 54*sqrt(15)/125 27/125],[1 6*sqrt(15)/5 7 ] ) ; t = feedback(p , k ) ; step(t ) ; ....    we can see that the settling time is around 16 seconds .    ]",
    "it is well known that multiple roots of polynomials are very sensitive to perturbations in the coefficients . in practice",
    ", this means that the closed - loop system will be fragile , or non - robust , with respect to uncertain data , implementation errors , or even rounding errors .",
    "for example , if instead of implementing the exact second - order controller ( [ xystar ] ) , we implement the nearby controller , obtained by keeping 5 significant digits , given by @xmath98 then we obtain closed - loop poles at @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , quite far from the single pole at @xmath103 assigned with the exact controller .    this phemonenon can be studied graphically . in figure [ rps6 ]",
    "we show , in the gray region , all possible roots of polynomials that can be obtained by real perturbations to the polynomial @xmath104 given in ( [ pxystar ] ) , where the norm of the vector of perturbations to the coefficients is no more than @xmath105 .",
    "this region is sometimes called the real pseudozero set .     under real perturbations to its coefficients with norm @xmath106.[rps6 ] ]",
    "in this note we have formulated the problem of maximizing the closed - loop asymptotic decay rate of a linear control system as a nonsmooth , nonconvex problem of polynomial abscissa minimization , focusing on the case of a benchmark two - mass - spring system .",
    "we derived a formula for a second - order controller with closed - loop poles clustered at a single point .",
    "our main contribution is the use of recently developed techniques from nonsmooth variational analysis to prove local optimality of this controller .",
    "motivated by this result , as well as the result in @xcite on which it is based , very recent work @xcite using a completely different technique shows that the second - order controller described above is actually globally optimal .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that asymptotic decay rate maximization is not , by itself , a practical objective . as shown graphically in figure [ rps6 ] , our locally optimal controller yields a closed - loop system which is sensitive to uncertainty and/or disturbance . in other words ,",
    "lack of robustness is the price one has to pay to maximize the decay rate . in a typical control engineering system",
