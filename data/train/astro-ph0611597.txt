    "high - energy neutrino astrophysics is entering the era of kilometer - scale observatories .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope will be the first detector with an integrated exposure volume to reach @xmath1{km^3\\cdot yr}$ ] .",
    "the detector includes a deep array of digital optical sensors deployed at depths between and in holes drilled in the glacial ice sheet at the geographic south pole .",
    "these deep sensor modules detect the cherenkov light radiated by passing charged relativistic particles in transit through the ice medium .",
    "the optical properties of this medium have been measured with _ in situ _ light sources @xcite deployed with the predecessor detector array , amanda @xcite : below the ice becomes bubble free where long absorption and scattering lengths are found ( @xmath3{m}$ ] , @xmath4{m}$ ] ) .",
    "the icecube deep array is optimized for the detection of muons produced by high energy ( @xmath5{tev}$ ] ) neutrinos from astrophysical point source emitters such as active galactic nuclei or transient sources such as gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the muon is produced via charged - current interactions of the neutrino with ice nuclei ( @xmath6 ) , typically exterior to the detector volume due to the long range of muons with energies in excess of .",
    "ice is also an ideal calorimetric medium due to the long optical absorption lengths and so the visible energy of contained neutrino events can be reconstructed with @xmath7% resolution in the exponent .",
    "in addition to these high - energy phenomena of cosmic origin , icecube may observe signals from dark matter annihilations and will collect a high statistics sample ( @xmath8 ) of atmospheric neutrinos relevant to particle physics topics such as lorenz invariance tests in regions unreachable by other techniques . at the low energy end , icecube presents an effective volume of approximately @xmath9{tons}$ ] to mev neutrinos from supernovae .",
    "an array of the same sensors deployed in the ice holes are frozen into tanks at the top of each hole , providing an airshower detector component for icecube .",
    "called icetop , this instrumentation may be used as a trigger veto to assist in rejection of cosmic ray event backgrounds in the deep detector .",
    "furthermore , combining its data with data from the deep - ice array provides a unique opportunity to study cosmic ray composition in the region of the `` knee , '' extending earlier measurements performed using the combination of the spase and amanda detectors @xcite .",
    "the icecube detector currently under construction at the south pole , will consist of up to 4800 digital optical modules ( doms ) covering a fiducial volume of 1 cubic km @xcite .",
    "the doms will be equally spaced on up to 80 strings , at depth from  1.5 to  2.5 km in the deep , clear antarctic ice .",
    "an array of surface stations , icetop , enhance the ability to trigger on , or veto , down - going showers .",
    "each icetop station consisted of two clear ice tanks , each instrumented with 2 doms .",
    "an icetop station is located roughly 10 meters from each bore hole of the in - ice array .",
    "icecube is designed to detect cherenkov radiation photons emitted by charged particles .",
    "the particles that are most likely to penetrate through the 1.5 km of ice on top of the detector are muons ( from interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere ) , and neutrinos ( atmospheric or from any other source ) .",
    "the rate of the muon background is about 6 orders of magnitude larger than that of atmospheric neutrinos , and therefore neutrino searches are performed using up - going particles that traverse the entire earth , using the matter of our planet as a muon screen .",
    "based on measurements of the number of photons arriving at different doms and their arrival times , a track or a cascade can be reconstructed .",
    "each dom is an autonomous data collecting and analyzing unit consisting of a 10 `` hamamatsu pmt in a 12 '' pressure sphere ( see figure [ dom ] ) .",
    "a main board inside the dom can digitize up to 300 mega samples per second ( msps ) for 400 ns and 40 msps for @xmath29 .",
    "a flasher board , populated with 12 light emitting diodes ( leds ) , produces pulses used for optical and timing calibration .",
    "the doms can operate in a local coincidence mode , where a data recording will be triggered only if its neighbors were triggered within a certain time window .",
    "the main scientific goal of icecube is to map the neutrino sky @xcite .",
    "icecube will also look for high energy gzk neutrinos @xcite , study air showers , high energy atmospheric neutrinos @xcite and look for supernovas in a special data acquisition mode @xcite .",
    "icecube measurements can be used , to some extent , also for neutrino mass hierarchy and cp phase measurements @xcite .",
    "there are models predicting certain neutrino flux enhancements , which could be measured by icecube .",
    "these sources include , but are not limited to , dark matter , super - symmetry , magnetic monopoles , quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "current theories on cosmic particle acceleration predict that neutrinos and gamma rays are among the by - products of pp and p@xmath35 interactions in sources such as agn ( active galactic nuclei ) or grbs ( gamma ray bursts ) .",
    "many extraterrestrial tev gamma ray sources have already been identified by other experiments , but the missing link is the detection of an extraterrestrial neutrino flux .",
    "this search was optimized to look for extraterrestrial neutrinos with a spectrum , the most general prediction from first order fermi acceleration models .    a diffuse search for neutrinos does not use specific time or location information . instead",
    ", it looks for an excess of events over a large sky region over a long period of time . if the neutrino flux from an individual source is too small to be detected by current means , it is possible that many similar sources , isotropically distributed throughout the universe , would combine to make a detectable signal .",
    "an excess of events over the expected atmospheric neutrino background would be indicative of an extraterrestrial neutrino flux .",
    "the first icecube string ( # 21 ) and the first four icetop stations ( # 21 , # 29 , # 30 , and # 39 ) were deployed in january 2005 at the end of the deployment season and were operated during the austral winter of that year .",
    "the survivability of the digital optical modules during deployment and subsequent refreeze of the drill hole was established ( all doms deployed during this season continue to function properly ) , useful performance data were gathered throughout the year of operation of the string @xcite , and neutrino candidate events were selected from this data run .        during the following austral summer season",
    ", from december 2005 to january 2006 , eight more strings ( # 29 , # 30 , # 38 , # 39 , # 40 , # 49 , # 50 , and # 59 ) and twelve more icetop stations ( # 38 , # 40 , # 47 , # 48 , # 49 , # 50 , # 57 , # 58 , # 59 , # 66 , # 67 , and # 74 ) were deployed bringing the count to 9 strings and 16 surface stations and a total enclosed ice volume of @xmath10{km^3}$ ] .",
    "of the 604 sensors deployed to date , 597 of them communicate and 592 are producing high quality data .",
    "a current view of the icecube detector installation is shown in figure  [ fig : ic3-plan ] .",
    "the deployment plan calls for 12 - 14 strings and 10 surface stations to be deployed this year ( 2006 - 2007 ) to be followed by an average of 14 strings and icetop stations in the following years until 2011 when the full complement of instrumentation will have been deployed , approximately 70 - 75 strings ( 60 doms per string ) and 80 surface stations ( 4 doms per station ) .",
    "icecube will be operated throughout the construction , achieving an integrated exposure of @xmath1{km^3 \\cdot yr}$ ] by 2009 and @xmath11{km^3 \\cdot yr}$ ] by the second year of operation with the completed detector .",
    "we anticipate that the total operating lifetime of the experiment will be 20 years .",
    "the enhanced hot water drill ( ehwd ) system delivers @xmath12{km } \\times \\unit[60]{cm}$ ] holes to the deployment team for insertion of the optical sensor hardware .",
    "the system includes self - contained heating and electrical powerplants with a combined power of approximately , pumping systems , a control facility , and drilling towers .",
    "each year the drill camp is moved into place near the target holes .",
    "the towers then operate as mobile field facilities served by the central drill camp and towed into position atop each drill hole ( figure  [ fig : drillcamp ] ) . during operation , the drill supplies 200 gallons per minute of @xmath13{{^\\circ{c}}}$ ] water at .",
    "the average fuel consumed per hole is 7200 gallons .",
    "the entire operation of drilling a hole and deploying the optical module instrumentation takes approximately 50 hours .",
    "the icecube digital optical module ( dom ) ( figure  [ fig : dom ] ) is the central detector element used throughout the array , both in the deep ice and at the surface .",
    "it is a self - contained optical detector and data acquisition device .",
    "the analog optical device is a 10  photomultiplier tube running at @xmath14 gain into a @xmath15{\\omega}$ ] front - end load impedance .",
    "pmt high voltage bias is supplied internally by a dc - dc converter module that is powered from the line on the dom mainboard and can produce a programmable hv from 0 to .",
    "a classical resistive divider bleeder distributes voltages to the pmt dynodes .",
    "the dom also contains a pcb containing 12 leds which may be flashed in the ice to provide a known optical source for studying ice properties or performing geometrical calibrations of the sensor array .",
    "all components are housed inside a 0.5  thick glass pressure sphere rated to external pressure .",
    "the power and digital communication lines exit the dom via the penetrator cable which attaches to the main communication cable bundles .",
    "dom digital communication signals travel to the surface over copper quads contained within the cable bundles .",
    "doms are assembled at three production and test facilities worldwide within the icecube collaboration : university of wisconsin , stockholm university / uppsala university , and desy zeuthen .",
    "following assembly each dom undergoes a 2 - 3 week test at various temperatures from @xmath16{{^\\circ{c}}}$ ] to @xmath17{{^\\circ{c}}}$ ] in order to evaluate its performance at low temperature and to characterize various optical and electronic operational parameters @xcite .",
    "all data thus far obtained with doms manufactured at all sites supports the claim that all sites are producing equivalent sensor hardware . to date 2000 of a total 5000 doms",
    "have been built .",
    "first pass yields are nearing 90% and the shipping yields are in excess of 95% .",
    "the pmt pulses are converted into digital waveforms by one or more digitizer chips at speeds up to @xmath18 samples / s .",
    "each dom runs in self - triggered mode with the option to monitor digital trigger lines connected to its neighbor doms which it may use to influence the trigger decision .",
    "dom - level triggers force a digitization and readout of the digitizers into local memory on the dom ( the dom has a capacity of 16 mb ) and each readout is time stamped with a counter value derived from the 40 mhz local dom oscillator . upon command from a surface controller , the dom will transfer the contents of its memory buffers to the surface at a bit rate of 1 mbit / s per copper pair .    at the surface , doms are readout by specialized pci cards plugged into industrial pcs running linux .",
    "software running inside these computers must translate the dom timestamp to a global quantity since each dom oscillator is free running .",
    "therefore the time stamp generated in the dom is only locally relevant .",
    "the time transformation is achieved by a process called rapcal wherein the dom and the surface digital communication hardware periodically ( approximately once per second ) exchange analog pulses and stamp the arrival and departure times .",
    "this information is used to establish the dom clock to surface clock mapping .",
    "the clocks at the surface are driven from a single 10 mhz master clock signal synchronized to gps .",
    "measurements in the laboratory and _ in situ _ at south pole demonstrate that dom - to - dom time jitter is @xmath19{ns})$ ] less than the design specification of .",
    "once the digitized pmt pulses have been stamped with a global time , they are merged and sorted into a stream which is sent over ethernet to a cluster of trigger and event processor computers .",
    "the triggering and event packaging is accomplished entirely in application software . during the 2006 run",
    ", two triggers were implemented : a minimum bias trigger ( mbt ) generating an event trigger every @xmath20-th hit for system debugging and the main trigger for physics analysis , the simple majority trigger ( smt ) , requiring coincidence of 8 or more doms hit in the deep - ice array or 6 or more hits in the icetop array within a time window of @xmath21{\\mu{s}}$ ] .",
    "the triggers were formed in separate trigger processors for the in - ice and icetop arrays ; coincident triggers were then handled by a global trigger unit .",

    "once the optimum selection criteria were found , the data were unblinded . however , no event was found correlated with the burst . therefore , upper limits were set , based on the effective area of the detector . assuming a power law spectrum @xmath22 , the limits on the normalization constant of the flux of gamma - rays and neutrinos are shown in figure  [ plots ] ( right ) , as a function of the spectral index .",
    "this means , for instance , limits of 0.05 ( 0.5 ) tev@xmath23  m@xmath24  s@xmath23 for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in the gamma flux and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) tev@xmath23 m@xmath24 s@xmath23 for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in the high - energy neutrino flux ( at 90% cl ) .",
    "six data events were observed on an average predicted atmospheric neutrino background of 6.1 events . since no excess of events",

    "a set of measurements were performed to confirm the design goal of the detector and check its performance @xcite . in order to reconstruct and time tracks over the entire array ,",
    "a timing resolution of a few nanoseconds is needed .",
    "the time resolution of each detector unit was estimated in two independent ways . in the first the flasher board",
    "was used . a led on a dom",
    "was flashed and adjacent doms triggered on it .",
    "the time delay between the flashing and the triggering was measured multiple times .",
    "this procedure was repeated for all doms , and the maximum time rms resolution was found to be less than 2ns . a different way to estimate",

    "atmospheric muons and neutrinos created when cosmic rays interact with the earth s atmosphere are the main background to extraterrestrial neutrino - induced events .",
    "atmospheric and extraterrestrial neutrinos can travel from the far side of the earth , interact in the ice or rock near the detector , and induce an upward - moving muon that can be detected .",
    "atmospheric muons , on the other hand , do not have enough energy to travel a long distance through the earth , and hence they can only trigger the detector if they travel downward from the polar surface into the ice .    the first step in the analysis",
    "was to guess an arrival direction for every event @xcite , as shown on the left in figure [ coszenplots ] . using this directional information , all events that were reconstructed in the downgoing direction",
    "were removed .",
    "the earth was used as a filter and the actual search for extraterrestrial neutrinos was only performed on upgoing events .",
    "since the arrival direction of many downgoing atmospheric muons was originally misreconstructed , event quality requirements were introduced .",
    "events were required to have long , smooth tracks of light that had many cherenkov photons arriving close to their expected arrival times .",
    "this helped remove any misreconstructed downgoing events and helped to assure a purely upgoing sample that can be seen on the right in figure [ coszenplots ] .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos from pions and kaons ( ) have a softer energy spectrum than the proposed extraterrestrial neutrino signal ( ) . as a result , these two event classes can be separated best by their energy . at high energy ,",
    "the extraterrestrial neutrino flux would dominate over the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "since the energy of an event is not directly observable , the number of optical modules ( oms ) hit during an event was used as an energy - correlated parameter .",
    "optimization studies performed on the simulation indicated that the best signal - to - background region would be obtained by using events with at least 100 oms triggered .",
    "the number of data events seen in this high energy window was compared to the predicted atmospheric neutrino background , shown in figure [ nchplot ] .",

    "downgoing events that were previously eliminated ( 0@xmath38 < zenith angle <",
    "80@xmath38 ) were reintroduced . with very high statistics available from these downgoing events ,",
    "the characteristics of high energy events were studied without having to reveal the high energy upgoing data events .",
    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the most plausible sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "detection of high energy neutrinos from a burst would provide corroborating evidence for the production of ultra - high energy cosmic rays inside grbs .",
    "it is believed that gamma rays produced by grbs originate from electrons accelerated in internal shock waves associated with relativistic jets ( with lorenz boost @xmath40@xmath39300 ) .",
    "these gamma rays have energies in the range from 10 kev to greater than 10 mev .",
    "the gamma ray spectrum can be described as a broken power law , with a softer spectrum above a break energy which is typically 0.25 - 1 mev .",
    "gamma ray bursts can last anywhere from a few milliseconds up to a few hundred seconds .",
    "the distribution of durations is usually considered to be composed of two separate classes , with short bursts lasting less than 2 seconds and long bursts lasting more than 2 seconds @xcite .",
    "gamma ray bursts are reviewed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the neutrino flavor ratio @xmath43:@xmath44:@xmath45 is thus 1:2:0 at source .",
    "taking into account neutrino oscillations , the flavor ratio observed at earth is 1:1:1 @xcite .",
    "however , kashti and waxman @xcite point out that at energies greater than @xmath39  1  pev , the @xmath46 in equation  ( [ eqn : pgamma ] ) loses energy through synchrotron radiation before decaying .",
    "this energy loss changes the source neutrino flavor ratio at high energies from 1:2:0 to 0:1:0 , leading to a ratio at earth of 1:1.8:1.8 .",
    "neutrino production is predicted to be simultaneous with gamma ray production .",
    "amanda grb analyses use the waxman - bahcall @xcite broken power law neutrino spectrum as a reference hypothesis ( see fig .",
    "however , other models of prompt neutrino emission have also been tested .",
    "these include the paramaterization of murase and nagataki @xcite , who arrive at a similar spectrum to waxman - bahcall under different assumptions , as well as the supranova scenario ( now disfavored due to evidence from the swift satellite ) which assumes grb jet interactions with an external matter field created by a supernova preceding the burst by @xmath391 week @xcite .",
    "predictions have also been made for precursor @xcite and afterglow @xcite emission .",
    "the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) @xcite is located at the south pole . from 1997 to 1999 , amanda consisted of 302 optical modules on 10 strings and was referred to as amanda - b10 .",
    "the final configuration , amanda - ii , was commisioned in the year 2000 and consists of a total of 677 optical modules on 19 strings .",
    "each module contains a photomultiplier tube and supporting hardware inside a pressurized glass sphere .",
    "the optical modules are used to indirectly detect neutrinos by measuring the cherenkov light from secondary charged particles produced in neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "amanda uses two detection channels .",
    "muon tracks are produced through interactions of @xmath47 , while cascades ( particle showers ) are produced from interactions of all three neutrino flavors .",
    "the muon channel has a larger effective areas because of the longer range of muons compared to cascades .",
    "it also has better pointing resolution because muons produce linear tracks rather than spherical showers . separating neutrino signals from the dominant atmospheric muon background",
    "is accomplished by removing downgoing events , so muon analyses have @xmath48 sr sky coverage .",
    "cascades are differentiated from downgoing muons by their shape and therefore cascade analyses have full ( 4@xmath49 sr ) sky coverage .",
    "cascade events also have better energy resolution than muon tracks , since the energy of all particles produced in the shower is accounted for .",
    "in the majority of grb analyses , searches are done in coincidence with @xmath35-ray detections by satellites . because these analyses only search for a neutrino signal during the time and ( in the case of muon channel searches ) in the location of measured bursts , there is almost no on - source background in these analyses .",
    "the period of time actually examined for a neutrino signal for each burst is equal to the measured duration of prompt gamma - ray emission , plus the uncertainty in this measurement , plus an additional second on each side of the on - time window .",
    "background was measured for a period of one hour both before and after each burst , with the ten minute period immediately surrounding the burst remaining unexamined to avoid the possibility of contaminating the background with neutrino signal . in the muon channel ,",
    "searches for prompt emission have been conducted for 312 bursts measured by the batse detector ( aboard the cgro satellite ) and 95 bursts analyzed by the ipn3 satellite .",
    "additionally , a search for precursor emission was conducted using 60 bursts from the 2001 - 2003 data sets @xcite . using the cascade channel , 73 bursts identified by the batse detector in the year 2000",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "no events have been observed in coincidence with any bursts studied so far , which is consistent with the expected background .",
    "the _ rolling _ analysis provides a useful complement to these triggered searches .",
    "this method does not use satellite triggers , but scans an entire multi - year data sample for a statistical excess of events within one of two pre - set time windows ( to account for both long and short burst classes ) .",
    "this allows this analysis to search for grbs and other transients not identified by satellites .",
    "the rolling search has been conducted for the years 2001 - 2003 ( after the batse detector was ceased operations and before the swift satellite launched ) using the cascade channel .",
    "due to the larger amount of data analyzed relative to the triggered analyses , more stringent cuts on the data are required . thus , background rejection was accomplished with a six cut - variable support vector machine , optimized for the best chance for signal discovery . as in the case of the triggered searches ,",
    "no evidence of astrophysical neutrinos has been found with this analysis method .",
    "the maximum number of observed events and the numbers of observed windows with multiple ( 2 or 3 ) events is consistent with the predicted background @xcite .",
    "although the waxman - bahcall neutrino spectrum functions as a reference for grb analyses , it has been demonstrated that neutrino spectra from individual bursts can vary significantly from this `` standard '' spectrum @xcite .",
    "current amanda analyses are using more sophisticated methods to predict the spectrum and neutrino rates for individual bursts rather than assuming averaged parameters .",
    "the particularly close and bright burst grb030329 was the first burst to be given this individualized treatment @xcite .",
    "bursts detected by swift , many of which have redshifts directly measured from afterglow data , will be especially conducive to this method .",
    "icecube , the successor to amanda , is currently under construction , with the final detector scheduled be completed by 2011 .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that a triggered search using 300 - 500 bursts with the full icecube array would suffice to either set limits at levels lower than the predictions by waxman - bahcall or find evidence of the existence of neutrinos in coincidence with grbs with better than 5@xmath50 confidence ."
