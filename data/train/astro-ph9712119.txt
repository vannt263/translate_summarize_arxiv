    "lyman limit absorption systems ( lls ) , observed as breaks in quasar spectra at the rest - frame wavelength of the lyman continuum edge , are produced by gaseous clouds optically thick to lyman continuum photons .",
    "these systems can be observed over a wide range of redshift , from @xmath8 to approximately that of the highest - redshift quasars .",
    "thus , such systems can be used to probe the gas in the universe at various redshifts . due to their relatively high hi column density ( @xmath9 ) , these systems are usually thought to arise from photoionized clouds in gaseous galactic halos ( see e.g. steidel 1990 , mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "there is now direct observational evidence that some of the lls are indeed associated with galaxies ( see e.g. steidel 1995 ) , at least at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "this is not surprising , because any hi disk like that of our own galaxy will produce a lls when intersecting a sightline to a quasar .",
    "however , the observed rate of incidence ( i.e. the number of systems per sightline per unit redshift ) of lls is large and increases rapidly with redshift ( stengler - larrea 1995 ) ; there is no indication of a reversal of this trend even for the lls with the highest redshift @xmath11 observed so far ( storrie - lombardi 1994 ) . the observed rate of incidence of lls at @xmath12 is about 30 times larger than that expected from the local number density of galaxies with absorption cross sections given by the optical holmberg radius .",
    "thus , if lls at @xmath13 were also associated with galaxies , it would mean that ( 1 ) most galaxies have already formed at that redshift , and ( 2 ) the absorption cross sections of galaxies are much larger at high redshifts .",
    "however , in a hierarchical model of structure formation , such as the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model and its variants , the number density and sizes of galaxies are small at high redshifts , because most gas has not yet been assembled into large galaxies ( mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that lls observed at high redshifts are due to galactic populations .",
    "it is possible that a large fraction of the observed lls at high redshifts are produced by photoionized clouds in small halos .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations show that low column density absorption systems can be produced by gas in filamentary structures that arise from the gravitational collapse of initial density fluctuations ( e.g. cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1996 ; miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the number densities of lls given by these simulations were , however , found to be lower by a factor of about ten than what is observed ( e.g. katz 1996 ) .",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath3 may be explained by the population of pressure - confined clouds in gaseous halos that are not resolved by current simulations ( mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath0 , however , was not explained by previous investigations based on photoionization models in hierarchical cosmogonies ( e.g. gardner 1996 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the flux of the uv background may drop substantially at @xmath14 and the hi column density of a cloud could be underestimated in models assuming a constant uv flux .",
    "however , recent observational results based on the proximity effect show that the uv flux at the lyman continuum edge is about @xmath15 at @xmath11 ( williger 1994 ; giallongo 1996 ; lu 1996 ) . this value of the uv flux is already comparable to , or even higher than , the ones used in most of the model considerations mentioned above .",
    "in this paper we suggest the possibility that the discrepancy between model predictions and observations of the lls at high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) is a result of the neglect of the contribution of minihalos that collapsed prior to reionization .",
    "the gas in such small systems is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with column density @xmath1 . because of their high density and high hi column density , these clouds will not be destroyed , or ionized by the onset of the uv background at a later time .",
    "they will therefore produce lls at lower redshifts , if not disrupted by other processes .",
    "we present our model for the lls observed at high redshifts and compute their number per unit redshift in section  2 . a brief discussion of our model is given in section  3 .",
    "for simplicity we assume the universe to be flat with the cosmic density parameter @xmath17 . the hubble constant is written as @xmath18 .",
    "prior to the epoch of reionization the physical properties of cosmological structures can be estimated from the spherical collapse model ( see e.g. padmanabhan , 1993 ) .",
    "the gas in a collapsing dark matter perturbation is shock heated to the virial temperature @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the three dimensional virial velocity of the halo , @xmath21 the proton mass , and @xmath22 the mean mass per particle .",
    "the total h number density in a dark matter halo that collapses at a redshift , @xmath2 , with an overdensity @xmath23 at virialization reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the closure density . assuming that dark halos are singular isothermal spheres with density profile @xmath26 , the virial radius @xmath27 , defined as the radius within which the mean mass overdensity is  @xmath28 ,",
    "can be written : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cosmic time at @xmath2 .    for halos with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 )",
    "the gaseous component can not be collisonally ionized and will remain neutral .",
    "due to the high collapse redshifts ( @xmath33 ) considered here , the recombination time scale in minihalos is shorter than the hubble time , and the gas in clouds with @xmath34 before reionization will also be neutral shortly after their formation . as a result , the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms , @xmath35 , is given by @xmath36 the corresponding total mass of such a halo is @xmath37 it is clear that the optical depth at the photoionization threshold , @xmath38 exceeds unity for a wide range of collapse redshifts and virial velocities .    to determine what happens to the clouds once the uv background switches on we analyze the equilibrium equation of the ionized fraction for a pure hydrogen gas , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the free electron and total baryonic number density , respectively .",
    "this fraction is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 \\sigma     ( \\nu )    d\\nu$ ] and @xmath44 denote the rate coefficients for photoionization of neutral hydrogen and radiative recombination to , respectively .",
    "motivated by the indirect measurements from the proximity effect ( see giallongo 1996 , and references therein ) we assume the background uv flux to be given by a powerlaw @xmath45 where @xmath46 is planck s constant and @xmath47 is the ionization threshold . in the optical thick limit the photoionization rate coefficient can be approximated by a power law @xmath48^{-\\beta}$ ] , where @xmath49 is the total column density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 has a non  trivial dependence on @xmath51 and is determined numerically to vary from @xmath52 to @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "inserting this approximate expression for the photoionization rate into the equilibrium equation for the free electron fraction [ ] yields the implicit solution for  @xmath55 @xmath56 which for @xmath57 reduces to the more familiar optical thin case .",
    "we adopt @xmath58 for the spectral index , with which the photoionization rate can be approximated by @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the right hand side of has a maximum at @xmath61 with a value of @xmath62 .",
    "the existence of this maximum shows that ionization equilibrium can not be achieved for @xmath63 . in this case photoionization overcomes recombination and ionizes the gas until a new , highly ionized , equilibrium state is reached at column densities @xmath64 . as discussed in mcket and kates ( 1997 )",
    ", the evolution of such systems from one equilibrium state to another can be rapid .",
    "the recombination rate suitable for an equilibrium temperature of @xmath65 is @xmath66 ( ferland 1992 ) .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath67 , the maximum of @xmath68 can be used to derive a critical total hydrogen column density @xmath69 .",
    "note that this column density is calculated at the edge of the cloud and is approximately equal to @xmath70 [ see and ] .",
    "we can therefore define a minimum collapse redshift , @xmath71 , for halos of a given virial velocity , so that they will remain optically thick if they form at @xmath72 .",
    "this minimum collapse redshift can be written as @xmath73 as we will show below , minihalos ( with @xmath74 ) in current hierarchical models have typical collapse redshifts higher than this critical value ; they can therefore retain their high initial column densities .    to check the robustness of the above derivation for the critical collapse redshift we have integrated the time - dependent chemistry and cooling model presented in abel  ( 1997a ) .",
    "we found good agreement between the numerical results and the analytic expression of the critical redshift given by .",
    "the density of gas contained in minihalos considered here is quite high due to their high collapse redshifts .",
    "the recombination time scale for the gas is short , about @xmath75myr , which makes them stable against photoionization from internal stellar sources . on the other hand",
    ", only a few supernova explosions may be able to blow out most of the gas from the halos ( see ciardi & ferrara , 1997 , and references therein ) if star formation can happen in them .",
    "however , systems that form in halos with @xmath76 at @xmath77 are not be able to cool since formation is inefficient in these halos at such redshifts ( see tegmark 1997 , and abel 1997b ) . also the uv flux of the first structures in the universe may lead to photodissociation prior to reionization ( haiman , rees and loeb  1997 ) , inhibiting line cooling by .",
    "furthermore line cooling is not efficient due to the low virial temperature ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus these systems may not form stars and hence are not subject to `` blow away '' .",
    "the gas can only be gravitationally confined in the dark matter halo if the typical particle velocity is less than the escape velocity of the halo .",
    "the mean particle velocity of hydrogen atoms in a maxwellian distribution is @xmath79 for a neutral gas , and the escape velocity is given roughly by @xmath80 .",
    "hence only systems with @xmath81 are stable against evaporation .",
    "these considerations suggest that minihalos with @xmath82-@xmath83 are most likely to produce lls .",
    "the typical collapse redshift of halos with @xmath84 in current cosmogonies such as the standard cdm model exceeds the critical redshift given in .",
    "such small halos are also abundant at high redshift in these models .",
    "it is therefore possible that minihalos contribute a substantial part of the total number of lls at high redshifts .",
    "here we examine this possibility .",
    "we assume that minihalos which form at @xmath72 and do not merge into larger systems by a redshift @xmath85 will contribute to the absorption cross section at @xmath85 .",
    "the conditional probability , @xmath86 , that a halo of mass @xmath87 selected at redshift @xmath88 will have merged to form a halo of mass between @xmath89 and @xmath90 at a later redshift @xmath91 , can be calculated from the extended press - schechter formalism ( bond 1991 ; bower 1991 ) . as in lacey & cole ( 1994 ) ,",
    "halos are assumed to be destroyed by redshift @xmath85 , if they have merged into halos of twice their initial mass by that redshift .",
    "the fraction of minihalos that form at @xmath88 and survive merging until @xmath85 , @xmath92 , can then be obtained from @xmath93 the absorption cross section of a minihalo is assumed to be spherical with radius given by .",
    "the result for a standard cdm model normalized to @xmath94 is given for three different bins of virial velocities in figure  1 . in the calculation @xmath88",
    "is chosen as the redshift at which the comoving number density of halos prediced by the press - schechter formalism peaks .",
    "this corresponds to the collapse redshift of a @xmath95 peak . in all cases , @xmath96 .",
    "clearly , the total number of systems with @xmath97 is sufficient to explain the observed number of llss at @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the observational evidence that lls at low redshift are associated with galaxies ( see steidel 1996 ) . as shown in mo & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) , clouds pressure - confined in galactic halos can indeed give a sufficiently large cross section to explain the number density of lls at @xmath3 .",
    "note that for current low-@xmath98 cosmogonic models having smaller power on small scales than the standard cdm model , the number density of minihalos may be reduced .",
    "however , the predicted number of absorption systems per unit redshift may not be reduced substantially , because it depends also on @xmath99 ( the proper distance per unit redshift ) and the virial radius , both are larger in a low-@xmath98 model .",
    "the dependence on cosmological parameters can not be examined in detail until more detailed hydrodynamical calculations are able to determine the physical sizes of the absorbers .",
    "it is important to realize the difference between our model and the minihalo model proposed by rees ( 1986 ) for lyman alpha forest systems . in the model of rees , minihalos are optically thin , highly ionized and have an hi column density of @xmath100 , characteristic for lyman alpha forest systems .",
    "this assumption is correct for minihalos that collapse after reionization from an already ionized intergalactic medium at redshifts @xmath101 [ see  ] .",
    "as shown in thoul and weinberg ( 1996 ) , after reionization the collapse of gas can only happen in halos with @xmath102 , and so minihalos ( with @xmath103 ) that form after reionization are not expected to give a significant contribution to the lls .",
    "in contrast , prior to reionization the collapse of gas can even happen in halos with @xmath20 as small as about @xmath104 .",
    "our model for the lls envisages a hierarchical cosmogony where a large number of minihalos ( with @xmath105 ) can form prior to the epoch of reionization .",
    "we show that the gas trapped in such minihalos is , due to its high density , able to withstand photoionization by the uv background set on at a later time and reaches thermal and chemical equilibrium at a temperature @xmath106 . by including these systems , the discrepancy in the number of lls between the observational result and earlier theoretical predictions based on cdm models",
    "can be reconciled .",
    "the model predicts the number density of lls to keep increasing towards higher redshifts .",
    "the minihalo population is assumed to form at a time when the gas in the igm is largely primordial . as a result",
    ", the absorbing gas in these systems should also have a close to primordial composition .",
    "although later accretion of gas from the enriched igm may increase the metallicity , we expect the metallicity of such lls to be low .",
    "minihalos with @xmath107 are expected to dominate the total cross section of lls at high redshifts , because ( i ) they can form in the low - pressure igm prior to reionization , ( 2 ) they are stable against evaporation , ( 3 ) they can not cool by or to form stars and so are not subject to supernova explosion or internal photoionization , and ( 4 ) their total cross section is large in hierarchical models .",
    "thus , the minihalo population of the lls should be observed to have a narrow range of velocity widths ( with doppler parameters of @xmath108 ) .",
    "this can be tested by high - resolution spectroscopy of lls at high redshifts .",
    "the two lls at redshifts 3.32 and 2.80 studied by tytler ( 1996 ) using the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope have doppler parameters and velocity offsets between individual components less than @xmath83 .",
    "this is consistent with our model .",
    "obviously more high - resolution data at high redshifts are needed to constrain the fraction of lls in the minihalo population .",
    "the sizes for the minihalo absorbers are typically about 1 kpc , which may be tested by the spectra of gravitationally - lensed quasar pairs at high redshifts .",
    "much theoretical work remains to be done to model the hydrodynamic and radiative - transfer processes to obtain more accurate predictions for the properties of the minihalo lyman limit systems proposed here .",
    "we thank jordi miralda - escud , avi loeb , karsten jedamzik , sandra savaglio , paul shapiro , andrea ferrara , and simon white for comments on an earlier draft of this paper .",
