    "<S> reversible spin hall effect comprising the `` direct '' and `` inverse '' spin hall effects was successfully detected at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental demonstration proves the fundamental relations called onsager reciprocal relations between spin and charge currents . </S>",
    "<S> a platinum wire with a strong spin - orbit interaction is used not only as a spin current absorber but also as a spin current source in the present lateral structure specially designed for clear detection of both charge and spin accumulations via the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained spin hall conductivity is much larger than the reported value of aluminum wire because of the larger spin - orbit interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic science for electronic devices aiming at manipulating the spin degree of freedom is spintronics , which provides a possible means to realize advantageous functionalities for spin based recording and information processing . for such functions , the usage of spin current </S>",
    "<S> , a flow of spin angular momentum , is indispensable . thus establishing techniques for efficient generation and manipulation of spin currents </S>",
    "<S> is a key for further advancement of spintronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> there is a novel phenomenon where the spin - orbit interaction converts a charge current into a spin current and vice versa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are known as the `` direct '' and `` inverse '' spin hall effects ( she s ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the she was first predicted in 1971 by dyakonov and perel@xcite , followed by the phenomenological theory with impurity scattering developed by hirsch @xcite , and extended to the diffusive transport regime by zhang@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the she has attracted considerable interest because of the potentiality for generation and manipulation of spin currents in nonmagnets without external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> although there have recently been many theoretical studies on the she ( @xcite ) , few experimental reports exist because of difficult sample fabrication and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> kato et al . reported the first experimental observation of the she induced spin accumulation via magneto - optical kerr effect in gaas semiconductor systems@xcite . shortly after this measurement </S>",
    "<S> , the she in a 2 deg system was demonstrated using similar optical technique@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although two kinds of extrinsic @xcite and intrinsic @xcite mechanisms for the she are proposed to explain the experimental results@xcite , the detailed origin of the observed phenomena is still unclear .    in diffusive normal metals , the she is known to be induced by the spin - orbit scattering , which is an extrinsic effect due to impurities or defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the optical detection technique is limited for semiconductor systems , the electrical detection technique is suitable for observing the she in diffusive metals . </S>",
    "<S> the unpolarized charge current flowing in a nonmagnet generates the transverse spin current , and results in the spin accumulation along the side edge of the nonmagnet . </S>",
    "<S> inversely , the spin current flowing in a nonmagnet induces the transverse charge current , and causes the charge accumulation ( inverse she)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the first clear observation of the charge accumulation due to the inverse she is reported by using a nonlocal spin injection in a lateral ferromagnetic / nonmagnetic metal structure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observation has been performed only at low temperatures possibly because of a small spin - orbit interaction of aluminium . to induce a large measurable inverse she even at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> a large spin - orbit scattering is required . </S>",
    "<S> platinum is known to exhibit a large spin - orbit interaction because of the large atomic number with respect to nonmagnetic impurities or defects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the conventional lateral structure @xcite with nonlocal spin injection is not applicable to detect the she because of an extremely short spin diffusion length of about 10 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an experimental report of the charge accumulation due to the inverse she in the pt strip using a spin pumping technique@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large sample size makes it difficult to evaluate the important parameters related to the she .    although the `` inverse '' she has been reported by the groups mentioned above , there has never been electrically observed the `` direct '' she ( , i. e. , the conversion of the charge current to the spin current , ) in all metallic systems up to now . here </S>",
    "<S> we report a clear observation of the spin and charge accumulations due to the direct and inverse she s at room temperature induced in the pt wire using nonlocal spin injection , spin absorption , and spin - generation techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the onsager reciprocal relations between the `` direct '' and the `` inverse '' she s .    </S>",
    "<S> our device for the present she experiment consists of lateral ferromagnetic / nonmagnetic metallic junctions as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of a large permalloy ( py ) pad 30 nm in thickness , a cu cross 100 nm in width and 80 nm in thickness , and a pt wire 80 nm in width and 4 nm in thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the junction between the py injector and cu wire , is chosen to be 100 nm @xmath0 100 nm to induce a large spin accumulation in the cu wire . </S>",
    "<S> the distance from the center of the injector to the center of the pt wire is 400 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivities of the py , cu and pt are @xmath1 @xmath2 m , @xmath3 @xmath2 m and @xmath4 @xmath2 m at rt and @xmath5 @xmath2 m , @xmath6 @xmath2 m and @xmath7 @xmath2 m at 77k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the surfaces of py injector and pt wire is carefully cleaned by low voltage ar ion milling prior to the cu deposition . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained interfaces have very low resistances in the milli - ohm range , indicating good ohmic contact .    when the charge current is injected from a ferromagnetic py pad into a non - magnetic cu cross and is drained from one of the top and bottom arms ( see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) , the accumulated spins at the junction induce the diffusive flow of the spin current along the cu wire as can be understood from the electrochemical potential map in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the distance between the py / cu and cu / pt junctions @xmath8 is shorter than the spin diffusion length of about 500 nm@xcite , the spin current should be absorbed into the pt wire from the cu cross . according to previous experiments@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the spin current and spin accumulation can be calculated by taking into account the spin resistance , defined as @xmath9 with the spin diffusion length @xmath10 , the spin polarization @xmath11 , the conductivity @xmath12 , and the effective cross sectional area @xmath13 for the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of the spin resistance is a measure of the difficulty for spin mixing over the spin diffusion length . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current in the spin - accumulated material is thus preferably absorbed into the additionally connected material with small spin resistance . here </S>",
    "<S> the spin resistance of pt wire is an order of magnitude smaller than that of cu wire . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the induced spin current in the cu cross can be directed into the pt wire as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) .    the injected spin current into the pt wire vanishes immediately in the vicinity of the pt / cu junction because of the short spin diffusion length of the pt . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the spin current flows almost perpendicular to the junction plane as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current @xmath14 is generated in the pt wire via the inverse she when the spin current @xmath15 enters the pt wire . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the current @xmath14 is given by the vector product @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spin direction , yielding the flow of charge current normal to both the spin current @xmath15 and the spin direction @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and 1(c ) , the up- and down - spin electrons flow opposite to each other as the flow of the electron is determined by the gradient of electrochemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> such flows of up- and down - spins could induce the transverse voltage due to the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the spin currents polarized along the x - axis is injected into the pt wire , the charge accumulation along the y - axis is induced in the pt wire . </S>",
    "<S> it should be remarked here that the inverse transformation from the charge current @xmath14 to the spin current @xmath15 is also expected when the configuration of injector and detector probes is reversed as illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) and 1(e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to observe the charge accumulation due to the inverse she , we first measure the hall voltage @xmath18 induced in the pt wire by means of the nonlocal spin injection . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - polarized charge current is injected from the py pad into the cu cross . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is applied along the x - axis to maximize the charge accumulation in the pt wire . as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) , the clear change in @xmath19 appears both at rt and 77 k. the @xmath19 curves show hysteresis , assuring that the charge accumulation is induced by the spin current from the py injector . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath20 , defined as the overall change of @xmath19 , is increased up to 160 m@xmath2 at 77k . </S>",
    "<S> the observed change in signal does not depend on the choice of the cu arm and the similar results were observed in other two devices , assuring good reproducibility . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that in this device configuration the charge accumulation can be induced by the in - plane component of the py magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this is a great advantage because the influence of the demagnetizing field can be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore unlike previous metallic device the magnetization direction of the spin injector py can be controlled at will by small in - plane magnetic fields below a few hundreds oersted .    to understand the relation between the direction of the injected spins @xmath17 and the induced charge accumulation , the angular dependence of @xmath19 is measured as a function of the in - plane field h along the tilting angle f from the x - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the induced @xmath20 decreases with transverse magnetic component ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , and 3(b ) ) , and vanishes when the magnetization is aligned with the y - axis ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> from the relation @xmath21 , the angular dependence of the @xmath20 is expected to vary with @xmath22 . figure 3(d ) shows clear @xmath22 variations of @xmath20 both at rt and 77 k in good agreement with the prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the transformation from the charge current @xmath14 to the spin current @xmath15 , which is the `` direct '' she , is examined using the probe configuration in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in the above described experiment , the pt wire is used as a spin - current absorber , but the pt wire now acts as a spin - current source , the latter of which is much more important for the application of spintronics without using a ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show the field dependences of the induced spin accumulation signal @xmath23 in the pt wire measured at rt and 77 k. @xmath23 varies similarly to @xmath24 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) and more importantly the overall resistance change @xmath25 is exactly the same as @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that both the spin to charge and the charge to spin current transformations are reversible , corresponding to the onsager reciprocal relations , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the spin - current - induced spin - hall conductivity and the charge - current - induced spin - hall conductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin hall conductivity of the pt wire is here evaluated as follows ; in the experiments of spin - current induced charge accumulation shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and 1(c ) , the injected spin current @xmath29 into the pt wire is approximated by assuming that both the spin resistances @xmath30 of py and @xmath31 of pt are much smaller than @xmath32 of cu@xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the spin diffusion length of cu , the spin polarization of py and the injected charge current . </S>",
    "<S> the spin hall conductivity @xmath27 can be given by the following equation@xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the width of the pt wire ( 80 nm in the present study ) . by using @xmath39 = 0.2 , @xmath40 = 3 nm , @xmath41 = 500 nm </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the value of @xmath27 as 2.4 @xmath42 ( @xmath2m)@xmath43 . thus , the ratio of the spin hall conductivity to the electrical conductivity @xmath44 for pt is deduced to be 3.7 @xmath0 10@xmath45 , 30 times larger than that for al obtained in a previous experiment@xcite , as expected from the larger atomic number of pt compared with al . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless spin orbit parameter @xmath46 can also be calculated to be 0.74 from the relation with the fermi wave vector @xmath47 1 @xmath0 @xmath48 m@xmath43 and the mean free path @xmath49 20 nm for pt@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantitatively in good agreement with the value of 0.80 separately calculated using the equation @xmath50 with the quantum resistance @xmath51@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result opens up a new possibility to use normal metals with high spin - orbit coupling as spin current sources operating at room temperature for the future spintronic applications . </S>"
