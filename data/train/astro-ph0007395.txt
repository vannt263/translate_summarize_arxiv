    "sky surveys play an important role in astronomy . large collections of objects allow reliable studies of the average properties of different constituents of the universe ; new populations can be found and well defined sub - samples can be extracted for further detailed analysis .",
    "+ surveys in the radio domain have yielded many important results in the past , since the discovery of radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the first samples of radio sources ( @xmath6 jy ) have demonstrated that classical radio galaxies are rare in the local universe and strongly evolve with cosmic time both in density and luminosity ( e.g. longair @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , deep radio surveys ( @xmath7 mjy ) have shown that normalized radio counts show a flattening below a few mjy , corresponding to a steepening in the actual observed counts ( see e.g. windhorst et al .",
    "@xcite for counts at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "this change of slope is generally interpreted as being due to the presence of a new population of radio sources ( the so - called sub - mjy population ) which does not show up at higher flux densities ( see e.g. condon @xcite ) . to explain the new faint radio population several scenarios",
    "have been invoked : strongly - evolving normal spirals ( condon @xcite , @xcite ) ; actively star forming galaxies ( e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; or a non - evolving population of local ( z @xmath8 0.1 ) low - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. wall et al .",
    "the true nature of the population is not well established .",
    "the same is true for the relative contributions from the above mentioned objects .",
    "furthermore the source space density inferred from the faint end of the local bivariate luminosity function for both spirals and ellipticals is not well known ( see e.g. condon @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is not possible to estimate the local contribution to the counts ( even if expected to be small ) nor is there a clear local reference frame for understanding evolutionary phenomena .",
    "+ unfortunately , due to the long observing times required to reach faint fluxes , the existing samples in the sub - mjy region are generally small .",
    "table  [ rad - surv ] shows a compilation of the largest 1.4 ghz surveys available in the mjy and sub - mjy regime with the surveyed areas and limiting fluxes ( note , however , that the quoted limiting fluxes are often not uniform over the entire areas ) . + the identification work and subsequent spectroscopy are very demanding in terms of telescope time . typically , no more than @xmath9 of the radio sources in sub - mjy samples have been identified on optical images , even though for the @xmath4jy survey in the hubble deep field an identification rate of about 80@xmath10 has been reached ( richards et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical fraction of spectra available is only @xmath11 .",
    "the best studied sample is the marano field , where @xmath12 of the sources have spectral information ( gruppioni et al .",
    "@xcite ) . + to establish a firm point in the radio properties of galaxies in the local ( z @xmath8 0.2 ) universe it is necessary to survey a large area in the sky down to faint flux limits .",
    "furthermore it is necessary to have in the same region a statistically significant sample of galaxies with well studied optical properties ( radial velocities , magnitudes etc . ) . to alleviate the identification work , regions with deep photometry ( possibly multicolor ) already available",
    "provide a significant advantage .",

    "the radio observations were carried out with two main goals in mind . the first aim was to detect the esp galaxies in order to derive the ` local ' ( @xmath24 ) bivariate luminosity function .",
    "we therefore tried to keep the sensitivity as uniform as possible over the whole esp area , while at the same time reaching flux densities well below @xmath25 mjy ( see sect .",
    "[ sec - freqres ] ) .",
    "+ the second aim was to have a complete catalogue of faint radio sources in order to study the sub - mjy population through a programme of optical identification of complete radio source samples extracted from the atesp survey , exploiting the available data , i.e. deep ccd images .",
    "+ as the survey is intended to achieve uniform sensitivity over a large area it is necessary to make use of the mosaicing technique .",
    "mosaicing is the combination of regularly spaced multiple pointings of a radio telescope which are then linearly combined to produce an image larger than the radio telescope s primary beam .",
    "the linear mosaicing consists of a weighted average of the pixels in the individual pointings , with the weights determined by the primary beam response and the expected noise level ( see equation in sault & killeen @xcite ) .",
    "if the observing parameters and conditions are the same for every individual pointing , the expected noise variance in any observed field can be assumed to be equal for every observing field and the intensity distribution in the mosaiced final image , @xmath26 , is modulated only by the primary beam response : @xmath27 where the summation is over the set of pointing centres @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the image formed from the @xmath30-th pointing ( not corrected for the primary beam response ) and @xmath31 is the primary beam pattern . + in planning a mosaicing experiment , the main issue to be decided is the pointing grid pattern , i.e. geometry and pointing spacings . for a detection experiment on a large area of sky ( like the atesp survey )",
    "the main requirement is uniform sensitivity over the entire region together with high observing efficiency .",
    "such requirement can be satisfied by choosing opportunely the pointing grid pattern .",
    "+ the mosaic noise standard deviation , @xmath32 , can be obtained from the error propagation of eq .",
    "[ eq - igrid2 ] and the uniform sensitivity constraint is expressed by @xmath33 for every position @xmath34 . in other words ,",
    "the mosaic sensitivity , expressed in terms of @xmath35s ( @xmath35 is the noise expected in the individual pointings ) is modulated by the squared sum of the primary beam response .",
    "+ the atca primary beam pattern can be approximated by a circular gaussian function ( wieringa & kesteven @xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the radial distance from the image phase center and fwhp is the _ full width at half power _ of the primary beam ( @xmath3 33 arcmin for atca observations at 1.4 ghz ) . since the square of a gaussian is still a gaussian with fwhp reduced by a factor @xmath38 , the quadratic sum in eq .",
    "[ eq - noisegrid2 ] can be written as a linear sum of gaussians with fwhp@xmath39 ( corresponding to @xmath40 for atca 1.4 ghz observations ) .",
    "+ to make the final choice for the atesp survey grid pattern , we have performed a series of simulations of the bidimensional quantity @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and fwhp@xmath44 , varying the pointing spacings @xmath45 and the grid geometry ( hexagonal and/or rectangular grids ) . + in general a very good compromise between uniform sensitivity and observing efficiency is represented by a grid pattern with pointing spacings of the order of @xmath46 . for our particular case , the best choice turned out to be a @xmath47 spacing rectangular grid . the mosaic noise variations over a reference area of 1  sq .",
    "for such a grid configuration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - simrect ] .",
    "as expected , in the region of interest ( central box ) the noise is rather constant : variations are @xmath48 , except at the region borders ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we point out that hexagonal grids should be preferred when imaging wide areas of sky ( like for the nvss and first radio surveys ) , but are not very efficient in the case of a narrow 1-degree wide strip of sky .      at 20 cm ( the longest observing wavelength available at the atca ) the field of view is largest ( gaussian primary beam fwhp@xmath50 ) and",
    "the system noise is lowest .",
    "thus , observing at 20 cm allows minimization of both the number of fields ( i.e. pointings ) required to complete the survey and the observing time spent on each field .",
    "the atca can observe at two frequencies simultaneously ( for instance 20 and 13 cm ) .",
    "however , we decided to optimize sensitivity at the expense of spectral information , by setting both receivers in the 20 cm band and observing in continuum mode ( @xmath51 mhz bandwidth , each divided into @xmath52 mhz channels in order to reduce the bandwidth smearing effect ) .",
    "this choice was also influenced by another consideration : since the field of view depends on the observing frequency , the grid pattern could not be optimized to get uniform sensitivity for both 13 and 20 cm bands simultaneously .",
    "+ the observations were carried out at full resolution ( atca 6 km configuration ) , since the identification follow up benefits from high spatial resolution , and the expected fraction of very extended sources ( that could be resolved out and lost ) is low at the atesp resolution . using the angular size distribution given by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for radio sources , we estimate that @xmath53 of the mjy and sub  mjy sources would appear point ",
    "like at the atesp resolution , and @xmath54 would have angular sizes twice the beam size or larger .",
    "+ since the esp sample distance distribution peaks at @xmath55 and ` normal ' galaxies are typically low - power radio sources , deep radio observations were needed to ensure detections of a statistically significant number of esp galaxies .",
    "we considered satisfactory a point source radio limit of the order of @xmath56mjy ( @xmath57 ) , which corresponds to a detection threshold of @xmath58 w hz@xmath59 at @xmath60 ( h@xmath61 km / s mpc@xmath59 ) .",
    "furthermore a large sample of sub - mjy radio sources can be constructed at a @xmath62 detection limit , corresponding to a flux limit of @xmath63 mjy .",
    "to cover the two areas of @xmath64 ( region a ) and @xmath65 ( region b ) of the esp survey with uniform sensitivity , @xmath66 and @xmath67 pointings at @xmath47 spacing are needed respectively .",
    "an area of 1.3 sq .  degs .",
    "( @xmath68 pointings ) of region a was not observed , because of the presence of the strong radio source pmnj2326 - 4027 , which would have prevented us from reaching the deep noise level required .",
    "this reduced the total number of fields to be observed to @xmath69 ( region a ) and @xmath67 ( region b ) , i.e. @xmath70 pointings in total .",
    "the right ascension range actually covered by the atesp survey is thus @xmath71  @xmath72 and @xmath73 to @xmath74 ( j2000 ) .",
    "+ an observing time of 1.2 hours per pointing was needed to reach a @xmath57 rms noise level of @xmath75 mjy ( with @xmath51 mhz bandwidth ) . to obtain good hour angle coverage we organized the snapshot observations as follows : the 320 fields were divided in 16 sets of 20 fields each ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "every set was then observed for @xmath77 , that is , the 20 fields were observed in sequence , for 1 minute each , repeating this for 72 times and adding 3 minutes for calibration every hour .",
    "+ the observing campaign started in november 1994 and was completed in january 1996 .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ tab - log ] ( dates , arrays used , observing time and frequencies ) .",
    "we stress that , for our purposes , the use of different 6 km arrays is not relevant in any way . + the two 128 mhz observing bands were set in the most interference - free region of the 20 cm band ( 1.31.5 ghz ) .",
    "+ the flux density calibration was performed through observations of the source pks b1934 - 638 , which is the standard primary calibrator for atca observations ( @xmath78 jy at @xmath79 mhz , baars et al .",
    "@xcite flux scale ) .",
    "the phase and gain calibration was based on observations of secondary calibrators , selected from the atca calibrator list .",
    "every single @xmath80 run and each of the two observing bands were calibrated separately following the standard procedures for atca observations .",
    ".log of the observations .",
    "[ tab - log ] [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec - imag ] , when the uv coverage is incomplete , the cleaning process can ` steal ' flux from real sources and redistribute it on top of noise peaks producing spurious ones . + to quantify the actual effect in our mosaics we performed a set of simulations by injecting point sources in the survey uv data at random positions .",
    "then the whole cleaning process was started .",
    "the number of sources injected in a mosaic ( @xmath81 ) was chosen in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty without changing significantly the components / image statistics .",
    "the source fluxes cover the entire range of the survey : 250 sources at 3@xmath35 , 100 at @xmath82 , 50 at @xmath83 , 50 at @xmath84 , 25 at @xmath85 , 10 at @xmath86 , 10 at @xmath87 , 10 at @xmath88 .",
    "+ taking into account the time and frequency resolution and the baseline lenghts , we get about 15002500 indepentent uv points for each field observed .",
    "this means that with about 2000 _ independent _ ( not too close together or on top of each other ) clean components we could clean the image to zero flux .",
    "the average number of ( not independent ) clean components per mosaic ranges between 1500 and 3200 .",
    "since we used a clean loop gain factor @xmath89 , the number of independent clean components per mosaic can be estimated as 1/10 of the numbers reported above .",
    "we thus expect a significant clean bias effect ( 10 - 20% ) , larger for mosaics with a higher number of cleaning components .",
    "we then decided to test three mosaics , with a low , an intermediate and a high average number of cleaning components ( cc s ) respectively : fld@xmath90to@xmath91 ( 1616 cc s ) , fld@xmath92to@xmath93 ( 2377 cc s ) and fld@xmath94to@xmath95 ( 3119 cc s ) .",
    "+ the results of the tests are presented in fig .  [ fig - cb1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - cb2 ] and summarized in table  [ tab - cb ] . fig .",
    "[ fig - cb1 ] shows , for each of the three mosaics , the average source flux measured after the cleaning ( @xmath96 ) normalized to the true source flux ( @xmath97 ) as a function of the flux itself ( expressed in terms of @xmath35 ) . in general the clean bias increases going to fainter fluxes and , as expected ,",
    "depends on the number of cleaning components . in the best case ( 1616 cc s )",
    "we get @xmath49 flux underestimation for the faintest sources ; in the worst case ( 3119 cc s ) the effect rises up to @xmath11 .",
    "+ the dependency of the clean bias on the number of cleaning components is more clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cb2 ] . here",
    "we present @xmath98 as a function of the average number of clean components for different source fluxes ( @xmath88 , @xmath87 , @xmath86 , etc . ) .",
    "again , the clean bias affects more seriously the faintest sources",
    ". moreover it is evident that we are not dealing with a linear effect : a sudden worsening appears at fluxes of the order of 1020@xmath35 and when the number of cleaning components exceeds @xmath99 .",
    "+ a first order fit of the clean bias effect for the three different mosaics has been obtained by applying the least squares method to the function @xmath100 .",
    "the values obtained for the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 are listed in table  [ tab - cb ] and the curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cb1 ] .",
    "the atesp survey at 1.4 ghz is based on snapshot observations of 320 overlapping primary beam fields , reduced separately and then combined together to produce 16 big mosaiced images . the total area surveyed with uniform sensitivity ( @xmath21 noise level @xmath103jy ) covers 25.9 sq .",
    "the spatial resolution is typically @xmath1 providing radio positions with internal accuracy of the order of 1 arcsec for @xmath62 radio sources .",
    "+ we stress the importance of estimating the relevance and the behaviour of the so called clean bias effect for any deep survey obtained with snapshot observations .",
    "the source fluxes can be seriously affected by such problem and for reliable scientific analysis the effect must be taken into account and corrected for .",
    "+ future papers in this series will deal with :    1 .",
