    ", we follow the evolution of a disk galaxy on its first passage through the group .",
    "the properties of this galaxy ( hereafter referred to as the target galaxy ) before it enters the group are summarized in table  [ tab - gprop ] .",
    "the middle and bottom panels in figure  [ fig - evol ] show face - on and edge - on views of the target galaxy , respectively .",
    "the contours give the surface density of the cold gas mass and the arrows show the velocity of the target galaxy with respect to the group velocity . throughout the _ letter _ , we define the cold ( hot ) gas as the gas with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig - sforb ] displays the time evolution of the distance of the target galaxy from the center of the group . from this panel",
    "it can be seen that the target galaxy first falls into the group ( i.e. within the virial radius ) around @xmath40 and makes its closest approach to the group center at z @xmath0 0.2 before moving beyond the virial radius again by @xmath30 .",
    "the second panel in figure  [ fig - sforb ] shows the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the target galaxy . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the sharp drop in the sfr after the galaxy passes the group pericenter , with star formation effectively ceasing by @xmath41 .",
    "the sharp drop in the sfr after the galaxy enters the group suggests the group environment can effectively quench star formation even in relatively low mass groups .",
    "after the galaxy enters the group , the cold gas displays a clear tail morphology in the direction opposite of the galaxy s motion ( see the @xmath42 panel in fig .",
    "[ fig - evol ] ) .",
    "such cold gas tails are often cited as evidence for ram - pressure stripping . to examine this possibility in our simulated group , we track the relative speed , @xmath43 , the hot gas density of the intra - group medium ( igm ) , @xmath44 , at the position of the target galaxy as a function of redshift ( fig .  [ fig - sforb ] ) , from which the ram - pressure , p@xmath45 , can be calculated . in figure",
    "[ fig - rf ] , we compare the estimated ram - pressure at @xmath42 with the restoring force for the cold and hot gas particles within the target galaxy . although the effect of ram - pressure , which should be time and spatial dependent , is more complicated than in the simulation , the figure provides a qualitative comparison and supports our results .",
    "figure  [ fig - rf ] demonstrates that the ram - pressure experienced by the target galaxy is well - below the amount required to strip the cold gas .",
    "we also examine how the fraction of the hot gas and cold gas particles within 30 kpc ( an arbitrary choice to include the majority of the cold gas but avoid contamination from the igm ) of the target galaxy evolves from @xmath42 to @xmath46 . figure  [ fig - fmh ] shows that virtually none of the cold gas escapes .",
    "interestingly , even the particles in the cold gas tail at @xmath42 do not escape from the galaxy .",
    "thus , we conclude that ram - pressure stripping of the cold gas component is not the cause of the downturn in the sfr .",
    "however , the majority ( @xmath47 % ) of the hot gas is indeed stripped since @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , a significant fraction of the hot gas is converted into cold gas .",
    "this suggests that hot gas halos are potentially an important source of cold gas in disk galaxies .",
    "furthermore , since ram - pressure is strong enough to strip the hot gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rf ] ) , the new supply of cold gas is cut - off . by @xmath41",
    "almost all the cold gas has turned into stars and star formation ceases .",
    "this is also demonstrated in the second panel of figure  [ fig - sforb ] which shows the _ net _ baryon mass - accretion and mass - loss rates of the target galaxy , i.e. , simply the difference in the total baryon mass divided by the time between the simulation outputs .",
    "before the target galaxy falls into the group , the mass - accretion rate is comparable to the sfr .",
    "however , the mass - loss due to the hot gas stripping becomes significant around @xmath48 , and the mass - accretion rate is no longer sufficient to sustain the sfr .",
    "therefore , we conclude that star formation is quenched in the target galaxy because of `` strangulation '' @xcite .    figure  [ fig - sforb ] shows some enhancement of star formation since @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that the group environment somehow enhances star formation , which accelerates the strangulation process .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig - sforb ] displays the hot and cold gas density in the target galaxy .",
    "the hot gas density decreases since @xmath48 due to the stripping and becomes close to the igm density . on the other hand ,",
    "the density of the cold gas where stars form significantly increases .",
    "one possibility is that the cold gas is compressed due to ram - pressure , which leads to enhanced star formation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the sph scheme can underestimate fluid instabilities , such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , which may be important for the stripping of cold gas @xcite . to test the impact of the khi in our simulation",
    ", we follow @xcite to estimate the timescale of the khi ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) for the target galaxy at @xmath42 when the hot gas stripping becomes significant . at @xmath50 kpc ( an arbitrary choice close to a radius where the hot gas stripping is expected in fig .",
    "[ fig - rf ] ) , we find that @xmath51 gyr ( @xmath52 m@xmath33 , @xmath53 g @xmath54 , and @xmath55 km s@xmath6 at @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is longer than the timescale of the strangulation process for the target galaxy , i.e. , between @xmath42 and 0.1 ( @xmath56 gyr ) .",
    "hence , the khi is not the dominant mechanism of the gas stripping for the target galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the effect of khi is more complicated than our simple estimate .",
    "therefore , our simulation may underestimate the stripping mass .",
    "it is worth noting that at @xmath30 the target galaxy is once again beyond the virial radius of the group , and still has no star formation .",
    "although the target galaxy has consumed its cold gas disk via star formation by @xmath30 , the disk structure of the stellar component is still intact ( fig .",
    "[ fig - evol ] ) .",
    "therefore , the properties of the target galaxy are morphologically similar to those of an s0 galaxy .",
    "thus , we suspect that strangulation may produce a populations of s0 galaxies @xcite in and around poor galaxy groups .",
    "the current simulation suggests it would be interesting to more quantitatively compare a statistical sample of simulated galaxies with observed s0 galaxies in the future .",
    "recent observations of the spiral galaxy ngc  2276 in the ngc  2300 group support our conclusion that strangulation is important in galaxy groups . @xcite have performed a detailed study of this system with _",
    "chandra _ and conclude that ram - pressure stripping is not sufficient to strip the cold gas in the disk .",
    "however , ngc  2276 is losing gas from the hot phase at a rate of @xmath0 5 m@xmath3 yr@xmath6 . given this mass loss rate , the galaxy will likely exhaust its current supply of cold gas within 12 gyr .",
    "similar to what we find for our target galaxy , @xcite conclude that once star formation has ceased , ngc  2276 will have properties similar to an s0 galaxy .",
    "the ngc  2300 group is more massive than the group in our present study .",
    "our results suggest that evidence for strangulation may be found in lower mass systems .",
    "the simulated group is a fairly relaxed system with a dominant central elliptical galaxy .",
    "strangulation is likely to be most effective in dynamically evolved groups because of their enhanced igm .",
    "furthermore , galaxies entering relaxed groups will be subjected to stripping over larger path lengths than galaxies entering dynamically young systems which consist of individual halos and not a common envelope .",
    "the presence of a significant x - ray emitting igm is a good indicator that a group is relaxed @xcite . as nearly all x - ray groups contain a dominant central elliptical galaxy , while systems dominated by spirals tend to be non - detected in x - rays @xcite , strangulation is likely more effective in systems with a central dominant elliptical galaxy .",
    "if true , this might provide an explanation for the recent finding by @xcite that the early - type fraction is higher in systems with an early - type central galaxy than in halos with a late - type central galaxy ( `` galactic conformity '' ) .",
    "the larger sample of the simulated groups in the vgrc will allow us to test this idea .    although this _ letter",
    "_ highlights only one case of strangulation , we are seeing a similar suppression of star formation in other groups in the vgrc . with the large range of properties among the vgrc",
    ", we hope to be able to quantify the importance of strangulation and determine how the suppression of star formation depends on factors such as the galaxy s mass and orbit .",
    "the simulated groups in the vgrc will also allow us to explore the importance of other mechanisms such as galaxy interaction in driving galaxy evolution in groups .",
