    "entanglement has been widely investigated in quantum information processing @xcite and plays important roles in many potential applications , such as quantum communication , quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , entanglement swapping , dense coding , and quantum computing , etc @xcite . moreover , with the recent rapid developments in quantum information , more precise quantifications for entanglement are required to produce , manipulate and detect entanglement states .",
    "most of earlier studies pay much attention to the bipartite systems that start in pure states , which are presently well understood @xcite . while for mixed states ,",
    "the entanglement is difficult to be measured , because it is not easy to define an analog of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "however , it is more significant for studying the systems in mixed states since there does nt exist a system that could be decoupled perfectly from environmental influences for realistic states observed in experiments .",
    "several entanglement measures for mixed states have been proposed , such as the entanglement of formation @xmath0 , the entanglement cost @xmath1 and the distillable entanglement @xmath2 @xcite , but these are not effective computational means . to overcome these shortcomings , peres and horodecki",
    "have proposed a new criterion for separability @xcite . based on this criterion ,",
    "negativity is introduced , which is a good quantity for measuring the entanglement of mixed states @xcite and is equal to absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of density operator with a bipartite mixed state .",
    "there are considerable researches on the dynamics of entanglement for the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite with a mixed state .",
    "the entanglement for the model consisting of a two - level atom interacting with a single mode field through a two - photon process was studied @xcite . in @xcite , the authors devoted to studying the effects of phase damping on the entanglement evolution , where the two - level atom initially in a mixed state interacts with a multi - quanta single mode quantized cavity field including cavity loss .",
    "akhtarshenas and farsi @xcite studied the entanglement of the jcm with the atom initially in mixed state and the field prepared in fock states .",
    "very recently , the entanglement for the jcm with a two - level atom in a lossy cavity was manipulated by a classical driving field @xcite , which was a novel scheme to control the behavior of the entanglement .",
    "xu and co - workers @xcite studied the entanglement dynamics of a three - level atom in @xmath3 configuration , and they found that the maximal value of entanglement decreases with the temperature of the thermal field and can be controlled by the detuning .",
    "zhang and xu @xcite considered the entanglement of jcm interacting with two mode quantized fields for two different initial situations .",
    "@xcite et al studied the entanglement dynamics of two separate jaynes - cummings hamiltonians which consist of two identical two - level atoms inside two separate cavities , respectively .",
    "they investigated how the two sets of pure initial states affected the entanglement dynamics with resonant situations .",
    "the literature @xcite has shown that the pure entangled states are very difficult to obtain due to the interaction of uncontrollable environment and thus the atomic initial state prepared in mixed states is more practical and general . in this paper , we will focus on the problem of a moving two - level atom coupled with a quantized field in a multi - photon transition process .",
    "the effects of the detuning , the transition photon number , atomic motion , the field - mode structure and the temperatures on the entanglement are all discussed .",
    "in fact , the model including all these factors is extremely difficult to deal with using the conventional methods .",
    "here we adopt the algebraic dynamical approach @xcite to study the nonlinear system , and the key idea is introducing a canonical transformation that transforms the hamiltonian into a liner function in terms of a set of lie algebraic generators .",
    "the nonlinear system is thus integrable and solvable , then the density operator with time evolution can be derived easily .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the basic model , and derive the time evolution expression of the density matrix using the algebraic dynamical approach . in section 3 , we study the dynamics evolution of the entanglement between the two subsystems for different situations with the atom initially in a pure state and a mixed state .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section 4 .",
    "we investigate a moving two - level atom interacting with a single mode quantized radiation field in a multi - photon transition process . within the rotating wave approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian of the bipartite system can be described as @xmath5^{l}(a^{\\dagger l}s_{-}+a^{l}s_{+ } )    \\quad(\\hbar=1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath7 is the field frequency .",
    "@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denote the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the radiation field and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) represent the atomic raising ( lowering ) operators .",
    "@xmath12 is the atomic inversion operator .",
    "@xmath13 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "@xmath14 is the shape function of the cavity field mode @xcite and the atomic motion can be incorporated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the atomic motion velocity .",
    "a specific mode @xmath17 is defined : @xmath18 with @xmath19 represents the number of half - wavelengths of the field mode inside a cavity of the length @xmath20 .",
    "when the atomic motion velocity is considered as @xmath21 , the evolution function @xmath22 can be obtain @xmath23^{l}dt'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we restrict the motion of the atom along the z - axis .",
    "there exists one conservative quantity for the system as follow : @xmath24 which commutes with hamiltonian ( 1 ) . to linearize the hamiltonian by the algebraic dynamical approach , a canonical transformation operator is introduced as @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . based on the algebraic dynamical method , su(2 ) algebra generators @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are introduced , with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath36=j_{+},\\quad [ j_{0},j_{-}]=-j_{- } , \\quad [ j_{+},j_{-}]=2j_{0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "then the canonical transformation operator is reduced as @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after the canonical transformation , the dressed hamiltonian can be written in terms of the su(2 ) algebra generators @xmath38 where @xmath39 then the time evolution operator can be expressed by @xmath40u_{g}^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-ie(n)t}[\\cos\\frac{\\lambda t}{2}-2i j_{0}\\sin\\frac{\\lambda t}{2}\\cos 2\\alpha + i(j_{+}+j_{-})\\sin\\frac{\\lambda t}{2}\\sin2\\alpha].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming the cavity field is initially in the single - mode thermal state @xmath41 with @xmath42 $ ] , is the mean photon number of the cavity field for thermal equilibrium at a certain temperature @xmath43 , and the atom is initially in a statistical mixed state @xmath44 with @xmath45+@xmath46=1 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) means the atom is initially prepared in the excited state ( the ground state ) and @xmath49 represents the initial state of the atom is in the mixed state . since there is no system that could be decoupled perfectly from environmental influences and thus mixing is unavoidable , mixed states are more realistic and meaningful than pure states in experimental situation @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the initial state of the total system can be given as @xmath50 using eqs.(10 ) and ( 13 ) , the density operator with the time evolution can be written by @xmath51 where @xmath52|n , g\\rangle\\langle n , g|\\nonumber\\\\ & -&i\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2})\\sin(2\\alpha_{n})[\\cos\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2 } + i\\sin\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2}\\cos(2\\alpha_{n})]|n , g\\rangle\\langle n - l , e|\\nonumber\\\\ & + & i\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2})\\sin(2\\alpha_{n } ) [ \\cos\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2}-i\\sin\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2}\\cos(2\\alpha_{n})]|n - l , e\\rangle\\langle n , g|\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2})\\sin^{2}(2\\alpha_{n})|n - l , e\\rangle\\langle n - l , e|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath53|n , e\\rangle\\langle n , e|\\nonumber\\\\ & -&i\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\sin(2\\alpha_{n+l})[\\cos\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2 } -i\\sin\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2}\\cos(2\\alpha_{n+l})]|n , e\\rangle\\langle n+l , g| \\nonumber\\\\ & + & i\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\sin(2\\alpha_{n+l})[\\cos\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2 } + i\\sin\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2}\\cos(2\\alpha_{n+l})]|n+l , g\\rangle\\langle n , e|\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\sin^{2}(2\\alpha_{n+l})|n+l , g\\rangle\\langle n+l , g|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 .",
    "in this section negativity is employed to investigate the entanglement for the coupled atom - field system .",
    "the system is described by the density matrix in eq.(14 ) , and the entanglement degree is quantified by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the partial transpose of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the trace norm of @xmath58 which is equal to the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath61 is equal to the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath58 , which has been proposed as a quantitative entanglement measure .",
    "it is a good measure of entanglement because negativity is an entanglement monotone , does not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) and can also be easily treated mathematically . from the final state in eq.(14 ) and using eq.(17 ) , the amount of entanglement can be obtained from the following result @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 + c_{e}p_{n - l}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n}t}{2})\\sin^{2}(2\\alpha_{n}),\\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_{n}&=&c_{e}p_{n}[\\cos^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2 } ) + \\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\cos^{2}(2\\alpha_{n+l})]+ c_{g}p_{n+l}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\sin^{2}(2\\alpha_{n+l}),\\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_{n}&=&\\chi^{\\ast}_{n}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i(c_{g}p_{n+l}-c_{e}p_{n})\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2})\\sin(2\\alpha_{n+l } ) [ \\cos\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2}-i\\sin\\frac{\\lambda_{n+l}t}{2}\\cos(2\\alpha_{n+l})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    based on eqs.(17 ) and ( 18 ) , we present some interesting numerical results for different parameters to demonstrate the effects on the entanglement degree . in fig .",
    "1 , the negativity is shown as functions of @xmath46 and the scaled time @xmath64 . when the probability of the atom initially in the ground state is lager , the entanglement is smaller , and the entanglement is close to zero as the value of @xmath46 exceeds 0.5 .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath65 to demonstrate the effects of the parameters on the entanglement . fig .",
    "2 displays the relation between the entanglement and the atomic motion and the field - mode structure . here",
    ", the atomic motion is considered as @xmath21 and is neglected by performing @xmath66 .",
    "it is found that the atomic motion leads to the regular evolution period of the negativity by comparing fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) , and the increasing of @xmath19 shortens the period of the entanglement and results in a slight decreasing of the amplitude in figs .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) ( in fact , when the parameter varies in a small region , the amplitude of the entanglement does nt change a lot ) .",
    "interestingly , when the atom motion is considered and the evolution time is in certain times @xmath67 @xmath68 , the negativity goes to zero which is called  entanglement sudden death \" ( eds ) @xcite and in the other figs , the similar phenomenon also occurs .",
    "now we shall turn our attention to the effects of the detuning .",
    "what is worth noting that most of previous researches only consider the case of the resonance to avoid the complexity . without loss of generality , considering",
    "the detuning is necessary and meaningful . in fig .",
    "3 , it clearly shows that when the detuning increases the entanglement decreases and oscillates fast @xcite , and it is interesting to note that when the detuning and the atomic motion are all considered , a damping evolution of the entanglement arises .",
    "the former is attributed to the fact that on having large dutunings , the atomic system is weakly coupled to the radiation field , and the latter may be referred to a quantum decoherence @xcite when the interaction between the internal and the external atomic dynamics is considered ( see fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "also , it is shown that the atomic motion can lead to a damping in the correlation functions of non classical behaviors between the field and internal atomic variables , which induces the separability of the atom and the field in @xcite .",
    "fig.4 depicts how the average photon number @xmath69 influences the entanglement evolution .",
    "one can see that with increasing the average photon number the negativity decreases , but the evolution periodicity of the entanglement does nt change .",
    "these results show that the maximum value of the entanglement depends on the mean photon number of the field ( or the thermal equilibrium temperature @xmath43 ) , but the period does nt , which agrees well with the results in @xcite . as a matter of fact , for the thermal field , when the average photon number increases , the weight mixture of number states denoted by @xmath70 becomes small , so the entanglement feature is washed out greatly .",
    "in addition , different photon transition processes can also affect the entanglement , as is shown in fig.5 .",
    "intensity of the entanglement increases as the photon number @xmath71 increases , meanwhile the oscillation of the negativity becomes faster and faster @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the realization of the jcm in this paper is not difficult .",
    "we could inject an highly excited rydberg atom along the axis of the cavity which moves fast to eliminate no reflection effect from the cavity , then we could assume that it has a constant velocity along the cavity @xcite",
    ". the transition between the upper and lower levels of the atom may involve @xmath71 photons by adjusting the energy separation between the level close to the energy of @xmath71 quanta of the electromagnetic field .",
    "photons being the fastest information carriers have only very weak coupling to the environment , and are thus the most successful physical system for the observation of multi - partite entanglement and proof - of - principle demonstrations of a diversity of quantum information applications so far .",
    "multi - photon entanglement has become a hot topic recently and we believe the new approach in this paper will promote the relate development .",
    "we have used negativity to study the entanglement for the system of a moving two - level atom interacting with a quantized single mode field in the mixed state with a multi - photon process . with the algebraic dynamical method ,",
    "its solution is obtained . in our work , the atomic motion and the field - mode structure , the detuning , the transition photon number and the average photon number of the field are all considered .",
    "our studies show that increasing of the detuning or the average photon number can lead to decreasing of the negativity , the entanglement oscillates fast for lager detunings and eds appears with certain times .",
    "atomic motion and the field - mode structure also give rise to many interesting effects on the entanglement .",
    "an increase of the parameter @xmath19 can shorten of the evolution periodicity of the entanglement .",
    "importantly , a damping evolution of the entanglement happens when the detuning and the atomic motion are considered together .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the fact that a lager photon number @xmath71 makes it quick to the oscillation of the negativity and bring its amplitude up slightly . our researches might shed light on understanding the entanglement of the jcm and provide a simple means to study dynamics of the entanglement .",
