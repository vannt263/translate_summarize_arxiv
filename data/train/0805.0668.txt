    "the discovery of high - t@xmath2 superconductivity in ln(o@xmath14f@xmath15)feas ( ln= la , ce , pr , nd , sm , gd ) with t@xmath2 @xmath16 25 - 55 k @xcite and high upper critical fields h@xmath17 up to 65  tesla @xcite has spurred a great interest to class of layered oxypnictides ( lno)(mpn ) ( where m=@xmath9 metals , pn = p , as ) .",
    "the observation of high - t@xmath2 superconductivity in these systems is surprising , because the magnetic @xmath9 elements in such a material would be expected to produce magnetic moments that give rise to a long - range ferromagnetic order which would be unfavourable for superconductivity with singlet pairing .",
    "the structure of these superconductors ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is analogous to that which is seen in high - t@xmath2 cuprates , with an feas plane in place of an cuo based plane .",
    "these new superconductors have a layered structure in which the role of the copper oxygen plane in the high - t@xmath2 cuprates is played by the feas plane .",
    "the fe ions are arranged in a simple square lattice , and one can extend the analogy with the cuprate materials to include the supposition that the superconducting mechanism includes electron hopping in the fe lattice and doping from the nearby oxide charge reservoir layer . on the other hand , one can notice some differences : undoped laofeas has a metallic conductivity at room temperature which is opposite to cuprates  correlated insulators .    f@xmath8feas . ]    to understand the electronic structure properties of the new fe - based superconductors and the interplay between the crystal structure and magnetic states , first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) have been performed for the undopedand fluorine doped laofeas @xcite .",
    "most of the lda calculations show a high density of fe-@xmath9-states at the fermi level , whereas the dmft calculation in the paramagnetic phase , including strong - correlation effects beyond lda , shows that for u = 4  ev , a large amount of that spectral weight is shifted away from the fermi level , and the undoped system has a bad metallic behavior @xcite . to date , only one experimental study of the electronic structure of laofeas has been published @xcite ; it presented angle - integrated photoemission spectra showing a a sharp feature very close to the fermi energy and a relative flat distribution of the density of states between 0.5  ev and 3  ev binding energy . in the present study , we examine the resonant x - ray emission spectra ( rxes ) at fe @xmath18-edge and non - resonant oxygen and fluorine @xmath19-emission and absorption spectra of undoped and fluorine doped lnofeas ( ln = la , sm ) , providing an experimental indication of the distribution of fe @xmath9 , o @xmath10 and f @xmath10 occupied and vacant electronic states .",
    "polycrystalline samples with nominal composition smo@xmath14f@xmath15feas ( x=0.05 , 0.15 ) were synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction using high purity smas , smf@xmath20 , fe and fe@xmath21o@xmath20 as starting materials .",
    "smas was obtained by reacting sm chips and as pieces at 600@xmath22  c for 3 hours and then 900@xmath22  c for 5 hours .",
    "the raw materials were thoroughly grounded and pressed into pellets .",
    "the pellets were wrapped into ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "they were then annealed at 1160@xmath22  c for 40 hours . with the exception of the annealing ,",
    "the sample preparation process was carried out in a glove box with a high - purity argon atmosphere .",
    "the synthesis of the lao@xmath14f@xmath15feas ( x=0 , 0.13 ) , is identical except for the substitution of laas and laf@xmath20 in the starting materials . for a more complete description of the sample preparation see ref .  .",
    "the soft x - ray absorption and emission measurements of the fluorine doped laofeas and smofeas were performed at the soft x - ray fluorescence endstation at beamline 8.0.1 of the advanced light source at lawrence berkeley national laboratory @xcite .",
    "the endstation uses a rowland circle geometry x - ray spectrometer with spherical gratings and an area sensitive multichannel detector .",
    "we have measured the resonant and non - resonant fe @xmath23 ( @xmath24 transition ) and non - resonant f @xmath25 and o @xmath25 ( @xmath26 transition ) x - ray emission spectra ( xes ) .",
    "the instrument resolution for f @xmath25 and fe @xmath23 x - ray emission spectra was 0.8  ev and for o @xmath25 xes  0.5  ev .",
    "x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) were measured in the total fluorescence mode with a resolwing power @xmath27=5000 .",
    "all spectra were normalized to the incident photon current using a clean gold mesh in front of the sample to correct for intensity fluctuations in the photon beam .",
    "the excitations for the rxes measurements were determined from the xas spectra ; the chosen energies corresponded to the location of the @xmath13 and @xmath28 thresholds as well as one energy well above resonance .",
    "all band structure calculations were performed within the full - potential augment plane - wave method as implemented in wien2k code @xcite . for the exchange - correlation potential we used gradient approximation @xcite in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof variant .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations were performed with a @xmath29 special point grid and @xmath30=7 ( the product of the smallest of the atomic sphere radii @xmath31 and the plane wave cutoff parameter @xmath32 ) was used for the expansion of the basis set .",
    "the experimentally determined lattice parameters as well as internal positions of laofeas ( a=4.03007   , c=8.7368   ) @xcite were used .",
    "the spheres radii were chosen @xmath33=2.40 , @xmath34=2.13 , @xmath35=2.35 , @xmath36=2.09 and @xmath37=2.09  a.u .",
    "they were chosen in such a way that the spheres are nearly touching . to calculate band structure of lao@xmath38f@xmath39feas we constructed a @xmath40 supercell ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are experimentally determined lattice parameters of lao@xmath43f@xmath44feas @xcite ) in which one of oxygen atoms was replaced by fluorine atom .",
    "the resulting unit cell has a lower symmetry than initial unit cell of laofeas : space group p-4m2 ( 115 ) .",
    "calculations of the electronic structure of lao@xmath38feas were performed for the same crystal structure as for lao@xmath43f@xmath44feas but with a vacancy in place of fluorine atom .",
    "the inclusion of this vacancy in the supercell does not change its symmetry from that of the previous supercell . for the comparison with the experimental spectra",
    "the obtained dos curves were broadened with lorentz functions of width 0.3 ev .",
    "the oxygen k - emission and absorption spectra of undoped laofeas are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "x - ray emission spectrum . ]    the calculated partial density of states ( dos ) of laofeas are are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .        the comparison of experimental oxygen @xmath19-emission and absorption spectra and calculated o @xmath10 dos shows a good correspondence .",
    "as seen , in the vicinity of the fermi level e@xmath45 ( determined as an intersection of o @xmath25 xes and o @xmath46 xas ) the occupied o @xmath10-states are negligible and mostly are concentrated at the middle of the valence band .",
    "o @xmath46 xas shows features at @xmath470.7 , 2.6 and 5.9  ev above the fermi level which can be related to calculated o @xmath10-peaks in the conduction band at 0.9 , 3.3 and 6.0  ev .    in the absence of measurements of xps fe @xmath10-binding energies of laofeas we have determined the fermi level on the fe @xmath13 xes as high - energy edge cut off and using this procedure found that the main spectral weight of fe @xmath13 xes is concentrated at @xmath470.9  ev below e@xmath45 which correlates with metallic behavior of laofeas and a low - energy shoulder at around 3.0  ev below e@xmath45 .",
    "this experimental distribution of fe @xmath9-states corresponds to our lda electronic structure calculation ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and is in contradiction with calculated dmft density of states @xcite according to which the main weight of fe @xmath9-states is shifted to approximately 4  ev below the ef forming low hubbard @xmath9-band and quasiparticle peak near the fermi level .",
    "the recent lda+dmft(qmc ) study of laofeas also show that laofeas is far from the strongly correlated regime @xcite .",
    "the recent observation of high - t@xmath2 superconductivity with t@xmath2=31 - 55  k for undoped oxygen deficient lno@xmath5feas ( ln = la , ce , pr , nd , sm ) @xcite suggest that the effect of fluorine doping in these samples may be related to the oxygen vacancy effect .",
    "the calculated electronic structures of laofeas , nonstoichiometric lao@xmath7fea , and fluorine doped lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     and",
    "o @xmath10 doses of laofeas la , lao@xmath7feas and lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas . ]    f@xmath15ofeas ( x=0.05 , 0.15 ) . ]    the o 2p - band of oxygen deficient and fluorine doped laofeas is narrower than undoped one , whereas the fe @xmath9-states remain essentially unchanged .",
    "we need to point out that o @xmath10 dos for the same level of oxygen deficiency or fluorine doping ( 12.5% ) is found to be the same . assuming that the carriers in the feas reservoir layer are provided by the oxygen vacancies",
    ", it can be inferred that the substitution of fluorine in the oxygen sites produces the same effect which is seen in reduction of o @xmath10 band width .",
    "the reduction of calculated o @xmath10 band width of fluorine doped laofeas with respect to undoped compound is confirmed by direct measurements of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the o @xmath25 xes for fluorine - doped smofeas ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the resonant excitation of fe @xmath23 xes at @xmath13-threshold selectively excites the fe @xmath13- xes , eliminating the contribution from the fe @xmath28 xes and allowing for a more clear evaluation of the effects of fluorine - doping on the fe @xmath9-states to be made . in agreement with the calculations of the electronic structure , the fe @xmath13 emission of the laofeas and smofeas compounds ( fig .  [ fig7 ] )",
    "are unchanged as a result of the doping .",
    "dos of lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas . ]     rxes ( lower panel ) and calculated fe @xmath9 dos of undoped and fluorine doped feas superconductors . ]",
    "the experimental f @xmath25 xes ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) and calculated f @xmath10 dos ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) show that f @xmath10-states are located about 9.1 and 8.2  ev below the fermi level , respectively , and not mixed with fe @xmath9 and o @xmath10-states .",
    "therefore the role of f @xmath10-states seems to provide the necessary amount of electron carriers to feas - layer . in agreement with the calculations of the electronic structure , the fe @xmath13 emission of the laofeas and smofeas compounds ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) are unchanged as a result of the doping .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the electronic structure of undoped , oxygen deficient and fluorine doped feas superconduictors by rixs measurements and _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "the resonantly excited fe @xmath13 x - ray emission spectra show that occupied fe @xmath9-dos has two - peaks structure with the main peak formed by pure fe @xmath9-states and located at @xmath471.0  ev below the fermi level and low - energy subband at @xmath473.0  ev with respect to e@xmath45 which is due to hybridization of fe @xmath9-states with o @xmath10 ( as @xmath11 - la @xmath12 ) states .",
    "these results are in a good agreement with our fp lapw electronic structure calculations .",
    "we have not found the features predicted by dmft calculations : low hubbard @xmath9-band below e@xmath45 for about @xmath474  ev and quasiparticle peak at the fermi level and therefore we conclude that the feas - type superconductors are not strongly correlated systems .",
    "electronic structure calculations performed for lao@xmath5feas and lao@xmath5f@xmath6feas show the identical results for the same level of oxygen deficiency or fluorine doping : unchanged fe @xmath9-dos and reduced band width of o @xmath10-band .",
    "the reduction of width of o @xmath10-band under f - doping is confirmed by direct measurements of o @xmath25 xes of smo@xmath5f@xmath6feas .",
    "therefore the role of oxygen vacancies and fluorine doping seems to be the same - to form oxide charge reservoir layer and supply feas planes by carriers which are necessary for occurrence of the same superconducting properties .",
    "this situation reminds fluorine doping in cuprates which gives the similar results .",
