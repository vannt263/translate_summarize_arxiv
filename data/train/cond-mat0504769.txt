    "the discovery of the c@xmath4 fullerene@xcite and the remarkable physical and chemical properties resulting from its unique topology and electronic structure have motivated an extraordinary research activity in past years.@xcite one of the recent questions of interest in this field is the possibility of producing even smaller c or si cagelike clusters and to synthesize novel solids using them as building blocks .",
    "thus , several experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in order to elucidate the complex mechanisms of formation of these nanostructures.@xcite in the particular case of c@xmath0 , which is expected to be the smallest fullerene , experiments indicate that the dominant species in laser - vaporization of graphite are ring structures , while theory yields different isomers depending on the calculation method.@xcite hartree - fock ( hf ) studies predict that the ring is the lowest - energy isomer , followed by the bowl ( a substructure of the c@xmath4 fullerene ) and then by the dodecahedral cage.@xcite in contrast , the local density approximation ( lda ) to density - functional theory ( dft ) yields the cage to be more stable than the bowl and the ring , whereas in a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) the same ordering as hf is obtained.@xcite these investigations , as well as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations,@xcite indicate that non - trivial electron correlation effects play a central role in the structural and electronic properties of these nanoclusters .",
    "recently , prinzbach and coworkers succeeded to produce the cage - structured fullerene c@xmath0 in the gas phase starting from the perhydrogenated form c@xmath0h@xmath0.@xcite this isomer , which is not formed spontaneously in carbon condensation or cluster annealing processes , has a sufficiently long lifetime . moreover , photoelectron spectrum ( pes ) measurements have been performed from which its cage - like structure has been inferred.@xcite theoretical studies by saito and miyamoto have reproduced the pes thereby confirming the structure assignment given in experiment.@xcite in addition , experimental evidence has been provided on the oligomerization of c@xmath0 fullerenes@xcite and on the formation of a solid phase of c@xmath0 dodecahedra@xcite which , unlike c@xmath4 solids , involve strong c - c bonds between the pentagons of neighboring units .",
    "besides its experimental realization , the topology of c@xmath0 appears to be a particularly attractive physical situation for theoretical investigations of correlated itinerant electrons in cagelike clusters with pentagonal rings .",
    "similar studies on c@xmath5 and c@xmath4 clusters have already been performed in relation to alkali - metal - doped c@xmath4 solids like k@xmath6c@xmath4 and rb@xmath7c@xmath4,@xcite since one expects that the basic physics behind the superconducting and optical properties of these materials should be captured at the scale of an individual molecular constituent .",
    "the smaller fullerenes have attracted a special attention in this context due to the perspective of achieving larger superconducting transition temperatures than the c@xmath4-based solids .",
    "indeed , a number of theoretical investigations predict a significant enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling as the size of the fullerene is reduced from c@xmath4 to c@xmath8 , c@xmath9 , and finally c@xmath0.@xcite consequently , theoretical studies aiming at understanding the properties of correlated electrons in small fullerene clusters are of considerable interest .",
    "lattice models have been used to determine low - energy properties of c@xmath4 which derive from the outermost half - filled @xmath10-electron cloud . in particular ,",
    "the spin - density distribution on the buckyball has been analyzed in a series of papers.@xcite coffey and trugman@xcite calculated the ground - state spin configuration using a classical antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg hamiltonian corresponding to the strongly correlated limit of the hubbard model .",
    "they found that the lowest - energy spin structure shows a nontrivial noncollinear order which minimizes magnetic frustrations within each pentagonal ring , keeping strong af short - range order in bonds connecting nearest neighbor ( nn ) pentagons.@xcite the spin structure in c@xmath4 was also investigated by means of hubbard or pariser - parr - pople hamiltonians at half - band filling , taking into account on - site and inter - site coulomb interactions within the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) approximation.@xcite a common result of these investigations is the presence of a magnetic instability for a critical value @xmath11 of the on - site coulomb repulsion yielding a magnetic order which resembles that of the classical af heisenberg model .",
    "in addition remarkable noncollinear spin arrangements and charge - density redistributions have been obtained in mean - field calculations as a function of electron and hole doping.@xcite qmc simulations on c@xmath4 at half - band filling and exact diagonalization studies of cagelike c@xmath5 support the existence of non - vanishing short - range spin correlations.@xcite however , it should be recalled that there is no experimental evidence for an spontaneous symmetry breaking . instead",
    ", the spin - density - wave instability should be interpreted as an indication of fluctuating spin - spin correlations within the cluster .",
    "it is therefore interesting to improve on the treatment of correlations in order to quantify the possible effects of artificial symmetry breakings on the electronic properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the ground - state properties of correlated electrons on a c@xmath0 cagelike cluster by using the hubbard hamiltonian and a recently developed lattice density - functional theory ( ldft).@xcite previous applications of this approach to 1d and 2d lattices have yield quite accurate ground - state properties for all band fillings and interaction regimes .",
    "a particularly interesting feature in the present context is that ldft does not necessarily involve a symmetry breaking in order to account for the effects of electron correlation and localization in the strongly interacting limit.@xcite thus , it appears as an appropriate means of improving on uhf calculations .",
    "moreover , besides the aspects specifically related to c@xmath0 and its topology , the present calculations should be of interest as a finite cluster application of new density - functional approaches to lattice fermion models.@xcite    the body of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .

    "the symmetry of these bonds is actually different despite the fact that all sites are equivalent .",
    "the interaction - energy functional should be generalized following previous works on dimerized 1d chains.@xcite the domain of representability of @xmath24 and the accuracy of the scaling hypothesis could be explicitly tested for smaller similar clusters like c@xmath5 by solving levy s constrained search.@xcite furthermore , the functional dependence of @xmath34 for low - symmetry clusters deserves to be explored by taking into account charge transfers and eventual redistributions of the spin density between non - equivalent sites .",
