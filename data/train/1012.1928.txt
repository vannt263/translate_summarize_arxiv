    "the basic notion of superconductivity as a cooperative phenomenon is the superconducting order parameter .",

    "the electronic condensate of a superconductor can move without friction , manifesting itself as a current without joule dissipation .",
    "the density of a non - dissipative current ( supercurrent ) is proportional to the phase gradient of the macroscopic wave function ; its amplitude is constant along the wire . at fixed gradient , phase is a linear function of the coordinate along the wire . for a long wire ,",
    "the phase difference between the wire s ends may exceed , by many orders of magnitude , the basic period @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is inconsistent with the thermodynamics of a superconductor , as its free energy is a @xmath2-periodic function of the phase difference .",
    "thus , the equilibrium current reaches a maximum at a phase difference of @xmath3 and then oscillates with a further increase of phase difference .    in a narrow wire ( thinner than the coherence length ) , the adjustment of the supercurrent to the equilibrium value is achieved by the transient processes of @xmath2 phase - slips ( ps ) of the macroscopic wave function  halperinphaseslipsreview . as the wire becomes thinner ,",
    "the phase - slips occur more frequently .",
    "furthermore , at low temperature and for sufficiently small wire diameters , quantum phase - slips ( qps ) take over the thermally activated ones , leading to an activationless relaxation of supercurrent  zaikin97 .",
    "it is important to notice that the conditions of the continuity and single - valuedness of the macroscopic wave function allow a @xmath4 discontinuity of its phase at any point @xmath5 along the wire ( here @xmath6 are integers ) . at fixed phase difference between the ends of the wire , an observable quantity , such as current ,",
    "depends on @xmath7 , but is independent of the specific locations @xmath5 .",
    "this is why @xmath8 can be used to label different quantum states of the condensate .",
    "a @xmath9-phase slip , occurring at some point along the wire , changes the value of @xmath8 by @xmath10 . because the state of the wire is characterized by @xmath7 rather than by each @xmath6 separately , _ any _ of these @xmath9-qps results in the transition @xmath11 .",
    "the qps processes a priori do not have to be dissipative  @xcite . in the absence of dissipation , qps happening at different points along the wire",
    "interfere with each other  @xcite .",
    "the resulting superpositions of qps depend on the distribution of the electric charge along the wire due to aharonov - casher effect  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these spatially interfereing qps as _ coherent _ quantum phase - slips ( cqps ) .    the thinner the wire , the larger the amplitude of cqps and quantum uncertainty of @xmath8 are .",
    "proliferation of cqps destroys superconductivity in ultra - thin long wires in the following sense : the equilibrium maximum supercurrent ( prescribed by the periodic phase dependence of the free energy ) decreases exponentially with the increasing length of the wire  mlg2002 , rather than being inversely proportional to it . in general , cqps are considered to be the precursors of the superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition  @xcite . moreover , in josephson networks with special symmetries , cqps were predicted to give rise to the topologically non - trivial quantum collective order  doucotvidal2002,ioffefeigelman2002 . on a practical side , challenging , but ultimately achievable control of external dissipation promises realization of a fundamental current standard by bloch oscillations induced by cqps  averinzorinlikharev , haviland2000 , buchler2004 , mooijnazarov2006 .    in spite of their conceptual and practical importance",

    "such experiments , while providing evidence for quantum - mechanical effects , can not reveal the coherent aspects of quantum phase - slips and are likely to suffer from uncontrolled dissipation in the electromagnetic environment of the biasing circuitry .",
    "phase - biased chains of a few josephson junctions exhibit suppression of maximum supercurrent consistent with the cqps theorygladchenko2009,pop2010 , but have so far not displayed the expected spectrum of excitations associated with the quantum dynamics of phase - slips .",
    "proposals for non - dissipative experiments with nanowires undergoing cqps in the flux - qubit setup  @xcite require a narrow range of quantum phase - slip amplitudes corresponding to transition frequencies of the order of a few  @xmath15 .",
    "such experimental strategy appears feasible , but it may be complicated by the fact that phase - slip amplitudes of realistic wires vary by many orders of magnitude in view of their predicted exponential sensitivity to the wire transverse dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe an evidence for the coherent quantum phase - slips in a long array of @xmath16 josephson junctions , which emulates a nanowire .",
    "our experiment on cqps features two important distinctions .",
    "first , for a faithful emulation of a nanowire , two parameters of the array are crucial : it must be long ( comprising many junctions ) and the probability amplitude of a phase - slip in a single junction must be small .",
    "these conditions minimize the effect of the discrete nature of the lumped circuit , and make the dynamics of condensate phase in the array similar to its counterpart in a wire .",
    "second , to detect the presence of cqps in our array , we take advantage of the sensitivity of the fluxonium qubit@xcite transitions to the phase - slips in its array inductance , which we treat as a slippery superconducting wire .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section2 ] of this paper",
    "we describe , both qualitatively and quantitatively , how the spectrum of fluxonium qubit is modified by the presence of cqps in the qubit inductance . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we describe the experimental evidence of cqps in the qubit inductance by comparing to the theory both frequency - domain and time - domain measurements of the fluxonium transitions .",
    "appendix a provides details of our experimental techniques , appendix b supports our theory and data analysis .",
    "fluxonium qubit ( fig .",
