    "nowadays there is wide consensus that most if not all nearby early type galaxies host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their centers ( see for a recent review ferrarese 2006 ) . however",
    "a direct determination of the bh mass ( @xmath6 ) is possible only for a limited number of inactive galaxies in the local universe , from dynamical methods ( virial theorem ) based on the observations of the kinematics of stars orbiting around the smbh .",
    "an extension of this method to higher redshift objects is viable only for active galaxies , where @xmath6 can be derived from the dynamics of gas gravitationally bound to the smbh : this is the usual case of regions emitting the broad emission lines ( blr ) .    at low redshift correlations between @xmath6 and the global properties of the host galaxies , namely the luminosity ( @xmath7 ) and the central velocity dispersion of the bulge ,",
    "have been found .",
    "locally therefore the measure of the properties of the host galaxy is an alternative method for evaluating @xmath6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the mass determinations through the virial method and through the global parameters of the hosts of close  by quasars . for qsos",
    "it is very difficult to measure the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulge , so one must rely on the @xmath8 relationship . for nearby ellipticals ,",
    "there is increasing evidence that this relation has the same behavior for both inactive and active galaxies ( see for example merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 , 2002 ; bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) , notwithstanding a substantial increase of the dispersion in the latter case , possibly due to the greater difficulty in the determination of all the parameters .",
    "moreover , agn hosts and inactive galaxies appear substantially the same objects , as indicated by direct morphological studies ( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "this is consistent with a picture where the agn phenomenon , which is linked to the gas accretion on the central bh , would be a phase characterizing the life of normal galaxies in particular during major mergers ( see for example kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) . for these reasons , in this work we start with the assumption that the correlation established for nearby galaxies is also valid for higher redshift qsos , provided that host galaxy luminosity is corrected for galactic evolution to @xmath9 .",
    "a second set of qso bh mass determinations can be obtained through the virial theorem , provided that an estimate of the velocity @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 of the blr is available .",
    "the blr velocity can be derived from the fwhm of the broad emission lines if one assumes a value for the geometrical factor @xmath12 , which is an unknown parameter of order unity linked to the geometry of the blr .",
    "the measurement of @xmath11 may require cumbersome procedures , like reverberation mapping ( ulrich et al .",
    "1984 ; blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 2001 ) , that uses the continuum source variability to evaluate time delays between the central emission and the blr gas response ; an alternative is to infer the blr size from the ionizing luminosity with which it is correlated ( kaspi et al .  2000 ;",
    "vestergaard 2002 ; pian , falomo & treves 2005 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "bh mass determinations can be then derived from a measure of the broad line widths and of the ionizing continuum intensity , once the value of the geometrical factor is fixed .    in the next section we focus on the quasar sample choice and on the data collection and analysis ( [ secima][secspe ] ) . in section [ secmas ]",
    "we describe the formulae used for applying the two methods of mass determination ( [ secpho][secvir ] ) and report on the results ( [ seccomp ] ) .",
    "this analysis constrains the value of the geometrical factor .",
    "the issue of the blr geometry and orientation is further discussed in paragraph [ calcolof ] . in section [ secsum ] our results",
    "are compared with those of literature and discussed within the unified model of agn .    throughout this paper , we adopt a concordant cosmology with @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . we have converted the results of other authors to this cosmology when adopting their relations and using their data .",
    "we selected all qsos from the veron ",
    "cetty & veron ( 2003 ) catalogue , for which _ hst _ images and spectra are available .",
    "we further require that the images have exposure times longer than 1000  s and that spectra cover the range 14001700   ( @xmath17 band ) .",
    "in addition we selected only objects hosted by ellipticals , so that the bulge component substantially coincides with the whole galaxy .",
    "the resulting sample includes 29 objects at @xmath180.6 , 17 of which are radio loud ( rlq ) and 12 are radio quiet ( rqq ) .",
    "the main properties of the objects are listed in table 1 .",
    "the sample is essentially uniformly distributed in redshift ( see fig .  [ zdistrib ] ) .                in table 5",
    "we report the journal of observations for the two objects without available measurement of the host galaxy from the literature .",
    "a two  dimensional analysis has been carried out using aida ( astronomical image decomposition and analysis , uslenghi & falomo 2006 , in preparation ; see also kotilainen et al .",
    "2005 ) , a software package specifically designed to perform two dimensional model fitting of qso images , providing simultaneous decomposition into the nuclear and host galaxy components .",
    "psf modelling is by far the most critical step of analysing qso host galaxies . for hst images , the software package tinytim ( krist & hook 1997 ) can produce a psf model that is very accurate in the inner part ( up to 12  ) but it does not properly model the external fainter halo produced by the scattered light ( e.g. scarpa et al .",
    "2000 ) . to account for this",
    "we therefore modelled the external part by adding an exponential term to the tinytim psf .",
    "the parameters of these components have been evaluated by fitting the psf model to a number of stars in the field .    for each qso",
    "we have then applied a mask to exclude possible contamination from spurious sources , bad pixels , companions and other defects affecting the image .",
    "the background was estimated from the signal computed in a circular annulus centered on the object and its uncertainty obtained from the comparison of the values computed in annuli at different radii .",
    "the masked qso images were finally fitted with a model including both a point source and the host galaxy assuming a de vaucouleurs law convolved with the psf .",
    "the results of the best fit parameters are reported in table 5 .",
    "a fit with a disc galaxy yielded significant poorer results , consistently with the high luminosity of the nucleus ( see dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) . in fig .",
    "[ rp ] we show the qsos images and residuals .",
    "the radial profiles of the images , of the psf , of the galaxy and of the best ",
    "fitting models for the 2 objects are also shown ."
