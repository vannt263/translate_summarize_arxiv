    "two of us@xcite have recently proposed the possibility of realizing nearly dissipationless collective spin currents in easy - plane thin - film ferromagnets .",

    "thinking in this way we can see directly that the point @xmath77 , for which we found in the previous section that the condensation energy is maximal and the total spin supercurrent is zero , is special .",
    "the reason is that the contribution of each `` cooper pair '' is neutralized by that of another pair with reversed wave vectors for both electron and the hole .",
    "two classes of helimagnets have been extensively studied in the past . the first is comprised of mnsi and related materials that have long - period helical ground states because of the dzyaloshinskii@xcite instability of ferromagnetism in systems without inversion symmetry .",
    "these systems have been studied extensively very recently@xcite because they provide an example of an itinerant - electron magnetic system in which the ordering temperature can conveniently be driven to zero by applying pressure , and because they appear to show non - fermi - liquid behavior associated with this nearby quantum critical point .",
    "they also have the potential advantage for the phenomenon of interest here that the chirality degeneracy , present in the microscopic model studied in section ii for example , is lifted@xcite by broken inversion symmetry . in this case",
    "however , the plane of the spiral magnetic order is fixed only indirectly by anisotropy in the gradient term in the landau - ginzburg energy functional and the easy plane anisotropy that we require is rather weak .",
    "the second class of materials consists of the heavy metals tb , dy , and ho which have helical ground states due to frustration induced by rkky interactions between the rare - earth moments and do have strong easy - plane anisotropy.@xcite at present , it appears to us that these are the most promising materials for the realization of persistent spin currents .    in the case of a superconductor ,",

    "spin supercurrents can be generated by biasing the systems with an external spin current .",
    "one possible scheme for realizing such a bias using four ferromagnetic contacts is discussed in ref .  , but its success depends on avoiding spin - flip processes at the interfaces and on having thin - film samples with spin - diffusion lengths that are larger than the sample size . for systems with a spirally - ordered ground state , however , there is an easier and more straightforward way of generating persistent spin currents which does not depend on achieving spin - current biasing . instead , persistent spin currents can be generated in the ground state of the system simply by applying a magnetic field in the plane defined by the spiral order parameter . in the continuum model that we study ,",
    "the persistent - current state in a helimagnet is a soliton - lattice state for which the lattice bloch wavevector is not a good quantum number .",
    "for this reason we can not easily describe these states microscopically .",
    "we therefore use a phenomenological model for the following discussion .",
    "a magnetic field in the @xmath78-@xmath79 plane alters the spiral state . at sufficiently large field strengths ,",
    "it is clear that the magnetic field will lead to nearly uniform spin - polarization along the field direction . as we show , for fields below a critical strength , the spiral state is driven by the field to a soliton - lattice state , in which the magnetization orientation slips periodically from the field - direction orientation .",

    "we choose the inplane magnetic field along the @xmath70 direction , @xmath91 .",
    "for this particular choice of directions , @xmath84 is the angle between the local magnetization direction and the external magnetic field .",
    "this model for a spiral state in an external field ( eq .  ( [ eq : pt ] ) ) is equivalent to the pokrovsky - talapov ( pt ) model , reviewed for example by p.  bak,@xcite used originally to model commensurate - incommensurate transitions and more recently to model the influence of an in - plane field on spontaneous coherence broken symmetry states in bilayer quantum hall systems . in using this model",
    "we assume that the energy density depends on the gradient of the orientation angle @xmath84 and that , for qualitative purposes , we can expand around the value of the gradient that minimizes the energy density .",
    "this chiral model favors a particular sign for @xmath92 and does not account for the symmetry - based expectation that the energy density will have minima for @xmath93 .",
    "hence it accounts only for the effect of a magnetic field on a spiral state domain with a particular chirality ; we speculate later on persistent spin currents near boundaries between domains with opposite chirality . a more general model of the gradient energy that does not favor a particular chirality",
    "would have the form @xmath94 $ ] plus a constant .",

    "indeed , magnetoelastic coupling is known to play an important and complex role@xcite in the response of helimagnets to external magnetic fields . our use of a chiral continuum model for the following discussion certainly does not capture the full richness of real helimagnets in external magnetic fields .",

    "current spintronic devices make use of magnetotransport effects like anisotropic magnetoresistance , giant magnetoresistance,@xcite and tunnel magnetoresistance,@xcite all of which follow from the dependence of quasiparticle transport on the collective magnetic state .",
    "the effect we have discussed here is distinctly different in that it is an equilibrium spin current that is carried collectively rather than by quasiparticles .    to illustrate the possibility of realizing interesting magnetotransport effects based on field - induced persistent currents in helimagnets ,",
    "consider the case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] .",
    "we consider current flow along a ferromagnetic wire which contains a helimagnet . the magnetization direction in the ferromagnets",
    "is assumed to be aligned along the direction of the wire by magnetostatic energy , and the electrical current in the ferromagnet will be spin - polarized along the direction of the magnetization .",
    "we also assume that the helimagnet is grown so that it has its wavevector along the wire direction and the spiral magnetization is in the perpendicular plane ; this would be the case for example for rare earth metal single - crystal helimagnets with their hcp c - axis aligned with the wire .",
    "the quasiparticles of the helimagnet would then tend to have their spins aligned in the plane perpendicular to the wire axis , suppressing their ability to carry currents that are spin - polarized along the wire axis , and increasing the resistance of the overall system . in the presence of a field perpendicular to the wire axis , however , the helimagnet would have a persistent spin current polarized along the wire axis , eliminating the need to carry the spin current with quasiparticles .",
    "we predict that because of the persistent spin currents , an in - plane field could therefore alter the resistance of this system . since the persistent spin current has a sign that depends on the chirality of the spiral , the sign of the resistance depends on this quantity .",

    "this same effect could also be of interest in a similar setup where the helimagnet is connected to normal metallic leads .",
    "then the spin current in the helimagnet results in a different resistance for the electron spins entering from the leads .",
    "in this fashion the helimagnet could act as a tunable spin filter which is controlled by an external magnetic field .",
    "it may also be possible to realize spin torque@xcite effects in helimagnets that are distinct from those which occur in ferromagnets .",
    "spin torque occurs when the spin polarization of a quasiparticle current changes with position by altering the spin distribution of current - carrying states , transferring the spin carried by the quasiparticle to the collective magnetic coordinate .",
    "the field - induced persistent spin current in a helimagnet will have a strong spatial dependence , a sign change in fact , near a boundary surface between domains with opposite chirality .",
    "the divergence of this spin current makes a contribution to the time - dependent spin polarization that is cancelled by the torque due to the external magnetic field when the domain wall is in equilibrium .",
    "when the domain wall is not in equilibrium , for example by being displaced from a pinning center , these two contributions will not cancel and the net torque will lead to a time - dependent magnetization orientation .",
    "conversely , the equilibrium position of a pinned domain wall will be sensitive to the presence of persistent currents and will therefore be altered by an in - plane field .    in conclusion",

    "we have demonstrated the possibility of dissipationless spin currents in states with equilibrium quasiparticle populations .",
    "these spin currents are always associated with spiral magnetic order . on the other hand , the existence of spiral magnetic order is , in general , not sufficient to guarantee collective spin transport . in particular helimagnets , which have spiral ground states , do not support persistent spin currents .",
    "however , persistent spin currents can be induced in these systems simply by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions with martin bnsager , herbert capellmann , jan martinek , herbert schoeller , michael steinitz and leo radzihovsky .",
    "the work is part of the cfn which is supported by the dfg .",
    "we acknowledge funding by the european training network rtn2 - 2001 - 00440 and by the dfg - emmy - noether - program ko1987/2 .",
    "work at the university of texas was supported by the welch foundation and by the doe under grant de - fg03 - 02er45958 .",
    "in order to prove that the spin - current density is related to the derivative of the total energy with respect to the wave vector @xmath4 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : curdens ] ) we extend the hartree - fock hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft ] ) by formally introducing an additional parameter @xmath142 via the replacement @xmath143 and @xmath144 . our original hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft ] ) corresponds to @xmath145 .",
    "the quasiparticle ground state for given @xmath18 and @xmath146 is an eigenstate and , therefore , the hellmann - feynman theorem applies , @xmath147 by comparing the r.h.s with eq .",
    "( [ eq : defj ] ) we find that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hellmann ] ) equals to @xmath148 . to evaluate the l.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hellmann ] ) we observe that the quasiparticle energies @xmath45 for @xmath149 as well as the value of @xmath150 depend on @xmath18 and @xmath146 only in the combination @xmath151 . as a consequence , we can replace @xmath152 by @xmath153 .",
    "together with @xmath154 , this immediately proves eq .",
