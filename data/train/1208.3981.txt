    "we consider a dynamical system whose state is a diffusion process governed by a linear it@xmath1 stochastic differential equation ( sde ) driven by a random noise .",

    "a nonzero drift in the noise sde can be interpreted as the strategy of a hypothetical player who uses the past history of the system state in order to move its probability density function ( pdf ) away from the _ nominal invariant state pdf_. the deviation of the actual noise distribution from the wiener measure can be quantified by the kullback - leibler relative entropy @xcite . as a measure of uncertainty in the noise distribution , the relative entropy is often utilized in the robust control of stochastic systems @xcite .    the _ noise relative entropy _ over a bounded time interval can be regarded as a stochastic analogue of the supply which is a fundamental concept in the theory of deterministic dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "this analogy leads to a _ dissipation inequality _ which links the noise relative entropy supply with the increment in the relative entropy of the state pdf of the system with respect to the nominal invariant state pdf .",
    "the _ state relative entropy _ , therefore , plays the role of a _",
    "storage function_. the relative entropy dissipation inequality is related to jarzynski s equality @xcite for the helmholtz free energy in open dynamical systems .",
    "this non - equilibrium thermodynamics viewpoint , where the noise results from interaction of the system with its surroundings ( via mechanical work and heat transfer ) , motivates a stochastic dissipativity theory in the form of a variational problem involving entropy .",
    "such problems are more complex than their deterministic counterparts since they deal with probability measures ( or pdfs ) on signal spaces , rather than the signals themselves .",
    "we are mainly concerned with computing the minimum noise relative entropy supply required to drive the system between given initial and terminal state pdfs over a specified time horizon . the _ state pdf transition problem _ , known as the schrdinger bridge ,",
    "was treated previously in a context of reciprocal processes ( markov random fields on the time axis ) @xcite .",

    "we consider the state pdf transition problem with gaussian initial and terminal state pdfs and undertake a different , somewhat more algebraic , approach . using markovization and stochastic linearization of the noise strategy as entropy - decreasing operations ,",
    "we establish a mean - covariance separation principle which splits the minimum required noise relative entropy supply into two independent terms associated with the mean and covariance matrix of the system state . while the _ mean _ part is calculated using standard linear quadratic optimization , the _ covariance _ part ( which is a function of matrices ) satisfies a hamilton - jacobi equation ( hje ) complicated by inherent noncommutativity .    this partial differential equation ( pde ) has a quadratic hamiltonian on its right - hand side ( with the quadraticity coming from the diffusion part of the system dynamics ) and involves a certain boundary condition . the bilinear `` interaction '' of solutions of this pde ( which , in the quadratic case , replaces the superposition principle )",
    "allows them to be generated in a quasi - additive way . unlike infinitesimal perturbation techniques based on asymptotic expansions in the small noise limit",
    ", our approach provides a _",
    "finite _ correction scheme which allows a closed - form smooth solution to be found for the hje .",
    "the correction scheme also employs an ansatz class of `` trace - analytic '' functions of matrices and a matrix version of the separation of variables which not only copes with the nonlinearity but also essentially `` scalarizes '' the covariance hje , thus overcoming the noncommutativity issues .",
