    "the star hd 101584 ( @xmath6 ) is classified as a 7.01 visual magnitude f0iape with @xmath7 ( hoffleit 1983 ) , indicating an effective temperature of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and thus @xmath10 ( landolt - brnstein 1982 ) .",
    "far- and near - infrared photometry reveals a strong infrared source at the position of the star ( humphreys & ney 1974 ; parthasarathy & pottasch 1986 ) .",
    "molecular line observations show bipolar outflow for the oh maser ( te lintel hekkert et al .",
    "1992 ) and a very complex structure for the @xmath11 transition ( trams et al . 1990 ; loup et al . 1990 ; van der veen et al .",
    "the molecular line emission in oh and co is normally discussed in terms of evolved stars , and fits the idea that hd 101584 is a post - agb star .",
    "the first to classify the star hd 101584 as a post - agb star were parthasarathy & pottasch ( 1986 ) .",
    "their conclusion was based on the strong infrared excess of the star which seems to be due to a large amount of dust around the star .",
    "an extensive study by trams et al .",
    "( 1991 ) shows the resemblance of the infrared excess of hd 101584 with other known post - agb stars .",
    "it is now reasonably well established that hd 101584 is a post - agb star .",
    "the low resolution iue spectra ( @xmath12 ) of hd 101584 , a a7i and a f0i standard star are shown in figure  [ lhlfig - lores ] . before fitting the ultraviolet energy distribution to a standard star",
    "the spectrum was smoothed over @xmath13 and corrected for interstellar and circumstellar extinction ( mathis 1990 ) using a colour excess , @xmath14 , derived for spectral type a7i .",
    "the low resolution ultraviolet spectrum was best fitted to the standard a7i star , hd14873 .",
    "an even better fit is possible if also an a6i star would be available in the reference atlas ( heck et al .",
    "the spectrum of hd 101584 shows no flux lower then @xmath15 and can therefore not be fitted with a spectrum of a star of spectral type a5i or hotter .    by comparing the spectrum of hd 101584 with the standard f0i star , @xmath16",
    ", an excess of flux for the program star between @xmath17 indicates a higher temperature of the star .",
    "the slope of the continuum of the spectrum confirms the supergiant nature of the star .",
    "the data on the spectrum of hd 101584 and on the two reference stars is in table  [ lhltab - lowspec ] .",
