    "we derive the exact analytical expression for the casimir interaction in media - separated cylindrical configurations , including eccentric cylinders and the cylinder - plane geometry . for simplicity , we consider in this work the case of a quantum real scalar field satisfying usual boundary conditions on the interfaces .",
    "our approach is a generalization of our previous work on the electromagnetic casimir interaction in cylindrical geometries with perfect reflectors @xcite to the case of dielectric media , and is based on the computation of the casimir energy as a sum of the zero - point eigenfrequencies of the three - media geometry .",
    "we should note that this approach requires the notion of _ real _ zero - point energies , and therefore the three media should have negligible absorption in the whole range of frequencies relevant for the casimir interaction .",
    "the case of absorbing media can be considered with alternative techniques @xcite .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field @xmath0 in the presence of two parallel , eccentric dielectric cylinders of radii @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and length @xmath4 separated by a fluid . the eccentricity ( i.e. the distance between the centers of the cylinders )",

    "the main difference with that calculation is the presence of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , both of which are equal to unity in the perfectly reflecting case .",
    "following the same procedure as in @xcite , the interaction energy can be written as    @xmath85    where the matrix elements of @xmath86 are @xmath87 the functions @xmath88 are the analytic continuation of the functions @xmath89 to imaginary frequencies @xmath90 : @xmath91 and @xmath92    in order to derive this result we enclosed the system into a large cylinder , alternatively one can deal with the unbounded configuration following the approach described in ref.@xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we study the condition for the crossover from attractive to repulsive interaction . for simplicity , we concentrate ourselves on the case of concentric cylinders . in the particular case of @xmath93",

    "therefore , the sign of @xmath96 is determined by the numerator @xmath107 , that can be written as    @xmath108    where @xmath109 .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that @xmath110 is an increasing function of @xmath111 .",
    "therefore @xmath112 for @xmath113 and viceversa when @xmath114 .",
    "this implies that @xmath115 when @xmath116 ( @xmath114 ) , and @xmath117 when @xmath118 ( @xmath113 ) .    using a similar argument it is possible to analyze the sign of @xmath97 as given by eq.([elrtilde ] ) .",
    "the numerator is always positive , and then the sign of @xmath97 is governed by the denominator @xmath119 which reads    @xmath120    where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . as @xmath124 is an increasing function ,",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "the sign of the casimir interaction energy @xmath63 in eq.([concen ] ) is determined by the sign of the ratio @xmath129 .",
    "when this ratio is positive ( negative ) the energy is negative ( positive ) . from the above considerations it follows that for @xmath130 ( corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath131 ) , or for @xmath132 ( corresponding to @xmath133 and @xmath134 )",
    ", the casimir pressure is repulsive . for all other cases",
    "the casimir pressure is attractive .",
    "strictly speaking , the sign of the energy is not enough to determine the atractive / repulsive character of the pressure .",
    "however , we have checked using simple numerical evaluations that the integrand of eq.([concen ] ) is always a monotonous function of @xmath2 .    as we will see in section iv ,",
    "when the cylinders are eccentric ( @xmath135 ) , the same conditions imply a repulsive or attractive force , with the concentric configuration being an equilibrium situation . when @xmath136 or when @xmath137 this equilibrium is stable , and it is unstable in all other situations . just as in the case of the electromagnetic casimir - lifshitz interaction between media",
    "- separated planar slabs , it is only necessary that the above mentioned inequalities between the three different permittivities should hold in the relevant range of frequencies in eq.([concen ] ) .",
    "this frequency range is determined by the geometrical parameters , particularly by the minimum distance between the cylinders . in cases where the three permittivities satisfy the inequalities needed for repulsion in some frequency range , but violate them in some other frequency range , the global sign of the force results from a competition between the different contributions to the integrand in eq.([concen ] )",
