    "in recent years we have the seen signs of a new technological revolution in information processing , a revolution caused by a paradigm shift to information processing using the laws of quantum physics @xcite . since the pioneering work of feynman @xcite , deutsch @xcite , and shor @xcite a significant effort has occurred worldwide to develop the tools necessary to realise such a revolution .",
    "there are many possible routes and architectures @xcite available to develop these quantum information processing devices .",
    "it has long been thought that photons would be an extremely strong contender for realising some quantum information processing circuits @xcite .",
    "many of the photon s properties , for instance easy manipulation , have made them ideal for this .",
    "however , for scalable quantum information processing we require photons to interact with one another . to achieve such interactions it was known that massive reversible nonlinearities would be required @xcite .",
    "materials giving such large nonlinearities were thought to be ( and are still ) well beyond our ability to manufacture .",
    "knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm ) however found a way to create such nonlinearities using only linear optical elements , single photon sources and detectors @xcite .",
    "more precisely they showed how it is possible using such elements to perform conditionally the nonlinear transformation @xmath0 the optical circuit ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : klm ] ) creating this nonlinear transformation uses ancilla modes , one prepared with a single photon present and the other empty .",
    "the nonlinearity was induced by definite measurements of the presence of the single photon and the vacuum state in the appropriate ancilla modes .",
    "this insight has reopened the door to all - optical quantum information processing .",
    "other optical schemes @xcite have been proposed along the klm line to generate such sign shifts @xcite .",
    "these operations are generally conditional in nature . by this",
    "we mean the transformation only works when the appropriate measurement results are obtained at the ancilla detectors . while this would seem to limit the viability of the information processing , it is straightforward however by using a teleportation - based protocol to turn such nondeterministic operations into deterministic ones @xcite .",
    "schematic setup of the klm circuit for generating a nonlinear sign shift using 3 beam - splitters , a single photon source and single photon resolving detectors.,width=226 ]    there have been a number of key experiments demonstrating elements of linear optical information processing @xcite .",
    "these have generally focused on the technology necessary to perform single - qubit rotations and cnot gates .",
    "such gates are well known to be sufficient to perform universal computation ( they are the minimum set required ) . from these primitive elements interesting devices such as quantum repeaters @xcite and single - photon quantum non - demolition detectors",
    "@xcite can be created . in this paper",
    "we wish to shift the focus slightly . instead of using only these primitive gates we will investigate what operations can be constructed from linear elements , single photon sources , and detectors .",
    "this shift is analogous to the shift in classical computing from a risc ( reduced instruction set ) architecture to the cisc ( complex instruction set ) architecture . the risc - based architecture in quantum computing terms",
    "could be thought of as a device built only from the minimum set of gates while the cisc - based machine would be built from a much larger set , a natural set of gates allowed by the fundamental resources .",
    "our primary focus in this paper will be on the operations that can be constructed from the linear optics set .",
    "we show how to construct general operators that can be applied to the required input states .",
    "we further indicate what operations are _ easily _ constructed and what are potentially difficult , illustrating our constructive procedure with examples from one - mode and two - mode situations .",
    "our constructive procedure can easily be applied to multiple modes .",
    "the inputs to the computational modes do not need to be restricted to qubits only : the operations can be applied onto qudits and continuous variables just as easily .    this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we will derive some general expressions necessary for the construction of useful nonlinear operations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : single ] we will be concerned with single - mode operations , followed by two - mode operations in sec .  [",
    "sec : twomode ] . until then , we assume perfect beam splitters and detections which is an oversimplification , indeed .",
    "we will therefore focus on the effects of absorption and non - unit detection efficiencies in sec .",
    "[ sec : lossy ] before drawing some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . some useful formulae regarding permanents of unitary matrices can be found in the appendix .",
    "in order to introduce the notation we will be using throughout the paper we will briefly review the most basic features of quantum - state transformation by a lossless beam splitter .",
    "we refer the reader to the extensive literature for details @xcite .",
    "every ( lossless ) beam splitter can be thought of as a unitary operator on the level of photonic creation and annihilation operators of the incoming and outgoing fields , i.e. @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a unitary operator and @xmath3 the associated unitary matrix [ @xmath4 su(2 ) ] .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath3 consists of the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 and can be given in the form @xmath7 unitarity of @xmath3 requires @xmath8 which leads to the usual definition of the beam splitter ` angle ' @xmath9 by writing @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath2 can be given in several equivalent forms , two of which are the following : @xmath12 the effect of the beam splitter can not only be described by transforming the photonic operators , but equivalently by transforming the quantum state @xmath13 as @xmath14 noting that the input density operator @xmath15 can be written as a functional of photonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath16 $ ] , the quantum - state transformation can be represented as @xmath17 = \\hat{\\varrho}_{\\text{in}}\\left [ \\bm{\\lambda}^+ \\hat{\\bm{a } } , \\bm{\\lambda}^t \\hat{\\bm{a}}^\\dagger \\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] that is , the state transforms with the _ inverse _ operator @xcite .",
    "on the level of quantum states we thus have to perform the replacements @xmath18 we will use eq .",
    "( [ adagger ] ) extensively throughout the paper .",
    "suppose we were given an input state with @xmath19 modes with the associated creation and annihilation operators labelled by @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "additionally , we have a supply of @xmath22 auxiliary modes labelled by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "then , a general unitary transformation on all the modes maps @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "what we mean precisely by su(@xmath27 ) is a unitary operator on the level of photonic creation and annihilation operators in @xmath27 dimensions . in what follows",
    ", we will only make use of the unitarity of the corresponding matrices and will not further elaborate on the actual underlying group structure . in order to construct our quantum operations we will use the decomposition of an arbitrary element of the group su(@xmath19 ) into at most @xmath28 u(2 ) group elements , i.e. beam splitters @xcite .",
    "first , let us define our notation .",
    "by @xmath29 we mean the tensor product state @xmath30 .",
    "let the input state now be given in a functional form as @xmath31 and the auxiliary state in product form as @xmath32 .",
    "finally , the state we project on shall be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the output state after mixing at the beam splitter network and projecting onto @xmath34 looks then as    @xmath35 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{a}^\\dagger } f(\\hat{a},\\hat{a}^\\dagger)\\ ] ] to rewrite the output state as @xmath36 in a taylor series as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is constrained in such a way that @xmath39 . in that way",
    "we obtain the action of a su(@xmath27)-network in a quite general way . in general , this can be a laborious task . in order to see the structure behind it , let us focus first onto single - mode signal states .",
    "that is , the input state will be @xmath40 and the network will represent an element of the group su(@xmath41 ) .    in what follows we will restrict ourselves to the important special case when our resources consist of single photons and single - photon detectors . in this case",
    ", we can derive a number of interesting results .",
    "let us first start with a very simple ( and in fact well - known ) example , a single beam splitter . feeding a single photon in one input arm of the beam splitter and measuring a single photon leaving one output port of the beam splitter ,",
    "we have in fact created the conditional non - unitary operator [ using eq .",
    "( [ su(2 ) ] ) ] @xcite @xmath42\\ ] ] acting on some signal state @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : catalysis ] ) .",
    "this is a very special result and probably the simplest non - unitary operator one can actually generate .",
    "this conditional operator has already been realised in an experiment @xcite where it is called ` quantum - optical catalysis ' .",
    "schematic setup for generating the simplest non - unitary conditional operator with a single - photon input and a single - photon detection.,width=151 ]    in the following we will present some results on the general structure of conditional non - unitary operators .",
    "* proposition 1 * : let us suppose all @xmath19 auxiliary modes are prepared in single - photon states , and all @xmath19 detectors measure vacuum .",
    "this is equivalent to acting with an operator @xmath44 on the signal state ( left figure in fig .",
    "[ fig : th1 ] ) .",
    "+ _ proof _ : the auxiliary and detected states are latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\text{aux}}\\rangle=\\prod\\limits_{i=2}^{n+1 } \\hat{a}_i^\\dagger     ( un - normalised ) output state is therefore latexmath:[\\ ] ] this expression shows that it is only necessary to know the experimentally accessible transmission and reflection coefficients of the beam splitter that make up the matrix @xmath163 .",
    "now we make use of the fact that we actually wanted to generate a pauli-@xmath70 gate , meaning that we set in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wanted ] ) @xmath185 . with",
    "that we finally obtain for the ( still unnormalised ) output density matrix @xmath186    probability for perfect operation is @xmath187 .",
    "a note of caution is appropriate here .",
    "since we have fixed @xmath188 already , by reciprocity we have also fixed @xmath189 .",
    "for single - slab beam splitters that fixes @xmath190 , too , so that we are left with essentially a single number determining the fidelity of our desired gate operation . to be more precise , note that @xmath191 ( setting @xmath192 ) , and suppose that @xmath193 . then we immediately have that @xmath194 , and choosing @xmath195 we arrive at @xmath196 with this choice for @xmath197 we finally get @xmath198 which now only depends on two parameters , the absorption coefficient @xmath199 of the beam splitter and the detector efficiency @xmath168 . again , the first line is the desired result , the second is due to the non - perfect detector , and the last line is the contribution of the absorption .",
    "two special cases are notable here :    1 .   without absorption ( @xmath200 ) , the third line in eq .  ( [ eq : final ] ) vanishes and the numerical coefficient in the second line takes the value of @xmath201 .",
    "2 .   with perfect detectors ( @xmath202 ) , the second line vanishes and we are left with a contribution @xmath203 to the vacuum from the last line .    in principle , one could define a ( state - dependent ) gate fidelity or use some more elaborate definition such as an average fidelity integrated over all possible input states ( with respect to some haar measure ) but this is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "in this paper we have shown a constructive mechanism for generating arbitrary operators using only linear optics , single - photon sources , and single - photon detectors .",
    "we have focused our attention primarily on one - mode and two - mode situations , though the approach is easily extended to multimode situations .",
    "we have shown what operations are easy and what are potentially difficult .",
    "operations that cause a change in the fock layers ( for instance the hadamard operator ) are generally difficult but not impossible . while the generation of the operators is generally conditional on certain measurement results in the ancilla modes , the operators can be made deterministic using various teleportation protocols .",
    "finally we hope this paper shows the power in building the required operations from the fundamental resources rather than fundamental gates .",
    "the swap operation illustrates this point extremely well . from fundamental gates ,",
    "three cnots are required to build such an operation , however from fundamental resources , only two beam splitters and a phase shifter are necessary .",
    "this approach open a new way to think about operation generation .",
    "we would like to thank alexei gilchrist for useful discussions as this project developed .",
    "this work was funded in part by the feodor ",
    "lynen program of the alexander  von  humboldt foundation ( ss ) , the united kingdom engineering and physical sciences research council and the european union projects ramboq and quiprocone .",
    "here we recall some elementary properties of permanents , mainly taken from the only available monograph on this subject @xcite .",
    "the permanent of an @xmath204-matrix @xmath178 is a generalised matrix function , defined as @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the symmetric group of cyclic permutations .",
    "note that the determinant of a matrix is similarly defined with the only difference of a factor of @xmath207 appearing in all terms depending on the character ( even or odd ) of the permutation .",
    "the permanent of a matrix generically appears in counting problems , i.e. combinatorics and graph theory . in our case",
    "it is the probability amplitude of detecting the state @xmath208 after an input state of the exactly the same form has been transformed by an su(@xmath19)-network . in that sense",
    ", it naturally appears here as well since the combinatorial problem is here to ( re-)distribute @xmath19 single photons among @xmath19 single - photon detectors .",
    "the marcus ",
    "newman theorem states that the following inequality holds for all @xmath209-matrices @xmath178 and @xmath210-matrices @xmath211 : @xmath212 an immediate consequence is that ( setting @xmath213 ) , if @xmath214 is unitary , then @xmath215 ) tells us that the range of the permanent of a unitary matrix lies in the unit disk in the complex plane .",
    "in fact , the same conclusion can be drawn for the permanents of principal submatrices of unitary matrices by recalling that a unitary matrix consists of rows ( or columns ) of orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "for example , let us consider @xmath81 of @xmath216 su(3 ) .",
    "we have @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we know that @xmath219 similar relations hold for @xmath220 and @xmath221 and indeed for all permanents of submatrices of unitary matrices .",
