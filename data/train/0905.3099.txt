    "all initial collisions have proceeded , i.e. also the initial baryon currents have decoupled from each other , and it is the earliest time at which local thermodynamical equilibrium may be achieved . to map all point - like particles from urqmd onto the spatial grid of the hydrodynamic model each hadron",
    "is represented by a gaussian of finite width .",
    "this procedure is necessary , since the cell length of @xmath10 fm is much smaller than the actual size of a hadron .",

    "this width reflects the typical size of hadrons and avoids numerical instabilities ( numerical entropy production ) in the initial phase of the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "this instantaneous thermalization at @xmath6 goes along with an increase in entropy , as entropy is maximized in the equilibrium state .",
    "however , note that is has been checked that the results only weakly depend on the choice of the time @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "especially final particle multiplicities and their mean transverse mass only change by about @xmath12 , if the time @xmath6 is doubled .    for calculations at finite impact parameter , the spectators - particles that have not interacted until @xmath13 - are propagated separately from the hydrodynamic evolution .",

    "we neglect the @xmath43-meson contributions as we only discuss isospin - symmetric matter .",
    "the effective masses of the baryons and quarks are generated by the scalar mesons except for a small explicit mass term and the term containing the polyakov field @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath44 @xmath45 with the increase of temperature / density , the scalar fields decrease in value , causing the effective masses of the particles to decrease towards chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the polyakov loop effectively suppresses baryons at high temperatures / densities and quarks at low temperatures / densities due to their corresponding mass shifts shown above .",
    "+ due to meson vector interactions , the baryons obtain an effective chemical potential : @xmath46    all thermodynamic quantities are derived from the grand canonical potential @xmath47 by assuming an equilibrated state , where @xmath48 ( p is the pressure ) is in the absolute minimum of @xmath47 with respect to all fields . for the region of phase coexistence ( at the 1 .",

    "this of course implies , that the expanding system is in chemical equilibrium during the whole evolution .",

    "it is crucial for the numerical studies of heavy - ion simulations to have an equation of state at hand that shows reasonable behavior over a large range of densities and temperatures , which is the case here . in the following",

    "we will compare results obtained with the de to calculations using an eos consisting of a hadron resonance gas including all reliably known resonances with masses up to @xmath71 gev ( referred to as hadron gas hg ) .",
    "the hg is a very important ingredient of the model , because the active degrees of freedom on both sides of the transition hypersurface have to be equivalent to ensure the conservation of important quantities ( e.g. entropy ) . for the hg",
    "this is the case , as it has the same degrees of freedom as the urqmd model . in the de",
    "the hadrons acquire effective masses due to interaction and therefore this equivalence condition is only approximately fulfilled . to solve this problem we change the active equation of state after the last step of the hydrodynamical evolution ( from the deconfinement eos to the hg ) , thus obtaining the correct temperatures and chemical potentials for the particle distributions .",

    "<S> we investigate the influence of a deconfinement phase transition on the dynamics of hot and dense nuclear matter . to this aim a hybrid model with an intermediate hydrodynamic stage for the hot and dense phase of the system is employed for collisions of pb+pb / au+au at beam energies of @xmath0gev , while initial and final interactions are performed by a microscopic transport approach ( urqmd ) . in the hydrodynamic stage </S>",
    "<S> an equation of state that incorporates a critical end point ( cep ) in line with lattice data is used . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from coupling the polyakov loop ( as an order parameter for deconfinement ) to a chiral hadronic @xmath1 model . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> the eos describes chiral restoration as well as the deconfinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results from this new equation of state to results obtained , by applying a hadron resonance gas equation of state , focusing on bulk observables deemed to be sensitive to the phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy ion collisions at intermediate incident beam energies ( @xmath2gev ) offer the unique opportunity of being able to scan a wide range of temperatures @xmath3 and baryo - chemical potentials @xmath4 in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter @xcite ( for recent lattice qcd results see @xcite , for phenomenological studies see @xcite ) . in this energy region one </S>",
    "<S> hopes to find experimental evidence for a deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase ( where quarks are deconfined ) . </S>",
    "<S> especially the so - called critical end point ( cep ) , a point in the phase diagram that terminates the first order phase transition - line ( which is expected for high chemical potentials ) , is of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> + key bulk observables like the directed flow @xmath5 @xcite , but also particle multiplicities , ratios , and their fluctuations , have been predicted and sometimes already shown to be sensitive to the active degrees of freedom in the early stage of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the energy dependences of various observables show anomalies at low sps energies which might be related to the onset of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .    early - on </S>",
    "<S> , fluid dynamics has been proposed as an elegant way to include the eos of strongly interacting matter in the description of heavy ion collisions @xcite . especially since experiments at the rhic facility have claimed to have found a ( s)qgp that behaves like a nearly ideal fluid , the idea of modeling heavy ion collisions with ( ideal ) fluid dynamics has been revived @xcite .    in order to study the fluid dynamical evolution of a heavy ion collision , the different boundary conditions ( i.e. the initial space - time distributions of the corresponding energy and baryon density , as well as the freeze out prescription ) have to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> since experimental data provide mainly information from the final state of the reaction , integrated over the time evolution of the system , the initial state for hydrodynamical simulations is usually inferred from model assumptions or by an educated guess in comparison to data . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between ( observed ) final state and the inferred initial conditions is further blurred by the unknown equation of state , potential viscosity effects , and problems in the freeze - out treatment . </S>",
    "<S> another issue concerns the assumption of thermal equilibrium , which is probably not fulfilled for the early stages of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been attempts to solve these problems by describing such collisions with viscous or multi - fluid - hydrodynamic models @xcite , but the practical application of these models is difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> transport theory offers another , different , approach aiming at the consistent description of heavy - ion reactions , from the initial state to the final decoupling of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this microscopic description has been applied quite successfully to the partonic as well as to the hadronic stage of heavy ion collisions @xcite . however , to explain hadronization and the phase transition between the hadronic and the partonic phase on a microscopic level is one of the main issues to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore difficult to find an appropriate prescription of the phase transition in such a microscopic approach .    to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the whole dynamics of heavy ion reactions various so called micro+macro hybrid approaches </S>",
    "<S> have been developed during the last years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nexspherio approach uses initial conditions that are calculated in a non equilibrium model ( nexus ) followed by an ideal hydrodynamic evolution @xcite . for the freeze - out a continuous emission scenario or a standard cooper - frye calculation </S>",
    "<S> is employed . </S>",
    "<S> other groups , e.g. hirano et al @xcite , bass / nonaka @xcite , use smooth glauber or cgc initial conditions followed by a full three - dimensional hydrodynamic evolution and calculate the freeze - out with a subsequent hadronic cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of chemical and kinetic freeze - out and final state interactions like resonance decays and rescatterings are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper , we apply a transport calculation with an embedded three - dimensional ideal relativistic one - fluid calculation for the hot and dense stage of the reaction , thus reducing the parameters for both the initial conditions and the freeze - out prescription </S>",
    "<S> . this will allow us to compare calculations with different eos within the same framework and to extract the effect of changes in the eos - e.g. a phase transition from hadronic matter to the qgp - on observables . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this model has been used , applying a hadron resonance gas eos , to provide a baseline calculation , disentangling the effects of the different assumptions for the underlying dynamics in a transport vs. hydrodynamic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we will extend this purely hadronic calculation by introducing an eos that includes a deconfinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations will be performed in the broad energy range from @xmath0gev where experimental data from bnl - ags and cern - sps exists and which will be explored in more detailed energy scans by the fair project near gsi and the rhic low energy program . </S>"
