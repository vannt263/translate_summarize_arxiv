    "for some decades now , freely precessing neutron stars have been considered as possible sources of detectable gravitational radiation .",
    "early treatments include the ones by zimmermann et al .",
    "@xcite and by alpar and pines @xcite .",
    "more recently interest in the subject was revived by compelling observational evidence for free precession in the radio signature of psr  b1828 - 11 @xcite as well as psr  b1642 - 03 @xcite .",
    "evidence for free precession had also been put forward for psr  b0531 + 21 ( the crab pulsar ) @xcite and psr  b0833 - 45 ( the vela pulsar ) @xcite .",
    "these examples suggest the existence of more such objects , some of which might be viable sources for current or future ground - based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo .",
    "prompted by the evidence for free precession in psr  b1828 - 11 , cutler and jones @xcite revisited earlier work which seemed to suggest that when a neutron star is treated as an elastic body , gravitational wave back - reaction will quickly damp the precessing motion .",
    "careful consideration led them to conclude instead that in realistic precessing neutron stars , gravitational wave damping will play but a minor role in the star s evolution , although there will be other sources of damping .",
    "jones and andersson @xcite then constructed a detailed model of freely precessing neutron stars and compared it with the observational data .",
    "they concluded that the precessional interpretation of these observations required superfluid vortex pinning of the star s crust to its core to be inhibited , thereby challenging some of the then - prevalent ideas concerning a neutron star s liquid interior .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis by link and epstein @xcite supported the precessional hypothesis for psr  b1828 - 11 .    in @xcite ,",
    "jones and andersson evaluated the viability of precessing neutron stars as sources for gravitational wave detection in the near future . to estimate the strength of the signal",
    ", they used the waveforms computed by zimmermann et al .",
    "their conclusions appear to imply that gravitational waves from precessing neutron stars are unlikely to be detectable even with an advanced ligo detector .",
    "however , their paper was written before the more recent analysis of the expected capabilities of ligo ii by fritschel @xcite , which is the one we will use .    here",
    "we re - examine the gravitational waves generated by rapidly rotating , precessing neutron stars , evaluating whether the radiation from such sources might indeed be detectable , and what we may learn from their detection .",
    "the motion of a freely precessing neutron star has two characteristic frequencies associated with it : the precession frequency and the rotation frequency .",
    "the corresponding gravitational wave spectrum consists of a series of discrete spectral lines , with a principal line at or near a harmonic of the rotation frequency , surrounded by companion lines separated from the main line by multiples of the precessional frequency .    in @xcite",
    ", zimmermann evaluated to first order in small wobble angle the quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by freely precessing , non - axisymmetric neutron stars , approximated as rigid bodies . at first order the spectrum includes two spectral lines : one at approximately the pulsar frequency and another at its first harmonic .",
    "unfortunately , knowledge of the first - order spectrum yields little or no information about the physical characteristics of the neutron star emitting the radiation . from an observational point of view , this makes it imperative to study the spectrum in more detail .",
    "our goal here is threefold .",
    "first , we want to show that it is reasonable to take the precession angle as the primary expansion parameter among the various ` small ' parameters that characterize the problem .",
    "secondly , we want to determine the conditions under which the second - order contributions to the gravitational wave spectrum of a precessing neutron star are observable .",
    "finally , we would like to explore what observation of these second - order corrections can reveal about the physical properties of the source .    throughout this paper , we will use units where @xmath1 unless stated otherwise .",
    "wherever estimates are needed for the mass and radius of a neutron star , we will use @xmath2 and @xmath3 cm .",
    "the neutron stars of interest to us are fast - spinning ones ; in estimates involving rotation frequencies we use @xmath4 hz as a reference .",
    "we shall treat neutron stars as rigid bodies and limit ourselves to the quadrupole approximation to the gravitational radiation .",
    "when describing rigid body motion we will follow @xcite , i.e. , we use the physical conventions of @xcite and the mathematical notation of @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : review ] we review the closed expressions for the gravitational waveforms found in @xcite and in [ sec : zimmerman ] the first - order approximation of @xcite . in section [ sec:2ndorder ] , the closed expressions are used to construct a second - order expansion , and a new contribution to the gravitational radiation spectrum of precessing neutron stars is found .",
    "section [ sec : detectability ] first discusses the detectability of all three spectral lines .",
    "we then explain how physical information can be extracted from the second - order spectrum .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] provides a summary of the results and conclusions .",
    "the motion of an isolated , freely precessing rigid body is most conveniently described in terms of the euler angles @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 that orient the body with respect to an inertial coordinate system . following the conventions of @xcite ,",
    "denote the coordinates of the inertial coordinate system centered on the body by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , with the coordinate vector @xmath11 in the direction of the body s angular momentum .",
    "similarly , denote the coordinates of the body - fixed frame as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , with coordinate vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 parallel to the eigenvectors of the body s moment of inertia tensor , and with the corresponding principal moments of inertia satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "the euler angle @xmath5 is then the angle between @xmath11 and @xmath17 , @xmath6 is the angle between @xmath19 and the line of nodes that is the intersection of the @xmath20 plane and the @xmath21 plane , while @xmath7 is the angle in the @xmath22 plane between the line of nodes and @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "denote the time - dependent rotation matrix that transforms from the body - frame to the inertial frame by @xmath23 , where latin indices refer to the inertial frame and greek indices refer to the body - fixed frame .",
    "the quadrupole gravitational radiation from the precessing body is proportional to the second time derivative of the moment of inertia tensor in the inertial frame , which depends on the principal moments of inertia and the time - dependent rotation matrix .",

    "( [ eq : htt ] ) can be written in terms of the rotation matrix @xmath23 , the components @xmath27 of the angular velocity in the body - fixed frame , and the eigenvalues of the rigid body s moment of inertia tensor @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31 where summation over @xmath32 and @xmath33 is understood .",

    "these closed expressions fully describe the gravitational wave signal from a freely precessing , rigid body .",
    "however , after all is said and done , the problem involves just two periodicities determined by @xmath70 and @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , the radiation should be resolvable into a discrete spectrum .",
    "knowledge of the amplitude and frequencies of the spectral lines greatly simplifies the analysis of gravitational wave data .",
    "the discrete nature of the spectrum becomes apparent when @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as given in equations ( [ eq : closed ] ) , are expanded in terms of ` small ' parameters : the ` wobble angle parameter ' @xmath66 , the rigid body s oblateness , and its deviation from axisymmetry .",
    "finding the second - order contributions to the spectrum in these parameters , evaluating the observability of the associated spectral lines , and exploring what can be learned from such observations will be our main considerations .",
    "in his first - order expansion of @xmath79 and @xmath78 , zimmermann identified two expansion parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath80 :    @xmath81    to find the ` first - order ' contributions to the radiation spectrum , zimmermann    * expanded the rotation matrix @xmath82 to first order in @xmath59 and @xmath80 ; * substituted the expanded rotation matrix into the relation between the inertia tensor in the inertial frame and that in the body frame ; * substituted the inertia tensor in the inertial frame into the standard quadrupole formulae for the strains ( [ eq : htt ] ) ; * truncated the resulting @xmath77 and @xmath78 to first order in small @xmath66 , small oblateness @xmath83 , and small non - axisymmetry @xmath84 .",

    "non - axisymmetry is often discussed in terms of an ` equatorial eccentricity ' : if the body is approximated as an ellipsoid rotating about an axis associated with a principal moment of inertia , then it will look identical after half a rotation period , hence the frequency @xmath88 . line ii encodes the precessing motion ; recall that @xmath66 is approximately the wobble angle .",
    "the coupling of precession and rotation causes the frequency of this line to be shifted upwards by @xmath89 ; note that both motions are in the same sense . as we shall see later on , this coupling also has an effect near line i , although it only becomes visible at higher orders in the precession angle .",
    "zimmermann s calculation of the first order contribution to the gravitational radiation from rigid body free precession @xcite involved the expansion parameters @xmath59 and @xmath80 defined by the somewhat awkward expressions ( [ m ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) , and at the end further truncations were made in terms of different small quantities . here",
    "we will expand in terms of small parameters that have a more direct physical meaning .",
    "the wobble angle is only one of several small parameters in the problem . to set up a second - order expansion",
    ", we will first specify a suitable set of expansion parameters and then estimate the size of these parameters for realistic neutron stars .",
    "these estimates will tell us to what order we need to expand in parameters other than the wobble angle parameter @xmath66 to arrive at a sufficiently good approximation for the waveforms .",
    "they will also yield information about the amplitudes of the different spectral lines at first and second order .    unlike zimmermann , who used the general expressions for the quadrupole radiation ( [ eq : htt ] )",
    ", our starting point will be the closed forms ( [ eq : closed ] ) for @xmath79 and @xmath90 .",
    "there is no significant difference between the two approaches , but expansions of the closed formulae will lead to somewhat more elegant expressions for the spectral line amplitudes .",
    "overall , our aim is to make the derivation and physical meaning of both the first - order and second - order results as transparent as possible .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 defined by eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) encodes two pieces of information at once : the deviation from axisymmetry and the precession angle . to understand the role played by each , factor @xmath59 as @xmath91 where the new small parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined by    @xmath94    the parameter @xmath92 describes the precession angle while @xmath93 describes the non - axisymmetry ( @xmath95 ) relative to the axisymmetric non - sphericity ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "note that in all cases that are of astrophysical interest , @xmath97 ; this and the factor of @xmath98 in @xmath93 have been included for computational convenience .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 ( eq .  [ delta ] ) is related to the new parameter @xmath93 ; it will be discussed in subsection c below .",
    "we would like to stress that specifying these different expansion parameters from the outset does not imply a departure from the approach of @xcite .",
    "close inspection of that analysis shows that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are in fact used implicitly to truncate to first order in @xmath66 at the end of the computation . introducing them from the beginning",
    "merely facilitates the calculation .    in order to develop appropriate parameters for the second order expansion ,",
    "we need to find out what astrophysics is involved in the new parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and any other relevant ` small ' quantities .",
    "note that in realistic cases , @xmath92 and @xmath93 will not be independent , since the precession is determined for the most part by the loss of axisymmetry .",
    "ideally , it would be a simple exercise in classical mechanics to find the relationship : one could start from a non - precessing , axisymmetric body and then study what kind of precessing motions are induced by various continuous deformations .",
    "however , we may assume that during a starquake other factors will be at play , such as torques induced by partial crustal pinning of vortices in the interior . to estimate their effect",
    "we would have to take recourse to the existing models of pinning , which seem to be contradicted by the observations of apparently free precession in pulsars @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will mostly disregard any a priori relation between @xmath92 and @xmath93 and keep the discussion as general as possible .",
    "let us first look into some estimates for oblateness , non - axisymmetry , and the precession angle .",
    "oblateness was described by baym and pines @xcite as @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the rigidity parameter , which depends on the equation of state ; in @xcite it was derived to be @xmath101 for very young neutron stars , the zero strain oblateness @xmath102 will depend on the shape of the star when the crust first solidified ; subsequent starquakes as well as less violent plastic deformations will change it",
    ". we will take it to be of the order of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy : @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "we have set @xmath105 and @xmath3 cm , which are the values for mass and radius we will use throughout this paper .",
    "( [ oblateness ] ) , ( [ rigidity ] ) , and ( [ reference ] ) lead to an oblateness of @xmath106 the implied range agrees with estimates by alpar and pines @xcite ; see also the discussion in cutler and jones @xcite .",
    "to arrive at an estimate of @xmath93 , we need information as to how a neutron star loses its axisymmetry ; here we will follow the analysis by link , franco , and epstein @xcite . according to their model",
    ", a starquake is expected to induce fault lines at angles of 30 to 45 degrees relative to the equator .",
    "crust material shifts along the faults and accumulates in mountains with a typical height of @xmath107 cm .",
    "we may assume @xmath108 with @xmath109 the mass contained in a mountain and @xmath110 the radius of the neutron star .",
    "one has @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the change in equatorial radius due to the decrease in oblateness , @xmath113 is the fault length , and @xmath114 is the mass of the crust .",
    "the factor in front of @xmath114 in ( [ mountain ] ) is the fraction of the star s area that moves with the fault .",
    "assuming an outer crust density , which in turn will yield an underestimate of the amplitude of line i. ] of @xmath115 @xmath116 and a crust thickness in the order of @xmath117 , we can use the expression for @xmath118 in @xcite to arrive at @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the average time between large starquakes and @xmath121 is the spin - down age .",
    "we now have sufficient information to estimate @xmath93 . using ( [ kappa ] ) , ( [ resob ] ) , and ( [ nonax ] ) , we find @xmath122    the most important ` small ' parameter in our analysis will be the wobble angle @xmath92 . for sufficiently small rotation frequencies ,",
    "the wobble angle is essentially unconstrained .",
    "for rapidly rotating neutron stars ( which are the ones of interest for gravitational wave detection ) , jones and andersson @xcite propose the following expression for the maximum wobble angle that can be supported by the crust : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the strain at which the crust fractures .",
    "it is easy to understand this expression qualitatively ; if @xmath125 is large , so will be the oblateness and hence the equatorial bulge .",
    "the star will then have to displace more matter while precessing , leading to higher crustal strains . in @xcite",
    ", the breaking strains of terrestrial materials were extrapolated to yield estimates in the range @xmath126 , although the reliability of such extrapolations is unclear .",
    "note that if the breaking strain is near the upper limit of this range , @xmath127 , the expression ( [ maxwobble ] ) implies an unconstrained precession angle even at a rotation frequency of 100 hz .      from the estimates ( [ resob ] ) , ( [ nonax ] ) , ( [ estkappa ] ) and ( [ maxwobble ] ) of the previous subsection",
    ", we infer that in the frequency band of interest , @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "we will choose @xmath92 as our primary expansion parameter .",
    "the approximation ( [ waveform ] ) for the waveforms is of first order in @xmath92 ; here we will go to order @xmath130 .",
    "however , we will only retain first - order terms in @xmath93 .",
    "the latter will be treated on the same footing as @xmath130 , so that terms in , e.g. , @xmath131 will be discarded .",
    "considering that quantities of the form @xmath132 are our smallest parameters , we will also take those to be of order @xmath130 .",
    "accordingly , the quantities @xmath37 defined in ( [ deltagamma ] ) will be approximated as @xmath133 whenever multiplied with @xmath92 or @xmath93 , and similarly for @xmath134 , @xmath135 with cyclic permutation of the indices .    in the expansions of the waveforms , linear combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined in ( [ deltagamma ] )",

    "also , the non - axisymmetry parameter @xmath80 defined in ( [ delta ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath93 as @xmath139 again up to terms in @xmath138 .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the spectrum at second order in the wobble angle .",
    "the expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath27 given in @xcite can be expanded to second order in @xmath92 and to first order in @xmath93 . by substituting the results into ( [ eq : closed ] ) and truncating appropriately we find the desired second - order expansion of the waveforms .    in the expansions ,",
    "the time dependence of the waveforms is given entirely in terms of linear combinations of products of trigonometric functions , with frequencies that are integer linear combinations of the basic frequencies @xmath140 and @xmath89 .",

    "figure 1 gives a schematic representation of the spectrum at second order in the precession angle .",
    "in subsection [ subsec : astrophysics ] , astrophysical estimates were obtained for the small parameters governing the problem : the wobble angle @xmath92 , the deviation from axisymmetry @xmath93 , and the oblateness . with the expressions for the amplitudes of the spectral lines found in the previous subsection",

    "finally , for line iii : @xmath164    in jones and andersson @xcite , detectability of spectral lines from precessing neutron stars was discussed using estimates of the sensitivity of interferometric detectors that differ from the ones we will use . their paper was written before the more recent analysis of the expected capabilities of ligo ii by fritschel @xcite . here we will assume a ligo ii detector , optimized for isolated neutron star observations by adding a signal recycling mirror at the output , the position of which can be changed macroscopically . for frequencies between 500 and 1000 hz , this leads to a strain sensitivity of @xmath165 @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "a one - year integration time would then allow for the detection of signals with amplitudes as low as @xmath167    from ( [ nonaxline ] ) , we see that line i should be detectable for a spin - down age much less than @xmath168 years .",

    "( [ precline2 ] ) shows that one needs @xmath172 for the second - order line to be detectable .",

    "let us assume that line iii has enough power to be detectable .",
    "we can then distinguish between two cases .",

    "as we have just seen , knowledge of the amplitudes and frequencies of the three spectral lines at second order suffices to infer values for @xmath43 , @xmath93 , @xmath182/i_3 $ ] , and of course @xmath183 . from the expression above , it is then clear that by inserting an educated guess for the principal moment of inertia @xmath30 ( as we have been doing to assess the detectability of the lines ) , we can obtain a rough estimate of the distance to the source .",
    "we derived the quadrupole gravitational wave spectrum of a rigidly rotating and freely precessing neutron star up to second order in the precession angle .    before doing so",
    ", we reviewed zimmermann s first - order expansion of the waveforms @xcite .",
    "we then introduced new ` small ' parameters which are more directly related to the physical quantities of interest , with a view on facilitating the second order expansion and its interpretation , and also clarifying the earlier work .",
    "these parameters correspond to the oblateness , the deviation from axisymmetry , and the precession angle of the neutron star .",
    "next , we made careful astrophysical estimates of physical quantities characterizing neutron stars .",
    "this led to estimates of the ` small ' parameters , which justified the use of the wobble angle as the primary expansion parameter for a higher - order expansion of the waveforms , putting the other small parameters on the same footing as the square of the wobble angle .",
    "in addition , the estimates explained why the truncations implicitly made by zimmermann were physically reasonable .",
    "we then used the new small parameters to set up an expansion of the waveforms to second order in precession angle .",
    "the approach taken differed somewhat from that of zimmermann s in that we used as a starting point the closed expressions for the specific case of quadrupole radiation from rigidly rotating and precessing bodies instead of the general formulae , truncating directly in terms of parameters with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "our method does not imply a significant departure from zimmermann s approach , but it does make the calculations and the end result more transparent .    at first order ,",
    "the two spectral lines predicted by zimmermann were retrieved : line i , which is associated with non - axisymmetry , and line ii which results from the precessing motion . at second order ,",
    "a single additional line was found ( line iii ) .",
    "it appears as a ` sidelobe ' to line i and is separated from it by twice the precession frequency .",
    "on the basis of our estimates for the small parameters , we evaluated the detectability of the three spectral lines with a ligo ii detector optimized for isolated neutron star observations @xcite , assuming a one - year integration time . for a rotation frequency of 500 hz and a distance of 10 kpc , together with some conservative assumptions concerning neutron star structure , we found that :    * line i should be detectable if the neutron star s spin - down age is much less than @xmath168 years ; * observability of line ii depends on the crustal breaking strain , which is subject to much uncertainty .",
    "however , the line can be observable even if the breaking strain is near the lower limit of the range proposed by ruderman @xcite ; * if the breaking strain is near the upper end of this range , line iii can also be detectable .",
    "hence , it may well be possible to observe the entire second - order spectrum of neutron stars as far away as the galactic center .    finally , we investigated what gravitational wave observations might tell us about the neutron star emitting the radiation .",
    "the two first - order spectral lines found by zimmermann would not allow one to infer much about the intrinsic physical properties of the source beyond the rotation and precession frequencies .",
    "to separate the precession angle , the deviation from axisymmetry and the oblateness from given data , at least one additional line is needed .",
    "our results provide the missing information : if the second order line can be seen , then it does become possible to infer these quantities .",
    "the direct measurement of these characteristics would permit an evaluation of the models for neutron star structure and evolution that led to our estimates of the small parameters @xcite , in a way that would be impossible by conventional astronomical means .",
    "the detailed implications for neutron star modeling will be investigated elsewhere .    given our assessment of the observability of the spectral lines we found , it may be of interest to extend our results by constructing still higher - order expansions . the scheme presented here",
    "can easily be used to compute any number of discrete contributions to the quadrupole gravitational wave spectrum of freely precessing neutron stars , modeled as rigid bodies .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank vijay chickarmane , ian jones , steinn sigurdsson , and patrick sutton for useful discussions .",
