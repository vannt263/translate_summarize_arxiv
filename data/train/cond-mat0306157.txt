    "in the monochalcogenides of anomalous rare earths ( re ) like sm or tm the equilibrium between two valence states ( sm@xmath5/sm@xmath6 or tm@xmath5/tm@xmath6 ) governs the release of a 5@xmath7 electron @xcite .",
    "let us start with our new guided tour of the canonical example of sms .",
    "the full line @xmath8 of the ( @xmath9 ) phase diagram ( see fig.[figure1 ] ) represents the first order isostructural transition between the black ( b ) insulating ( i ) sm@xmath5 phase and the so called gold ( g ) phase where the sm ions jumps to an intermediate valence state @xmath10 . in this gold phase ,",
    "smoothly increasing the pressure must lead to recover a trivalent sm@xmath6 ; it is a kramers ion , long range magnetic order must appear above this threshold @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore a sound experimental fact is that up to @xmath12  kbar in the low pressure gold phase a many body insulating phase is smoothly formed on cooling .",
    "whatever the sample quality and the pressure conditions , @xmath13 is a fixed pressure above which the sample is clearly metallic i.e.  its resistivity @xmath14 decreases on cooling after reaching a maximum @xmath15 at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the recent combination of macroscopic measurements by transport and ac specific heat and of the microscopic probe of the hyperfine field on the sm nuclei by nuclear forward scattering ( nfs ) using esrf facility demonstrates that long range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order appears at @xmath17 . as the pressure variation of @xmath16 now identified as the nel temperature @xmath18 is huge",
    ", @xmath4 is presumably a first order point associated with a lattice parameter discontinuity i.e.  a tiny valence jump at @xmath19 towards the trivalent state .",
    "by contrast to the sm case where the valence fluctuations occur between the sm@xmath5 state with a zero angular momentum ( @xmath20 ) and sm@xmath6 with a @xmath21 angular momentum , for the tm ions the mixing is between two finite angular momentum states , respectively @xmath22 ( tm@xmath5 ) and @xmath23 ( tm@xmath6 ) .",
    "whatever the pressure i.e.  the valence and even the electronic conduction , the ground state is magnetic .",
    "however , the similarity with sms is a link between magnetic properties and 4@xmath2 localisation . for tmte as shown on fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the @xmath24 sequence of ground states is af / i up to @xmath25 , ferromagnetic ( f ) and metallic ( m ) up to @xmath26 and finally the entrance to a af metallic state @xcite ; the rapid collapse of @xmath27 just below @xmath26 and the fast increase of @xmath18 just above @xmath26 suggests a first order transition . for tmse , already in the gold phase at @xmath28",
    ", the switch at @xmath26 occurs between an af insulating phase @xmath29 and another af metallic state above @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "tms itself appears already at @xmath28 as a quiet quasitrivalent metallic state , in principle the ideal kondo lattice @xcite .",
    "as pointed out already , the cerium heavy fermion problem can be summarized by two major ( @xmath30 ) phase diagrams . the wellknown @xmath31 first order transition of the cerium metal and the up to date magnetic phase diagram @xmath18 or @xmath27 versus pressure where the ordering temperature may collapse at @xmath4 @xcite . for the cerium metal ,",
    "the treatment of the magnetism can be crude as all characteristic temperatures @xmath31 are high by comparison to any hypothetical @xmath18 or any fine structure as the crystal field splitting @xmath32 of the trivalent @xmath33 phase . at @xmath28 , @xmath34 is already positive , finite and near 100  k and the critical end points @xmath35  k , @xmath36  kbar are large . for typical",
    "cerium heavy fermion compounds @xmath4 is lower or comparable to @xmath37 and of course @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be negative .",
    "however , the 4@xmath2 electron will feel the distance from @xmath37 and cause the crossing through a characteristic pressure @xmath26 where the local susceptibility loses the anisotropy given by its reaction to the crystal field ( that corresponds to the well known condition @xmath40 ( kondo energy ) greater than @xmath32 ) . above @xmath26 , the 4@xmath2 electron stays rigidly linked to the full degenerancy of the @xmath21 angular momentum . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the sensitivity of the 4@xmath2 electron to the crystal field has vanished ; @xmath26 is characteristic of a valence crossover .",
    "the relative location of @xmath4 and the hidden parameter @xmath26 is one of the key issue .",
    "the idea that singular properties is underpinned by a quantum critical point i.e.   pressure is one of the trends of strongly correlated electronic systems ( see references @xcite for the hidden order of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 or @xcite for the metamagnetic quantum criticality in sr@xmath41ru@xmath0o@xmath42 and @xcite for the conversion of a kondo gas to heavy electron kondo liquid ) .",
    "recently special focus has been given on systems just on the paramagnetic verge of @xmath4 i.e.  at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the non fermi liquid ( nfl ) label refers to the difficulty to reach the standard fermi liquid regime where usual laws are found , even for non - interacting fermi gas ( specific heat @xmath44 linear in temperature @xmath45 , susceptibility in @xmath46 , scattering rate proportional to @xmath46 ) ; the nfl label guarantee `` vintage '' describes a very large temperature crossover before reaching the fermi liquid graal or a new state of matter .    to clarify the complexity of this strongly correlated electronic system , an old fashioned approach via thermodynamic languages",
    "will be carried out @xcite . in the same spirit as the clapeyron and ehrenfest relations on the @xmath24 , @xmath45 feedback for first or second order transitions , the grneisen parameter @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively the volume thermal expansion",
    ", the molar volume and the isothermal compressibility ) is a unique experimental gauge of interfering hierarchies .",
    "it will be reduced to a constant @xmath51 only if the free energy @xmath52 can be expressed by a unique parameter @xmath53 i.e.   @xmath54 figure [ figure3 ] represents the temperature variation of the grneisen parameter of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 at @xmath28 i.e.  roughly 3 kbar above the critical pressure @xmath55  kbar .",
    "the two singular points are : ( i ) the huge extrapolated value of @xmath56 and ( ii ) the slow entrance in a simple regime ( @xmath57  k ) where @xmath48 and @xmath58 reach their proportionality @xcite . the pressure dependence of @xmath59 is shown in the insert of fig.[figure3 ] . at low pressure close to @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath51 is weakly pressure dependent changing from 190 to 220 for a negative shift of @xmath60  kbar @xcite while @xmath59 drops to 80 at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "other values of @xmath61 can be listed crudely for other heavy fermion system . in a double logarithmic representation of the volume dependence of the @xmath62 coefficient of the well known @xmath63 fermi liquid resistivity assuming the usual kadowaki - woods rule @xmath64 , @xmath51 is directly linked to the slope of the curve @xcite .",
    "the compound ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 is a quasi - ideal kondo lattice with a nice ordered tetragonal lattice , a robust ising character of the local susceptibility , the realization of a clean limit condition i.e.  a mean free path higher than 1000   far larger than an hypothetical superconducting coherence length with temperature @xmath65  mk and good enough to obtain the complete determination of the fermi surface ( fs ) at least above @xmath4 ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the application of a magnetic field @xmath66 along the easy @xmath67 axis leads to a switch through a drastic continuous crossover at @xmath68 from a low field paramagnetic phase ( pa ) dominated by af correlations at a finite wavevector @xmath69 to a highly polarized state ( pp ) dominated by the low wavevector @xmath70 excitation .",
    "the microscopic vision of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 was nicely given by inelastic neutron scattering experiments , ( i ) with at @xmath71 , the balance between the local response and the intersite coupling , ( ii ) with , under magnetic field , the continuous spreading of the af response with the same characteristic glumly energy @xmath72  mev up to @xmath73 @xcite and the observation just in the vicinity of @xmath73 of an inelastic ferromagnetic signal at far lower energy transfer @xmath74  mev than @xmath75 ( see fig.[figure4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "a skilful mechanism characteristic of the kondo lattice ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 controles the `` ping - pong '' between the magnetic interactions .",
    "quite remarkably , the field and temperature response is well reproduced by a simple form of the thermodynamic as the entropy .",
    "@xmath76 with equal grneisen parameters @xmath77 . with this hypothesis",
    "one can predict the field variation of @xmath78 knowing the field variation of the linear thermal expansion @xmath79 . a satisfactory agreement is found between this scaling derivation of @xmath80 and the bare determination either by specific heat or by magnetization@xcite .",
    "physically , the adaptive formation of the many body kondo lattice bands is characterized by a pseudogap .",
    "the ising spin character of the bare local magnetic ion plays a capital role in the sharpness of this electronic substructure and correlatively for the pseudo - metamagnetism @xcite .",
    "the pseudogap ingredient is a key input in any theory which needs to respect the scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "reminiscent of the @xmath81 collapse of the cerium metal , the associated spectacular lattice softening ( @xmath82% ) is again in agreement with the push pull between magnetic , electronic and lattice instabilities @xcite and the underpinned vicinity of a quantum critical end point .",
    "after a lecture describing the `` beauty '' ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 to quantum criticality , the first attack is to produce the proofs that ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 is close to a magnetic instability .",
    "looking back to the primitive results one decade ago on the ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 series either sweeping electronic density ( doping or pressure ) or magnetic field , a nfl increase of @xmath83 on cooling in a given temperature window justifies the proximity to @xmath4 @xcite . furthermore , this variation is not drastically different from that popularized in the canonical example of cecu@xmath84au@xmath85 @xcite after a rescaling of the temperature by some phenomenological parameter describing the proximity to @xmath4 and also differences in physical ingredients . as on approaching @xmath4 ,",
    "no drastic pressure dependence of @xmath51 occurs .",
    "collapsing to @xmath4 on the paramagnetic side does not lead to an `` earthquake '' even if of course @xmath53 will collapse when @xmath86 .",
    "the deviation from any singular scaling law of the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath87 becomes also quite difficult to point out .",
    "the yet unanswered dilemma is if a new state of matter occurs right at @xmath4 .    the obsessive focus just at @xmath4 or on the paramagnetic ( pa ) side ( @xmath88 ) leads to neglect the disappearance of long range magnetism .",
    "as many tunings were realized by doping i.e.  at the cost of an increase of disorder , @xmath4 appears as a second order quantum phase transition .",
    "comparison with the previous chalcogenide cases , recent nmr experiments on cein@xmath41 close to @xmath89 with evidence of af and pa magnetic phase separation @xcite as well as drastic fermi surface changes at @xmath4 in cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite point out that at the limit of a pure lattice at @xmath4 the transition may be first order . today one key question is to determine precisely the fermi surface on both sides of @xmath4 knowing the two limit conditions of a localized 4@xmath2 picture at low pressure ( @xmath90 ) and an itinerant 4@xmath2 picture at high pressure ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "progress will imply a deep interdisciplinary collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians eager to track carefully the @xmath24 and @xmath66 variations including the modification of the brillouin zone and the differentiation between spin up and spin down effective mass carriers .    for unconventional superconductivity ,",
    "the nature of the phase transition at @xmath4 is not critical as proved by the occurrence of superconductivity in cein@xmath41 and cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "there are examples like cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 , cein@xmath41 and cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 where the superconducting pocket is stocked to @xmath92 ; there are cases like cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite and ceni@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite where two superconducting domains are centered on distinct pressures @xmath4 and @xmath26",
    ". we will test soon if superconductivity appears on the verge of @xmath93  kbar in ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 ; near @xmath94  kbar , the ising character of the spin allows only longitudinal magnetic fluctuations which does not favor the observation of @xmath7 wave pairing @xcite while near @xmath26 this superconductivity can be promoted by the emergence of transverse magnetic modes as well as valence fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is time to concentrate on the complete bundle of curves on each side of @xmath4 in ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 as well as in the other cerium tetragonal lattices and yb homologues following our dresden colleagues @xcite .",
