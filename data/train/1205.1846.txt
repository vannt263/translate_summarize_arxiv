    "the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been studied for many years . the unobservable gap between the extreme uv and soft x - rays , imposed by galactic photoelectric absorption sets a major barrier to reconstructing the overall sed .",
    "this is particularly problematic because it is in this energy range that the peak of the sed often occurs . due to this difficulty , most previous work focused on spectral properties of either the optical / uv side ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1989 ; francis et al . 1991 ; zheng et al . 1997 ; vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) , or the x - ray side ( e.g. wilkes & elvis 1987 ; green et al . 1995 ; george et al .",
    "however , the multi - wavelength combination is required to see the overall sed behaviour ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ; richards et al . 2006 ;",
    "shang et al .",
    "2005 ; lusso et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter : lusso10 ) . in order to recover the spectral shape in the uv / soft x - ray gap ,",
    "some studies simply connected the optical / uv and x - ray spectra to estimate the sed ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; richards et al . 2006 ; shang et al .",
    "2005 ; lusso10 ) .",
    "as the origin of the optical and hard x - ray emission became clearer , more broadband sed models with multiple physical components were used to fit the multi - waveband spectra .",
    "these were used to extrapolate across the uv gap based on the model assumptions , but with better justification than before ( e.g. middleton , done & gierliski 2007 ; vasudevan & fabian 2007 , hereafter : vf07 ; vasudevan & fabian 2009 , hereafter : vf09 ; jin et al .",
    "2009 ; grupe et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter : grupe10 ) .",
    "for example , vf07 used a power law plus accretion disc model to construct the broadband sed for their sample .",
    "this technique was repeated in vf09 based on 29 agns from the reverberation mapping sample ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , and using simultaneous optical / uv and x - ray data from xmm - newton .",
    "grupe10 used an absorbed power law for the x - ray spectrum , and an exponentially cut - off power law ( or a broken power law ) for the optical / uv spectrum , to construct the broadband sed for their sample , for which simultaneous optical , uv , x - ray data are available from swift .",
    "further discussion of some previous sed studies is given in jin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( hereafter : paper - i ) .    within these works ,",
    "some specific agn parameters were studied , including black hole mass ( m@xmath6 ) , eddington ratio ( @xmath16 ) , bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath15 ) , 2 - 10 kev luminosity ( l@xmath17 ) , 2 - 10 kev photon index ( @xmath0 ) , h@xmath18 fwhm . also , some parameters directly related to the broadband sed shape were proposed , such as the optical to x - ray spectral index ( @xmath7 , assuming @xmath19 to ensure a non - negative @xmath7 . ] , tananbaum et al .",
    "1979 ) , 2 - 10 kev bolometric correction ( @xmath14 , defined as l@xmath15/l@xmath17 , e.g. vf07 ) , 5100 luminosity scaling factor ( @xmath12 , defined as l@xmath15/l@xmath20 , where l@xmath20 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 , kaspi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "since the number of agn with both high quality optical / uv and x - ray spectra is relatively small , much effort is devoted to search for correlations among the key sed parameters , especially those parameters capable of representing the broadband sed shape .",
    "then , for those many agns lacking sufficient spectral information , these correlations can be used to predict the seds that can not be defined from direct observation .",
    "indeed , many such parameter correlations have been proposed .",
    "for example , vf07 reported a strong correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( vf07 ; vf09 ; lusso10 ) .",
    "correlations were also found between h@xmath18 fwhm and @xmath0 ( e.g. leighly 1999 ; reeves & turner 2000 ; shemmer et al . 2006 , hereafter : s06 ; shemmer et al . 2008 , hereafter : s08 ; zhou & zhang 2010 , hereafter : zhou10a ) , between @xmath13 and @xmath0 ( e.g. lu & yu 1999 ; porquet et al . 2004 ; wang , watarai & mineshige 2004 ; bian 2005 ; s06,08 ) , and between h@xmath18 fwhm and @xmath13 ( e.g. grupe10 ; paper - i ) .",
    "the correlation between l@xmath21 and l@xmath22 is another important result , which led to further correlation studies related to @xmath7 , l@xmath21 , l@xmath22 and redshift ( e.g. green et al . 2009 , see references given in table  [ slope : compare : table ] ) . in table",
    "[ former : study : summary : table ] , we list some of the principal parameters , and list the relevant papers discussing the correlations . later in the papers we will discuss some additional correlations e.g. m@xmath6 vs. @xmath0 and m@xmath6 vs. @xmath14 , in the context that changes in these parameters are caused by changes in the fundamental physical processes .",
    "however , due to the difficulty in obtaining and analyzing both optical / uv and x - ray spectra for a large sample , these parameter correlations are reported separately and based on different samples , rather than being studied systematically for a single well - defined sample .",
    "furthermore , most of the previous samples were not selected based on their spectral properties , so effects such as reddening will introduce biases into the cross - correlations . the lack of a self - consistent physically motivated broadband model , has also been a constraint to performing a more detailed sed study .    in paper - i , we defined a sample of 51 type 1 agns with both optical / uv and x - ray spectra which are of high quality , and without evidence of complex spectral absorption features e.g. a warm absorber .",
    "based on this bright and unobscured type 1 agn sample , we applied our latest optical and broadband sed model to perform the spectral fitting , and so matched the optical spectrum and produced a broadband sed for each agn in the sample .",
    "this is so far the most detailed spectral analysis for a medium sized sample of agns , with such well defined high quality spectra . in our preceding paper ( jin , ward & done 2012 , hereafter : paper - ii )",
    ", we studied the balmer emission line properties and the relation between the optical and x - ray emission , based on the same sample and the spectral fitting results given in paper - i .",
    "this paper is based on the sample of paper - i , but focuses on the shape of the broadband sed , and how this relates to a range of parameters from the model .",
    "we will approach this problem by first investigating the numerous correlations previously reported .",
    "then a set of mean seds based on key parameters are constructed and studied in detail .",

    "<S> this shows that the three physical parameters , i.e. black hole mass , mass accretion rate and eddington ratio , drive the majority of the correlations . </S>",

    "<S> , we split the agn into three sub - samples , binned based on increasing value of that parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we co - add the model seds for each object in the sub - sample to see how the sed changes with that parameter . </S>",
    "<S> most parameters , except l@xmath15 , show similar systematic changes in the sed such that the temperature at which the disc peaks is correlated with the ratio of power in the disc versus the comptonised components and the hard x - ray spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> this underlying change in sed shape shows that agn do exhibit intrinsically different spectral states . </S>",
    "<S> this is superficially similar to the sed differences in bhb ( black hole binary ) seen as @xmath13 increases , but the analogy does not hold in detail . only objects with the highest @xmath13 appear to correspond to a bhb spectral state ( the disc dominated high / soft state ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agn with typical mass accretion rates have spectra which do not match well with any state observed in bhb . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this could be due to the presence of a powerful uv line driven disc wind , which complicates simple mass scaling between stellar and supermassive black holes .    </S>",
