    "technological advances in recent years have allowed the fabrication of electrical and even mechanical devices on the nanometer scale , where individual atoms or electrons can be manipulated .",
    "the physics of these devices poses a plethora of fundamental questions through a rich variety of novel quantum effects@xcite .",
    "this has led to an upsurge of theoretical interest in the physics of ` quantum wires ' , ` quantum dots ' and more general physics at the mesoscopic or nanometer scale@xcite .",
    "the effects of electron - electron interactions are typically enhanced in systems of reduced dimensionality , leading to nonperturbative effects , such as the breakdown of fermi liquid behavior in one - dimensional metals , and single - electron charging effects in quasi - zero - dimensional systems ( quantum dots ) .",
    "an important milestone in the nascent field of nanomechanics was the experimental discovery that not only the electrical but also the _ mechanical _ properties of metallic structures on the nanometer scale exhibit apparently universal nonmonotonic quantum corrections @xcite , which could be explained theoretically within the framework of a jellium model @xcite .    in the electrical domain ,",
    "paradigm systems to investigate mesoscopic behavior have long been small ring - shaped or multiply connected devices , where the application of a magnetic flux piercing the device leads to persistent currents . however , the theoretical prediction of these persistent currents , first in superconducting and then in normal conducting materials , has always predated experimental investigation , which has only become feasible in the last decade @xcite .",
    "very recently , with the discovery of a tunable kondo effect in quantum dots , the persistent currents of multiply connected systems with magnetic quantum dots - kondo rings for short - have aroused considerable interest@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore a very simple system , which may serve to model a metallic quantum wire ring with a weak junction , or _",
    "constriction_. it consists of the standard spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain , which by a jordan - wigner transformation is equivalent to a spinless electron gas in one dimension , where the exchange coupling is weakened at a single link .",
    "we use density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite to obtain numerical results on chains of up to 256 sites , and perform finite - size scaling extrapolations to the bulk limit .",
    "we study the spin stiffness , which under the jordan - wigner transformation is equivalent to the charge stiffness of the electron gas and is related to the persistent current , as a function of the weak link coupling .",
    "we also study the spin correlations across the weak link .",
    "eggert and affleck@xcite have previously studied the heisenberg chain with an isolated impurity using exact diagonalization and conformal field theory techniques .",
    "they find that in renormalization group language a single weak link across the ends of an open chain corresponds to an irrelevant operator , and therefore the open chain is a stable fixed point under such a perturbation .",
    "thus they predict that in the bulk limit a chain with a weak link will behave like an open chain .",
    "these findings for a concrete model system are in agreement with the general predictions of kane and fisher@xcite for the general one  dimensional interacting electron gas , i.e. the luttinger liquid .",
    "an integrable version of the heisenberg spin chain with defects has also been studied@xcite .",
    "the case of a single defect corresponds to a weak link .",
    "however , as opposed to the case discussed here where only one bond is modified , integrability requires a modification of two adjacent bonds and an additional three  spin coupling .",
    "although the defect of this integrable chain is completely transparent to particle scattering , the persistent current is renormalized by the defect strength .",
    "let us briefly review@xcite how the persistent current arises , for the simple case of free electrons .",
    "start from the real - space continuum hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an electron field with spin index @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the circumference of the ring .",
    "now thread the ring with a magnetic flux @xmath4 , producing an aharonov - bohm effect@xcite .",
    "the quantum phase @xmath5 can be encoded via a gauge transformation in the twisted boundary conditions @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the elementary flux quantum .",
    "when an aharonov - bohm field is applied , the hamiltonian acquires the usual interaction term ( we set @xmath9 henceforth ) @xmath10 thus for a constant field @xmath11 the corresponding  persistent current \" is given by the feynman - hellman theorem : @xmath12 which can be expanded @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the  charge stiffness \" .",
    "if we _ assume _ that @xmath15 is purely linear in @xmath4 ( as can be proved for the pure heisenberg chain@xcite ) , then the charge stiffness and hence the persistent current can be estimated from the difference in energy between the system with anti - periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath16 ) and periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18\\ ] ] the corresponding quantity in the heisenberg chain is the spin stiffness .    in section ii of the paper",
    "we briefly summarize the dmrg and qmc methods used to calculate this quantity . in section iii we present our results , and in section iv our conclusions are summarized .",
    "we study the spin-1/2 heisenberg quantum spin chain with a single weak coupling @xmath19 between two adjacent spins located between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath22 there are a total of @xmath23 sites in the ring .",
    "we study @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 $ ] , hence we have either open or periodic boundary conditions ( obc or pbc ) at the extremities of this range .",
    "we also consider anti - periodic boundary conditions in the same range of @xmath24 , to obtain the charge stiffness @xmath26 according to ( [ chargestiffness ] ) .",
    "the model in these limits is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz @xcite , and hence is often used as a testing ground for various dmrg methods @xcite .",
    "the quantities that have been calculated using dmrg include the ground state energy , the singlet and triplet gaps , and correlation functions .",
    "the `` infinite - lattice '' dmrg method @xcite is used here , applied with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lattice is split into two blocks and two sites as shown in fig .",
    "the weak link is placed between block 1 and site 2 . at any time the superblock consists of a system block and an environment block , plus two extra sites .",
    "the presence of the weak link destroys the translational invariance normally exploited in usual dmrg schemes , hence we can not simply make a copy of the density matrix in one block and transfer it to the other block . therefore in a single dmrg iteration ,",
    "two density matrices are constructed ( one for each block ) , and the basis set for each block originates from its corresponding density matrix .",
    "each block increases in size by a single site in a single dmrg iteration .",
    "we calculate results for lattice sizes @xmath27 to 64 , in steps of two .",
    "the quantities calculated here are the ground state energies , and the correlation of the spins across the weak link .",
    "the total number of density matrix eigenstates retained in a block was @xmath28 in the basis truncation procedure .",
    "we also carried out quantum monte carlo simulations using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) method@xcite . in this case",
    ", the spin stiffness can be directly calculated as the second derivative of the energy with respect to the phase , which is given in terms of the fluctuation of the winding number in the simulations @xcite .",
    "to estimate the accuracy of the dmrg , we perform convergence tests with @xmath29 , the number of basis states retained in a block .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows sample results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 with both periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we see good convergence with the number of basis states retained : in particular , for the ground state energy we have convergence to 1 part in @xmath32 .",
    "we obtained independent estimates using sse techniques for the periodic case , which yields @xmath33 , agreeing perfectly with the dmrg results .",
    "the correlations between the spins across the links have a marginally lower accuracy because of round - off error , but even here we have an error in the region of 1 part in @xmath34 .    since the sse method is a finite - temperature quantum monte carlo method we have to run the simulations at sufficiently low temperature to converge the quantities of interest to their ground state values . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we show the convergence of the energy and the charge stiffness for a 256-site chain .",
    "all sse results discussed below were obtained at inverse temperatures @xmath35 where the results do not differ , within statistical errors , from results at @xmath36 .",
    "ground state energies were calculated for the periodic and anti - periodic rings , as a function of the weak link coupling @xmath24 .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] shows dmrg estimates for the quantity @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 , for several different lattice sizes up to @xmath39 .",
    "an extrapolation in @xmath40 can be performed to extract the bulk limit for each value of @xmath41 by a simple polynomial fit to the data , giving us the extrapolated curve for the periodic and anti - periodic cases .",
    "it can be seen that for the periodic case the bulk values are approached from above , while for the anti - periodic case the limit is approached from below .",
    "putting together both the periodic and anti - periodic results for the energy , we can calculate the spin stiffness factor , given by @xmath42 the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . at couplings other than @xmath43 the values trend steadily down towards zero as the lattice size @xmath23 increases .",
    "there is a marked difference in behavior for the isotropic case @xmath43 , as the strong curvature towards zero is not apparent .",
    "one would naively expect to obtain a bulk limit by a simple linear extrapolation procedure , but in fact the work of woynarovich and eckle @xcite has shown that there are logarithmic corrections to the ground state energy , and hence the stiffness .",
    "we can see the effects of these corrections for the @xmath44 case , as there exists an exact result obtained by hamer , quispel and batchelor @xcite ( equation ( 3.37 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath45 ) @xmath46 this does not seem in accord with the data in fig [ fig7 ] , which appear to be approaching @xmath47 .",
    "a late , logarithmic downturn must therefore occur at very large lattice sizes .",
    "using field theoretical methods , eggert and affleck @xcite have predicted that a chain with @xmath48 should be similar to an open chain ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "this implies that the spin [ charge ] stiffness should vanish as the system size @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows sse results@xcite for the stiffness versus the system size ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) for several values of @xmath53 .",
    "the results are in accordance with a scaling behavior @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and the index @xmath56 . fig .",
    "[ fig8a ] demonstrates that the data for large @xmath23 can be well described , in fact , by a simple scaling form @xmath57 it is likely , however , that the true asymptotic correction - to - scaling behavior is again being disguised by logarithmic corrections .",
    "we have also calculated the value of the spin correlation function across the weak link , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the behavior versus @xmath59 for various values of @xmath38 .",
    "it can be seen that the finite - lattice values generally approach a finite value in the bulk limit , as one would expect , except for the special case @xmath60 where the link is open .",
    "theoretical expectations @xcite are that the correlation function should approach its bulk limit like @xmath61 , up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "the presence of a finite correlation across the weak link is just what one would naively expect when the weak - link coupling @xmath62 is non - zero . on the other hand",
    ", it might appear to contradict the previous statement that a chain with a weak link should renormalize to the open chain .",
    "the point here is that the weak - link correlation is a _ local _ quantity , not a bulk property .",
    "it is only bulk properties such as the spin - stiffness which scale to the value of the open chain .",
    "in summary , we have performed a finite - lattice study of the heisenberg ring with a weak link , using both dmrg and qmc calculations on rings of up to 256 sites .",
    "the spin or ` charge ' stiffness has been calculated either directly ( qmc ) , or from the energy difference between the system with anti - periodic boundary conditions and that with periodic boundaries , assuming a quadratic dependence of the energy on the twist parameter @xmath63 ( dmrg ) .",
    "the stiffness , and hence the persistent current , is found to scale to zero in the bulk limit @xmath64 , for any @xmath65 .",
    "this agrees with the renormalization group prediction of eggert and affleck@xcite , that the stable fixed point for this system corresponds to an open chain , so that the chain with a weak link will behave like an open chain , as regards its bulk properties .",
    "we have also measured the spin - spin correlation across the weak link .",
    "a finite antiferromagnetic correlation remains in the bulk limit , depending on the coupling @xmath62 as one would expect .",
    "the renormalization group argument does not apply to a ` local ' quantity such as this .",
    "the asymptotic scaling behavior of these quantities has been disguised to some extent by logarithmic finite - size scaling corrections .",
    "eggert and affleck@xcite have circumvented this problem by studying a modified model with an extra marginal operator ; but we have not found this necessary for our present purposes .    for the future , it would be of interest to see how the results generalize to more complicated and interesting cases , such as higher spin chains , or real electronic models , such as the hubbard model or its variant , the so  called @xmath66 model .",
    "another interesting extension of the present study would be to interpret the weak link and hence the modified bond in our model as caused by a mechanical force on a quantum wire",
    ". it would be interesting to see what conclusions could be drawn from our simple one - dimensional model for such a scenario .",
