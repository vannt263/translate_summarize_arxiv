    "owing to its size , proximity ( distance @xmath2 kpc ) , and long history of observation , the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) offers a unique opportunity to study in detail the components of a large spiral ( sb ) galaxy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present new disk - bulge - halo models for m31 that are ( 1 ) internally self - consistent ; ( 2 ) consistent with published observations within @xmath3 ; and ( 3 ) stable against the rapid growth of bar - like modes in the disk .",
    "our models are drawn from a general class of three - component models constructed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kd ) , chosen to fit available observations of the m31 rotation curve , surface brightness , and bulge velocity profiles .",
    "the models span a parameter space defined by the disk and bulge masses , flattening parameter and tidal radius of the galactic halo .",
    "one advantage of the kd models is that they provide the full phase - space distribution function ( df ) for each of the components .",
    "the dfs are simple functions of three integrals of motion : the energy , the angular momentum , and an approximate integral which describes the vertical motions of particles in the disk .",
    "this feature insures that the models are ( very nearly ) in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the kd models are each specified by 15 parameters . of these , 10 have a direct effect on the rotation curve , velocity dispersion , and surface brightness profile of the model galaxy .",
    "a search of this parameter space yields a set of models that fit the observational data to within quoted uncertainties .",
    "the data considered in this paper constrain the inner @xmath4 of m31 but say little about the mass distribution at larger radii . for this , one must turn to dynamical tracers such as dwarf satellites @xcite and globular clusters @xcite . recently @xcite derived an estimate for the total mass of m31 based on observations of satellites and outer halo globular clusters .",
    "their analysis assumed simple analytic forms for the gravitational potential of m31 and the dfs of the tracer populations .",
    "the models and methods presented in this paper may provide the basis for future investigations along similar lines and , in particular , a unified and self - consistent treatment of the full data set associated with m31 .",
    "two gravitational microlensing surveys toward m31 are currently underway @xcite .",
    "similar surveys toward the magellanic clouds have so far yielded inconclusive results .",
    "roughly 20 microlensing events have been observed toward the lmc and smc @xcite , but one can not say whether the lenses responsible for these events are indeed machos or simply stars within the magellanic clouds or milky way disk .",
    "the m31 microlensing experiments should be able to resolve this question .",
    "m31 is highly inclined and therefore lines of sight toward the far side of its disk pass through more of its halo than do lines of sight toward the near side .",
    "if the halo of m31 is composed ( at least in part ) of machos , there will be more microlensing events occurring toward the far side of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "previous efforts to compute theoretical optical depth and event rate maps for m31 assumed ad hoc models for the disk , bulge , and halo .",
    "our models represent a significant improvement over these models since they are both internally self - consistent and are consistent with published data on m31",
    ". we will describe how one can compute optical depth and event rate maps for the models constructed in this study .",
    "this paper takes the following form . in section 2",
    "we review published observations of the rotation curve , velocity dispersion profile , and surface brightness profile of m31 .",
    "section 3 provides a summary of the main features of the kd models . in section 4 ,",
    "we describe a method to search parameter space for models which best fit the observations .",
    "the results of this search are presented in section 5 .",
    "promising models are found which span a wide range in disk mass and in halo tidal radius and shape .",
    "we compute various properties of these models such as the disk and bulge mass - to - light ratios and the baryon mass fraction . for a subset of the models , we calculate the mass distribution and line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "we also fit the density profile to the nfw profile @xcite and thus obtain an estimate for the halo concentration parameter . in section 6",
    ", we describe a technique to construct theoretical event rate maps and present one example .",
    "our conclusions and a discussion of possible extensions of this work are presented in section 7 .",
    "our analysis utilizes published measurements of the galaxy s rotation curve , average surface brightness profile , and bulge velocity profiles .",
    "there is a considerable amount of m31 observational data of dissimilar quality available from the literature . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the data selected for use in fitting the kd models .",
    "rotation curves for the m31 disk have been obtained from optical and radio observations spanning various ranges in galactocentric radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an optimal combination of such data sets requires a good understanding of any associated calibration errors and uncertainties . in this study ,",
    "the composite rotation curve for the galaxy was obtained by combining velocity data from the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained velocities with estimated statistical errors of @xmath5 for 30 hii emission regions along the major axis of the galaxy , with galactocentric radii in the range of 625kpc .",
    "the @xcite measurements of neutral hydrogen within the gaseous disk of m31 yielded velocity measurements out to a radius of @xmath6  kpc .",
    "braun s data within 2  kpc of the m31 center were neglected here due to possible distortions arising from the presence of a bar - like triaxial ellipsoidal bulge . beyond @xmath7  kpc , measurements were obtained for spiral arm segments on only one side of the galaxy , hence data in this region were also not incorporated into our fitting .",
    "details of the rotation curve interpolation can be found in @xcite .",
    "both sets of rotation velocity measurements and their respective errorbars are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : rotation ] .",
    "kernel smoothing was used to form the composite disk rotation curve , which is shown with its rms uncertainties in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : rotation ] .    in determining the rotation curve of the galaxy",
    ", braun assumes circular gas motions within the disk .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of certain dynamical anomalies may lead to systematic errors in the rotation curve determination .",
    "such anomalies will be discussed at the end of section  [ sec : dbhmodels ] .      although there have been many optical photometric studies of m31 ( see , for example , table  4.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the task of combining such data sets is not straightforward .",
    "differences in filter bandpasses and resolution between the various studies yield systematic errors which are generally difficult to characterize .",
    "discrepancies in the adopted galaxy inclination and isophote orientation also contribute to differences in the light profiles obtained by different authors .",
    "for these reasons , we opted to avoid combining different data sets and instead adopted the surface brightness profile from @xcite .",
    "these authors produced a global light profile for m31 out to @xmath8  kpc by averaging the distribution of galaxy light over elliptical rings , assuming an inclination of @xmath9 .",
    "the inner parts of the galaxy are dominated by light from the bulge component , which itself has a significantly higher position angle ( pa ) than that of the disk : @xmath10 versus @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there is a distinct variation in the position angle of elliptical isophotes fitted to the surface brightness of m31 as one looks out in galactocentric radius @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a significant warp in the disk beyond @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these structural features can not be reproduced in the kd models and will thus contribute to fitting errors calculated for the surface brightness profiles .",
    "the dynamics of the bulge can be used to deduce the mass distribution in that component of the galaxy .",
    "we utilize the stellar rotation and velocity dispersion results of @xcite along the bulge major axis ( @xmath13 ) and minor axis ( @xmath14 ) in the fits to the kd models described later in section  [ sec : dbhmodels ] .",
    "the bulge data were smoothed using the same kernel averaging technique mentioned above ; the rotation and dispersion results are shown in figures  [ fig : brotation ] and [ fig : dispersion ] , respectively .",
    "@xcite noted several asymmetries in the rotation curves along various position angles of the bulge for @xmath15 , although the cause of these asymmetries was unclear .",
    "the kd models are unable to reproduce such asymmetries within the bulge ; we will return to this point later in the next section .",
    "@xcite constructed a set of semi - analytic models for the phase - space dfs of disk galaxies .",
    "their models have three components : a thin disk , a centrally concentrated bulge , and an extended halo . in this section",
    "we summarize the essential features of these models .",
    "the halo df is taken to be a lowered evans model @xcite .",
    "evans models @xcite are exact , two - integral distribution functions for the flattened logarithmic potential , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the flattening parameter . as with the isothermal sphere ,",
    "evans models are infinite in extent . in analogy with the lowered isothermal sphere or",
    "king model @xcite , lowered evans models introduce a truncation in energy such that the system that results has finite mass .",
    "the halo df    @xmath18          \\left ( \\exp\\left ( -e/\\sigma_0 ^ 2\\right ) -1\\right )           & \\mbox{if $ e<0 $ } \\\\          0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    has five free parameters : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the central potential for the system .",
    "following kd , the first three parameters are replaced by @xmath17 , a characteristic halo radius @xmath21 , and a core radius @xmath22 . in practice ,",
    "the latter is described in terms of a core smoothing parameter @xmath23 , which specifies the ratio of the core radius to the derived king radius for the halo .",
    "the df is independent of the sign of @xmath24 and may therefore be written as the sum of two components , one with positive @xmath24 and the other with negative @xmath24 .",
    "rotation can be incorporated into the model by varying the relative `` weight '' of these two parts as specified through the streaming fraction @xmath25 .",
    "the bulge df is given by the lowered isothermal sphere or king model @xcite , and takes the form    @xmath26 }          \\left (          -\\exp{\\left [ \\left ( e-\\psi_c\\right ) /\\sigma_b^2\\right ] }          -1\\right ) & \\mbox{if $ e<\\psi_c$ } \\\\          0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 govern the central density and velocity dispersion of the bulge .",
    "the cut - off potential , @xmath29 , controls the extent of the bulge . as with the halo",
    ", there is an additional parameter , the bulge streaming fraction @xmath30 , which controls the rotation of the bulge .",
    "the disk df depends on three integrals of motion : @xmath31 , @xmath24 , and an approximate third integral corresponding to the energy associated with vertical oscillations of stars in the disk .",
    "the disk df can be chosen to yield a density field with the desired characteristics . in the kd models",
    ", the density falls off approximately as an exponential in the radial direction and as @xmath32 in the vertical direction .",
    "five parameters are used to characterize the disk : its mass @xmath33 , the radial scale length @xmath34 , the scale height @xmath35 , the disk truncation radius @xmath36 , and the parameter @xmath37 which governs the sharpness of the truncation .    in a given potential ,",
    "the df for each component implies a unique density field . for self - consistency ,",
    "the density - potential pair must satisfy the poisson equation .",
    "this is accomplished by an iterative scheme as described by @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that the properties of the density fields of the bulge and halo are implicit rather than explicit functions of the input parameters . in particular , the masses of the bulge and halo ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) and the halo tidal radius ( @xmath40 ) are determined _ a posteriori_. likewise , the shapes of the bulge and halo are determined via the poisson - solving algorithm . in particular , the bulge is flattened due to the contribution to the potential from the disk .    by design ,",
    "the kd models are axisymmetric and therein lies the main limitation to the development of a truly realistic model for m31 .",
    "observational studies indicate that m31 can not be described adequately by an axisymmetric model .",
    "dynamical anomalies for m31 include factors such as the presence of a triaxial bulge @xcite , perturbations caused by its companions m32 and ngc 205 @xcite , the effects of significant variations in the inclination of the galactic plane as a function of radius @xcite , areas of infall motion towards the galaxy center @xcite , and local anomalies attributable to fine structure and shocks within the spiral arms of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "small local perturbations in spectra obtained through dust lanes in the central regions of the galaxy may also be a factor .",
    "these dust patches would have the effect of slightly increasing the local radial velocity measurements , thereby inducing local errors in the rotation curve of the bulge @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bulge dispersion may be affected by residual rotation caused by disk contamination along its minor axis .",
    "the kd models are specified by 15 parameters : four for the bulge , five for the disk and six for the halo .",
    "our goal is to determine the parameter set that yields a model which best fits the observations .",
    "this is accomplished by minimizing the composite @xmath41 statistic that is calculated by comparing the model rotation curve , surface brightness profile , and bulge velocity profiles with the data sets as described in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "unfortunately , the data considered in this paper are not sufficient to determine a global minimum in the full 15-dimensional parameter space .",
    "we therefore adopt a strategy in which a best - fit model is found for targeted values of the disk and bulge masses , flattening parameter , and in some cases , tidal radius .",
    "in addition , we do not attempt to minimize over the disk thickness , disk truncation radius , or halo streaming fraction ( i.e. , the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , or @xmath42 ) .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "the surface brightness profile at radii where the disk dominates is very nearly exponential . in the r - band ,",
    "the scale radius of the disk is @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath34 to this value at the outset .",
    "since the data used in our analysis have little to say about the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath35 , we set them to be typical values for m31 of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we assume that the halo does not rotate , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "we consider models with disk and bulge masses in the following ranges : @xmath48 @xmath33 is an input parameter but @xmath38 is a complicated function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and , to a lesser extent , the other parameters .",
    "therefore , to force the minimization routine to select a model with the desired @xmath38 , we minimize a `` pseudo-@xmath41 statistic '' that includes the term .",
    "the user - specified parameter @xmath49 controls the accuracy with which @xmath38 is fit to the desired value . of course , the physically relevant quantity is the @xmath41 statistic associated with the fits to the observational data , and this is the one quoted herein .",
    "4 .   as with @xmath38 ,",
    "the tidal radius of the halo is an implicit function of the other input parameters .",
    "therefore , for those cases where we wish to specify the tidal radius , an additional term is included as part of the pseudo-@xmath41 statistic in order to drive @xmath40 to the desired value .",
    "again , the user specifies the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the flattening parameter @xmath17 governs the shape of the halo potential and is specified explicitly .",
    "the shape of the mass distribution of the halo is determined implicitly through the poisson - solving algorithm .",
    "a given model is constructed by minimizing the pseudo-@xmath41 statistic for the fit .",
    "this minimization procedure is described in the next section .",
    "minimization of the pseudo-@xmath41 statistic over the multidimensional kd parameter space is performed by employing the downhill simplex algorithm ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "an n - dimensional simplex is a geometrical object consisting of @xmath51 points or vertices and all of the line segments that connect them .",
    "thus , a simplex encloses a finite volume in an n - dimensional space . for the case at hand ,",
    "the space is defined by the 10 free parameters as described above .",
    "an initial guess at the values of these parameters fixes one vertex of the initial simplex .",
    "the remaining vertices of the initial simplex are constructed by stepping in each direction of parameter space by some appropriate distance , which is typically set to 10% of the parameter value .",
    "the downhill simplex algorithm proceeds through a series of iterations as follows .",
    "the pseudo-@xmath41 statistic is calculated at each vertex of the simplex .",
    "the algorithm then reflects the vertex with the highest value of pseudo-@xmath41 through the opposite face of the simplex to search for a lower function value . if a lower value is found at this new location , the algorithm proceeds by testing the point twice as far along this line .",
    "the vertex in the original simplex with the highest pseudo-@xmath41 is then replaced by the reflected position with the lower function value . if a lower value is not found at the reflected position , the simplex is contracted about its vertex with the lowest function value . in this manner , the simplex steps through parameter space and gradually contracts around the point with the minimum pseudo-@xmath41 , thereby honing in on the best fit to the observed data and the targeted values for the component masses and/or tidal radius .",
    "the downhill simplex method has a number of advantages over minimization procedures that are based on gradients of the function ( e.g. , the method of steepest descent ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gradient methods appear to be more susceptible to the presence of local minima in the complicated @xmath41 surface .",
    "in addition , the simplex method is computationally efficient , requiring relatively few function evaluations .",
    "between 10 and 100 iterations are needed in order to locate a position in parameter space with the minimum value of pseudo-@xmath41 .",
    "an iteration requires between 1 and 10 function evaluations , each of which takes a minute or so of cpu time .",
    "therefore , a model can typically be generated within @xmath52 cpu - hours using a standard 1  ghz desktop computer .",
    "we begin with a survey of models in the @xmath53 plane focusing on the quality of the fits to the observational data , the stability of the disk , and the mass - to - light ratios of the disk and bulge components .",
    "we next consider constraints on the mass distribution beyond @xmath3 from dynamical studies of satellite galaxies , globular clusters , and planetary nebulae .",
    "we also check whether our preferred models are consistent with predictions from the baryonic tully - fisher relation and cosmological constraints such as the baryon fraction . toward this end",
    "we construct a series of models with tidal radii between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and also explore the implications of replacing the lowered evans halo of a kd galaxy , which has a sharp cut - off in density at the tidal radius , with an nfw halo .",
    "finally , we investigate models with flattened halos , such that @xmath56 .",
    "we have constructed and analysed over twenty m31 models in the @xmath57 plane with @xmath58 and @xmath40 unconstrained .",
    "table  [ tab : models ] summarizes the results for a select subset of these models .",
    "in addition to the disk and bulge masses , table  [ tab : models ] provides the composite @xmath41 statistic for the fits to the observational data ( column 4 ) , the r - band mass - to - light ratios for the disk and bulge ( columns 5 and 6 ) , the mass interior to a sphere 30  kpc in radius ( column 7 ) , the mass of the halo ( column 8) and the tidal radius ( column 9 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that there is a trough in @xmath41 running roughly parallel to the and centered on @xmath59 .",
    "both models a and d lie near the minimum of this trough while models a , b , and c trace out the cross section of the trough at @xmath60 . models along the minimum of the trough have low values of @xmath41 ( typically @xmath61 ) indicating an excellent overall fit to the observations .",
    "this point is illustrated in figures [ fig : a ] and [ fig : d ] where we compare the theoretical predictions for models a and d with the observational data .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for the gas rotation curve and inner velocity dispersion profiles along the galaxy s major and minor axes .",
    "furthermore , the exponential disk does an excellent job of fitting the surface brightness profile beyond @xmath62 though the fit is not as good in the transition zone between bulge and disk dominated regions of the galaxy ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "moreover , the inner rotation curve for the model appears to have the wrong shape : the model curves are relatively flat while the data suggest a rotation curve that is rising slowly .",
    "these two discrepancies may , in part , reflect the fact that our models assume an axisymmetric bulge whereas the actual bulge of m31 is triaxial .",
    "we note that the mass distribution in the bulge component of the model is flattened  but still axisymmetric  due to its interaction with the gravitational potential of the disk .",
    "the major - to - minor axis ratio is found to be @xmath64 , in good agreement with the value found by @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : a ] and [ fig : d ] help to explain the existence of the trough in @xmath41 .",
    "the contributions to the outer rotation curve ( @xmath65 ) from the halo and disk are both rather broad in radius and therefore one can be played off the other .",
    "figure [ fig : d ] shows that the disk dominates the rotation curve of model d for @xmath66 .",
    "this feature , common to all high-@xmath33 models reveals a fundamental problem with these models , namely a susceptibility to the bar instability .",
    "a dynamically cold , self - gravitating disk is unstable to bar formation @xcite and since a strong bar instability completely disrupts the disk , any model in which one is present is unacceptable .    in general , bar instabilities can be suppressed by an extended halo , a bulge that dominates the dynamics of the inner part of the galaxy , significant vertical velocities among the disk stars , or a combination thereof @xcite .",
    "we have performed a series of n - body experiments to test the stability of our models .",
    "we use the algorithm of @xcite , which has the advantage over tree and mesh codes in that the computation time scales as the number of simulation particles , @xmath67 , rather than @xmath68 .",
    "the simulations were performed with @xmath69 particles for each of the three components of the model and were run for 8 dynamical times as measured at one scale radius .",
    "model d develops a bar within a few dynamical times as expected given that the disk dominates the gravitational potential within a radius of @xmath70 ( see figure [ fig : d ] ) .",
    "model a , in which the inner rotation curve is dominated by the bulge and the outer rotation curve is dominated by the halo ( figure [ fig : a ] ) , appears to be stable .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ fig : nbody ] where we show face - on and milky - way observer views of the evolved disk - particle distribution for models a and d. further simulations suggest that the demarcation between stable and unstable models occurs in the neighborhood of @xmath71 .",
    "models with a disk in this mass range show signs of weak spiral and bar - like structures @xcite .",
    "the presence of spiral structure in the disk of m31 as well as a triaxial bar - like bulge suggests that weak instabilities operate in this galaxy .",
    "thus , @xmath72 should not be interpreted as a strict upper bound on the disk mass of m31 but rather as an interesting region of parameter space in which dynamical evolution may give rise to non - axisymmetric structures similar to what is observed in m31 .",
    "what we can say for sure is that models like d and k1 are violently unstable and therefore ruled out .",
    "conversely , model k2 may be so stable that the mechanisms which drive spiral structure are suppressed @xcite .",
    "model k1 assumes values for @xmath33 and @xmath38 from the popular small - bulge model of @xcite .",
    "this model does a reasonable job of fitting the surface brightness profile as well as the rotation curve beyond @xmath73 ( figure  [ fig : k1 ] ) .",
    "however , model k1 predicts a velocity dispersion in the bulge region that is too large .",
    "this discrepancy is common among all models with @xmath74 ( e.g. , models c and k2 ) .",
    "it is already evident in figure 3 of @xcite if one focuses on the @xcite data at @xmath75 .",
    "the discrepancy is worse for the self - consistent models considered here .",
    "kent assumed a constant density halo : when compared with a realistic model halo ( i.e. , one in which the density is monotonically falling with radius ) the contribution to the rotation curve from a constant density halo is relatively low at small radii . for a fixed halo contribution to @xmath76 at @xmath3 ,",
    "kent s model underestimates the halo contribution in the region of the bulge as compared with more realistic models .",
    "model k2 assumes values for @xmath33 and @xmath38 used in the pixel - lensing study from @xcite .",
    "this model provides an excellent fit to the surface brightness profile , matching almost perfectly the data through the transition zone between bulge and disk dominated regions of the galaxy ( figure [ fig : k2 ] )",
    ". however the model rotation curve appears to have the wrong shape between @xmath77 and @xmath78 and perhaps also beyond @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , the model velocity dispersion profile is systematically high , as discussed above .",
    "( note that in @xcite , where the density profile of the halo is taken to be that of a cored isothermal sphere , the model rotation curve provides a good fit to the data . )",
    "we now consider the disk and bulge mass - to - light ratio for the models in table  [ tab : models ] ( see columns 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the @xmath80 values for model k1 are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by @xcite , who found @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this agreement serves as a consistency check of our method though it is worth noting that kent uses the r - band filter of the thuan & gunn system which differs slightly from the r - band filter of the standard ubvri system used by @xcite ( see table 2.1 of @xcite for a comparison of the different filter characteristics ) .",
    "as expected , the disk and bulge @xmath83 values for the other models in table [ tab : models ] scale roughly with the mass of the corresponding component .",
    "in particular , the @xmath83 values for model a are approximately a factor of two smaller than those for model k1 .",
    "the values for model a compare well with the predictions from stellar synthesis studies .",
    "@xcite presented a correlation between the stellar mass - to - light ratios and the optical colors of integrated stellar populations for spiral galaxies .",
    "based on the relationships they obtained under different assumptions of initial mass function combined with typical m31 disk and bulge colors from table  1 of @xcite , one expects @xmath84 within the different regions of m31 .    despite this general agreement between the model mass - to - light ratios and the predictions from stellar population studies ,",
    "the question arises as to why , for all of the models of table [ tab : models ] except k2 , @xmath85 is significantly greater than @xmath86 . in general",
    ", one expects the mass - to - light ratio of the bulge to be comparable to , if not greater than , that of the disk ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "we propose two explanations for this apparent difficulty .",
    "first , the quoted @xmath87 values presented in this paper do not incorporate corrections for foreground extinction .",
    "since the effects of obscuration by dust are likely to be more severe in m31 s disk than in its bulge @xcite , this correction would drive down the @xmath83 of the disk relative to that of the bulge and bring the two values more into line @xcite .",
    "moreover , for typical sb spirals like m31 , gas contributes between 2 and 20% of the mass of the disk ( see figure 8.20 of * ? ? ? * ) and therefore boosts , by the same fraction , the @xmath83 value relative to the value for the stellar population . we therefore conclude that the values for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are quite reasonable .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to consider a second possibility , namely that the @xmath83 values obtained for model a reflect a genuine problem that is perhaps be connected with the poor fit to the surface brightness profile in the disk - bulge transition region ( figure  [ fig : a ] ) .",
    "deviations of the structure of m31 s bulge from a simple oblate spheroid may also have resulted in an underestimate of its effective radius in the fitting procedure , causing the bulge to get somewhat short - changed in mass .",
    "one might then argue that model k2 provides a superior fit to m31 .",
    "however , the gains in the surface brightness profile and the in mass - to - light ratios made by employing model k2 come at the cost of the quality of the rotation curve fit .",
    "model k2 also has the unusual feature that the bulge mass is greater than the disk mass , contrary to what is commonly found for bright sb galaxies .",
    "the total mass interior to a sphere @xmath3 in radius , @xmath90 , is provided in column 7 of table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "these values were obtained by generating an n - body realization of each model and tabulating the mass interior to the prescribed sphere .",
    "@xmath90 is constrained almost entirely by the outer rotation curve : a circular rotation speed at @xmath3 of @xmath91 ( an average of the outer 4 points in figure  [ fig : rotation ] ) corresponds to a mass estimate @xmath92 .",

    "similar results have been obtained from analyses of microwave background anisotropy measurements .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath153 for data from the boomerang experiment . with values of @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    "( the latter is also from @xcite ) one finds @xmath156 , the baryon fraction of the universe .",
    "this result is consistent with estimates of the gas fraction in x - ray clusters @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : rotationr ] and [ fig : mvsr ] and the results for the baryon fraction in models a and e point to a potential problem with using lowered evans models for the halo of m31 .",
    "the baryon fraction for model a ( @xmath157 ) is too high .",
    "moreover , the total mass of m31 in model a falls in the lower range of acceptable values based on the dynamics of satellites and globular clusters .",
    "model e does better on both counts but its rotation curve provides a poor fit to the data .",
    "these difficulties no doubt arise from the fact that the lowered evans models employed in the current implementation of the kd algorithm incorporate a sharp cut - off in density at the tidal radius .",
    "a natural alternative is to use a model halo whose density profile falls off more gradually with radius . such a substitution is consistent with our current understanding of structure formation . in the hierarchical clustering scenario ,",
    "each halo is a subsystem of a larger halo and in this sense , the lowered evans models are unphysical .",
    "n - body simulations based on the cold dark matter model of structure formation suggest that the density profiles of dark matter halos have a simple universal shape .",
    "this result was first noticed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) who found that the spherically averaged density profiles of halos in their simulations , which spanned four orders of magnitude in mass , could be fitted by a function of the form @xmath158 here @xmath159 and @xmath160 are free parameters which characterize the radius and density in the transition region between the @xmath161 central cusp and the @xmath162 outer halo . while there has been some debate over the slope of the density profile at small radii",
    ", there is widespread agreement that the nfw profile captures the general features of dark matter halos in cosmological simulations .",

    ", we vary @xmath159 and @xmath160 in eq.[eq : nfw ] so as to minimize the rms deviation between the halo contribution to the rotation curve for the kd model and the rotation curve derived from nfw ( eq.[eq : nfw ] ) .",
    "since our models were designed to fit rotation curve and velocity dispersion data for @xmath165 , only this range in @xmath166 is used to determine the `` best - fit '' nfw model .",

    "we see that for the range in radius probed by the data considered in this paper , the rotation curve of an nfw model can be matched closely to the halo contribution to the rotation curve for our models",
    ". moreover , the values obtained for @xmath99 are consistent with what is predicted by the cosmological simulations @xcite .    not surprisingly , the halo profiles for the kd models differ significantly from the nfw profile at small and large radii .",
    "the lowered evans models have a constant density core whereas the nfw models have an @xmath161 cusp .",
    "the halos in the self - consistent models develop a weak cusp but the slope is closer to @xmath167 than to @xmath168 . however , the discrepancy in mass at small radii between the two models is actually quite small : at @xmath169 , the cumulative mass for the nfw model exceeds that of the kd model by an amount @xmath170 .",
    "the discrepancy at large radii is more interesting .",
    "the lowered evans models have a sharp cut - off in density whereas the nfw profile falls off as @xmath162 .",
    "the discrepancy at large radii is especially apparent in model a where @xmath100 is nearly a factor of @xmath171 larger than @xmath40 and @xmath101 is a factor of @xmath140 larger than @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nfw ] suggests a resolution to the baryon fraction problem discussed above , namely to replace the halo in model a with an nfw profile selected to match the rotation curve within @xmath172 .",
    "the excellent overall fit to the data is retained and the baryon fraction is brought down to a value comfortably within the range predicted by cosmology . at this stage ,",
    "a cautionary remark is in order .",
    "the kd models , by design , describe dynamically self - consistent systems and one can not simply substitute a different halo with an nfw profile without spoiling the self - consistency .",
    "several authors have derived dfs for nfw models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which , with some modification , could be incorporated into future implementations of the kd algorithm .",
    "our final set of models explores variations in the shape of the dark halo .",
    "results for two of these models are provided in table [ tab : qmodels ] . for model",
    "q1 , we set @xmath173 and leave @xmath40 unconstrained , whereas for model q2 the target value of @xmath40 is set to be @xmath174 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 where as before we present @xmath41 ( column 3 ) , @xmath40 ( column 4 ) , and @xmath39 ( column 5 ) .",
    "we also provide @xmath175 , an effective flattening parameter for the mass distribution ( column 6 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath175 is calculated by taking the ratio of the mass moments along the short and long axes .",
    "it differs from @xmath17 for two reasons .",
    "first , the halo `` responds '' to the disk through the poisson - solving algorithm of kd .",
    "thus , even for @xmath58 , the mass distribution is flattened slightly and @xmath176 .",
    "second , @xmath175 reflects the mass distribution which tends to be more aspherical than the gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , @xmath177 for models q1 and q2 .    flattened models appear to favor smaller tidal radii . model q1 , for example , provides an excellent fit to the data but assumes a tidal radius that is very small .",
    "this model is probably inconsistent with observations of satellites beyond @xmath3 .",
    "model q2 has a somewhat larger tidal radius but , as with model e , the fit to the rotation curve is significantly degraded ( figure [ fig : rotationq ] ) .",
    "gravitational microlensing is an attractive means by which to detect machos in the halo of our galaxy and the halos of our nearest neighbors .",
    "results from the 5.7-year lmc data set of the macho collaboration suggest that a significant new component of the galaxy  namely one composed of machos  has been discovered @xcite .",
    "the macho collaboration detected 13 - 17 microlensing events , a number too large to be accounted for by known populations . within the context of a specific halo model ,",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis yields an estimate for the macho halo fraction of @xmath178 with the most likely macho mass to be between @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this result is puzzling since it requires rather extreme assumptions about star formation and galaxy formation .",
    "moreover , the result is in conflict with the upper limits on the halo mass fraction found by the eros collaboration @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the lenses responsible for the observed microlensing events are in the magellanic clouds or in the galactic disk rather than the galactic halo .    microlensing surveys toward m31 have the potential to resolve this question .",
    "the main advantage of looking to m31 is that one can probe a variety of lines of sight across the m31 disk and bulge and through its halo .",
    "in particular , a massive spherical halo of machos will yield more events toward the far side of the disk than toward the near side .",
    "this front - back asymmetry is an unambiguous signature of a macho halo @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have computed theoretical event rate maps @xcite assuming an ad hoc model for the disk , bulge , and halo of m31 .",
    "only cursory attempts were made to insure that the models are dynamically self - consistent . in this",
    "regard , our models represent an improvement over the models considered in the aforementioned papers .    following @xcite we consider the quantity @xmath181 , the number of concurrent events per area on the sky .",
    "this quantity is roughly the product of the optical depth ( number of concurrent events per source star ) and the surface density of sources , and is more closely aligned with what the experiments measure than the optical depth . as with the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ,",
    "the n - body representation of the kd models allows one to calculate theoretical optical depth and event rate maps quickly and efficiently .",
    "the quantity @xmath181 is evaluated by performing a double integral over source and lens distributions :    @xmath182    where @xmath183 is the number density of sources a distance @xmath184 from the observer , @xmath185 is the mass density in lenses a distance @xmath186 from the observer , and @xmath187 is the mass of the lens . given an n - body representation of a galaxy , this integral may be evaluated by performing the double sum :    @xmath188    the map of the number of concurrent events per arcmin@xmath189 for model a is shown in figure [ fig : optical_a ] .    the differential event rate ( number of events per unit time as a function of duration and position across the m31 disk ) may be calculated in a similar manner .",
    "a semi - analytic calculation , on the other hand , involves multidimensional integrals which may be prohibitively complicated depending on the functional form of the dfs .",
    "the models for m31 presented in this paper are dynamically self - consistent , consistent with published observations , and stable against the rapid growth of bar - like modes in the disk . to the best of our knowledge , no other model of a disk galaxy satisfies these three criteria to the extent considered in this paper .",
    "although kd constructed models for the milky - way that are dynamically self - consistent , stable , and have roughly the correct rotation curve , they did not attempt to fit their model to other types of data such as the surface brightness profile .",
    "our models span a wide range in halo size and shape .",
    "the most successful models assume a bulge mass that is nearly a factor of two smaller than the oft - quoted value from @xcite .",
    "our galaxy model with @xmath190 and @xmath191 provides a good overall fit to observational data , yields mass - to - light ratios that are quite acceptable , and appears to be stable against bar formation .",
    "this disruptive bar instability becomes more apparent in the models with more massive disks , such as the model proposed by @xcite . at the other extreme",
    "lies the model of @xcite , having @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "although their model is extremely stable against bar formation and reproduces the surface brightness profile nicely within the disk - bulge transition zone , the m31 rotation curve and inner velocity dispersion profile it provides do not fit the data at all well .",
    "the favored model in our study is found to yield a poor match of the estimated baryon fraction with cosmological predictions , and it falls somewhat short of the total galaxy mass at large radii as determined from observations of dynamical tracers . forcing a larger tidal radius ( @xmath194kpc ) improves these at the cost of the rotation curve fit .",
    "we attribute this failure to the form of the lowered evans halo df utilized in the kd algorithm , and propose the use of a halo df that falls off more gradually with radius .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that if the halo of model a is replaced by an appropriate nfw profile , the cosmological constraints are satisfied while the quality of the fit to the observational data is maintained .",
    "several improvements in the models are possible .",
    "for example , one can incorporate additional components of the galaxy such as a central black hole , thick disk , and stellar halo .",
    "the most serious drawback of the models is that they are axisymmetric and therefore can not capture important aspects of m31 such as spiral structure and triaxiality of the bulge .",
    "our models can serve as a starting point for investigations of these phenomena .",
    "in particular , models with @xmath195 will be studies using numerical simulations to see if we can produce spiral structure and a barlike bulge similar to what is observed in m31 .",
    "the methods described in this paper are completely general .",
    "when additional data become available , the algorithm can be rerun to determine a new suite of best - fit models .",
    "one extension that is soon to be implemented is the inclusion of a distribution of test - particles that are designed to represent a population of dynamical tracers such as globular clusters or satellite galaxies . in principle",
    ", the additional information from observations of these populations can constrain the extent and shape of the halo .",
    "the input parameters for the kd algorithm are provided in table  [ tab : kdpars ] for the models presented in this paper .",
    "the parameters are as discussed in the text .",
    "the unit of length is @xmath45 and the unit of velocity is @xmath196 .",

    "<S> we present a suite of semi - analytic disk - bulge - halo models for the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) which satisfy three fundamental conditions : ( 1 ) internal self - consistency ; ( 2 ) consistency with observational data ; and ( 3 ) stability of the disk against the formation of a central bar . </S>",
    "<S> the models are chosen from a set first constructed by kuijken and dubinski . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an algorithm to search the parameter space for this set in order to best match observations of the m31 rotation curve , inner velocity dispersion profile , and surface brightness profile . </S>",
    "<S> models are obtained for a large range of bulge and disk masses ; we find that the disk mass must be @xmath0 and that the preferred value for the bulge mass is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> n - body simulations are carried out to test the stability of our models against the formation of a bar within the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the baryon fraction and halo concentration parameter for a subset of our models and show that the results are consistent with the predictions from cosmological theories of structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we describe how gravitational microlensing surveys and dynamical studies of globular clusters and satellites can further constrain the models . </S>"
