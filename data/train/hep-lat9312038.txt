    "a very active subfield in high energy physics recently is the study of hadrons with heavy - light quark content @xcite .",
    "a major effort has been spent in calculating the isgur - wise function , which , once it is determined , can be widely used in calculations of heavy meson decay ( @xmath1 ) processes . after an initial exploration @xcite , calculations of the isgur - wise function on the lattice",
    "@xcite have quickly obtained interesting results which can be directly compared with experimental data and can be used to determine one of the elements of the ckm matrix , @xmath2 , in the standard model .    for calculating the isgur - wise function , @xmath3 , on the lattice ,",
    "we have proposed @xcite to use the flavor symmetry of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqeft ) @xcite and measure the @xmath4 elastic scattering matrix element @xmath5 where @xmath6 is d meson mass , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are four - velocities of the initial and final d mesons .",
    "the constant @xmath9 represents the qcd renormalization effect from the heavy quark scale to a light scale @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation was performed in the quenched approximation using wilson fermions .",
    "both light and heavy quarks are treated as propagating . for details of the numerical simulation , refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "from the lattice point of view , calculating the elastic scattering matrix element has significant advantages . in comparison to the @xmath11 process",
    ", the elastic process on the lattice has much less noise and therefore has smaller statistical errors .",
    "furthermore , because of the exactly known value @xmath12 at the `` zero recoil '' point @xmath13 , the lattice artifacts that are independent of momentum can be removed without ambiguity using eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) as normalization condition for lattice data @xcite . a similar strategy for @xmath11 decay",
    "would have introduced an extra ( unknown ) @xmath14 correction .",
    "therefore , not surprisingly , the most accurate data obtained so far on the lattice are from @xmath4 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "however , inelastic processes , such as @xmath11 and @xmath15 , can be valuable consistency checks @xcite .",
    "for analysis of the systematic errors , let us consider the slope , @xmath16 , of the isgur - wise function at @xmath17 .",
    "a fit of the lattice data @xcite to the relativistic harmonic oscillator model @xcite @xmath18~ , \\label{eq : nr}\\ ] ] gives @xmath19 . for a model independent determination of @xmath16 , one may choose to fit @xmath20 near @xmath21 @xmath22 and obtain @xcite @xmath23 .",
    "all the fits have taken account of the correlations between data points using covariance matrices .",
    "there are several potential sources of systematic corrections : quenching , scaling violation , light quark mass @xmath24 dependence , finite volume effect , heavy quark mass @xmath25 dependence .    _ quenching .",
    "_ the error due to quenching is the most difficult to quantify .",
    "although the effect is expected to be small if a scale such as @xmath26 is set to the physical value ( we use ref .",
    "@xcite to set the scale with @xmath26 ) , a systematic numerical study is still lacking .",
    "we will not give an assessment on the quenching effect here .",
    "_ scaling violation .",
    "_ since by using the normalization condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) all the momentum independent lattice artifacts are removed and the remaining scaling violations are proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we expect the residual scaling violations to be small . a fit to data at @xmath28 and @xmath29 found a difference of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .    a direct check on the euclidean invariance on the lattice is to measure the ratio of the form factors @xmath32 . this ratio was found small and consistent with zero within large errors @xcite .    _",
    "light quark mass ( @xmath24 ) dependence .",
    "_ our lattice data for @xmath20 are presented with @xmath24 set to the strange quark mass , @xmath33 .",
    "these data are directly relevant to processes such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 . for @xmath11",
    ", they have to be extrapolated to the `` chiral limit '' @xmath36 .",
    "an inspection shows that the linear size of the physical volume is in the range of @xmath37 @xcite , therefore , at @xmath38 the finite size effect becomes important and contaminates the @xmath24 dependence .    to estimate @xmath24 dependence we therefore use data obtained on the largest physical volume ( @xmath39 lattice at @xmath29 ) .",
    "we first estimate the shift in @xmath31 from @xmath24 to @xmath40 with both @xmath41 in the range of @xmath42 . then this shift in @xmath31 is extrapolated to the chiral limit . using this procedure , we find @xmath31 _ decreases _ by @xmath43 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sign of this shift is opposite to the chiral perturbation prediction @xcite and in agreement to the bag model calculation @xcite .",
    "it is important to confirm this trend in the future with improved statistics .",
    "_ finite volume effect . _ to estimate the finite volume effect , we compare our data on @xmath46 and @xmath39 lattices at @xmath47 ( @xmath33 ) . there is a shift of @xmath48 in @xmath31 .",
    "we expect that the finite size effect would be smaller at a heavier @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , the shift in @xmath31 is reduced to @xmath49 at @xmath50 .    _",
    "heavy quark mass ( @xmath25 ) dependence .",
    "_ recent lattice calculations indicated that the heavy quark symmetry begins to set in in the neighborhood of the charm mass .",
    "the leading @xmath51 dependence agrees with the expectations of hqeft .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for discussions of specific examples .",
    "therefore , simulation results obtained at the charm mass range can be used and extrapolated to the heavy quark limit . for the isgur - wise function",
    "the leading order @xmath51 correction should be @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "it should be relatively small for current lattice calculations @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , comparing @xmath31 at @xmath54gev and @xmath55gev , we find @xmath48 shift .",
    "_ summary .",
    "_ adding up the above items in quadrature , the total systematic correction becomes @xmath56 .",
    "we have @xmath57 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic error . for linear fit",
    ", we get @xmath58    we should point out that this @xmath56 systematic error is probably an overestimate .",
    "our fit in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nrfit ] ) and ( [ eq : lfit ] ) have been performed with data at all @xmath59 , lattice size , heavy quark mass values .",
    "therefore , the combined systematic error is unlikely to be much larger than the statistical error ( @xmath60 ) . indeed , though we use it as an indication of the systematic errors , the shift in @xmath16 due to each item discussed above is not statistically significant . to get a better analysis of the systematic errors",
    ", one needs more data points and better statistics . at this point",
    ", our discussion of the systematic errors should be taken primarily as a discussion on the methodology ; the estimates obtained are only qualitative .",
    "a comparison with continuum model calculations is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . clearly ,",
    "lattice result has reached similar , if not better , numerical accuracy as the continuum models for @xmath16 .",
    "our result for @xmath61 is also consistent with a recent lattice calculation by ukqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "although @xmath16 is useful for comparison with continuum model calculations , it is less useful for getting @xmath2 from the experimental data .",
    "around @xmath62 , experimental data have the lowest statistical precision @xcite . on the lattice",
    ", a model independent determination of @xmath16 also tends to have larger uncertainty because only a few data point close to @xmath21 can be used .    in argus ( and cleo ) experiments , what has been measured is @xmath63 with the most accurate data obtained in the range @xmath64 . in the lattice calculation , we have obtained @xmath20 in the range @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , at least in the range @xmath66 we can directly fit the experimental data with the lattice data with only one unknown parameter @xmath2 .",
    "one such fit is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we obtain @xcite @xmath67 where the first error is due to the statistical and systematic errors in the lattice calculation and the second error is from the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the errors on the lattice data essentially reflect the spread of @xmath68 over different @xmath59 , lattice size , and heavy quark mass values ."
