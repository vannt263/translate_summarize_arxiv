    "the most concentrated electromagnetic explosions in the universe  are believed to be related with the enormous energy release in compact regions on short time - scales .",

    "p plasma systems ( both of the astrophysical and laboratory variety ) , the fullerene plasma has a long enough life time that the collective behavior peculiar to the plasma state can be experimentally investigated under controlled conditions .",
    "the frequencies associated with the collective modes ( plasma frequency , acoustic and alfvn frequencies ) in such plasmas tend to be rather low .",
    "fortunately , the group of hatekayama and oohara have already made considerable progress in the production of the hydrogen , @xmath2 @xmath3 plasmas @xcite . since the initial report ,",
    "both the quality and quantity of this light pair ion plasma has been steadily improving @xcite .    since many properties of pair plasmas ( a symmetric pair plasma , for instance",
    ", can not sustain charge separation ) are different from the ordinary electron - ion ( e  i ) plasma , controlled experiments would not only advance fundamental physics , but also create a laboratory to simulate and understand a variety of phenomena taking place in astrophysical environments . a basic requirement for long - time - scale experiments , will be that the pair annihilation time scale is many orders of magnitude larger than the plasma period .",
    "theoretical investigation of pair plasmas have followed two distinct tracks :    \\1 ) the first track emphasizes the special properties that stem from the symmetric ( pair particles have the same inertia , temperature etc . ) nature of the pair plasma .",
    "this is a highly studied field @xcite both in the astrophysical as well as the laboratory contexts . in the e - p plasmas , problems like solitary structure formation",
    "are studied for instance in @xcite while for the ion pair plasmas much of the linear as well as nonlinear work has been devoted to understanding and interpreting experimental results ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in particular the dispersion curves , described in @xcite    \\2 ) the second group of papers deals with a whole lot of interesting phenomena that arise because the symmetry of the pair plasma is mildly broken through some mechanism which creates some disparity between the constituent fluids @xcite .",
    "one of the more interesting results of symmetry breaking is the creation of localized nonlinear structures ; the particular properties of the structure will , naturally , depend upon the mode of symmetry breaking .",
    "although it is natural to imagine that pair plasmas have to be symmetric : that the charges , densities , temperatures and masses of positively and negatively charged particles are equal . but",
    "both observations and experiments indicate that asymmetry may appear , quite naturally , at some stage of their evolution .",
    "in fact asymmetry could also be engineered in experiments if such a state could show interesting properties .",
    "different species , not produced in identical conditions @xcite , for instance , could have different thermal speeds ( temperatures ) .",
    "one could also arrange experiments with different setups for different species when , for instance , there are fractions of heavier / lighter ions or there is a mixture of different mass / temperature species with opposite charges .",
    "this way one could mimic the conditions pertinent to astrophysical pair plasmas .    a much investigated example of broken symmetry is a pair plasma contaminated by a small fraction of charged particles with different mass ( lighter / heavier than main species ) .",
    "symmetry breaking could also occur when the constituent elements of the two fluids have slightly different masses , or the fluids have slightly different temperatures .",
    "as expected , symmetry breaking induces new properties that are different from what pertains for pure pair plasmas .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that pair plasma , contaminated by the heavier immobile ions , can support 3d stable completely localized structures of em radiation ",
    "`` light- bullets '' , non - diffracting and nondisspersive em pulses of pancake shape with large density bunching .",
    "existence of such localized structures is not possible in pure pair plasmas .",
    "localized nonlinear structures of em radiation were also found in a hot e - p relativistic plasma containing a small fraction of cold electron ",
    "ion component @xcite .",
    "similar behaviour could be expected in doped ( or dust - contaminated ) fullerene plasmas in laboratory @xcite .",
    "the present study concentrates on establishing the existence of electromagnetic ( em ) solitonic structures in pair plasmas that could have been created due to asymmetries of different origin .",
    "we will work out the consequences of two classes of symmetry breaking ; asymmetry arising from a small temperature difference of the constituent species and the asymmetry arising from a small difference in the species masses .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be underdense while the em pulse is longer then characteristic skin length of the plasma . in electron - ion underdense plasma",
    "the formation of solitonic structures takes place only at the frequency close to the plasma frequency since in such plasma raman instabilities dominate the process of soliton formation .",
    "in contrast , in pure symmetric pair plasma , ponderomotive forces are same for different species and the excitation of longitudinal waves by the em pulse and raman instabilities can not develop . in slightly asymmetric pair plasmas the ponderomotive forces acting on positively and negatively charged species are slightly different ; the generation of weak ambipolar electrostatic potential takes place and the effects related to raman instabilities can be ignored to leading order .",
    "this potential plays a fundamental role in structure formation ; it acts as the binding `` glue '' that concentrates matter and radiation in a small region .",

    "then the standard treatment for a transparent plasma ( @xmath218 ) yields the following relations ( equivalent of ( [ eq : m-2 ] ) , ( [ eq : m-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : m-5 ] ) ) : @xmath219 and @xmath220 , \\ n^{+}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ 1+\\frac{\\delta^{2}+|a|^{2}}{(\\delta-\\phi)^{2}}\\right ] \\label{eq : b3''}\\ ] ] leading to @xmath221 @xmath222 = 0 .   \\label{b5}\\ ] ] for small mass differences @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) and for the characteristic length @xmath106 , the potential @xmath31 may be calculated to be @xmath225 explicitly displaying that @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath226 , i.e. , @xmath227 for @xmath224 ( compare with eqs . ( [ eq : m-38 ] ) and ( [ eq : m-43 ] ) ) .",
    "equations ( [ b5 ] ) with ( [ b7 ] ) , with appropriate normalization of the variables and inclusion of transverse field variations , constitute an nlse ( [ eq : s-6 ] ) with the following saturating nonlinearity function ( @xmath226 will be absorbed in the normalization ) : @xmath228 notice that this form of saturation nonlinearity function coincides with the one obtained in @xcite for e - p plasma with a small fraction of heavy ions",
    ". the reader may consult ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed analysis of the system ; here we will just summarize the salient features .",
    "equation ( [ eq : s-6 ] ) ( with ( [ eq : s-8 ] ) ) admits a `` spherically '' symmetric solitary wave solution .",
    "i.e. the `` light bullet '' , a concentration of mass and energy . and",
    "if the `` bullet ''  @xmath229 , this `` bullet '' is stable .",
    "these `` light bullets ''  are found to be exceptionally robust @xcite : they can emerge from a large variety of initial field distributions and are remarkably stable . the total plasma density variation associated with the soliton",
    "@xmath230 is large for @xmath231 ; the solitons with ultrarelativistic amplitudes create a large concentration of density .",
    "thus , the system of pair plasma with slight initial mass asymmetry between species supports the existence of long lived objects  light bullets which carry large amounts of mass and energy exactly the same way as the pair plasmas with small fraction of heavier ions @xcite .",
    "the saturating nonlinearity ( [ eq : s-7 ] ) caused by an initial temperature asymmetry seems to be of a new type ( vanishing for intense pulses ) ; it differs quite fundamentally from the one found in @xcite ( identical to the one originating in a initial mass asymmetry ) .",
    "one would think that the temperature asymmetry , manifesting finally as `` effective mass '' asymmetry , would be qualitatively similar to the initial mass asymmetry .",
    "but it is not so .",
    "fortunately we could trace the cause of the difference .",
    "the first step in the chain does appear to translate the temperature asymmetry ( see ( [ eq : m-1 ] ) ) into a difference in the `` effective masses '' @xmath232 `` . but in reality this ' ' mass asymmetry \" is dynamical and dependent on the scalar potential @xmath31 ,  @xmath233  while the one originating in an initial mass asymmetry ( @xmath223 ) is constant in space - time and never leads to heating / cooling .",
    "it is of utmost significance to realize that the electrostatic potential @xmath31 is important not only for maintaining the nonlinearity , but also to create dynamical temperature asymmetry for hot plasma conditions ; it is the latter consequence that may lead to qualitatively new and interesting phenomena in such a state of matter .    as a general conclusion we must state that the results of sec.v are valid only for cold plasmas . for initially hot plasmas one must take into account the temperature inhomogeneity effects ( discussed earlier in the paper ) that change the nature of the nonlinearity and hence the localization characteristics of the em waves .",
    "however it is worth mentioning , that the main property of density bunching and energy localization is always there in pair plasmas with different type initial asymmetries ; it is just the character of localization that changes with origin of the asymmetry .",
    "the main result of this paper is that a fundamentally new type of saturating focusing - defocusing nonlinearity is derived for a physical system .",
    "this composite nonlinearity , originating in a small temperature asymmetry in the constituent fluids of a pair plasma , promises the existence of interesting structures that intense electromagnetic waves can acquire in such plasmas .",
    "we have discussed an illustrative example where different parts of a high amplitude pulse are effected differently - the simultaneous expansion of the peak region and scrunching of the wings imparts a flat top shape to the pulse .",
    "most consequences of this new type of nonlinearity are yet to be worked out .",
