    "ithe major galaxy mergers in galaxy formation inevitably leads to the presence of a binary black hole ( bbh ) located in the center of a giant galaxy @xcite .",
    "the following observational results provide possible evidence of the presence of bbhs : double compact cores @xcite , two broad - line emission systems @xcite , the x - shaped morphology of radio lobes @xcite , wiggle patterns of radio jets @xcite , periodic variations and periodic outbursts @xcite , and the orbital motion of the compact core @xcite . strong evidence for bbhs as linking some observational results , however , has not yet been found .",
    "clarifying the mechanism for the formation of bbhs is essential in the study of galaxy mergers in galaxy formation @xcite , in the role of black hole mergers in the evolution of supermassive black holes @xcite , and in the detection of gravitational waves at the phase of bbh orbital decay @xcite .",
    "is a nearby low - luminosity fr i radio galaxy and giant elliptical galaxy with a redshift ( @xmath8 ) of 0.0213 @xcite , and has the strong jet and counter jet that extend to about 100 kiloparsecs ( kpc ) which have been observed at radio @xcite , infrared @xcite , optical @xcite and x - ray waves @xcite .",
    "the orbital motion of the compact core in , which has a period of @xmath1 years , was observed with a position accuracy of 10 micro arcseconds ( @xmath9as ) by using phase - referencing very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) @xcite .",
    "several observational and theoretical studies have shown that the periodic flux variation and periodic outburst activities in the radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath10-ray light curves are associated with the orbital motion of a bbh in the center of the galaxies @xcite . here",
    "we report the detection of a signal periodicity in light curves from the compact core of , which indicates the presence of a very close bbh in the center of this object , and also present evidence for black hole mergers .",
    "we use a hubble constant ( @xmath11 ) of 71 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , the matter density ( @xmath13 ) of 0.27 and the vacuum energy ( @xmath14 ) of 0.73 in this letter , resulting that an angular size or separation of 1 milliarcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to 0.436 pc at the distance of 3c 66b .",
    "the millimeter - wavelength flux variation for was monitored every two weeks from the end of 2003 through to the beginning of 2005 at 93.716 ghz using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , and every four weeks from the end of 2005 through to the middle of 2006 at 86.2 ghz using the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) of the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) .",
    "these flux monitor observations using two - type millimeter arrays will enable us to eliminate any dependence on the characteristic features of each array , giving us more reliable and accurate results .    in the nma observation , and were observed as a visibility calibrator .",
    "also , the flux densities of each calibrator were precisely derived by observing and .",
    "phase fluctuations in the observation are caused by short - term variations of the excess path length in the atmosphere , which is mainly due to the time variation of water vapor pressure .",
    "since these phase variations cause decoherence in the visibility data , it is necessary to correct this loss .",
    "the decoherence factors at all observation epochs were estimated from the synthesized maps of each visibility calibrator @xcite . to accurately derive the flux densities of the observed object , the flux data at epochs with a decoherence of more than 20 % were flagged . and were observed for the bandpass calibration .",
    "the weighted mean of the flux density data that were estimated from each visibility calibrator was plotted . in the pdbi observation ,",
    "the flux densities of were corrected by observing and the compact h@xmath15 region , and/or , except on january 14 and on july 23 in 2006 .",
    "the phase and bandpass calibrations were performed by itself .",
    "we first investigated the contribution of large - scale jet emissions into observed flux densities .",
    "a map of with millimeter jets can be made by combining the visibility data obtained from the nma monitoring observations for all epochs ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "the total flux density of the millimeter map of 3c 66b at 93 ghz exceeds 500 mjy , while the sum of the expanding jet and counter jet is less than 24 mjy .",
    "we made the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the jet and the counter jet from our data and other data at different wavelengths , respectively .",
    "we found that these seds follow ( agree with ) a simple power - law synchrotron model , even though the flux densities at all wavelengths were observed at the different dates ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the observed flux variations of were dominated by the unresolved core , not by the expanding jet and counter jet .",
    "figure 2 shows the 3-mm peak flux monitor data obtained from the unresolved core of between 2003 november and 2006 august , and the spectral analysis results from these monitor data by using lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite . from these results",
    ", we detected a periodic flux variation on a cycle of 93@xmath161 days with a maximum - to - minimum amplitude ratio of @xmath17 , and non - periodic flux variation from the unresolved core .",
    "the variability timescale of the observed signal is shorter than that of the orbital period of about 1 year . due to the orbital motion around the center of gravity in a bbh ,",
    "the doppler factor for the emitting region is a periodical function of time @xcite , and the observed signal periodicity has a geometrical origin due to doppler - shifted modulation .",
    "compared to the intrinsic period , the observed signal period is shortened by the relativistic effect @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that the non - periodic flux variation may be caused by the non - thermal radiation in the flaring state that is emitted by a relativistic emission region not directly affected by a bbh ( e.g. , a shock in the knots of jet in the core that is not resolved with the angular resolutions of nma and pdbi ) .",
    "both the observed flux variation ( see figure 2 ) and the orbital motion @xcite were well fitted by a simple model of sin function .",
    "this result indicates that the difference between the apogee and perigee velocities will be small , and that the doppler boosting factor will be small .",
    "if they were large , the profile of the observed flux variation would be that of a spike like the periodic outburst activities in the flaring state .",
    "this indicates that the binary system in has a nearly circular orbit . as a consequence of the binary orbital revolution around the center of gravity , the observed signal period ( @xmath18 )",
    "is related to the orbital period ( @xmath19 ) by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is @xmath22 with the jet outflow velocity of @xmath23 and the light speed of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the inclination angle between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "the apparent speed in the relativistic jet is written by @xcite @xmath26 given the detected signal period ( @xmath18 ) of 93@xmath161 days , the orbital period ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath1 years @xcite , and the derived apparent speed ( @xmath27 ) of 0.30@xmath160.04 ( see figure 3 ) , the following physical parameters for an inner - jet outflow that has the effect of the bbh orbital motion found in were estimated from equations ( [ eq : period ] ) and ( [ eq : apparent ] ) ; a speed ( @xmath21=@xmath22 ) of 0.77@xmath160.01 and an inclination angle ( @xmath25 ) of 5.3@xmath160.8 degrees in accordance with the standard model for jet bulk motion .",
    "consequently , the derived doppler factor ( @xmath28 ) of 2.8 [ = @xmath29 is a small value that does not have a strong effect on the profile of the periodical flux variation .    the jet is presumably linked to the accretion disk around a black hole .",
    "at least one of the two black holes in a binary system will have an accretion disk .",
    "if both of the black holes have an accretion disk , the relationship between the observed jet and the two black holes is not simple . assuming that the observed jet is dominated by the accretion disk around either one of the two black holes , we show two schematic geometries of a bbh in figure 4 .",
    "the orbital motion velocity ( @xmath30 ) around the center of gravity can be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the intrinsic orbital frequency .",
    "the observed flux modulation by doppler boosting can be written by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intrinsic spectral flux density in the comoving frame , @xmath35 is the source spectral index ( @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 is the doppler factor including the time variation due to the orbital motion of the bbh , which is written by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is @xmath40 . from equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) , the observed maximum - to - minimum flux ratio can be expressed as @xmath41 by applying this model to the sin curve of the periodic flux variation caused by a bbh ( see figure 2 ) , an orbital motion velocity ( @xmath30 ) of the bbh can be derived from equations ( [ eq : doppler ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio ] ) , and an orbital radius ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath43 cm [ @xmath44 pc ] can then be estimated when @xmath35=0 .",
    "although an upper limit for the orbital radius could only be estimated from the core motion using phase - referencing vlbi @xcite , the orbital radius of a bbh can be directly derived by adding the periodic flux monitor data that we found successfully .    from two types of geometry of a bbh system shown in figure 4 ,",
    "an orbital separation ( @xmath45 ) of two black holes is @xmath46 ( see figure 4a ) or @xmath47 ( see figure 4b ) when @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the mass of the smaller and larger black holes , respectively .",
    "since the revolution period of a two - body problem with a circular orbit has a relational expression of @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the gravitational constant ) , the mass of the larger black hole ( @xmath50 ) is estimated to be @xmath53 or @xmath54 @xcite demonstrated a tight correlation between the black hole masses and the velocity dispersions of their host bulges , and @xcite then derived the relationship between central stellar velocity dispersions and black hole masses .",
    "based on this relationship , an estimated mass of @xmath55 @xmath5 @xcite is adopted as the total mass of the two black holes [ @xmath56 for 3c 66b , where @xmath5 is the mass of the sun . from equations ( [ eq : small ] ) and ( [ eq : large ] ) , the following basic bbh physical parameters were estimated ; the larger black hole mass of @xmath4 @xmath5 , the smaller black hole mass of @xmath6 @xmath5 , and the separation ( @xmath45 ) between the black holes of @xmath57 cm [ @xmath3 pc ] that corresponds to about @xmath58 times the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath59 ) of @xmath60 cm [ @xmath61 pc , @xmath62 au ] .",
    "this estimated separation is much shorter than that of a celestial object recently identified as being a potential sub - parsec bbhs by @xcite , revealing the presence of a very close bbh in the center of .",
    "the decay time of a bbh in the center of due to the gravitational radiation is estimated to be @xmath7 years using the following equation @xcite @xmath63 the estimated decay time is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "the model of galaxy formation based on @xmath64cdm indicates that there were a large number of galaxy mergers , which led to giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "centaurus a ( cena ) , which is the nearby radio galaxy and bright elliptical galaxy , has the prominent warped dust lane and gas disk in the central region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting that cen a experienced a recent merging event during a few @xmath65 years ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "3c66b is a giant elliptical galaxy within the cluster abell 347 @xcite and has the prominent face - on dust lane @xcite .",
    "these indicate that 3c 66b differs from quasars with active merging @xcite and is one of nearby radio galaxies that experienced the galaxy merging event . within a timescale of @xmath65 years",
    ", two black holes caused after the galaxy merging event would come closer to each other due to the dynamical friction and gas interaction , and then merge into one due to the gravitational - wave radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in conclusion , this shows a possibility that a very close bbh in the center of exists just before its merger into one black hole .",
    "the detection of strong gravitational - wave radiation is expected during the final stage of a black hole merger .    in this letter ,",
    "the following assumptions are adopted ; 1 ) the derived apparent speed of the jet is equal to the bulk flow speed ; 2 ) the jet axis is parallel to the binary angular momentum and is perpendicular to the accretion disk around a black hole by which the observed jet is formed ; 3 ) the bbh has a binary orbit with an orbital eccentricity of zero ( this is a circular orbit ) ; and 4 ) the spectral index is zero at around our observing frequencies .",
    "it is theoretically suggested that the pattern speed is slower than the bulk flow speed of the jet @xcite , while the study on the relativistic bulk motion in about 100 agns demonstrates that there is no clear distinction between these speeds @xcite .",
    "for instance , the ratio of these speeds for grs1919 + 105 was estimated to be 0.8 @xcite . as our estimated proper motion has an error of 15 % that is comparable to this uncertainty , the assumption 1 )",
    "can be considered reliable in this letter .",
    "the complexity of mergers and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) feeding may not support the assumptions 2 ) and 3 ) . to evaluate these assumptions , it is necessary to monitor the flux variation with higher precision as closely as possible .",
    "if these assumptions are not entirely inappropriate , however , our derived physical parameters are not significantly changed . since the synchrotron radiation from the agn core is expected to be optically thin or peak at around our observing frequencies , we adopted the assumption 4 ) in this letter .",
    "when @xmath66 as compared with @xmath67 , the derived physical parameters of a bbh in are changed at a factor of 1 to 3 . using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) including the atacama compact array ( aca ) that is used to obtain precise images of celestial objects with high angular resolution @xcite , the multi - wavelength profile of the periodic flux variation and periodic outburst activities of candidate objects can be monitored with precision of one mjy or better .",
    "the spike profile of the periodic flux variation will provide us with the orbital eccentricity of a bbh in and the relationship between the jet axis and the binary angular momentum .",
    "in addition , the multi - wavelength profile will improve our derived basic physical parameters of the bbh with high precision ; the orbital radius , the orbital separation and the masses of the two black holes , and the decay time .",
