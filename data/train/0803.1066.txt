    "one of the principal tenets of extragalactic gc research is that `` gcs trace the major episodes of star formation in their host galaxies '' .",
    "supporting evidence for this view includes the fact that the mean colours ( a surrogate for metallicities at old ages ) of blue and red gc subpopulations in galaxies are correlated with the host galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ; larsen 2001 ; strader , brodie & forbes 2004 ; peng 2006 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "further evidence that gcs may be used as proxies for star formation in galaxies comes from recent spectroscopic observations of the gc systems of early - type galaxies ( es ) .",
    "strader ( 2005 ) find little evidence of young gcs from a small sample of massive es , in agreement with previous studies using either spectroscopy ( cohen , blakeslee & rhysov 1998 ; beasley 2000 ) or the measured luminosity function with the assumption of a universal mass function for all gcs ( puzia 1999 ; jordn 2002 ) .",
    "by contrast , puzia ( 2005 ) find evidence to suggest that up to 30% of gcs in less massive es may have formed later than @xmath9 . whether these younger gcs formed in dissipational mergers or by some other means is presently unclear .",
    "the finding of young gcs in lower - mass ellipticals has found some support in results from ir photometry ( hempel 2007 ) , which in conjunction with optical colours promises to break the age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. , mould & aaronson 1980 ) .",
    "however , this technique is proving somewhat controversial ( larsen 2005 ; kundu 2005 ) , and the reliability of this approach needs to be fully tested both observationally and theoretically ( e.g. , salaris & cassisi 2007 ; lee 2006 ) .    notwithstanding",
    "ongoing argument about the use of ir photometry in age estimations , spectroscopy is still the method of choice for deriving ages and metallicities , and indeed is the only way to estimate abundance ratios and obtain kinematic information .",
    "the current picture from the spectroscopic studies is , qualitatively at least , in agreement with the `` downsizing '' phenomenon .",
    "massive ellipticals are old , passively evolving systems while their less massive counterparts continue to merge and make stars and gcs at later epochs . unfortunately ,",
    "spectroscopic sample sizes of gc systems remain small .",
    "most of the nearest massive es are at virgo distances which restricts samples to the brightest few percent of clusters on 8-m class telescopes .",
    "this not only places statistical limitations on the interpretation of data , but also raises the question of whether the most massive globular clusters are representative of the system at all ( e.g. , harris 2006a ) .    an obvious target with which to begin to remedy",
    "this problem of sample sizes is ngc 5128 , the nearest giant elliptical galaxy . at a distance of @xmath10 mpc , over half of the gc system",
    "is amenable to spectroscopic observations ( with the brightest third or so accessible to 4-m class telescopes ) .",
    "moreover , ngc 5128 shows extensive evidence for one or more recent interactions , including shells ( malin 1978 ) , a central , highly inclined gas and dust disk ( e.g. , dufour 1979 ) , and a stream of young stars in its halo ( peng 2002 ) .",
    "indeed , in view of all this recent activity in the galaxy , if the association between the gcs and field stars in ellipticals is to be understood , then ngc 5128 is an excellent place to start .",
    "peng , ford & freeman ( 2004 ) ( hereafter pff04 ) were the first to look in any detail at the spectroscopic ages and metallicities of gcs in ngc 5128 , building on previous work by van den bergh , hesser & harris ( 1981 ) , hesser , harris & harris ( 1986 ) , sharples ( 1988 ) and held ( 2002 ) . based upon spectra of 23 gcs with sufficient s",
    "/ n , pff04 found that the ngc 5128 gcs displayed a wide range of metallicities , and that the metal - rich gcs ( [ fe / h]@xmath11 ) had a spread in ages , with a mean age of @xmath12 gy . based in part on the results for the gcs",
    ", pff04 suggested that the ngc 5128 galaxy which we see today was assembled through the dissipational merger of two unequal - mass disks at @xmath13 .",
    "bekki & peng ( 2006 ) have modelled the same merger process to explain the kinematics and spatial distribution of its planetary nebula population .",
    "in this paper we present the first results of an ongoing spectroscopic survey of the gc system of the nearby e / s0 ngc  5128 , examining the ages , metallicities and abundance ratios of gc system in statistically significant numbers .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section  [ thedata ] we describe our candidate gc sample , observations and data reduction . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we derive metallicity , age and abundance ratio estimates for the gcs and discuss properties of the ngc 5128 gc system . in section  [ summary ] , we present a summary of our results and a discussion .",
    "a detailed analysis of the kinematics of the gc system is presented in woodley ( 2007 ) , and a discussion of the colour - metallicity relations will be forthcoming ( peng 2007 in preparation ) .    throughout the following ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 3.8  mpc to ngc  5128 ( rejkuba 2004 ) . at this distance , 1@xmath14 20pc .",
    "the principal goals of our spectroscopic survey were twofold ; to obtain optical spectra of gc candidates in ngc  5128 in order to increase the number of known _ bona fide _ gcs , and to obtain spectra for previously known , and newly identified clusters of sufficient quality for a metallicity , age and kinematic analysis of the gc system .",
    "we describe our observational approach in this section .      the wide angular extent of the ngc  5128 gc system on the sky and the large number of candidate gcs in our sample required high multiplex over a wide - field .",
    "these requirements made the 2-degree field ( 2df ) instrument on the anglo - australian telescope a logical choice .",
    "the 2df permits up to 400 spectra to be obtained simultaneously over a 2@xmath15.1 diameter field of view ( see lewis 2002 ) .",
    "the fibres are fed to two spectrographs with 200 fibres per spectrograph .",
    "each fibre has a @xmath16  arcsec diameter , matching well the ngc  5128 gcs which are unresolved at the median seeing of siding spring ( @xmath141.3  arcsec ) .",
    "our observational set - up is given in table  [ tab : setup ] .",
    "we observed previously known gcs taken from peng ( 2004b ) , as well as new gc candidates .",
    "these candidates were selected from the ubvri photometry presented in peng ( 2004b , see their section 4 for a detailed description of the selection ) , and augmented with the wide - field washington system photometry of harris ( 2004 ) to yield a master list of @xmath17 candidates to @xmath18 .",
    "we identified gc candidates from both sets of photometry using a combination of colour and morphological cuts that selected objects appearing slightly extended and having the colours of gcs .",
    "we also matched our catalogues with the x - ray point source detections of kraft ( 2001 ) and assigned a high priority to any optical counterparts since low - mass x - ray binaries are known to be associated with gcs ( clark 1975 ) .",
    "spectra for gc candidates were obtained between the nights of may 6 and may 11 in 2003 .",
    "two and a half nights were lost to bad weather and the remaining nights were clear .",
    "to maximise efficiency , our observing strategy was to first observe three `` shallow '' ( 3 hr ) fields which encompassed all cluster candidates with no spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "these data were reduced on - the - fly at the telescope using the 2df pipeline software 2dfdr ( taylor 1996 ; bailey 2002 ) .",
    "radial velocities were measured using 2dfgrs , which implements a cross - correlation approach against empirical template spectra ( colless 2001 ) .",
    "selecting by velocity ( section  [ radialvelocities ] ) , an essentially clean sample of gcs was then constructed with which we made two plate configurations for deeper ( 8 hr ) spectroscopy .",
    "some 40 fibres were allocated to sample the sky uniformly across the field for sky subtraction .",
    "a further 10 fibres were positioned @xmath19 ( @xmath20 kpc ) south of the galaxy centre along the major axis to sample the integrated galaxy light , but at the same time avoiding the prominent dust / gas lane in the galaxy .",
    "the 10 galaxy fibre allocations were crucial for accurate removal of the galaxy background from the gc spectra , and for synthesizing an integrated spectrum of the galaxy for subsequent analysis .",
    "the flux - weighted combined galaxy spectrum corresponded to a position of approximately 2.3 arcmin south along the major axis . adopting a v - band effective radius of 5.0 arcmin for ngc 5128 ( dufour 1979 )",
    ", this corresponds to approximately an r@xmath21 aperture .",
    "in addition , spectra common between spectrographs 1 and 2 ( from different plate configurations ) were obtained for 11 previously identified gcs spanning a range of magnitudes .",
    "this allowed us to estimate the internal uncertainties of our radial velocity and linestrength measurements .",
    "the sky and galaxy fibre allocations were used to remove the contribution from the sky and galaxy background from our gc observations . beyond approximately 10 arcmin , the flux contribution from the spheroid was minimal , and an averaged sky spectrum created from the combined sky fibres was subtracted from the spectra of gcs beyond this radius . for gcs projected interior to this radius , the galaxy spectrum obtained along the major axis was scaled to the position of each gc ( by fitting a smooth curve through a plot of the mean flux down each galaxy fibre versus radius ) and subtracted from each gc ( similarly , see woodley , harris & harris 2005 and pff04 ) .       .",
    "the distribution of objects with a mean velocity of @xmath22 are foreground galactic stars .",
    "the pile - up at 1200 are background galaxies and is artificial .",
    "[ fig : velocitydistribution],width=302 ]    preliminary radial velocities for all candidate gcs were obtained with 2dfdr as outlined in section  [ observations ] .",
    "we found no systematic differences in velocities of common objects between the spectrographs , however , during the observations , differences in the velocity zeropoints of order @xmath23 were observed between standard stars with different plate configurations .",
    "therefore , post - observing , gc velocities were re - determined with fxcor in iraf using 12 f  k stellar templates which doubled as lick standard stars .",
    "the velocity zeropoints of these templates were checked by cross - correlating them with synthetic spectra ( vazdekis 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "velocities were considered secure if they had a clearly defined cross - correlation peak , and a tonry & davis ( 1979 ) @xmath24 value @xmath25 .",
    "the velocity from the best - matching template was then adopted as the final velocity .",
    "we noted during the analysis stage that there existed resolution variations in these data of up to @xmath26 as a function 2df plate position .",
    "we verified that no systematic uncertainties were introduced in our measured radial velocities by smoothing all the spectra to a common resolution and re - measuring velocities .",
    "the only effect of the varying resolution was to increase our velocity uncertainties as a function of 2df plate position .",
    "it should be noted though , that for index measurements the spectra were smoothed to a common resolution ( section  [ lickindices ] ) significantly lower than the instrumental resolution of our setup .    the velocity distribution of all the candidate clusters is shown in figure  [ fig : velocitydistribution ] .",
    "as can be seen , the velocity distribution of ngc  5128 gcs is well separated from background galaxies and reasonably well separated from milky way foreground stars .",
    "following peng ( 2004b ) , and informed by fig  [ fig : velocitydistribution ] , we classify as gcs all candidates in the velocity interval of 2501000 . at the lower bound ,",
    "250 misses very few gcs . for the field stars in the ngc 5128 planetary nebula ( pn ) sample of peng ,",
    "ford , & freeman ( 2004c ) , which is free from contamination , only 1% of pn velocities are below this cutoff .",
    "however , fig  [ fig : velocitydistribution ] does suggest that some uncertainty in star / gc identification remains for cluster candidates with v@xmath14250350 .",
    "indeed , one of these objects could be clearly identified as a foreground star on the basis of its spectrum ( object aat304867 has v=@xmath27 , but exhibits strong molecular bands in its spectrum characteristic of an m - type star ) .",
    "another ( aat114993 ) has been identified as a star on the basis of _",
    "hst_/acs imaging ( harris 2006b ) despite its having v=@xmath28 ( though note the large velocity uncertainty ) .    in an attempt to quantify the level of contamination from foreground stars in this velocity range we ran kmm ( ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) on the combined velocity distribution of stars and gcs assuming two homoscedastic populations .",
    "kmm gave estimated means of 53 and 564 for the stars and gcs respectively , with a 50% posterior probability that an object belongs to either subpopulation ( based purely on its radial velocity ) occurring at a velocity of 290 . at 350 kmm",
    "predicts that the posterior probability that an object is in fact a gc is @xmath5 .",
    "this probability falls to @xmath26 at 250 .",
    "there are 25 gc candidates in the velocity range 250350 , and based on kmm we estimate that approximately half of these may be foreground stars .",
    "we note that this potential contamination from foreground stars represents @xmath29 of our gc sample .    in fig",
    "[ fig : compareeric ] we compare our velocities with those from the study of peng ( 2004b ) , observed with a combination of 2df and hydra on the ctio 4-m .",
    "we find good agreement between the two samples , but note a systematic offset in the sense of us - peng = + 35 , with a dispersion of 66@xmath30 .",
    "the dispersion is consistent with our mean velocity uncertainty ( 59@xmath31 ) , though the source of the offset is unclear .",
    "we have re - checked the zeropoints of our template stars and heliocentric corrections and find no obvious systematic error .",
    "we separated our velocities by the spectral type of the best matching templates ( f g & k types ; fig  [ fig : compareeric ] ) and find the largest discrepancy for f - type gcs ( us - peng = + 74 , with a dispersion of 77 ) .",
    "the g & k templates give offsets of 30 and 23 respectively , with identical dispersions of 60 .",
    "since the ngc 5128 gc system clearly spans a range of spectral types , it is possible that use of a single template for cross - correlation in peng ( m31 gc 225 - 280 ) may have led to systematic variations in velocity as a function of spectral type .    ,",

    "[ tab : gcs ] we list the velocities and co - ordinates of all gcs observed . the newly identified gcs are designated `` aat@xmath32 '' in table  [ tab : gcs ] , previously known gcs retain their previous designations ( see pff04 ) . for completeness",

    "spectra are shown at the lick / ids resolution ( @xmath33   ) .",
    "[ fig : spectra],width=302 ]      in order to compare our spectra to single stellar population models ( ssps ) , we calibrated them to the lick system ( trager 1998 ) using 12 lick standard observed with the same 2df configuration ( section  [ radialvelocities ] ) . the standard stars and the ngc  5128 gc spectra were smoothed with a wavelength - dependent gaussian to the resolutions given in worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "the lick index definitions of worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) and trager ( 1998 ) were measured for all spectra , and additive offsets from the lick standards applied to the gc data .",
    "these offsets were obtained by comparing our lick index measurements of the standard stars to the lick / ids measurements .",
    "straight additive offsets ( obtained using a weighted least - squares fit ) were applied since there was little evidence of non - linearity in the index comparisons as a function of metallicity .",
    "the total uncertainty in our index measurements was calculated as the quadrature addition of the poisson uncertainty , the repeat measurements uncertainty and the correction to lick uncertainty . for most indices ,",
    "the correction to the lick system was by far the dominant uncertainty .",
    "our lick index measurements are listed in table  [ tab : lickindices ] and index uncertainties are given in table  [ tab : lickerrors ] .",
    "before turning to ssps to derive population parameters , we wished to derive a purely empirical , model - independent metallicity scale for our data in order to rank the ngc  5128 gcs by their metal abundance .",
    "there is currently no metallicity scale which has been universally adopted in extragalactic gc research , but those which are used , derived either from integrated colours or spectroscopy , are invariably tied to either theoretical isochrones or milky way gc metallicities .",
    "we have chosen the latter route , and as a calibration set use lick index data available for milky way gcs .",
    "we used gc data for 41 individual gcs taken from schiavon ( 2005 ) whose lick indices were measured and calibrated to the lick system by mendel , proctor & forbes ( 2007 ) , and 12 ( lick calibrated ) gcs from puzia ( 2002b ) .",
    "the schiavon ( 2005 ) and puzia ( 2002b ) samples have 11 gcs in common , giving a combined dataset of 53 spectra for 42 gcs . since all the gc indices have been calibrated onto the lick system , they are directly comparable to our data",
    ".        to derive empirical metallicities , we obtained correlations between the lick index strengths and the harris ( 1996 , feb 2003 version ) catalogue metallicities of the milky way gcs ( see e.g. , perret et al .",
    "2002 ; puzia et al .",
    "the majority of these relations appear non - linear and we therefore characterised the relations with second - order polynomial fits , giving a metallicity estimate for each index measurement .",
    "these relations are shown in figure  [ fig : mwrelations ] and the polynomial coefficients and the rms of the fits are listed in table  [ tab : polynomials ] .",
    "all the indices , with the exceptions of fe5015 and nad , show clear correlations with metallicity .",
    "the fe5015 index is seemingly affected by poor sky subtraction ( schiavon 2005 ) , whereas nad is possibly affected by interstellar absorption . of the remaining 21 available lick indices we have chosen to use six indices : fe4383 , mg@xmath34 , mg @xmath35 , fe5270 , fe5335 and fe5406 .",
    "these indices all have high correlation coefficients ( table  [ tab : polynomials ] ) , low residuals about the fit , and have relatively small uncertainties in the ngc 5128 data .",
    "we avoided the cn and g4300 indices due the unknown role of mixing in the gcs and also the balmer lines which are affected by age variations .",
    "we also avoided the mg@xmath36 and ca4455 indices which show signs of significant flattening at the lowest metallicities .",
    "the individual index measurements were then combined employing a tukey biweighting scheme ( giving outliers less weight , although we note that weighted and unweighted averages yielded very similar results ) .",
    "uncertainties were derived robustly using the median absolute deviation scaled to asymptotically approach a normal standard deviation ( allowing the calculation of a standard error on the mean ) . between our final metallicity estimates for the milky way gcs and the harris ( 1996 ) values",
    "we found a scatter of 0.12 dex .",
    "we then proceeded to use the above approach to assign metallicities to the ngc 5128 clusters based upon their lick indices .",
    "experiments suggested that a s / n of 20 provided robust results , and we therefore took this as a ( fairly conservative ) minimum s / n for this exercise , leaving 207 gcs in the sample .",
    "this empirical metallicity scale is tied to the milky way gc metallicities listed in the harris ( 1996 ) catalogue which comprise a mixture of zinn & west ( 1974 ) spectrophotometric metallicities and high resolution spectroscopic estimates . however , the high - dispersion spectroscopic measurements in the literature are now numerous enough that for most milky way clusters ( including all the luminous , classic ones that we use below , for example , for lick index standardization ) these are the measurements that dominate the catalog metallicities . what exactly this metallicity scale measures ( [ fe / h ] , [ z / h ] or something else ) is a matter of debate ( e.g. , thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; mendel 2007 ) . here",
    "we simply regard it as the `` galactic gc metallicity scale '' . to reflect this ambiguous nature",
    ", we refer to our empirical metallicities as simply [ m / h ] , which are directly comparable to any other metallicities based upon those in the harris catalogue .",
    "furthermore , in the following sections we use the following notation : we refer to the harris ( 1996 ) catalogue metallicities as [ fe / h ] , [ z / h ] refers to our ssp - derived metallicities , [ @xmath37/fe ] signifies any literature estimates of the @xmath37-element over iron ratio , and [ e / fe ] is our ssp - derived ratio of ",
    "enhanced(@xmath37 ) elements over iron .    the empirical metallicities and uncertainties for the ngc 5128 gcs are listed in table  [ tab : gcs ] , and their resulting spectroscopic `` metallicity distribution function '' ( mdf ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] . assuming a total population of 1500 gcs in ngc  5128 ( harris 2006b )",
    ", this represents @xmath0 of the gc system . to show the influence of our choice of binning on the precise form of the distribution we show the mdf using three different bin widths of 0.17 dex , 0.15 dex and 0.13 dex .",
    "we also overplot nonparametric kernel density estimates using the same kernel bandwidths as the histogram bin widths .",
    "irrespective of the exact choice of binning or density kernel , the ngc  5128 gc mdf looks non - gaussian .",
    "we tested for the presence of metallicity subpopulations in the sample using kmm and the bayesian code nmix ( richardson & green 1997 ; see discussion in strader 2006 ) . using kmm in the 2-group , homoscedastic case , a bimodal distribution is preferred to a single gaussian with a @xmath38-value of 0 .",
    "nmix also finds that a ( heteroscedastic ) bimodal distribution is more probable than a unimodal one ( 45% and @xmath39% probabilities respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the gc system of ngc 5128 is convincingly multimodal in _ spectroscopic _ metallicity , reflecting the existence of at least two metallicity subpopulations ( strader 2007 , kundu & zepf 2007 ) rather than a single population ( yoon 2006 ) .",
    "it is also apparent that the empirical mdf of the ngc  5128 gcs is on average more metal - rich than that of the milky way gcs .",
    "a straight mean of the milky way gc metallicities gives [ m / h]=1.3 whereas the corresponding value for the ngc  5128 gcs is [ m / h]=0.87 .",
    "this result seems to be driven by two factors .",
    "firstly , there is a larger fraction of metal - rich ( hereafter red ) gcs in the ngc 5128 sample than in the milky way sample .",
    "secondly , both the metal - poor ( hereafter blue ) gcs and red gcs in ngc 5128 are on average more metal - rich than the corresponding populations in the milky way . in the bimodal case outlined above ,",
    "kmm ( nmix ) finds peaks at [ m / h]=1.34 and 0.52 ( 1.30 , 0.50 ) for the ngc 5128 gcs , whereas the corresponding values for the milky way gcs are [ m / h]=1.62 and 0.61 ( 1.62 , 0.63 ) .",
    "the blue gcs in ngc 5128 are @xmath40 dex more metal - rich than the blue gcs in the milky way .",
    "the red gcs in ngc 5128 are also , on average , slightly more metal - rich than the average of the milky way gcs ( @xmath41 dex ) .",
    "these differences in the average _ spectroscopic _ metallicities of the blue and red gc subpopulations between the two galaxies are broadly consistent with the positive correlation between galaxy luminosity and mean gc metallicity found photometrically ( larsen 2001 ; strader 2004 ; peng 2006 ) .",
    "in detail , the blue peak of the ngc 5128 gcs lies close to the upper envelope of the relation ( peng 2006 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) ",
    "i.e. more metal - rich than the mean relation  whereas the red peak lies close to the lower envelope of the red relation ( i.e. more metal - poor than the mean relation ) .",
    "since the peaks in the mdf lie slightly off the galaxy colour - magnitude relations in such a fashion , no correction in the integrated magnitude of the galaxy can bring better agreement . however , both population peaks in our data lie within the scatter of the photometric relations .",
    "we also note that the mdf the ngc 5128 gcs is _ narrower _ than that of the milky way gcs .",
    "the full - width half - maxima of the two distributions are 1.3 and 1.6 dex respectively .",
    "this seems to be largely driven by the blue peak in the ngc 5128 mdf which , being more metal - rich on average than the milky way blue peak , has been pushed into the red peak of the mdf .     of the ngc  5128 gcs for different",
    "s / n limits in the spectra .",
    "the lower panel shows the distribution for milky way gcs which is clearly bimodal .",
    "these ngc  5128 data exhibit a broad , perhaps trimodal distribution .",
    "[ fig : mgfe],width=302 ]    inspection of the ngc 5128 mdfs in figure  [ fig : mh ] suggests that there may be further metallicity substructure in the gc system . by eye ,",
    "peaks in the mdf are apparent at [ m / h]@xmath1 , 0.4 and also perhaps at [ m / h]@xmath42 .",
    "results for kmm in the trimodal case were inconclusive , but nmix found peaks at 1.43 , 0.87 and 0.38 with a 54% likelihood that there are three or more peaks in the distribution ( recall likelihoods of 1% and 45% were found for the unimodal and bimodal cases respectively . ) a test to check on the reality of this `` trimodality '' is to see if this is evident in the raw lick indices . in figure",
    "[ fig : mgfe ] we show histograms of the [ mgfe ] index of the ngc  5128 gcs compared to the milky way sample used for the metallicity calibration .",
    "we show [ mgfe ] because this index has higher s / n than most individual indices ( being a combination of three indices ) and it is thought to be relatively insensitive to @xmath37-abundance variations ( thomas 2003 ) the distribution of indices for all 254 gcs is broad and relatively flat . as the lower limit of the s / n of the spectra",
    "is increased , three peaks become increasingly evident . we note that similar behaviour is seen in other lick indices with sufficient s / n , such as the mg@xmath34 feature . by contrast , the milky way sample ( 42 unique gcs ) is clearly bimodal in [ mgfe ] .",
    "these results are suggestive that there may be intrinsic substructure in the metal - rich peak of the n5128 mdf .    , width=302 ]    the radial distribution of the gc metallicities",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : radial ] .",
    "the entire system shows a mild decrease in [ m / h ] with increasing radius as emphasized by the sliding - mean values .",
    "a linear fit to the gc data finds a gradient of 0.019 dex / arcmin ( @xmath43 dex / kpc ) with a large dispersion of @xmath44 dex ( see also woodley 2005 ) .",
    "we find no significant gradients in either the blue or red gc subpopulations .",
    "this being the case , the metallicity gradient seen for the whole sample must be largely driven by an increasing fraction of blue / red gcs with radius ( e.g. , perrett 2002 ; harris 2006b ) .",
    "one concern in using the milky way gcs as metallicity calibrators for extragalactic gc systems is the small number of milky way gcs with high metallicities . in the combined schiavon+puzia samples , only 5 unique gcs ( 10 spectra ) have [ fe / h]@xmath45 , with perhaps only ngc 6528 at solar metallicity . in order to give the reader an idea of the uncertainties in our metallicity calibration , we show in the bottom - right panel fig .",

    "kmm locates peak metallicities of 1.42 and 0.57 in the input sample , and finds peaks of 1.44 and 0.54 in the recovered metallicities .",
    "the mean metallicity of the sample does not change .",
    "therefore , within the metallicity range of the milky way gc calibrators , the empirical metallicity scale is fairly well constrained . for metallicities above solar",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : mgfe ] , very few ngc 5128 gc have metallic indices stronger than the most metal - rich milky way gcs , and therefore the exact behaviour of the empirical calibration beyond solar metallicity is not of great concern .",
    "the existence of star - by - star photometry of the giants in ngc 5128 allows us to compare directly the mdf of the field stars with that of its gcs .",
    "photometric mdfs have been constructed at projected radii of 8 kpc ( harris & harris 2002 ) , 20 kpc ( harris & harris 2000 ) and at 38 kpc ( rejkuba 2005 ) all determined from @xmath46 photometry of the halo red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars with the cameras on board _",
    "hst_. an obvious problem here is choosing at what radius the gcs should be compared with the field stars . in the absence of a compelling scientific criterium ,",
    "we have chosen to compare our data with both the `` middle field '' at 20 kpc ( @xmath3r@xmath4 ) from harris & harris ( 2000 ) and the `` inner field '' of harris & harris ( 2002 ) at 8 kpc ( @xmath47r@xmath4 ) .",
    "note that although both these field star mdfs are photometric and the gc mdf is spectroscopic , all are calibrated to the metallicity scale of the milky way gcs in the harris catalogue and are therefore readily comparable .",
    "we also note that our sample of gcs may be somewhat radially biased in the sense that the metal - rich gcs may be overrepresented .",
    "the kmm tests in performed in section [ metallicityscale ] find a blue gc fraction of 41% and a red gc fraction of 59% .",
    "from a sample of 300 ngc 5128 gcs ( of which 100 are from this present study ) woodley ( 2005 ) find that some 54% are blue and 46% are red .",
    "however , the true blue : red fraction will have to await a complete photometric catalogue .",
    "the comparison of the mdfs is shown in figure  [ fig : mdf ] . in the figure",
    ", the normalised density distribution of the gcs has been scaled by a factor of 1.7 to illustrate the close coincidence of the metal - rich end of the gc mdf with that of the 20 kpc field ( at [ m / h]@xmath48 . ) in comparison , the average metallicity of the 8 kpc field star mdf is some 0.2 dex more metal rich than the gcs .",
    "some @xmath49 of the rgb stars in the 8 kpc field are more metal - rich than solar .",
    "this is probably only a lower limit since incompleteness effects due to problems in dealing with the reddest rgb stars mean that the most metal - rich stars in the mdf are probably underrepresented ( harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , considering that the inner stellar field is at a galactocentric radius of @xmath47r@xmath4 , we might expect even more metal - rich stars in the central regions of the galaxy than are seen in the 8 kpc mdf .",
    "in contrast , few of the gcs in our sample are convincingly super - solar in metallicity ; the most metal - rich gcs in ngc 5128 have comparable metal - line strengths to the most metal - rich milky way gcs in the schiavon ( 2005 ) and puzia ( 2002 ) samples ( ngc 6528 and ngc 6553 ) .",
    "so , although our gc sample is by no means complete in the inner regions of ngc 5128 , it presently appears that a significant fraction of the galaxy stars were able to obtain levels of heavy - element enrichment substantially higher than any of its gcs .",
    "the other principal feature in the comparison of the mdfs is , as discussed by harris & harris ( 2000 ; 2002 ) , that the number ratio of gc to stars varies considerably with metallicity .",
    "no more than 10% of the stellar mdf is more metal - poor than [ m / h]@xmath50 , whereas 40% of the gcs are more metal - poor than [ m / h]@xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the ratio of efficiencies of metal - poor gcs to metal - poor stars is significantly higher than the corresponding metal - rich ratio , and/or the dynamical destruction efficiency of metal - poor gcs is considerably lower than that of their metal - rich counterparts . from the r@xmath21 integrated spectrum of the galaxy itself , we derive a mean metallicity of [ m / h]=@xmath51 , in agreement with the metallicities found by harris & harris ( 2002 ) .     to illustrate the similarities between the metal - rich ends of the distributions .",
    "the solid square represents the metallicity derived from the r@xmath21 integrated spectrum of ngc 5128 using our empirical metallicity calibration .",
    "[ fig : mdf],width=302 ]    in constructing the ngc  5128 gc mdf with an empirical metallicity calibration tied to milky way gcs , we have made the implicit assumptions that the ngc  5128 gcs have ages and abundance ratios comparable to the milky way gcs .",
    "these assumptions are tested in the following section where we estimate ages , metallicities and abundance ratios for a higher s / n subset of gcs using ssp models .",
    "estimating ages , metallicities and abundance ratios from the integrated spectra of gcs requires the use of single - burst stellar population models ( ssps ) .",
    "however , as becomes readily apparent from the extensive literature on the subject , such parameter estimates remain model dependent .    motivated by the studies of proctor , forbes & beasley ( 2004 ) and mendel ( 2007 ) , who compared ssp - derived ages , metallicities and abundance ratios with literature estimates for milky way gcs , we used two different sets of ssps .",
    "we used the lee & worthey ( 2005 ) models ( henceforth lw05 models ) and the thomas ( 2003 ) models , augmented with the higher order balmer - line calculations of thomas , maraston & korn ( 2004 ) ( henceforth collectively referred to as tmk04 models ) .",
    "mendel ( 2007 ) showed that the lw05 models , when corrected for non - solar abundance ratios ( nsars ) using the fractional sensitivities of houdashelt ( 2002 ; hereafter h02 ) , and the tmk04 models are able to reproduce the ages , metallicities and [ @xmath37/fe ] ratios for milky way gcs with [ fe / h]@xmath52 quite well .",
    "the lw05 models were particularly successful at recovering the [ @xmath37/fe ] patterns of milky way gcs found from high resolution spectroscopic estimates ( e.g. , pritzl 2005 ) . at metallicities approaching the solar value ,",
    "mendel ( 2007 ) found some evidence that the lw05 models underestimate the ages of mw gcs . in the case of the tmk04 ssps ,",

    "we note that neither of these models has been well tested in the intermediate and young age regime .    a detailed discussion of the lw05 models is given in lw05 , and the correction of these models for nsars is discussed in mendel ( 2007 ) .",
    "similarly , details of the tmk04 models are given in tmk04 and thomas ( 2003 ) .",
    "for our purposes , the lw05 have been corrected for nsars using the fractional sensitivities of h02 , and have also been interpolated in age , metallicity and [ e / fe ] to give finer grids spacings .",
    "the tmk04 ssps are used as published , but have also been interpolated in age , metallicity and [ e / fe ] .",

    "we note that these ngc  5128 data show a significant spread in cn@xmath34 when compared to the milky way gcs .          to estimate the ssp model parameters which best describe these data , we employed the robust multi - index @xmath61 fitting approach detailed in proctor ( 2004 ) .",
    "this method has been used with success to estimate ages , metallicities and abundance ratios for both galaxies and extragalactic gcs , giving consistent results with single index - index determinations , but is more robust when confronted with problems such as varying s / n and background emission ( e.g. , proctor 2004 ; pierce 2006 ) .",

    "an outstanding , unsolved problem is how to deal with unresolved hot stellar populations ( horizontal branch stars , blue stragglers etc . ) in the integrated spectra of gcs , which can mimic the effect of young stellar populations ( e.g. , burstein 1984 ) .",
    "this is possibly the origin of the `` young '' ssp ages for the most metal - rich milky way gcs in this study , and remains a key uncertainty in attempts to age - date gcs from integrated spectra ( e.g. , beasley 2002a ; puzia 2005 ; cenarro 2007 ) .",
    "hot stars in old stellar populations can and are , of course , included in ssps , but in general follow recipes based on milky way gcs ( e.g. , vazdekis 1999 ; maraston 2000 ; lee 2000 ) .",
    "the behaviour of non - canonical populations can not be modelled _ a priori _ and therefore must be estimated by observation .",
    "wider wavelength ranges beyond the optical are urgently required to address this problem . in particular , we look forward to the use of _ galex _ in constraining the near and far uv flux and therefore the hot star populations in unresolved stellar systems . this uncertainty in how to deal with non - canonical populations , and the differences in the age predictions of the tmk04 and lw05 models at high metallicity ( see section [ ssps ] and mendel ( 2007 ) ) ,",
    "must be born in mind in the following discussion of gc ages .",
    "one of the main results of this study is that the spectroscopic mdf of the ngc 5128 gcs is clearly bimodal , if not multimodal .",
    "the colour distribution of this gc system also appears bimodal ( e.g. harris 2004 ) , as do the colour distributions of gc systems for most massive galaxies ( e.g. , larsen 2001 ; harris 2004 ; strader 2004 ; peng 2006 ) .",
    "yoon ( 2006 ) have suggested that such bimodal colour distributions might simply be a result of a non - linear colour - metallicity relation , i.e. , an intrinsically unimodal metallicity distribution can appear bimodal in broadband colours .",
    "however , our results indicate otherwise .",
    "the mdfs of extragalactic gcs in massive galaxies _ are _ bimodal , and this needs to be accounted for by any models of gc system ( and massive galaxy ) formation .",
    "our results for ngc 5128 are in agreement with the results from ir photometry of m87 gcs ( kundu & zepf 2007 ) and with the cohen ( 2003 ) spectroscopy of m49 gcs as shown by strader ( 2007 ) .",
    "we are again faced with the problem that the gc systems of massive galaxies are bimodal in colour / metallicity . from a chemical evolution point of view , a unimodal distribution is easier to understand than a bimodal one ( e.g. , harris & harris 2002 ; beasley 2003 ; bekki 2003 ; vandalfsen & harris 2004 ; pipino 2007 )",
    ". this would be particularly true if the mdfs of the gcs and field stars were to resemble each other , since the same star formation recipe may reasonably be expected to be applicable to both . however , as shown in section  [ analysis ] , the gc and stellar mdfs are quite different .",
    "the most metal - rich ends of the distributions do show a strong resemblance ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdf ] ) , but the radial gradient of the field stars in ngc 5128 suggests that the innermost stars in this galaxy are more metal - rich than the vast majority of the gcs found in this survey ( harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , any resemblance between the mdfs quickly disappears with decreasing metallicity .",
    "the inference is that either the ratio of gc formation to field star formation efficiency increases with decreasing metallicity , or that the dynamical destruction efficiency of gcs increases with increasing metallicity ( or some combination of the two ) .",
    "this applies equally whether the gcs and field stars are formed _ in situ _",
    "( e.g. , forbes 1997 ) or come from elsewhere ( e.g. , ct , marzke & west 1998 ; beasley 2002b ) . understanding these differences , and indeed _ how",
    "exactly one should compare the field stars to the gcs ( e.g. , at what radius ) remains an important aspect in understanding the galaxy  gc connection .",
    "our stellar population analysis suggests that there may be a mixture of gc ages in the ngc 5128 system .",
    "we find that some 1015% ( ssp model",
    "dependent ) of the sample may have intermediate ages ( @xmath6 gy ) .",
    "at least one cluster is younger and more metal - poor than the intermediate - age candidates ( hghh - g279 ; @xmath8 gy , [ z / h]@xmath84 ) , with peng ( 2002 ) finding an even younger cluster ( @xmath85 1 gy ) in a blue tidal stream in the halo of ngc 5128 . a @xmath86 fraction of intermediate - age clusters is substantially lower than the @xmath87 estimate claimed by pff04 , bringing ngc 5128 more into line with the small contribution of intermediate - age populations found in other nearby ellipticals ( strader 2005 ) .",
    "the difference between the present study and that of pff04 can be understood largely in terms of the small sample size of the pff04 study , which with its brighter magnitude cut harboured an overrepresentative number of young clusters .",
    "beasley ( 2003 ) specifically modelled the star formation histories of ngc 5128like gc systems ( i.e. , systems of similar mass , morphology and environmental density ) with the semianalytical galaxy formation model of cole ( 2000 ) .",
    "of the eight model systems presented in beasley ( 2003 ) , the relative fractions of metal - rich gcs formed within the past 8 gy ( @xmath74 ) range from @xmath88 , with a median value of 20% .",
    "if we define the fraction of young / old clusters in ngc 5128 as only those gcs in the metal - rich peak ( [ z / h]@xmath11 ) , which one might expect are the gcs formed in later star formation episodes , we obtain a young cluster fraction of @xmath89 , in good agreement with the model predictions .",
    "our results are also broadly consistent with the `` gc formation history '' derived by kaviraj ( 2005 ) who , from the @xmath90 colours of 210 ngc 5128 gcs , estimated that some @xmath91 of gc mass was created 24 gy ago .     bulge light .",
    "[ fig : amr ] , width=302 ]    beasley ( 2003 ) also presented a series of age ",
    "metallicity relations for gc systems formed using the semianalytic model .",
    "these relations are compared to the ages and metallicities of the gcs in our sample ( lw05 models ) in figure  [ fig : amr ] . at old ages , there is little discriminating power in the ssp models , and in the semianalytic the age of the metal - poor gcs is effectively fixed at @xmath92 the `` truncation redshift '' ( corresponding to 12.3 gy look - back time for the cosmology adopted in beasley 2003 ) . for the metal - rich gcs ,",
    "the model predicts a clear age - metallicity for the gcs ( in fact , such a relation is a generic prediction of semi - analytic models ) .",
    "the model age - metallicity relation reproduces the observations in the broadest sense ( in the sense that there do appear to be young and metal - rich gcs in ngc 5128 ) .",
    "however , two obvious problems remain .",
    "firstly , it is not clear whether the ngc 5128 sample shows a _ relation _ as such , but rather a large population of old gcs and a smaller population of younger gcs with similar ages and metallicities .",
    "indeed , the spread in ages in the younger gcs is consistent with our observational errors ( although , the metallicities do show a large intrinsic spread ) .",
    "secondly , it is clear that the model age - metallicity relation is too metal - rich for the observations .",
    "a reduction in the effective yield of the model ( see beasley 2003 ) would bring closer agreement with the observations , but this would result in the production of host galaxies which are too metal - poor for their luminosities , affecting the zeropoint of the colour - magnitude relation .    and here lies a generic problem with merger models which attempt to unify gc formation with the formation of the bulk of the host galaxy stars ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ; beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; bekki et al . 2002 ) : in a model where metal - rich gcs and the galaxy stars are formed simultaneously through the same mechanism in mergers , the most metal - rich gcs should be as metal - rich as the most metal - rich galaxy stars . comparison between the gc mdf and the 8 kpc stellar mdf ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdf ] ) suggests that this does not seem to be the case since there is a clear excess of solar and super - solar metallicity stars with respect to gcs . for this `` simple '' merger model to remain tenable , gc",
    "formation and star formation must be decoupled during the merger process such that the stars can enrich to significantly higher levels than the gcs .",
    "otherwise , we are faced with the possibility that the mechanism which produces very metal - rich stars in galaxies is not that which produces metal - rich gcs .",
