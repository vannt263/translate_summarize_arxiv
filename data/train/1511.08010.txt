    "particular details of how to implement it fall beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "this choice of the density dependent field is particularly attractive as it has one specific limit in which the topological properties of the system can be easily understood .",

    "indeed , no difference is seen between the shape of the single - particle spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ landau ] ) , fig .",

    ", we find the energy spectrum to be split into three gapped manifolds , each of them consisting of three states . in the many - body system ,",
    "a gapless high - energy manifold lies above the third band .",
    "deviations from this structure appear when @xmath3 is decreased , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_twbc](b  e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_s ] .",
    "the dynamical mechanism is the following .",
    "as @xmath3 is decreased , the number of holon - doublon excitations increases , the single - particle picture described above is no - longer valid .",
    "first , for @xmath35 , the gap between the third band and the high - energy manifold closes , as the first doublon - holon excitations have the same energy as the third single particle state .",
    "subsequently , at @xmath36 , also the gap to the second band is closed .",
    "these gap closings indicate phase transitions in excited states . at @xmath37 ,",
    "also the gap to the lowest band is closed .",
    "thus , up to @xmath37 the ground state manifold has a topological structure similar to the case of a single particle subjected to an external magnetic field of @xmath38 .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is a bit higher than the value at which we found a gappless phase for the filling one case described below .",
    "thus , the main picture of a single particle on top of a mott insulating background is consistent .",
    "remarkably , further lowering the value of the interaction another threefold - degenerate gapped manifold appears for @xmath39 . only for @xmath40",
    "the system enters in a gapless phase .",
    "we note that for @xmath39 the gap is small , of the order of 10% of the involved energy scales .",
    "it is a merit of the twisted boundary conditions that the three lowest states are clearly identified as an adiabatically connected manifold , separated from the other levels by a gap .",
    "in fact , if we look at the system for a fixed value of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , or alternatively for open boundary conditions , the gap can not be distinguished from the energy splitting between states in the degenerate manifold . the evolution of the gap between the ground state manifold and the next excited state for the all values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is given in fig .  [",
    "fig : gap ] .",
    "the gap above a manifold as function of @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_s ] . for @xmath41",
    "the gap closes at @xmath42 .",
    "the next closing , for @xmath37 appears close to @xmath43 .",
    "this could diminish the prospects for an experimental detection of this phase in the plane geometry , but since an experiment would realize a much bigger system , there is hope that finite - size degeneracy splitting would be sufficiently small to identify the finite gap .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_e ] , we contrast our findings to the scenario with static magnetic field . as expected , at large @xmath3 the differences between fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_s ] and  [ fig : mingapband_e ] are minor .",
    "also for a static magnetic field , increasing @xmath3 subsequently closes the gaps above the third and the second band .",
    "however , the gap above the ground state remains finite up to @xmath44 and , for @xmath45 , it vanishes .      at precisely filling one , for 9 particles on 9 lattice sites ,",
    "see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n89 ] , we find a unique gapped ground state for @xmath46 , which is connected to the mott insulator as an exact solution for @xmath47 .",
    "this phase is trivial in the sense that it corresponds to a vacuum , where deviations from integer filling exist only as fluctuations . for @xmath48",
    ", we find a gapless phase , that is , despite the presence of the dynamical gauge field , no topological structure protected by an energy gap emerges in this scenario .",
    "the first and second excited bands are three- and six - fold degenerate , respectively .",
    "they are topologically non - trivial and their chern numbers are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this excited bands coincide , in degeneracy and topology , with the lowest band of the non - interacting systems with one and two particles in the same lattice , as they are explained in section  [ sec : top ] .",
    "a. these excited bands can be understood as one and two particle - hole excitations on the top of the mott insulator , when the particle feels an effective static magnetic field and the hole do not .",
    "we also study the tunnelling of a single hole .",
    "that is , in our @xmath33 lattice we consider @xmath51 bosons .",
    "the gap structure we find is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n89 ]  b ) .",
    "as expected , we find that increasing the interaction up to @xmath52 , a gap opens between the nine - fold degenerate manifold , understood as one hole moving in the mott - insulating background , and the rest of the states . the ground state manifold is found to have a trivial topological order .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the energy gaps appearing for the case of one excess particle , the filling one , and the one hole case .",
    "the only case in which we have found non - trivial topological structures is for the case of one excess particle . in the following",
    "we present the chern number obtained compared to the case of an external field of flux @xmath5 .",
    "first , we calculate the chern numbers of the single - particle system described by @xmath53 , that is , of the bands shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_twbc ] a ) .",
    "we obtain the values @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the calculation can either be done via fourier transformation , taking the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be components of the wave vector  @xcite , or with twisted boundary conditions , taking the twist angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 as parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the discretization of parameter space is arbitrary , but we observe quick convergence of the chern numbers to fixed numbers upon refining the discretization .",
    "the non - interacting case can be related to the single particle case although some caution should be exercised .",
    "for instance , direct computation of the chern number of the ground state manifold for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 particles in the @xmath33 lattice we consider gives @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "these can be obtained by noting that due to the bosonic symmetry , we have a combinatorial factor stemming from the number of times the fock basis covers the threefold degenerate band .",
    "this can be evaluated giving , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the single particle chern number of the gs manifold , @xmath64 .      to calculate the chern numbers of many - body states , we exclusively resort to the twisted boundary conditions .",
    "for the three gapped manifolds appearing at @xmath65 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_s ] , we obtain the same chern numbers as for the single particle bands : @xmath54 .",
    "these numbers remain constant for each manifold until the closing of the corresponding gap . upon closing the gap , the second and",
    "the third bands simply merge with the energy continuum , for which no chern number can be computed .",
    "this is easily understood as for large enough interactions the many - body ground state is well described as consisting on a mott - insulating background plus one particle .",
    "the lower band is given by the energy of the extra particle in the presence of an external field with flux @xmath66 .",
    "the closing of the bands in the higher part of the spectrum comes from the first particle - hole excitations which eventually degenerate with excitations of the excess particle .",
    "note that even though this simple picture provides a compelling explanation it is quite remarkable that albeit the many - body state changes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] , as @xmath3 is decreased , the topology of the band does not change for a broad range of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast with the above , the gap closing of the ground state at @xmath67 separates two gapped regions , see in particular the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_s ] .",
    "interestingly , we find that upon closing the band gap , the ground state chern number changes its sign from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "this demonstrates that a topological phase transition between two distinct , but topologically non - trivial phases is taking place .",
    "the second gap closing , at @xmath70 , merges the ground state manifold with the energy continuum which , in this sense , is a transition to a topologically trivial ( gapless ) phase .      finally , we note also that the three gapped manifolds found for a system with static magnetic field , with @xmath71 , are characterized by the same chern numbers @xmath54 , without any transitions to distinct gapped phases . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapband_e ] , the arguments exposed above also apply to this case and the picture of a single particle on top of a mott - insulator is perfectly valid .",
    "the only relevant difference appears for low interaction energies . in this case",
    ", the mott insulating phase seems to survive down to lower values of the interaction as compared to the density dependent case .",
    "thus , density dependence phases favor the existence of superfluid regimes at larger interactions than in the static case .",
    "also we find no trace of the first excitation being a topological phase with @xmath72 in the region @xmath73 .",
    "in this case the limit @xmath74 can be understood from the single - particle calculation : the ground states for @xmath75 bosons are just arbitrary distributions on the @xmath76 states belonging to the lowest energy band in a lattice with @xmath77 sites at magnetic flux @xmath78 . this leads to a macroscopic ground state degeneracy ( of 63 states in our case with @xmath34 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) , for which no meaningful chern number can be defined .",
    "recent `` chern number '' measurements in non - interacting bosonic quantum gases  @xcite consider the hall drift for unique but gapless many - body states , and define as a `` chern number '' the average over different states .",
    "in order to get a picture of the phase diagram , we have adapted the mean - field calculation of ref .",
