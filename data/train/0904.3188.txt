    "the second law of thermodynamics , explicitly in the form of kelvin - planck postulate , puts a fundamental limit to the way in which usable work can be extracted from heat reservoirs , and to the maximum amount of work extractable ( carnot s principle ) .",
    "in particular , kelvin - planck postulate states that it is not possible to _ cyclically _ extract work from a _ single _ heat reservoir .",
    "clausius postulate of the second law , which is notoriously equivalent to the kelvin - planck one , makes the impossibility more striking and understandable : heat can not spontaneously flow from sources at absolute temperature @xmath1 to sources at absolute temperature @xmath2 when @xmath3 .",
    "although in the macroscopic physical world the second law seems authoritatively to make the difference between what is allowed and what is forbidden ( to date , no experimental violation of the second law has been claimed ) , in the microscopic realm it seems to be continuously violated : let us take into account the brownian motion or every fluctuation phenomena , for example .    about brownian motion ,",

    "maxwell s demon _ is actually an idealized version of fluctuations rectification .",
    "the main difficulties which seem to afflict all these past approaches ( sentient and non - sentient ) are that every macroscopic / microscopic rectifier device seems either to suffer fluctuations itself , which neutralize every usable net effect , or its functioning seems to increase the total entropy of the system ( at least of the same amount of the alleged reduction ) mainly because of energy dissipation and/or entropy cost in the acquisition of information needed to run the device ( for sentient devices ) .    for an interesting historical account of second law classical challenges ( starting from maxwell , and passing through smoluchowski , szilard , brillouin , till landauer ) and their attempted resolutions , see earman and norton  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , over the last 10 - 15 years an unparalleled number of challenges has been proposed against the status of the second law of thermodynamics . during this period",
    ", more than 50 papers have appeared in the refereed scientific literature ( see , for example , references  @xcite ) , together with a monograph entirely devoted to this subject  @xcite . moreover , during the same period of time two international conferences on the limit of the second law were also held  @xcite .    the general class of recent challenges  @xcite spans from plasma  @xcite , chemical  @xcite , gravitational  @xcite and solid - state  @xcite . currently , all these approaches appear immune to standard second law defenses ( for a compendium of classical defenses , see  @xcite again ) and several of them account laboratory corroboration of their underlying physical processes .",
    "the present paper aims to describe another approach to microscopic rectification that poses interesting theoretical questions along the aforementioned recent line of research : we are referring to an equivalent of the photo - electric effect with materials emitting electrons at room temperature .",
    "if we succeed in collecting all the electrons emitted by these materials in consequence of the absorption of black - body radiation from the uniformly heated environment , then we would be able to create a macroscopic voltage out of a single heat reservoir .",
    "although this voltage appears to be _ prima facie _ an innocuous consequence of some well established physical laws , the whole process of thermo - charging presents quite interesting and paradoxical features which , analyzed with the tools of classical thermodynamics , appear to violate the second law and seem to provide support to the recent results presented in the above cited literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe our thermo - charged capacitor , which bears interesting similarities with some recent challenges presented in  @xcite , and provide a thorough mathematical analysis of its functioning . in the last section we discuss the paradoxical features of the physical process and show quantitatively why it seems to be at odds with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] a sketched section of our vacuum spherical capacitor is shown .",
    "the outer sphere has radius @xmath4 and it is made of ( conductive ) material with high work function ( @xmath5ev ) .",
    "high work function means relatively low thermionic emission .",
    "the inner sphere , instead , has radius @xmath6 and it is made of a thermionic ( conductive ) material with relatively low work function ( @xmath7ev ) .",
    "it should be clear that in such case the two thermionic fluxes are different , being the latter greater than the former and the former negligible .",
    "actually , this is true only at the beginning of the thermo - charging process ; as a matter of fact , to reach our goal it suffices to concentrate on the initial phase of the process .",

    "all the electrons emitted by the inner sphere , due to thermionic emission at room temperature , is collected by the outer ( very low emitting ) sphere creating a macroscopic difference of potential @xmath13 .",
    "such process lasts until @xmath13 is too high to be overcome by the kinetic energy @xmath14 of the main fraction of emitted electrons ( namely , when @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the charge of electron ) .",
    "being the work function of the outer sphere greater than that of the inner one , @xmath17 , the reverse process , namely the electronic flux from the outer sphere to the inner one , may be neglected without sensibly modifying our results . as said before , this is true only at the beginning of the charging process . at equilibrium ,",
    "both fluxes are equal to that of the outer sphere and they balance each other exactly .",
    "anyhow , our analysis concerns exclusively the initial phase of the process and the validity of our results remains unaffected by the establishment of the final equilibrium",
    ".    it could be interesting to provide an estimate of the value of @xmath13 obtainable and an estimate of the time needed to reach such value , given the physical characteristics of the capacitor and the quantum efficiency curve @xmath18 of thermionic material of the inner sphere .",
    "the capacitor is placed in a heat bath at room temperature ( environment ) and it is subject to black - body radiation .",
    "both spheres , at thermal equilibrium , emit and absorb an equal amount of radiation ( kirchhoff s law of thermal radiation ) , thus the amount of radiation absorbed by the inner sphere is the same as that emitted by that sphere according to the black - body radiation formula ( planck equation ) .",
    "given the room temperature @xmath19 , planck equation provides us with the number distribution of photons absorbed as a function of their frequency .    according to the law of thermionic emission ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath14 of the emitted electron is given by the following equation ,    @xmath20    where @xmath11 is the energy of the photon with frequency @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the planck constant ) and @xmath23 is the work function of the material .",
    "thus , only the tail of the planck distribution of the absorbed photons , with frequency @xmath24 , can contribute to the thermionic emission .",
    "the voltage @xmath13 reachable with frequency @xmath25 is given by the following formula ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the inter - spheres potential energy , and thus ,    @xmath28    the total number of photons per unit time @xmath29 with energy greater than or equal to @xmath30 , emitted and absorbed in thermal equilibrium by the inner sphere , is given by the planck equation ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the inner sphere surface area , @xmath33 is the speed of light , @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath19 the room temperature .",
    "if @xmath18 is the quantum efficiency ( or quantum yield ) curve of thermionic material of the inner sphere , then the number of electrons per unit time @xmath35 thermionically emitted by the inner sphere towards the outer sphere with kinetic energy greater than or equal to @xmath36 , is given by ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the surface area of the inner sphere .",
    "for a vacuum spherical capacitor , the voltage @xmath13 between the spheres and the charge @xmath39 on each sphere are linked by the following equation ,    @xmath40    now , we derive the differential equation which governs the process of thermo - charging . in the interval of time @xmath41 the charge collected by the outer sphere is given by ,    @xmath42    where we make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) for @xmath25 and @xmath43 is the voltage at time @xmath44 .",
    "thus , through the differential form of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we have ,    @xmath45    or    @xmath46    since our aim is to maximize the production of voltage @xmath13 , we have to choose @xmath6 and @xmath4 such that they maximize the geometrical factor @xmath47 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the maximum is reached when @xmath48 .",
    "so we have ,    @xmath49    unfortunately , provided that an analytical approximation of a real quantum efficiency curve @xmath18 exists , the previous differential equation appears to have no general , simple analytical solution .    however , a close look at the planckian integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) suggests to us the asymptotic behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "even if we do not know _ a priori _ how @xmath18 is , we know it to be a bounded function of frequency , with values between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; usually , the higher is @xmath21 , the closer to @xmath51 is @xmath18 .",
    "thus , independently of @xmath18 , a slight increase of @xmath43 makes the value of the planckian integral to be smaller and smaller very fast .",
    "heuristically , this suggests that @xmath43 should tend quite rapidly to an ` asymptotic ' value ( since @xmath52 tends to @xmath50 ) .",
    "in the rest of this section we provide a numerical solution of the above differential equation for the practical case of inner sphere made of ag  o  cs  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "to do that we need to adopt an approximation , however : the approximation consists in the adoption of a constant value for @xmath53 , a sort of suitable mean value @xmath54 .",
    "the differential equation  ( [ eq10 ] ) thus becomes ,    @xmath55    a straightforward variable substitution in the integral of eq .",

    "( [ eq12 ] ) , adopting the following nominal values for @xmath23 , @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath54 : @xmath62ev , @xmath57 m , @xmath58k , and @xmath59 . in order to make a conservative choice for the value of @xmath54 we note that only black - body radiation with frequency greater than @xmath63 can contribute to thermionic emission .",
    "this means that for the ag ",
    "o  cs photo - cathode only radiation with wavelength smaller than @xmath64 nm contributes to the emission . according to fig .",
    "1 in bates  @xcite , the quantum yield of ag  o  cs for wavelengths smaller than @xmath65 ( and thus , for frequency greater than @xmath66 ) is always greater than @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig2 ] the numerical solution of the above test it is shown . in plot ( a )",
    "we could easily see how only after 60 seconds the voltage of the capacitor exceeds the value of @xmath60volts .",
    "indeed , this is a macroscopic voltage . instead ,",
    "plot ( b ) tells us that the voltage of the capacitor requires some hours to approach @xmath61volts .",
    "even in the more pessimistic scenario where @xmath68 we see that a macroscopic voltage should arise quite rapidly between the plates , see fig .",
    "at first sight , the charging process is a quite straightforward physical mechanism and it appears almost unproblematic . however , one feature of the thermo - charging should catch our attention . during the charging of the device the inner thermionic sphere substantially absorbs heat from the environment and releases this energy to the thermionic electrons .",
    "such electrons fly to the outer sphere and impinge on it with non zero velocity ( since a non zero fraction of them gathers their kinetic energy from the high energetic tail of the planck distribution of black - body radiation ) .",
    "when they impinge on the outer sphere , they release their kinetic energy substantially heating the outer sphere .",
    "thus , we are facing a spontaneous process involving an isolated system at uniform temperature ( capacitor + environment ) , in which a part of the system ( the inner sphere of the capacitor ) absorbs heat at temperature @xmath19 and transfers a fraction of this heat to the other part of the system ( the outer sphere ) at the same temperature .",
    "this seems to macroscopically violate the second law of thermodynamics in the clausius formulation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if @xmath71 is the energy absorbed by the inner sphere from the environment , @xmath72 is the energy stored in the electric field between the spheres ( @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the capacitance of the spherical capacitor ) , and @xmath75 is the energy transferred through the flying electrons to the outer sphere as heat ( according to the first law of thermodynamics @xmath76 , thus @xmath77 ) , then the clausius entropy variation of the whole system , as rough estimate , amounts to :    @xmath78    in order to make the above result more striking , let us consider the following analogue in classical thermodynamics / mechanics : a boulder of mass @xmath79 rests at the bottom of a valley , below a hill of height @xmath22 , all the system at constant temperature @xmath19 .",
    "suddenly , the boulder spontaneously absorbs an amount @xmath80 of heat ( energy ) from the environment and spontaneously starts to climb the hill at decreasing velocity ( since the initial kinetic energy is being transformed into gravitational potential energy ) .",
    "near the top of the hill the boulder hits a sort of wall and then stops .",
    "the friction experienced during the hit against the wall lets the boulder release to the environment an amount @xmath81 of heat , obviously smaller than @xmath80 . according to the first law of thermodynamics we have : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the gravitational potential energy variation of the boulder from the valley to the top of the hill .",
    "now , the total clausius entropy variation is :    @xmath84    the behavior of the boulder - environment system is practically the same as that of our electrons - environment system , and it is undoubtedly puzzling from the point of view of the second law of thermodynamics .    since the thermo - charging process is a spontaneous process , the variation of the gibbs free energy of the system @xmath85 should be negative .",
    "the enthalpy variation for constant pressure systems is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the system internal energy variation and @xmath88 is the work produced .",
    "@xmath89 is equal to @xmath50 since , from the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath90 ( after all , we are dealing with an isolated system -capacitor plus environment- , then the total @xmath91 is equal to zero ) , and thus we have @xmath92",
    ". this is another way to see the paradoxical behavior of our system .",
    "one possible objection could be that some other physical changes take place in the system during the process that may cancel out the apparent entropy decrease .",
    "surely , during the charging process an electric field , and thus an electric potential , is created inside the capacitor where none existed before .",
    "thus , one could attribute to the creation of the electric field an entropy increase greater than the entropy decrease due to the cooling and warming of the spheres .    a problem with this explanation could follows directly from the logic of the entropy variation analysis done for the ideal carnot engine : the electric field represents a sort of work produced and stored in potential form by our capacitor , as could happen with a standard mechanical carnot engine whose work is stored in a lifted weight .",
    "hence , we are not able to see why for classical carnot engine ( and for classical thermodynamics ) the work @xmath93 is not taken into account in the evaluation of the total entropy variation ( unless it is transformed into heat , but it is not the case here ) , while for our thermo - charged capacitor the macroscopic stored energy ( work ) @xmath72 should be taken into account for the evaluation of the total @xmath94 . in order to save the validity of the second law of thermodynamics we need to find other sources of positive entropy during the charging process .    the above results do not seem to depend on the particular value of the work function of the outer sphere , provided that @xmath95ev .",
    "one may suppose that when the electrons fly into the outer sphere with higher work function , they diminish their potential energy and release a kinetic energy greater than that they had before impinging on the sphere , thus producing @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , and eventually giving @xmath97 .",
    "but , what about the conservation of energy ? as a matter of fact ,",
    "if at some point of the charging process we try to neutralize both spheres putting them into contact at the same time with two distinct huge ( infinite ) chunks of neutral ( conductive ) materials , respectively of the same composition of the two spheres ( in order to avoid problems with junction potentials ) and at the same temperature @xmath19 , then this process will release further energy through the joule effect of the discharge ( as a matter of fact , each sphere disperses its charge into the huge chunk of neutral material ) .",
    "this energy is equal to @xmath72 , the energy of the thermo - generated electric field .",
    "the energy balance @xmath98 of the entire process , thermo - charging and neutralization , thus gives : the total subtracted energy amounts to @xmath71 , the released energy amounts to @xmath99 , but according to the above attempted solution of the entropy paradox @xmath96 , and thus @xmath100 , namely we would have a spontaneous energy production inside an isolated system .",
    "so , the above argument can not be an acceptable explanation of the paradox .",
    "this last incongruity sounds familiar , since it is not the first time that the second law is put against to the first law in scientific literature , see  @xcite , p.  473 .",
    "moreover , sommerfeld in 1952  @xcite , trying to show how a _ quasi - static _ process does not always mean a _ reversible _ one , described the slow discharge of a charged capacitor through a very large resistance submersed in a heat reservoir : the discharge will take place by an arbitrarily small current , and negligible disturbance of electrostatic equilibrium , thus , such a process is _ quasi - static _ , but not _",
    "reversible_. in fact , the reverse process , he said , is not allowed by the second law  @xcite .    to the author knowledge , our result represents an easily understandable and not so trivially refutable challenge to the clausius formulation of the second law ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) . in its current incarnation , however , it is not completely clear how this alleged challenge could be made exploitable , namely how our capacitor could be transformed into a device able to _ cyclically _ produce usable net work out of a single heat bath ( e.g. challenging the kelvin - planck formulation of the second law ) .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "if our result will resist the deep scrutiny of the scientific community in the years to come , then we are reasonably confident that , for our approach , an efficient path from `` clausius violation '' to the `` kelvin - planck violation '' of the second law can be found , being the two formulation notoriously equivalent .",
