    "among various objectives of the recently finished lep experiments an important place was devoted to searching for signals of new physics beyond the energy scale of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "reports on these results are adduced partly in the literature @xcite . in the present note",
    "we are going to discuss the problem of searching for the heavy @xmath0 gauge boson @xcite .",
    "this particle is a necessary element of the different models extending the sm .",
    "low limits on its mass following from the analysis of variety of popular models ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , l ",
    "r models @xcite and the sequential standard model ( ssm ) @xcite ) are found to be in the energy intervals 5002000 gev @xcite ( see table [ t1 ] which reproduces table 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as it is seen , the values of @xmath6 ( as well as the parameters of interactions with the sm particles ) are strongly model dependent .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to find some model independent signals of this particle . to elaborate",
    "that general principles of field theory must be taken into consideration giving a possibility to relate the parameters of different scattering processes .",
    "then , one is able to introduce variables , convenient for the model independent search for @xmath0 ( or other heavy states ) .",
    "these ideas were used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to introduce the model - independent sign definite variables for @xmath0 detection in scattering processes with @xmath7 gev .    as it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , some parameters of new heavy fields can be related by using the requirement of renormalizability of the underlying model remaining in other respects unspecified .",
    "the relations between the parameters of new physics due to the renormalizability were called the renormalization group ( rg ) relations . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rg relations for the low - energy @xmath0 couplings to the sm fields have been derived .",
    "they predict two possible types of @xmath0 particles , namely , the chiral and the abelian @xmath0 ones .",
    "each type is described by a few couplings to the sm fields .",
    "therefore , taking into account the rg correlations between the @xmath0 couplings , one is able to introduce observables which uniquely pick up the @xmath0 virtual state @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we discuss these observables and the constraints on possible @xmath0 signals following from the analysis of the lep data .",
    "to consider the @xmath0 interactions with light particles one must specify the model describing physics at low energies . for instance , the minimal sm with the one scalar doublet can be chosen . however , due to the lack of information about scalar fields , models with an extended set of light scalar particles can be also considered .",
    "below we choose the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite as the low - energy theory ( notice , the minimal sm is the particular case of the thdm ) .    to derive the rg relations one has to introduce the parametrization of @xmath0 couplings to the sm fields .",
    "since we are going to account of the @xmath0 effects in the low - energy @xmath8 processes in lower order in @xmath9 , the linear in @xmath0 interactions with the sm fields are of interest , only .",
    "the renormalizability of the underlying theory and the decoupling theorem @xcite guarantee the dominance of renormalizable @xmath0 interactions at low energies .",
    "the interactions of the non - renormalizable types , generated at high energies due to radiation corrections , are suppressed by the inverse heavy mass .",
    "the sm gauge group @xmath10 is considered as a subgroup of the underlying theory group .",
    "so , the mixing interactions of the types @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... are absent at the tree level .",
    "such conditions are usually used in the literature @xcite and lead to the following parametrization of the linear in @xmath0 low - energy vertices : @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 are the scalar doublets , @xmath16 is the charge corresponding to the @xmath0 gauge group , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electroweak covariant derivatives , @xmath19 denotes the massive @xmath0 field before the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , and the summation over the all sm left - handed fermion doublets , @xmath20 , and the right - handed singlets , @xmath21 , is understood .",
    "diagonal @xmath22 matrices @xmath23 , @xmath24 and numbers @xmath25 are unknown @xmath0 generators characterizing the model beyond the sm .    the one - loop rg relations for the above introduced @xmath0 vertices ( [ 1 ] ) have been obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "as it was shown , two different types of the @xmath0 generators are compatible with the renormalizability of the underlying theory .",
    "the first type , called the chiral @xmath0 , describes the @xmath0 boson which couples to the sm doublets , only .",
    "the corresponding generators have the zero traces : @xmath26 the second type is the abelian @xmath0 boson : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the third component of the fermion weak isospin . the relations ( [ abelian ] )",
    "ensure , in particular , the invariance of the yukawa terms with respect to the effective low - energy @xmath29 subgroup corresponding to the @xmath0 boson . as it follows from the relations , the couplings of the abelian @xmath0 to the axial - vector fermion currents have the universal absolute value proportional to the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublets .",
    "the derived relations ( [ chiral])([abelian ] ) are independent of a specific model beyond the sm predicting the @xmath0 boson .",
    "they hold in the thdm as well as in the minimal sm .",
    "as it is seen from relations ( [ chiral])([abelian ] ) , only one parameter for each sm doublet remains arbitrary .",
    "the rest parameters are expressed through them .",
    "a few number of independent @xmath0 couplings gives the possibility to introduce the observables convenient for detecting uniquely the @xmath0 signals in experiments @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we analyze the obtained at lep data taking into account the rg relations ( [ abelian ] ) in order to constrain possible signals of the abelian @xmath0 boson .",
    "consider the leptonic processes @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) with the neutral vector boson exchange ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we assume the non - polarized initial- and final - state fermions . at lep energies",
    "@xmath33 gev the fermions can be treated as massless particles , @xmath34 . in this approximation",
    "the left - handed and the right - handed fermions can be substituted by the helicity states , which we mark as @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the incoming electron and the outgoing fermion , respectively ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the differential cross section of the process @xmath38 deviates from its sm value by a quantity of order @xmath9 : @xmath39 ,   \\nonumber\\\\   { \\cal a}_{\\rm sm}&=&{\\cal a}_a + { \\cal a}_z(\\theta_0 = 0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the angle between the momentum of the incoming electron and the momentum of the outgoing lepton , @xmath41 is the born amplitude of the process , and @xmath42 is the @xmath43@xmath0 mixing angle .",
    "the leading contribution comes from the interference between the @xmath0 exchange amplitude , @xmath44 , and the sm amplitude , @xmath45 , whereas the @xmath43@xmath0 mixing terms are suppressed by the additional small factor @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the deviation @xmath47 depends on the center - of - mass energy through the quantity @xmath46 , only .    to take into consideration the correlations ( [ abelian ] )",
    "let us introduce the observable @xmath48 defined as the difference of cross sections integrated in some ranges of the scattering angle @xmath40 , which will be specified below @xcite : @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 stands for the boundary angle , @xmath51 denotes the total cross section and @xmath52 is the forward - backward asymmetry of the process .",
    "the idea of introducing the @xmath50-dependent observable ( [ eq8 ] ) is to choose the value of the kinematic parameter @xmath50 in such a way that to pick up the characteristic features of the abelian @xmath0 signals . due to the correlations between the abelian @xmath0 couplings the quantity ( [ eq8 ] ) can be written as follows @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the @xmath0 couplings to the vector and the axial - vector lepton currents .",
    "functions @xmath56 are determined by the sm quantities and independent of the lepton generation .",
    "the leading contributions to the factors @xmath57 equal to zero .",
    "so , by choosing the boundary angle @xmath58 to be the solution to the equation @xmath59 , one can switch off three factors @xmath60 @xmath61 simultaneously .",
    "the function @xmath62 is the decreasing function of energy .",
    "this is shown in table [ t2 ] for the lep energies . in table [ t2 ]",
    "we also show the factors @xmath63 .",
    "as it is occurred , these factors contribute less than 2% .    by choosing @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the sign definite observable @xmath65 the quantity @xmath66 is negative and the same for the all types of the sm charged leptons .",
    "this is the model - independent signal of the abelian @xmath0 boson .",
    "thus , the variables @xmath66 select the @xmath0 boson signals in the processes @xmath67 .",
    "the measurements of the cross - sections and the forward - backward asymmetries have been combined for the full lep2 data set recently .",
    "the preliminary results are adduced in ref .",
    "let us analyze these data assuming a model independent search for signals of the abelian @xmath0 boson .    before doing that in the way outlined in the previous sections , we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite some other analysis of signals of physics beyond the sm in the processes @xmath8 was present .",
    "it is based on the introduction of the `` models '' describing different kinds of new four - fermion contact interactions . since one is able to successfully fit only one parameter of new physics ,",
    "eight models ( ll , rr , lr , rl , vv , aa , a0 , v0 ) assuming various helicity coupling between the initial state and final state currents are discussed .",
    "each model is described by only one non - zero coupling .",
    "for example , in the ll model the non - zero coupling of left - handed fermions is taken into account .",
    "the signal of a new heavy particle is fitted by considering the interference of the sm amplitude with the contact four - fermion term .",
    "whatever physics beyond the sm exists , it can manifest itself in some contact coupling mentioned .",
    "hence , it is possible to find a low limit on the masses of the states responsible for the interactions considered . in principle",
    ", a number of states may contribute into each of the models .",
    "therefore , the purpose of the fit described by these models is to find any signal of new physics .",
    "no specific types of new particles are considered in this analysis .",
    "the virtual states of heavy particles ( for instance , the abelian @xmath0 boson ) contribute to several contact interactions simultaneously , and the corresponding couplings can not be switched off separately .",
    "it is interesting to note the fits for the process @xmath68 in ref .",
    "several models mentioned demonstrate one standard deviation from the sm predictions for this process . in this regard ,",
    "we note the paper @xcite in which the mentioned models were investigated for the bhabha scattering @xmath69 .",
    "the deviations from the sm at the @xmath2level were found again , whereas the aa model shows the @xmath70level deviation . however , the question whether these deviations could be interpret as a signal of the abelian @xmath0 remains open .    the aim of our investigation is to pick up a model - independent signal of the virtual abelian @xmath0 boson , which uniquely selects this particle .",
    "the strategy is similar - to introduce the proper one - parametric variable ( [ eq7 ] ) on the discussed principles of renormalizability and the kinematic properties of scattering amplitudes . in our case",
    "we have a possibility to derive this observable by taking into consideration the renormalizability relations ( [ abelian ] ) and , therefore , the selection of the axial - vector currents is not the `` model '' . the observable @xmath71 accounts for all interactions of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "below , we will make an additional comparison of our method and that of in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , to search for the model - independent @xmath0 signals we will analyze the observable @xmath72 on the base of the full lep data set .",
    "it depends on one unknown @xmath0 parameter , @xmath73 , which describes the effective contact interaction between the axial - vector lepton currents . in what follows",
    "we will use the notation @xmath74 this normalization is admitted , in particular , in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is related to the observable @xmath66 by the factor which slightly depends on energy ( see table [ t2 ] ) : @xmath76      1 .",
    "all the lep data for the processes @xmath67 can be incorporated to obtain the limits on the observable .",
    "there is one parameter of new physics to be fitted .",
    "3 .   the data for the @xmath68 and @xmath77 scattering can be used to measure the same observable .",
    "the sign of the observable ( @xmath78 ) is the characteristic feature of the abelian @xmath0 signal .",
    "the lep data for the total cross - sections and the forward - backward asymmetries as well as the sm values of these quantities are shown in tables [ t3][t4 ] . from the set of the data we compute the observable @xmath66 and the corresponding error @xmath79 for each lep energy by means of the following relations @xmath80",

    "[ fig : zast ] .",
    "all the values of the observable are no more than one standard deviation from the sm value except for two points at 161 and 172 gev corresponding to the @xmath77 process . these points reflect the significant dispersion of the measurements for the scattering into @xmath81 pairs at @xmath82 gev . as it is also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : zast ] , the measurements for the center - of - mass energies @xmath83 gev have a higher level of precision",
    ".    we will choose three different sets of data to fit the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the first one is the complete set containing 20 points .",
    "the second set includes the data for the center - of - mass energies @xmath83 gev ( 12 measurements ) .",
    "the final set contains the data for the scattering into @xmath84 pairs ( 10 points ) .",
    "thus , there are 20 measurements @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) of the parameter @xmath75 with unequal precisions .",
    "we define the fitted value of @xmath75 , @xmath87 , as a linear combination of @xmath85 with factors which minimize the corresponding dispersion , @xmath88 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath89}^{-1 }   \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{(\\delta\\epsilon_i)^2},\\ ] ] @xmath90}^{-1}.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath91 gives the @xmath2-level interval for @xmath87 .",
    "note that the same value of @xmath87 can be derived as a result of the minimization of the likelihood function @xmath92 or the corresponding @xmath93-function .",
    "in this case the @xmath2-level interval ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) could be alternatively derived from the condition @xmath96=-0.5 $ ] .",
    "we use the log - likelihood method to determine a one sided lower limit on the scale @xmath97 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "it is derived by the integration of the likelihood function over the physically allowed region @xmath98 .",
    "the exact definition is @xmath99    in table [ t6 ] we show the fitted values of @xmath75 with their 68% confidence level uncertainties and the 95% confidence level lower limit on the scale @xmath97 . we also compute the total probability of the @xmath0 signal by integrating the likelihood function over the whole allowed range of @xmath75 ( @xmath98 ) .    as it is seen , all data sets lead to the comparable fitted values of @xmath87 with the nearly equal uncertainties .",
    "all the central values @xmath87 have the sign compatible with the @xmath0 signal . however , they are no more than one standard deviation from the sm value @xmath100 . thus ,",
    "though the central values witness to the @xmath0 existence , no @xmath0 signal is detected at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "this result reflects the lack of the accuracy of the input data . in this regard , fitting the observable directly from the final differential cross sections when they will be published may probably improve the accuracy .",
    "the more precise data corresponding to the scattering into @xmath101 pairs demonstrate the largest positive central value of @xmath75 .",
    "this value is nearly one standard deviation .",
    "taking into account the data for @xmath102 final states decreases the central value of the @xmath0 signal but does not affect essentially the uncertainty of the results .",
    "as our investigation showed , the characteristic signal of the abelian @xmath0 boson is concerned with the coupling of axial - vector currents . in this regard ,",
    "let us turn again to the helicity `` models '' of ref .",
    "@xcite and compare our results with the fitting for the aa case . as it follows from the present analysis",
    "this model is sensitive mostly to the signals of the abelian @xmath0 boson . of course , the parameter @xmath75 in ref .",
    "@xcite and in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is not the same quantity .",
    "as we already noted , in the aa model the @xmath0 couplings to the vector fermion currents are set to zero , therefore it is able to describe only some particular case of the abelian @xmath0 boson .",
    "moreover , in this model both the positive and the negative values of @xmath75 are considered , whereas in our approach only the positive ones are permissible . as the value of four - fermion contact coupling in the aa model is dependent on the lepton flavor ,",
    "the abelian @xmath0 induces the axial - vector coupling universal for all lepton types .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the fitted value of @xmath75 in the aa model for the @xmath101 final states ( @xmath103 ) as well as the value derived under the assumption of the lepton universality ( @xmath104 ) are similar to our results . since the parameters @xmath75 in ref .",
    "@xcite and in eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) have opposite signs by definition , the signs of the central values in the aa model agree with those of table [ t6 ] , whereas the uncertainties are of the same order .",
    "thus , as it follows from this analysis , the aa model is mainly responsible for signals of the abelian @xmath0 gauge boson although a lot of details concerning its interactions is not accounted for within this fit .",
    "the @xmath0 boson mass is related to the contact interaction scale @xmath97 by eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) . to convert the scale @xmath97 to the @xmath0 mass one have to assume the value of coupling @xmath16 .",
    "when the @xmath0 boson couples to the sm particles with a strength comparable with the electroweak forces @xmath105 , the central values of @xmath87 correspond to the masses of order 35 tev , whereas the lower limit on @xmath6 is about 1.41.7 tev .",
    "now let us compare these values with the constraints for different models in table [ t1 ] .",
    "as it is seen , the abelian @xmath0 can not be so light as the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 models predict . on the other hand , the lower limits derived in our paper are close to ones of the l ",
    "r models and the sequential standard model .",
    "thus , although the @xmath0 boson is not detected at lep , it can be light enough to be discovered at lhc .    9 lepewwg f@xmath106 subgroup ,",
