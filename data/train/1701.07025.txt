    "one of the mechanisms in the universe able to trigger bursts of star formation , as well as the onset of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , is the merger of gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these systems are a seed for galaxy evolution and are thought to produce luminous and ultraluminous infrared ( ir : 81000 ) galaxies ( lirgs : @xmath8 ; ulirgs : @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "owing to ( u)lirgs nature , both the agn and the active star formation therein are deeply embedded in dust , and hence obscured .",
    "radio observations provide us with an extinction - free view of the merger products , and thus allow us to study their interaction , their evolution and their influence on their hosts .",
    "ic883 , also known as ugc8387 , izw056 and arp193 , is one of the closest ( @xmath10mpc ) lirgs , with an ir luminosity of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a @xmath12kpc rotating ring of molecular gas and dust observed edge - on , and two large tidal tails ( one protruding orthogonally from the centre and another extending along the main body towards the south ) , which indicate the occurrence of previous merger episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found kinematic differences in absorption and @xmath13co emission which they interpret as evidence of an outflow of atomic gas perpendicular to the ring , though they also note inflow ( or other non - circular motion ) could account for the velocity differences .",
    "it is possible that returning tidal material at somewhat larger distances , but seen in projection against the nucleus , could also be the origin of the kinematic disparity between the @xmath13co and .",
    "@xcite classified this galaxy as a low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "posterior analysis suggested its classification as a starburst ",
    "agn composite @xcite .",
    "the thermal nature of the soft x - ray emission , the ir colours indicating thermal emission from cold dust ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the steep global radio spectral index ( @xmath14 ) and the far - ir / radio flux ratio ( @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among other characteristics , provide solid evidence of active star formation in the system .",
    "in fact , ic883 lies close to the well known starburst galaxy m82 in the diagnostic plot of the 6.2 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon vs the 9.7 silicate strength ( with values of 0.6 and @xmath16 , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "support for the presence of an agn in ic883 comes from the [ ne v ] 14.32 emission line detection in the heavily obscured nuclear region @xcite , and the detection of compact radio sources at milli - arcsec resolution @xcite .",
    "the agn has however remained elusive in x - rays and mid - ir continuum observations , where agns are typically uncovered , and hence its presence has been judged uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the starburst - agn classification means solely that there is both emission from a starburst and merger - driven shocks , which together can mimic strong agn emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) of co lines in ic883 , plus emission lines of dense gas tracers such as high-_j _ hcn transitions , and found that the system basically lacks a dense molecular gas component ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) .",
    "this is a somewhat unexpected result for a system which is presumably undergoing a starburst .    in @xcite ,",
    "henceforth , we presented radio observations of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of ic883 using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) facilities and the electronic multi - element remotely linked interferometer network ( e - merlin ) array .",
    "our observations revealed the presence of at least six non - thermal compact components ( labelled as components a1 to a6 ) within the innermost 100pc diameter nuclear region of ic883 ( named component a ) , likely constituting a supernova ( sn ) factory in coexistence with a low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) candidate ( component a1 ) .",
    "we found that the agn candidate is powering the radio emission at both circumnuclear and nuclear scales , as seen with the e - merlin and european vlbi network ( evn ) arrays , unlike the scenario depicted at other wavelengths , where the starburst represents the major contribution to the global emission .",
    "in we also modelled the ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and found that the contribution from a putative agn to the ir emission is no more than 10 per cent that of the starburst , albeit with inherent large uncertainties predicted by our almost edge - on view of the torus .",
    "in this paper we present recent vlbi radio observations made with the evn , as well as archival x - ray data , aiming at confirming the presence of an agn in ic883 , and at understanding its nature .",
    "we also present archival karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) data which has a resolution comparable to that of our e - merlin observations reported in . our study is made within the framework of the e - merlin legacy project luminous infrared galaxy inventory ( lirgi ; pis : j. conway & m.  .",

    "with the aim of characterising the nuclear emission in ic883 we started an observing program using the evn under project code er030 ( pi : c. romero - caizales ) .",
    "the program consisted of three yearly epochs from 2012 to 2014 ( see details in table [ tab : er030 ] ) at the frequency bands centred at @xmath19ghz ( @xmath20 cm , or _",

    "each observing segment ( see table [ tab : er030 ] ) lasted 4hr in total , from which 2.5hr were spent on target .",
    "an integration time of 2sec was used in all the epochs , except for segments d and g , where we used 1sec to obtain a similar field of view as for the other frequencies in the same epochs .",
    "we used @xmath28mhz sub - bands , each with dual polarisation . in the 2012 epoch the observations at 4.9 and 1.6ghz were carried out under project ep076 ( segments c and d ) , and subject to a correlation flaw which made those observations unusable .",
    "we reduced the data in the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . taking as a starting point the evn pipeline products",
    ", we improved the calibration considering ionospheric corrections , radio interference removal , and phase and amplitude self - calibration on the phase reference source , j1317@xmath293425 .",
    "the average peak intensities of this calibrator in the different bands were @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with a variability in the peak intensity among epochs of up to 11 , 18 and 9 per cent at 8.4 , 4.9 and 1.6ghz , respectively .",
    "in all segments , we used j1159@xmath292914 as a fringe finder .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]         we created new images at the same spatial resolution as the deep images , but restricting the cleaning to the very central region , which is dominated by the core and the jet .",
    "we then subtracted these images from their corresponding concatenated datasets .",
    "this resulted in _ uv_-datasets that are core - jet emission free , whose images are shown as contours overlaid on top of the grey - scale maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : deep ] .",
    "the contours represent the residuals , and we identify two putative transient sources with a s / n@xmath33 ( labelled with a * t * ) , and thus correspond to robust detections .",
    "we carefully checked that these detected sources do not lie on top of sidelobes .",
    "there is no obvious emission left after the subtraction of the nuclear emission at 8.4ghz .",
    "we note as well that previously known nuclear components were not detected , hence confirming their transient nature .    to further test the reliability of the * t * sources , we produced natural weighted maps of the individual epochs at the resolution indicated in table [ tab : deep ] according to the corresponding frequency .",
    "the image fidelity is slightly worse than in the deep images as there are fewer visibilities , however we find that the * t * source at 4.9ghz is detected only in epoch 2013 , and the 1.6ghz * t * source appears only in epoch 2014 .",
    "the 4.9ghz * t * source is still marginally detected in a uniformly - weighted map , whilst the 1.6ghz is washed out when using that weighting scheme .",
    "we therefore report only one reliable transient source in epoch 2013 at 4.9ghz , with a luminosity of @xmath34@xmath6 , based on the 4.9ghz deep radio image .",
    "such a luminosity is comparable to that of bright radio sne at their maximum light .",

    "for all fits we used the xspec package and fit the three spectra simultaneously with all parameters tied .",
    "we first tried a simple fit with a power - law model ( powerlaw ) obscured by neutral material using the tuebingen - boulder absorption model for x - ray absorption by the gas , molecular and dust phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( tbabs ; * ? ? ? * ) , with a hydrogen column density fixed at the galactic value in the direction of the source , @xmath35@xmath36 .",
    "this model gives a poor fit with @xmath37 for 57dof and obvious residuals peaking sharply at 0.8kev , and overestimates the flux at low and high energies .",

    "the higher angular resolution _",
    "chandra _ images of ic883 show a spatially extended emission region around a central point source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chandraim ] ) . this extended emission is inevitably included in the extraction region of the pn and mos source spectra .",
    "this emission probably corresponds to hot gas in the galaxy and we account for it by adding an optically - thin thermal emission component , using the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum , fitting the model tbabs*(powerlaw @xmath29 apec ) with free column density , powerlaw slope and normalisation , and apec temperature and normalisation , while keeping the abundance fixed to the solar value and the redshift at the systemic value @xmath46 , gives a slightly better fit with @xmath47 for 54dof .",
    "the hot gas component is always sub - dominant but makes its largest contribution between 0.7 and 1kev removing a small peak in the residuals at these energies .",
    "the ratio of the data to this model is shown in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmmspec ] , where the peak at 0.85 kev , most clearly seen in the pn ( blue points ) is better modelled .",

    "the high - resolution radio data we have presented in this paper provide unambiguous evidence of the existence of a jet in ic883 , and thus , for the presence of an agn in the nucleus . on the other hand",
    ", our analysis of the available x - ray data agrees both with star formation and agn activity in ic883 . in this section",
    "we discuss the observational evidence in order to understand the ongoing physical processes in the core of ic883 .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission is difficult to determine .",
    "the 0.210kev spectrum contains an optically - thin thermal component and a powerlaw with slope @xmath60 .",
    "the former can be produced by a collisionally ionised plasma in a star forming region while the second can be produced by a related population of high - mass x - ray binaries . in this case , the entire x - ray emission can be ascribed to star formation . alternatively , a low luminosity seyfert spectrum could produce the powerlaw emission and photo - ionise its surroundings to produce most of the emission below 2kev , which is also consistent with the optical liner classification of this source .    taking into account the background - corrected _ chandra _ counts in the 28kev ( @xmath61 ) and 0.52kev ( @xmath62 )",
    "bands , the hardness ratio ( @xmath63 ) for ic883 is @xmath64 .",
    "this value is below the threshold set by @xcite for agn ( @xmath65 ) , and is consistent with the average of the goals sample ( @xmath64 , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a slope of @xmath60 , as measured here , is also consistent with a low - accretion rate agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray to star formation rate ( sfr ) correlation of @xcite , considering the sfr of ic883 , shows that the expected 210kev luminosity solely due to star formation would be @xmath66@xmath3 , which is 10 times higher than the measured x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "this discrepancy can be related to a high obscuration of the star forming region itself .",
    "furthermore , the high x - ray flux expected would suggest that most of the observed x - ray emission arises from the star formation .",
    "our evn observations on 4 november 2014 clearly show a resolved core - jet structure in ic883 .",
    "the jet was likely ejected some time between 15 may 2011 and 2 november 2012 hence moving away from the core with an apparent speed of 0.61.0@xmath0 ( see section [ sec : jet ] ) .",
    "such subluminal proper motion is comparable to the apparent velocities of jets detected in llagns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the appearance of the jet component was not associated with a strong radio flare in ic883 at least since 2004 , time of the first vlbi observations at frequencies higher than 5ghz reported in where the core is clearly detected , though even before that , @xcite reported an upper limit at 1.49ghz from global vlbi observations made in 1991 .",
    "the jet is detected thanks to the high - resolution and high - sensitivity observations that were made toward ic883 for the first time .",
    "similar observations are needed to unveil parsec - scale jet components in other agns as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we are probably witnessing recurrent agn activity in ic883 rather than its onset , unlike in the case of ngc660 where the radio brightness increased by a factor of @xmath67 , accompanying the appearance of a new compact source and the production of a jet @xcite .",
    "given the nuclear flux density level in 2011 and its decrease by 2012 ( see table [ tab : xuni ] ) , we can infer there was probably a previous component similar to the one we clearly detect in 2014 .",
    "in we also reported variability in the flux density of the nucleus at 5ghz ( labelled as component a1 in that paper ) in the unevenly sampled period from 2004 to 2011 .",
    "ic883 could be producing jet components continuously .",
    "however , the jet components do not seem to live very long , as we do not see larger - scale jets , not even at a 2mas resolution .",
    "it is thought that a very dense ism ( as expected in the nuclear region of lirgs ) can halt jets moving through it @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the jet with the ism can be probed by means of absorption observations .",
    "however , the possibility exists that absorption also probes foreground molecular clouds which happen to lie in the line of sight @xcite , as seems to be the case here ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) . in ic883 , the absorption reported by @xcite is displaced by @xmath68arcsec ( @xmath69 ) from component a @xcite , and hence it is not probing directly the core - jet region .    @xcite report a deficit of dense gas toward the dynamical centre region ( which corresponds to the nuclear region as we have seen at radio frequencies ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found evidence of a nuclear stellar wind based on the soft x - ray emission and morphology .",
    "in fact , the soft x - ray spectrum can be well reproduced by a collisionally ionised plasma , which is a typical signature of star formation .",
    "we can exclude the presence of a strong x - ray jet , since its radio counterpart is not strong . is the jet clearing its way through the surrounding gas ?",
    "probably not , as it is more likely that the star formation feedback is responsible for the gas dispersal .    what is then hindering the production of large scale radio jets and keeping the central radio source confined to very small regions ?",
    "the reason could simply be that the agn is producing weak jet components which are not powerful enough to break through the dense ism .",
    "the ic883 nucleus has a spectral index between 1.6 and 4.9ghz ( in 2013 and 2014 ) very close to the spectral index expected from synchrotron self - absorption in a homogeneous source ( @xmath70 ) , with a turnover frequency of @xmath71ghz .",
    "this characteristic , together with the compactness of the nucleus ( at a few mas - scale ) , are typical features of the so - called gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also share common properties with llagns @xcite .",
    "gps sources are important as they represent the first stages of powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "gps galaxies have typical luminosities at 5ghz above @xmath72@xmath6 ( @xmath73ws@xmath74 ) .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude higher luminosity than that displayed by ic883 ( see table [ tab : lcx_matched ] ) .",
    "however , it is known that current gps catalogues are biased toward bright sources at redshifts @xmath75 .",
    "the discovery by @xcite of the nearest gps galaxy at the time posed the question whether the low - luminosity , low - redshift gps sources are hiding among or within liner sources @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite presented three nearby gps sources hosted by elliptical galaxies which can be thought of as ic883 `` cousins '' based on the common properties shared by their hosts : _",
    "( i ) _ showing strong evidence of interacting / merging activity ; _ ( ii ) _ showing optical spectra identifying them as liners ; _ ( iii ) _ being low - redshift galaxies ( @xmath76100mpc ) with luminosities below the average for gps galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although ic883 remains the least luminous one .",
    "it has been suggested that the compactness ( on sub - kpc scales ) of gps galaxies is due to interaction with very dense surrounding gas , which is responsible for hindering the jet growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there is now mounting evidence that their sizes can be explained in terms of their age @xcite .",
    "there are different methods to determine the age of gps sources .",
    "for instance , using the curvature of the synchrotron spectrum in a sample of compact lobe - dominated objects and assuming equipartition magnetic fields , @xcite found spectral ages between 10@xmath7710@xmath78yr for such objects .",
    "@xcite measured the subluminal proper motion of hot spots , and determined kinematic ages within the same range . however , @xcite noted that when the morphology of the gps source is dominated by strong jets or hot spots , the spectral age will be a lower limit to the source age .    in the case of ic883",
    "there is no available information about the frequency at which the spectrum breaks and becomes steep ( i.e. , where radiation losses dominate ) and thus we can not determine the spectral age . in an attempt to estimate the age of the agn in ic883 , we consider the formulation for the magnetic field and synchrotron time given by @xcite ,    @xmath79^{2/7}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the filling factor of fields and particles , @xmath81 is the ratio of heavy particle energy to electron energy , adopting for simplicity the values of 0.5 and 100 , respectively ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath82 is the linear size of the radio emitting region , with a value of 7.3pc ( 15mas ) , as measured from the evn images at @xmath83mas@xmath77 .",
    "@xmath84 is a function of the upper and lower frequencies considered and their corresponding spectral index , which in this case is @xmath85 .",
    "from table [ tab : lcx_matched ] , we see that @xmath86 varied from 0.20 in 2013 to 0.15 in 2014 .",
    "this is the turnover region of the radio sed .",
    "we have also determined that at higher frequencies , the core has a much flatter spectral index ( @xmath87 ) , which holds at least from 8.4 to 32.5ghz ( see  [ sec : spec_vlaemer ] ) . using these as lower and upper frequencies , we calculate a radio luminosity of @xmath88@xmath3 in 2013 and @xmath89@xmath3 in 2014 .",
    "we thus determine a magnetic field strength of @xmath90 mg in 2013 , and a similar value in 2014 that differs by only 5 per cent .",
    "@xcite obtained mean magnetic field strengths of the order of 110 mg for a sample of gps sources , in good agreement with the @xmath91 values compiled by @xcite from the literature .",
    "the value we estimated for ic883 is consistent with the values reported by those authors .",
    "it is remarkable that even though ic883 is also an advanced merger , its magnetic field strength exceeds by at least an order of magnitude that of other sources belonging to the same class @xcite .",
    "we can now calculate the lifetime of the electrons with minimum energy moving in such a magnetic field and at a frequency @xmath92 ( considered here as 8.4ghz ) as : @xmath93^{-1/2}\\ ] ] @xcite , resulting in an age of @xmath94yr , which is at the lower end of the typical age range for gps galaxies .",
    "an estimate of the electron lifetime according to @xcite leads to basically the same result ( @xmath95yr ) . in the following ,",
    "we adopt an age of @xmath7yr for the ic883 core .",
    "in we estimated a core - collapse sn ( ccsn ) rate of @xmath96yr@xmath74 and a sfr@xmath97185yr@xmath74 for ic883 .",
    "such high rates make ic883 a prime target for ccsn searches using high - spatial resolution radio and near - ir observations .",
    "we have concatenated all the evn epochs to produce deep images of ic883 at different frequencies to facilitate the sn search .",
    "we detected a transient source at 4.9ghz in 2013 with a luminosity comparable to that of luminous radio sne and give further evidence of the ongoing star formation activity in the nuclear regions of ic883 .",
    "if the transient is indeed a sn , it seems to evolve fast , as we do not detect it in consecutive yearly epochs and it appears at only one frequency at a time .",
    "another possibility is that this is a slowly evolving sn and it appears to be caught close to its maximum light , and had already fallen below the detection limit in a timespan of a year .    on account of ic883 s distance ,",
    "the discovery of transients in the radio is biased to only the brightest sne .",
    "sne 2010cu and 2011hi exploded in the circumnuclear regions of ic883 and were detected in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "these are likely type iip events based on their near - ir light - curves and radio upper limits @xcite .",
    "type iip sne can easily go unnoticed at radio wavelengths as they typically have low peak luminosities ( @xmath98@xmath6 ) .",
    "this would imply that the transients we detect , if they are sne , are either type ib / c ( which are bright and evolve fast ) , or are relatively bright type ii s caught close to their maximum light , falling below our detection limits rather soon . in both cases , we do not expect to detect them in consecutive yearly epochs .",
    "we do not detect non - thermal milliarcsec radio sources off the ic883 nuclear region .",
    "however , we note that there are large amounts of molecular gas throughout the system . the largest concentration of gas is located in component b2a ( labelled as c1 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is also near the explosion site of sne 2010cu and 2011hi .",
    "the molecular mass in b2a is about twice as much as in the central component a ( i.e. , c3 ) .",
    "@xcite noticed that the spectral index in the nuclear region ( a ) is quite flat ( consistent with an agn nature ) and steeper in the rest of the system ( in agreement with active star formation ) .",
    "it is thus likely that the peak of star formation in ic883 is off - nuclear ( as seen in e.g. , the antennae galaxies , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but yielding a dimmer population of sne like sne 2010cu and 2011hi that are not easily detected at the radio .",
    "the starburst in ic883 seems to dominate the global emission at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "however , the detection of the mas - scale jet in ic883 , together with the high brightness temperature ( @xmath99k ) radio core , the measured spectral index and the flux density variability , indicate that the central component is non - thermal and related to the presence of an agn , which clearly dominates the nuclear radio emission .",
    "this has only been possible owing to high - resolution radio observations that allowed us to disentangle the nuclear region .",
    "there is , however , no observational measurement of the mass of the central bh ( @xmath100 ) in ic883 .",
    "this lirg is not a classical bulge galaxy nor an elliptical , however , @xcite found that its 1.6 light profile is better fitted by a @xmath101 law rather than by an exponential disk , thus implying an elliptical - like bulge .",
    "it should also be considered that ic883 is an advanced merger , and although @xmath102 can have oscillations owing to departures of the system from dynamical relaxation , it is considered that after coalescence , as in this case , such fluctuations are not large @xcite",

    "llagns usually also have a low - ionisation power , and thus lack coronal lines .",
    "the typical eddington factors ( @xmath107 ) of llagns are of the order of @xmath108@xmath109 , which makes them low - accretion rate agns @xcite .",
    "is ic883 a true llagn even though a coronal line ( [ ne v ] 14.32 ) has been detected in it ? to investigate this , we first determine the mass accretion rate for ic883 . for doing this we should calculate @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the jet kinematic luminosity , and @xmath112 is the agn bolometric luminosity . according to equation 6 from @xcite , @xmath111 can be derived from its correlation with the core radio luminosity at 5ghz . using our vlbi measurements ( table [ tab : lcx_matched ] ) , we estimate @xmath113 ( 4.4  5.0 ) @xmath114@xmath3 .",
    "we also know that the [ ne v ] 14.32 emission line is detected in ic883 with a flux density of @xmath115 w / m@xmath116 @xcite , i.e. , with a luminosity of @xmath117  @xmath118@xmath3 not corrected for extinction .",
    "since the [ ne v ] line has an ionisation potential that is too high to be created solely by star formation , we can estimate the bolometric agn luminosity ( @xmath112 ) for the source using equation 1 from @xcite , such that @xmath119  @xmath120@xmath3 .",
    "we find that the eddington factor for the agn in ic883 is @xmath121  @xmath122 , and thus , within the range of values found for low - accretion rate agns .",
    "@xcite found that the primary accretion energy output for llagns with a compact radio core is @xmath111 .",
    "however , in the case of ic883 we find that @xmath112 is the main contributor to the emitted luminosity",
    ". this could indicate that either the mass of the black hole based on the stellar mass of the surrounding bulge has been underestimated and/or the [ ne v ] luminosity has an important contribution from a young starburst with a significant population of massive stars ( wolf - rayet or o - type stars ) , as might be the case in optically classified starbursts @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the values we find for @xmath100 and @xmath112 fit better within the distribution of normal agns rather than within the llagn category , whereas when looking at the distribution in terms of the eddington factor vs. @xmath112 , ic883 falls at the limit between llagns and normal agns ( figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "this apparent discrepancy might be related to the fact that ic883 is an advanced merger in its transition to become an agn dominated source .",
    "radio observations provide solid evidence for the presence of an agn , and it is thus reasonable to look for an x - ray counterpart , although as in the case of other lirgs , the agn in ic883 might be highly obscured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) thus hindering the detection of an agn contribution at energies lower than 10kev . using the @xmath100 value we have estimated from the bulge - mass relationship , we can infer the x - ray luminosity of the agn by means of the fundamental plane of bh activity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 5 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath123  @xmath124@xmath3 , which is significantly larger than the total observed luminosity .",
    "one plausible explanation is that the agn is obscured by compton - thick ( @xmath125@xmath36 ) material , as has been suggested previously by @xcite based on the observed high column densities , and by @xcite based on the mid - ir  x - ray correlation . assuming a column density of @xmath126@xmath36 , the agn observed luminosity would decrease down to @xmath127@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a very obscured agn contributing @xmath12810 per cent of the total observed x - ray luminosity we reported in ",
    "[ sec : xray ] .",
    "compton - thick agns are rather common in the local universe , and are believed to represent @xmath1282030 per cent of the whole agn population @xcite .",
    "hence , observations at energies @xmath129kev can help to unveil a heavily obscured agn in the system , as done for ngc6286 @xcite .",
    "it is possible now to calculate the ir luminosity of the dust around the agn from the unobscured 210kev luminosity . for this",
    ", we use the empirical relationship for the agn thermal emission presented by @xcite .",
    "we obtain a luminosity of @xmath130  2.5@xmath131@xmath3 . comparing this value with the ir luminosity of the system ( @xmath132@xmath3 ) , we find that the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is below two per cent , consistent with the sed fitting presented in .",
    "the properties that the agn in ic883 has in common with gps sources are indicative of a short age ( @xmath133yr ) .",
    "if the agn in ic883 was more powerful in the past and produced kpc - scale jets , we should be able to detect them in the mhz regime with e.g. , the low fequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "@xcite reported the case of a radio galaxy within the abell407 cluster , which is characterised by a steep spectrum all the way from @xmath134mhz to a few ghz in frequency and displays kpc - scale radio lobes , and thus shows evidence for past agn activity .",
    "indeed , gps sources have rarely been found in connection with relic emission @xcite .",
    "the observed gps - like spectrum in ic883 , highly inverted at low frequencies , and the absence of large scale jet emission , indicate that this scenario is not plausible and the gps - like core should be young .",
    "this would also explain why we do not see more evidence of it at other wavelengths .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that there is a delay of a few hundred million years for the agn to dominate the mid - ir emission after the merger has taken place .",
    "the agn is apparently in an early stage in its evolution , in agreement with a gps scenario . from the infrared sed",
    "fitting in , the age of the starburst would be 55myr .",
    "although estimates of starburst age from radiative transfer model fits to the infrared sed are uncertain , we note that the mid - ir spectrum displays very strong pah features which in the @xcite model is an indication of a fairly old age .",
    "this agrees well with the lack of a dense molcular gas component reported by @xcite .",
    "the starburst is thus much older than the putative age of the agn core , and therefore , it is reasonable to assume at least that the agn did not trigger the starburst .",
    "we performed three yearly epochs of multi - frequency evn observations toward ic883 .",
    "our @xmath135mas resolution observations at 8.4ghz reveal for the first time a core - jet morphology in the nucleus of ic883 .",
    "the parsec - scale jet is subluminal ( 0.61@xmath0 ) , similar to those found in other llagns .",
    "however , ic883 displays more properties in common with normal agns .",
    "x - ray analysis is inconclusive about the origin of this emission , either agn or sf . to estimate the contribution of an agn to the x - ray luminosity , we resort to the use of the black hole mass obtained by means of its correlation with the mass of the bulge .",
    "we estimated @xmath104 .",
    "this is only slightly less massive than the radio - loud agn in the host of the second closest gps source ( ic1459 ; * ? ? ?",
    "plugging in the @xmath100 value in the fundamental plane of bh activity , we find that the agn in ic883 would have a @xmath123  @xmath124@xmath3 , with a contribution to the observed luminosity down to ten per cent if it is a compton - thick agn , as is likely the case",
    ". observations at higher energies are needed to corroborate our estimates .",
    "the star formation is clearly powering the energetics of ic883 at all wavelengths , with the agn contributing only less than two per cent of the total ir luminosity . at radio wavelengths however , an agn is dominating the nuclear emission .",
    "the apparent discrepancies among the interpretation of different diagnostic tools could simply be pointing to the transitional nature of ic883 from a very active star formation phase , to an agn dominated one which at the moment is presumably in an early phase .",
    "the radio sed of the ic883 core is characterised by a highly inverted spectral index ( @xmath136 ) with a turnover at low frequencies ( @xmath4ghz ) .",
    "this fact , together with the compactness of the nucleus , make ic883 a candidate for a gps source embedded in an advanced merger which remarkably is still actively forming stars . based on its radio luminosity and linear size , we determine a magnetic field strength of @xmath137 mg , which agrees with typical values for gps sources , but being significantly larger than for advanced mergers .",
    "correspondingly , we estimate an approximate age for the source of 3@xmath138yr . together with the galaxies studied by @xcite",
    ", ic883 is potentially one of the nearest and youngest gps galaxies and by far the least luminous one , being three orders of magnitude less luminous than is typical .    from the available observations , we infer that the radio sed of the ic883 core is quite flat over a wide frequency range ( 8.4  32.5ghz ) .",
    "ic883 could then be classified as a mere flat - spectrum source rather than a gps @xcite .",
    "however , the flat - spectrum sources to which @xcite refer are quasars and bl lacs , which are known to be highly variable . in this case , although there is some flux density variability , the spectrum is quite similar in both 2013 and 2014 .",
    "we note that @xcite sampled the sed of several bona - fide gps sources and candidates and found at least two within the gps category which show flat spectral indices over a wide frequency range , similar to what ic883 is displaying . the sampling of the sed at higher frequencies is certainly missing and currently there is no available information on the optically - thin part of the spectrum .",
    "once this is attained , we will be able to confirm or rule out the gps nature of the ic883 core .",
    "optical imaging has proved that there must be a relation between merging / interacting systems and gps sources @xcite .",
    "however , it is rather uncommon that gps sources are hosted by active star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , there is to our knowledge only one more case in the literature .",
    "@xcite reported on a radio - loud agn with kpc - scale jets and radio spectra similar to that of gps sources , embedded in a star - forming ulirg .",
    "ic883 is also hosted by a lirg galaxy , but remains the least luminous gps source , and the youngest one ever found in a very active star forming environment .",
    "gps sources have been more easily identified at high redshifts and current samples are biased toward high luminosity sources @xcite .",
    "the low - luminosity population remains relatively unknown and poorly sampled .",
    "our study thus opens a new window to investigate the physical environments of low - luminosity , young gps sources , which can potentially be a numerous population among lirgs in an advanced merger stage , but have so far been missed presumably owing to the lack of high - resolution , high - sensitivity radio data ."
