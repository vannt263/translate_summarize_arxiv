    "a considerable number of scientific application domains promote a mathematical modelling which is centered on a quality information that projects over decision variables . for",
    "some application domains the decision variables may be payoff attached to evolutionary games , as in evolutionary game theory defining payoff landscapes  @xcite , or trading strategies as in financial market analysis , which entails profit landscapes  @xcite .",
    "further examples of decision variables are conformations of molecular entities or spatial positions of interacting molecules as in the theory of spin glasses or folding and energy relaxation in proteins and nucleic acids , which uses energy landscapes  @xcite , or cluster structures in large data analysis , which employs cost landscapes  @xcite , or control variables of electromagnetic fields as in quantum dynamics , which defines control landscapes  @xcite .",
    "lastly , and arguable most prominently , the variables may be genotypes or search space elements , as in evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation defining fitness landscapes  @xcite .",
    "the common denominator of all these modelling paradigms is that they permit the geographical metaphor of a landscape as the quality information can be interpreted as height with high ( or low ) values forming peaks ( or valleys ) .",
    "there is a further common feature in all these landscape approaches . deriving useful information from the landscape",
    "requires a notion of how many maxima ( or minima ) there are , and how they are distributed and accessible .",
    "this is connected with studying if there are regularities , pattern and invariances over varying dimensions and/or scales .",
    "the second common feature frequently culminates in defining metrics of the landscapes , for instance by landscape measures or other invariant quantities such as fractal dimensions .",
    "these landscape metrics have the advantage to be applicable to landscapes of higher dimensions for which the geographical metaphor might be rather hard to interpret or even outright meaningless .    the application domain considered in this paper",
    "is analyzing and controlling chaotic systems .",
    "more specifically , control is studied that uses chaos to direct trajectories to targets , and a landscape modelling is employed .",
    "targeting control exploits specific properties of chaos , namely orbit density and ergodicity , and employs tiny perturbations to system parameters for making the trajectory visiting preselected points on the chaotic attractor .",
    "consequently , the perturbations to the system parameters are the decision variables , while the success of the control is measured as the distance between intended target and actual hit .",
    "thus , finding the targeting control can be interpreted as solving an optimization problem and it has been shown that this optimization problem poses a dynamic fitness landscape  @xcite . in this paper",
    "these results are extended from dynamic 1d landscapes to dynamic 2d landscapes .",
    "another addition is that the focus is now put on analyzing the fitness landscapes and particularly on measuring if and to what extend the landscapes are rugged and fractal .",
    "there are several works dealing with fractal landscapes  @xcite or rugged landscapes  @xcite .",
    "this also applies to the field of analyzing and controlling chaotic systems .",
    "for instance , there are escape time landscapes  @xcite , which have shown to possess fractal properties  @xcite .",
    "these landscapes originate from considering which initial states escape the chaotic transients and how long it takes . in other words , the decision variables are initial states , fitness is transient time . although most of these works acknowledge that rugged and fractal are linked , and fractality is even described as an `` extreme case ''  @xcite of ruggedness , the interplay between these two landscape characteristics is still somewhat obscure",
    ". do landscape measures evaluating ruggedness show self  similarity and other fractal properties by varying the scales upon which they are calculated ?",
    "does ruggedness come to an end if the scale of the configuration space variables goes to zero ?",
    "such questions are raised and by using the example of targeting control , general relationships between ruggedness and fractality of landscapes are studied .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chao ] , properties of chaos and their significance for targeting control are briefly recalled , and the dynamic landscape models are introduced . ruggedness and fractality of landscapes",
    "are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : land ] , and methods for numerically evaluating these landscape characteristics are reviewed .",
    "also , a definition of fractality of fitness landscapes is proposed .",
    "[ sec : exp ] reports numerical experiments using four different dynamical systems showing chaos . for these systems ,",
    "the targeting landscapes are analyzed , and their fractal dimensions are calculated .",
    "it is further demonstrated that ruggedness measures such as correlation length and information content exhibit scale  invariance and self  similarity .",
    "the paper closes with sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] giving a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "consider a discrete  time dynamical system @xmath0 with the state variable @xmath1 , the discrete time variable @xmath2 of an integer time set @xmath3 , and a map @xmath4 describing how the next state @xmath5 is generated from the current state @xmath6 .",
    "the system ( [ eq : basic ] ) additionally depends on a parameter vector @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the values of the parameter vector @xmath8 can be adjusted with time and hence be interpreted as a ( time  dependent ) control input @xmath9 .",
    "further suppose that for some nominal values @xmath10 and initial states @xmath11 , the trajectories of the system ( [ eq : basic ] ) are chaotic .",
    "deterministic chaos implies several properties .    1 .",
    "the system trajectory is highly sensitive against tiny perturbations of the initial state @xmath11 and/or the control input @xmath12 . by applying such tiny perturbations , exponential divergence of nearby trajectories",
    "is caused .",
    "2 .   chaotic trajectories are locally not stable ( in the sense of lyapunov ) , but globally form a bounded and closed subset of the state space @xmath13 .",
    "no trajectory starting from this subset can escape it . the bounded and closed set built by the chaotic trajectory",
    "is called the chaotic attractor @xmath14 , and has but for exceptional cases a fractal dimension .",
    "chaos is connected with orbit density implying that the trajectory comes arbitrarily close to almost all points embedded in the chaotic attractor . from the perspective of dynamics ,",
    "dense orbits mean that the chaotic attractor is ergodic in the sense that almost all points in any subset of the attractor eventually get revisited after a certain and finite time interval .",
    "these properties of chaotic systems make it possible to direct trajectories to targets on the attractor @xmath14 by bounded control perturbations @xmath15 with @xmath16 being a small constant .",
    "such a control policy is called targeting and directs the trajectory from any initial state @xmath11 on a chaotic attractor @xmath14 within @xmath17 time steps to the neighborhood of any target point @xmath18 on the same attractor  @xcite .",
    "thus , we intend to achieve @xmath19 with @xmath20 being another small constant .    whereas in principle the control input @xmath8 could have different values for each time step @xmath2 , targeting of chaotic systems",
    "is achieved by using the control perturbations only at the initial time @xmath21 : @xmath22 observing ( [ eq : steurfolg2 ] ) and denoting the multiple application of ( [ eq : basic ] ) by @xmath23 and so on , we can write the fitness function of the targeting problem as @xmath24 it accounts for the distance between the target @xmath18 and state @xmath25 after @xmath17 applications of the map @xmath4 and employing the perturbation @xmath8 .",
    "we interpret this function as a fitness landscape over the configuration space @xmath26 . according to the definition ( [ eq : limit ] ) ,",
    "the neighborhood structure of the landscape is inherent by the metric of real  valued vector spaces .",
    "for a given and fixed target time @xmath17 , the fitness landscape ( [ eq : opttarget ] ) is static .",
    "however , in view of the orbit density and ergodicity , it might be interesting to ask how the problem changes if the target time were to vary .",
    "because of the ergodicity of the chaotic attractor , it might be favorable to wait ( or to speed up ) for one or more time steps to closer hit the target . by using the time variable @xmath27 for varying @xmath17",
    ", we get a dynamic fitness landscape @xmath28 eq .",
    "( [ eq : opttargetdyn ] ) is a dynamic distance function accounting for the distance between the target @xmath18 and state @xmath29 and allows us to analyze the effect of the control perturbations @xmath8 on variable target time @xmath30 .",
    "this dynamic fitness landscape is studied with respect to ruggedness and fractality in the next section .",
    "a static fitness landscape is defined by the triple @xmath31  @xcite . in this definition @xmath32",
    "is a configuration space made up by a finite or infinite number of configurations , @xmath33 is a neighborhood structure sorting @xmath32 by defining what is next to each @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is a fitness function giving every @xmath34 a proprietary quality information . the configuration space can be interpreted as being formed of the decision variables . for the static fitness function of the targeting problem ( [ eq : opttarget ] ) , we hence obtain the landscape @xmath36 , where the space of control perturbations @xmath26 is the configuration space with the euclidean distance function @xmath37 serving as neighborhood structure , and the static distance function @xmath38 of the targeting problem ( [ eq : opttarget ] ) is fitness .",
    "a dynamic fitness landscape can be defined by the quintuple @xmath39 ,  @xcite , where @xmath32 and @xmath40 are the same as in the static case , @xmath41 is a time set of an integer time variable , @xmath42 is the set of all fitness functions @xmath43 in time @xmath44 , and the transition map",
    "@xmath45 describes how the fitness function changes over time . for the dynamic fitness function of the targeting problem ( [ eq : opttargetdyn ] ) , we consequently obtain the landscape @xmath46 , where @xmath47 comprises of all possible @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be constructed iteratively via the dynamical system ( [ eq : basic ] ) .",
    "although ruggedness of landscapes is an important topic , there are some difficulties in how to define it .",
    "clearly , the intuitive meaning is that a rugged landscape possesses ( apart from the global maximum ) a substantial number of local maxima .",
    "this goes along with the landscape metaphor which depicts a structure equipped `` with many peaks , ridges and valleys '' , as kauffman and levin  @xcite put it introducing the concept of ruggedness .",
    "unfortunately , such an intuitive meaning is hardly sufficient to establish free from much debate whether or not a given landscape is rugged .",
    "it has been suggested by palmer  @xcite to define ruggedness by the property of the number of local maxima scaling at ",
    "least  exponential with the dimension of the configuration space .",
    "however , such a definition is prone to the limitation that focusing on the maxima alone does possibly not fully catch the intuitive meaning of ruggedness as other landscape features are also influential , for instance the distribution of the maxima and their accessibility as expressed by the correlation between height and width of the maxima or the abundance of evolutionary paths leading to the maxima .",
    "also , using the definition to evaluate ruggedness requires either a designed landscape with an _ a priori _ known number of maxima , or to numerically count this number , which may be both awkward .",
    "moreover , it is only applicable if there is a family of landscapes with varying dimension for which the at  least  exponential growth in the number of maxima might be established .",
    "a kind of remedy came with landscape measures for calculating a numerical quantity of ruggedness  @xcite . amongst the different groups of landscape measures ,",
    "schemes based on random walks on the static landscape became particularly useful .",
    "these schemes work by recording the fitness value for each step of a random walk of length @xmath50 and forming the sequence @xmath51 from walking @xmath38 .",
    "thus , a series of neighboring fitness relations is obtained .",
    "assuming that the landscape is isotropic , these neighboring fitness relations account for general changes in fitness across the landscape .",
    "for a dynamic landscape @xmath52 , a sequence @xmath53 can be obtained for each dynamic instance .",
    "post  processing the sequence ( [ eq : seq ] ) gives rise to numerical quantities whose values can be interpreted as measures of ruggedness .",
    "however , whether or not exceeding or falling below a certain limit value indicates a rugged landscape depends on several factors including the conditions of executing the random walk . as stadler  @xcite rightly observed , `` it seems to be rather contrived to invoke a stochastic process @xmath54i.e a random walk@xmath55 $ ] in order to characterize a given function . ''",
    "hence , ruggedness measures based on random walks are clearly suitable for comparing different settings of the same or similar landscapes , but not to generally define ruggedness of landscapes .",
    "thus , and despite the limitations discussed above , we may see the number of local maxima as a defining property of ruggedness .",
    "hence , for evaluating landscapes , it may be useful to have a lower and upper limit of ruggedness .",
    "the lower limit of ruggedness is easy to state .",
    "there are zero local maxima , but one global maximum , also known as mt .",
    "fuji landscape  @xcite",
    ". the question of the upper limit of ruggedness can be addressed by the fractality of landscapes , employing an `` intimate connection between roughness and fractality '' , as alves and hansmann  @xcite phrased it ( albeit substituting ruggedness with roughness , synonymously , we may presume ) .",
    "consider a landscape with given configuration space , dimension and ruggedness .",
    "now let the number of local maxima go up to increase ruggedness .",
    "for a continuous ( real  valued ) configuration space with an infinite number of possible configurations , the number of local maxima can be arbitrarily high . however , more and more local maxima need to be squeezed into the same space .",
    "a consequence is that the maxima must be on smaller and smaller scales , and on these scales the landscape becomes more and more similar to the landscape on a larger scale .",
    "this is known as scale  invariance or self  similarity and a main prerequisite of fractality  @xcite .",
    "similarly to defining ruggedness , also the definition of a fractal is delicate , see for instance the discussion in  @xcite , p. xviii  xxii .",
    "this paper subscribes to the definition of a fractal being a set for which its hausdorff  besicovitch dimension is larger than its topological dimension .",
    "accordingly , it can be defined that a fitness landscape is fractal if the hausdorff",
    " besicovitch dimension of the fitness distribution over the configuration space is larger than the topological dimension of the configuration space .",
    "however , while the hausdorff  besicovitch dimension is suitable for defining the geometric complexity of a fractal , it is very hard to calculate numerically . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] reporting numerical experiments with dynamic targeting landscapes ( [ eq : opttargetdyn ] ) , a widely used technique , box ",
    "counting , is employed to characterize the fractality of these landscapes .",
    "counting dimension @xmath56 can be rather easily calculated  @xcite and approximates the hausdorff ",
    "besicovitch dimension , see appendix a.    a main property of fractal landscapes is that local maxima occur on varying scales of the configuration space variables , which suggest several conclusions .",
    "a first is that landscape measures numerically evaluating ruggedness should be scale  invariant and self  similar . for the targeting landscape ( [ eq : opttargetdyn ] )",
    "this means that by varying the scale of the parameters in @xmath26 , similar values of ruggedness measures should be obtained .",
    "a second is that the value of the ruggedness measures should be in relation to the fractal dimension of the landscape . in other words ,",
    "the fractal dimension should be a characterization of the degree of ruggedness occurring in the landscape .",
    "while fractality can be seen as the upper limit of ( scale  variant ) ruggedness , the fractal dimension becomes a measure of scale  invariant ruggedness .",
    "the validity of these conclusions can be tested by numerical experiments , which are also reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "therefore , this paper considers two numerical ruggedness measures , correlation length @xmath57  @xcite and information content @xmath58  @xcite to compare ruggedness of dynamic fitness landscapes of the targeting problem , see appendix b for details .",

    "[ fig:1a]a has a cantor set  like structure typical of fractal set .",
    "this structure is maintained if the scale is reduced , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1a]b , which is a feature of scale  invariance and self  similarity .",
    "the same can be observed for the dynamic landscape ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1a]c , d ) .",
    "here , it can be seen that for small values of @xmath30 , the landscape has no fractal features .",
    "this is due to the fact that for small target times @xmath30 , targeting by small perturbations of the parameters can not be achieved generically . for larger values of @xmath30 ,",
    "approximately for @xmath85 , targeting is possible , and the landscape has fractal features .",
    "this is confirmed by the box ",
    "counting dimension @xmath56 of the landscapes , which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for all four example systems .",
    "the results show that for @xmath30 below a certain threshold , the dimension is equal to @xmath65 , which corresponds with the target time not large enough to achieved targeting . as the target time @xmath30 gets larger , the dimension also increases and is no longer an integer .",
    "the value of @xmath56 converges to a constant for @xmath30 getting large enough ( approximately @xmath86 ) , which is almost the same for all four tested landscapes ( about @xmath87 ) .",
    "there is a difference in the value depending on the initial edge length @xmath76 , where smaller values of @xmath76 produce slightly higher values of @xmath56 .",
    "however , this effect diminishes and finally comes to an end by decreasing @xmath76 further .",
    "this is consistent as the calculation of @xmath56 is done for different values of @xmath88 , if different values of @xmath76 are taken , see also appendix a.    the next set of experiments are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and give the landscape measures correlation length @xmath57 and information content @xmath58 over target time @xmath30 .",
    "we vary the scale on which the landscape measures are calculated by @xmath89 ( solid lines ) , @xmath90 ( dashed lines ) , and @xmath91 ( dotted line ) , and again look at the effect of changing the initial edge length @xmath76 .",
    "large values of the correlation length @xmath57 indicate strong correlations between different regions of the landscape and hence weak ruggedness , while small values of @xmath57 identify weak correlations and hence strong ruggedness . for the information content",
    "there is a direct relationship between the values of @xmath58 and ruggedness .",
    "the results for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 allow to differentiate between small values of @xmath30 and large values of @xmath30 in terms of ruggedness measures , where for small @xmath30 ruggedness is weaker and for large @xmath30 ruggedness is stronger .",
    "this confirms that fractality is directly linked to ruggedness as the dimension of the landscapes is fractal for larger values of @xmath30 , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it can be further noted that this property holds if the scale of the landscape is reduced . in other words ,",
    "fractal landscapes do not get smoother as the scale gets smaller . however , we see the effect that the transition between weak indication of ruggedness to strong indication is shifted to larger values of the target time @xmath30 for @xmath92 getting smaller .",
    "the more we reduce the scale , the longer it takes until ruggedness takes shape on this scale .",
    "this effect is not visible in calculating fractal dimensions as computing @xmath56 is based on averaging over varying scales ( see also appendix a ) , while the landscape measures are calculated for each scale .",
    "the transitions between weak and strong ruggedness vary over the different example systems with the coupled logistic map ( [ eq : couplog ] ) producing the largest shift , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3]h where the graphs for @xmath91 are not depicted as they have values larger than zero for target times @xmath93 .",
    "another observation is that for small @xmath30 the correlation length @xmath57 has largest values for initial edge length @xmath94 regardless of the value of @xmath92 and hence of the scale of the landscape .",
    "this means @xmath57 indicates more smoothness for smaller values of @xmath76 .",
    "this is explainable by the fact that for small @xmath30 no targeting can be achieved and small variation in @xmath8 do result in almost the same value of the distance function @xmath52 . as scale reduces , the smoothening effect gets even stronger .",
    "the results show that the ruggedness measures correlation length @xmath57 and information content @xmath58 are scale  invariant and ruggedness is self  similar in fractal landscapes . by zooming in on the landscape",
    ", we do not reach a scale in which the landscape is smoother , but the same level of ruggedness persists .",
    "this property can not be observed for non  fractal landscapes as to be seen for small target times @xmath30 .",
    "it can be expected that other ruggedness measures show similar characteristics .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that box ",
    "counting dimension and ruggedness measures correlate well over target time @xmath30 .",
    "an exception from this rule are the results for the coupled logistic map ( [ eq : couplog ] ) .",
    "it might be assumed that the reason for this exception is the dynamic behavior of the map ( [ eq : couplog ] ) , as it is hyperchaotic for the parameter values considered and forms an chaotic attractor of very large fractal dimension .",
    "further work should be done to clarify this assumption .",
    "chaos can be used to direct trajectories to targets on the chaotic attractor .",
    "the targeting problem has been formulated as a dynamic fitness landscape and the resulting landscape has been analyzed with respect to ruggedness and fractality .",
