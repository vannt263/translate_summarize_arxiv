    "there is at present great interest in the computation of the gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of a pair of mutually orbiting black holes@xcite . to do such computations a solution of the initial value equations of general relativity",
    "is chosen on some initial spatial hypersurface , and the remaining einstein equations are used to find the spacetime to the future of that initial surface . in principle , one can compute the evolved spacetime only in the domain of dependence of that initial surface , which means that the initial surface must be large , many times the radius of the initial binary orbit , if the spacetime is to be evolved for several orbital times .",
    "the computational demands for such a procedure make it unfeasible for the foreseeable future , although pseudospectral codes can help considerably in extending the size of the initial hypersurface@xcite .",
    "the alternative to a large initial hypersurface is a timelike boundary on the computation , typically at some large radius , at which appropriate approximate boundary conditions are specified .",
    "these boundary conditions are chosen to represent ( approximately ) the condition that no information moves inward through the boundary .",
    "one of the problems that workers in this field have recently turned to is that of appropriate boundary conditions , especially in connection with the preservation of gauge constraints@xcite .",
    "one of the features found in evolutions of perturbations in black holes spacetimes is the final latest - time behavior of the perturbation fields , a fall off in time @xmath0 as @xmath1 at a constant distance from the hole@xcite .",
    "this was first demonstrated for schwarzschild holes in which case @xmath2 for a multipole of index @xmath3 with compact initial support . for kerr holes",
    "such tails also represent the latest time behavior , though there remains some controversy about the value of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "most work on these tails has been done within linearized perturbation theory , though some computations with self - gravitating spherically symmetric scalar fields have also been carried out@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to point out that numerical computations with approximate boundary conditions can not be expected to produce the correct late - time tails .",
    "a rough intuitive reason for this is that the late - time tails are produced by the scattering of radiation due to the curvature of spacetime .",
    "this scattering takes place far from the hole , and depends on the asymptotic large - distance nature of spacetime curvature .",
    "a boundary condition on a timelike surface at finite radius means that the asymptotic nature of the distant spacetime does not enter into the computation , so that the correct late - time tails can not develop .",
    "these ideas can be checked accurately in the schwarzschild background . in this case",

    "computations with simple toy models have confirmed that with such boundary conditions a resonance of the cavity will not contain an integer number of half wavelengths .     for the envelope of the decaying oscillations , divided by @xmath93 , the period of the oscillations , as a function of the location @xmath61 of the outer boundary .",

    "the plot of the heuristic model gives an appearance of reasonable agreement except for small values of @xmath61 , but with two adjustable parameters in the fit , this agreement can only be said to be weakly suggestive .",
    "we have shown that finite - radius boundary conditions prevent the formation of power - law tails of perturbations in black hole spacetimes . in place of a tail , the latest - time feature of a computation will be a new form of quasinormal oscillation .",
    "unlike black hole oscillations , these oscillations are not physical phenomena ; they are numerical artifacts introduced by the imperfect outgoing condition at the outer boundary .    in numerical relativity , these oscillation will probably not be a serious practical difficulty .",
    "the goal of present numerical relativity work is a better understanding of strong field nonlinear dynamics .",
    "numerical codes in the forseeable future will not be able to run long enough for the boundary - induced oscillations to appear , nor are they likely to be accurate enough to deal with such a weak field phenomenon .",
    "these limitations of running time and accuracy do not apply when the lazarus@xcite method is used in a problem involving the formation of a final black hole .",
    "that method uses the solution computed by a fully nonlinear numerical evolution code as initial data for further evolution by black hole perturbation theory",
    ". the nonlinear numerical evolution would , of necessity , use timelike boundaries , but the numerical cavity oscillations would not develop in the limited time for which the evolutions run . in principle , the subsequent lazarus evolution could be used without boundary conditions , i.e. , with evolution only within the domain of dependence of the initial data inherited from the fully nonlinear numerical code .",
    "such boundaryless lazarus evolutions would exhibit power - law tails , but the tails would be strongly affected by boundary effects contained in the initial data inherited from the nonlinear evolution . in practice ,",
    "lazarus evolutions are not boundaryless .",
    "rather , to reduce memory requirements , timelike boundary conditions are used in the lazarus perturbation evolutions .",
    "these evolutions should contain boundary - induced artifacts of the type we have discussed above .",
    "but these artifacts would be miniscule , and of no concern for most applications of black hole evolution , with or without lazarus .",

    "we thank gioel calabrese , manuel tiglio , luis lehner and jorge pullin for discussions and suggestions about boundary effects .",
    "we thank carlos lousto for discussions of the boundary treatment in the lazarus method .",
    "the usual argument is that the error in the outgoing boundary condition is of order @xmath114 .",
    "the wavelength of our `` cavity oscillations '' is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "it would be consistent , therefore , to suggest that @xmath110 should be independent of @xmath115 , and our numerical results are more - or - less compatible with this ."
