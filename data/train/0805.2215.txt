    "figure  [ rho_t ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath4-axis resistivity at zero and 45  t fields . at zero field",
    ", @xmath11 is metallic all the way down to @xmath0 .",
    "this represents a clear contrast with the semiconductinglike upturn in @xmath14 observed at lower dopings of bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath15 @xcite in the pseudogap state @xcite .",
    "we can examine our data within the overall temperature dependence @xmath16 which reproduces the temperature dependence of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "also , it can be as easily fitted by a power law with the exponent 1.3 ( @xmath17 ) ( inset in fig .",
    "[ rho_t ] ) . regardless of the choice",
    ", the temperature dependence is not @xmath7-quadratic as in a conventional fl ; it marks an n - fl state even in the heavily overdoped region .",
    "when we apply 45  t along the @xmath4 axis , the superconductivity is destroyed and the entire temperature dependence up to 100  k can now be fitted with the simple fl form @xmath18 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that sufficiently high magnetic fields destroy all remnants of the n - fl behavior , recovering the all familiar fermi - liquid metal ; _ i.e. _ in this overdoped cuprate there exists _ a field - induced transformation from the n - fl to fl state_.    to follow the temperature dependence of @xmath14 at different fields we plot it against @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ rho_t2 ] .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath19 dependence is observed below a field - dependent temperature @xmath20 indicated by the arrows . at higher temperatures",
    "the @xmath11 data deviate from the @xmath1 behavior as can be seen more clearly by subtracting @xmath21 in the upper panel .",
    "we note that although the change is gradual , the power in the temperature dependence unmistakably changes from 2 at low temperatures ( @xmath22 ) to less than 2 at high temperatures ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the field dependence of the @xmath20 is depicted in the @xmath7-@xmath24 diagram in fig .",
    "[ t_h ] . at 45",
    "t , fl state extends up to 100  k , and at lower fields the fermi liquid breaks down crossing to an n - fl behavior above @xmath20 .",
    "with decreasing field @xmath25 decreases linearly and extrapolates to zero in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xmath26 [ see below ] , terminating at a putative qcp .",
    "we conclude then that in zero temperature limit , the normal state above @xmath27 in tl@xmath2ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is a fermi liquid , in agreement with the recent observation in this system of the wiedemann - franz law @xcite .",
    "next we examine the field dependence of @xmath14 at constant temperatures , plotted in fig .",
    "[ rho_h](a ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the resistivity is zero below the so - called irreversibility field @xmath28 @xcite in the vortex solid state .",
    "we note that above @xmath28 the magnetoresistance is always _",
    "positive_. we recall that in less - doped pseudogapped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath15 the observed magnetoresistance is _ negative _ over a large field range @xcite , consistent with filling of the low - energy states within the pseudogap in the applied magnetic field .",
    "we surmise then , that at this doping the pseudogap is either way below the superconducting energy scale , or perhaps entirely absent .",
    "the superconducting coherence can survive up to a characteristic field @xmath29 , above which the quasiparticle conductivity overcomes the vortex contribution @xcite .",
    "this often underestimates the upper critical field @xmath27 near @xmath0 in high-@xmath0 cuprates ; it is notoriously difficult to obtain from transport owing to large thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , previous studies of @xmath4-axis magnetotransport @xcite revealed that in the overdoped regime in the low-@xmath7 limit , @xmath27 is very near @xmath30 . in our sample",
    "we evaluate @xmath31  t. above this limiting field @xmath32 at low-@xmath7 is strictly @xmath24-linear in the normal state over the entire field range .    to take a closer look at higher @xmath7",
    ", we subtract the high - field linear term from @xmath32 and obtain @xmath33 , which quantifies the deviation from the @xmath24-linear dependence .",
    "this analysis highlights a noticeable deviation from the field - linearity below a temperature - dependent characteristic field @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ rho_h](b ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath35 is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ t_h ] . remarkably and _ consistently _ it follows the @xmath25 line within the experimental error bars .",
    "we surmise then , while the @xmath24-linear and large magnetoresistance is a non - trivial finding in its own right that needs to be further understood , here it clearly is a phenomenon of the fermi - liquid .",
    "indeed , several theoretical accounts within the fermi - liquid picture derive large @xmath24-linear @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we remark that at low temperatures below 5  k the standard fl state is confirmed by the classical kohler s rule for magnetoresistance , see fig .",
    "[ rho_h](c ) . at higher temperatures , where the low field data below @xmath34 [ including @xmath36 no longer follow what is expected in the simple fl state",
    ", the scaling is clearly violated . and while the violation of kohler s rule at high temperatures can be caused by other mechanisms , the low temperature data are consistently in correspondence with the field - induced fl state .",
    "the temperature - dependent violation further indicates that here the magnetoresistance is not simply governed by @xmath37 ( a product of the cyclotron frequency and scattering time ) . from this",
    "we conclude that the observed field - induced @xmath19 behavior is an intrinsic effect and not an artifact due to @xmath37 .    at finite temperatures the observed field - induced transformation appears to be crossover - like .",
    "so now we will ask whether the @xmath38  k terminus of @xmath35 indicates a true phase transition at qcp .",
    "we note the conspicuously strong field dependence of the fl coefficient @xmath39 : it increases with decreasing field and decreasing @xmath20 , see inset of fig .",
    "indeed we find that the field dependence can be fitted to @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the relevant parameters of the fit .",
    "as we discussed earlier , in zero field @xmath11 can be analyzed either by a power law or by the @xmath45 dependence . in the analysis of the field dependence",
    "the two different forms would require different values of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in the former case ,",
    "we take @xmath46  @xmath47cm / k@xmath48 and we can fit the @xmath49 by @xmath50 and @xmath51  t. in the latter case , we use the finite coefficient @xmath52  @xmath47cm / k@xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ rho_t ] ) and the fit gives @xmath53 and @xmath54  t.    thus , experimental @xmath49 algebraically diverges at @xmath44 . within fermi liquid theory , as @xmath55  k the energy dependence of the total scattering rate near the fermi surface takes the form @xmath56 ( @xmath57 comes from the impurity scattering , @xmath58 is a constant in energy @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the fermi energy ) @xcite . at the qcp",
    "the singularity of @xmath61 will mirror that of @xmath49  the two coefficients are related through the quasiparticle - quasiparticle scattering cross section .",
    "the found divergence of @xmath39 thus gives us confidence in assigning @xmath44 as the qcp field , and @xmath43 as the exponent characterizing quantum criticality .",
    "we remark that strongly correlated electron systems commonly obey kadowaki - woods relation @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath63 is the electronic coefficient of specific heat and a measure of the effective mass @xmath64 of a landau quasiparticle . while this relation is complex ( and sometimes violated @xcite ) , we note that with large ( @xmath65 @xcite ) resistivity anisotropy in tl@xmath2ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , the obtained @xmath39 values near @xmath44 imply enhanced @xmath66  mj / mol - k@xmath48 , comparable to that e.g. in superconducting sr@xmath2ruo@xmath67 @xcite , where similarly anisotropic @xmath39 values between the @xmath4-axis and in - plane resistivities have been observed .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath39 and a lack of saturation may also be related to the enhanced susceptibility @xmath68 in the overdoped tl@xmath2ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we surmise then that at finite temperatures the system is governed by the quantum fluctuations , generating the n - fl state which crosses over to the conventional fl above @xmath34 .    the n - fl state with non-@xmath1 dependence of resistivity @xcite and",
    "a violation of kohler s rule @xcite has also been observed in heavy - fermion superconductors having strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "notably , in cecoin@xmath69 with quasi - two dimensional electronic structure , a quite similar field - induced qcp has been identified by the transport and specific heat measurements @xcite . in high magnetic fields ,",
    "the resistivity recovers the @xmath19 dependence at low temperatures in a similar manner near the upper critical field @xmath26 ( @xmath70  t ) .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the underlying antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite become critical in the immediate vicinity of the superconductivity , preventing development of magnetic order .",
    "we note that anisotropic violation of the wiedemann - franz law in cecoin@xmath69 was recently found near the qcp @xcite , where the fl renormalization parameter @xmath71 @xmath72 tends to zero in the @xmath4 direction but remains finite in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath4 direction is more susceptible to instabilities related to qcp .",
    "an intriguing question to ask is whether field - induced @xmath73 in a highly overdoped cuprate is a shear coincidence or are they inherently linked . in particular",
    ", one may ask whether an extended regime of superconducting fluctuations can promote the observed n - fl state . in the heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath69",
    ", fl coefficient @xmath39 also diverges at the qcp located very near @xmath26 , with @xmath43 close to unity @xcite . by applying pressure @xmath44",
    "is strongly suppressed and is no longer coincident with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this rather compellingly points to a qcp controlled by a competing order , most likely related to antiferromagnetism @xcite . in cuprates , neutron scattering experiments @xcite show that magnetic field can _ induce _ a distinct static magnetic order , and a surprisingly much enhanced spin fluctuations at low @xmath7 within the vortex cores , also detected by a spatially resolved nmr @xcite .",
    "thus , spin correlations in cuprates seem to experience a field - induced boost .",
    "our work , in a departure from previous studies , probes the high - field regime at very high hole doping  much distanced from the antiferromagnetic ` mother order ' . that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite could have such long reach @xcite and play a role in the uncovered field - induced qcp is quite extraordinary .",
    "we expect that the true nature of the quantum critical fluctuations that produce the n - fl state in the highly overdoped tl@xmath2ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is complex , since here we are not far from the superconductivity s charge - doping end point @xcite . from our experiments , with salient similarities found between a cuprate and a heavy - fermion compound , all evidence here points to a spin - controlled qcp universal to these strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "single crystals of tl@xmath2ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 were grown by a flux method @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the doping can be tuned by oxygen content covering a range from somewhat overdoped ( @xmath74  k ) up to heavily overdoped ( @xmath75  k ) @xcite . in our study",
