    "the _ swift _ observatory @xcite is a multi - instrument satellite mission that was designed to detect and rapidly localize gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the observatory contains three telescopes : the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , the @xmath1-ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , and the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bat is used to identify grbs and localize them to @xmath3 in the energy range 15150 kev . once the bat has localized a burst _ swift _ slews to point the xrt and the uvot at the burst .",
    "the xrt obtains rapid @xmath1-ray localizations to @xmath4 in the energy range 0.210 kev while the uvot obtains localizations to @xmath5 then repeatedly cycles through a set of optical and ultraviolet filters . over the past five years",
    "_ swift _ has detected grbs at the rate of approximately 100 per year .",
    "almost all of these _ swift_-detected grbs have had @xmath1-ray afterglows , and optical or infrared afterglows have been detected for @xmath6% of them .",
    "the remaining @xmath7 40% of the _ swift _ bursts have no reported optical or infrared detections . in general between @xmath840% of grbs",
    "are dark grbs @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray burst grb  090417b was detected by the bat as an image trigger at 13:17:23 ut on 2009 apr 17 @xcite .",
    "_ swift _ immediately slewed to grb  090417b and narrow - field observations began observing 387  s ( xrt ) and 378  s ( uvot ) after the bat trigger .",
    "the bat light curve showed a long period of emission starting 200  s before the trigger ( see figure  [ figure : batlc ] ) .",
    "several ground - based follow - up observations were made , but no optical or infrared afterglow was detected .",
    "@xcite found a source with @xmath9 inside the xrt error circle @xcite and identified it as an sdss galaxy @xcite and the possible host galaxy of grb  090417b .",
    "@xcite measured a redshift of @xmath10 for this galaxy based on the forbidden oxygen emission lines [ ] ( 3727 ) and [ ] ( 5006 ) as well as h@xmath11 emission .",
    "dark grbs have been an enduring mystery in the lore of grb studies . in the pre-_swift",
    "_ era only about one quarter of localized gamma - ray bursts had an optical afterglow ( oa ) detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it was sometimes assumed that this was due to the response times of ground - based optical telescopes which allowed most afterglows to fade before they could be observed . _",
    "swift _ however , with its ability to train the xrt and uvot on a burst within @xmath12  s of the initial detection , has been able to provide positions to within @xmath13 for most bursts that have been detected by the bat .",
    "the rapid distribution of these positions has allowed ground - based optical and infrared follow - up observations for many of these bursts , often within minutes of the bat trigger . even with such rapid follow - up",
    "observations no optical or infrared afterglows have been found for @xmath7 40% of bat - detected grbs , thus demonstrating that observational constraints were not the cause to the dark burst problem @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to quantify the dark burst problem by establishing operational definitions of dark bursts @xcite .",
    "most recently @xcite proposed that dark grbs be defined as those that have @xmath14 measured 11 hours after the burst .",
    "they define @xmath15 as the spectral index between the optical and @xmath1-ray regimes and @xmath16 as the spectral index in the @xmath1-ray band .",
    "the spectral index is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the flux density at a frequency @xmath19 .",
    "this definition assumes that both the @xmath1-ray and optical afterglows are due to synchrotron radiation from a relativistic fireball .",
    "the synchrotron model predicts that the spectral slope will either be the same in both regimes ( if there is no cooling break between them ) or will differ by @xmath20 ( if there is a cooling break between them ) .",
    "a difference of @xmath21 can not be explained in this model and thus requires that something be suppressing the flux at optical wavelengths , resulting in a dark burst @xcite .",
    "several possibilities have been proposed to explain dark bursts .",
    "first , several studies have suggested that dark bursts may be due to extinction along the line of sight , either in the milky way or in the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that this is the case for most dark grbs .",
    "further , @xmath1-ray observations show that some bursts with no optical afterglows have systematically higher column densities than those with optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "this suggests that dark bursts may be suffering from higher extinction than optically - bright bursts .",
    "however , there is significant overlap in the distribution of @xmath22 values between dark and bright bursts , so it is not clear if extinction is the sole parameter responsible for the darkness of these bursts .",
    "@xcite did panchromatic studies of several grbs that were observed with _ swift _",
    "s xrt and uvot ( i.e. , optically - bright grbs ) in order to probe the extinction in their host galaxies .",
    "they found that the combined @xmath1-ray / ultraviolet / optical data for most of these grbs are best fit using a small magellanic cloud ( smc ) dust model @xcite .",
    "the extinctions in these galaxies were small , with @xmath23 mag .",
    "they also found a mean gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath24 , which is lower than , but similar to , the value found in the smc ( @xmath25 using equation ( 4 ) and table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the the gas - to - dust ratio for a large sample of host galaxies of optically - bright grbs is lower than the smc value .",
    "however , the gas - to - dust ratios in the host galaxies of dark grbs tend to be more like that of the milky way than that of the smc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a second possible origin for dark bursts is that they are grbs located at high redshift , so the lyman break ( or the start of the lyman - alpha forest ) is observed redward of the optical band .",
    "the most distant grb observed to date is grb  090423 at @xmath26 @xcite , so some of the dark bursts could simply be at high redshift .",
    "however , @xcite have found that less than approximately 19% of grbs have @xmath27 , whereas between 25% and 42% of grbs are dark .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that all of the _ swift _ dark burst lie at very high redshifts .",
    "the affects of relativistic beaming of grb emission at very high redshift is poorly understood due to a lack of data on high - redsift bursts .",
    "we assume here that it does not affect our discussion in this paper .",
    "third , the hypothesis that afterglow radiation is synchrotron radiation may be wrong .",
    "this could lead to a different spectrum from what is expected from the relativistic fireball model , in which case the above definition of a dark burst is invalid .",
    "long  soft grbs @xcite tend to be found in host galaxies that are small , irregular , and have high specific star - formation rates @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a median infrared luminosity of @xmath28 for the host galaxies of grbs with optical afterglows and conclude that most hosts are sub - luminous at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "these grb hosts tend to be small galaxies that have intrinsic luminosities similar to those of the dwarf galaxies in the local group . however , some hosts are significantly larger , such as that of grb  990705 @xcite , which was an sc spiral with @xmath29 . to date no long  soft grb has been found in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "all of the hosts of long  soft grbs have morphologies that are consistent with either exponential discs , or irregular structure @xcite .",
    "grb hosts follow the size ",
    "luminosity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and extend it towards lower luminosities @xcite . in spite of their generally small size the host galaxies of long  soft grbs tend to have high specific star - formation rates ( ssfrs ) .",
    "@xcite found a median ssfr of 0.8 yr@xmath30 , similar to what is seem in lyman - break galaxies .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that these properties have been determined using grbs that have usually been localized to sub - arcsecond precisions . in practice",
    "this usually means that the sample of grb host galaxies is restricted to grbs that have had optical afterglows .",
    "the host galaxies of dark grbs may have different properties . @xcite",
    "identify host galaxies for 14 dark grbs and found that they have the same redshift distribution as the hosts of optically - bright grbs .",
    "they also found that these hosts do not appear to be significantly different in size , structure , or luminosity from the hosts of grbs with optical afterglows .",
    "they did find that a significant fraction of the hosts of dark bursts show evidence for high internal extinction ( @xmath315 mag ) .",
    "however , many of their host associations are uncertain , with more than half of the galaxies having a probability of a chance association on the sky of @xmath32 .",
    "as we will show in this paper grb  090417b is located @xmath33 from the centre of a bright galaxy with a probability of a chance association of only @xmath34 .",
    "this makes grb  090417b one of the strongest associations of a dark grb with a host galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present space- and ground - based gamma - ray , @xmath1-ray , ultraviolet , and optical observations of grb  090417b and its host galaxy .",
    "we have adopted a standard @xmath35cdm cosmology with a hubble parameter of @xmath36 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , a matter density of @xmath37 , and a cosmological constant of @xmath38 .",
    "for this cosmology a redshift of @xmath39 corresponds to a luminosity distance of 1.806 gpc and a distance modulus of 41.29 mag .",
    "one arcsecond corresponds to 6.51 comoving kpc , or 4.84 proper kpc .",
    "the look back time is 3.80 gyr .",
    "the bat scaled - map , event and dph data were reduced using the standard bat software available through heasarc .",
    "the @xmath0 duration of grb  090417b was @xmath40  s in the 15150  kev band .",
    "the light curve evolved gradually , and there were no features in the unimaged count rates that might indicate how long the burst persisted in the bat energy range past that time . even at that lower limit on @xmath0 ,",
    "this was the longest grb ever seen by bat or batse @xcite , although grb  060218 approached this duration with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the bat light curve for grb  090417b showed four broad , overlapping peaks in the flux at approximately @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  s , as shown in figure  [ figure : batlc ] .",
    "the 1-s peak flux of @xmath46 photons @xmath47 s@xmath30 in the range 15350 kev was approximately @xmath48  s. the total fluence from @xmath49 to @xmath50  s was @xmath51 erg @xmath47 in the 15150  kev band .",
    "the spectrum was best fitted by a simple power - law function with an average photon index of @xmath52 .",
    "the index did not change significantly during the burst .",
    "all the above uncertainties are at 90% confidence .",
    "the most impressive characteristic in the prompt emission of grb  090417b was its extreme length .",
    "the burst was marginally above background ( @xmath53 ) on the 64-s interval starting immediately after a pre - planned slew maneuver ended at @xmath54 seconds , although not at a high enough level to be detectable independent of the later emission . from that time , the flux increased steadily , to be detected as a point source on - board on the interval @xmath55 to @xmath56  s , and finally as a sufficiently significant source to trigger a burst response on the interval @xmath56 to @xmath57  s. although it appeared to be declining toward background levels , the burst continued to be detected until the spacecraft slewed away due to the changing earth constraint at @xmath50  s.        the xrt on board _ swift _ began observations on 2009 april 17 at 15:26:33 ut , 387  s after the bat trigger @xcite , and ended on 2009 may 5 , with a total net exposure of 1456  s in windowed timing mode ( wt ) and 83.36  ks in photon counting mode ( pc ) .",

    "have been made based on the probability of the nearest observed galaxy lying as close to the centre of the @xmath1-ray error circle as it does .",
    "there are a few exceptions , such as grb  000210 , grb  050713a and xrf  050416a .",
    "the host galaxy of grb  000210 was identified from the locations of its radio and @xmath1-ray afterglow . @xcite",
    "found a probability of a chance alignment of the galaxy and the burst of @xmath310 and conclude that if this is the host then the dark nature of grb  000210 is likely due to dust either at the location of the progenitor or along the line of sight .",
    "xrf  050416a occurred at a low redshift ( @xmath311 @xcite ) .",
    "although technically dark an optical afterglow was detected and was consistent with the standard fireball model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of an optical afterglow and the low line - of - sight extinction suggests that this burst should not be considered to be a dark grb .",
    "the line - of - sight extinction for xrf  050416a is @xmath23  mag @xcite , which is consistent with what is seen for most optically detected grb afterglows .",
    "@xcite note that grb  050713a also only barely qualifies as a dark burst under the @xcite definition .",
    "the internal line - of - sight extinction for this burst is unknown .",
    "however , an optical afterglow was seen @xcite , so it is unlikely that the extinction was large .",
    "the latter two of these bursts are technically dark based on the spectral slope between the @xmath1-ray and optical regimes ( @xmath15 ) criteria of @xcite .",
    "however , in these cases optical or infrared afterglows were detected , suggesting that these grbs were borderline cases of dark bursts .",
    "further evidence that dust is responsible for grb  090417b being dark comes from the late - time softening of the @xmath1-ray spectrum .",
    "this softening is consistent with what is predicted from the dust scattering model @xcite , and requires approximately 1540  mag of extinction at optical wavelengths .",
    "the effects of dust scattering do not become apparent in the @xmath1-ray spectrum until @xmath312  s after the burst . since @xmath1-ray spectra are usually extracted from early - time data ( when there are a large number of photons ) it is possible that the softening seen for grb  090417b has been present in the late - time @xmath1-ray spectra of other dark bursts , but has not been seen due to low count rates . for example , the standard catalogue of _",
    "swift_/xrt spectral fits @xcite uses data taken within @xmath313  ks of the bat trigger , well before a softening due to dust scattering is expected to appear .",
    "@xcite point out that the host galaxies of dark grbs are not unusually reddened relative to the hosts of optically bright grbs .",
    "their analysis assumes that their statistical association of bursts with the nearest detected galaxy on the sky reveals the true hosts of these bursts .",
    "it is uncertain if this is valid for all of the grbs in their sample .",
    "however , it is likely that at least some ( if not all ) of these galaxies actually did host the associated grbs .",
    "although some of the hosts of dark grbs have been found to be unusually dusty compared to the hosts of optically - bright grbs ( e.g. , grb  030115 @xcite ) , there is no evidence that the hosts of dark grbs have systematically higher mean extinctions than the hosts of optically bright grbs .",
    "however , the mean extinction of the host is probably not the factor that determines if a particular burst is dark or not since any extinction due to material that is not along the line of sight to the burst will not affect our observations of the afterglow .",
    "what is important in making a burst optically dark or bright is the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "this extinction can be due to dust at the location of the grb , although it has been suggested that the ultraviolet and @xmath1-ray emission from grbs can destroy circumburst dust out to a few tens of pc from the progenitor @xcite .",
    "one way to get a dusty environment around a grb progenitor is the stellar wind from a wolf - rayet progenitor .",
    "collisions between wind - driven shells of material ejected during various stages of the wolf - rayet star s evolution can trigger the formation of large amounts of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radius of a wolf - rayet wind bubble is consistent with with the distance from the progenitor that we find for the dust along the line of sight to grb  090417b ( tens of pc ) .",
    "alternately , the extinction could be due to unrelated dust in the host that just happens to lie along the line of sight , such as a dusty star - forming region or a giant molecular cloud .",
    "giant molecular clouds have diameters of approximately 100 pc @xcite , but often contain dense cores where star formation occurs .",
    "a chance alignment of one of these cores along the line of sight to grb 090417b could account for the high extinction inferred from the x - ray data .    for grb",
    "090417b the late - time evolution of the @xmath1-ray spectrum can be explained if there is a sheet of dust at a distance of @xmath314  pc from the burst .",
    "this suggests that grb  090417b may have been dark because of either a dusty environment within 3080 pc of the progenitor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a chance alignment of the progenitor with a region of high extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "the galactic extinction model of @xcite suggests that roughly 25% of the sight lines through the milky way have @xmath315  mag .",
    "the modelling of @xcite suggests that most sightline through a galaxy like the milky way , as seen from within the galaxy , have @xmath316  mag .",
    "however , their work does not include clumpiness in the dust distribution , which would lead to a larger fraction of sightlines having higher extinctions .",
    "this suggests that a non - negligible ( albeit uncertain ) fraction of grbs may be located along a sightline with more than approximately one magnitude of extinction in their hosts . when high - redshift dark bursts are accounted for the fraction of dark bursts",
    "is roughly comparable of the estimated fraction of highly extincted sightlines , which suggests that obscuration by dust along the line of sight may be responsible for some dark grbs .",
    "we have shown that the host of the dark grb  090417b is very likely to be sdss  j135846.65 + 470104.5 , an @xmath227 galaxy at @xmath39 .",
    "this galaxy has an overall star - formation rate that is at least as great as that of the milky way , and an overall @xmath317-band extinction of @xmath318 mag , which is dustier than typical grb host galaxies , but not greatly different from the milky way .",
    "@xmath1-ray observations of grb  090417b show the normal temporal and spectral behaviour seen in the @xmath1-ray afterglows of many _ swift _ grbs .",
    "the data up to approximately 70  ks after the bat trigger are consistent with a relativistic fireball expanding into either a homogeneous ism or a wind - stratified external medium .",
    "the cooling frequency is below the @xmath1-ray band between 9.1  ks and 29.6  ks , and the @xmath294-corrected isotropic energy is @xmath319 erg .",
    "the physics of this burst do not appear to be unusual , and thus are unlikely to explain the dark nature of the burst .",
    "after approximately 70  ks the @xmath1-ray spectrum becomes significantly softer .",
    "we find that this can be explained using the dust scattering model of @xcite .",
    "the observed late - time spectral evolution can be produced by a sheet of dust approximately 3080 pc from the burst along the line of sight .",
    "the model predicts an extinction of @xmath30740  mag along the line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with the column density measured from the @xmath1-ray spectrum .",
    "therefore , we conclude that grb  090417b is probably dark because of a dense , localized layer of dust along the line of sight between us and the afterglow .",
    "we acknowledge the use of public data from the _ swift _ data archive . this paper is based in part on observations taken with the nordic optical telescope , operated on the island of santa miguel de la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
