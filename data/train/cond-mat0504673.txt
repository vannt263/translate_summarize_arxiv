    "applications of multiple scattering of light by point - scatterers are often based on the assumption that the scatterers under consideration scatter light independently from one another .",
    "all the scattering properties of each individual scatterer can then be expressed by a single mathematical object called the scatterer s t - matrix @xcite .",
    "this single - scatterer t - matrix is used as a building block in multiple - scattering theories @xcite which can accurately describe many interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "however , the use of t - matrices usually implies that one considers only elastic scattering .",
    "although the restriction of scattering events to the pure elastic ones is justifiable in some cases , it is not necessarily correct for , e.g. , scattering of high - intensity incident light fields @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we will consider scattering of light by two atoms .",
    "the  atoms \" could be implemented as any type of sub - wavelength quantum objects , for example : trapped atoms , quantum dots @xcite , trapped ions @xcite or dye molecules .",
    "if we model the atoms as point - dipoles , we can use the t - matrix formalism to describe scattering of incident light .",
    "alternatively , we can model the atoms as two - level systems , in which case multiple scattering of light can be studied using a master equation @xcite .",
    "the system is then characterized by a density matrix , representing the coherences and populations of the atomic levels .",
    "scattering of incident light then determines the evolution of the density matrix , while taking into account all orders of multiple scattering as well as inelastic scattering of light .",
    "+ the goal of this paper is to compare the scattering properties of two atoms as described by a simple t - matrix approach and a ( computationally much more involved ) master equation approach .",
    "we will show that a saturable single - frequency elastic t - matrix approach agrees remarkably well with a master equation description in the regime of unsaturated atoms or for large separation between the atoms .",
    "+ the new aspect of this work is the comparison of two approaches which seem completely different at first but are in fact closely connected .",
    "we stress that the two approaches themselves , reviewed for clarity in sections ii and iii of our paper , have been extensively studied previously ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section ii by describing the system we are considering .",
    "a master equation approach allows us to calculate how a near - resonant monochromatic incident field is scattered . in section iii",
    ", we consider the same system , and use a t - matrix approach to determine the scattering properties of the system . in section iv we compare both methods . in section",
    "v , finally , we discuss the applicability of our results to other atomic systems .",
    "we start by considering the system shown in figure 1 .",
    "the system under consideration : two identical atoms @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positioned in free space at a distance @xmath2 from each other . both atoms have a two - level internal structure .",
    "the upper level has a lifetime @xmath3 . both atoms",
    "interact with an incident field ; this interaction is depicted by the dashed arrows.,width=288 ]    two identical atoms are positioned in free space , separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "both atoms are modelled as a two - level system with upper level @xmath5 and lower level @xmath6 , separated by an energy difference @xmath7 .",
    "decay between both levels occurs according to the decay rate @xmath8 .",
    "a transition dipole moment @xmath9 , @xmath10 is associated with both @xmath11 transitions . both transition dipole moments are chosen to be equal in magnitude and orientation : + @xmath12 + an incident monochromatic field @xmath13 with wave vector @xmath14 interacts with both atoms . the frequency @xmath15 of the incident field is tunable and chosen near the @xmath11 resonance ( @xmath16 is the velocity of light in free space ) . for simplicity , we have taken the wave vector @xmath14 of the incident field perpendicular to @xmath17 .",
    "this choice of @xmath14 ensures that both atoms always feel the same phase of the incident field , which makes the calculations somewhat easier without affecting the generality of our results .",
    "+ we will now derive the master equation of the system ; the following derivation closely follows @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath18 describing the energies of the systems , the electromagnetic field and interactions is , in the standard electric dipole and rotating wave approximation , given by + @xmath19 + the hamiltonian of both individual atoms is given by + @xmath20 + with @xmath21 the dipole raising and lowering operators of atom @xmath22 .",

    "both atoms also interact through the hamiltonian + @xmath27 + with an incident field @xmath28 with frequency @xmath29 , where the rabi frequency is given by @xmath30 .",

    "reduce to zero . in this regime ,",

    "this result corresponds with the intuitive expectation that the independent scattering approximation ( [ totale,2 ] ) is valid for large separation .",
    "if the saturation parameter @xmath91 is of order @xmath0 or larger and the separation between the atoms is of the order of ( or smaller than ) @xmath104 , no easy analytic expressions for the density matrix exist .",

    "[ e , im , omega ] , we have calculated @xmath105 $ ] using expressions ( [ totale , final , density ] ) and ( [ totale,2 ] ) . obviously , the numerical value of the total field component @xmath106 $ ] depends on numerous parameters such as the incident field strength , the distance between both atoms , the evaluation point @xmath60 and the frequency of the incident field .",
    "it is not our intention , however , to fully explore the entire @xmath107 parameter space .",
    "we only want to point out that differences between both methods do arise , and explain why . + as an example , the field has been evaluated at the perpendicular bisector of @xmath53 .",
    "the field is shown in units of + @xmath108 + figure [ e , re , delta ] and [ e , im , delta ] show the field as a function of the detuning @xmath109 .",
    "figure [ e , re , omega ] and [ e , im , omega ] show the field as a function of the rabi frequency @xmath110 , expressing the intensity of the incident field .",
    "it is clear that if both atoms are in each other s far - field ( @xmath99 ) , or if the saturation parameter is very small ( @xmath111 ) , the predictions of the t - matrix approach and the density matrix approach coincide , as explained above .",
    "however , we see that for atoms in each other s near - field ( @xmath112 ) , the predictions of both approaches deviate for increasing saturation parameter of the incident field . at very high saturation ( @xmath113 ) ,",
    "both approaches again yield the same results .",
    "+ we can explain the difference between both approaches as follows . for low - intensity incident fields , both atoms scatter light purely elastically . at higher intensities , more light is scattered inelastically ( and less light elastically ) .",
    "in a t - matrix approach , the coupling of both atoms with inelastically scattered light is not taken into account .",
    "this explains why , in the case of a single scatterer , the t - matrix approach is exact , why for multiple scatterers , problems can arise when using t - matrices .",
    "the reason for this is that in the regime where the t - matrix approach breaks down , it is impossible to quantify the incident light on each scatterer , since the incident light to a certain extend consists of incoherent light , generated by multiple inelastic scattering between both atoms .",
    "it is then no longer possible to define a single - scatterer scattering property , since coherences arise between different scatterers , which are induced by inelastically scattered light . finally , at very high intensities of the incident field",
    ", both atoms will be completely saturated , regardless of the approach one uses to calculate the field .",
    "this saturation explains why for large @xmath91 , the results produced by both methods again coincide .",
    "we stress that the breakdown of the independent scattering approximation we describe here applies to many other systems . in general , all systems where the contribution of incoherent light is not negligible will experience a breakdown of the independent scattering approximation . if , for example , one wishes to describe atomic systems with gain @xcite or the effect of saturation on coherent backscattering @xcite using independent atoms , one is limited to large separations between the atoms . if one wishes to describe these systems for atoms in each other s near - field , then the atoms can not be described ( from a light scattering point of view ) as individual entities ; they are to be considered as one large indivisible system .",
    "only a description taking into account all self - induced internal coherences , such as a density - matrix description , then produces correct results .",
    "in this paper , we studied the scattering properties of a system consisting of two atoms in free space .",
    "the scattering of incident monochromatic light has been considered , using both a saturable single - frequency elastic t - matrix approach and a density matrix approach . the former method assumes both atoms to be independent , while the latter method does not make such initial assumption .",
    "we found that in the regime of low saturation parameters , or for large distance between both atoms , both approaches yield the same predictions .",
    "however , if the atoms are in each other s near - field and the saturation parameter is high enough , the two approaches produce different results .",
    "this discrepancy is due inelastic scattering of light , which is not taken into account in a t - matrix approach .",
