    "topological superconductivity is one of the fascinating topics in modern condensed matter physics.@xcite in particular , topologically nontrivial superconducting phases proposed in noncentrosymmetric systems attract much attention.@xcite inversion - symmetry breaking in crystal structures induces antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) , and spin - momentum locking of electrons by asoc causes unusual magnetic responses much different from centrosymmetric systems .",
    "for example , @xmath1-wave rashba superconductors ( scs ) undergo topological transition at high magnetic fields , although centrosymmetric @xmath1-wave scs are topologically trivial.@xcite further research of noncentrosymmetric scs may identify a variety of topological phases which can not be achieved in centrosymmetric scs .",
    "recently , a scenario for realizing gapful topological superconductors ( tscs ) was newly proposed:@xcite two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ nodal _ noncentrosymmetric scs are gapped under the zeeman field perpendicular to the momentum - dependent spin polarization axis by asoc .",
    "they become 2d strong tscs of symmetry class d@xcite , when the spin - singlet - dominant cooper pairing causes superconductivity . in sharp contrast to the topological @xmath1-wave superconductivity studied in the literature,@xcite any fine tuning of parameters",
    "is not required to realize the topological order . however , previous studies , refs .  and  , focused on the zeeman field perpendicular to the asoc , and the field - angle dependence has not been uncovered .",
    "we show that pauli - pair - breaking effect makes the excitation gapless under the tilted zeeman field , and then the intriguing gapless topological superconducting phase is realized . in this paper , we study the topological phase transitions in the tilted zeeman field and clarify the topological nature of each superconducting phase .",
    "first , we show the gapful - gapless transition in bulk energy spectrum by tilting the zeeman field . the stability of the gapful phase against a considerable tilting angle is revealed .",
    "second , three kinds of topological edge states associated with topological phase transitions are elucidated : ( 1 ) majorana flat bands in the absence of zeeman field@xcite , ( 2 ) chiral majorana edge states under the perpendicular zeeman field@xcite , and ( 3 ) unidirectional majorana edge states in the gapless phase under tilted zeeman field .",
    "unidirectional majorana edge states propagate in a same direction on both oppositely - oriented edges , owing to the synergy of inversion - symmetry breaking and time - reversal - symmetry breaking .",
    "our arguments are based on the general bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian without assuming specific symmetry of order parameter .",
    "thus , the results obtained below are valid for most of the dominantly spin - singlet noncentrosymmetric superconducting states with nodal gap .",
    "the general results are demonstrated in a model of the @xmath0-wave rashba sc which may be realized in high-@xmath2 cuprate heterostructures and heavy fermion thin films .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : energyspectrum ] , we calculate the energy spectrum of generic nodal noncentrosymmetric scs under the low zeeman field and illustrate the gapful - gapless transition in the tilted field . in sec .  [",
    "sec : bulkexample ] , we demonstrate the gapful - gapless transition in @xmath0-wave superconductivity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : topology ] , we review majorana flat bands and chiral majorana edge states , and show unidirectional majorana edge states characterized by a bulk topological invariant of gapless phase . a unified view of topological phase transitions and associated topological edge states is given . in secs .  [",
    "sec : topology ]  and  [ sec : example ] , we show the topological edge states in @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary of the paper in sec  vi .",
    "heterostructures of high - temperature cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion superconductors are discussed as a platform of the topologically nontrivial gapful and gapless phases .",
    "first , we introduce a general model for noncentrosymmetric scs and discuss the excitation spectrum . we adopt a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian in the normal state and @xmath5 is the superconducting gap function . @xmath6 is the kinetic energy of electrons measured from a chemical potential @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 vector of asoc , and @xmath10 is the zeeman field .",
    "the scalar order parameter of spin - singlet component is denoted by @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the vector order parameter of spin - triplet one .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 take finite value because of the parity - mixing due to inversion - symmetry breaking.@xcite    the bdg hamiltonian eq .   assumes vanishing center - of - mass momentum of cooper pairs .",
    "strictly speaking , cooper pairs may have finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath13 in noncentrosymmetric scs under zeeman fields , referred to as helical superconductivity@xcite , or fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov superconductivity@xcite .",
    "however , the induced momentum @xmath13 is negligibly small under the low zeeman field@xcite , and therefore , the following results obtained from eq .   are not altered by introducing finite @xmath13 .",
    "fermi surface , assuming @xmath14 and @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "( a ) a point node in the absence of zeeman field , which is regarded as a massless dirac cone .",
    "( b ) the point node acquires a gap under the perpendicular field , leading to a massive dirac cone .",
    "( c ) slightly tilted zeeman field shifts the dirac cone .",
    "the excitation remains gapful .",
    "( d ) gapless excitation spectrum under highly tilted zeeman fields .",
    "( e ) spectrum under the parallel zeeman field .",
    "the band gap closes.,width=302 ]    [ cols= \" < , <",
    ", < \" , ]     an important difference from the chiral majorana edge states is that the existence of unidirectional majorana edge states depends on the boundary direction .",
    "the boundary hosting the unidirectional majorana edge states is almost the same as that for the majorana flat bands .",
    "for example , let us consider a boundary direction hosting a dirac cone around which the 1d winding number eq .",
    "this is the case of @xmath0-wave sc with @xmath16 edge . in such case",
    ", the majorana flat bands do not appear at @xmath17 [ fig .",
    "[ residual](d ) ] . in the gapful topological superconducting state",
    ", the chiral edge states would be like fig .",
    "[ residual](e ) .",
    "when the system becomes gapless , band overlapping in the surface bz would occur as shown in fig .",
    "[ residual](f ) , and then the edge states no longer exist . in this way , the unidirectional majorana edge states can also be regarded as a residue of the majorana flat bands .",
    "when the latter appears on a boundary , the gapless topological phase is accompanied by the former .",
    "the nontrivial band chern number does not prohibit _ band overlapping _ in the _ surface bz _ , although it prohibits _ band touching _ in the _",
    "bulk_. even if bulk bands are well - separated in the 2d momentum space , the projected bands onto a @xmath18 axis may overlap .",
    "in such band - overlapping situations , residue of chiral majorana edge states are absorbed into the bulk states .",
    "thus , unidirectional majorana edge states appear on the boundary avoiding band overlapping .",
    "the transition between the majorana flat bands , the chiral majorana edge states , and the unidirectional edge states presented in this section is quite general for noncentrosymmetric spin - singlet scs with nodal gap .",
    "we demonstrate such transition in the next section for the @xmath0-wave superconductivity influenced by tilting of the zeeman field .",
    "in this section , we show unidirectional majorana edge states in the model for @xmath0-wave superconductivity , eqs .  - .",
    "the transition from the majorana flat bands and chiral majorana edge states to the unidirectional edge states is clarified .",
    "first , we show the bulk energy spectrum in figs .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](a ) and ( b ) , which are obtained by the projection onto the @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions , respectively . the tilting angle of the zeeman field , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , leads to the gapless topological superconducting state with the nontrivial band chern number @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noticed that the band overlapping occurs on the @xmath16 edge , but not on the @xmath24 edge .",
    "figures  [ asymmetricmajorana](c ) and ( d ) show the spectrum of ribbon - shaped systems with open boundary condition corresponding to figs .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we indeed see the unidirectional majorana edge states only on the @xmath24 edge [ fig .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](d ) ] . in this case ,",
    "smooth transitions in the edge states are clearly observed .",
    "majorana flat bands in fig .",
    "[ flatbands](d ) are deformed into the chiral majorana edge states in fig .",
    "[ chiraledge](d ) and unidirectional majorana edge states in fig .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](d ) under the zeeman field . on the other hand , the chiral edge states on the @xmath25 edge [ fig .",
    "[ chiraledge](c ) ] are absorbed into the overlapped bulk bands [ fig .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](c ) ] .    although edge states around @xmath26 are counterpropagating and similar to the chiral majorana edge states in fig .",
    "[ chiraledge](d ) , those around @xmath27 are remarkably altered from fig .",
    "[ chiraledge](d ) : a chirality of the edge mode changes , and the edge states propagate in the same direction on both sides of the edges , as schematically depicted in fig .  [",
    "asymmetricmajorana](g ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ asymmetricmajorana](d ) shows an example of unidirectional majorana edge states introduced in the previous section : net chirality of the two edge modes are unidirectional , although the other two modes are counterpropagating .",
    "it should be noted that the edge current of unidirectional edge states are not conserved within themselves .",
    "however , the gapless bulk states compensate the edge current and the total current may be conserved , as pointed out in ref .  .",
    "for this reason , unidirectional majorana edge states are unique to gapless topological superconducting phases .",
    "so far , we have analyzed properties of unidirectional majorana edge states for the azimuth angle of the zeeman field @xmath22 . in general ,",
    "edge states depend on @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ asymmetricmajorana](f ) shows the energy spectrum on the @xmath24 edge for @xmath29 . in this case ,",
    "edge states around @xmath26 are absorbed into the bulk states because of the band overlapping .",
    "on the other hand , the unidirectional edge states around @xmath30 are robust .",
    "as illustrated above , a part of edge states may disappear owing to the band overlapping . even then",
    ", the other part of edge states is separated from bulk bands when a suitable field direction is chosen .",
    "related to the topological phase transition , we comment on the case of the parallel zeeman field @xmath31 illustrated in fig .  [ angle](c ) . then , the mass term giving rise to the gap in the dirac spectrum vanishes .",
    "accordingly , the band chern number changes from @xmath32 to @xmath33 through @xmath31 . it is proved that the band chern number must change the sign at @xmath31 , simply because the field @xmath34 with @xmath35 is equivalent to the field @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 is a critical point of the topological phase transition associated with a change of the topological invariant .",
    "finally , we comment on a previous study of unidirectional edge states by wong _ et al_.@xcite in their model for @xmath38-wave superconductivity the unidirectional majorana edge states appear in an extraordinarily high zeeman field @xmath39 .",
    "their model is characterized by the band chern number @xmath40 , although the band gap is closed owing to the specific choice of the @xmath41-vector .",
    "in contrast to their proposal , our model covers almost all the 2d nodal noncentrosymmetric spin - singlet scs under low zeeman fields .",
    "therefore , our proposal for the unidirectional edge states would be more reasonably realized in experiments .",
    "we summarize the results obtained in this paper . we have studied noncentrosymmetric time - reversal symmetric 2d nodal scs and examine the topological superconductivity caused by the broken time - reversal symmetry due to low zeeman field .",
    "the gapful - gapless transition in the bulk spectrum against tilting of the field has been elucidated .",
    "gapful phase is a strong topological superconductor of class d in the large parameter range .",
    "the critical magnetic - field angle is estimated to be about @xmath42 for high-@xmath43 cuprate scs .",
    "this result reveals the stability of the paramagnetically - induced gapful topological superconductivity reported previously@xcite and points to the experimental realization .",
    "we clarified the topological edge states in the gapful and gapless states . in the absence of zeeman field",
    ", majorana flat bands may appear on a boundary of certain direction .",
    "we proposed a compact formula for calculating the winding number protecting the flat bands . in the perpendicular zeeman field ,",
    "chiral majorana edge states appear in the gap of bulk spectrum , regardless of the boundary direction . in the gapless phase under the tilted zeeman field ,",
    "the chern number is ill - defined .",
    "however , the well - defined band chern number characterizes the topologically nontrivial properties .",
    "the nontrivial band chern number specifies unidirectional majorana edge states on the boundary avoiding the overlapping of bulk bands .",
    "unidirectional majorana edge states propagate in the same direction on both sides of edges .",
    "these topological phases and topological edge states have been demonstrated by analyzing the model for @xmath0-wave scs .",
    "it is stressed that the results obtained in this paper are applicable to almost all of the spin - singlet - dominant noncentrosymmetric 2d nodal scs . in particular , heterostructures of high-@xmath2 cuprate scs and ferromagnets@xcite",
    "are platform realizing the topological superconductivity .",
    "thin films of cuprate scs@xcite and heavy fermion scs@xcite under external magnetic fields may also be promising candidates , because the paramagnetic effect is dominant as ensured by the large maki parameter .",
    "_ note _ : after we finished this work we noticed a related paper appeared on arxiv.@xcite the band chern number and unidirectional edge states in topological @xmath1-wave superconductivity@xcite are studied .",
