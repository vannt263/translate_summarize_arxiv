    "<S> the dark energy crossing of the cosmological constant boundary ( the transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes ) is described in terms of the implicitly defined dark energy equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the generalizations of the models explicitly constructed to exhibit the crossing provide the insight into the cancellation mechanism which makes the transition possible .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the physical mechanism behind the observationally established late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite is presently a major challenge in theoretical cosmology . among many different approaches to the solution of this problem , </S>",
    "<S> the concept of dark energy plays a central role , either as a fundamental component of the universe or as an effective description of other physical mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the essential characteristics of the dark energy model are contained in the parameter of its equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the pressure and energy density of dark energy , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> many recent analyses of the cosmological observational data @xcite obtain the transition of the dark energy from the quintessence regime ( @xmath3 ) to the phantom regime ( @xmath4 ) as a best fit description . apart from being favoured observationally </S>",
    "<S> ( although presently other possibilities such as the @xmath5cdm cosmology are consistent with the data ) , the cosmological constant boundary crossing is of substantial theoretical interest @xcite since it unifies important aspects of many previously extensively studied dark energy models .    unlike the standard definition of the dark energy eos in which the dark energy pressure is given as an analytical function of the energy density , @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we define the dark energy eos in a more general way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dark energy eos is defined parametrically , i.e. as a pair of quantities depending on the cosmic time @xmath7 or the scale factor in the expanding universe @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this definition is sufficiently general to comprise large classes of dark energy models .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with an explicit construction of the dark energy model which possesses the property of the cc boundary crossing . </S>",
    "<S> its energy density has the following scaling @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter of its equation of state @xmath12 smoothly transits from @xmath13 at @xmath14 to @xmath15 at @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the dark energy pressure @xmath1 from the dark energy energy - momentum tensor conservation and the elimination of the @xmath17 term from the expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath1 yields the dark energy eos @xmath18 the most important feature of this eos is that it is _ implicitly _ defined . since the model ( [ eq : denmod1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is explicitly constructed to yield the transition , in order to study the conditions for the occurrence of the transition , we turn to the generalized implicitly defined dark energy eos which comprises ( [ eq : denmod1 ] ) as a special case , but also includes cases in which the cc boundary crossing is not possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are real coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this model leads to the following equation of evolution for the parameter @xmath25 of eos : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> a closer inspection of this equation reveals that in the general case there exist boundaries @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 which @xmath25 can not cross at a finite value of the scale factor , but can only approach them asymptotically . however , for a special choice of parameters some of these boundaries can be removed . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of ( [ eq : evolw1 ] ) for the most interesting case @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 shows that for @xmath35 the boundary at @xmath30 is removed , for @xmath36 the boundary at @xmath29 does not exist , whereas for @xmath37 the cc boundary is removed and can be crossed . </S>",
    "<S> the reformulation of ( [ eq : evolw1 ] ) in the form @xmath38 provides additional insight into the mechanism of the crossing . </S>",
    "<S> namely , when @xmath24 acquires one of the values specified above , the terms in the numerator and the denominator of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : wstar ] ) get cancelled . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of the crossing of any of the boundaries in the problem ( including the cc boundary ) is mathematically expressed as the cancellation of the term corresponding to this boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to construct a model in which the transition can proceed in both directions between the quintessence and phantom regime @xcite : @xmath39 this model is also described by the implicitly defined eos @xmath40 whereas the corresponding generalization @xmath41 also exhibits the possibility of removing of the boundaries in the problem @xcite , which is controlled by the similar cancellation mechanism as for the model ( [ eq : eosgenmod1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the consideration of a nontrivial model with an eos @xmath42 reveals that this model can describe the crossing of the cc boundary for a specific choice of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us mention that apart from the models of the cc boundary crossing in which the dark energy is a separately conserved component , there are many approaches in which the crossing is an effective phenomenon , see e.g. @xcite .    in conclusion , the implicitly defined dark energy eos can describe the phenomenon of the cc boundary crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism behind the crossing is related to the cancellation of the terms corresponding to the cc boundary . in the generalized models the model parameters need to acquire special values in order to make the transition , i.e. the cancellation , possible .    </S>",
