    "the surface of a neutron star(ns ) is widely thought to have magnetic strengths as high as @xmath4 g. the inner magnetic field is assumed to be higher than that at the surface , and may be confined within the crust or may be distributed throughout the entire neutron star .",
    "thompson and duncan ( 1996 ) predicted that higher magnetic fields could exist in the interiors of these so - called magnetars , which are strongly magnetized neutron stars with field strengths several orders of magnitude greater than in common radio pulsars .",
    "soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are considered as candidates for magnetars @xcite , although this assumption requires further confirmation @xcite .",

    "i.e. , @xmath11 ) , when @xmath12 ; when @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "for a massive cooling neutron star , it is the pressure associated with degenerate matter at zero temperature that supports the entire star against gravitational collapse .",
    "if all electrostatic interactions are ignored , the electron gas could be treated as ideal ( noninteracting ) at @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath0 then has the simple form @xmath16^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] with @xmath17 the electron fermi momentum . in the interior of a ns ,",
    "when @xmath3 is too weak to be taken into consideration , @xmath17 is mainly determined by matter density ( hereafter referred to as @xmath1 ) and the mean electron number per baryon ( hereafter referred to as @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "the influence of a high magnetic field on the equilibrium composition of a ns has been shown in detail in previous studies @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the distribution characteristics of landau levels , we introduce an approximate method for calculating the electron fermi energy , which holds in two different systems : an ideal neutron - proton - electron ( hereafter abbreviated to npe ) gas and the more realistic system of baym , pethick and sutherland ( hereafter abbreviated to bps ) @xcite consisting of a coulomb lattice of heavy nuclei embedded in an electron gas ( in the crust ) , where the electron fermi energy is very small @xmath18(1 - 25 ) mev corresponding to @xmath19 erg  @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "our method additionally holds in two different magnetic fields : a weakly quantizing field and a non - quantizing field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath21 2 , we summarize ns structure and ns magnetic field , and consider the influences of magnetic fields on ns matter and some simple non - equilibrium processes ; in @xmath21 3 , we deduce an equation involving @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , which is suitable for ultrastrong magnetic fields ; in @xmath21 4 , a dispute on @xmath0 in intense magnetic fields is presented .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in @xmath21 5 .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . to aid interpretation of later sections ,",
    "we review briefly the distribution of a ns magnetic field and the relationship between the neutron star magnetic field and landau levels .",
    "the details are as follows .",
    "a ns can be subdivided into an atmosphere and four main internal regions ( the outer crust , the inner crust , the outer core , and the inner core ) , where the electron fermi energy grows with @xmath1 .",
    "the atmosphere is a thin layer of plasma which determines the spectrum of thermal electromagnetic radiation of the star .",
    "the geometrical depth of the atmosphere varies from some ten centimeters in a hot star down to some millimeters in a cold one .",
    "the outer crust , consisting of nuclei and electrons , extends from the bottom of the atmosphere to the layer of density @xmath22 4@xmath23 g  @xmath20 , at which the fermi energy @xmath24 25 mev , and has a depth of a few hundred meters @xcite . owing to its relatively low density",
    ", it contains about @xmath25 of the total star mass . at @xmath26 g  @xmath20 , the electron gas may be non- degenerate and the ionization may be incomplete ; for @xmath27 g  @xmath20 , the ground state is @xmath28fe , the nuclei capture electrons and become neutron - rich at density @xmath29 g  @xmath30 ; and the neutrons start to drip from the nuclei and form a free neutron gas at @xmath31 .",
    "the inner crust , composed mainly of degenerate relativistic electrons and non - relativistic nuclei over - saturated with neutrons , extends from density @xmath32 at the upper boundary to @xmath18 0.5@xmath33 at the base , and can be several kilometers deep , where @xmath33 = 2.8 @xmath34 g  @xmath20 is the standard nuclear density .",
    "when at the crust - core interface @xmath35 g  @xmath20 , the nuclei disappear completely .    the outer core , consisting of neutrons mixed with a small number of protons and electrons , occupies the density range 0.5@xmath36 2@xmath33 and has a depth of several kilometers .",
    "when density approaches @xmath33 , there are so many neutrons that about ninety - five percent of particles are neutrons , with only a small fraction of protons and electrons ( @xmath37 0.05)@xcite . for @xmath38 , where the electron fermi energy @xmath39 105.7 mev , a small fraction of muons ( @xmath8 ) appear @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that a three - component liquid ( neutrons , protons and electrons ) is in equilibrium under mutual @xmath40 transformations .",
    "the inner core is about several kilometers in radius and has a central density as high as @xmath18 10@xmath33 .",
    "for the inner core of a ns , with still further increase of density it becomes energetically more economic if some nucleons transform to ` exotic ' particles such as hyperons , pion condensates , kaon condensates and quarks , etc , when @xmath41 is the transition density to these ` exotic ' particles , which is @xmath18 4@xmath33@xcite .",
    "the maximum of the inner core density could exceed this transition density , so hyperons , pion condensates , kaon condensates , quarks and nucleons with large @xmath2 are expected in the inner core of a ns @xcite .",
    "different forms of strong magnetic field could exist in the interior of a magnetar at the same time .",
    "for instance , in the absence of superconductivity , the magnetic field is uniform on microscopic scales , and many landau levels are occupied by the particles participating in neutrino reactions because the fermi energies of the particles are too high .",
    "for example , protons and electrons occupy @xmath18 300 landau levels in a non - quantizing strong magnetic field @xmath42 g at a density of about @xmath43 several @xmath33@xcite .",
    "the neutrino emissivities in such cases are about the same as in the non - magnetized matter because the effects of magnetic quantization on the neutrino emissivities are usually too weak .    on the contrary ,",
    "if in the regions where protons are superconducting and neutrons are superfluid , the magnetic field most likely exists in the form of the quantized magnetic flux tubes ( fluxoids ) , in such case , the majority of the electrons are restricted to the ground landau level by this field referred to as strongly quantizing magnetic field ; in addition to these two types , an important phenomenon under study is called weakly quantizing , which often occurs at low temperatures and high densities , when only a few landau levels are populated .",
    "if the superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars originate from the induced magnetic fields by the ferromagnetic moments of the @xmath44 cooper pairs of the anisotropic neutron superfluid at a moderate lower temperature ( @xmath45 k , the critical temperature of the @xmath44 neutron superfluid ) and high nuclear density ( @xmath18 0.5@xmath462.0 @xmath47 ) , then the maximum of magnetic field strength for the heaviest magnetar may be estimated to be 3.0@xmath48 g according to our model @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field greatly influences the properties of the ns matter .",
    "in particular , for the crust of a ns , when in a strong magnetic field @xmath49 g , individual atoms will be elongated in the direction of this external field @xcite . in this case , crystals consisting of such atoms differ substantially from normal crystals , so there must clearly be anisotropy in their properties .",
    "the influence of the magnetic field on the crust matter structure of a ns is determined by the parameter @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath50 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the first bohr radius of hydrogen atom , nuclear charge number , the radius of the electron cloud in the quantizing magnetic field and the magnetic field in units of @xmath56 g , respectively @xcite ; @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath57@xcite .",
    "the external magnetic field determines the shell structure of external electrons if @xmath58 .    a superhigh field ( @xmath59 )",
    "can strongly quantize particle motion , modify the phase space of protons ( electrons ) , shift the beta- equilibrium , increase the proton ( electrons ) fraction @xcite , change the nuclear shell energies and nuclear magic numbers , and therefore influence the nuclear composition and the equation of states of the inner crust of a ns .",
    "furthermore , magnetic fields @xmath60 g may cause a substantial @xmath61 conversion , and as a result the system , composed of an ideal neutron - proton- electron gas , may be converted to highly proton - rich matter @xcite",
    ". however , magnetic fields of such magnitude inside nss are uncertain and are also unauthentic . to date",
    ", there have been no observations indicating the existence of fields @xmath62 g , in a ns interior ; moreover , according to the virial theorem , a magnetic field @xmath63 g can not exist in a ns because the magnetic field energy ( @xmath64 ) would predominate over the gravitational binding energy ( @xmath65 ) , such that a dynamical instability in the hydrostatic configuration would be induced by this ultrastrong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we now consider a uniform magnetic field @xmath3 directed along the @xmath66-axis . in this case ,",
    "in the landau gauge the vector potential @xmath67 reads @xmath68 . for extremely strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the cyclotron energy becomes comparable to the electron rest - mass energy , and the transverse motion of the electron becomes relativistic .",
    "we can define a relativistic magnetic field ( often called a quantum critical magnetic field @xmath69 ) by the relation @xmath70 , which gives @xmath71 = 4.414 @xmath72 g. the electron energy levels may be obtained by solving the relativistic dirac equation in a strong magnetic field with the result @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where the quantum number @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 for the landau level @xmath76 , spin @xmath77 @xcite , and the quantity @xmath78 is the @xmath66-component of the electron momentum and may be treated as a continuous function . combining @xmath79 with @xmath80 gives @xmath81 where @xmath820.927 @xmath83 ergs  g@xmath84 is the magnetic moment of an electron . according to the pauli exclusion principle ,",
    "the electrons are situated in disparate energy states in order one by one from the lowest energy state up to the fermi energy ( the highest energy ) with the highest momentum @xmath85 along the magnetic field , and the electron energy state in a unit volume , @xmath86 , should be equal to the electron number density , @xmath87 .",
    "it is convenient to define a non - dimensional magnetic field : @xmath88 and the electron momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath89 . using the relation @xmath90 and summing over electron energy states in a 6-dimension phase space",
    ", we can express @xmath86 as follows : @xmath91   ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ) p_{\\perp}dp_{\\perp},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92^{\\frac{1 } { 2}})$ ] is the dirac @xmath93-function .",
    "for @xmath94 , the spin is antiparallel to @xmath3 , the spin quantum number @xmath95 , so the ground state landau level is non - degenerate ; whereas at higher levels @xmath96 are doubly degenerate , and the spin quantum number @xmath97 .",

    "we introduce a ratio @xmath115 defined as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "if we assume @xmath103 to be 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 , then the corresponding values of @xmath115 are 0.889 , 0.905 , 0.916 , 0.925 , 0.932 , 0.938 , 0.957 , 0.967 and 0.977 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath115 increases with @xmath103 and @xmath119 if @xmath120 .",

    "in fact , all of the analytic derivations in this section are based on the solution of the relativistic dirac equation for the electrons .",

    ", the possible interpretations of high @xmath0 are given as follows .",
    "firstly , the electron fermi energy increases with matter density . in the interior of a magnetar , magnetic fields are closely interconnected with matter density , and an extremely strong magnetic field could exist in the depths of the star where matter density @xmath237 g   @xmath20 and @xmath238 100 mev @xcite , and the value of @xmath2 is expected to be higher than the mean value of @xmath2 of a ns , which implies that @xmath0 is also expected to increase .",
    "for example , hyperon , pion condensates , kaon condensates , quarks and nucleons with large @xmath2 are expected in the inner core of a ns @xcite , the maximum of the inner core density could exceed the transition density @xmath239 , the value of @xmath0 could be far larger than 100 mev , accordingly .",
    "secondly , due to the existence of a weakly quantizing intense magnetic field and a non - quantizing intense magnetic field in the interior of a magnetar , @xmath240 could be large , which implies the cyclotron energy of electrons is high , hence the electron fermi energy is also high .    finally , in the case of field - free ( or weak field ) , both @xmath241 and @xmath242 change continuously , the microscopic state number in a volume element of phase space @xmath243 is @xmath244 . in the presence of an intense magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath241 changes continuously , whereas @xmath242 is not continuous and must obey the landau relation : @xmath245 , @xmath246 . for a given @xmath78 ,",
    "there is a maximum orbital quantum number @xmath247 . in superhigh magnetic fields , an envelope of these landau cycles with maximum orbital quantum number @xmath248(@xmath249)will approximately",
    "form a sphere , i.e. a fermi sphere",
    ". the number of states in the @xmath250 plane will be less than that when the magnetic field is absent . for a given electron number density in a highly degenerate state , the stronger the magnetic field , the larger the maximum of @xmath78 , hence the lower the number of states in the @xmath250 plane according to the pauli exclusion principle ( each microscopic state is only occupied by one electron ) .",
    "in other words , when @xmath3 increases , both @xmath251 and the number of electrons in the @xmath250 plane decrease ; accordingly , the radius of the fermi sphere @xmath252 expands , which means that the electron fermi energy @xmath0 also increases . it should be noted that the higher the electron fermi energy , the more obvious the ` expansion ' of the fermi sphere ; however , the majority of the momentum space in the fermi sphere is empty and unoccupied by electrons .    in a word ,",
    "the stronger the magnetic field , the higher the electron fermi energy ; the high fermi energy of electrons could be supplied by the release of the magnetic energy .",
    "the fermi energy of the electrons is generally believed to decrease with the increase of the magnetic field strength for ultrastrong magnetic fields .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows : the non- relativistic schrdinger equation for the electrons in a uniform external magnetic field along the @xmath253axis gives the electron energy level @xmath254 where @xmath255 , @xmath256 is the well - known non - relativistic electron cyclotron frequency ( c.f page 460 of quantum mechanics @xcite ) . in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ,",
    "the energy of electrons is quantized . in the interval [ @xmath78 @xmath257 along the magnetic field , for a non - relativistic electron gas ,",
    "the possible microstate numbers are given by @xmath258 therefore , we obtain @xmath259 where the solution of eq.(24 ) is used ( also c.f .",
    "page 460 of quantum mechanics @xcite ) . in the light of the pauli exclusion principle",
    ", the electron number density should be equal to its microstate density , @xmath260 from eq.(27 ) , it is easy to see @xmath261 when @xmath87 is given .",
    "we then ask why such a phenomenon exists . after careful analysis , we find that the solution of the non - relativistic electron cyclotron motion equation @xmath144 is incorrectly(or unsuitably ) applied to calculate the energy state density in a relativistic degenerate electron gas .",
    "it s interesting to note that , in page 12 of canuto & chiu ( 1971 ) , in order to evaluate the degeneracy of the @xmath104-th landau level @xmath262 , they first introduce the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath263 ) where @xmath264 , and obtain an approximate relation @xmath265 where @xmath266 and @xmath267@xcite .",
    "the authors stated clearly that this relation is valid only when @xmath3=0 , in other words , this relation is just an approximation in the case of weak magnetic field ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "surprisingly , this relation has been misused for nearly 40 years since then . even in some textbooks on statistical physics",
    ", the statistical weight is calculated unanimously by using the expression @xmath269 this expression will also cause the wrong deduction : @xmath270 , which is exactly the same as that from eq.(27 ) .",
    "this wrong deduction is due to the assumption that the torus located between the @xmath104-th landau level and the @xmath271-th landau level in momentum space is ascribed to the @xmath271-th landau level instead of using eq.(28 ) .",
    "thus , the electron energy ( or momentum ) will change continuously in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , which is contradictory to the quantization of energy ( or momentum ) in the presence of intense magnetic field . actually , the electrons are relativistic and degenerate in the interior of a ns , so that eq.(24 ) and eq.(26 ) are no longer applicable .",
    "we therefore replace eq.(24 ) and eq.(26 ) by eq.(30 ) and eq.(31 ) , respectively .",

    "it is widely supposed that the magnetic field is the main energy source of all the persistent and bursting emission observed in axps and sgrs @xcite .",
    "based on the observation up to now ( 10 february 2011 ) of nine sgrs ( seven confirmed ) and twelve axps ( nine confirmed ) at hand , a statistical investigation of relevant parameters is possible .",
    "all known magnetars are x - ray pulsars with luminosities of @xmath275 erg  s@xmath84 , usually much higher than the rate at which the star loses its rotational energy through spin - down @xcite . in table 3 , the persistent parameters of sixteen confirmed magnetars are listed in the light of observations performed in the last two decades .",

    "thus , magnetar s soft x - ray luminosity increases with the increasing the electron fermi energy as shown in figure 2(b ) .",

    "in addition , according to canonical magnetar model @xcite , magnetar is a massive cooling isolated neutron star with no accretion@xcite , and its persistent soft x - ray luminosity should nt be less than its rotational energy loss rate , @xmath292 , so magnetars sgr 1627 - 41 , 1e 11547.0 - 5408 and xtej 1810 - 197 also should not be considered . with respect",
    "to axps 1e 2259 + 586 and 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , their particular soft x - ray luminosities are far from the fitted curved lines , shown in figure 2 .",
    "the possible explanations are given as follows .    1 .",
    "the observed properties of 1e 2259 + 586 seem consistent with the suggestion that it is an isolated pulsar undergoing a combination of spherical and disk accretion @xcite .",
    "this magnetar could be powered by accretion from the remnant of thorne -@xmath293ytow",
    "object(t@xmath293 @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   axp 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , discovered as a 6.4 s pulsar near the carina nebula @xcite , is confirmed to be a dim isolated pulsar with no mechanism to explain well its ` abnormal ' behaviors including @xmath276 . observations indicated a significant decline in variation in its persistent soft x - ray luminosity . for example , between september 2004 and february 2011 , @xmath276 decreased from ( 1@xmath18 2 ) @xmath286 erg  s@xmath84 @xcite to 5.4 @xmath282 erg  s@xmath84 .",
    "however , in accordance with the traditional view on the electron fermi energy , the electron capture rate @xmath294 will also decrease with increasing @xmath3 in ultrastrong magnetic fields .",
    "if the electron captures induced by field - decay are an important mechanism powering magnetar s soft x - ray emission@xcite , then @xmath276 will also decrease with increasing @xmath3 , which is contrary to the observed data in table 3 and the fitting results of figure 2 .",
    "in this paper , on the basis of the distribution of landau levels of electrons , we derive the formulae for electron fermi energy in ultrastrong magnetic fields . we conclude that the stronger the magnetic fields , the higher the electron fermi energy becomes .",
    "however , the traditional viewpoint on electron fermi energy will be confronted with a severe challenge from our calculations of @xmath0 .",
    "if the magnetic field is the main energy source of all the persistent and bursting emission observed in magnetars , this article could be useful in studying the direct urca processes , neutrino emissions and neutron star cooling , etc .",
    "it is expected that that our assumptions and calculations can be used to compare with observations in the future , to provide a deeper understanding of the nature of the ultrastrong magnetic fields and soft x - ray in magnetars .",
