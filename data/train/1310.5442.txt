    "( [ gp ] ) ] , the corresponding 3d schrdinger equation fails to produce the ground state ( gs ) ( loosely speaking , in this case the energy of the gs collapses to @xmath7 ) .",
    "this critical feature is explained by the fact that the quantization breaks the scaling invariance of the classical counterpart of the present quantum setting .",
    "the effect is also known as the _ quantum anomaly _ , alias  dimensional transmutation \" @xcite .",
    "a solution of the problem of the missing gs was elaborated in terms of the linear quantum field theory , which , by means of the renormalization procedure , postulated the existence of the gs , with an _ arbitrary _ spatial size @xcite .",
    "a different approach was recently proposed in our work @xcite , which considered , in terms of the mean - field approximation , a bosonic gas ( rather than the single particle ) pulled to the center by potential @xmath0 , and took into regard the collision - induced repulsive nonlinearity in the corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "the physical realization of the setting is possible in ultra - cold gases of molecules carrying a permanent electric dipole moment , @xmath8 ( such as lics @xcite and krb @xcite ) , which are attracted by electric charge @xmath9 placed at the center ( it may be an ion held by an optical trapping potential @xcite ) . in this case , the attraction constant is@xmath10    alternatively , it is possible to use an atomic gas in a long - lived excited state ( such as a  frozen \" low - lying rydberg state rydberg , rydberg - review , in which the permanent dipole moment grows with the principal quantum number , @xmath11 , as @xmath12 ) ; to additionally stabilize the gas of excited atoms , one may pump it by a resonant laser field rydberg - pump .",
    "the analysis reported in ref .",
    "@xcite took into account the dipole - dipole interaction in the gas too , also in the framework of the mean - field approximation , which amounts to an effective renormalization ( increase ) of the strength of the contact nonlinearity . as a result",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the repulsive nonlinearity suppresses the quantum collapse at all values of @xmath2 , restoring the gs .",
    "an estimate with relevant values of physical parameters demonstrates that the radius of the resurrected gs may be a few @xmath13 m . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis was extended for the dipolar gas polarized by strong uniform dc field , with the spatial symmetry reduced from spherical to cylindrical .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same problem was considered in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry , where , in the framework of the linear schrdinger equation , the attractive potential @xmath0 leads to the collapse at any finite value of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned physical implementations , the 2d gas subject to the action of this potential may be composed of polarizable atoms without a permanent dielectric moment , while an effective moment is induced in them by the electric field of a uniformly charged wire set perpendicular to the system s plane @xcite , or with an effective magnetic moment induced by a current filament set in the perpendicular direction @xcite . however , the cubic repulsive nonlinearity is too weak to suppress the quantum collapse in the 2d setting , only the quintic term ( if it is physically relevant ) being strong enough for that purpose @xcite .",
    "indeed , the experimental realization of the above - mentioned quasi-2d system of polarizable atoms attracted to the charged wire has demonstrated a collapse - like behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if a gas is tightly confined near the 2d plane by a strong trapping potential acting in the transverse direction , then , in the limit of large density , the underlying cubic nonlinearity is effectively transformed into that with power @xmath14 @xcite , which is still weaker . on the other hand , in the same limit",
    "the underlying quintic term will be transformed into one with power @xmath15 , which is sufficient for the suppression of the quantum collapse and rebuilding of the gs .",
    "the objective of the present work is to extend the analysis of the suppression of the quantum collapse for the _ binary gas _ , which combines the intra - species repulsion with the interaction between two species , the relative strength of the inter - species repulsion being @xmath16 , see eqs .",

    "the point of the miscibility - immiscibility transition may be shifted from @xmath19 to @xmath20 by external confinement @xcite , and by linear mixing between the species @xcite , including the mixing which represents the effective spin - orbit coupling in binary condensates @xcite .",
    "the immiscibility leads to the phase separation of binary condensates and formation of domain walls in the 1d geometry @xcite . in 2d and 3d settings ,",
    "domain walls often form circular or spherical shells , respectively @xcite .    in this  work ,",
    "we construct spherically symmetric gss pulled to the center by potential @xmath0 , which acts on both species , or a single one , in the binary quantum gas .",
    "the gss are stabilized against the collapse by the repulsive nonlinearity ( in the case when the single species carries the dipolar moment pulled to the central charge , the inter - species interaction must be attractive , corresponding to @xmath21 , rather than repulsive ) .",
    "the gss are constructed in miscible and immiscible settings alike . in the case of the immiscibility",
    ", we could identify phase - separated structures in the form of spherically symmetric shells , but not sectors ( e.g. , for equal norms of the immiscible components , we have not found states in the form of two hemispheres separated by a flat domain wall ) . in the miscible binary gas , two critical values of @xmath2",
