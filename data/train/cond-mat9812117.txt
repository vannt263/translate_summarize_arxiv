    ", the autocorrelation function has singularities @xmath252 for @xmath253 and @xmath254 as @xmath255 .    in fig .",
    "[ figheis ] , we present results for @xmath256 .",
    "the main peak at @xmath257 for @xmath13 is shifted to slightly lower frequencies at finite temperatures . as in the @xmath258correlations of the @xmath259model",
    ", this peak seems to move away from the exact value for the lowest temperatures studied , presumably due to loss of accuracy .",
    "furthermore , in accord with the observation by starykh et al.@xcite using the qmc method ( @xmath227 ) , a low frequency secondary peak develops when the temperature is lowered .",
    "we should also observe that the way the low frequency peak develops is much different from the @xmath228-correlation in the @xmath260 case .",
    "there , the low frequency maximum can be traced to the fact that we chose the non - symmetric representation ( eq .",
    "( [ nss ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , as the symmetric spectra have a maximum at @xmath222 for all temperatures , division by @xmath261 results in a low frequency maximum in the non - symmetric correlation .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath11 model , the symmetric @xmath246 has a minimum at @xmath222 and a small low - frequency peak which survives upon division by @xmath261 .",
    "the zero frequency limit @xmath262 , relevant for nmr experiments , seems to be roughly temperature independent .",
    "in contrast , it increases sensibly with decreasing temperature in the @xmath259model .      the heisenberg - ising model ( @xmath263 ) is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum with values @xmath264 for @xmath265 and @xmath266 for @xmath267.@xcite at @xmath13 , both @xmath256 and @xmath246 will exhibit the gap , however , a @xmath268 function will subsist in @xmath256 due to the non - vanishing matrix element between the two degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit with total momentum quantum number @xmath269 .",
    "this matrix element was evaluated exactly by baxter:@xcite @xmath270 where @xmath271 .",
    "we have verified that @xmath272 approaches @xmath273 at low temperature .",
    "when reconstructing @xmath256 , the large weight @xmath268 function renders the resolution at finite frequencies poor so that the gap can not be seen as sharply as in @xmath246 shown in fig .",
    "[ figgap ] .",
    "although the value of the gap can be estimated from the spectra , the precision is not comparable to the zero temperature dmrg method .",
    "we should also mention that the spectrum above the gap edge seems to start without discontinuity , as is suggested from the two spinon contribution.@xcite this behavior helps in the identification of the gap value , in contrast to other models which exhibit singularities at the gap edge at @xmath13 . for instance",
    ", the @xmath274 chain shows a square root divergence , when assuming a constant matrix element around the quadratic minimum of the lowest magnon excitations at @xmath275 .",
    "such divergences are smeared out in the maxent analysis .",
    "we have investigated in detail whether high accuracy imaginary time data , obtained from the transfer matrix dmrg method , can be exploited in evaluating real frequency correlations after an analytical continuation . using as a test model the the spin 1/2 heisenberg chain and the maxent method",
    ", we found using the svd and maxent methods , we found that features such as the location of peaks and gaps can be reliably determined .",
    "more quantitative information about precise lineshapes or the nature of divergences seems to lay beyond this procedure .",
