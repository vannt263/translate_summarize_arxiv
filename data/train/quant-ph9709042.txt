    "the realisation that quantum physics enables a computer to solve certain problems more efficiently than a classical computer@xcite has led to a revision of our understanding of information processing in physical systems .",
    "the key feature of quantum physics which lies behind the new developments is , as usual , the superposition principle . in a quantum computer certain properties of a function",
    "can be determined , in a single step , by evaluating the function on a coherent superposition of input states .",
    "a classical computer in contrast would need to evaluate the function on separate inputs one step at a time .",
    "while we are a long way from a complete understanding and classification of quantum algorithms , a number of general features may be distinguished .",
    "firstly , some part of the physical computer , the input register , is used to encode the input states .",
    "typically this involves a set of @xmath0 two - state systems which may be each prepared in an arbitrary superposition state .",
    "each of these systems is said to encode a qubit , as distinct from the single bit encoded in a classical two state system .",
    "as the product hilbert space of the input system is of dimension @xmath1 , it may be used to encode a massive amount of information in a single large superposition state .",
    "secondly we identify another part of the physical computer , the output register , to encode the output states .",
    "the output register may likewise be a set of two - state systems .",
    "finally there is some unitary transformation which correlates the states of the output register and the input register in such a way that the output register now encodes the result of some function evaluation of the input .",
    "the final result is a large entangled state of the input and the output registers .",
    "this unitary transformation is a very high dimensional object , and would in general require a very complicated time dependent hamiltonian",
    ". however we now know that an arbitrary unitary transformation may be approximated by a suitable sequence of simpler transformations involving at least two qubits @xcite .",
    "the scheme described in the previous paragraph has a lot in common with the von neumann model of a quantum measurement . instead of the input register",
    ", we speak of the _ measured system _ , and instead of the output register we speak of the _ apparatus_. however in the von neumann scheme traditionally , we have only considered unitary transformations generated by a single time independent hamiltonian . having seen the quantum computation scheme , this seems to be unnecessarily restrictive .",
    "we thus have a novel view of a measurement as an information processing system in which information in the measured system is processed and written to the apparatus .",
    "the possibility of choosing a much larger class of unitary transformation so to couple the system and apparatus , and to further process information in the apparatus before read - out , is the motivation of our work .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite a method was proposed to make an approximate quantum nondemolition measurement of the number state distribution of the collective vibrational mode of a @xmath0-qubit ion register . in that paper , a vibrational energy eigenstate , indexed by an integer @xmath2 ( phonon number ) ,",
    "was perfectly correlated with the internal states of a number of @xmath0 trapped ions . a read - out of the internal state of each ion",
    "would yield a binary string , of length @xmath0 encoding a vibrational quantum state and this binary string would occur with the same probability as the vibrational quantum number in the original centre - of - mass state of the ion . in this article",
    "we examine what happens if we readout only a subset of the internal states of the trapped ions .",
    "we show that when the vibrational mode is prepared in a coherent state , then various measurements on the ions gives various ( in general unequally weighted ) superpositions of coherent states of different phases . in the limit where all ions are measured the ring of superposed coherent states results in a fock state @xcite .",
    "we show that this can actually be achieved with a _ single ion _ , rather than @xmath0 ions , if feedback is allowed in the computation .",
    "detailed investigation of the phonon number measurement in terms of filter functions reveals a close relation to the walsh function generators recently introduced in the context of searching a quantum database @xcite .",
    "we devote one section to exploring this relation .",
    "in this section we summarize the model of dhelon and milburn @xcite .",
    "the physical system consists of @xmath0 two - level ions forming a ` crystallized ' string confined in a linear rf trap .",
    "this is our quantum register .",
    "we make the usual assumptions that spontaneous emission from the upper internal level of the ions is negligible and that the ions to be cooled into the lamb - dicke limit .",
    "we also neglect decoherence of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "the electronic states of the ions are denoted by an integer @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 the binary expansion for @xmath3 is thus just the string @xmath7 .    in the model of dhelon",
    "et al.@xcite , the interaction between the centre - of - mass motion and the internal electronic state of each ion was mediated by a detuned ( classical ) laser pulse . for interaction times much greater than the vibrational period of the trap ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath8th ion is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the population inversion for the @xmath8th ion and where @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath13 is the rabi frequency for the transitions between the two internal states of the ions , and @xmath14 the detuning between the exciting laser pulses and the electronic transition . for simplicity",
    "we assume that these parameters are the same for all ions .",
    "if we choose the durations @xmath15 of the standing wave pulses to increase geometrically with qubit number as @xmath16 , then the hamiltonians @xmath17 generate a unitary transformation @xmath18 where the electronic operator @xmath19 provides a binary ordering of the qubits : @xmath20 the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath19 are the electronic number states @xmath21    in the case of an @xmath0-ion register , the transformation @xmath22 does not affect the vibrational state , however it displaces the eigenstates of an electronic operator @xmath23 which is canonically conjugate to @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath23 are a complementary set of electronic basis states @xmath24 given by fourier transforms of the electronic number states @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "we start with all the ions in the ground state @xmath28 and an initially arbitrary vibrational state of all the ions , thus @xmath29 to the register , so that it is in the state latexmath:[\\[{\\cal{f}}^- { } |0 \\rangle_e = | \\tilde{0 } \\rangle_e   \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n } } \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1 }     @xmath25 states and the state of the system now reads @xmath31 laser pulses , one for each of the @xmath0 atoms .",
    "we now apply the unitary transformation in eq.([ut ] ) after this interaction we arrive at an entangled state of the vibrational mode and the register @xmath32 where the register is in a superposition of fourier transformed states .",
    "so the final step to get the desired result is now to apply the inverse fourier transform @xmath33 to the register .",
    "@xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 .",
    "we get @xmath35 which is the basis for further investigations .",
    "in this section we assume that the vibrational state of the ions is a coherent state @xmath36 is @xmath37 what happens if we perform a measurement on say the first ion ?",
    "we look at the definition of @xmath3 , eq . [ k ] , and see that the first ion ( i.e. ion number one ) is determining whether @xmath3 is even or odd . so measuring ion number one is projecting the register in either a superposition of even or of odd fock states , depending on the outcome of the measurement .",
    "since the register is highly entangled with the vibrational state of the ions , this measurement will also have an effect on this state : it projects the former coherent state into either an even or odd schrdinger cat state .",
    "this can be seen quite easily by writing the entangled state as a sum of states with even and odd @xmath3 @xmath38 and the even and odd cats are then entangled with the lower or upper internal level of this ion , respectively .",
    "otherwise we have to disentangle the states again , which can be done by applying @xmath39 to the measured state .",
    "so what happens if we do not stop after the first ion but go on measuring the second , the third and so on ? we just project into more and more superpositions of coherent states aligned around a circle of radius @xmath40 .",
    "those superpositions are investigated in @xcite .",
    "they finally lead to a fock state in the vibrational motion , depending on how many ions are used .",
    "for example , if the last two ions are measured and the result @xmath41 is obtained , we project the register in a superposition of @xmath42 states and the resulting vibrational state is @xmath43 the wigner function for this is plotted in fig .",
    "theses results are closely related to work done by brune _",
    "_ @xcite . there",
    "the role of the ions is played by atoms and the phonons by photons in a cavity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above measurement can in fact be done with a _",
    "ion , providing we allow quantum - limited feedback in our computation . instead of the simultaneous application of the unitary operator ( [ ut ] ) on all ions ( which requires @xmath0 different laser pulses on the @xmath0 ions )",
    ", one can apply @xmath0 different laser pulses on the same ion .",
    "the scheme works as follows : the ion begins in the ground state @xmath44 .",
    "we apply the fourier transform operator to the ion , which is simply a @xmath45 pulse : @xmath46 we now transform with the unitary operator @xmath47,\\ ] ] with @xmath48 initially",
    ". then the @xmath49 pulse is applied , producing the transformation @xmath50 .",
    "next , the atom state is read out in the @xmath51 basis .",
    "the result is the least significant digit of @xmath3 ( which determines whether @xmath3 is even or odd ) . if the result is @xmath52 we apply the transform @xmath50 , if @xmath53 we apply @xmath54 .",
    "it is these different unitary transformations , controlled by the result of a measurement , which constitute the feedback in the computation .",
    "we now move on to the next digit by doubling the interaction time of the pulse in eq .",
    "( [ uu ] ) by setting @xmath55 .",
    "following @xmath54 we read out the next - to - least significant digit of @xmath3 .",
    "the rest follows analogously until we reach @xmath56 , where @xmath0 in this case is completely arbitrary ( there is only one ion ! ) .",
    "it might be thought that the measurement would be much quicker with simultaneous pulses on @xmath0 ions rather than consecutive pulses on a single ion , but this is in fact not the case , as can be seen as follows .",
    "assuming that the @xmath45 pulses can be achieved in negligible time , the time of the measurement will be dominated by the time taken to apply the unitary transformations ( [ ut ] ) or ( [ uu ] ) . as pointed out above , to get the desired unitary transformation the interaction times have to be chosen so that @xmath57 if the interactions are consecutive ( whether on @xmath52 ion or @xmath0 ions ) , the total interaction time is @xmath58 if the interactions are simultaneous the total interaction time is just the longest interaction time @xmath59 which is at most a fraction of two smaller than the interaction time for consecutive pulses .",
    "from this calculation we can conclude that for making the qnd measurement of dhelon and milburn one can do perfectly well with one ion , which should make experimental implementation much easier .",
    "however it is worth noting that there are some experiments which one could do with the entangled state ( [ entangle ] ) which are not possible with a single ion .",
    "assume that we do not measure the internal state of the first ion in the register , but perform our measurement instead on the second or third or any other ion , and then disentangle the remaining ions by applying @xmath60 .",
    "the result is not as simple as an equally - weighted multiple - component cat - state , but has an interesting interference structure nevertheless .",
    "essentially by measuring one ion ( whichever ) we set half of the @xmath61 to zero .",
    "for the first ion every second one is set to zero and the result is the standard cat state . for the second ion",
    "we get a pattern of @xmath62 states set to zero alternating with @xmath62 states not set to zero .",
    "in general measuring the @xmath63 ion creates a pattern consisting of @xmath64 states set to zero alternating with the same number of states not set to zero .",
    "for example if we measure the second ion to be in the state @xmath44 , the register is in a superposition of states of the form @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and in this case we project the vibrational state into @xmath68 the wigner function for this state is plotted in fig .",
    "the last considerations in the previous section have a close relation to classical searching as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "an unsorted database which has one marked entry ( i.e.  is of hamming weight one ) and contains @xmath1 items can be searched classically by bit strings of the same length but hamming weight @xmath69 .",
    "an answer of the database @xmath70 to the querie @xmath71 , where @xmath71 is the hamming weight @xmath69 bit string which contains @xmath72 zeros alternation with @xmath72 ones , is a bit @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the @xmath63 bits of @xmath71 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "classically the answers of the database to @xmath0 queries with all the possible hamming weight @xmath69 bit strings uniquely determine the location of the marked entry .",
    "this location @xmath76 is just the number we get after transferring the ordered answers ( i.e.  a binary string of length @xmath0 ) into their decimal form @xmath77 the bit strings @xmath71 play an essential rule in the recently introduced algorithm for searching a database @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors search a database for one marked entry with a single querie which consist of a superposition of walsh - functions .",
    "walsh - functions are all possible `` xor '' combinations of the @xmath71s and the bit string containing @xmath2 zeros .",
    "thus the @xmath71s are the generators of the walsh - functions . since in @xcite",
    "the answer to each walsh - function is stored in the sign of the walsh - function in the superposition state , further data processing to transform the information into @xmath0 bits is required .",
    "now in our scheme we assume that the vibrational motion is in an unknown fock state @xmath78 and our only knowledge about it is that @xmath79 .",
    "we choose to implement the measurement using @xmath0 ions in the trap .",
    "the state ( [ entangle ] ) then reads @xmath80 and so @xmath81 steps @xcite .",
    "the interaction presented here also takes a time of order @xmath82 .",
    "this is because both equation ( [ simn1 ] ) and equation ( [ simn2 ] ) imply a total time scaling as @xmath83 which is of order @xmath84 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform however takes @xmath85 steps @xcite which hence is the limiting process .",
    "so all in all our measurement scheme takes @xmath85 steps .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a measurement scheme for the determination of the vibrational quantum number of the lowest normal mode of @xmath0 ions confined in a trap .",
    "the vibrational state of the ions becomes entangled with a state in the product space of the internal electronic states .",
    "this product state is defined by an integer encoded as a binary string .",
    "the measurement scheme depends on the ability to perform a unitary fourier transform operation on the product space of the internal electronic states of all the ions .",
    "this is a very large dimensional unitary transformation ( of dimension @xmath1 ) , but can be done if we regard the system as an ion trap quantum computer .",
    "this enables a significant generalisation of the standard von neumann measurement model .",
    "however we point out that the same measurement can be accomplished with a single ion , provided that subsequent unitary transformations are selected on the basis of past measurements .",
    "this is a kind of feedback or adaptive scheme .",
    "the measurement readout is done by reading out the internal electronic state of each ion in some predetermined order .",
    "if the excited state encodes a 1 and the ground state encodes a 0 , the result of the measurement is a binary string which encodes an integer @xmath2 .",
    "this result will occur with the same probability as the occurrence of the normal mode vibrational quantum number @xmath2 in the initial centre - of - mass mode .",
    "the resulting conditional state of the centre - of - mass is then a fock state @xmath86 .",
    "if instead of reading out the entire binary string we only readout a suitable partition by making a state determination on a subset of ions , a number of different vibrational states can be prepared .",
    "we have shown for the case of an initial coherent state of the normal mode vibration that the resulting conditional states are in fact superpositions of coherent states on a ring of fixed radius in the phase - space of vibrational motion .",
    "determining selected partitions of a binary string is very similar to methods used in binary search routines .",
    "we have shown that our measurement scheme can in fact be viewed as a kind of quantum search algorithm for a particular integer @xmath2 encoding a vibrational normal mode state .",
