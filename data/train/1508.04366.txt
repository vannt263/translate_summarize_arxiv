    "quoting from the final p5 report@xcite , of the particle physics project prioritization panel ( p5 ) , `` many extensions of the standard model , including supersymmetry , have additional sources of cp non - conservation . among the most powerful probes of new physics that does not conserve cp are the electric dipole moments ( edm s ) of the neutron , electron and proton . ''    various schemes for using frozen spin storage rings to measure electric dipole moments ( edm ) of various baryons have been suggested .",
    "an early design first proposed by farley and others@xcite has , by now , evolved into a design by the international storage ring edm collaboration@xcite ; important steps in this evolution are described in various reports and papers .",
    "they include : overall strategy , semertzidis@xcite ; polarimetry , stephenson@xcite ; squid magnetometry , kawall@xcite ; magnetic shielding , morse@xcite ; error compensation , orlov@xcite ; lattice design , j. and r. talman@xcite@xcite ; spin coherence time ( sct ) , haciomeroglu@xcite and talmans@xcite .",
    "the main recent experimental advances toward the goal of storage ring edm measurement have occurred at the cosy storage ring in juelich , germany , by lehrach@xcite , rathmann , stephenson and others , and described , for example , by stroeher@xcite@xcite .",
    "the storage ring edm measurement proposed here has continued this evolution with major modifications .",
    "the most important modification is the introduction of resonant polarimetry , which permits the edm measurement to be `` moved into the frequency domain '' . this , and other significant differences ,",
    "are spelled out in detail in what follows .",
    "much of the early discussion assumes electrons , but most results are common to both electrons and protons ; even deuterons in some cases .",
    "the current upper limit@xcite@xcite for the electron edm is about 10 in our nominal @xmath1e - cm edm units .",
    "this measurement , using thorium oxide molecules , exploits a 9 order of magnification factor of internal to applied electric field for this molecule , helped also by a conveniently small molecular mdm .    by constrast",
    "our storage ring trap measurement will measure the free electron edm , using a much larger external electric field , but without benefit of the molecular polarizability magnification factor .",
    "the expected instrumental precision ( i.e. not including systematic errors ) corresponds to an edm value of @xmath0e - cm .",
    "this is 100 times smaller than the current electron edm upper limit , but with systematic errors not yet included .",
    "( for the proton the expected edm precision is about the same , and is almost 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the current proton upper limit . )",
    "it would not be realistic to claim , at this stage , that all systematic errors at this level of precision have been identified , much less eliminated .",
    "however , even if the @xmath0 precision is overly optimistic for ultimate accuracy , _ high precision is important , since it establishes the precision with which systematic errors can be investigated and ameliorated .",
    "_    the most promising possibility , as regards physics reach , continues to be measuring the edm of the _ proton _ using an all - electric ring .",
    "it is important to reverse the beam circulation direction frequently , with no ring modification ( other than injection direction ) .",
    "this is required for a significant reduction in systematic error . in previous proposals , such as reference@xcite",
    ", the two beams are required to counter - circulate simultaneously , as in a colliding beam ( with `` collisions '' calculated to have negligible effect on the measurement ) . in the present proposal",
    "just one beam circulates at a time , but with frequent circulation reversals .",
    "the justification for dispensing with simultaneous beams is explained in connection with discussion of magnetic shielding , the purpose for which is to suppress the spurious edm signal caused by poorly - known radial magnetic fields .",
    "it has been realized only quite recently that charged hadron particle edm s can be directly measured with accuracy comparable to or , actually , far better than , neutron edm s .",
    "in particular there have been a continuing series of neutron measurements over time , but no direct proton measurements .",
    "the history of neutron edm measurement , up to 1982 , is described ( and very clearly explained ) by ramsey@xcite .",
    "modern neutron edm measurements use the so - called `` ramsey method of separated oscillatory fields '' .",
    "this method is discussed briefly in a later section on magnetic field shielding , needed to reduce a source of systematic error common to neutron and charged particle edm measurement .",
    "the analogy is much closer than magnetic shielding , however , since , like the proposed rolling spin method , the ramsey neutron method can be regarded as shifting the edm sensitivity `` into the frequency domain '' .      at their `` magic '' kinetic energies in an all - electric storage ring , 14.5mev kinetic energy for electrons , 235mev for protons",
    ", the beam polarization precesses at exactly the same rate as the beam momentum .",
    "when viewed at any fixed point in the ring , the polarization appears `` frozen '' , for example always parallel to the beam orbit . by intentionally superimposing a (",
    "precisely - controlled ) torque around the local radial @xmath2-axis , the beam polarization will `` roll '' around that axis at frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the first of the two purposes for the roll is to make resonant polarimetry possible .",
    "a resonant polarimeter responds directly to the longitudinal magnetization of a polarized beam . with beam polarization",
    "frozen forward , the magnetization signal consists of harmonics of the revolution frequency . as such , the magetization signal would compete unfavorably with direct coulomb excitation of the resonator by the beam charge , no matter how carefully the resonator is designed to be insensitive to that excitation .",
    "the rolling polarization alteration ( first introduced by koop , for different reasons , as a `` spin wheel '' ) overcomes this by shifting the magnetization signal frequency far enough away from revolution harmonics for the resonator quality factor @xmath4 to be high enough to suppress the direct resonator response to the passing beam charge .    with ideal stabilization and the magic condition",
    "exactly satisfied , the beam polarization stays always in the local @xmath5 plane where @xmath6 is `` up '' and @xmath7 is longitudinal . in this condition ,",
    "any torque due to the electric bending field acting on the electron edm also lies in the @xmath5 plane and causes a systematic shift in the roll frequency .",
    "_ it is this frequency shift that is to be measured and ascribed to the electron edm .",
    "shifting the edm sensing from polarimeter amplitude to polarimeter phase greatly improves the ultimately - achievable edm precision .",
    "_    both the longitudinal component of beam polarization vector and the roll frequency will be measured using a longitudinally - aligned , resonant polarimeter , sensitive to the longitudinal beam polarization . as discussed in reference@xcite , and in greater detail in a paper under preparation",
    ", this polarimeter responds linearly to the slowly oscillating @xmath7-component of beam magnetization , and is insensitive to both radial @xmath2 and vertical @xmath6 polarization components , as well as being insensitive to beam charge .",
    "( of course the magnetization signal _ is _ proportional to the beam charge .",
    "it is only because the polarized beam charge can be large in a storage ring ( @xmath8 particles , more or less aligned , for example ) that makes resonant polarimetry practical . )    to keep the spin wheel properly aligned will require phase - locked loop stabilization of the other two beam polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "transverse components of beam polarization will be fed back to provide the required stabilizing torques . for protons",
    "this polarimetry can be performed by measuring both the left - right and up - down scattering asymmetries of extracted particles .",
    "alternatively , resonant polarimeters sensitive to transverse components of beam polarization could be used .",
    "such phase - locking has not yet been achieved in practice .",
    "but the jedi collaboration@xcite at the cosy ring in juelich germany , appears to be on the verge of performing this feat .",
    "the proposed storage ring layout is shown in figure  [ fig : singlering ] .",
    "spin wheel , polarimeters , and stabilizers are shown .",
    "feedback to a wien filter holds the roll plane perpendicular to the local radial axis by providing left - right `` steering stabilization '' ( though it is the polarization rather than the orbit that is being steered ) .",
    "this amounts to holding the average beam energy exactly on the magic value .",
    "the design lattice has no intentional solenoids .",
    "however a trim solenoid will be required to cancel possible solenoidal fringe field components .",
    "this solenoid also provides the `` wheel - upright '' stabilization torque .",
    "the stabilizing torques are shown in figure  [ fig : by - out - steer ] .",
    "even if the proton edm measurement is ultimately more promising as `` physics '' , the electron edm measurement is also important . and it is sufficiently similar for electron and proton measurements to be described together in this paper",
    ". also , because the electron magic momentum is so much smaller , the electron ring will be much cheaper .",
    "a sensible first step might therefore be to first build , as a prototype , an all - electric , frozen - spin storage ring for electrons of kinetic energy @xmath9mev ( which is the `` magic energy '' at which the electron spin is `` frozen '' because the `` spin tune '' @xmath10 vanishes ) .",
    "as well as serving as a prototype for an eventual proton ring , such an electric ring could also be used to measure the electron edm with unprecedented precision , and to develop techniques applicable to the proton measurement .",
    "the spins in a beam of deuterons can not be frozen in an all - electric ring ; superimposed electric and magnetic fields are required to cancel the spin tune .",
    "the presence of magnetic bending excludes the possibility of simultaneously counter - circulating beams .",
    "since counter - cirulating beams are not required to be simultaneous for the edm measurement method proposed in the present paper , the same method will be applicable for deuterons , with the only added complication being that reversing the beam circulation direction will require reversing the magnetic fields . nevertheless , for brevity",
    ", the deuteron measurement is not discussed in this paper , except for pursuing a suggestion by senichev@xcite , concerning the possibility of a deuteron ring with disjoint electric and magnetic bend sectors .",
    "this is pursued later in the section titled `` geometric phase errors '' .",
    "i. a. koop@xcite has proposed a `` spin wheel '' in which , by applying a radial magnetic field , the beam polarization rolls in a vertical plane with a frequency in the range from 0.1 to 1 hz .",
    "the rolling polarization i propose is similar , except my proposed roll frequency is greater by a factor as great as one thousand .",
    "as shown in the upper left corner of figure  [ fig : singlering ] , the beam polarization `` rolls '' at uniform rate in the plane defined by the vertical @xmath6 and ( local ) longitudinal @xmath7-axes .",
    "this rolling action causes the longitudinal polarization , which is what the polarimeter senses , to vary sinusoidally with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath3 will be adjustable , to a value such as 100hz .",
    "the ring revolution frequency is @xmath12hz for electrons .",
    "the polarimeter natural frequency will be tuned to one or the other sidebands of harmonic number @xmath13 times the revolution frequency . @xmath14 where the roll can be either `` forward '' or `` backward '' .",
    "the polarimeters have high @xmath15-values , such as @xmath16 and fractional frequency selectivity of about @xmath17 . in theory",
    "the polarimeter is sensitive primarily to beam magnetization and not to beam charge .",
    "however it is anticipated that , if tuned exactly to any harmonic of @xmath18 , excitation due to direct beam charge or beam current would be likely to dominate the polarimeter response .",
    "the rolling of the polarization shifts the polarization response frequency by an amount large compared to the resonator selectivity .",
    "it is also essential for the rolling polarization to not suppress the edm signal .",
    "this is only possible if the bunch polarization stays in a plane normal to the electric field , which is the source of the edm torque .",
    "since the electric field is radial ( @xmath2 ) , the roll plane has to be vertical / longitudinal ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the effect of the edm torque is then to alter the rate of roll .",
    "the instrumentation has to distill this `` foreground '' effect from the `` background '' of intentional ( and unintentional ) sources of roll .",
    "just mentioned at this point , and discussed later in connection with suppressing systematic errors , it can be mentioned that the rolling polarization will also have the beneficial effect of helping torques due to field errors to average to zero over times much less than one second .",
    "the ring is racetrack - shaped with most of the instrumentation in the long straights .",
    "`` wien filters '' are crossed electric and magnetic fields which cause no beam deflection . with no deflection in the laboratory",
    "there is no electric field in the electron rest frame . as a result",
    "these elements apply zero torque to the electron s edm .",
    "the horizontal and vertical wien filter strengths are @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in a wien filter ( stripline terminated by appropriate resistor ) such as @xmath20 , both the electric and magnetic fields are produced by the same current , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 the electric field is produced by the voltage in the precision terminating resistor carrying the current @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining stabilization field is @xmath25 which is the field of a solenoid aligned longitudinally . in all cases , though labelled as if magnetic fields , it is actually the currents through these elements that control the applied torques . as with the wien filters ,",
    "the solenoid strength is established by a single current .",
    "the beam magnetization observed at a fixed point in the ring consists of a `` comb '' of periodic time domain impulses at the beam revolution frequency @xmath18 , but with pulse amplitude varying sinusoidally at the roll frequency .",
    "the frequency domain representation of the magnetization then consists of upper and lower sidebands of the frequency domain comb of all harmonics of the revolution frequency . a resonant polarimeter sensitive to longitudinal polarization and with axis aligned along @xmath7 and tuned to frequency @xmath26 , where @xmath13 is an integer harmonic number , will respond to the upper or lower sideband excitation signal .",
    "even when designed to be insensitive to direct excitation due to beam charge or beam current , a polarimeter tuned to any harmonic of the revolution frequency would likely be overwhelmed by direct coulomb excitation .",
    "the roll frequency therefore has to be high enough , and the quality factor @xmath4 of the resonator large enough , to reject background response due directly to the beam charge or the beam current .",
    "this is what makes the rolling beam polarization essential for the edm measurement .",
    "only upper limits are presently known for the electric dipole moments of fundamental particles .",
    "as regards physics , this is unsatisfactory . as regards describing the apparatus to be used in measuring edm s",
    "it is a nuisance . to simplify discussion",
    "it has become conventional to define a nominal edm value and define @xmath27 to be the edm expressed in units of the nominal edm .",
    "magnetic parameters are given for electrons and protons in table  [ tbl : magneticparams ] .",
    "for an ideal , non - relativistic dirac particle in a uniform magnetic field the momentum precession rate and the spin precession rate are equal  all energies are `` magic '' . for a non - ideal particle with anomalous magnetic moment @xmath28 and magneton value @xmath29 , the difference between these precession rates is the anomalous precession rate @xmath30 . by a numerical coincidence  though the electron s magnetic moment is three orders of magnitude greater than the proton s , its anomalous magnetic moment is three orders of magnitude less  the anomalous precession rates for electron and proton having the same relativistic @xmath31 factor are roughly the same .",
    "the same rough equality holds also with electric bending , with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath33 .",
    "this provides a handy mnemonic when electron and proton edm rings are being contemplated at the same time .",
    "any precession in a storage ring that is due to a particle s edm competes with the anomalous precession due to its mdm , which is roughly the same for electrons and protons . for assessing their relative importance , one can compare the absolute precession due to its edm with the anomalous precession due to its mdm .    .[tbl",
    ": magneticparams]e and p magnetic parameters .",
    "the units are si , but with energies expressed in ev .",
    "anomalous precession rates are in angular units of radians / second . in some cases",
    "the numbers are given to many - many places to indicate the accuracy to which the values are known , _ not _ to indicate the values should be trusted as authoratively correct . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resonant polarimeter theoretical analysis seems solid .",
    "nevertheless , the method has not yet proven out experimentally .",
    "obviously the lack of experimental experience with resonant polarimetry introduces major uncertainty into the design of an experiment for which it is the main component .",
    "one thing is certain though ; the signal level , relying as it does on stern - gerlach force , will be small . both derbenev s and my paper calculate signal to noise ratios , assuming the noise to be dominated by thermal noise at the resonator ambient temperature .",
    "both conclude that high - q , cryogenic , superconducting resonators are needed to bring the signal convincingly out of the noise .",
    "certainly stored polarized beams with as many as @xmath34 particles should give clean resonator output signals .      for the electron edm experiment",
    "the predicted signal level is very safely above the thermal noise level .",
    "this is also true for the proton edm experiment , though less so because of the smaller proton mdm .",
    "this section analyses the influence of the noise on the polarimetry and produces an estimate of the resulting precision limit .",
    "consider a particle circulating in a storage ring magnetic field with rotation frequency @xmath18 . applying the @xmath35 ratio calculated previously ,",
    "the edm - induced precession frequency is @xmath36 . with revolution frequency of @xmath3710mhz ,",
    "this is @xmath38r / s .",
    "0ne has to plan on measuring a `` nominal '' edm - induced precession of order @xmath39r / s , or about 3mr / day .",
    "as a vector angle to be measured this seems pretty small but , as a clock phase angle in a modern , high precision clock , it is not so small .",
    "a virtue of frequency is that its measurement proceeds by counting cycles , or even fractions of cycles ; for example @xmath40 , if one tenth percent of a cycle can be distinguished . here",
    "a cycle is being referred to as a `` fringe '' as that term is applied in optical length measurements .",
    "it will be convenient for data analysis to allow the number of fractional fringes @xmath41 to be non - integer and to interpret @xmath42 as a statistical error parameter ( such as r.m.s .",
    "value ) made in determining @xmath41 .",
    "one can then refer to @xmath41 as the digitised polarimeter phase advance , expressed in units of the statistical error parameter .",
    "modern technology has enabled extremely accurate frequency comparison , for example as described for a commercial device by kramer and klische@xcite .",
    "they use the `` allan variance '' @xmath43 as a quantitative measure of the fractional frequency variance after measuring for time @xmath44 . for the multi - mhz range we are interested in , their apparatus achieves @xmath45 for runs of the duration @xmath44=1000s we are assuming .",
    "they characterize this performance as `` better than 0.2 degrees related to 10 mhz '' , though allan variance @xmath46 is not simply converible into our @xmath42 parameter , this corresponds roughly to @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests our choice of @xmath42=0.001 , for a numerical example , is conservative .",
    "this conservativism reflects our current lack of understanding of the phase noise that limits the achievable precision .",
    "kramer and klische@xcite suggest using coherent detection for further noise reduction . this technique would be made available to us using the coherent responses of multiple polarimeters .",
    "the resonant polarimeter frequency is necessarily quite close to a harmonic of the revolution frequency @xmath18 . in other words",
    "@xmath48 is approximately equal to an integer , such as 10 .",
    "the rate at which fractional edm fringes accrue in the polarimeter is then @xmath49 in a pair of runs , each of duration @xmath44 , the total number of fractional fringe shifts , after time @xmath50 , is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electric dipole moment in units of @xmath53e - cm , and @xmath54 . in this numerical example , with @xmath55 , after 2000s , @xmath52 will have been measured with one unit of statistical precision .    by averaging over some number of runs , @xmath56 , or by performing longer runs one will have measured @xmath52 with higher precision .",
    "exactly how the precision scales with @xmath56 depends on how we interpret the @xmath42 parameter .",
    "the most optimistic assumption possible is that there is no random run - to - run error whatsoever , in which case the precision improves proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "realistically , one expects some random run - to - run error . we can choose to interpret @xmath42 as defining the r.m.s .",
    "run - to - run uncertainty , in which case the precision improves only proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "this is a pessimistic result . even in this case",
    "it will remain necessary to determine @xmath42 phenomenologically .",
    "as has been mentioned already , the dominant contributor to @xmath42 may be irreducible phase noise in the resonant polarimeter .    to properly reduce the ambiguity between optimistic and pessimistic approaches",
    "it would be necessary to replace @xmath42 by two independent statistical parameters . but this will be quite difficult , for example because the split will depend on the run length and other uncertainties . to be conservative",
    "we continue by simply following the pessimistic route . continuing our earlier numerical example , and expecting to make @xmath58 pairs of runs ( over about one year ) one will achieve a one sigma edm precision of @xmath0e - cm .",
    "the dominant fields in an electron storage ring are radial lab frame electric @xmath59 and/or vertical lab magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "they give@xcite transverse electron rest frame field vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and longitudinal electric and magnetic components @xmath63 and @xmath64 , all related by @xmath65      a particle in its rest system , with angular momentum @xmath66 and magnetic dipole moment @xmath67 , in magnetic field @xmath62 , is subject to torque @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath29 is the `` magneton '' value for a particle of that particular mass and charge . by newton s angular equation , substituting from eq .",

    "@xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 as jackson explains@xcite , relativistic effects cause the electron axis to precess in the laboratory , irrespective of any static moments the electron may have .",
    "this thomas precession causes the polarization vector to precess even if there is no torque acting on the magnetic or electric moments .",
    "this precession has to be allowed for when ascribing precession to mdm s or edm s . in our case , the beam direction advances uniformly , by @xmath76 during one revolution period @xmath77 and the thomas precession term is @xmath78 adding this term to the electric part on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton.1 ] ) , @xmath79 this agrees with jackson s eq .  ( 11.170 ) .",
    "we try a solution of the form @xmath80 for circular motion in an electric field , @xmath81 , which leads to @xmath82 accelerator spin physicists define the `` spin tune '' @xmath83 in an electric field by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the angle between spin vector and particle velocity .",
    "the two definitions of `` spin tune '' have therefore been inconsistent . unlike the beam direction , which advances by @xmath76 each turn , and",
    "could therefore be described as having a `` tune '' value of 1 , the spin tune is reckoned relative to the particle velocity rather than relative to a frame fixed in the laboratory .",
    "this accounts for the `` + 1 '' on the rhs of eq .",

    "the achilles heel of storage ring frozen spin edm measurement has , until now , been spurious precession due to any non - zero radial magnetic field average @xmath97 .",
    "acting on each frozen particle s mdm , this magnetic field applies torque that perfectly mimics the edm effect . without rolling polarization ,",
    "the whole determination of systematic error boils down to finding the maximum spurious edm precession that can come from time - dependent variation of @xmath96 .    starting with a discussion of frozen spin operation , much of this section is devoted to showing that rolling polarization largely eliminates this source of systematic edm error .    in the bnl proposed@xcite",
    "proton edm experiment this precession error is limited by precision bpm - measured cancellation of the vertical displacement of simultaneously counter - circulating , exactly superimposed beams . unlike spin precession due to @xmath97 , which is independent of beam direction",
    ", there is a differential displacement of the counter - circulating beams , one up , one down .",
    "cancelling this differential displacement cancels both the spurious mdm - induced precession and the average magnetic fields produced by the two beams , not just on the beam centerline , but also nearby .",
    "using ultra precise squid beam position monitors , located as near as possible to the beam orbits , this method is explained by kawall@xcite .",
    "the produced signals are proportional to the vertical beam separation .",
    "the effectiveness of this approach depends on the coherent summing of field amplitudes in each one of many bpm s , along with the `` null '' beam centering this enables .",
    "according to that proposal , this procedure limits the systematic edm accuracy from this source to about @xmath98e - cm after running for one year .",
    "a goal for the present proposal has been to reach at least the same level of accuracy , but without depending on simultaneously circulating beams .",
    "the rolling polarization method renders this cw / ccw beam reversal less essential .",
    "the new method continues to use counter - circulating beams , but they circulate consecutively , not concurrently .",
    "this produces many of the same cancelations , but lack of simultaneous beams is less effective for two reasons .",
    "one is that the vertical beam displacement is being measured as the small difference of two positions , each of which is being measured using lower precision bpm s ( because of their larger required dynamic range ) .",
    "the other is that , to the extent the magnetic field errors depend on time , their cancelation is impaired by measuring them at separate times .    to be able to claim comparable insensitivity to @xmath96 errors , without depending on simultaneously circulating beams",
    ", we have to overcome this loss of edm selectivity .",
    "a `` selectivity factor , s.f . '' will be used to reduce tedious circumlocution in the following discussion .",
    "small s.f . is good , s.f.=0 is perfect .    for ultimate precision one will , in any case , try to situate the ring away from unpredictable magnetic sources in a city . with active and passive shielding ,",
    "fields of several ft/@xmath99 ( femto - tesla per root hertz ) have been obtained in shielded rooms in city environments . averaged over a 1000s run ,",
    "this gives about @xmath100 t .",
    "it is essentially impossible for this field to be always radial in the storage ring .",
    "averaging over the full ring is likely to give a reduction factor of perhaps 10 .",
    "the magnetic field error is in competition with the `` magnetic equivalent '' of an electric field of roughly @xmath101v / m .",
    "dividing by @xmath102 , this is equivalent to @xmath103 t .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 has to be compared to the relative effectiveness factor @xmath105 . by this estimate",
    "the spurious mdm signal is 10 times greater than the nominal edm signal .",
    "we have been copying , so far , from reference@xcite , assuming the beam polarization to be truly frozen .",
    "this is no longer the case in the present proposal .",
    "now the beam polarization rolls with a frequency of , say , @xmath106hz . even if this frequency were imposed by a control voltage oscillating at frequency @xmath3 , it would produce substantial reduction of the spurious precession caused by @xmath96 .",
    "but any correlation between roll - torque and roll - phase would limit the edm selectivity improvement .",
    "in fact , the polarization roll - frequency is `` autonomously '' self - generated from an applied dc control current @xmath24 .",
    "there is no source for the rolling polarization to be coherent with . as a result the spurious torque due to @xmath96",
    "will truly average to zero over times of order @xmath107=10milliseconds .",
    "furthermore , even if , by chance , there were accidental synchronism at one roll frequency , it would not be present at another .",
    "this rolling polarization improvement has not come without cost . in our proposed method ,",
    "the edm measurement comes from differencing forward and backward roll rates . canceling the effect of external magnetic fields has come at the cost of introducing new possible sources of error via this subtraction .",
    "this will be addressed shortly .",
    "the discussion so far is largely applicable also to time - dependent @xmath108 fields generated inside a shielded room or tunnel .",

    "even hand - held , 1 part in @xmath222 precision is obtained . ]    establishing phase - locked , rolling - polarization electron trap operation will be a tour de force of accelerator technology .",
    "but the task of setting @xmath191 to produce the desired roll frequency @xmath3 to adequately high accuracy is not very challenging , for example because the electron mdm is known to such high accuracy .",
    "the significant challenge in measuring the electron edm to high accuracy will be in guaranteeing that forward and backward roll frequencies ( not counting the small edm effect ) are identical to exquisitely high accuracy .",
    "the basic edm measurement comes from measuring , say , the forward roll frequency ( as a sideband deviation from the revolution frequency ) .",
    "if the mdm - induced roll frequency were perfectly calculable ( which is far from the case ) it could be subtracted off . for @xmath225hz , and nominal edm value of @xmath1e - cm ,",
    "the ratio of imposed roll to edm roll is about 10 orders of magnitude , making an absolute subtraction unthinkable .",
    "on the other hand , both the electron @xmath226-factor and the electron mdm @xmath227 are known to parts in @xmath228 .",
    "the sideband deviation of roll frequency minus revolution frequency can also be measured to high accuracy .",
    "so , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wien.6 ] ) , with all factors accurately known , the @xmath229 product is well known , at least to the extent that the electron edm contribution can be neglected or , more usefully , when the electron edm effect has been arranged to cancel out , irrespective of its magnitude .",
    "the fundamental measurement comes , therefore , from the difference between forward and backward roll frequencies .",
    "this transfers the accuracy requirement to a reversal symmetry requirement .",
    "the reversal symmetry has to be better than 1 part in @xmath8 .",
    "( optimistically , for the proton edm measurement , this may be reduceable to 1 part in @xmath222 . )",
    "the leading task is therefore to minimize the reversal inaccuracy when the @xmath191 wien filter is reversed . by temperature control",
    "the wien dimensions can be controlled to good accuracy . by interferometry",
    "the wien gap width @xmath204 can also be kept quite stable .",
    "the magnetic field nearly on axis can also be measured and held constant to high accuracy .    to be discussed shortly ,",
    "the best measure of the accuracy with which reversal is being done is to readjust @xmath191 and @xmath230 to make the polarization roll in the horizontal , rather than vertical , plane .",
    "this completely suppresses the edm effect . for best accuracy over shortest time interval",
    ", this suggest that sets of 4 runs , forward and backward roll , edm effect present and suppressed , should form the basic data collection block .",
    "interleaving these four configurations repeatedly and in varying order for multiple cycles may produce smallest systematic error .",
    "cw / ccw reversal of beam direction would then be relatively infrequent , perhaps once per day .",
    "other reversals are possible  too complicated for thorough analysis here .",
    "beam rotation can be cw or ccw . since this requires reversing powered end and termination end , it is not as clean as one would wish .",
    "the connections can be switched or , with the apparatus mounted on a turntable , as in neutron edm practice , the wien filter can be switched end - for - end .",
    "rolling the wien filters around their axes represents another way to cancel reversal bias . in combination",
    "these reversals can reduce the reversal error .    reversing the electric field ( as is done in neutron edm measurement )",
    "is clearly impossible .",
    "but , in the electron case , there is the possibility of measuring the positron edm .",
    "the electron - positron edm difference is probably the most accurate lepton measurement possible",
    ".      it will be valuable to be able to measure the accuracy with which the polarization roll reversal can be accomplished , irrespective of how good that accuracy may be .",
    "one can not test the reversal accuracy using an unpolarized beam to suppress the edm contribution  there would be zero resonator response .",
    "one can , however , arrange for the polarization to roll in a horizontal plane .",
    "this would force the edm precession to average to zero , while leaving the resonator unchanged .",
    "any residual asymmetry could only be ascribed to being instrumental .    to achieve stable horizontal polarization roll",
    "will require biasing the @xmath230 wien filter while leaving @xmath191 set for truly frozen spin .",
    "( this will also entail replacing @xmath230 by @xmath191 for wheel stabilization . ) in this case the reversal symmetry can be checked with full digital precision .",
    "this may turn out to be the best way to quantify the reversal symmetry .",
    "much has been made of the important of the isolation of the @xmath191 wien filter .",
    "but , for the reason just given , it will be just as important for @xmath230 to be cleanly isolated from @xmath191 and from the rest of the ring .    irrespective of the absolute accuracy of each single roll reversal",
    ", the overall edm accuracy can be improved by averaging over large numbers of runs with conditions reversed in ways that should cause asymmetries to vanish .",
    "in the proposed ring there will be no intentional longitudinal field components @xmath232 .",
    "but there will be bend field errors @xmath231",
    ". there will therefore have to be at least one longitudinal trim field @xmath233 . the rest frame longitudinal fields to be discussed are then @xmath234 where @xmath231 represents an _ unknown _ longitudinal field component , and @xmath233 is a _ known _ longitudinal trim field .",
    "it is unecessary to introduce a time - dependent magnetic rf term , because the rf electric field does not interact ( on - axis ) with the mdm .",
    "( off - axis there is a time - dependent magnetic field that has be discussed separately , along with other issues such as rf misalignment . )",
    "various non - zero contributions to @xmath235 have also been suppressed , since they give only edm - induced precession small compared to the dominant edm effect .",
    "consider a more or less vertically polarized beam , with rest frame polarization vector @xmath70 given by @xmath236 mdm and edm torques are proportional , respectively , to the cross products @xmath237 the only important torque here is magnetic since the electric rf torque is neglible compared to the bend field torque given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntlo.8 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic torque can , potentially , be large but the leading vertically - directed precession @xmath238 will be cancelled by the trim solenoid .",
    "@xmath239 since both @xmath231 and @xmath112 contribute to unbalancing the equilibrium , though at right angles , they both have to be adjusted empirically .",
    "if the @xmath232 trimming altered @xmath129 it would give an unknown edm effect .",
    "but there is no such coupling .",
    "spurious precession can result from the failure of commutation of successive rotations , proportional to the product of the two precession angles .",
    "the mdm precession angles are themselves so small their squares are negligible .",
    "but the artificially imposed rotation angles are vastly greater .",
    "should a nonzero edm value actually be detected , it might need to be corrected for failure of commutation errors .",
    "but this source of error could not , by itself , produce a statistically significant non - zero edm value of either sign .",
    "any spurious systematic phase shift from this source would include the sign of the artificial roll and would cancel in the subtraction .",
    "geometric phase errors are a significant issue for measuring the deuteron edm .",
    "an ideal frozen spin deuteron ring would have electric and magnetic fields homogeneously superimposed . but segregating the electric and magnet fields into disjoint sectors , as suggested by senichev@xcite , would make the ring construction vastly easier to construct and commission .",
    "it has usually been assumed that segregation into electric and magnetic sectors in this way would be made unacceptable for edm measurement by geometric phase shifts caused by the commutation failure of the quite large mdm - induced precessions in successive sectors .",
    "cancelation on the average of the spurious precessions may allow the method proposed here to be immune from this systematic error .",
    "this section assumes the polarization phase locking described previously has been successful . with the beam polarization locked one can take advantage of the precisely - known electron magnetic moment @xmath227 and anomalous moment @xmath240 as given in table  [ tbl : magneticparams ] . the spin tune",
    "@xmath10 relates to precession around the vertical axis . in an all - electric ring @xmath241",
    "is given in terms of relativistic factor @xmath31 by @xmath242 at the `` magic '' value , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , where @xmath245 solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : emdm.2 ] ) for @xmath31 , ( and requiring @xmath246 ) , @xmath247 we then obtain @xmath248 though this formula is exact , and quite simple , it can usefully be expanded ( to unnecessarily high precision ) to @xmath249 here @xmath10 has been re - expressed in terms of the frequency deviation from magic , @xmath250 , of the polarization around a vertical axis .",
    "this formula is intended for use only near @xmath251 , with the ratio @xmath252 being a tiny number , less than @xmath253 for example .",
    "further terms are easily obtained , but for values of @xmath254 large enough to require them one can simply use eq .",
    "( [ eq : emdm.6 ] ) . with the rf frequency",
    "known to arbitrarily high accuracy and the beam polarization locked to the revolution frequency , measuring the polarimeter response frequency establishes @xmath31 to correspondingly high accuracy .",
    "one is accustomed to expecting a spread of spin tunes due to finite betatron and synchrotron amplitudes and energy deviation of each individual particle from the central beam @xmath31 value . in a certain sense",
    "the beam conditions are better defined than this .",
    "as long as decoherence can be neglected ( i.e. for times short compared to sct ) the net angular precession of each spin vector can not exceed @xmath255 . during this time @xmath244 for every particle on the average .",
    "one sees that phase locking of the polarization establishes the mean beam parameters to exquisitely high accuracy .",
    "of course this remarkable behavior begins to break down for times approaching sct . in effect ,",
    "loss of phase lock and decoherence of the beam polarization are two manifestations of the same spin evolution .",
    "achieving large sct and maintaining the possibility of phase locking the polarization are equivalent tasks .",
    "this analysis has assumed a purely electric lattice . in practice",
    "there will be some average vertical magnetic field component @xmath256 that will cause the @xmath31 value determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : emdm.7 ] ) to be not quite correct .",
    "but it has also been anticipated that keeping the polarimeter loop locked will require a wien filter which compensates for the ( unknown ) total angular deflection @xmath257 by magnetic fields .",
    "the spin tune ascribable to this lattice modification is @xmath258 which compensates for fraction @xmath259 of each turn being caused by magnetic rather than electric field .",
    "the ( well , but not perfectly , known ) strength @xmath24 of the wien filter excitation can be interpreted as a measurement of the angular bend caused by unknown magnetic field component @xmath256 averaged over the ring .",
    "the ultimate claimed @xmath31 precision depends on this correction . in the actual experiment ,",
    "since the roll is around the radial axis , the spin tune will necessarily be exactly zero , meaning the phase locking requires the wien filter to exactly cancel @xmath256 .",
    "one problematical phase - locked loop detail concerns the box labelled `` polarity reversal '' in figure  [ fig : singlering ]",
    ". it would be splendid if the roll reversal could be completed without losing phase lock .",
    "but reversing the roll introduces a discontinuous phase shift in the polarization signal inputs to the resonant polarimeters which will force the circuits to ring down and then ring up again , unlocking the closed loop synchronization .",
    "perhaps the roll drive phase could be judiciously reversed at just the right time to avoid this effect and preserve all phase locking ?",
    "if this could be done then the roll orientation could be reversed at a quite high rate within each fill cycle , greatly reducing systematic frequency shift errors .",
    "if not , then roll reversal may have to be limited to once per fill .",
    "however there is an excellent reason for _ not _ attempting to synchronize any control function with the roll frequency  it would contradict the claim made earlier in the paper that no control sources are synchronous with the roll frequency .",
    "violating this seems sure to cause trouble .",
    "this seems to guarantee loss of phase - lock during roll reversal .",
    "the purpose of the paper has been to describe a method for measuring edm s of electrons and protons with far higher accuracy than they are presently known .",
    "the essential change from earlier proposals comes about from the introduction of resonant polarimetry , which permits phase - locked loop , rolling - polarization trap operation , and shifts the edm signal into the frequency domain .",
    "important contentions , conclusions and conjectures are included in the following long list :    * successful application of the method depends on two not yet established experimental methods : resonant polarimetry ( promising theoretically ) and `` rolling polarization trap '' operation  meaning stable , phase - locked , rolling polarization operation(promising experimentally ) .",
    "* it is thermal noise in the resonant polarimeter that limits edm measurement _ precision_. * a successful single beam fill will include at least one forward / backward reversal of the roll ( not beam ) direction , with roll frequency precisely measured both before and after .",
    "this will produce one _ precise _ edm measurement .",
    "* it is frequency domain , digital , frequency scaling , that enables at least one reversal per fill , giving one precise edm measurement for every roll reversal .",
    "* a successful single beam run will consist of four data sets , edm effect on and off , roll forward and backward .",
    "* cw / ccw beam direction reversal will reduce systematic error . *",
    "expressed as edm upper limit , measurement _ precision _ of @xmath0e - cm after year - long running , for either electrons and protons , can be expected . *",
    "_ accuracy _ at the same level as the _ precision _ will require average sign reversal accuracy of wien filter length / strength product at the level of one part in @xmath260 , also averaged over one year .",
    "lower reversal nulling accuracy will give proportionally lower edm measurement accuracy .",
    "* apparatus constituting a single wien filter will all be contained in a single , temperature regulated , limited vibration , magnetically shielded , highly isolated , etc . box . *",
    "`` rolling polarization trap '' operation greatly improves edm selectivity ( essentially eliminating spurious external field induced precession ) and permits the rest of the ring to have relaxed requirements . *",
    "identical beam distribution requirement for oppositely - directed beams are similarly relaxed by the requirement of precise edm measurement for every fill .",
    "* the greatly reduced sensitivity to unknown radial magnetic field eliminates the need for counter - circulating beams and ultra - low vertical tune @xmath158 .",
    "this , in turn , allows relatively strong alternating gradient ring design , providing larger aperture and higher stored charge .",
    "* emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering ( ibs ) has been seen as a serious impediment to edm measurement . with ultra - low @xmath158",
    "not required , running `` below transition '' , which tends to suppress beam growth due to ibs , will be possible . *",
    "electron cooling has proved ( at juelich ) to be highly effective in increasing sct .",
    "though long sct would improve edm accuracy , electron cooling has previously been rejected out of hand , because of its uncontrolled electric and magnetic field errors it would introduce .",
    "rolling polarization may remove this impediment to the use of electron cooling .",
    "* spin coherence time sct is greatly increased by mbius ring operation .",
    "recapitulating the recapitulation , all of these wonderful edm measurement improvements have been brought about by the phase - locked loop , storage ring polarized - beam trap , made possible by resonant polarimeter .",
    "these advances have not yet been achieved in practice .",
    "the most immediate task is to successfully build and test resonant polarimetry .",
