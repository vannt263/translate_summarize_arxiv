    "trinification  @xcite refers to unified theories based on the gauge group @xmath1 , with gauge coupling equality imposed at a high scale , typically by a discrete symmetry that cyclically permutes the gauge group labels @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the higgs fields responsible for breaking @xmath5 to the standard model gauge group appear in the @xmath6-dimensional representation , @xmath7 the component fields @xmath8 transform as @xmath9 , @xmath10 s under the pair of gauge groups @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively . the theory thus specified has a simple moose representation , shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , with the component fields @xmath8 serving as the ` links ' that connect neighboring gauge group ` sites ' .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of a deconstructed higher - dimensional theory  @xcite , aside from the fact that the link fields in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs27 ] ) do not have the same purpose as in deconstruction , namely , to break chains of replicated gauge groups down to their diagonal subgroup .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of fig .  [ fig2 ] suggests a natural generalization to trinified theories in which the group factors @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are replicated @xmath14 times .",
    "we discuss this generalization in section  [ sec : generalized ] .",
    "these theories also have a simple moose representation , and a gauge spectrum that can be interpreted via deconstruction .",
    "in particular , we will see that the gauge sector of the theory is a four - dimensional analog of the 5d trinified theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which gauge symmetry breaking effects are localized entirely on a boundary .",
    "such 5d theories have interesting properties  @xcite , such as the logarithmic running of the gauge coupling difference @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , and a delay in the scale of unification above @xmath17  gev , the value obtained in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the construction of purely four - dimensional theories with such properties is clearly worthy of pursuit , and has lead to interesting results in the case of su(5 )  @xcite and so(10 )  @xcite unification .",
    "the present work complements this body of literature by introducing a new class of 4d unified theories that are closely related to the deconstruction of 5d trinified guts .",
    "that said , it will not be the purpose of this paper to present a literal deconstruction of the theories discussed in ref .",
    "rather , we proceed from a mostly 4d perspective and develop models that are viable and economical .",
    "for example , in determining the embedding of matter fields in the theory , we do nt follow the prescription of deconstruction at all , so that our 4d theory as a whole can not be mapped to a local 5d theory in the continuum limit .",
    "the higher - dimensional flavor of gauge unification is nonetheless retained leading to a new and interesting class of 4d unified theories .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : generalized ] , we review conventional trinification and define a generalization to @xmath0 replicated su(3 ) groups . in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , we study the gauge boson spectrum of the model , for arbitrary values of the localized symmetry - breaking vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . in section  [ sec : unification ] , we apply these results to study gauge coupling unification in this class of models . in section  [ sec : matter ] , we describe how one may successfully include matter and light higgs fields , so the low - energy particle content is the same as in the mssm . in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our results and suggest directions for future study .",
    "3.3 in    conventional trinified theories  @xcite are based on the gauge group @xmath18 , where @xmath19 indicates a semidirect product .",
    "the @xmath20 symmetry cyclically permutes the gauge group labels @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , ensuring a single unified coupling at the gut scale .",
    "the breaking of @xmath5 to the standard model gauge group requires a higgs field in the @xmath21-dimensional representation , @xmath22 where the numbers shown represent the su(3)@xmath23 , su(3)@xmath24 and su(3)@xmath25 representations , respectively .",
    "at least one such field must develop the vacuum expectation value , @xmath26 the presence of vevs only in the third row assures that su(2)@xmath24 remains unbroken , while nonvanishing @xmath27 and @xmath28 entries leave a single unbroken u(1 ) factor , generated by a linear combination of the diagonal generators of su(3)@xmath24 and su(3)@xmath25 . identifying this with hypercharge @xmath29 , one finds , @xmath30 note that su(3)@xmath31su(3)@xmath25 symmetry allows one to rotate away the vev @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thevevs ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is usually assumed that at least two @xmath6 higgs fields with vacuum expectation values in the desired entries are present in the theory .",

    "one can verify that this construction yields the standard gut - scale prediction for the weak mixing angle @xmath33 .",
    "let us focus on the structure of the gauge and unified - symmetry - breaking sectors of the theory .",
    "a conventional trinified theory can be represented by the moose diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the sake of simplicity we display only a single higgs @xmath6 .",
    "the moose representation makes it clear that the @xmath6 is anomaly - free , which is relevant for the higgs representations since we assume supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath20 symmetry is encoded in the symmetry of the moose under rotations by @xmath34 .    3.3 in",
    "now consider the generalization of this moose to @xmath0 gauge groups , as shown in fig .",
    "each link field transforms as a @xmath35 under consecutive su(3 ) groups , reading around the moose diagram clockwise .",
    "we assume that a generic link has vev @xmath36 where @xmath37 or @xmath4 .",
    "this breaks a chain of su(3 ) factors , namely su(3)@xmath38 for @xmath39 , down to its diagonal subgroup .",
    "the diagonal subgroups are precisely su(3)@xmath40su(3)@xmath31su(3)@xmath25 of conventional ( @xmath41 ) trinified theories .",
    "the three links which are not generic are identified with the links of the @xmath41 theory and have the corresponding expectation values . in particular , the links @xmath42 and @xmath43 have no vevs and serve to truncate a linear moose that contains unbroken su(3)@xmath23 .",
    "if the link @xmath44 also had no vev , we could make an analogous statement for su(3)@xmath24 and su(3)@xmath25 ; we assume , however , that this link has precisely the expectation value necessary to break su(3)@xmath45su(3)@xmath25 down to the electroweak gauge group of the standard model .",
    "thus , the total effect of the link vevs is to break @xmath46 below the scales @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath32 .    at this point , we have said nothing about the values of the @xmath0 gauge couplings . to maintain gauge unification ,",
    "we assume that the theory defined by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is restricted by a @xmath20 symmetry that sets equal three sets of @xmath14 gauge couplings each , @xmath49 thus , we see that the moose in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is also symmetric under rotations by @xmath34 , like the @xmath41 theory .",
    "unification is maintained as in the @xmath41 theory since the couplings of the diagonal subgroups are given by @xmath50 for @xmath37 or @xmath4 .",
    "note that the vev of the @xmath51 link breaks both su(3)@xmath52 and the cyclic symmetry of the moose .",
    "it is important to note that we are agnostic as to whether the @xmath20 symmetry is a symmetry of the full theory , including the fermion representations , or is only an accidental symmetry of the gauge sector .",
    "the latter could be the case if , for example , all of the gauge couplings are equal at a high scale due to the dynamics of a more complete , high - energy theory .",

    "however , @xmath190 transforms as a @xmath6 , where @xmath191 is an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this combination provides for down - type higgs yukawa couplings via higher - dimension operators , suppressed relative to the up - type couplings by a factor of @xmath192 .",

    "the reader can check that the same is true in the charged lepton sector as well .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 s of matter fields contain exotic particle content that becomes heavy in minimal trinified theories due to the su(3)@xmath204-breaking vevs of the @xmath53-@xmath171 link .",
    "the same happens here , though there is some suppression due to the delocalization of the matter multiplets .",

    "note that the exotic fields in the @xmath21 form complete su(5 ) multiplets  @xcite , so they can appear below the unification scale without substantially altering the conclusions of section  [ sec : unification ] .    while the previous model can accommodate the flavor structure of the standard model , it is not clear whether successful models can be constructed for larger @xmath14 .",
    "the assumption of the unbroken @xmath20 symmetry would force different generations to be widely separated if the number of sites is large .",

    "equivalently , we may assume that the @xmath20 symmetry is an accidental symmetry of the gauge and higgs sector , but not of the matter fields .",
    "then we may place all three generations on a single set of gauge sites , namely , @xmath208-@xmath53-@xmath171 , for some @xmath61 . in this case , no suppression factors appear in the yukawa couplings , and the origin of the fermion mass hierarchy is completely decoupled from the physics of unification .",
    "while we keep the arrangement of higgs fields the same , we can add an additional three pairs of @xmath209 and @xmath210 spectator fields at each new gauge site ; in this way , all spectators will acquire gut - scale masses by coupling in pairs via an intermediate link field .",
    "for either the @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4-sector spectators , these interactions have the form @xmath211 using this construction , we can study models with many more gauge sites .",
    "the only limitation on the size of @xmath14 comes from the assumption that the su(3 ) gauge couplings @xmath212 remain perturbative . for the case of identical gauge couplings ,",
    "@xmath212 is related to the gauge coupling of the diagonal subgroup , @xmath213 , by @xmath214 using our earlier renormalization group analysis , one finds numerically that the constraint @xmath215 translates to @xmath216",
    "we have considered a natural generalization of trinification to theories with @xmath0 gauge groups .",
    "we have showed that the gauge and higgs sector of the theory can be interpreted as a deconstructed version of a 5d trinified theory with unified symmetry broken at a boundary ; we have studied the gauge spectrum in the deconstructed theory for arbitrary boundary higgs vevs . as in the 5d theory ,",
    "the differences in inverse gauge couplings evolve logarithmically , and one finds successful unification at a scale higher than in the 4d mssm .",
    "since the unification scale grows as @xmath217 , unification may be delayed to @xmath218  gev before the gauge coupling of the replicated su(3 ) factors becomes nonperturbative .",
    "this might be compared to the result in the 5d theory , @xmath219  gev , which is the point at which the 5d planck scale and the unification scale coincide  @xcite .",
    "we have also considered ways in which the light matter and higgs content of the mssm could be embedded in the ( rather large ) unified group .",
    "we first showed how doublet - triplet splitting could be arranged , via fine tuning , leaving light higgs doublets localized between two gauge sites in the original moose .",
    "the point here is not to solve the doublet - triplet splitting problem , but to present a viable zeroth - order framework in which such questions can be studied . with all symmetry breaking localized",
    ", we then considered the embedding of matter fields . assuming first that the unified boundary condition on the gauge couplings arises from a @xmath20 symmetry that rotates the moose by @xmath34 , one obtains symmetrical embeddings of the fermion multiplets within the moose ( _ c.f .",
    "_ , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "although these have no strict extra - dimensional interpretation , we have , roughly speaking , delocalized the fermion multiplets while keeping all the symmetry - breaking and light higgs fields at one point .",
    "we show for relatively small moose , one can arrange for sufficient overlaps via higher - dimension operators involving the link fields to account for fermion masses and inter - generational mixing . for larger",
    "moose , we assume instead that the unified boundary condition on the gauge couplings is simply present ( or alternately , the @xmath20 symmetry is an accidental symmetry of only the gauge and higgs sectors ) so that matter can be embedded asymmetrically .",
    "then the overlap between matter fields and light higgs fields can be made maximal and no restriction follows on the size of the moose .",
    "alternatively , such models provide the freedom to adjust matter - matter and matter - higgs overlaps in a way that can account in part for the flavor hierarchies of the standard model .",
    "this is one advantage of the models introduced here over minimal trinified scenarios .    aside from demonstrating how one may deconstruct the 5d trinified theory described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have arrived at at class of 4d theories that are interesting in their own right .",
    "this is not a surprise , as the same is true of deconstructed 5d theories based on su(5 ) symmetry that have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the present work therefore provides a new framework for future study of a range of familiar issues , including the implementation of solutions to the doublet - triplet splitting problem , proton decay phenomenology , the origin of flavor via combined unified and horizontal symmetries , construction of explicit symmetry breaking sectors , _",
    "etc_. models based on the idea of nonsupersymmetric triplicated trinification  @xcite may also be worthy of study in this context .",
