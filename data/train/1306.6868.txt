    "the fe chalcogenide compounds , such as fe@xmath20se , fe@xmath20se@xmath21te@xmath22 , or the _ _ a__@xmath21fe@xmath23se@xmath15 ( _ a _ = tl , rb or k ) display remarkable superconducting properties . for example , the tetragonal phase of fe@xmath20se ( i.e. when @xmath24 displays superconductivity at @xmath25 k only when @xmath26 @xcite , although it was recently shown that intercalation with li@xmath21(nh@xmath15)@xmath27(nh@xmath0)@xmath28 or k leads to a dramatic enhancement in @xmath18 up to 43 k @xcite and 44 k @xcite , respectively . for the fe@xmath20se@xmath21te@xmath22 series , recent angle resolved photoemission studies suggest a ratio for the superconducting gap to the fermi energy @xmath29 placing this system at the bcs to bec crossover , or equivalently , that these are very strongly coupled superconductors @xcite . finally",
    "a__@xmath21fe@xmath23se@xmath15 is claimed to be close to an orbital - dependent mott transition @xcite indicating a certain resemblance with the cuprates , although several studies support the microscopic coexistence of superconductivity with magnetism and concomitant insulating states @xcite .",
    "recently , we reported the discovery of yet a new transition - metal based anisotropic multi - band superconductor , i.e. nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 , which displays extremely large upper critical fields @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the fe chalcogenides , this compound crystallizes in the lower symmetry space - group @xmath31 which , according to band structure calculations , leads to a complex fermi surface ( fs ) composed of both two - dimensional ( 2d ) and quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) sheets .",
    "the pd stoichiometry is predicted to play a major role since the calculations indicate that it displaces the fermi - level favoring nesting among the q1d fs - sheets for particular wave - vectors , and this would lead to electronic instabilities and possibly to itinerant magnetism @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pd fraction is expected to play a role similar to that of f or co and k in the  1111 \" and  122 \" fe - arsenides respectively , @xcite where variations in their stoichiometry is observed to induce superconductivity or increase the superconducting transition temperature in detriment of antiferromagnetism .",
    "given its composition and electronic anisotropy , one could expect nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 to display physical similarities with transition - metal dichalcogenides such as 2@xmath32-nbs@xmath15 or 1@xmath33-tas@xmath15 , or some of the transition metal trichalcogenides as nbse@xmath0 .",
    "the former two compounds display a charge - density wave ( cdw ) transition followed by superconductivity at lower temperatures @xcite . while the latter displays two transitions towards cdw - phases upon cooling @xcite .",
    "however , we did not detect any sharp anomaly that could indicate a transition akin to a peierls instability in nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 , hence we have no evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity with a density - wave like state which is claimed to enhance the superconducting upper - critical fields ( @xmath19 ) in the aforementioned compounds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , and despite the similar values of @xmath18 , nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 displays remarkably larger @xmath19s ( by a factor of two or more depending on orientation ) when compared to either nbs@xmath15 @xcite or nbse@xmath15 @xcite and , in contrast to both compounds , it also displays a clear concave down curvature in @xmath34 for @xmath35-axis .",
    "these observations , indicate few similarities between nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 and the dichalcogenide or trichalcogenide compounds .",
    "in addition , as we will see below , the properties of the metallic state of new compounds emerging from nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 by replacing s with se are non - fermi liquid like in the region of temperatures just above @xmath18 in contrast to the aforementioned compounds .",
    "this behavior is very prominent in a very narrow range of values for the fraction @xmath3 of pd , or when @xmath36 , where one observes the emergence of superconductivity from the non - superconducting compounds .    in this manuscript",
    ", we show that new families of compounds can be created by varying the chemistry of nb@xmath15pd@xmath30s@xmath16 , leading to new superconducting compounds such as nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 and nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 .",
    "it turns out , as shown below , that nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 for @xmath37 displays a crossover from metallic @xmath38 to  non - metallic \" @xmath39 upon cooling , therefore we show that superconductivity in this compound emerges from an anomalous metallic state upon cooling .",
    "this crossover like temperature is observed to decrease as @xmath18 increases ( upon variation of @xmath3 ) , with the metallic state displaying non - fermi liquid behavior as a function of the temperature , i.e. @xmath40 with @xmath41 ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . in contrast , the nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 compound , with a middle point superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 k , do display fermi - liquid like metallic behavior ( or @xmath44 above 150 k. nevertheless a mild anomaly centered around 110 k is observed in the resistivity , suggesting also a crossover or perhaps an electronic instability .",
    "although in this compound @xmath18 increases with _ x _ or the pd content , the position of this anomaly remains unaffected by it .",
    "similarly to the nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 compounds , superconductivity in the nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 series also emerges from a state displaying  non - metallic \" character ( or @xmath45 ) .    for these new chalcogenides , low dimensionality , multi - band effects , anomalous metallic behavior , and as will be discussed below for the case of nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 , anisotropic and extremely high upper critical fields , suggest an unconventional superconducting state . here , we focus on the superconducting phase - diagram of nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 .",
    "a detailed account on the dependence of the superconducting phase - diagrams of nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 and nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 on @xmath3 or the pd content , will be given elsewhere .",
    "nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 was grown via a solid state reaction under an ar atmosphere : nb ( 99.99 % ) , pd ( 99.99 % ) , and se ( 99.999 % ) well mixed powders in the ratio of 4:1:10 were heated to a peak temperature of 850 @xmath46c at a rate of 100 @xmath46c / h in sealed quartz ampoules , kept for 48 hours and subsequently quenched to room temperature .",
    "the obtained single crystals formed thin long needles several millimeters in length , but with cross - sectional areas ranging from @xmath47 @xmath48m@xmath49 up to @xmath50 @xmath48m@xmath49 .",
    "the stoichiometric composition was determined by energy dispersive _ x_-ray",
    "spectroscopy and single - crystal _ x_-ray structure refinement .",
    "two distinct crystallographic phases were identified as resulting from the growth conditions , namely nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 and nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 , with @xmath51 showing superconducting transition temperatures @xmath18 ranging from @xmath52 k up to @xmath53 and @xmath54 k , respectively .",
    "the detailed results of our refinements , including the respective atomic positions for typical single - crystals of each phase is given in appendix a. a conventional four terminal configuration was used for the resistivity measurements which were performed under magnetic - field either by using a physical parameter measurements system ( also for heat capacity measurements ) or a superconducting magnet coupled to a dilution refrigerator .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) to ( d ) shows the resistivity @xmath55 normalized by its value at room temperature , i.e. @xmath56 as a function of the temperature ( in a logarithmic scale ) for five single - crystals resulting from the same synthesis process .",
    "these crystals were analyzed through single - crystal @xmath57-ray diffraction measurements to reveal both their composition and their crystallographic structure .",
    "traces in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) were obtained from crystals belonging to the nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 phase , whose pd content @xmath3 was refined as @xmath58 ( blue trace ) , @xmath59 ( green trace ) , and @xmath60 ( grey trace ) , respectively .",
    "the room temperature resistivity of these crystals was found to oscillate between several tenths of @xmath61 cm to a few hundreds of @xmath61 cm .",
    "this variability in the actual values of the resistivity can be attributed to the error bars in the determination of their geometrical factors , particularly their thickness which , for example , is approximately 1 @xmath48 m for the superconducting single - crystal shown in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) . as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , a broad anomaly is observed in the resistivity around @xmath62 k , indicating either an electronic phase - transition akin to a spin - density wave state seen in the fe - pnictide superconductors @xcite or a crossover towards a new electronic regime , such as the pseudogap observed in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "notice also that just above the superconducting transition @xmath55 displays an uncharacteristic @xmath33-dependence for a metal , i.e. with a negative @xmath63 , indicating the existence of a prominent quasiparticle scattering mechanism .",
    "red lines are fits to the power law @xmath64 which yields exponents @xmath41 ranging from 3.7 for the non - superconducting sample , to 2 for the superconducting one , thus suggesting that the superconducting sample displays fermi - liquid behavior already at high temperatures .",
    "the higher exponents for the non - superconducting samples result from the pronounced upturn in the resistivity observed around 110 k. the overall behavior seen in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) , i.e. a pronounced change in slope at higher temperatures followed by an uncharacteristic  non - metallic \" like behavior at lower temperatures , is remarkably similar to what is seen in the underdoped regime of , for example ,",
    "la@xmath65sr@xmath21cuo@xmath66 @xcite , although the resistivity in those compounds follows a linear dependence on temperature at higher temperatures .    figures 1 ( c ) and ( d ) show @xmath56 for two nb@xmath15pd@xmath1se@xmath16 single crystals , i.e. respectively for @xmath67 and @xmath68 resulting from the same synthesis process .",
    "notice the pronounced but progressive increase in resistivity below @xmath69 k for the @xmath67 sample , suggesting again a continuous or second - order like electronic phase - transition or perhaps a crossover towards a pseudogap - like regime .",
    "therefore , for _ both _ compounds @xmath70 defines a threshold concentration separating superconducting from non - superconducting samples .",
    "remarkably , while the increase in @xmath3 beyond 0.7 induces superconductivity in nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 it is observed to _ suppress _ superconductivity in nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that superconductivity is stabilized by small displacements of the fermi level , or equivalently that in both compounds the fermi level is located in close proximity to a van hove singularity . for the nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 compounds , we found that the exponent in the power law describing @xmath55 at high temperatures ( 150 k @xmath71 300 k ) evolves from a value close to 1 when @xmath72 , to @xmath73 in the superconducting samples ( or when @xmath74 ) which corresponds to non - fermi liquid behavior , and can not be easily ascribed to scattering by phonons .",
    "furthermore , the superconducting transition for nb@xmath15pd@xmath75se@xmath16 is preceded by an upturn in the resistivity starting at @xmath76 k. therefore , for both compounds and for @xmath77 superconductivity condenses out of an unconventional metallic state .    as discussed below as well as in ref .",
    ", the geometry of the fs of these compounds is complex and contains quasi - one - dimensional sheets which are the necessary ingredient for a peierls - like instability which could lead to itinerant magnetism .",
    "the broad anomaly seen around 110 k in nb@xmath0pd@xmath10s@xmath2 single - crystals could correspond to evidence for such a transition and therefore in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) we show the magnetic susceptibility @xmath78 as a function of the temperature for a batch containing hundreds of randomly oriented single - crystals .",
    "we used hundreds of crystals , given that a typical individual single - crystal , whose data are shown above , weights only @xmath79 @xmath48 g .",
    "we found that this particular batch is composed almost exclusively of crystals belonging to the nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 phase .",
    "as seen , at higher temperatures @xmath80 varies little showing an unexpected linear dependence in temperature which could be an indication for pauli - like susceptibility , but with a temperature - dependent density of states at the fermi level . around 110",
    "k one observes just a mild deviation from linearity as indicated by the arrow , hence it does not represent a clear evidence for an electronic or magnetic phase - transition . for @xmath81",
    "k , @xmath80 displays a sharp upturn which , as seen in the inset , does not correspond to a curie tail : the inset plots the inverse of @xmath80 in a limited temperature , i.e. for @xmath82 k , and as seen it is not linear in temperature .",
    "consequently , this upturn can not be attributed to the presence of impurities and most likely corresponds to evidence for magnetic correlations .",
    "a fit to a power law yields a very small exponent suggesting a @xmath83 divergence .",
    "2 ( b ) , on the other hand , shows the electronic contribution to the heat capacity @xmath84 normalized by the temperature @xmath33 , after the subtraction of a @xmath85 term and for two values of the field , respectively @xmath86 and 9 t. again , hundreds of single - crystals from one synthesis batch ( @xmath87 mg ) , therefore of varying stoichiometry , were used for these measurements .",
    "a broad anomaly in @xmath88 emerges below @xmath89 k and peaks at @xmath90 k , with its width determined by the distribution of @xmath18s , as seen in the upper panel .",
    "this anomaly is suppressed by the application of an external magnetic - field , as expected for bulk superconductivity .",
    "therefore , our observations clearly indicate bulk superconductivity .",
    "we emphasize that the data shown in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to crystals displaying among the highest @xmath18s within the batches synthesized by us .",
    "in contrast , the heat capacity yields an average value for @xmath18 .",
    "nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 crystallizes in the space group @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and can be described as composed of sheets of a single nb@xmath91pdse@xmath92 basic unit which is comprised of chains formed by square - planar and trigonal - prismatic se polyhedra which are approximately centered by pd and nb atoms , respectively ( see ref . ) .",
    "each chain extends along the [ 010 ] direction ( needle axis ) .",
    "the pd(1 ) atoms center a column of face - to - face square planes .",
    "both nb(1 ) and nb(2 ) atoms occupy chains of edge - sharing trigonal prisms while the nb(3 ) atoms occupy columns of face sharing trigonal prisms .",
    "the basic nb@xmath91pdse@xmath92 is formed in such a way that the polyhedra in adjacent columns share their edges .",
    "the nb@xmath91pdse@xmath92 layers form via interdigitation of the nb@xmath91pdse@xmath92 units , with the nb(3 ) atoms acquiring a seven - coordinate , monocapped trigonal - prismatic environment .",
    "the three - dimensional structure results from the stacking of these layers in a closed packed ( se atoms ) fashion .",
    "the pd(2 ) atom occupies a rhombic site between the layers and is square - planar coordinated with the se(1 ) atoms .",
    "given the low crystallographic symmetry of nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 one expects an anisotropic response for magnetic fields applied along its distinct crystallographic axis .",
    "therefore , we show the resistivity of a second nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 single - crystal ( @xmath93 k ) for several temperatures and as a function of the magnetic - field @xmath32 applied along the @xmath8 and the @xmath94axis ( figs . 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) , respectively ) and for fields along the @xmath7 or the needle - axis ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) .",
    "this crystal was placed onto a sapphire substrate and the external field was initially applied perpendicularly to @xmath95plane ( fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) .",
    "subsequently , the field was rotated by 90@xmath96 with respect to this previous orientation , while remaining perpendicular to needle - axis ( fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ) .",
    "subsequently , it was rotated by 90@xmath46 around the @xmath94axis in order to align the field along the @xmath7axis ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) .",
    "as seen , the resistive transitions from the superconducting to the metallic state for the different field orientations reveal rather anisotropic upper - critical fields @xmath19 .",
    "in figure 5 , we display the resulting @xmath19 - @xmath33 phase - diagram , constructed by plotting the middle point of the resistive transitions shown in fig .",

    "below we also show a fit of @xmath119 to the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg formalism @xcite , indicating that a large @xmath117 value of @xmath120 would fit the boundary , but would require a large spin - orbit coupling implying that this coupling is relevant for this system . finally , as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 , the superconducting anisotropy @xmath121 is @xmath33-dependent as seen in the fe pnictides / chalcogenides and interpreted as evidence for multi - band effects @xcite .    in order to evaluate the contributions of both orbital and pauli pair - breaking effects for all field orientations",
    "we analyze our @xmath122 data at temperatures close to @xmath18 where the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory yields @xcite : @xmath123 very close to the critical temperature , @xmath124 , the first paramagnetic term in the left hand side is negligible and eq .",

    ", such large values for the paramagnetic limiting field relative to @xmath18 would be difficult to understand for a conventional superconductor , suggesting either very strong correlations renormalizing @xmath14 as seen in the heavy - fermions , or an unconventional pairing mechanism , or both .",
    "notice that these values for @xmath117 are @xmath118 the value required for the observation of the fflo - state @xcite . for the other two orientations ,",
    "one obtains similar values for both @xmath14 and @xmath133 .",

    "red line is a fit to the werthamer , helfand , and hohenberg formalism @xcite with a tentative value of the maki parameter @xmath136 which yields a extremely large value for the spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath137 .",
    "although it remains unclear how reliable such a large value is , this suggests that the spin - orbit coupling plays a relevant role for this system .    to shed some light about the possible superconducting pairing mechanism in nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath16",

    "the complex 3d network itself ( golden ) seen in fig . 7 ( e ) , contains both hole - and electron - like orbits .",
    "therefore , given that the resulting fs is composed of multiple sheets , having both electron- and hole - character , this system can indeed be classified as a multi - band superconductor .",
    "spin - polarized calculations show that a ferromagnetic state is stable , with a small moment attributable to some nb atoms (  0.27 @xmath140/nb(1 ) ,  0.20 @xmath140/nb(2 ) ) and a polarized , delocalized interstitial density .",

    "in summary , nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 is a new chalcogenide based multi - band superconductor , displaying extremely large upper critical - fields , i.e. comparable to those of unconventional strongly correlated heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "the synthesis process also yields crystals of the nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 phase which also displays superconductivity .",
    "both compounds display an anomalous metallic behavior , particularly for temperatures above their respective superconducting transitions which bears resemblances with the pseudogap phase of the cuprates .",
    "such anomalous metallic behavior was not observed in nb@xmath16pd@xmath30s@xmath16 which displays a considerably higher superconducting transition temperature @xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates that the fraction @xmath3 of pd plays the role of a dopant , i.e. by varying its content one can , for instance , suppress non - metallic states and stabilize superconductivity as observed in the nb@xmath15pd@xmath21se@xmath16 series . notice that this study was confined to a narrow range in @xmath3 , from @xmath141 to @xmath142 where we have shown",
    "that small variations in @xmath3 or @xmath143 easily suppress superconductivity in both families of compounds .",
    "therefore , the overall behavior reported here for the nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 series is clearly characteristic of an underdoped regime . as we already implied within the introduction , an anomalous metallic behavior with broad anomalies which can not be clearly attributed to phase - transitions and which instead suggest crossovers towards new electronic regimes , makes these compounds particularly distinct from the dichalcogenides or the trichalcogenides .",
    "notice , that in quasi - one - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional systems such as these , both charge - density waves @xcite coupling to lattice distortions , and spin - density waves @xcite resulting from electronic correlations lead to sharp , first - order like anomalies in their physical properties such as the resistivity @xcite , in contrast to what is seen here .",
    "in fact , it would seem that these compounds are more akin to the fe chalcogenide superconductors : for example in the fe@xmath100se@xmath21te@xmath22 series the resistivity in the metallic state is known to display a @xmath144 dependence above the superconducting transition which can be suppressed upon careful annealing @xcite .    a complex fermi surface composed also of quasi - one - dimensional sheets , interplay of superconductivity with an anomalous metallic state , extremely high upper critical fields coupled to multi - band behavior , suggest an unconventional pairing symmetry .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of superconductivity in nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 with a @xmath3-dependent superconducting transition - temperature as high as @xmath4 k for @xmath5 ( middle point of the resistive transition ) . </S>",
    "<S> needle - like single crystals display anisotropic upper - critical fields with an anisotropy @xmath6 as large as 6 between fields applied along their needle axis ( or @xmath7axis ) or along the @xmath8axis . as for the fe based superconductors </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is temperature - dependent suggesting that nb@xmath0pd@xmath10se@xmath2 is a multi - band superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by band structure calculations which reveal a fermi surface composed of quasi - one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional sheets of hole character , as well as three - dimensional sheets of both hole- and electron - character . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , @xmath11 is observed to saturate at @xmath12 t which is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pauli - limiting field in the weak - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis procedure yields additional crystals belonging to the nb@xmath15pd@xmath1se@xmath16 phase which also becomes superconducting when the fraction of pd is varied . for both phases we find that superconductivity condenses out of an anomalous metallic state , i.e. displaying @xmath17 above @xmath18 similarly to what is observed in the pseudogap - phase of the underdoped cuprates </S>",
    "<S> . an anomalous metallic state , low - dimensionality , multi - band character , extremely high and anisotropic @xmath19s , are all ingredients for unconventional superconductivity . </S>"
