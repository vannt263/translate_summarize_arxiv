    "differential measurement of azimuthal ( @xmath3 ) correlation functions for charged hadrons is arguably one of the most important experimental probes for high energy - density nuclear matter created at the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the anisotropy as well as the asymmetry of such correlation functions are predicted to ; ( i )  serve as a  barometer \" for collective transverse flow and hence a probe for the equation of state ( eos )  @xcite , ( ii )  provide important constraints for the density and effective energy loss of partons  @xcite , and ( iii )  provide invaluable information on nuclear saturation scales  @xcite .",
    "full exploitation of these correlation functions require a good understanding of the mechanistic origin of two - particle azimuthal correlations at rhic energies .",
    "detailed systematic measurements of such correlations constitute important steps in this endeavor .",
    "the colliding au beams ( @xmath0  gev ) used in these measurements have been provided by the rhic . charged particles from mimum - bias",
    "triggered events were detected in the fully instrumented east and west central arms of phenix  @xcite .",
    "each of these arms subtends 90@xmath4 in azimuth @xmath5 , and @xmath6 units of pseudo - rapidity @xmath7 . the axial magnetic field of phenix ( 0.5 t ) allowed for the tracking of particles with @xmath8 gev / c ( @xmath9 ) in the fiducial volume of both arms .",
    "good track quality was ensured via matching and veto cuts to outer detectors in each arm .",
    "the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) , were used in conjunction with the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) , to provide off - line selections of a wide range of centralities expressed as a fraction of the total interaction cross section .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlation functions were constructed via the ratio of two distributions  @xcite ; @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the observed @xmath3 distribution for charged particle pairs selected from the same event , and @xmath12 is the @xmath3 distribution for particle pairs selected from mixed events .",
    "mixed events were obtained by randomly selecting each member of a particle pair from different events having similar centrality and vertex position .",
    "two correlation functions were obtained for each @xmath13-range of interest . in the first , charged hadron pairs were formed by selecting both particles from a reference range , which excludes the @xmath13 range of interest ( i.e. a reference correlation  @xcite ) . in the second",
    ", hadron pairs were formed by selecting one member from the @xmath13 range of interest , and the other from the reference range @xmath14 ( i.e. an assorted-@xmath13 correlation  @xcite ) .    -.75 cm    -.75 cm    -.75 cm figure  [ fig : cor_fun ] shows representative differential assorted-@xmath13 correlation functions for an event centrality cut of 20 - 40% .",
    "the hadron pairs were formed by selecting one member from the range gev / c and the other from a non - overlapping reference range @xmath14 . an additional requirement that particle pairs detected in the same phenix arm have the same charge ( + + or -- ) was also imposed to reduce [ but not exclude ] non - flow correlations .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cor_fun ] indicates an essentially symmetric correlation function for gev / c .",
    "by contrast the correlation function for gev / c ( left panel ) shows an asymmetry at small @xmath3 .",
    "this asymmetry grows if narrow pseudo - rapidity cuts ( @xmath15 ) are imposed or if particle pairs are required to have dissimilar charge ( + - ) .",
    "these trends are compatible with the effects of jet fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy and asymmetry of the generated correlation functions have been characterized via fits .",
    "a good representation of the data for the reference-@xmath13 and the assorted-@xmath13 correlation functions is obtained with the fit functions @xmath16 @xmath17 respectively . here the gaussian term and the @xmath18 term is used to characterize the asymmetry [ at small @xmath19 and the anisotropy respectively .",
    "the anisotropy parameter for the @xmath13 range of interest @xmath20 , is given by @xmath20 = @xmath21/@xmath22 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the anisotropies extracted from the assorted and the reference correlations respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath20 can be compared to the second fourier coefficient @xmath23 , commonly used to quantify the anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "differential values of @xmath20 ( hereafter referred to as @xmath23 ) are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : pt_dep ] and [ fig : cent_dep ] .",
    "-.75 cm    -.75 cm    -.75 cm figure  [ fig : pt_dep ] shows differential anisotropies @xmath1 , which increase with @xmath13 followed by an apparent saturation for @xmath24  2.5 gev / c .",
    "this trend is similar for all centralities shown and is without doubt related to the collision dynamics .",
    "hydrodynamic models  @xcite provide a good description of the data for @xmath13 up to @xmath25 gev / c .",
    "however , these models do not predict the observed saturation of @xmath1 ( see inset ) .",
    "the lack of saturation indicates that the model assumption that local equilibrium can be maintained until a sudden freeze - out hypersurface is reached , is invalid outside some finite domain of phase space .",
    "results obtained from the jet dominated model hijing , also show poor agreement with the data at high @xmath13 .",
    "models incorporating only strong jet quenching  @xcite or jet quenching acting in concert with hydrodynamic expansion  @xcite do not provide a good description of the high-@xmath13 data as well .",
    "by contrast , results from a recent implementation of a covariant transport theory  @xcite gives a good representation of the data if either extremely high initial gluon density or very large parton - parton scattering cross sections are employed in the calculations ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_dep ] ) . results from a saturation model  @xcite can also account for the observed anisotropies ( see left panel and inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : pt_dep ] ) .",
    "the mechanistic origin of two - particle correlations in the transport and saturation models are very different .",
    "consequently , additional constraints are required to facilitate a distinction between them .",
    "one such constraint is the centrality dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "the saturation model predicts that @xmath23 should scale as @xmath26  @xcite , where @xmath27 represents the number of participants in the collision . for large opacities ( high initial gluon density or very large parton - parton scattering cross sections )",
    "one expects the transport model to exhibit essentially @xmath27 scaling .",
    "-.75 cm    fig .",
    "[ fig : cent_dep ] show initial tests for @xmath26 scaling ( right panel ) , and @xmath27 scaling ( left panel ) for charged hadrons of @xmath28 gev / c .",
    "the data indicates better overall agreement with @xmath27 scaling for the centrality range presented but does not exclude @xmath26 for relatively central collisions .    -1.0",
    "in summary , two - particle correlation measurements indicate sizeable anisotropies and asymmetries . the trend of the asymmetries are compatible with the asymmetric emission pattern of mini - jets .",
    "the anisotropy ( @xmath23 ) increases with decreasing centrality and increases with @xmath13 up to @xmath29 gev / c . for higher @xmath13",
    "s the anisotropy saturates for each centrality cut .",
    "this important feature is not reproduced by hydrodynamic models but is well reproduced by the covariant transport theory of molnar _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , and the saturation model of kovchegov _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "more detailed measurements of the centrality dependence of @xmath23 may allow one to distinguish between the two very different mechanisms for two - particle correlations , implied by the latter models ."
