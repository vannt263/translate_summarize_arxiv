    "constraining galaxy evolution through measuring changes in the star formation rate density at even higher redshifts is a viable and important goal .",
    "however , a deep understanding of galaxy evolution , from the era of galaxy formation until now , requires an accurate foundation that is based on observations of the most recent epochs .",
    "the current conflict over the strength of the evolutionary trend can be addressed by carrying out a uniformly sensitive survey for star formation in hundreds of galaxies at each of several epochs .",
    "the _ wyoming survey for h@xmath0 _ , or wysh , is a large - area , uniform survey for star - forming galaxies at several different epochs that span the latter half of the age of the universe  surveys of gallego et al . (",

    "the specific aim of the survey is to utilize narrowband imaging of -emitting galaxies to conclusively determine the strength of the evolution in the cosmic star formation rate density since @xmath17 , to provide a firm , low redshift baseline for studies of star - forming sources at higher redshift .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce the survey , in particular the optical imaging program , and to present initial results from the two most recent epochs studied .",
    "though only preliminary results are presented in this contribution , the survey will ultimately cover volumes at each epoch large enough to minimize cosmic variance due to large scale structure and to robustly quantify any dependencies on environment .",

    ", the data are being uniformly obtained over the same fields and to the same sensitivity to luminosity over the different epochs .",
    "the survey is being carried out over 3.5 - 4 square degrees from multiple `` blank '' fields selected to minimize foreground contamination ( see   [ sec : field_selection ] ) . by design ,",
    "these fields are additionally pre - selected to overlap with the target areas of deep infrared and ultraviolet surveys . not only will this survey provide a statistically robust measure of the evolving star formation history of the universe",
    ", it will also enable important parallel science to be pursued .",
    "for example , combining , ultraviolet , and infrared data will help us to understand the extent to which the standard individual star formation rate indicators are biased ( wilson et al .",
    "2002 ) , and to study the evolution of ultraviolet and optical extinction by interstellar dust over time ( e.g. , reddy et al . 2006 ; burgarella et al . 2007 ; iglesias - pramo et al . 2007 ; moore et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , a large volume , multi - epoch survey will sample well the cluster , group , and field environments , leading to strong constraints on the environmental threshold that provides the balance between star formation inducement and truncation that occurs in the vicinity of clusters ( e.g. , dale et al . 2001 ; balogh et al .",
    "2002 ; finn et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "astronomers rely on a wide range of observational approaches for quantifying star formation .",
    "the ultraviolet , infrared , and radio restframe continua all provide useful measures of the star formation rate , as do line fluxes in the ultraviolet , optical , infrared , and sub / millimeter ( kennicutt 1998 ; calzetti et al . 2007 ; kennicutt et al .",
    ". however , for local universe systems  photons , indicative of ionized gaseous regions and hence directly related to the massive stellar population , provide the conventional standard by which to gauge star formation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "is typically the intrinsically strongest optical emission line and it suffers less extinction than other traditional indicators that lie at shorter wavelengths .",
    "moreover ,  fluxes are technically much simpler to obtain than star formation measures at longer wavelengths .",
    "thus a feasible and direct route to measuring galaxy evolution , one that is well - calibrated by local universe measurements and is accessible from a 2  m class ground - based telescope equipped with a wide - field camera , would be to survey the universe in  at several different epochs .",
    "in addition to carrying out  observations over multiple epochs , we are observing multiple fields ( table  [ tab : fields ] ; figures  [ fig : wysh1]-[fig : elaisn1 ] ) .",
    "three separate fields help to dampen the effects of cosmic variance ( davis & huchra 1982 ; oliver et al .",
    "2000 ; huang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , the spacing of the fields in right ascension and their high declinations enable year - round observations from jelm mountain , located at a terrestrial latitude of + 41  and an elevation of 9656  feet ( 2943  m ) above sea level , thus maximizing the number of usable nights .",
    "these fields have been chosen to minimize foreground contamination by zodiacal and galactic dust , bright stars , and nearby galaxies .",
    "our pointings in the elais - n1 and lockman hole fields overlap with deep surveys that have been carried out in the infrared and ultraviolet .",
    "the swire spitzer legacy project provides maps of these regions at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , 70 , and 160  ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) , while the galex deep imaging survey offers 30  ks integrations in these regions at 1528 and 2271 , integrations that are much deeper than the canonical 0.1  ks integration per pointing of the galex all - sky survey ( martin et al .",
    "our third field , dubbed wysh  1 , conveniently fills the right ascension gap between the lockman hole and elais - n1 , at a northern declination not covered by any other current deep field work .",
    "optical observations for the survey utilize the wiro 2.3  m telescope .",
    "wiro is equipped with a 2048x2048 ccd camera at prime focus that has 0523 pixels and hence a 179 field of view ( pierce & nations 2002 ) .",
    "while most narrowband imaging surveys rely on broadband imaging for the estimation of the continuum flux levels , we use wavelength - adjacent narrowband filters ( @xmath22  fwhm ) to optimize the continuum subtraction . note",
    "that this approach leads to a more efficient observing program , since no time is `` wasted '' on obtaining broadband imaging .",
    "the filter transmission profiles for the optical portion of this survey are provided in figures  [ fig : filters1 ] & [ fig : filters2 ] .",
    "the filter widths and central wavelengths in table  [ tab : filters ] are computed via ( ) d| where @xmath23 reflects the combined transmittance of the filter and the quantum efficiency of the ccd , normalized to peak at unity ( see pascual , gallego , & zamorano 2007 ) .",
    "note that these values are for the typical observing temperature of 0  c.    the basic unit of observation is a 300  s frame , though several are taken for each filter at each location ; the individual 300  s frames are slightly dithered to improve image reconstruction .",
    "iraf / ccdproc is used to run the images through the standard preliminary data processing routines .",
    "bias levels and dark counts are removed , the images are trimmed to their usable regions ( 2048x2037 pixels ) , and the images are flat - fielded using twilight sky flats .",
    "fringing affects our images primarily at wavelengths of 8132  and longer , and all images suffer from non - uniform illumination that induce a mild halo effect if not removed .",
    "the amplitude of fringing is at the 10% level or smaller in terms of sky fluctuation , whereas the non - uniform illumination results in 1 - 2% variations in the sky level across the field .",
    "ccdproc is also used to correct for both of these effects , relying on the science frames themselves for fringe removal and on median skyflat images for the non - uniform illumination .",
    "the data presented here were obtained under generally good observing conditions during several observing runs spanning 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 .",
    "the seeing at jelm mountain is typically 15 fwhm ; the observed stellar psfs from 300  s frames range from 12 - 20 for this survey .",
    "flux calibration is obtained via 30  s observations of spectrophotometric standards ( bohlin , dickinson , & calzetti 2001 ) .",
    "based on numerous repeated measurements of the same set of standard stars , the uncertainty in the flux calibration is 5% .",
    "in addition to frequently monitoring the night sky conditions by eye , the photometric quality for each frame is based on the relative fluxes in five foreground stars distributed across the field of view .",
    "ninety percent of the 300  s frames used in this presentation were obtained under photometric conditions ( in which foreground stellar fluxes agree to within 2 - 3% from frame to frame ) . for the remaining 10% of the frames taken in ` nearly photometric ' conditions , the median flux correction to account for thin cirrus cloud cover is a factor of 1.07 .",
    "such a correction is applied to each image in conjunction with a correction to convert all fluxes to their equivalent values for zero airmass .",
    "the multiple 300  s frames for a given field are aligned and stacked to create images with longer effective integrations ( table  [ tab : filters ] ) .",
    "the ` stack ' is an average frame constructed from iraf / imcombine with avsigclip rejection and a weighting applied to each image that is based on the photometric quality described above .",
    "coordinate solutions are written to each stack header via iraf / xyeq and iraf / ccmap , based on the coordinate solutions in digitized sky survey imaging and the pixel coordinates for several matched field stars in dss and wysh frames .",
    "inspection of numerous sources spread across the fields of view of several stacks shows that wysh coordinates match dss coordinates to within an arcsecond .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey is estimated in two ways , with the first based on the fluctuation of sky counts and the second based on the observed distribution of detections ( the identification of sources is described in   [",
    "sec : sextractor ] ) . in the first method , assuming a 3  diameter aperture and using the observed 3@xmath5 sky fluctuations of @xmath24 and @xmath25  w  m@xmath26 at 7597/7661  and 8132/8199 , respectively , we find that the 3@xmath5 limiting sensitivity to continuum / continuum+line luminosity in our survey is @xmath27  w.    the noise characteristics within a fixed circular aperture does not necessarily capture the full sense of the survey sensitivity .",
    "the seeing psf is of course not constant from night to night , nor do we even utilize fixed aperture photometry for our source extraction (   [ sec : sextractor ] )",
    ". figure  [ fig : distribution ] shows the relevant figure for the second method of estimating survey sensitivity . in this figure",
    "we show the observed distribution of signal - to - noise and luminosity for all narrowband detections at the targeted redshifts .",
    "as can be seen from the distribution , the 3@xmath5 sensitivity to luminosity is @xmath28  w. in short , the two techniques give consistent values for the survey sensitivity to continuum / continuum+line luminosity .",
    "the sensitivity to line detections is @xmath29 poorer since we derive line strengths via subtraction of two narrowband luminosities , as described in the following section .",
    "sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) is used to identify sources and to extract their fluxes .",
    "extensive simulations were performed to optimize the extraction approach for our imaging program ; key parameter settings include detect_thresh=1.5 and detect_minarea=3 0523 pixels .",
    "the flux_auto output parameter ( with the default phot_autoparams=[2.5,3.5 ] ) is used for the flux extractions , as it effectively recovers simulated fluxes for the variety of source morphologies and sizes typical of this survey .",
    "narrowband filter pairs are employed at each epoch , and it is unknown in advance whether a particular source will produce line emission appearing in ` filter a ' or ` filter b ' of a given filter pair .",
    "thus , sextractor is used in ` dual ' mode twice for each stack .",
    "first , sources are identified and fluxes are extracted from the filter a stack , then sextractor is rerun on the filter b stack using the same positions and apertures that were determined from filter a imaging .",
    "the procedure is then repeated in the reverse order : identifications and extractions are based on filter b imaging , and then the filter a image is processed using filter b positions and apertures . in this way two goals are accomplished : fluxes are consistently extracted from filter a and filter b imaging , and line emitters with weak continuum levels are not overlooked .",
    "traditionally , narrowband imaging surveys rely on broadboand imaging to infer and subtract off the underlying stellar continuum .",
    "since two wavelength - adjacent but otherwise nearly identical narrowband filters are used at each epoch for this survey , the line emission is derived from a simple subtraction of the flux from filter a and the flux from filter b ( after accounting for the slightly different filter widths ) : @xmath30 ) & = & f_{\\rm a } - f_{\\rm b}{\\delta_{\\rm a } \\over \\delta_{\\rm b } } \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm if } \\;\\;\\ ; f_{\\rm a } >",

    "the above expressions include the luminosity distance @xmath31 and filter fluxes derived as the filter width times the flux density , e.g. , @xmath32 . while our dual - narrowband imaging is more accurate than a traditional narrowband+broadband observational approach , there still may be a selection effect working against low equivalent width sources .",
    "hanish et al . (",
    "2006 ) show that 4.5% of their  luminosity density comes from galaxies with equivalent widths smaller than 10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] displays the  equivalent width distributions for the two epochs studied in this work , showing that a significant portion of our sources have equivalent widths below 10 .",
    "the distributions are qualitatively in agreement with that presented in the literature ( e.g. , gronwall et al .",
    "2004 ; haines et al . 2007 ) , though there is evidence for larger equivalent widths at redshift @xmath18 than at @xmath2 .",
    "the median equivalent widths are 8.5  and 23  at redshifts 0.16 and 0.24 , respectively .",
    "the redshift of each line emitter is not known _ a priori _ and thus detections from galaxies outside of the target epochs could bias to high levels the  detection rate and thus the inferred star formation rate density at each epoch ; other prominent optical emission lines such as @xmath334959/5007 , @xmath343727 , and @xmath344861 could be redshifted into the filter bandpasses ( e.g. , fujita et al .",
    "photometric redshifts are used to cull the contaminators .",
    "multiple photometric redshift catalogs are or soon will be available for the fields pursued in this work : rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from swire , csabai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from sdss , and moore et al .",
    "( in preparation ) from wiro observations .",
    "the swire survey utilizes a suite of optical and infrared fluxes along with a variety of spiral , elliptical , and agn sed templates to determine photometric redshifts .",
    "the sloan survey uses a similar technique with @xmath35 data , and our wiro - based catalog employs @xmath36 imaging in addition to our narrowband data . in regions where the coverage overlaps ( e.g. , lockman hole ) ,",
    "we have compared the impact of using photometric redshifts from the various surveys .",
    "survey products such as the parameters and integrals of the  luminosity functions are fairly insensitive to which survey is utilized for photometric redshifts ( moore et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "however , for the sake of uniformity swire photometric redshifts are used where available , with sdss and our own photometric redshifts employed to supplement the swire coverage .",
    "the uncertainty on these photometric redshifts is a function of redshift , flux , the number and rest wavelengths of the broadband detections , the sed models , etc .",
    "the typical photometric redshift used in this work has an uncertainty of @xmath375% .",
    "a source is considered to be at one of the targeted redshifts if its photometric redshift falls within one of our filter s effective bandpasses , i.e. , within @xmath38/2 of one our filter s central wavelengths ( see   [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "the sample of  emitters is created after applying a 3@xmath5 cut based on the  signal - to - noise .",
    "the large number of sources detected in our survey leads to a robust _ statistical _ representation of the star formation rate at each cosmic epoch , but the reliance on photometric redshifts implies a certain level of error in tagging _",
    "individual _ sources as residing within the targeted redshift ranges .",
    "the impact of relying on photometric redshifts will be more fully explored in a future contribution that presents a larger fraction of the survey .",
    "a primary tool for understanding the basic characteristics of a galaxy population is the luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "the  luminosity function is constructed for each epoch assuming a schechter profile : ( z , l ) dl = ( z , l ) dl = _ * ( z ) ( l l_*(z ) ) ^(z ) e^-l / l*(z ) dl l_*(z ) , where @xmath39 conveys the shape of the function , @xmath40 sets the luminosity scale , and @xmath41 represents the overall normalization .",
    "the computation of the @xmath42 bin of the luminosity function and its uncertainty follows ( z , l_i ) = _ j v(z_j , l_j)^-1 l , = l [ eq : lf ] where @xmath43 is the comoving volume for the @xmath44 galaxy in the summation , @xmath45 , and the bin width @xmath46 spans 0.4  dex .",
    "the  luminosity functions for each epoch are presented and discussed after a brief description below of corrections that are first applied to the data .",
    "if each filter bandpass were to follow a ` tophat ' profile , then the comoving volume computed in equation  [ eq : lf ] would be simply a product of the filter width @xmath38 and the number of square degrees surveyed ( see table  [ tab : filters ] ) .",
    "however , since the filter bandpasses are not tophats , it is more difficult to detect faint galaxies over the full bandpass . hence , the volume in equation  [ eq : lf ] for faint galaxies is somewhat smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "the volume correction factors , @xmath47 , where v(z , l)_cor = ( z)_filter v(z , l ) , can be as large as 10 - 20% , but the median volume correction factors are @xmath48=0.985 , 0.981 , 0.990 , and 0.988 , respectively for filters centered at 7597 , 7661 , 8132 , and 8199 .",
    "a second effect is related to the non - rectangular nature of the filter bandpass profiles .",
    "if spectra were available to provide accurate measures of individual galaxy redshifts , then each  luminosity could be corrected by the inverse of the normalized filter transmission at the appropriate wavelength , @xmath49 . since such spectra",
    "are not available for this survey , galaxies that are detected in the low - transmission wings of the filter profiles are measured to have artificially faint  luminosities .",
    "a statistical correction , @xmath50 , can be applied to all  luminosities to remedy this effect .",
    "the correction is derived by calculating the average inverse normalized transmission for each filter , weighted by the survey s distribution of detectable  luminosities ( assuming a schechter luminosity function ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the effect indicate @xmath51 .",
    "fluxes are corrected for foreground milky way extinction , an effect on the order of 1% for these regions of low galactic cirrus emission .",
    "more importantly , the  data are also corrected for the internal extinction within the survey galaxies .",
    "a standard recipe is to assume 1 magnitude of extinction at either @xmath52 band ( a factor of @xmath372.1 at 6563 ) or at the  wavelength ( a factor of @xmath372.5 at 6563 ) .",
    "another approach is to employ an extinction that varies with galaxy luminosity .",

    "( 1989 ) reddening curve is assumed ( see ly et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this approach is adopted for the wysh survey .",
    "table  [ tab : corrections ] lists the extinction correction factor , @xmath57 , for the relevant bins in the luminosity function .",

    "the uncertainty in the star formation rate , @xmath59(sfr ) , includes factors of 2% , 15% , 5% , and 20% to account for uncertainties in the filter widths , the correction for  ( equation  [ eq : ha ] ) , the flux calibration , and the correction factors described in this section , respectively .      an important correction accounts for the increasingly limited ability to detect sources with fainter  luminosities .",
    "an incompleteness correction , @xmath60 , is derived for each bin of the luminosity function , for each epoch observed , ( z , l)_cor = ( z , l)_inc^-1 ( z , l)_obs extensive monte carlo simulations are employed to quantify the impact of incompleteness . for each luminosity bin in the luminosity function , iraf / mkobjects is used to create several mock images with the same noise as the actual survey image stacks described in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "these mock images incorporate typical seeing effects and generate sources with distributions similar to those of actual sources in spatial density , equivalent widths ,  diameters ( dale et al .",
    "1999 ) , and of course the luminosity of the particular luminosity bin being simulated .",
    "table  [ tab : corrections ] provides a compilation of incompleteness factors @xmath61 for samples that are selected with a 3@xmath5 cut based on the  signal - to - noise .",
    "the uncertainties in the incompleteness are based on the ranges in incompleteness for a variety of simulation parameters ( e.g , 500 vs. 1500 vs 4500 sources in a simulated image ; @xmath62ew@xmath63 vs @xmath64ew@xmath65 , etc ) . for brighter luminosities the incompleteness reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath66 due to the effects of sources overlapping one another .",
    "additional pseudo - empirical simulations , whereby artificial sources are added to actual image stacks , indicate consistent results with the ` pure ' simulations .",
    "a main goal of this survey is to derive the volume - averaged star formation rate at several epochs , @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath67 is to be interpreted as being solely due to star - forming galaxies , then contributions from agn galaxies will have to be removed .",

    "however , these same studies estimate between @xmath371 and 11% of the cosmic star formation rate stems from galaxies lacking obvious optical line emission .",
    "these two effects have a counteracting impact on @xmath67 , and in light of their uncertainties and relatively small impact on the final outcome , we do not invoke any corrections to account for them .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfs ] shows the initial luminosity functions at @xmath2 and 0.24 for the wysh survey .",
    "open circles indicate the data corrected for all issues described above except incompleteness ; the filled circles also include corrections for incompleteness .",

    "tentatively , we observe a significantly higher luminosity function amplitude @xmath71 at @xmath18 than at @xmath2 .",
    "it is difficult to compare the characteristic luminosity @xmath72 between the two epochs since it is poorly defined at @xmath2 .",

    "the volume - averaged cosmic star formation rate can be computed by integrating under the fitted schechter function and multiplying by the kennicutt ( 1998 ) star formation rate calibration : _ sfr ( h_70 m_^-1 mpc^-3)= 7.910 ^ -35 ( w ) where an analytical expression for the luminosity density is = _ 0^ dl l ( l ) = _ l_(+2 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath71 and brighter @xmath72 at @xmath18 lead to an overall larger cosmic star formation rate density at that redshift , by a factor of 1.5 for the canonical fits displayed in figure  [ fig : lfs ] .",

    "our aim is to achieve relatively small statistical uncertainties by executing a luminosity - uniform survey for hundreds of galaxies at each epoch using narrowband filter pairs for improved continuum subtraction .",
    "preliminary results from approximately 2 square degrees from two fields indicate a clear evolution in the volume - averaged cosmic star formation rate , a decrease by a factor of @xmath371.5 from a redshift of @xmath18 to a redshift of @xmath370.16 .",
