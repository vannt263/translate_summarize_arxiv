    "the unit cell , crystallographic axes , and orientation were checked by x - ray and found in agreement with those reported earlier by others .      in order to check the level of paramagnetic impurities",

    "<S> we present nmr measurements of a strong - leg spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder compound @xmath0 under magnetic fields up to 15 t in the temperature range from @xmath1 k down to 50 mk . from the splitting of nmr lines we determine the phase boundary and the order parameter of the low - temperature ( 3-dimensional ) long - range - ordered phase . in the tomonaga - luttinger regime above the ordered phase , </S>",
    "<S> nmr relaxation reflects characteristic power - law decay of spin correlation functions as @xmath2 , which allows us to determine the interaction parameter @xmath3 as a function of field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that field - dependent @xmath3 varies within the @xmath4 range which signifies attractive interaction between the spinless fermions in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) provides a universal description of gapless quantum systems of interacting particles in one dimension ( 1d ) , irrespective of the underlying microscopic hamiltonian @xcite . within the tll framework , </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy properties are completely characterized by only two parameters , the renormalized velocity of excitations @xmath5 and the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the exponents of all correlation functions , which follow power laws , have simple expressions in terms of @xmath3 only . </S>",
    "<S> this concept has been successfully applied to a wide variety of systems @xcite , e.g. organic conductors @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , quantum wires @xcite , edge states of fractional quantum hall liquid @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , and antiferromagnetic ( af ) quantum spin systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted original properties , such as power - law correlations or fractionalization of the excitations , have been well demonstrated by experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it remains a very difficult task to relate the universal tll parameters to the microscopic model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum spin systems appear to be a rather unique exception in that respect : their microscopic interactions are often simple and well - defined such that @xmath5 and @xmath3 can actually be calculated and directly compared with experiments , which enables quantitative tests of the tll theory @xcite . among others , spin-1/2 heisenberg af </S>",
    "<S> ladder systems , having exchange interactions @xmath6 along the legs and @xmath7 along the rungs , have proven particularly useful under a magnetic field @xcite . in zero- or low - field , strong quantum fluctuations in a ladder </S>",
    "<S> prohibit any magnetic order but lead to a collective singlet ground - state , often called a spin liquid , that is protected by a finite gap to the lowest triplet excitations . </S>",
    "<S> application of a magnetic field @xmath8 lowers one triplet level by zeeman energy and eventually closes the gap for the field larger than a critical one , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap closing is accompanied by a transition into a gapless phase that survives up to a saturation field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this gapless phase can be described as a tll of spinless fermions with the help of direct mapping of the spin ladder hamiltonian onto a model of interacting spinless fermions @xcite . a remarkable feature arising from this mapping concerns the role of the applied field in controlling the tll physics : @xmath8 , now acting like a chemical potential , controls the filling of a fermion band and determines , together with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the interaction ( @xmath3 ) between the fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin ladder in a strong - rung coupling regime ( @xmath11 ) have been successfully explored in @xmath12 ( bpcb ) @xcite which indeed has offered a unique opportunity to test the tll theory quantitatively over the whole band fillings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the ladders are known to provide an interesting contrast for the associated tlls according to the coupling regime @xcite : the theory predicts _ attractive _ spinless fermions ( or attractive spinon excitations ) , i.e. @xmath13 , for the ladder in _ strong - leg _ coupling regime , while repulsive interactions ( @xmath14 ) characterize the strong - rung regime as in bpcb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction for the attractive interactions , however , could not have been confirmed for more than a decade @xcite , mainly due to the absence of a suitable strong - leg ladder material with low - enough energy scales accessible by available magnetic fields .        </S>",
    "<S> the recent success @xcite in synthesis of @xmath0 , called dimpy , appears promising in that regard , since this material features a ladder structure of spin-1/2 cu@xmath15 ions coupled via isotropic exchanges , @xmath16 k and @xmath17 k , through cu@xmath18br@xmath18br@xmath18cu bonds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic one - dimensionality @xcite and a small magnon gap of 4.2 k @xcite were confirmed by neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> no magnetic transition was observed down to 150 mk in zero field while the field - induced transition into the tll phase at @xmath19 t was revealed by specific heat measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations , combined with the thermodynamic measurements and neutron scattering results , predicted @xmath20 t @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation was indeed observed around a similar value of 31 t at 1.6 k in preliminary pulsed - field magnetization measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , field - dependent thermodynamic anomalies in specific - heat and magneto - caloric effects were found and attributed to magnetic transition into a low - temperature long - range ordered phase due to weak inter - ladder coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is expected to belong to the 3d xy universality class and the ordered phase ( canted xy antiferromagnet ) can be described as magnon bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , though a direct evidence for the order parameter has not yet been found . </S>",
    "<S> the available experimental results , supported by theoretical calculations @xcite , highlight dimpy as an ideal strong - leg ladder compound in which one can hope for probing attractive interactions in the tll phase @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present the nmr investigation of dimpy providing the first direct evidence for a tll with _ attractive _ interactions . we first identify the order parameter below the magnetic transition temprature @xmath21 through nmr line splitting , and map out the ordered - phase boundary as a function @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> then we evidence power - law spin correlations in the tll phase defined above @xmath21 via the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath22 , measurements as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> they allow us to extract the sign and field - dependent strength of the interaction between the spinless fermions .    for these experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we used a single crystal with approximate dimensions @xmath23 mm@xmath24 and mass 2.5 mg , which has been grown from solution with the temperature gradient method described in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the monoclinic crystalline structure ( space group @xmath25 ) and quality of the crystal was confirmed by x - ray and neutron scattering @xcite , and a trace of paramagnetic impurities were found to be negligible , of the order of 0.1 % ( see the supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a unit cell contains two different ladders running along the @xmath26 axis with different rung vectors @xcite and each ladder is assigned with two inequivalent n sites ( see the supplemental material @xcite for the structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath27n and @xmath28h nmr were used in complementary manner : simple and well resolved @xmath27n spectra ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) arising from only four inequivalent n sites in a unit cell allow us to accurately track the line splitting with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> precise temperature - dependence of @xmath22 was obtained mainly by @xmath28h nmr , to take advantage from its strong signal intensity due to the large gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that @xmath27n and @xmath28h results are consistent in both spectrum and @xmath30 data as described later .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1]a shows typical @xmath27n nmr spectra above and below the transition at @xmath31 mk in 15 t. the magnetic field was applied along the direction 14@xmath32 off from @xmath26 axis of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of orientation ensures that all the @xmath27n nmr lines are well resolved and separated from one another , so that the line splitting expected from internal fields could be clearly visible . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a each line of the high temperature spectrum splits into two at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> half of the lines are visibly split , while for the others we simply observed a broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting is symmetrical and the split lines have both the shape ( gaussian ) and the width identical to the corresponding high - temperature line . </S>",
    "<S> this observation points to the development of simple staggered internal fields that should be transverse to the applied field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the line splitting is thus directly proportional to the size of the transverse ordered moments .    </S>",
    "<S> we monitored the temperature dependence of the splitting of the lowest - frequency line in the spectrum ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) in various magnetic fields , which is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> the data nicely illustrate development of the order parameter upon lowering the temperature . for each field , the onset of the splitting defines @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting increases rapidly with decreasing temperature and eventually saturates toward 22 khz around 150 mk . we tried to fit the data to a power - law @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the splitting and @xmath35 the critical exponent . as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , the best global fitting for the @xmath36 range gives @xmath37 which indeed agrees with the theoretical value of 0.35 for the 3d xy universality class @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath27n nmr spectrum data provide the first direct ( microscopic ) evidence for the order parameter in dimpy .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary , @xmath38 , of the ordered phase is drawn in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . the low field ( @xmath39 t ) </S>",
    "<S> part of the phase diagram , where @xmath27n signal becomes too weak , was completed by monitoring the evolution of @xmath28h spectrum as a function of temperature or field . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency was checked at 3.5 t where both @xmath28h and @xmath27n spectra lead to the same @xmath21 value . by extrapolating @xmath38 toward zero , we estimate @xmath40 t. solid line represents a critical scaling @xmath41 for a dilute magnon 3d bec @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath38 data agree with and extend those obtained from the thermodynamic anomalies reported previously @xcite ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus confirm that those anomalies indeed indicate the magnetic transition into a long - range ordered phase , likely a magnon bec .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn our attention to the spin dynamics in the tll phase above @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> as regards the low - energy excitations , a spin-1/2 ladder can be mapped onto a model of interacting spinless fermions , which , after linearization around the fermi points and bosonization , transform into the tll hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as remarked before , @xmath3 in this hamiltonian measures both the sign and the strength of the interaction and determines the power - law exponents of correlation functions . by nmr @xmath22 measurements we probe local spin - spin correlations of the electrons in the low - energy limit . for the spin ladders , in both strong - rung and strong - leg regimes , the transverse correlation functions at @xmath42 are dominant which leads to @xmath2 @xcite . as the field approaches @xmath43 ( or @xmath10 as well ) </S>",
    "<S> , the tll should approach a non - interacting regime where @xmath44 and thus @xmath45 . independently , a scaling argument for 1d quantum critical regime also leads to @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a continuous variation of @xmath46 is established from the tll to the 1d quantum critical regime .    </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig2]a - d show @xmath22 of @xmath28h as a function of temperature obtained in four representative magnetic fields , 3.5 , 5.0 , 12.0 , and 15.0 t , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27n @xmath22 data in 15.0 t are also presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d to confirm the consistency . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law behavior , @xmath47 , is evident for certain temperature ranges above @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> upon lowering temperature close to @xmath21 , thermal critical fluctuations become dominant and enhance @xmath22 beyond the tll behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we find the critical fluctuations become negligible above @xmath48 , so that we take this value as the lower bound for the validity of the given power - law behavior defining @xmath49 or @xmath50 . on the high temperature side </S>",
    "<S> , the tll regime is connected to the classical paramagnetic regime through a crossover . </S>",
    "<S> we find that power - law behavior is sustained up to above @xmath51 at least . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the power - law exponents @xmath52 were extracted from the fits to the data systematically in the equivalent temperature range @xmath53 at all field values .    to emphasize the universal @xmath22 behavior , we present in fig . [ fig2]e the @xmath22 data in a scaled form , that is , by plotting @xmath54 normalized to 1 within the fitting range as a function of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the data for @xmath56 , and well beyond @xmath51 when available , collapse on a flat line confirming a power - law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath52 is plotted as a function of field in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath52 in the range @xmath57 , which corresponds to the attractive interaction , i.e. @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath52 clearly converges toward @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath44 , as the field approaches @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the system approaches the non - interacting regime and/or 1d quantum critical regime , as expected from theory . </S>",
    "<S> these nmr relaxation data provide the first direct evidence for power - law correlations in dimpy and , more generally , attractive interactions in a spin - ladder tll .     as a function of applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> solid line represents the dmrg calculations reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath3 values can be read from the scale on the right axis , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we find a quantitative difference between the experimental results and the dmrg calculations reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data yield much larger @xmath3 values than the calculated ones . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this difference is not clear at the moment . in principle , larger @xmath59 than estimated could lead to larger @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility might be that the residue of thermal critical fluctuations contribute to @xmath22 up to higher temperatures than @xmath48 assumed here , due to their quasi-1d magnetic character . </S>",
    "<S> we compared our @xmath22 data with the available model of purely 1d ladders with the dominant transverse fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as one approaches @xmath21 from above , deviation from this simple picture should arise as soon as the inter - ladder correlations become relevant . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations can probably be treated in mean - field approximation taking into account the full 1d fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> they are further followed by a crossover regime before reaching the critical one in the vicinity of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to take into account these additional theoretical considerations and calculate @xmath22 accordingly , to compare with the experimental data as well as to set up the upper bound in temperature for this model . </S>",
    "<S> however , these calculations are not available yet and are beyond the scope of the present work . on the experimental side , </S>",
    "<S> further measurements using different techniques would help to resolve the issue . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering is another candidate to measure similar properties .    to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here are the first direct evidence for tll with attractive interactions realized in condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> most 1d physical realizations such as carbon nanotubes and others are known to support repulsive interactions @xcite . for af quantum spin systems , </S>",
    "<S> calculations show that a few models , e.g. spin-1/2 xy ladder or xxz chain with ferromagnetic anisotropy , should support attractive interactions @xcite , but their experimental realization must be quite challenging . </S>",
    "<S> heisenberg spin-1/2 ladders thus appear particularly interesting as they present both repulsive and attractive regimes according to the @xmath59 value where the crossover takes place across @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath22 results now establish this rather unique case of attractive regime for @xmath61 . furthermore , the magnetic field driven variation of @xmath3 corresponds to the tuning of tll model parameters by external means , akin to quantum simulation @xcite . indeed , the spin ladders and other gapped 1d spin systems @xcite increasingly prove their utility under a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> they host and allow manipulation of quantum phases and many - body phenomena not only at qualitative but also at quantitative level @xcite , which might be otherwise difficult or impossible to realize .    to summarize , our nmr @xmath22 results of the ideal strong - leg spin-@xmath62 ladder compound dimpy under a magnetic field provide the first evidence for a tll with attractive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath3 is shown to vary between 1 and 2 as a function of field which indicates the field - controlled strength of the attractive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the nmr line splitting at low temperature evidences the order parameter in dimpy for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the ordered phase is likely a canted xy antiferromagnet that can be described as the bec of magnons .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank t. giamarchi for discussions and p. bouillot for sharing the dmrg data . </S>",
