    "[ def : stringcgroups ]    it is important to remark that a string c - group @xmath18 always involves a pair consisting of a group @xmath5 and a set @xmath20 of distinguished generators .",
    "if we refer simply to @xmath5 as a string c - group , then it is implied that either a set @xmath20 of distinguished generators for @xmath5 has been specified or that we can find a suitable set @xmath20 of generating involutions that satisfies the intersection condition .",
    "the definition of a string c - group stemmed from the extension of the concept of a regular polytope from classical geometry to an _",

    "the book _ abstract regular polytopes _  @xcite by p. mcmullen and e. schulte offers a comprehensive account of the theory of abstract polytopes and string c - groups including history and recent developments in the subject .    as with most specialized groups , no known general method exists for checking if a given group is a string c - group .",
    "consequently , most papers that deal with characterizations or classifications of string c - groups consider particular types of groups or families of groups that satisfy certain qualifications or possess interesting properties .",
    "these include , for instance , simple and almost simple groups  @xcite , symmetric and alternating groups  @xcite , discrete groups of transformations  @xcite , groups of a fixed rank  @xcite , and small groups  @xcite .",

    "the library is accessible through the link http://www.abstract - polytopes.com / atlas/. the use of computational group theory software such as gap  @xcite and magma  @xcite has been indispensable in these classifications .",

    "the numbers of groups of the said orders are huge and , without a usable characterization theorem , handling them requires an extensive use of computational resources .",
    "we contribute to the solution of this problem for a special class of 2-groups .",
    "in particular , we are interested in classifying string c - groups of order @xmath0 and exponent at least @xmath1 .",
    "the method of classification we will present takes advantage of the fact that these 2-groups have been previously enumerated , albeit incomplete for groups of exponent exactly @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we outline the paper as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the fundamental concepts and results related to 2-groups and string c - groups .",
    "we also introduce the notations used throughout this paper . in * section [ sec : allgroups ] * , we give the complete list of groups of order @xmath0 and exponent @xmath27 or @xmath1 that are relevant to our study .",
    "further , we compute these groups respective sets of involutions . finally , in * section [ sec : stringc ] * , we state and prove our main result pertaining to the classification of string c - groups of order @xmath0 and exponent at least @xmath1 .",
    "we assume throughout this paper , unless stated otherwise , that @xmath5 is a finite 2-group of order @xmath0 , where @xmath29 is a positive integer .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the _ exponent _ and _ rank _ , respectively , of @xmath5 .",
    "we use @xmath32 to denote the order of an element @xmath33 .    by exponent of a 2-group @xmath5 , we mean the maximum of the orders of all the elements in @xmath5 : @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is the cyclic group of the largest possible order inside @xmath5 .",
    "the _ rank _ of @xmath5 refers to the minimum of the cardinalities of all generating sets for @xmath5 : @xmath36 .    by burnside s basis theorem  @xcite ,",
    "any two minimal generating sets for @xmath5 have the same cardinality equal to @xmath31 .",

    "we have thus proved the following proposition .",

    "+ [ prop:2-grouphom ]    the next result whose proof immediately follows from * proposition [ prop:2-grouphom ] * provides a necessary condition for a 2-group to be generated by its set of _ involutions _ ( elements of order 2 ) : @xmath56 .",
    "this corollary will be used later in * section [ sec : allgroups ] * to show that a given 2-group is not generated by involutions .",

    "[ cor : notgenbyinvs ]      string c - groups of rank 2 are the dihedral groups .",
    "hence , in any classification theorem involving string c - groups , one may work with the assumption that a string c - group @xmath18 has rank at least 3 .",
    "in addition , we can further assume that @xmath6 is connected , since any disconnected string c - group may be expressed as a direct product of subgroups corresponding to the connected components of @xmath6 .",
    "these subgroups , which are generated by distinguished generators and which arise from the induced subdiagrams of @xmath6 , are called _ distinguished subgroups _ of @xmath5 .",
    "examples of string c - groups are symmetry groups of regular convex and star - polytopes , automorphism groups of regular abstract polytopes  @xcite , and string coxeter groups  @xcite . in fact , the `` c '' in the term _ string c - group _ stands for `` coxeter . ''",
    "the connection between string c - groups and string coxeter groups is made much deeper and precise in the following statement : a string c - group @xmath5 is a _",

    "( schlfli ) type _ @xmath62 .    between the two conditions which defines a string c - group , it is the intersection condition that significantly reduces the number of string c - groups from the large number of groups generated by involutions .",
    "it is , however , also the condition that is more difficult to verify especially for groups of high ranks .",
    "this is mainly because there is no known general method for establishing this property for an arbitrary group .",
    "in addition , the number of possible combinations for pairs of subsets of @xmath20 becomes large as the rank gets larger . a method which uses induction on @xmath31 provided by conder and oliveros in  @xcite reduces the number of cases to be checked when establishing the intersection condition .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath63 , there is only one case to check :    the intersection condition is satisfied by the group @xmath64 of rank 3 if @xmath65 .",
    "[ lem : rank3intcond ]    from the * smallgroups * library of gap , we can perform a search to list down the groups of order @xmath0 and exponent @xmath27 for @xmath66 , or exponent @xmath1 for @xmath67 .",
    "we can then check which among the groups in this list appear in the _ atlas of small regular polytopes _ and , hence , are string c - groups .",
    "we have the following classification of string c - groups for these small values of @xmath29 :    * for @xmath66 , there are no connected string c - groups of exponent @xmath27 . * for @xmath68",
    ", there are no connected string c - groups of exponent @xmath1 . * for @xmath69",

    "these groups have gap ids ` [ 64 , 128 ] ` and ` [ 64 , 134 ] ` and have type @xmath73 .",
    "they are isomorphic to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "thus , for a complete classification of string c - groups of order @xmath0 and exponent at least @xmath1 , it suffices to focus on the groups @xmath5 of rank at least 3 that satisfy @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 , or @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
