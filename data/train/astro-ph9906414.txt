    "the study of large - scale structure in the universe plays a vital role in the determination of the cosmological parameters and scenarios that describe the universe from just after its creation to what we see today .",
    "it is the visible structure on scales greater than @xmath12mpc ( where @xmath13 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 ) that can tell us directly about the nature of the initial conditions which could have generated such structures .",
    "most researchers believe that low amplitude gaussian density perturbations , resulting from quantum fluctuations in the earliest stages of cosmic evolution , seeded the large - scale structure we see today ( guth & pi 1982 ; linde 1982 ; bardeen , steinhardt & turner 1983 ) .",
    "( although non - gaussian initial conditions have been suggested , including topological defects ( zeldovich 1980 ; vilenkin 1981 ) and global structures ( turok 1989 ) . )    while the data still remain sparse , there have been a variety of tracers used successfully for observing large - scale structure through redshift studies : individual galaxies in wide - area magnitude - limited and pencil - beam surveys , visually - selected galaxy clusters , plate - scanned clusters , x - ray - selected clusters , groups of galaxies , and cd clusters . on the largest of scales ,",
    "galaxy clusters are more efficient tracers than individual galaxies . while galaxy surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the australian 2df survey will undoubtedly yield excellent datasets for structure analyses , current surveys such as the cfa ( geller & huchra , 1989 ) and the las campanas survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) among others , lack the depth , volume and completeness of coverage needed for accurate evaluations of the two - point correlation function , power spectrum , and other measures of structure on scales of @xmath15mpc and greater . as of the writing of this paper , both the sdss and the 2df surveys are years from completion and public access to the data .",
    "x - ray - selected cluster catalogs avoid visual selection or projection biases .",
    "the thermal x - ray emission from intracluster gas confined to the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters is typically bright and highly peaked at the gravitational center of the clusters . the rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs )",
    "is a 90% complete , flux limited sample of 199 x - ray brightest clusters in the northern hemisphere that has provided a detailed evaluation of the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) out to a redshift @xmath16 ( ebeling , _",
    "this new survey may provide an excellent sample for large - scale structure studies and for comparison with optically identified clusters . however , there are questions as to exactly what type of clusters ( specifically in richness and shape ) the x - ray samples trace .",
    "bahcall & cen ( 1994 ) show that flux - limited x - ray samples contain poor nearby clusters and rich distant clusters .",
    "a flux - limited sample of clusters would contain a mixture of rich and poor clusters , both of which could be incomplete in regions of the observed volume .",
    "struble & ftaclas ( 1994 ) indicate that rich clusters are intrinsically more nearly spherical than poor @xmath17 clusters .",
    "a preferable sample would contain the same type of cluster ( i.e. clusters with similar properties in shape and membership ) , showing a constant average density in a large volume of space .",
    "the first northern sky catalog of rich galaxy clusters was created by george abell in 1958 from visually scanned sky survey plates .",
    "abell s ( 1958 ) @xmath0 clusters are ideally rare for large - scale structure studies .",
    "they have an average spatial separation of @xmath18 mpc , making them very efficient samplers of the mass distribution on scales larger than 100 @xmath19 mpc .",
    "a minimum of telescope time is required to map such large scales with clusters , since spectroscopy of only a few relatively bright galaxies is needed to obtain a reliable redshift for a cluster . for the above reasons , we have chosen the @xmath0 abell clusters as our sparse tracers , assuming that they represent the underlying mass distribution .    in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "several researchers have used optically - observed rich galaxy clusters to trace large - scale structure ( for example , bahcall & soneira 1983 , batuski & burns 1985 and postman , huchra , & geller 1992 ) .",
    "these efforts provide evidence for a strong signal of structure on scales @xmath20 mpc .",
    "however , the samples utilized by these authors suffer from two limitations : small sample size and single redshifts for many clusters .",
    "these limitations impose lower confidence in any of the statistical analyses performed .",
    "prior to the mx northern abell cluster survey , the complete , magnitude - limited sample of abell cluster redshifts extended only to m@xmath21 16.5 , where m@xmath22 is the apparent magnitude ( photored ) of the tenth brightest galaxy within the cluster .",
    "this sample , presented by postman , huchra and geller ( 1992 , hereafter phg ) consisted of 156 @xmath23 abell clusters with @xmath24 .",
    "when a galactic latitude limit of @xmath25 is applied , 126 clusters remain in the sample .",
    "of these 126 , 35 cluster velocities were determined by measuring the redshift of a single galaxy within the respective cluster , resulting in unreasonably large uncertainty in the velocities due to projection .",
    "the small fraction of @xmath0 clusters with observed redshifts , and even smaller fraction with multiple - galaxy - determined redshifts , has resulted in a severely limited sample for large - scale structure studies .",
    "the mx northern abell cluster survey was undertaken in an attempt to rectify these two incompleteness problems associated with the abell sample of clusters : the small number of clusters with multiple - galaxy observed redshifts ( that comprise a complete sample ) and projection effects on cluster membership . the mx survey has increased the latitude - limited , magnitude - limited sample size to 198 @xmath0 clusters ( 98% complete to m@xmath2 ) . at the same time , we have reduced cluster redshift uncertainties , since 187 of these clusters now have more than one measured cluster member redshift .",
    "( 1998 ) have obtained an average of nine cluster member redshifts in 88 observed clusters .",
    "the mx survey has provided a substantially enlarged dataset of @xmath0 abell clusters for the analyses in this paper .",
    "we remind the reader that the @xmath26 subset of abell clusters does not comprise a statistically complete sample .",
    "the @xmath27 clusters were included in the abell catalog only to enhance its value as a cluster finding list ( abell 1958 ; struble & rood 1991 ) , not for use in spatial analyses .",
    "the abell and abell , corwin , and olowin ( 1989-hereafter aco ) catalogs are the only optical cluster catalogs available that cover the entire sky .",
    "the volume of space that is spatially analyzed in this paper is the largest to date .",
    "if structures exist on scales greater than 50@xmath28mpc , any statistical analysis must use volumes of space substantially larger than the size of the largest features .",
    "smaller surveys , such as all current galaxy surveys , pencil - beam surveys and the plate - scanned cluster surveys ( _ e.g. _ apm ) are only marginally large enough to detect very large - scale structure . while the potential of the abell / aco catalogs is obvious , their utility has come under question due to anisotropies detected within the catalogs ( sutherland 1988 ; efstathiou _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; dalton _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; peacock & west 1992 ) .",
    "the analyses used in describing these anisotropies indicate that abell ( 1958 ) preferentially cataloged clusters near the lines - of - sight towards other clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the samples used for these analyses are themselves small and incomplete .",
    "incomplete datasets used in large - scale structure analyses are subject to observational bias .",
    "the sutherland and peacock & west anisotropy analyses used highly incomplete samples . the phg statistical sample of 208 @xmath29 abell clusters ( used by efstathiou _",
    "_ to show anisotropy within the catalog ) is only compete to m@xmath30 and contains over 100 @xmath27 clusters . while there have been a number of papers suggesting that the anisotropy is actually the result of high peculiar velocities , the elongation of cluster pairs in the redshift direction , real geometric elongation of superclusters , or some combination of these",
    ", none has offered definitive observational evidence ( jing _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; bahcall _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the abell / aco @xmath0 clusters form a large and complete dataset with minimal projection effects and line - of - sight anisotropies .",
    "the amplitude and slope of the two - point spatial correlation function are re - examined using the largest ( in number and in volume ) @xmath0 clusters sample to date . in section 2",
    "projection effects are examined , section 3 defines some independent and partially independent samples within the entire dataset for analysis , and section 4 covers the determination of the mean space density of rich clusters . in section 5",
    "we present the cluster - cluster spatial correlation function for the subsamples of clusters .",
    "section 6 discusses the analysis of anisotropies in the abell catalog , and our results are summarized in section 7 .",
    "in past large - scale structure analyses ( using clusters ) , many of the cluster distances were determined by the observation of a single galaxy member ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; phg ) . to examine the uncertainty inherent in using clusters with only one measured redshift , we calculated velocity differences for cluster redshifts published in phg and quintana & ramirez ( 1995 ) when compared to the mx survey redshifts of slinglend _",
    "we used 36 clusters within @xmath31 , all of which had only one measured galaxy before the mx survey and which now have an average of nine galaxy redshifts of cluster members .",
    "figure 1 shows these velocity differences as a function of redshift . a0121 and",
    "a0769 show the most extreme differences of @xmath32 14000 km s@xmath14 and @xmath32 6000 km s@xmath14 respectively .",
    "five of the thirty - six clusters studied have velocity differences of @xmath33 km s@xmath14 or greater , while thirteen differ by @xmath32 500 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we conclude that projected membership ( or at least extreme outliers in the velocity distribution of clusters ) was a problem for 14% of the previously single - measurement clusters .",
    "the velocity errors of @xmath34 km s@xmath14 for the second category of deviations ( in 36% of the clusters ) are the result of typical velocity dispersions within abell clusters which could impact the structure signal on smaller scales ( @xmath35mpc ) .",
    "however , the peculiar velocities of clusters have been shown to be @xmath34 km s@xmath14 ( bahcall & oh 1996 ) , so the use of the hubble flow to study relative cluster positions on such small scales is inappropriate in any case .",
    "nevertheless , the results for the clusters in the higher deviation category indicate that projection ( or selection of a galaxy in the wings of the cluster velocity distribution ) can be problematic when using a sample that has a substantial number of cluster redshifts based on a single measurement .",
    "another concern of clusters in the abell catalog is the misclassification of richness levels .",
    "there have been claims that projection effects on cluster richness designations is a serious problem in the abell catalog ( _ e.g. _ lucey _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 ) . recently however , two of the most extensive rich cluster surveys , the mx survey ( slinglend _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and the enacs survey ( katgert _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , find only @xmath36 of clusters to have more than @xmath37 of galaxies per cluster field to be foreground / background .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) in fact , claimed that up to 30% of the galaxies within a cluster field were background / foreground galaxies .",
    "after subtracting a locally estimated background count , abell determined the total number of galaxies within each cluster to his specified magnitude limit .",
    "clusters containing 30 - 49 galaxies were classified as @xmath26 , clusters containing 50 - 79 galaxies were classified as @xmath11 , and so on .",
    "the difficulty for abell was twofold : ( 1 ) not knowing the redshifts of any of the galaxies in fields he was examining and ( 2 ) having to estimate the redshifts of clusters as well as their linear diameters on the sky ( corresponding to @xmath38mpc ) .",
    "difficulty ( 1 ) was addressed by subtracting the background galaxy count ( derived from a nearby region on the plate apparently ` free ' of clusters ) .",
    "difficulty ( 2 ) was handled by using an m@xmath39 relation derived from 18 clusters with known redshifts ( in 1958 ) .",
    "the 22 galaxies ( on average ) per cluster field observed by the mx survey provides an excellent database for comparing the true background fraction with that estimated by abell .",
    "in addition , we can examine how many clusters had underestimated ( or overestimated ) angular diameters which would affect their richness assignment .",
    "we note that the mx survey has not provided enough galaxy redshifts for a determination of the absolute cluster membership of abell clusters .",
    "we examined galaxies within one abell radius of the cluster center as defined using an m@xmath39 derived from abell ( 1958 ) .",
    "the estimator is @xmath40    we first look at those clusters for which the actual redshift and the estimated redshift differ by less than 4000 km s@xmath14 , _ i.e. _ where abell s distance estimate was ` correct ' .",
    "there are 29/80 such cases and we find that 27% of the galaxies observed in these fields were foreground / background .",
    "therefore , when abell s redshift estimate was near the true redshift of the cluster , subtracting up to @xmath37 of the galaxy count due to foreground / background contamination is appropriate .",
    "for the remaining clusters , we find that the majority of the cluster redshifts ( 44/80 ) are over - estimated using equation ( 1 ) , resulting in a much smaller effective radius within which galaxies were counted . since most abell clusters have well - defined cores",
    ", we expect the fraction of foreground / background galaxies to be lower for these cases .",
    "in fact , we find only 20% contamination when the estimated cluster redshift is much greater ( @xmath41 km s@xmath14 ) than the true redshift . according to abell ( 1958 ) , altering",
    "the angular diameter corresponding to one abell radius ( @xmath42mpc ) by @xmath43 would not affect the richness classification .",
    "however , we find that 37 of the 44 clusters with overestimated redshifts have angular diameters ( corresponding to one abell radius ) on the sky which are more than 30% larger than that used by abell . therefore",
    ", 91% of the clusters in this analysis ( m@xmath44 ) would have the same or greater richness classification had their true redshifts been used .",
    "only 7/80 clusters have underestimated redshifts according to equation ( 1 ) .",
    "these results do not change significantly ( @xmath45 ) when using abell radii up to 2.5 h@xmath14mpc .",
    "the mx survey has provided too few galaxy redshifts per cluster field for an accurate galaxy - member count . however , by examining the true redshifts of the clusters and their foreground / background galaxy fractions , we can conclude that the apparent richnesses , as classified by abell ( 1958 ) , are generally accurate ( or perhaps underestimated ) . since the remaining analyses in this paper are based on @xmath0 clusters , underestimated richness levels would not alter any of the results .",
    "the addition of the mx survey clusters to ones previously measured by other researchers ( phg , struble & rood 1987 ) brings the total number of observed clusters with m@xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath46 to 193 ( out of 198 listed in the abell ( 1958 ) catalog ) .",
    "a recent survey in the southern hemisphere , the eso nearby abell cluster survey ( enacs ) has added redshifts for 104 @xmath0 aco clusters with mean redshifts @xmath47 ( katgert _ et al .",
    "the depth of the enacs survey is similar to the mx survey and thus provides an excellent southern dataset that can be combined with the mx survey for all - sky studies .",
    "we note that there are differences between @xmath0 abell clusters and @xmath48 aco clusters ( _ e.g. _ batuski _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "such differences between the catalogs include : @xmath49 _ vs. _ @xmath50 band magnitude determinations ( aco and abell respectively ) , greater sensitivity of the iiia - j plates used in the aco catalog , and a global determination of the background galaxy count vs. local determinations ( aco and abell respectively ) . for the correlation analyses presented in this paper we will be examining four different subsets of clusters summarized below .    1 .   * the northern magnitude - limited sample * is the 198 abell m@xmath2 , r@xmath51 clusters with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath25 .",
    "five of these clusters have estimated redshifts from the batuski & burns ( 1985 ) magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "* the whole - sky magnitude - limited sample * contains the 198 abell m@xmath2 , r@xmath51 clusters in the above northern sample plus 91 @xmath0 , m@xmath2 , aco clusters with @xmath54 , @xmath52 .",
    "six of the aco clusters have estimated redshifts according to the m@xmath55 relations in the aco the catalog . in section 4",
    ", we find a higher mean density for the aco sample of clusters compared to the abell sample , supporting previous claims that the aco clusters are slightly poorer than their northern counterparts .",
    "therefore , to create a homogeneous sample containing both aco and abell clusters ( to similar richness ) , we have excluded the 14 poorest aco @xmath56 clusters ( those with n@xmath57 where n@xmath58 is the number of galaxies within an abell radius as listed in the aco catalog ) .",
    "the remaining sample of 91 aco clusters has a mean spatial number density similar to that of the abell clusters ( see section 4 ) .",
    "this sample is the largest @xmath0 cluster sample to date and contains 289 clusters .",
    "* the whole - sky statistical sample * is a subset of the previous sample excluding any clusters that lie beyond @xmath59 .",
    "the northern abell cluster magnitude and volume - limited sample contains 156 clusters ( two with estimated redshifts ) .",
    "the southern hemisphere magnitude and volume - limited sample contains 82 aco clusters ( five with estimated redshifts ) .",
    "4 .   * the volume - limited cd sample * contains cd clusters as defined in aco ( 1989 ) .",
    "this sample is volume - limited to @xmath60 h@xmath14mpc , and @xmath52 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we apply no richness constraint to this sample of 104 clusters .",
    "a smaller sample of cd clusters ( @xmath63 ) was previously used for large - scale structure analyses in west & van den bergh ( 1991 ) .",
    "schombert & west ( 1990 ) have shown that cd clusters have a distribution representative of abell clusters in general .",
    "thus by limiting a sample to only cd clusters , we should not be introducing any additional biases .",
    "this sample is somewhat independent from the others , since it has different selection criteria and contains a substantial number of @xmath64 clusters .",
    "distances to all clusters were determined from sandage ( 1975 ) where @xmath65 for a friedman universe with @xmath66 .",
    "all of the samples have an additional constraint of @xmath25 , to limit the effects of galactic obscuration near the plane of the galaxy .",
    "figure 2 shows aitoff projections for the northern magnitude - limited sample and the whole - sky magnitude - limited sample ( in galactic coordinates ) .",
    "the number of clusters within the whole - sky sample makes it the largest set of @xmath0 abell clusters that has yet been used for correlation analyses .",
    "in addition , the volume traced by these clusters ( @xmath67mpc@xmath68 ) is the largest using a complete sample .",
    "together , the large number of clusters and volume of space studied in the following analyses provide a most complete picture of large - scale structure in the local universe .",
    "the number density in a proper volume , @xmath69 , of a survey can be calculated for a friedmann universe ( narlikar 1983 ) : @xmath70\\}^2n_pdz } { q_0 ^ 4(1+z)^6(1 + 2q_0z)^{1/2}}},\\ ] ] and we have @xmath71 for @xmath66 , where @xmath72 is the number of observed clusters within dz and @xmath73 is the solid angle subtended by the survey .",
    "if we include an unknown selection function in z , @xmath74 , and the evolution of @xmath75 via @xmath76 , we must let @xmath77 ( kolb & turner 1990 ) .",
    "for the samples mentioned above , we assume @xmath78 for simplicity , since evolution of the proper number density of clusters should be negligible at these low redshifts and we are only studying a volume that has a nearly constant density ( see figure 3 ) , making s(z ) @xmath79 .",
    "figure 3 shows the number density ( @xmath75 ) as a function of z for the northern magnitude - limited sample and the southern magnitude - limited sample .",
    "the solid angle of the sky covered by the mx northern sample of 198 clusters is 4.25 steradians .",
    "the whole - sky magnitude - limited sample of 282 clusters covers an area of 6.28 steradians ( the entire sky excluding galactic latitudes below @xmath80 . ) using figure 3 , we see the number density no longer being constant at @xmath81 . averaging the weighted mean number densities in figures 3a , b ( to @xmath81 )",
    "we find @xmath82mpc@xmath83 for the northern abell clusters and @xmath84mpc@xmath83 for the southern aco clusters ( using @xmath85 errors ) .",
    "to create the whole - sky clusters sample , we excluded 14 aco clusters ( those with n@xmath57 ) , reducing the density for the aco sample to @xmath86mpc@xmath83 .",
    "[ the mx survey ii is nearing completion after observing most abell clusters with @xmath87 ( miller _ et al . _ 1999 ) .",
    "the additional @xmath32 100 clusters provided by the mx survey ii should increase the density slightly more , as a few low redshift clusters are added . with the results from the mx survey",

    "the number density for the northern clusters implies a mean separation length of @xmath12mpc . for comparison ,",
    "the spatial number density of apm clusters is three times as large at @xmath89mpc@xmath83 .",
    "apm clusters are thus even less rich than @xmath17 abell clusters and therefore much less rare ( bahcall & west 1992 ) . our redshift limit of @xmath59 for the magnitude and volume - limited samples ( discussed in section 3 ) was based on the redshift where @xmath75 differs from @xmath90 by more than 2@xmath91 in figure 3 .",

    "our tests produced results nearly identical to those reported by phg ( table 1 ) , although we would not have been surprised to see small differences as a result of a few different redshifts for clusters that had previously had only one measured redshift ( before the mx survey ) .",

    "the most probable explanation for these correlations is the preferential selection of clusters nearby on the plane of the sky with relatively large separations in redshift .",
    "this indicates that some of the clusters , within the pairs that are causing these high correlations , should have been classified with a lower richness ( and possibly not even @xmath29 clusters at all ) .",
    "we must also recognize the level of incompleteness in the @xmath27 subset of abell clusters as a contributor to these anisotropies , although it is difficult to say exactly what effect this would have .",

    "the remaining anisotropies in our samples , indicated by the 2:1 elongation of @xmath198 ( where @xmath252mpc and @xmath253mpc ) , can be explained by the orientation of two elongated superclusters , ursa majoris and corona borealis . after rotating these well - established superclusters so that their semi - major axes are perpendicular to the line - of - sight , we find no indication of anisotropy in the contour plots of @xmath10 ( see figure 7 ) . therefore , the 2:1 elongation of @xmath198 can be considered a true characteristic of the sample examined , not an indicator of line - of - sight selection biases .",
    "we performed percolation analyses on the whole - sky magnitude - limited sample and find 4 - 5 elongated superclusters with axes ratio of 2.5:1:1 or greater ( depending on the choice of percolation length ) .",
    "if these elongated superclusters were distributed in space with random orientations , the probability of finding two within 25@xmath225 of the line - of - sight is 10% - 15% , which is not unduly unlikely .",
    "thus , it is not surprising to find anisotropies ( as detected by contour plots of the correlation function ) as the result of superclustering along the line - of - sight .",
    "the correlation length and slope of the two - point spatial correlation function , @xmath148 , are very robust for the whole - sky magnitude - limited sample . after rotating ursa majoris and corona borealis so that they are perpendicular to the line - of - sight , both @xmath111 and @xmath110 remain unchanged .",
    "since these rotations remove any evidence of line - of - sight anisotropies within the catalog , we conclude that @xmath111 is not inflated ( compared to the apm clusters ) by these anisotropies .",
    "we also find no change in @xmath111 and @xmath110 after excluding 19 clusters ( from various sources ) that may have heavy foreground / background contamination . this work conflicts with earlier conclusions by sutherland ( 1988 ) ( whose results were then expanded upon in efstathiou",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) and nichol _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) ) , that the abell catalog suffers from a large amount of spurious cluster selection which , in turn , inflates @xmath111 .",
    "while there are certainly individual clusters that show heavy background / foreground contamination , they make up only 10% of the total in our magnitude - complete samples and their exclusion has no effect on the amplitude or slope of the correlation function . if , however , we remove actual structures from the dataset , such as the corona borealis and microscopium superclusters , @xmath111 decreases ( by up to 20% ) and @xmath110 steepens ( from @xmath254 to @xmath255mpc ) . the high value of @xmath111 for @xmath0 abell clusters continues to rule out the standard cdm models and future simulations must be able to reproduce large - scale clustering out to scales of @xmath12mpc .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
