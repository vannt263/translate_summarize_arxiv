    "the image scale was 0.5/pixel .",
    "the total integration time on source was 2880  s. two fields off - set by 1.5  in east - west direction were combined to cover the nuclear region . since the seeing was different in both nights ( @xmath17 1  on july 26 and @xmath3 1.2  on july 28 ) , the data set from july 26 was convolved to the resolution of the second night for the combined data cube with a larger field of view . + 3d obtains simultaneous spectra for each pixel ( r@xmath18 750 for @xmath0 band ) of an 8  @xmath19 8  field .",
    "this is done using an image slicer which rearranges the two - dimensional focal plane onto a long slit of a grism .",

    "a detailed description of the instrument and the data reduction is given in weitzel et al .",
    "the data reduction procedure converts each two dimensional image into a three dimensional data cube with two spatial and one spectral axes .",
    "the data cubes were co - added and centered on the continuum peak .",
    "all images were dark - current and sky - background subtracted , corrected for dead and hot pixels , and spatially and spectrally flat - fielded . to correct for the effects of the earth s atmosphere on the @xmath0 band spectrum ,",

    "the total exposure time was 44660 s and the source was centered on - axis in the field of view .",
    "the centroid position of ngc 6764 in the hri image , computed from a gaussian fit to the spatial distribution is @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the internal rosat hri pointing error is of the order of @xmath23 5  .",

    "the number of background photons normalized to the source cell size is 109 @xmath23 10 .",
    "the resulting number of source photons is therefore 348 @xmath23 25 corresponding to a mean count rate of @xmath24 .",
    "our hri data show both the presence of an x - ray source that strongly varies on the time scale of several days and an additional extended x - ray component that looks similar to published vla radio continuum maps .",

    "a constant light curve model can be rejected with @xmath36 per cent confidence based on a @xmath37 statistic .",
    "the continuous decrease of the rosat hri count rate starting at day 7.9 of the observations further accounts for true changes of the x - ray emission in the distant wolf - rayet liner galaxy ngc 6764 .",
    "the presence of an extended x - ray component ( discussed in section [ soft ] ) that accounts for about half of the total luminosity suggests that the observed variabilitiy ( if entirely attributed to a nuclear source ) was significantly higher than a factor of 2 .",

    "the maximum count rate is @xmath39 observed at day 7.9 within a 1575 s exposure interval .",
    "the light curve of ngc 6764 shows a continuous decline of the count rate starting at day 7.9 up to the end of the observations .",
    "such count rate variations suggest that a major fraction of the variable x - ray emission originates close to a super - massive black hole . assuming that the variability is not affected by beaming or relativistic motions the upper limit for the size of the variable x - ray emission is @xmath40 or only about 10@xmath41au .",
    "the x - ray emission originating from ngc  6764 shows a complex structure : in addition to a source component ( see fig .",
    "[ xxa02 ] ) at the nuclear position , we find an extended structure with indications for different centers of enhanced x - ray emission north - west and south - west of the central position .",
    "the extended emission accounts for about half of the total x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band derived from the mean count rate .",
    "if parts of the extended emission are due to a soft x - ray spectrum , this suggests that the x - ray luminosity of this extended component is either due to bremsstrahlung emission or an emission line dominated spectrum . with the rosat hri and also the pspc observations we are not able to differentiate between bremsstrahlung models and an emission line dominated spectrum from hot diffuse gas based on the model calculations of raymond & smith ( 1977 ) .",
    "the derived plasma temperatures of both models are constistent within the errors",
    ". this would be in agreement with emission from a very diffuse component in addition to a contribution from compact sources indicated by our data and expected from supernovae , hot stars , and x - ray binaries .",
    "eckart et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that the x - ray luminosity could be entirely explained by the energy input of supernovae , and that the total mass of hot gas probably amounts to several 10@xmath42m@xmath4 .",

    "40% of the far - infrared luminosity can be attributed to the nuclear starburst ( inner @xmath3 250  pc ) .",
    "this leaves still enough luminosity for the extended component . therefore , we find that the l@xmath33/l@xmath45 ratio of the extended x - ray emission in ngc  6764 is in agreement with those found for starburst galaxies .",
    "the spatial extent of the extented emission of @xmath3 10  fwhm ( @xmath3 1.6 kpc ) is similar to the extent of starburst rings of about 1 to 2 kpc .",
    "+ we also note that the extended x - ray structure is similar to the structure found in the vla radio maps ( ulvestad , wilson , & sramek 1981 ; wilson & willis 1980 ) .",

    "since ngc  6764 is classified as a liner , we could expect some agn contribution to the br@xmath6 line emission , making the effective temperature a lower limit ( see also section [ xxsb ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that about 66% ( 72% ) of the nuclear h@xmath47 ( h@xmath52 ) line emission which is coming from a narrow line component is of stellar origin ( i.e. consistent with hii region line ratios ; gonalves , veron - cetty & veron 1999 ) .",

    "the presences of both wn and wc stars therefore suggests an age between 3 and 5 myrs for the nuclear stellar population in ngc  6764 associated with the wr stars .      in our starburst model calculations , we used a salpeter imf with a lower mass cut - off of 1 m@xmath4  and an upper mass cut - off of 120 m@xmath4 .",
    "the wr stars signal that massive star formation has occured recently or is still ongoing . on the other hand , an older stellar population that produces most of the @xmath0 band continuum must be present .",
    "therefore only two simple scenorios can be considered producing the observed properties : ( 1 ) two starburst events describing discontinuous star formation due to episodic fueling with molecular gas and ( 2 ) continuous star formation assuming continuous fueling with molecular gas and/or a large nuclear reservoir of gas .",
    "+ in a first step we tried to fit the diagnostic ratios for the two different scenarios . when the predicted l@xmath61  and l@xmath57  luminosities were matched to the observed values .",
    "the spectral synthesis was used to address the non - stellar properties of the nuclear region such as extinction , dust emission or agn continuum contribution which also effect the overall values .",
    "however , the derived values are rather small : for the spectral synthesis fitting ( which is independent of l@xmath61 , since it is tied to the calibrated spectrum ) , we tried apparent extinction values of @xmath63=1@xmath64 , 2@xmath64 , 3@xmath64 , 4@xmath64 and 5@xmath64 .",
    "for the two star formation scenarios considered here , we find an extinction of ( 2 - 3)@xmath64 ( mainly affecting the slope of the @xmath0 band spectrum at shorter wavelength end ) combined with a @xmath3 5% non - stellar contribution to the @xmath0 band continuum which is either due to emission from warm dust ( @xmath65 @xmath3 500 k ) or agn power law emission ( affecting the slope of the @xmath0 band spectrum at the longer wavelength end ) .",
    "we used the mean flux density at large radii ( r @xmath3 3.5  ) to estimate the contribution of the underlying old bulge population to about 10 % of the @xmath0 band continuum flux density in a 3  aperture .",
    "however , the bulge population has a much larger spatial extent than the stellar cluster mapped in its stellar absorption lines .",
    "+ both star formation possibilities are explored in the following .",
    "the model parameters and results of the star forming events for the different scenarios are given in tab .",
    "[ xxt04 ] .",
    "as discussed in section [ xxwr ] the wr stars have an age of about 3 - 5 myr .",
    "this low age immediately implies a second starburst or star formation event that is responsible for the cool evolved stars indicated by the stellar absorption features ( s. section [ xxco ] ) .",
    "+   + _ starburst about 3 - 5  myr ago ( sb#1 ) : _ assuming a starburst event with a decay time of 3  myr seems reasonable given the fact that sn explosions might disturb the ism and prevent further star formation . for a starburst in that age range , stars gives a mean ionizing hot star of type o7 to o5 with a mean effective temperature of t@xmath51 @xmath66 40000 - 45000k .",
    "neglecting dilution effects ( s. section [ xxheh ] ) this corresponds to an hei / br@xmath6 ratio of 0.7 ( lanon & rocca - volmerage 1996 ) .",
    "a comparison of @xmath0 band spectra from galaxies with agn and pure starburst galaxies ( vanzi et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that a strong hei emission line is only present in the pure starburst galaxies without an agn .",
    "this probably indicates that most of the hei line flux observed towards the nucleus of ngc  6764 is due to young , hot stars and not due to an agn component . under the assumption that all hei line flux is associated with the starburst , we can correct the observed hei / br@xmath6 ratio of 0.46@xmath230.04 to obtain the br@xmath6 line flux associated with the starburst event . to fit the model ratio of 0.7 about 65% of the observed br@xmath6 line flux",
    "has to be due to the 5  myr old starburst .",
    "this finding is in excellent agreement with the value of 66% for the h@xmath47 line emission of gonalves , veron - cetty & veron ( 1999 ) . by fitting l@xmath57",
    ", we obtained the contibutrions of this starburst to l@xmath61 , l@xmath55  and @xmath58 . the remaining differences in these quantities have to be attributed to the second starburst ( or star formation ) event and are used for the further model fits .",
    "+   + _ starburst about 25 myr ago ( sb#2 ) : _ the first starburst contributes only a few percent to the @xmath0 band luminosity , and the old bulge population delivers about 10 % ( see section [ xxold ] ) .",
    "therefore , this second starburst has to account for about 85% of the total l@xmath61  and the total amount of @xmath58  without further large contributions to l@xmath57 .",
    "a @xmath3 15 myr old starburst can account for most of the remaining l@xmath57 .",
    "however , if the age is about 25  myr almost all of the remaining 35% of the br@xmath6 line flux could be associated with the liner nucleus ( s. table [ xxt04 ] ) . at an age of 50  myr ,",
    "the contribution of this starburst to the lyman continuum is already negligible and only small to the nuclear radio continuum .",
    "we also tested ages of @xmath3 1  gyr where agb stars have a prominent contribution to the @xmath0 band continuum ( lanon 1999 , lanon et al .",
    "1999 ) . this possibility can be ruled out , since at that age the radio emission could no longer be explained by star formation , i.e. synchrotron emission from sn remnants .",
    "the age for this second starburst event can not be so strict as in the case of the wr starburst , since it is not possible to absolutely constrain the contribution of this starburst to the @xmath0 band luminosity , the lyman continuum luminosity and the sn rate .",
    "however , its age has to be larger than 15 myr and below 50  myr which is well below 1  gyr .",
    "also , an underlying low - level constant star formation is impossible , since such a population can not produce the l@xmath61  needed without large contributions to l@xmath57  ( see section [ xxcs ] ) .",
    "+   + this scenario is quite opposite to the one found in ic  342 where a 70  pc diameter starburst ring with an age of about 5  myr surrounds a nuclear starburst of about 15  myr ( bker , frster - schreiber & genzel 1997 ) . in ngc  6764 the younger component ( _ sb#1 _ ) is concentrated in the nucleus and surrounded or embedded in the older star formation event ( _ sb#2 _ ) .",
    "higher angular resolution would allow us to investigate if the _ sb#1 _ component is indeed concentrated on the nucleus or is distributed in a small ring like in ic  342 .",
    "a comparison of the contribution of the two starburst events to the optical continuum shows that the wr burst contributes about 15% to the synthesized stellar @xmath67 band continuum .",
    "this is in agreement with the 11% continuum contribution derived by osterbrock & cohen ( 1982 ) .",
    "if we assume continuous star formation in the nuclear region the nuclear stellar population must have an age of @xmath53 1 gyr , since only then enough cool evolved stars have been produced to obtain the observed ratio of l@xmath56 to l@xmath57 .",
    "it is necessary to reach at least the agb phase for a reasonable fit , since only then enough of the observed cool luminous stars are present .",
    "this analysis is , however , hampered by the fact , that the evolutionary tracks of the high mass stars do not produce very cold red supergiants ( e.g. of type m ) and that specsyn does not use spectra of agb stars .",
    "the spectra of agb stars are approximated by those of a red supergiant ( rsg ) of type m4iab .",
    "this may affect the slope at the beginning of the @xmath0 band , however , specsyn spectra start only at 2.0267 @xmath15 m there this effect is already weak . since only a small fraction of the total @xmath0 band light is due to agb stars ,",
    "this is neglegible and for the purpose of the nir spectral synthesis sufficient .",
    "+ the derived star formation rate ( sfr ) of this scenario is @xmath3 0.3 m@xmath4/yr . for an age of the stellar population of 1 gyr this translates into about 3@xmath1910@xmath68 m@xmath4  of molecular gas that have been transformed into stars .",
    "the average star formation effiency ( sfe ) in giant molecular cloud complexes ( gmcs ) is of the order of a few percent ( duerr et al .",

    "bars are relative efficient in transporting gas down to small radii , jogee , kenney & smith ( 1999 ) found a mass inflow rate of about 1 m@xmath4/yr for the central starburst in ngc  2782",
    ". however , eckart et al . (",
    "1991 ) estimated a total molecular gas mass of 2 - 6 @xmath1910@xmath68 m@xmath4  for ngc  6764 . together with the fact that bars are short - lived features in the evolution of galaxy ( @xmath3 10@xmath68 yrs ; combes 1998 )",
    ", such a high inflow rate over 1 gyr seems highly unlikely . +",
    "another aspect of this scenario is that the wr emission ( hei and br@xmath6 line ) and the stellar absorption bands should have similar distributions even at highest spatial resolution .",
    "however , this is already in contradiction to the observed spatial distribution of the h and he recombination lines ( unresolved ) versus the extent of the stellar absorption lines ( similar to @xmath0 band continuum ) .",
    "it might be a possible scenario that due to dispersion of the nuclear stellar cluster the older stars have moved to larger radii .",
    "a comparison to the upper limit of @xmath3 3@xmath1910@xmath69 m@xmath4  for the total mass in the inner 5 ",
    "( eckart et al . 1991 ) shows that the converted gas mass is only a small fraction ( @xmath3 10% ) and therefore we expect the gravitational potential to minimize such an effect .",
    "in addition , a continuous star formation would account for the total h recombination line emission without any emission arising from the agn .",
    "therefore continuous star formation is higly unlikely , although the spectral fit ( see fig . [ xxa07 ] ) is equally satisfying .",
    "ngc6764 shows strong variations in its x - ray flux density by at least a factor of 2 on time - scales of 7 days .",
    "this suggests the presence of a compact agn with an upper size estimate of @xmath40 or only about 10@xmath41au .",
    "in addition there is evidence for an extended and possibly soft diffuse component of the x - ray emission .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting gas and the synchrotron radiation emitting relativistic gas component are spatially coexisting and are probably both the result of strong recent nuclear star formation .",
    "+ nir integral field spectroscopy of the nuclear region in the wr liner galaxy ngc  6764 reveals that the nuclear star formation is probably confined to two areas , one of less than 100  pc ( wr stars ) and the other with an extent of @xmath3 200  pc ( rsgs ) : the wr stars and the evolved cool stars are not co - spatial and the younger starburst resides inside the older starburst .",
    "this picture is quite contrary to what is observed in many starburst galaxies where the younger component is arranged in a ring around the older nucleus ( e.g. ngc  7552 : schinnerer et al .",
    "1997 , ic  342 : bker , frster - schreiber & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "+ application of a population synthesis in conjunction with nir spectral synthesis infers an extinction towards the nuclear stellar cluster of about ( 2 - 3)@xmath64 in agreement with the observed br@xmath50/br@xmath6 ratio and earlier findings by eckart et al .",
    "in addition we see evidence for a 5% non - stellar contribution to the @xmath0 band continuum either from warm dust or a power law contribution from the agn itself . in a 3  aperture",
    "the @xmath0 band contribution of the bulge population is about 10% .",

    "( 2 ) continuous star formation with a sfr of @xmath3 0.3 m@xmath4/yr for at least 1  gyr .",

    "comparison of our data and data from the literature with population synthesis results for wr dominated cluster suggests an age of 3 - 5 myr for the wr component in ngc  6764 .",
    "the age for the second starburst event is in the range of 15 myr to well below 1 gyr depending on the contribution of this starburst to the lyman continuum and the radio continuum observed .",
    "+ the continuous star formation scenario seems highly unlikely given the larger amount of molecular gas needed to be transported down to radii of @xmath3 160  pc over 1 gyr .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of the line emission is expected to be cospatial with the stellar absorption lines - this is not observed .",
    "even if we allowed for an unresolved 35% agn contribution to the br@xmath6 such a case seems unlikely , because there is no indication for extended emission on a lower level in the radial profile of the br@xmath6 line emission .",
