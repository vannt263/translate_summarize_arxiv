    "they further suggest that the conventional long _ vs. _ short grb classification scheme may be modified as type i ( from mergers ) _ vs. _ type ii ( from collapsars ) grbs , and that grb 060614 belongs to type i ( see also zhang 2006 ) .    some authors have attempted to determine the luminosity function ( @xmath14 ) and the local rate ( @xmath15 ) of long grbs through fitting the @xmath16 or @xmath17 distributions observed by cgro / batse ( schmidt 2001 ; stern et al . 2002 ; lloyd - ronning et al . 2002 ; norris 2002 ; guetta et al . 2005 )",

    "although this result could not fully rule out the possibility that ll - grbs are simply the low luminosity end of the hl - grb population(guetta et al . 2004 ) , it does disfavor such a possibility . in the above analysis",
    "we do not consider the difference of the beaming effects for both hl- and ll - grbs and the lf cosmological evolution effect . as we discuss below",
    ", the ll - grbs are likely less collimated and are detectable in the nearby universe only .",
    "as discussed above , the high detection rate of the ll - grbs motivates us to consider the ll - grbs as a distinct grb population from the hl - grbs .",
    "the conventional hl - grbs generally have a luminosity of @xmath18 erg @xmath119 .",
    "we therefore take a preliminary criterion of @xmath120 erg @xmath119 to select our ll - grb sample .",
    "ll - grbs are faint .",
    "they are only detectable in a small volume of the local universe and a large amount of the population are below the sensitivity threshold of the detector . the observable ll - grbs with _",
    "swift _ are rare events comparable to hl - grbs .",
    "it is unlikely to establish a large sample with the current grb missions , so it is difficult to investigate @xmath121 through fitting its @xmath16 distribution or through our 1-d criteria ( as is done for the hl - population ) .",
    "we can only roughly constrain the @xmath121 and @xmath7 with a few detections and limits of ll - grbs .",
    "grbs 980425 and 060218 are two firm detections of ll - grbs .",
    "there are also two other marginal detections for the ll - grbs , i.e. , grbs 031203 ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 erg s@xmath10 ) and 020903 ( @xmath124 , soderberg et al .",

    "similarly , the @xmath66 is constrained by grbs 031203 and 020903 .",
    "based on these observational constraints we search for @xmath130 and @xmath131 by taking @xmath132 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "we find @xmath133 and @xmath134 can roughly reflect these constraints .",

    "is shown fig .",
    "it is found that the ll - grbs form a distinct `` island '' from the main `` continental '' population . the detection rate of the ll - grbs thus can be explained without over - predicting the hl - grbs .",

    "so far there is no robust evidence of such an evolutionary effect with the grb sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this effect also does not affect @xmath121 , since the ll - grbs are likely detectable only at low redshifts .",
    "it may influence the derivation of @xmath2 . a large sample of spectroscopic redshift measurements is required to more robustly evaluate this effect .",
    "the current hl - grb sample is inadequate for this task .",
    "therefore , we do not consider this effect in this analysis .",
    "in the future , using a sample established by _ swift _ within 5 year operation one may be able to robustly model this effect , and the constraints on the luminosity function of hl - grbs could be further refined .",
    "our results tentatively suggest that ll - grbs are an intrinsically different grb population , characterized by a high local rate , low luminosity , and small beaming factor comparing to the hl - grbs .",
    "the detectable low redshift grbs should be dominated by the ll - grbs .",
    "le & dermer ( 2007 ) draw the similar conclusion through modeling the redshift distribution of the _ swift _ grbs . however , we pointed out that the current data do not conclusively exclude the possibility that only one population of grbs is responsible for both hl- and ll - grbs(guetta et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "there are two scenarios to explain the nature of the ll - grbs .",
    "one scenario is that these grbs are standard hl - grbs viewed off - axially ( e.g. nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ; yamazaki et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to account for the step - like two - component lf displayed in fig .",
    "[ lf ] , the jet must include two distinct components , i.e. a narrow hl component and a very wide ll component .",
    "such a jet configuration is different from the conventional jet - cocoon picture in the standard collapsar model in which the cocoon component is not as broad as 31@xmath13 ( e.g. zhang et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the lack of detection of radio re - brightening in grb 980425 and grb 031203 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2004a , b ) has also greatly constrained this scenario ( waxman 2004a , b ) .",
    "the second scenario is that ll - grbs are intrinsically different from hl - grbs ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "2000 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2004b ; mazzali et al .",
    "actually , the ll - grbs as a unique grb population has been proposed since the discovery of grb 980425/sn1998bw with its observed under - luminous , long - lag , simple light curve features ( e.g. , soderberg et al . 2004b ) .",
    "stern et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested a group of `` simple '' bursts with peak fluxes near the batse trigger threshold .",
    "norris ( 2002 ) found that the proportion of long - lag , single - pulse bursts ( similar to the three ll - grbs ) within long - duration bursts increases from negligible among bright batse bursts to@xmath184 at the trigger threshold , and their peak flux @xmath6 orders of magnitude lower than that of the brightest bursts .",
    "taken together with the fact that three nearby grbs , 980425 , 031203 , and 060218 , are long - lag and under - luminous ( e.g. , sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , an intuitive speculation of the observed ll - grbs is that that they are probably relatively nearby ( e.g. , norris et al . 2005 ) and their local rate should be much higher that conventional hl - grbs as we derived in this analysis .",
    "this scenario calls for a different type of progenitors ( e.g. neutron stars rather than black holes ) for ll - grbs from those of hl - grbs ( e.g. mazzali et al . 2006 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2006b ) . the abundant multi - wavelength observations of grb 060218",
    "lead us make a step toward to the nature of this kind of events ( wang & mszros 2006 ; fan et al . 2006 ; dai et al .",
    "2006 ; li 2007 ; ghisellini et al . 2006,2007",
    "; wang et al .",
    "2006 ; gupta & zhang 2007 ; murase et al . 2006 ; amati et al . 2006",
    "; liang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "future detectors more sensitive to _ swift _ bat , e.g. exist ( grindley 2006 ) , would detect much more of these events and greatly increase the sample of ll - grbs .",
    "we have derived the luminosity function and the local rate of the hl - grbs with the _ swift _ @xmath4-known grb sample and explored the possibility that ll - grbs as a unique grb population from the hl - grbs .",
    "we find that @xmath7 is @xmath8 gpc@xmath9 yr@xmath10 , which is much higher than @xmath3(@xmath11 gpc@xmath9 yr@xmath10 ) .",
    "this rate is @xmath12 of the local type ib / c sne .",
    "our results , together with the finding that less than 10% of type",
    "ib / c sne are associated with off - beam grbs , suggest that ll - grbs have a beaming factor typically less than 14 , or a jet angle typically wider than 31@xmath13 .",
    "the high local grb rate , the small beaming factor , and low luminosity make the ll - grbs distinct from the hl - grbs .",
    "although the current data could not fully rule out the possibility that both hl- and ll - grbs are the same population , our results suggest that ll - grbs are likely a unique grb population and the observed low redshift grb sample is dominated by ll - grbs .",
    "we note that guetta & della valle ( 2007 ) reproduce the three main results , i.e. , the high local rate of ll - grbs , hl- and ll - grbs as two populations , and wide jet opening angle for ll - grbs , three months after we posted this paper to astro - ph .",
    "they also suggest that the possibility of one population for both the hl- and ll - grbs ( guetta et al .",
    "2004 ) can not be convincingly ruled out .",
