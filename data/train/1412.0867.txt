    "a central theme in cosmology is the perplexing fact that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerating expansion @xcite . in this context , during the last two decades cosmology has evolved from being mainly a theoretical area of physics to become a field supported by high precision observational data .",
    "recent experiments call upon state of the art technology in astronomy and in astrophysics to provide detailed information on the contents and history of the universe , which has led to the measuring of the parameters that describe our universe with increasing precision",
    ". the standard model of cosmology is remarkably successful in accounting for the observed features of the universe .",
    "however , there remain a number of fundamental open questions at the foundation of the standard model .",
    "in particular , we lack a fundamental understanding of the acceleration of the late universe .",
    "what is the so - called `` dark energy '' that is driving the acceleration of the universe ?",
    "is it a vacuum energy or a dynamical field ? or is the acceleration due to infra - red modifications of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) ?",
    "how is structure formation affected in these alternative scenarios ? what will the outcome be of this acceleration for the future fate of the universe ? indeed , the fact that gr is facing so many challenges , namely , the difficulty in explaining particular observations , the incompatibility with other well established theories and the lack of uniqueness , may be indicative of a need for new gravitational physics .",
    "the resolution of these fundamental questions is extremely important for theoretical cosmology , looking beyond the standard theory of gravity .",
    "the standard model of cosmology has favoured the dark energy models as fundamental candidates responsible for the cosmic accelerated expansion .",
    "however , it is clear that these questions involve not only gravity , but also particle physics .",
    "string theory provides a synthesis of these two branches of physics and is widely believed to be moving towards a viable quantum gravity theory .",
    "one of the key predictions of string theory is the existence of extra spatial dimensions . in the brane - world scenario , motivated by recent developments in string theory ,",
    "the observed 3-dimensional universe is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the new degrees of freedom belong to the gravitational sector , and can be responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite . of course , cosmology is also an ideal testing ground for gr ( in particular , the problem of the late - time cosmic acceleration ) .",
    "thus , a promising approach is to assume that at large scales gr breaks down , and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "gr is a classical theory , therefore no reference to an action is required @xcite .",
    "consider the hilbert - einstein action @xmath0 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the curvature scalar and @xmath2 is the matter lagrangian , in which matter is minimally coupled to the metric @xmath3 and @xmath4 collectively denotes the matter fields .",
    "however , the lagrangian formulation is elegant , and has merits .",
    "first , at the quantum level , the action acquires a physical meaning , and a more fundamental theory of gravity will provide an effective gravitational action at a suitable limit .",
    "secondly , it is easier to compare alternative gravitational theories through their actions rather than by their field equations .",
    "thirdly , in many cases one has a better grasp of the physics as described through the action , by considering the couplings , kinetic and the dynamical terms .",
    "in fact , einstein , in deriving gr was not motivated to account for unexplained experimental results , but was driven by theoretical criteria of elegance and simplicity @xcite .",
    "his primary goal was to produce a gravitation theory that incorporated the principle of equivalence and special relativity in a natural way .",
    "however , at the end of the day the theory had to be confronted with experiment , in particular , the `` three classical tests '' : ( i ) accounts for the perihelion advance of mercury ; ( ii ) eddington s measurement of light deflection , in 1919 ; ( iii ) pound and rebka measure the gravitational redshift ( in 1960 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the late 1950s , schiff and dicke suggested that the gravitational redshift was not a true test of gr .",
    "it was purely a consequence of the equivalence principle , and did not test the field equations of gravitational theory .",
    "note that by 1960 , one may consider that the validity of gr rested upon the following empirical foundation @xcite ( i ) one test of moderate precision ( the perihelion shift of mercury ; precision : approx .",
    "1% ) ; ( ii ) one test of low precision ( the deflection of light ; precision : approx .",
    "50% ) ; ( iii ) one inconclusive test that was not a real test anyway ( the gravitational redshift ) .",
    "in the meantime , alternative theories of gravitation were being constructed ( poincar , whitehead , milne , birkhoff , belinfante , etc ) , that also laid claim to the viability of the above tests .",
    "this triggered the development of powerful tools for distinguishing and testing theories , such as the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) expansion , pioneered by nordvedt and extended by nordvedt and will @xcite .",
    "indeed , the idea that experiments test principles and not specific theories , implies the need of exploring the conceptual basis of a gravitational theory .",
    "probably the most unbiased assumptions to start with , in developing a gravitation theory is the dicke framework @xcite , which states that : ( i ) spacetime is a 4-dim manifold , with each point in the manifold corresponding to a physical event ( note that a metric and affine connection is not necessary at this stage ) ; ( ii ) the equations of gravity and the mathematical entities in them are to be expressed in a form that is independent of the coordinates used , i.e. , in a covariant form .",
    "it is common to think of gr , or any other gravitation theory , as a set of field equations ( or an action ) .",
    "however , a complete and coherent axiomatic formulation of gr , or any other gravitation theory , is still lacking .",
    "one needs to formulate `` principles '' and an important one is the covariance principal , present in the dicke framework @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic criteria for the viability of a gravitation theory , following c. will @xcite , are the following .",
    "( i ) it must be complete : the theory should be able to analyse from `` first principles '' the outcome of any experiment ; ( ii ) it must be self - consistent : predictions should be unique and independent of the calculation method ; ( iii ) it must be relativistic : the theory should reduce to special relativity when gravity is `` turned off '' ; ( iv ) it must have the correct newtonian limit : in the limit of weak gravitational fields and slow motion it should reproduce newton s laws .",
    "note also that the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) is at the heart of gravitation theory @xcite .",
    "thus if the eep is valid , then gravitation must be a curved spacetime phenomenon , i.e. , it must obey the postulates of metric theories of gravity : ( i ) spacetime is endowed with a metric ( second rank non - degenerate tensor ) ; ( ii ) the world lines of test bodies are geodesics of that metric ; ( iii ) in local freely falling frames , lorentz frames , the non - gravitational laws of physics are those of special relativity .      on the other hand , generalizations of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , including quadratic lagrangians , involving second order curvature invariants , such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , have also been extensively explored @xcite .",
    "the main physical motivations for these modifications of gravity consist of a possibility of a more realistic representation of the gravitational fields near curvature singularities , and to create some first order approximation for the quantum theory of gravitational fields .",
    "while these modified theories of gravity , or dark gravity , offer an alternative explanation to the standard cosmological model for the expansion history of the universe @xcite , it offers a paradigm for nature fundamentally distinct from dark energy models of cosmic acceleration @xcite , even those that perfectly mimic the same expansion history .",
    "it is fundamental to understand how one may differentiate these modified theories of gravity from dark energy models .",
    "an explicit distinction between models of `` dark energy '' and `` modified gravity '' is necessary .",
    "this is due to the fact that models consisting of modifications to the gravitational sector can be mapped into a specific subset of scalar - tensor theories , namely , to a class of interacting scalar field dark energy models universally coupled to the matter species .",
    "thus , due to this ambiguity , a practical classification is needed .",
    "in fact , taking into account solely the expansion rate of the universe , one can not discriminate between the dark energy models and modified gravity .",
    "however , these two alternative models will affect structure formation differently .",
    "therefore , information on the growth of structure , at different scales and redshifts , will break the degeneracy and will serve to discriminate between both models of dark energy and modified gravity . more specifically , using linear perturbation theory , these alternative models will affect differently the constraints imposed by the einstein equations , and the second - order growth equation will be modified , consequently changing the growth factor @xcite . thus , generic modifications of the dynamics of scalar perturbations , with respect to the @xmath10cdm background , can be represented by the introduction of two new degrees of freedom in the einstein constraint equations , by the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale factor and @xmath14 the perturbation scale .    in the context of modified gravity , the function @xmath11 results from a mass - screening effect due to local modifications of gravity , and effectively modifies newton s constant . in the context of dynamical dark energy models ,",
    "the function @xmath11 incorporates additional clustering , or interaction with other fields , due to the perturbations .",
    "the function @xmath15 , absent in @xmath10cdm , parameterizes the effective stresses due to the modification of gravity or specific dynamical dark energy models .",
    "finally , the scale and time - dependence of both functions , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , can be derived in the specific model considered and projected on a @xmath17 plane .",
    "following @xcite , we denote the term `` modified gravity '' when there are additional contributions to the poisson equation , which induces @xmath18 , and where extra effective stresses arise , implying @xmath19 .",
    "thus , `` modified gravity '' denotes models in which modifications are present in the gravitational sector and in which dark energy clusters or interacts with other fields .",
    "thus , following this practical classification outlined in @xcite , in the context of first order perturbation theory , models with @xmath20 are denoted standard dark energy models , such as , a minimally - coupled scalar field with standard kinetic energy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "models for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are denoted `` modified gravity '' , such as scalar - tensor theories , @xmath21 gravity @xcite , the dgp model @xcite and generalizations @xcite , massive gravity and generalized galileons @xcite , horndeski interactions @xcite , bi-(multi- ) gravity @xcite , etc .",
    "thus , in the context of the euclid mission @xcite , the definitions of the functions @xmath16 and @xmath15 are extremely convenient , for instance , euclid can distinguish between standard dynamical dark energy and modified gravity by forecasting the errors on @xmath16 and @xmath15 , and several combinations of these functions , such as @xmath22 .",
    "in modified gravity , in particular , in @xmath21 gravity , one may tackle the problem using the metric formalism , which consists in varying the action with respect to the metric , although other alternative approaches have been considered in the literature , namely , the palatini formalism @xcite , where the metric and the connections are treated as separate variables ; and the metric - affine formalism , where the matter part of the action now depends and is varied with respect to the connection @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel approach to modified theories of gravity that consists of adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian an @xmath21 term constructed a la palatini , was proposed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the theory can pass the solar system observational constraints even if the scalar field is very light .",
    "this implies the existence of a long - range scalar field , which is able to modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics , but leaves the solar system unaffected .",
    "these explicit models are consistent with local tests and lead to the late - time cosmic acceleration , and also verify the absence of instabilities in perturbations .",
    "this hybrid metric - palatini theory will be briefly outlined and explored below .",
    "the cosmological applications of generalized @xmath21-type gravity models by assuming that the gravitational lagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 and of the matter lagrangian @xmath23 has also been extensively analysed @xcite .",
    "specific models were explored in detail , and the gravitational field equations in the metric formalism , in the presence of a nonminimal coupling were obtained , as well as the equations of motion for test particles , which follow from the covariant divergence of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite . generally , the motion is non - geodesic , and takes place in the presence of an extra force orthogonal to the four - velocity .",
    "the newtonian limit of the equation of motion was also considered , and a procedure for obtaining the energy - momentum tensor of the matter was presented .",
    "on the other hand , the gravitational field equations are equivalent to the einstein equations of the @xmath21 model in empty spacetime , but differ from them , as well as from standard general relativity , in the presence of matter .",
    "therefore the predictions of the model could lead to some major differences , as compared to the predictions of standard general relativity , or its extensions ignoring the role of matter , in several problems of current interest , such as cosmology , gravitational collapse or the generation of gravitational waves .",
    "the study of these phenomena may also provide some specific signatures and effects , which could distinguish and discriminate between the various theories of modified gravity .      in the context of scalar fields ,",
    "these are popular building blocks used to construct models of present - day cosmological acceleration .",
    "they are appealing because such fields are ubiquitous in theories of high energy physics beyond the standard model , and , in particular , are present in theories which include extra spatial dimensions , such as those derived from string theories .",
    "the initial simplest model consisted of a minimally coupled single scalar field self - interacting through a scalar potential , and with canonical kinetic terms .",
    "this was named a quintessence field @xcite .",
    "an interesting model described as coupled quintessence analysed the consequences of coupling the field responsible for acceleration to matter fields @xcite .",
    "the model was rapidly extended to consider non - canonical kinetic terms , with higher powers of the field s velocity , denoted @xmath14-essence @xcite , and non - minimal couplings to gravity .",
    "such models included scalar tensor theories and gauss - bonnet dark energy .",
    "a lagrangian based on the galileon symmetry , with second order derivative terms , has been shown to provide a working model with interesting cosmological implications @xcite .",
    "given the large number of models , the question arises how we should study and compare them in a unified manner , and determine which if any is the origin of cosmic acceleration .",
    "a particularly useful tool in this direction is the realisation that all these classes of models are special cases of the most general lagrangian which leads to second order field equations .",
    "this lagrangian was first written down by horndeski in 1974 @xcite and rediscovered by deffayet _ et al _ in 2011 @xcite .",
    "it enables researchers to adopt a unifying framework , and to determine the regions within this general theory that have appealing theoretical properties . in combination with the need to fit observations such properties are helpful in preferring regions of this general theory , and hence particular models .",
    "one example of such an appealing theoretical property is the possibility that terms within the horndeski lagrangian can be used to partially explain the huge discrepancy between the value of the vacuum energy in particle physics , and the value of the cosmological constant as inferred from cosmological observations . in particular these terms",
    "have been investigated with the aim of finding a viable self - tuning mechanism , which screens the spacetime curvature from the net cosmological constant @xcite . while not yet a full theory of cosmological evolution , such a mechanism is intriguing , and leads to the question of whether realistic cosmologies can be constructed which include this mechanism as well as the late time acceleration .",
    "another gravitational modification that has recently attracted much interest is the massive gravity paradigm , where instead of introducing new scalar degrees of freedom such as in @xmath21 gravity , it modifies the graviton itself .",
    "massive gravity is a well - defined theoretical problem by its own and has important cosmological motivations , namely , if gravity is massive it will be weaker at large scales and thus one can obtain the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "fierz and pauli presented the first linear massive gravity .",
    "however , it was shown to suffer from the van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite , namely the massless limit of the results do not yield the massless theory , i.e. , general relativity .",
    "the incorporation of nonlinear terms cured the problem but introduced the boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost .",
    "this fundamental problem puzzled physicists until recently , where a specific nonlinear extension of massive gravity was proposed by de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) , in which the bd ghost is eliminated by a secondary hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "this new nonlinear massive gravity has interesting cosmological implications , for instance , it can give rise to inflation , late - time acceleration , etc @xcite .",
    "however , the basic versions of this theory exhibit instabilities at the perturbative level , and thus suitable extensions are necessary",
    ". these could be anisotropic versions , @xmath21 extensions , bi - metric generalizations , partially - massive constructions , etc .",
    "an interesting possibility consists in a graviton mass varying function of a new scalar field @xcite , where the graviton mass would be effectively larger at early cosmological times , implying interesting phenomenology both at early and late times .",
    "the crucial issue is whether one can construct a massive gravity and cosmology that can be consistent as an alternative to dark energy or other models of modified gravity , and whether this theory is in agreement with high - accuracy cosmological data , such as the growth - index or the tensor - to - scalar ratio ones , remains to be explored in detail .      in modified gravitational theories",
    "one usually generalizes the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity , namely , one starts from the curvature description of gravity .",
    "however , a different and interesting class of modified gravity arises when one generalizes the action of the equivalent formulation of gr based on torsion .",
    "as is well known , einstein also constructed the `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' ( tegr ) in which the gravitational field is described by the torsion tensor and not by the curvature .",
    "in tegr the corresponding lagrangian is given by the torsion scalar @xmath24 , and it results from contractions of the torsion tensor , in a similar way that the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath1 results from contractions of the curvature ( riemann ) tensor .",
    "thus , in analogy with @xmath21 gravity , one can start from tegr and construct the @xmath25 modified theories of gravity , by extending @xmath24 to an arbitrary function in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature is that although tegr is completely equivalent to general relativity at the level of the field equations , @xmath25 differs radically from @xmath21 gravity , in that they form different gravitational modifications .",
    "hence , @xmath25 gravity has novel and interesting cosmological implications , capable of describing inflation , the late - time acceleration @xcite , large scale structure , bouncing solutions , etc .",
    "there are many open issues in @xmath25 gravity and cosmology .",
    "in particular , one may extend this class of theories by allowing for non - minimal couplings to matter , such as @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite theories , where here @xmath28 is the trace of stress - energy tensor , and study their constraints from local tests and cosmology @xcite , focusing on the perturbations @xcite .",
    "additionally , one may further explore the theoretical issues of the extra degrees of freedom of the theory and the different vierbein choices .      in this work",
    ", we briefly consider the generalized curvature - matter couplings in section [ extfr ] , by analysing interesting aspects and the phenomenology of the theory . in section [ hybridmp ] ,",
    "we present the recent and novel approach to modified theories of gravity that consists of adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian an @xmath21 term constructed _ a la _ palatini .",
    "we show that the theory can satisfy the solar system observational constraints even if the scalar field is very light , which is consistent with cosmological scales , in particular , with the late - time cosmic acceleration . in section [ dmhybridmp ]",
    ", we consider the generalized virial theorem in the scalar - tensor representation of the hybrid metric - palatini gravity , which can be an efficient tool in observationally testing the viability of this class of generalized gravity models .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath21 gravity , for simplicity , which has an appealing feature , namely , it combines mathematical simplicity and a fair amount of generality @xcite .",
    "the action is given by @xmath29 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath30 yields the field equations , given by @xmath31 where we have denoted @xmath32 , and the prime represents the derivative with respect to the scalar curvature .",
    "the matter energy - momentum tensor is defined as @xmath33    note that the ricci scalar is a dynamical degree of freedom , which is transparent from the trace equation given by @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) .",
    "this introduces a new light scalar degree of freedom , which consequently produces a late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "however , the light scalar strongly violates the solar system constraints and the way out of this problem is through the ` chameleon ' mechanism , i.e. , the scalar field becomes massive in the solar system .",
    "the approaches to @xmath21 gravity consist in the metric , palatini , and metric - affine formalisms ( and one may mention a fourth approach , i.e. , the hybrid metric - palatini formalism which will be explored below , in some detail ) .      we mention an interesting application in the palatini formalism , by considering the action @xcite : @xmath36=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}\\left[r+l_p^2 \\left(a r^2+r_{\\mu\\nu}r^{\\mu\\nu } \\right)\\right ] -\\frac{1}{16\\pi}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 represents the planck length squared , @xmath13 is a free parameter , @xmath39 is the electromagnetic field strength , @xmath3 is the space - time metric , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the connection @xmath43 is _ a priori _ independent of the metric ( palatini formalism ) and must be determined by the field equations .",
    "more specifically , it was found that the end state of black hole evaporation can be represented by non - singular and without event horizon stable solitonic remnants with masses of the order the planck scale .",
    "though these objects are locally indistinguishable from spherically symmetric , massive electric ( or magnetic ) charges , they turn out to be sourceless geons containing a wormhole generated by the electromagnetic field .",
    "the results were obtained by interpreting semiclassical corrections to einstein s theory in the first - order ( palatini ) formalism , which yields second - order equations and avoids the instabilities of the usual ( metric ) formulation of quadratic gravity .",
    "this construction has interesting applications .",
    "for instance , it has recently been suggested that einstein - rosen ( er ) bridges can be interpreted as maximally entangled states of two black holes that form a complex einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair @xcite , in the context of the firewall debate @xcite .",
    "this relationship has been dubbed as the @xmath44 correlation .",
    "the latter conjecture was also considered in the context of the quadratic palatini theory @xcite .",
    "an important result , which stems from the underlying assumptions about the geometry on which the theory is constructed , is the fact that all the charged solutions of the quadratic palatini theory possess a wormhole structure .",
    "the results show that spacetime may have a foam - like microstructure with wormholes generated by fluctuations of the quantum vacuum .",
    "this involves the spontaneous creation / annihilation of entangled particle - antiparticle pairs , existing in a maximally entangled state connected by a non - traversable wormhole .",
    "since the particles are produced from the vacuum and therefore exist in a singlet state , they are necessarily entangled with one another , which provides further support to the @xmath45 claim .",
    "furthermore , the collapse of a charged radiation fluid in a planck - suppressed quadratic extension of gr was also considered @xcite .",
    "exact analytical solutions were obtained that extend the charged vaidya - type solution of gr , which allows to explore in detail new physics at the planck scale .",
    "starting from minkowski space , it was found that the collapsing fluid generates wormholes supported by the electric field .",
    "the relevance of the findings in relation to the quantum foam structure of space - time and the meaning of curvature divergences in this theory was also discussed .",
    "the above analysis was extended in @xcite , where the physical significance of curvature divergences in this theory and the topology change issue was discussed .",
    "this supports the view that space - time could have a foam - like microstructure pervaded by wormholes generated by quantum gravitational effects .",

    "since galaxy clusters are `` dark '' matter dominated objects , the main contribution to their mass comes from the geometric mass @xmath158 , so that with a very good approximation we have @xmath159 . therefore the virial theorem immediately provides the following mass scaling relation @xmath160 this equation shows that the virial mass is proportional to the baryonic ( normal ) mass of the cluster , and that the ratio of the total mass and of baryonic mass is determined by a purely geometric quantity , the geometric radius @xmath148 .",
    "hence the geometric radius of the cluster can be determined from observations , once the virial and baryonic masses and the virial radius , respectively , are known .",
    "while dark gravity offers an alternative explanation to the standard cosmological model for the expansion history of the universe , it offers a paradigm for nature fundamentally distinct from dark energy models of cosmic acceleration , even those that perfectly mimic the same expansion history .",
    "it is fundamental to understand how one may differentiate these modified theories of gravity from dark energy models .",

    "tests from the solar system , large scale structure and lensing , as well as laboratory and space - based equivalence principle experiments , essentially restrict the range of allowed modified gravity models .    surveys such as the euclid space telescope , the square kilometre array ( ska ) radio telescope , the dark energy survey ( des ) , and the extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( eboss ) as part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss ) will provide new opportunities to test the different cosmological models . indeed , with the wealth of unprecedented high precision observational data that will become available by these upcoming and planned surveys , we are dawning in a golden age of cosmology , which offers a window into understanding the perplexing nature of the cosmic acceleration , dark matter and of gravity itself .",
