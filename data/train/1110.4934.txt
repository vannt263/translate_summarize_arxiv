    "the study of an open quantum system aims at understanding the underlying physical processes between a quantum system and the environment and at giving a correct account of the system noise due to the environment .",
    "conventional theories usually assume a weak system - environment interaction . this assumption is no longer valid for a controlled quantum system , where the control , as a part of the environment , strongly interacts with the system .",
    "quantum interference between the system and the control and decoherence environment can modify the noise in the quantum system .",
    "given the recent advances in the experimental ultrafast optical techniques , an accurate theory that captures such an quantum interference effect is needed in the regime @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the operation and decoherence times , respectively . also , the stringent error threshold requirement ( @xmath3 ) demanded by fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite is another motivation for a high precision theory for open quantum systems .",
    "the master equation ( me ) approach has been successful for markovian open quantum systems @xcite , where the dynamics of the system is history independent .",
    "for such a markovian system under a coherent control , the corresponding mes are equivalent to the optical bloch equations @xcite , where the control and dissipation terms are additive in the equations . however , for systems with a structured environment @xcite , e.g. photonic crystal materials @xcite and nanocavity systems @xcite , the dynamics are non - markovian and the optical bloch theory is inapplicable . in fact , because of the memory effect of these systems , interferences exist between the control and the environment and the validity of the additive form of the me is questionable .",
    "therefore , the challenge remains open in non - markovian systems .",
    "a precise diagrammatic technique has been formulated recently to solve the dynamics of a two level system ( tls ) under a time - dependent coherent photon control through the multimode jaynes - cummings ( jc ) interaction in the regime @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it takes into full account of the quantum interference among the tls , the control and the electromagnetic vacuum and is applicable for both markovian and non - markovian situations .",
    "the idea is to construct the time evolution of the tls in terms of a time loop propagation , in the same spirit as the keldysh non - equilibrium green s function technique @xcite . under this construction ,",
    "the underlying physical processes become transparent : dissipations originate from the contraction between photons at different times ; coherent rabi motions are due to propagators dressed by the control photons ; interferences between these two processes result in the control noise . for @xmath0 , only diagrams with a small number of contractions are important and they can be summed exactly , allowing a precise calculation of the controlled dynamics of the tls in this time domain within a given error bound .",
    "based on a simple non - markovian model , it has been shown that this diagrammatic formalism captured quantum correlations of the entire system that was missed in conventional me approximations even in the small time limit @xcite .",
    "the error of the me approximations is comparable to that of the classical approximation .",
    "this diagrammatic approach is not restricted to the case where the photon control is a glauber state .",
    "the control can formally be extended to an arbitrary photon state . to illustrate this",
    ", we extend the theory to the cases of a multimode squeezed coherent state and a multimode photon number state .",
    "comparisons with the single mode results indicate the accuracy of these diagrammatic solutions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_diagrammatic approach ] , we review the diagrammatic formalism for a tls under a coherent control and provide rules for the diagrammatic construction .",
    "section  [ sec_comparison ] performs an explicit comparison with the standard me approaches .",
    "we also demonstrate the ability of the diagrammatic approach to systematically improve the accuracy by including higher order diagrams .",
    "section   [ sec_non - coherent control ] extends the discussion to non - glauber photon controls .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the central idea of the diagrammatic technique is first to express the time evolution of the composite system in terms of the spin and photon operators , then to evaluate the transition matrix in terms of photon operators , which are finally treated diagrammatically using the wick s expansion .",
    "the problem of a time - dependent controlled tls is governed by the multimode jc hamiltonian under a multimode coherent state @xmath4 .",
    "consider first for simplicity , an initial wavefunction of the product form @xmath5|\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\rangle $ ] , where @xmath6 gives the spin state .",
    "the system evolves as @xmath7 , where the evolution operator in the interaction picture is given by : @xmath8 , \\label{eq - v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the multimode jc interaction is : @xmath9 with @xmath10 the energy splitting of the tls , @xmath11 the photon frequency and @xmath12 the tls - photon coupling strength .",
    "the interaction on the initial coherent photon state can be viewed as the action of a control pulse , consisting of a modulation of the resonant frequency mode with the coherent state amplitude satisfying : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the eigenvalue of @xmath15 on @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the envelope function and phase of the pulse , respectively .",
    "note that we have made the rotating wave approximation which is valid when @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the physical quantity of interest is the transformation matrix : @xmath20 from which we can obtain the reduced density matrix of the tls at that : @xmath21 it is straightforward to generalize the above formulae to an initial state which is a linear combination of the product states .",
    "in contrast to the me methodology which traces out the photonic environment in the beginning , we evaluate the tls transition by the spin operators in the transformation matrix first , leaving a sequence of the corresponding photon components .",
    "an example is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on this expression for illustration .",
    "other transformation matrices can be obtained similarly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the task is now reduced to compute expectation values of the photon operators for the initial multimode coherent state .",

    "the underlying physical processes can be easily identified using a diagrammatic representation as in fig .",
    "[ diagram0 ] .",
    "we shall see in the next subsection how different roles of the photons affect the interaction dynamics , and how this infinite series expression can be largely simplified and summed to a desirable accuracy using @xmath24 as a small parameter .",
    "no stochastic assumption has been made .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is fundamentally different from the me method which usually assumes a stationary environment and thus does not account for the interference effect between the control and the environment of a quantum system .",

    "( [ eq_infinite series ] ) can be computed easily by the replacement @xmath27 and @xmath28 for normal ordered photons .",
    "physically , the normal ordered photons coming from the multimode coherent state are responsible for the coherent rabi motion of the tls ; while the contraction between photons , being independent of the control , corresponds to vacuum relaxation of the tls .",
    "the diagrammatic structure consists of two ingredients : the contraction between photons and dressed lines due to the coherent control .",
    "the contraction function is given by : @xmath29 and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagram1]a . here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be on the same or opposite time lines .",

    "therefore , the wick s expansion in terms of contraction is automatically a perturbative series of the small parameter @xmath35 . on the other hand , the dressed lines lead to rabi oscillations of the tls and are given by @xcite : @xmath36 corresponding to the double and triple line depicted in fig .",

    "@xmath44 gives the area of the coherent pulse at time @xmath26 .",

    "[ diagram1]e .",
    "interference between the control ( dressed line ) and decoherence ( contraction line ) is evident .",
    "we stress that these diagrams are first order in decoherence , but infinite order in the coherent interaction .",
    "this explains why the diagrammatic approach is a suitable candidate to our control noise problem , in contrast to the me method that requires a weak system - environment coupling .",
    "the field theoretic approach described above is applicable for an arbitrary photon dos and thus valid for both the markovian and non - markovian systems . for a broadband dos ,",
    "the contraction function becomes a delta function @xmath50 , meaning that the two ends of a contraction line are squeezed to the same point . in this limit ,",
    "the correlation time @xmath51 is zero and the decoherence is linear in @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , corresponding to a markovian exponential decay .",
    "the dynamics of the controlled tls can be alternatively obtained by the optical bloch equation and the diagrammatic solution shows quantitative agreement with it in the regime @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "extension to the non - markovian regime can be performed simply by modifying the photon dos and thus the contraction function .",
