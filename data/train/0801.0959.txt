    "molecular recognition is the ability of a biomolecule to interact preferentially with a particular target molecule among a vast variety of different but almost identically looking rival molecules",
    ". examples of specific recognition processes comprise enzyme - substrate binding , antibody - antigen binding , protein - receptor interactions or cell - mediated recognition @xcite .",
    "molecular recognition is essential for biological systems such as the immune system to work efficiently .",
    "whereas macromolecules are held together by covalent bonds the recognition process is governed by specific non - covalent interactions such as ionic binding , the van der waals interaction , the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity @xcite . in an aqueous environment",
    "those non - covalent bonds contribute an energy of the order of 1 - 2 kcal / mole with the relatively strong hydrogen bonds sometimes contributing up to 8 - 10 kcal / mole @xcite .",
    "the non - covalent bonds are thus only slightly stronger than the thermal energy @xmath0 kcal / mole at physiological conditions and therefore the specificity of biomolecule recognition is only achieved if a large number of functional groups of the two molecules to recognise each other precisely match and thus a large number of non - covalent bonds can be formed @xcite .",
    "the binding sites of the two molecules are said to be complementary to each other .",
    "this view of molecular recognition for inflexible macromolecules is sometimes called `` lock - and - key '' mechanism @xcite",
    ". however there are notable recognition processes that involve flexible biomolecules @xcite .",
    "the matching of a large number of functional groups is then achieved by a conformational change giving rise to large entropic contributions ( so - called `` induced fit '' scheme ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to short - range interactions ensuring the stability of the complex for a sufficiently large time long - range electrostatic interactions are believed to pre - orient the biomolecules so that the probability of the contact of the complementary patches on the two molecules upon collision is increased @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the principles of recognition processes between biomolecules is not only important from a scientific point of view but also for biotechnological and biomedical applications .",
    "the knowledge of these principles is a necessary input for the design of synthetic heteropolymers with molecular recognition ability so that they can interact with a biological environment , i.e. biomolecules , cells and tissues , in a programmable way ( see e.g. the review by @xcite ) .    in recent years much effort",
    "has been spent to investigate the structural basis for the recognition of two rigid proteins @xcite .",
    "in particular the recognition sites of the two proteins in contact have been analysed .",
    "the recognition site on a protein basically consists of the residues , i.e. amino acids , which interact with residues of the other proteins .",
    "it is found to be made up of largely hydrophobic residues so that its hydrophobicity is comparable with that of the interior of the protein . for the development of idealised coarse - grained models it is therefore assumed that hydrophobicity plays a major role in recognition processes .",
    "consequently the residue interactions in the idealised models investigated in this article are assumed to be purely of hydrophobic nature .",
    "the investigation of the underlying mechanisms of molecular recognition processes from a physical point of view has recently gained growing interest .",
    "in particular the question of the specificity of recognition processes has been addressed by methods of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the view of specificity , which is basically the occurrence of a preferential binding of the recognition agents in the presence of a diversity of rival molecules , remains yet incomplete ( the introductory remarks in @xcite about the diversity of definitions of specificity found in the literature still apply ) .    in this article",
    "we develop coarse - grained lattice models for the investigation of the principles of molecular recognition processes .",
    "our approach , which is described in section [ kap : general ] , consists of two stages : in a first step a design of probe molecules is carried out .",
    "this step mimics the design in biotechnological applications or the evolution in nature . in a second step",
    "the recognition ability is calculated by considering the free energy of association of the probe molecules with the target and a structurally different rival molecule .",
    "this general approach is illustrated for a modified hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) model in section [ kap : hp ] . in section [ kap : coop ]",
    "the modified hp model is extended to take cooperative effects on a residue - specific level into account .",
    "the resulting model is investigated in its mean - field formulation and in the limiting case of dominant cooperativity which can be tackled analytically .",
    "in addition the model is investigated numerically for the case where the contributions of the direct residue - residue interactions and the indirect cooperative interactions are of same order .",
    "the findings are compared to the limiting case of dominating cooperativity and to the mean field findings . in section [ kap : alter_coop ] another possible way to incorporate cooperative effects is analysed .",
    "the article closes with a conclusion and an outlook ( section [ kap : conclusion ] ) . among other findings",
    "some of the numerical results have been published recently in a separate letter @xcite .",
    "in this article we study coarse - grained models for the recognition of two rigid proteins . under physiological conditions",
    "the complex of the proteins is stabilised by non - covalent interactions across its interface .",
    "the binding of the proteins is accompanied by a decrease of entropy due to immobilising translational , rotational and conformational degrees of freedom .",
    "the gain in energy on forming the complex has thus to be strong enough to overcome these entropic costs . in our model the proteins",
    "are considered to be rigid so that conformational changes of the backbone of the proteins need not be taken into account .",
    "this assumption is fulfilled for a large variety of real protein - protein associations , however , even for the association of two rigid proteins minor rearrangements of the side chains of the amino acids will occur ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the energetics at the contact interface of the complex can be formulated in a coarse - grained way where coarse - graining is adopted for both the structural properties of the recognition sites of the involved biomolecules and for the interaction between two residues @xcite .",
    "consider a recognition site of @xmath1 residues on both proteins . for simplicity",
    "it is assumed that the two recognition sites contain the same number of residues and that precisely two residues match respectively in the interface .",
    "notice that a recognition site found in natural protein - protein complexes contains typically of the order of @xmath2 residues @xcite .",
    "the chemical structure of the recognition site of the protein to be recognised , which is called _ target _ molecule in the following , is characterised in a coarse - grained approach by a discrete variable @xmath3 where the value of @xmath4 specifies the type of the residue at positions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , on the recognition site .",
    "similarly , the types of the residues of the recognition site of the other protein which recognises the target are specified by a second variable @xmath7 . in the following this second biomolecule",
    "is called _ probe _ molecule . on a coarse - grained level ,",
    "the interaction of the functional groups across the interface is described by a hamiltonian @xmath8 where we incorporate an additional interaction variable @xmath9 .",
    "the variable @xmath10 takes the quality of the contact of the residues of the two proteins at position @xmath5 into account , where a good contact leads to a favourable contribution to binding and a bad one only to a small contribution .",
    "a good contact may imply , for example , that the distance between the two residues is small or the polar moments of residues are appropriately aligned to each other . a steric hindrance on the other hand may result in a large distance between the residues and consequently one has a bad contact .",
    "the variable @xmath11 therefore models effects that are related to minor rearrangements of the side - chains of the amino acids when the two proteins form a complex .    along",
    "these general lines a first model , namely a modification of the hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) model , can be formulated . in the hp - model",
    "only two different types of residues are distinguished , namely hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) , i.e. hydrophilic , ones , so that the variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 specify the degree of hydrophobicity of the residues .",
    "this restriction to the hydrophobic interaction is motivated by the observation that the hydrophobicity is a major property that discriminates the recognition site from other patches on the surface of a protein .",
    "hydrophobic residues are described by the variable @xmath14 and polar residues by @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath16 where the sum extents over the @xmath1 positions of the residues of the recognition site and the interaction constant @xmath17 is positive .",
    "it is typically of the order of @xmath18 kcal / mole for hydrophobic interactions @xcite .",
    "the product @xmath19 describes the mutual interaction of the residues in contact across the interface .",
    "the additional variable @xmath10 can take on the values @xmath20 .",
    "thus for @xmath21 one has a good contact leading to a non - zero contribution to the total interaction energy , for @xmath22 , on the other hand , one has a bad contact and no energy contribution .",
    "notice that a good contact not necessarily leads to a favourable energy contribution .",
    "note also that the original hp - model , which has been introduced to study the protein folding problem @xcite , does not contain an additional variable @xmath11 to model the quality of the contact .",
    "the grouping of the 20 natural amino acids into classes of characteristic types is very important for the development of minimal models for the study of protein interactions .",
    "the reduction to a hydrophobic and a polar type and thus the use of an ising - like model hamiltonian such as ( [ eq : hp - hamiltonian ] ) on a coarse - grained level is also justified by the findings in @xcite . in this work li et al .",
    "applied an eigenvalue decomposition to the miyazawa - jernigan matrix of inter - residue contact energies of amino acids .",
    "they found that the interaction matrix can be parameterised by an ising - like model where the `` spin variable '' can take on different discrete values .",
    "as these values show a bimodal distribution the reparameterisation basically reduces to the ising model where the two possible values of the `` spins '' describe hydrophobic and polar residues . introducing the additional variable @xmath11 for the rearrangement of the amino acid side chains we end up with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hp - hamiltonian ] ) . suggested by experimental observations the grouping of the amino acids into five characteristic groups",
    "is also widely discussed @xcite .",
    "the reduction in @xcite , for example , uses a distance - based clustering applied to the miyazawa - jernigan matrix .",
    "the resulting grouping reproduces the statistical and kinetic features of well - designed sequences in the protein - folding problem .",
    "the grouping into five different characteristic types in these approaches points at possible extensions of our model for the contact interaction . in this work , however , we restrict ourselves only to hydrophic and polar residue types .    to study the recognition process between the two biomolecules we adopt a two - stage approach .",
    "first the structure of the recognition site of the target molecule is fixed to a certain sequence @xmath23 of residues .",
    "then this structure is learned by the probe with respect to some learning rules under conditions that are specified by a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to an ensemble of probe molecules of sequences @xmath13 at their recognition sites with a probability @xmath25 depending on the initially fixed target structure . to illustrate this a bit",
    "further consider a design step where learning is done just by thermal equilibration .",
    "the probability distribution is then technically given by the canonical boltzmann distribution @xmath26 where the normalisation @xmath27 is the usual canonical partition function .",
    "the design temperature @xmath28 acts as a lagrange multiplier that fixes the average energy , however , the parameter @xmath28 may also be interpreted to describe more generally the conditions under which the design has been carried out .",
    "this first design step is introduced to mimic the design in biotechnological applications or the process of evolution in nature @xcite .",
    "note that in some studies of the protein folding problem @xcite and the adsorption of polymers on structured surfaces @xcite a similar design step has been incorporated .    in the second step",
    "the recognition ability of the designed probe ensemble of structures @xmath13 is tested . to this end",
    "the ensemble is brought into interaction with both the picked target structure @xmath29 and a competing ( different ) structure @xmath30 at some inverse temperature @xmath31 which in general is different from the design temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the free energy of the probe system interacting with the structure @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermal free energy for the interaction between @xmath33 and a fixed probe sequence @xmath13 and an average over the structures in the probe ensemble is carried out .",
    "the free energy @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the target with the structure @xmath29 at its recognition site is recognised by the probe if the associated free energy @xmath38 is lower than the free energy @xmath39 for the interaction with the competing structure @xmath30 , i.e. in a mixture of equally many @xmath29 and @xmath30 molecules the probe molecules preferentially bind to the original target .",
    "this is signalled by a negative free energy difference @xmath40 .",
    "thus the specificity of the recognition process is related to the difference between the free energy of association for the competing molecules . for given structures @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath30 one can introduce a suitable measure @xmath41 for the structural similarity of the target and the rival biomolecule . carrying out an average over all target and rival structures that are compatible with the specified similarity @xmath41 one",
    "can compute the averaged free energy difference of association @xmath42 as a function of the similarity between the target and the rival and therefore investigate the overall recognition ability of the model ( see section [ kap : hp ] below for the hp - model ) .",
    "note that in our approach the mechanism which brings the two interacting molecules , in particular the two recognition sites , into contact is not taken into account , i.e. , only equilibrium aspects are considered .    in principle interactions of the residues which do not belong to the recognition sites with solvent molecules have to be considered as well .",
    "solvation effects at the recognition sites and the associated entropy changes are also important for the association process of biomolecules @xcite . in the coarse - grained model , however , it is assumed that all these contributions are of the same size for all proteins under consideration .",
    "note also that solvation effects are already partially contained in hp - models .",
    "in addition the entropic contributions due to a reduction of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom upon forming a complex can be assumed to cancel out in the free energy difference @xmath43 in a first approximation .",
    "this requires at least that the two competing proteins are of comparable shape and size .    in this work",
    "we assume that the proteins have the same number of residues at the interface . however , many protein - protein interfaces are curved with different numbers of residues on the two proteins @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our assumption not to be crucial within the above simplified coarse - grained view , at least in a first approximation .",
    "as our model characterises the residues only with respect to their hydrophobicity one can partition the interface into @xmath1 contacts and attribute hydrophobicities to the patches on the two proteins that contribute to a particular contact .",
    "then one ends up again with our hamiltonian ( [ eq : hp - hamiltonian ] ) . for approaches where the residue type is determined by additional features apart",
    "form hydrophobicity correlations between neighbouring patches might occur so that our assumption may become questionable .",
    "the modified hp - model of the previous section , can again serve as an illustration of the two - state approach for investigating molecular recognition processes . as ( [ eq : hp - hamiltonian ] )",
    "does not involve any interaction between neighbouring residues of the recognition site of a protein , the two - stage approach can be worked out exactly .",

    "the design temperature @xmath32 may be interpreted to characterise the conditions under which the design has been carried out .",
    "this can be illustrated using the present example of the hp - model . in the hp - model",
    "the value of @xmath4 or @xmath45 , respectively , basically specifies the hydrophobicity of the residue at position @xmath5 .",
    "the total hydrophobicity of the recognition site of the target molecule is then @xmath46 . from relation ( [ eq : hp_model_design ] ) one can calculate the average hydrophobicity @xmath47 of probe structures:@xmath48 thus the lagrange parameter @xmath32 can be used to fix the average hydrophobicity of the designed probe ensemble which is achieved by controlling the supply of hydrophobic residues during the design procedure .    the probability distribution ( [ eq : hp_model_design ] ) for the designed structures @xmath13 explicitly depends on the structure @xmath29 of the recognition site of the fixed target molecule .",
    "for the hp - model a design under ideal conditions , i.e. @xmath49 , the structure @xmath13 would simply be a copy of @xmath29 .",

    "a value @xmath54 close to @xmath1 means a high complementarity and the interaction of the probe structure @xmath13 with @xmath55 can lead to a large enough energy decrease so that a complex can be formed . on the other hand a value of @xmath54 much less than @xmath1 signals a poor match between the two recognition sites and",
    "therefore it is unlikely that a complex is stabilised .",

    "cooperative effects play an essential role in many biological processes such as the catalysis of biochemical reactions by enzymes .",
    "cooperativity is presumably also very important for molecular recognition processes @xcite . in general cooperativity",
    "means that the binding strength of two residues depends on the binding interactions in the neighbourhood of the two residues in contact .",
    "thus the energetic properties of residues when interacting with other residues can not be inferred by considering them isolated from the local environment .",
    "this has implicitly been done , however , in the modified hp model ( [ eq : hp - hamiltonian ] ) where the interaction constant @xmath17 has been attributed to the residue - residue interaction independently of the corresponding local environment .    in this section the modified hp - model of the preceeding section",
    "is extended to incorporate the effect of cooperative interactions on molecular recognition .",
    "note that in reference @xcite it has been argued that cooperativity should be incorporated on a residue - specific level .    during the association process rearrangements of the amino acid side chains are observed .",

    "if a hydrophobic residue gets adsorbed at the corresponding position of the probe structure a good contact with @xmath65 is favoured by the hydrophobic interaction term in ( [ eq : hp - coop ] ) .",
    "but then the second cooperative term leads to an additional energy decrease for @xmath66 .",
    "if on the other hand a polar residue shows up at the position @xmath64 on the probe molecule the hydrophobic contribution in ( [ eq : hp - coop ] ) tries to avoid a contact , i.e. @xmath67 , on average , which then leads to an unfavourable energy increase due to the cooperative term .",
    "the quality of a contact thus couples to the quality of the contacts in the neighbourhood of a residue . for a positive constant @xmath62 the cooperativity",
    "is therefore expected to enhance the fit of the molecules at the interface resulting in an increased average complementarity compared to an interaction without cooperativity .",
    "similarly , one expects an increase in the recognition specificity . in the subsequent paragraphs these suggestions",
    "are investigated for cooperative interactions .",
    "note that @xmath45 ( and thus the product @xmath68 ) in hamiltonian ( [ eq : hp - coop ] ) is a random variable whose distribution is obtained by the design step .",
