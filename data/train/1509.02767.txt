    "the basic idea in the new nlo - improved perturbative qcd + saturation + viscous hydro event - by - event ekrt framework @xcite presented in this talk , is as follows : using collinear factorization and nlo pqcd , we first compute the production of transverse energy ( @xmath7 ) carried by partons of @xmath8 few gev ( minijets ) into the central region in @xmath9+@xmath9 collisions . the conjecture of gluon saturation , implemented as in the nlo - extension @xcite of the original ekrt paper @xcite , then allows us to compute qcd - matter initial conditions , ebye , for viscous hydrodynamics with which we describe the space - time evolution of the produced qcd matter .",
    "comparing with a multitude of experimental rhic and lhc data for low-@xmath0 observables , we aim at _ ( i ) _ pinning down the @xmath2 ratio , _",
    "( ii ) _ testing our initial state calculation , and _ ( iii ) _ studying the applicability region of viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "using collinear factorization , nlo minijet @xmath7 production per transverse area into a rapidity interval @xmath10 in high - energy @xmath9+@xmath9 collisions of impact parameter @xmath11 can be computed as @xmath12 where the collision geometry is given by the the standard nuclear thickness functions @xmath13 .",
    "the minijet part @xcite , which in nlo @xcite can be written as @xmath14}_n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma^{2\\rightarrow n}}{\\mathrm{d[ps]}_n}\\tilde{\\mathcal{s}}_n,\\ ] ] contains phase - space integrated @xmath15 and @xmath16 differential @xmath17 partonic cross sections @xmath18}_{n}$ ] , obtained in terms of uv - renormalized squared matrix elements @xcite , and cteq6 m @xcite parton distribution functions with eps09s spatially dependent nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "the measurement functions , @xmath19 contain step functions @xmath20 and are analogous to those in jet production @xcite .",
    "they define the 1 ) minijet @xmath7 as the sum of the minijet @xmath0 s in @xmath10 ; 2 ) @xmath0 cut - off scale @xmath21 above which we do the minijet calculation , and 3 ) minimum @xmath7 that we might require in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "such @xmath22 ensure a well - defined nlo calculation safe from collinear and infra - red singularities . with these ingredients ,",
    "the minijet @xmath7 calculation is field - theoretically rigorous for fixed @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "as the @xmath7 here is not a direct observable , we must leave the parameter @xmath25 to be fixed from experimental data .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 controlling minijet production is here fixed based on a gluon saturation conjecture . as argued in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath7 production is expected to cease ( saturate ) when @xmath26 and higher order processes become of the same magnitude as the basic @xmath15 ones , @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to a saturation criterion analogous to that in the original ekrt - model @xcite but now for an ir / cl - safe @xmath7 , @xmath28 from which @xmath29 is solved locally in * r * and for fixed @xmath30 .",
    "the `` packing factor '' , proportionality constant @xmath31 , is to be fixed from the data .",
    "the key observation @xcite enabling the ebye framework here , is that @xmath32 scales essentially as @xmath33^n$ ] , so that we can parametrize @xmath34 vs. @xmath30 .",
    "the parametrization , intended also for public use , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the minimum @xmath35 we allow here is 1 gev .",
    "for the ebye set - up , we first sample the nucleon positions in the colliding nuclei from the standard two - parameter woods - saxon density . around each nucleon",
    ", we then set a gluon transverse density , @xmath36 , whose width parameter , @xmath37  fm is obtained from the exclusive electroproduction data of @xmath38 at hera / zeus @xcite .",
    "after this the thickness functions @xmath39 of the nuclei can be computed , and @xmath40 obtained for fixed @xmath30 on the basis of the nlo pqcd+saturation calculation described above . from @xmath35 , we then extract the local formation time , @xmath41 , and energy density @xmath42 ^ 4\\ ] ] of the minijet plasma .",
    "`` pre - thermal '' evolution from @xmath43 to @xmath44  fm is here done simply with 1 d bjorken hydro ( also free streaming would work @xcite ) . at the edges of the collision system , below @xmath45 gev , we connect the @xmath46-profile smoothly to a binary profile ( see @xcite ) .    with such ebye initial conditions",
    ", we then run 2 + 1 d viscous hydrodynamics , ebye .",
    "our hydro setup is the one used in @xcite , i.e. 2nd - order dissipative relativistic hydro with transient fluid - dynamics equation of motion for the shear - stress tensor @xmath47 @xcite ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "we neglect heat conductivity and bulk viscosity and study the effects of shear viscosity only .",
    "we explore the possible temperature dependence of @xmath2 with the parametrizations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etapers ] .    .",
    "from @xcite.,width=275 ]    as the qcd - matter equation of state , we employ the @xmath48-pce - v1 parametrization @xcite with chemical decoupling at a rather high temperature of 175 mev , and kinetic freeze - out at 100 mev .",
    "resonance decays after the freeze - out are included .",
    "the initial @xmath49 and transverse flow @xmath50 are set to zero . in the non - equilibrium particle distributions on the freeze - out surface ,",
    "we assume , as usual , that the relative deviations from the equilibrium distributions are proportional to @xmath51 for each particle species .",
    "let us then consider selected results from the extensive multi - energy and multi - observable analysis of ref .",
    "figure [ fig : lhc_rhic_data ] shows the centrality dependence of the computed charged hadron multiplicity @xmath52 and their flow coefficients @xmath53 from the 2-particle cumulants at the lhc and @xmath54 at rhic , and comparison with the data . for details ,",
    "definitions of these quantities , and @xmath0 spectra , see @xcite . for each @xmath2 parametrization , and setting @xmath55 @xcite , we exploit only the centralmost lhc multiplicity datapoint to fix the normalization with @xmath31 . the good agreement with the data",
    "indicates that our initial states are on the average working well .",
    "all the @xmath2 parametrizations of fig .",

    "our ebye framework catches remarkably well the centrality systematics of the measured @xmath58 , and also proves that since @xmath59 and @xmath60 are _ nonlinearly correlated _ in non - central collisions , hydrodynamics ( collectivity ) is indeed required to reproduce the measured @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath58 offer direct constraints for the initial state in that they are _ insensitive _ to @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ fig : eventplane_correlation2 ] shows examples of correlations of two and three event - plane angles , @xmath62 at the lhc .",
    "especially since the @xmath58 now constrain our initial state calculation independently of @xmath61 , these correlations give vital further constraints for the viscosity and for the validity of the ebye viscous framework .",
    "remarkably , the same two @xmath2 parametrizations that explain the rhic @xmath1 s ( black and blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : etapers ] ) work best also at the lhc ! importantly , as the rightmost panel shows , for these cases also the @xmath63 corrections remain conveniently small from central to semicentral collisions , suggesting that the obtained hydrodynamic results appear trustworthy up to 40 - 50% centrality classes . for more data and discussion ,",
    "consult again ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "performing a simultaneous lhc and rhic multi - observable analysis , we have shown that the new nlo - improved ebye ekrt framework explains remarkably consistently the lhc and rhic bulk observables in urhic .",
    "the framework has clear predictive power in cms - energy and centrality , and it is a promising tool for getting a controlled estimate of the @xmath64-dependence of the qcd matter shear viscosity , now that enough orthogonal data constraints start to be available .",
    "our results favor a qcd - matter @xmath2 which is between a constant value 0.2 and a modestly decreasing(increasing ) in the hadron gas(qgp ) phase .",
    "similar magnitudes have been obtained also for constant @xmath61 by other groups @xcite .",
    "next , we need a genuine global analysis to extract true statistical error limits to @xmath2 .",
    "also the effects of bulk viscosity @xcite should be studied .",
    "work for the ekrt ebye framework predictions for the forthcoming 5 tev pb+pb run at the lhc is in progress .",
