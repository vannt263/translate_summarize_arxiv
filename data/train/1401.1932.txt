    "the field of quantum metrology has been developed to study the ultimate limit of precision in estimating a physical quantity , when quantum strategies are exploited @xcite .",
    "classically , for a given measurement scheme , the effect of statistical errors can be reduced by repeating the same measurement and averaging the outcomes .",
    "explicitly , by repeating the same independent measurements @xmath2 times , the uncertainty about the measured parameter @xmath3 will be reduced to the standard quantum limit @xmath4 . however ,",
    "if squeezed or entangled states are used as probe systems which undergo an evolution that depends on the parameters to be estimated , the precision can be enhanced and the uncertainty can approach the heisenberg limit @xmath5 which beats the standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the sensitivity of the detectors in the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) approaches the heisenberg limit by using squeezed states of light @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum entanglement plays an important role in open questions such as the information loss problem of black holes and many authors have recently recently studied how relativistic effects might affect entanglement , classical and quantum discord as well as quantum nonlocality @xcite in a relativistic frame .",
    "most recently , the study of quantum metrology has been applied to the area of relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "it was shown that quantum metrology methods can be exploited to improve probing technologies of unruh - hawking effect @xcite and gravitation @xcite .",
    "it was found that quantum metrology can be employed to estimate the unruh temperature of a moving cavity at experimental reachable acceleration  @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results are of great importance for the observation of relativistic effects in a laboratory @xcite and space - based quantum information processing tasks @xcite .    to obtain a better understanding of the application of quantum metrology to relativistic settings , it is interesting to extend the studies to curved frameworks .",
    "we notice that the quantum metrology for scalar fields in a relativistic frame has been the focus of research @xcite , but such technology has not yet been applied to quantum parameter estimation for fermionic fields .",
    "it is well known that neutrinos are one kind of fermions and the time - evolution of a neutrino in an expanding universe can be described by dirac equation . in the standard cosmology model , relic neutrinos act as witnesses and participants for landmark events in the history of the universe from the era of big - bang nucleosynthesis to the era of large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the behavior of fermions , especially the neutrinos is crucial for estimating the age of our universe and its fate .",
    "we also notice that the neutrinos are usually considered as spin @xmath6 fermions while the spinless neutrinos is only discussed in few articles such as @xcite . here",
    "we study the massive dirac field without the consideration of spin therefore can not model the neutrinos directly .",
    "but the model in this paper can in principle be applied to the study of spin @xmath6 fermion @xcite in the robertson - walker universe as well . besides , the estimation of the expansion of the universe is significant to understand the source and mechanisms of primary particle production .    in this paper",
    ", we apply techniques from quantum metrology to estimate the expansion rate of the universe in the two - dimensional conformally flat robertson - walker ( rw ) metric @xcite for dirac fields . the interplay between the expansion of the universe and entanglement in this context",
    "was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite both for scalar and dirac fields . it was found that a single qubit initially in its vacuum state evolves to an entangled state in the particle number degree of freedom in the expanding universe .",
    "we will analytically calculate the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite in terms of the dimensionless mass @xmath0 and the dimensionless wave vector @xmath1 of the dirac fields , where the classical expanding universe constitutes the unitary channel . by applying a quantum metrology strategy on the final states",
    ", the precision of the estimated parameter can be related to the qfi .",
    "such procedure corresponds to finding the set of measurements that allows us to estimate the parameter with the highest precision . at the same time",
    ", information about the history of the expanding universe can be extracted from measurements on the states in the asymptotic future region , while the ultimate precision limit is related to the qfi .",
    "we then find that the precision of the estimation can be improved by choosing the projective measurements corresponding to eigenvectors of the particle states with some certain masses and momentums .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time that the quantum metrology is studied in the cosmological background .",
    "our work opens a new way for the improvement of quantum estimation technologies for cosmological parameters in an expanding universe .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the quantization of dirac fields in the rw spacetime . in sec .",
    "iii some concepts for quantum metrology are presented , in particular the qfi . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the qfi and seek the best proposal for the cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "in this paper we study fermions for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , quantum metrology strategies for scalar fields in a relativistic frame have been the focus of research in refs .",
    "@xcite , while quantum parameter estimation for the fermionic field has not been discussed .",
    "secondly , the cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath7b ) was produced approximately 1 second after the big bang and permeates the present day universe @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the sense that both of them are relic distributions created after the big bang .",
    "however , differently from the cmb that formed after the universe was approximately four hundred thousand years old , the c@xmath7b formed only about one second after the big bang @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the behavior of fermions , especially the relic neutrinos is crucial for understanding the inflationary phase of the universe and the estimating the age of our universe . for more details",
    "please see ref .",

    "to quantize dirac fields in the rw spacetime @xcite , we introduce the local tetrad field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are metrics of the rw spacetime and minkowski spacetime , respectively . the covariant dirac equation for field @xmath11 with mass @xmath12 in a curved background reads@xcite @xmath13 where the curvature - dependent dirac matrices @xmath14 relate to flat ones through @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the flat - space dirac matrices that satisfies @xmath17 . here",

    "the system is entangled by gravity during the expanding and the information about the volume ratio @xmath26 is codified in the final state .",
    "the aim of quantum metrology is to determine the value of a parameter with higher precision than classical approaches , by using entanglement and other quantum resources @xcite .",
    "a key concept for quantum metrology is the quantum fisher information @xcite , which relates with a measurement outcome @xmath71 of a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) @xmath72 and takes the form of @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability with respect to a chosen povm and the corresponding measurement result @xmath71 , and @xmath26 is the parameter to be estimated .",
    "according to the classical cramr - rao inequality @xcite , the mean square fluctuation of the unbiased error for @xmath26 is @xmath75 furthermore , the fisher information is @xmath76 for @xmath2 repeated trials of measurement , which leads to cramr - rao bound(crb ) on the phase uncertainty , @xmath77 which gives the maximum precision in @xmath26 for a _ particular _ measurement scheme .",

    "although now we have a concise definition of qfi , the calculation of @xmath86 is somewhat not easy .",

    ", the qfi can be expressed as @xcite @xmath91 where the summations involve sums over all @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . from eq .",
    ", we can see that the qfi for a non - full - rank quantum state can be calculated by the spectrum decomposition of its density matrix with nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "our aim is to study how precisely one can in principle estimate the cosmological parameters that appear in the expansion of universe .",
    "specifically , we will estimate the volume ratio @xmath26 of the universe based on the quantum cram@xmath94r - rao inequality @xcite .",
    "thus we should at first calculate the operational qfi in terms of the bogoliubov coefficients which encode in the estimated parameter .",
    "the reduced density matrix corresponding to particle states of fixed momentum @xmath1 is found to be @xmath95 which is obtained after tracing out the antiparticle modes @xmath96 and all other modes with different @xmath97 since all modes decouple during the evolution of spacetime except for modes with opposite momenta @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "assuming that now we live in the universe that corresponds to the asymptotic future of the spacetime , we can estimate the volume ratio of the expanding universe by taking measurements on the particle state eq .",
    "( [ pof ] ) .",
    "generally , an estimation scheme can be performed in three steps : probe preparations , evolution of the probes in the dynamic system , and measure the probes after the evolution @xcite . in this system , the state between the created fermions and anti - fermions act as the probe . for different positive operator valued measurements",
    "( povm ) @xmath98 , different values of fisher information can be obtained .",
    "the aim of this paper is looking for highest precision for the estimation .",
    "then we should find the optimal estimation scheme , i.e. finding the optimal povm that allows us to get the largest fisher information , i.e. , the qfi . now",
    "our main task is to find the optimal estimation strategy , i.e. finding an optimal measurement obtaining the qfi . in this paper the eigenvector @xmath99 of the final state eq.(7 )",
    "is easily to be calculated .",
    "then the projective measurement can be constituted by the eigenvectors @xmath99 of the final state and the measured probabilities @xmath100 are exactly the eigenvalues @xmath101 of the final state . the symmetric logarithmic derivative operator @xmath86 for the parameter @xmath26 is @xmath102 ^ 2 + \\frac{1+|\\gamma_{\\tilde{k}}^{f}\\chi_{\\tilde{k}}|^{2}}{|\\gamma_{\\tilde{k}}^{f\\ast}\\chi_{\\tilde{k}}|^{2 } } [ \\partial_{\\epsilon}(\\frac{|\\gamma_{\\tilde{k}}^{f\\ast}\\chi_{\\tilde{k}}|^{2 } } { 1+|\\gamma_{\\tilde{k}}^{f}\\chi_{\\tilde{k}}|^{2}})]^2,\\label{eqpofq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we can see that the expanding parameter @xmath26 is involved in the expression of qfi .",
    "it is worth mentioning that particles are created by the expansion of spacetime even if initially the field was in its vacuum state .",
    "pairs of entangled particles with opposite momentum @xmath1 are produced .",
    "we can exploit these particles for our purposes . in some extreme cases , for example when @xmath103 and @xmath104 , equation ( 8) becomes @xmath105 and the qfi vanishes because the partial derivatives @xmath106 and @xmath107 equal to zero . in other words , the quantum parameter estimation has the lowest precision when @xmath104 .     in the estimation of the volume ratio @xmath26 of the universe over the dimensionless mass @xmath0 of the dirac particles .",

    "the adjustable parameters in the probe state eq.(16 ) are the dimensionless mass @xmath0 and the dimensionless momentum @xmath1 of the particle and antiparticles .",
    "finally , we proceed to compute the error bounds which are our main quantity of interest .",
    "the optimal bound for the error in the estimation process can be calculated by using eqs .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) we plot the optimal bound @xmath110 in the estimation of the volume ratio @xmath26 as a function of dimensionless mass @xmath0 of the dirac fields .",

    "it is shown that the optimal bounds behave almost the same when we estimate @xmath26 .",
    "it is also shown that the bounds become very small ( the order of magnitude @xmath111 ) as the measurements are repeated many times on the medium weight dirac fields .",
    "for the weight dirac fields the bounds return to the order of magnitude @xmath112 again.we find that there is a finite range of masses that allows for a better estimation of the volume ratio . thus one can find a method for obtaining the lowest bound by choosing the final projection operator to be on the eigenvectors of the particle states with a chosen mass , determined by the desired outcome . in this way",
    ", one can improve the quantum estimation technologies for the volume ratio @xmath26 in an expanding universe .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) we also plot the qfi ( dashed red line ) of the dirac fields in the expanding universe as a function of dimensionless mass @xmath0 for fixed @xmath108 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in fig .",
    "@xcite , the behaviour of entanglement for dirac fields is very similar with the behaviour of qfi in this paper .",
    "then we arrive to a conclusion that the precision of the estimation of parameters in the expanding universe will be improved from the increase of quantum entanglement .",
    "this conclusion corroborate that the precision of quantum parameter estimation can be enhanced if squeezed or entangled states are used as probe systems .",

    "the minimum bound is obtained by numerical optimization over @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown that the bond @xmath110 deceases at first and then increase as the increasing @xmath1 , which means that the minimum possible bound for the estimation of the volume ratio @xmath26 can be find for some optimal @xmath1 . in other words , one can get the highest precision by choosing some fermions with some certain @xmath1 in the quantum measuring process .",
    "we studied cosmological quantum metrology by incorporating the effect of universe expansion in quantum parameter estimation .",
    "it is shown that the expanding spacetime background changes the value of qfi . at the same time , information about the history of the expanding universe can be extracted from measurements on quantum states in the asymptotic future region . we show that the optimal precision of the estimations depend sensitively on the dimensionless mass @xmath0 and dimensionless momentum @xmath1 of the dirac particles .",
