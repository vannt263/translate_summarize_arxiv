    "dis reactions are characterized by excitation of nucleon resonances ; while at high virtuality such processes have a partonic description .",
    "the smooth high - energy scaling curve essentially reproduces the average of the resonance peaks seen at low energies .",
    "burkert and ioffe [ 6 ] indicated that the contribution of the isobar @xmath105 electroproduction at small @xmath8 can describe the general gdh sum rule , and they gave        our results in fig.3 indicates the slope of the twist coefficient @xmath108 in eq .",

    "it implies that the correlation among partons become stronger at scale @xmath110 .",
    "we noted that petronzio1 , simula and ricco [ 22 ] reported that the inelastic proton data obtained at jefferson lab exhibit a possible extended objects with size of @xmath111 inside the proton .    as we have shown that the twist @xmath112 corrections are neglected at low @xmath8 .",
    "this supports our generalized leading order ( glo ) approximation [ 13,16 ] : if the lower order contributions are compatible with the experimental data at low @xmath8 , one can image that the higher order corrections are cancelable each other .    in summary",
    ", we assume that the parton distributions are still available at @xmath113 . using the dglap equation with the parton recombination corrections ,",
    "we indicate that the contributions of @xmath8-dependent parton distributions to the lowest moment of the spin - dependent proton structure function are almost constant in full @xmath8 range .",
    "in the meantime , the contributions of a vmd - type nonperturbative part are isolated . after removing the above two contributions from the existing experimental data for @xmath0 , the higher twist power corrections present their interesting characters : parton correlations at @xmath109 and @xmath114 show two bend points , where the twist-4 effect dominates the suppression of @xmath0 at @xmath2 , while the twist-6 effect arises a dramatic change of @xmath0 at @xmath3 . within the analytic of these results , we are able to achieve a rather good description of the data at all @xmath8 values using a simple parameterized form of @xmath0 .",
