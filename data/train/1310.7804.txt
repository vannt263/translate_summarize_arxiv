    "the inset enlarges the low - temperature regime on a logarithmic temperature scale.,width=283 ]    at the same time the linewidth exhibits three temperature regimes with different behavior as one can see in the lower frame of fig  [ tempx0 ] . at all orientations of the magnetic field",
    "the linewidth is only weakly temperature dependent between 50  k and 150  k. it increases following an arrhenius law @xmath30 with @xmath31  k for high temperatures @xmath32  k. to low temperatures , for @xmath33  k the linewidth diverges on approaching magnetic order as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .    concerning the high - temperature behavior , a similar activated process has been observed for other low - dimensional magnets with jahn - teller active ions and spin @xmath36.@xcite the activation energy @xmath31  k is larger than the vibrational eigenfrequencies and , therefore , an orbach process can be excluded .",
    "however , an energy barrier of similar size has been reported for the systems sr@xmath0vo@xmath1@xcite and cusb@xmath0o@xmath37.@xcite for the latter compound it has been proposed that the relaxation might take place via an excited state of a competing jahn - teller distortion,@xcite because there the activated behavior appears at temperatures just below a structural phase transition from a monoclinic into a tetragonal high - temperature phase .",
    "this phase transition of cusb@xmath0o@xmath37 at about 400  k can be understood as a thermally induced averaging process between two possible elongation directions of the cuo@xmath37 octahedra .",
    "but , such a structural phase transition has been observed neither in sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 nor in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 so far .",
    "thus , more systematic investigations are necessary to clarify this high - temperature behavior .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of such spin - lattice type relaxation phenomena is beyond the scope of the present study , where we focus on spin - spin relaxation mechanisms in the low- and intermediate temperature range .    turning to the critical divergence at low temperatures we have to remind that , although this exponent is in the range of the expected values for three - dimensional magnets close to magnetic order,@xcite it is obtained from a fit of a wide temperature range above @xmath11  k and should be interpreted with great care , because the validity of critical exponents is usually restricted to a narrow temperature regime close to @xmath14 . below",
    "we will show that the observed temperature dependence of the linewidth can be described by modeling a one - dimensional spin-1/2 chain in the presence of a uniform dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .    to reach this goal ,",
    "we first will focus on the intermediate regime , where @xmath38 , i.e. in this temperature range the linewidth can be treated in the high - temperature limit of the theory of exchange narrowing,@xcite where the linewidth is broadened by pure spin - spin relaxation , but not yet by additional thermally activated processes .",
    "we will illustrate that in this temperature range the angular dependence of the linewidth gives precise information on the dm interaction .",

    "the anisotropic exchange interactions are usually dominant as compared to the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "a similar situation is realized in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 as well .",
    "following conventional estimations,@xcite the contribution to the linewidth related to the dipole - dipole interaction is about @xmath54  oe only , because the distance between nearest neighbor cu - ions is quite large ( 6.3  ).@xcite an interesting specific feature of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 , which was not pointed out in previous studies , is that in the unit cell there are two magnetically nonequivalent positions on neighboring chains .",
    "therefore , we additionally investigated the contribution to the linewidth due to the anisotropic zeeman interaction .",
    "the detailed theoretical analysis is described in appendix a. moreover , the presence of this additional broadening mechanism of the esr line is confirmed by measurements at higher frequency ( i.e. q - band , 34  ghz ) . at x - band frequency ( 9.36 ghz )",
    "its contribution is relatively small and thus negligible .",
    "therefore , we turn again to the anisotropic exchange contributions .",
    "indeed , the uniform dm interaction has already been shown to play a major role for the properties of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 at low temperatures ( below 4.2  k)@xcite and , thus , can be expected to provide the main source of the esr line broadening .",
    "note that the case of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 significantly differs from systems like cu benzoate,@xcite kcugaf@xmath37,@xcite and cuse@xmath0o@xmath55,@xcite where the nonequivalent sites are alternating within the chain and the dm interaction within the chains is staggered as well .",
    "moreover , the influence of staggered fields within the chain on the @xmath24-value has been discussed earlier by nagata@xcite and is expected to increase the anisotropy of the @xmath24 values to low temperatures , which is not observed in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 ( cf .",

    "for their description we shall follow the notations of starykh _",

    "note that the orientation of these axes is essentially different for the two magnetically nonequivalent positions in the unit cell , as described in appendix a. these transformations should be applied for all four chains using the corresponding settings @xmath73 , @xmath74 in chain 1 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 in chain 2 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in chain 3 , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 in chain 4 , following the notation of ref .  .",
