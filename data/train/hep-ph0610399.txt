    "conventionally , the observed colorless hadrons are considered as bound states of quarks and gluons under the _ color confinement _ of the qcd .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair fits in a pattern , where they have quantum numbers of the most of mesons .",
    "the color confinement is achieved by taking into account nonperturbative and nonlinear gluon interaction and the coupling becomes stronger in the hadron distance @xcite .",
    "the correct summation of the higher - order contributions becomes a problem . besides",
    ", the structure of the qcd vacuum is not well established yet .    the conventional qcd encounters a difficulty by defining the explicit quark and gluon propagator at the confinement scale .",
    "particularly , the schwinger - dyson equation is used to obtain an effective quark propagator but this implies additional assumptions on the behaviour of the gluon propagator and quark - gluon vertices and results in elaborated numerical evaluations @xcite .",
    "a number of phenomenological approaches is devoted to the hadron spectroscopy .",
    "some of them are adapted to the specific sector of heavy hadrons and introduce many parameters , including nonphysical ones .",
    "the potential models use a stationary nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with an increasing potential to describe the hadronization process of few - body systems .",
    "however , the binding energy in hadrons is not negligible , e.g. , the observable two - quark bound states have masses much heavier than the predicted combined masses of the current - quarks and it requires a relativistic consideration .",
    "it seems reasonable to develop a simple relativistic quantum field model of interacting quarks and gluons and consider the formation and spectra of the hadrons by using the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "there exists a conception of the _ analytic confinement _ based on the assumption that the qcd vacuum is realized by the vacuum selfdual gluon field which is the classical solution of the yang - mills equation @xcite .",
    "accordingly , each isolated quark and gluon is confined and the corresponding propagators are entire analytic functions in the background gluon field",
    ". however , direct use of these propagators leads to long and complicated estimations .    in our previous investigation",
    ", we have clarified the role of the analytic confinement in formation of the hadron bound states by using simple scalar - field models @xcite .",
    "we have considered `` mesons '' composed from two `` scalar quarks '' glued by `` scalar gluons '' by omitting the spin , color and flavor degrees of freedom . despite the simplicity",
    ", these models resulted in a quite reasonable sight to the underlying physical principles of the hadronization mechanism and could give a qualitative description of the `` scalar '' mesons @xcite .    below we extend the consideration by taking into account the spin , color and flavor degrees of freedom for constituent quarks and gluons within a simple relativistic quantum field model .",
    "this allows us to obtain extended and accurate results not only for the meson ground states but also for the orbital and radial excitations as well as the coupling constant and the glueball lowest state .",
    "consider a yukawa - type interaction of the quarks @xmath2 and gluons @xmath3 confined analytically .",

    "we use a minimal set of physical parameters , namely , the coupling constant , the scale of confinement and the quark masses : @xmath8 .",
    "hereby , we do not distinct the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks and neglect the superheavy @xmath11 quark due to the absence of observed ( @xmath12 ) bound states .",
    "the matrix elements of hadron processes at large distance are in fact integrated characteristics of the quark and gluon propagators and the interaction vertices .",
    "taking into account the correct global symmetry properties and their breaking by introducing additional physical parameters may be more important than the working out in detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we admit that the bound states of quarks and gluons may be found as the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in a variational - integral form @xcite .",
    "one may guess that the solution is not too sensible on the details of integrands .",
    "we consider the effective quark and gluon propagators as follows : @xmath13 \\right\\}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\over m^2 } \\exp\\left\\{-{p^2+m^2\\over 2\\lambda^2 } \\right\\}\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & d^{ab}_{\\mu\\nu}(x)=\\delta^{ab}\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}~{\\lambda^2\\over ( 4\\pi)^2 } ~\\exp\\left\\{-{x^2\\lambda^2\\over 4}\\right\\ } = \\delta^{ab}\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}~d(x )   \\ , , \\label{propagat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 - the quark mass and @xmath16 .",
    "these entire analytic functions in euclidean metric represent more realistic and reasonable extensions to model propagators used in our earlier investigations @xcite and allow us to estimate the meson and glueball spectra with sufficient accuracy by avoiding cumbersome calculations .",

    "describe shortly the important steps of our approach on the example of the two - quark bound states , more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "first , we allocate the one - gluon exchange between quark currents , go to the relative co - ordinates in the `` center - of - mass '' system and introduce the relative mass of quark @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is important for mesons consisting of different quark flavors .",
    "the next step is to perform a fierz transformation to get the colorless bilocal quark currents .",
    "then , introduce an normal basis @xmath23 .",
    "the appropriate diagonalization of @xmath24 on the colorless quark currents should be done by using @xmath23 . use a gaussian path - integral representation by introducing auxiliary meson fields @xmath25 and apply the hadronization ansatz to identify @xmath26 with meson fields carrying the quantum numbers @xmath27 , where @xmath28 - the spin and @xmath29 - the quark flavor .",

    "the final - state interaction between mesons is described by @xmath41=o[b_{\\cal n}^3]$ ] .",
