    "a number of parameters ( e.g. , temperature , pressure / field , molecular weight of polymer ) and processes ( e.g. , rate of polymer release , segmental dynamics , relaxation , etc . ) affect the growth of the polymer density and its interface .",
    "recently we examined the growth of the interface , its scaling , and roughness in an electrophoretic deposition model on a discrete lattice using kink - jump segmental dynamics @xcite and by including reptation @xcite .",
    "we have observed many interesting scaling behaviors of the interface width in these continuous deposition processes where the polymer chains are released at a constant rate throughout the computer simulation .    as the polymer chains deposit , the polymer density spreads from the substrate toward the source of the polymer chains , and the interface width grows .",

    "the study of relaxations at polymer surfaces is relatively new @xcite , and characteristic surface relaxation times @xmath10 have been measured for some polymer materials @xcite .",
    "one approach to achieve such a relaxation in simulations is to stop injecting new polymer chains after an appropriate amount of polymer chains are in the system but continue to allow segmental motion of the chains .",
