    "suppose that single - point velocity fluctuations @xmath0 are measured repeatedly in stationary turbulence over the range @xmath1 .",
    "if the sampling interval is much greater than the eddy turnover timescale , these measurements serve as independent realizations of the turbulence .",
    "each of them is expanded into a fourier series as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wave number .",
    "batchelor @xcite assumed that the fourier coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 are statistically independent of each other and applied the central limit theorem to their sum .",
    "this theorem ensures that the probability density function ( pdf ) of a sum of many independent random variables tends to gaussian , at least within a few standard deviations around the average @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that velocity fluctuations tend to gaussian , being consistent with experimental and observational data of turbulence that were available at that time .",
    "however , recent measurements revealed the presence of velocity fluctuations that tend to non - gaussian .",
    "sreenivasan and dhruva @xcite obtained long data of atmospheric turbulence at 35 m above the ground .",
    "their data yield the flatness factor @xmath6 , where the bracket @xmath7 denotes an average .",
    "this value is different from the gaussian value @xmath8 .",
    "noullez et al .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath9 in turbulent jets .",
    "for these results , there has been no explanation .",
    "therefore , although single - point velocity fluctuations are fundamental in describing turbulence , the mechanism that determines their pdf is uncertain .",
    "we systematically study velocity fluctuations in a laboratory rough - wall boundary layer , a representative turbulent flow with various applications , e.g. , the atmosphere near the ground . with an increase of the distance from the wall ,",
    "velocity fluctuations are found to change from sub - gaussian ( @xmath10 ) to gaussian , and to hyper - gaussian ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this behavior is discussed using pdfs of the fourier coefficients and correlations among them .",
    "this section serves as a summary of conditions for velocity fluctuations to be approximately gaussian .",
    "it is assumed that the turbulence is not only stationary but also homogeneous in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the data length is set to be much larger than the correlation length @xmath13 .",
    "then an average taken over the realizations is equal to the corresponding average taken over the @xmath12 positions .",
    "velocity fluctuations of turbulence are dominated by fourier coefficients in the energy - containing range .",
    "since the data length is large , there is a sufficient number of fourier coefficients for the central limit theorem to be applicable .",
    "velocity fluctuations tend to gaussian if the fourier coefficients are random and independent .",
    "this is expected for ideal turbulence where energy - containing motions are random and independent .",
    "although turbulence always contains small - scale coherent structures , e.g. , vortex tubes @xcite , their contribution to velocity fluctuations is as small as the energy ratio of the dissipation range to the energy - containing range .",
    "the central limit theorem is not applicable to a sum of variables if few of them dominate over the others @xcite .",
    "for example , if the energy spectrum @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 with @xmath16 , fourier coefficients at the smallest wave numbers dominate the velocity fluctuations .",
    "they do not necessarily tend to gaussian @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the energy spectrum is relatively flat in the usual energy - containing range , where the power law @xmath15 is not a good approximation .",
    "we previously assumed that the central limit theorem is not applicable to the sum of fourier coefficients in any turbulence @xcite , but this assumption was wrong .",
    "fourier coefficients of velocity fluctuations also tend to gaussian if turbulence is made of random and independent motions @xcite .",
    "the fourier coefficient @xmath4 is obtained as @xmath17 for @xmath18 , we are able to set @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the integrations @xmath21 , ... , and @xmath22 are regarded as random variables .",
    "their amplitudes are the same because the segment size @xmath23 exceeds the wavelength @xmath24 .",
    "they are nearly independent because adjacent integrations depend on each other only at the ends .",
    "then @xmath4 tends to gaussian as a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "this discussion is not applicable to fourier coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath25 .",
    "they are nevertheless small and do not contribute to velocity fluctuations if the data length @xmath26 is sufficiently large , because of the universal trend @xmath27 in the limit @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we are able to assume safely that all the fourier coefficients are gaussian .",
    "the central limit theorem offers no information about the tails of the pdf of a sum of variables .",
    "only when the sum ( minus its mean ) has been divided by the square root of the number of the variables , the gaussian approximation holds at the tails @xcite . although statistics such as the flatness factor mainly reflect the core of the pdf , the tails that are significantly far from gaussian could exist and affect the statistics .",
    "one example is significant contamination with a bounded - amplitude motion , e.g. , @xmath29 , the pdf of which does not have tails .",
    "velocity fluctuations tend to sub - gaussian , e.g. , @xmath30 for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the fourier coefficients that correspond to the bounded - amplitude motion also tend to sub - gaussian @xcite .",
    "another example is significant intermittency , where velocity fluctuations tend to hyper - gaussian @xcite .",
    "the fourier coefficients also tend to hyper - gaussian because some of the integrations @xmath21 , ... , and @xmath22 are enhanced over the others . since the fourier coefficients are linear functions of velocity fluctuations , sub- and hyper - gaussianities of the velocity fluctuations yield sub- and hyper - gaussianities of the fourier coefficients , respectively , and vice versa .",
    "we expect that this relation could approximately exist even in the case of mutually dependent fourier coefficients as long as the dependence is weak .",
    "the experiment was done in a wind tunnel of the meteorological research institute . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", we use the coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 in the streamwise , spanwise , and floor - normal directions .",
    "the corresponding wind velocities are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we take the origin @xmath36 on the tunnel floor at the entrance to the test section .",
    "the test section had the size @xmath37 m , @xmath38 m , and @xmath39 m. a boundary layer was made by placing blocks over the entire floor of the test section .",
    "the blocks had the size @xmath40 cm , @xmath41 cm , and @xmath42 cm .",
    "the spacings of the adjacent blocks were @xmath43 cm and @xmath44 cm .",
    "we set the in - coming wind velocity to be 20 m  s@xmath45 .",
    "the boundary layer was well developed at @xmath46 m.    the @xmath33 and @xmath34 or @xmath33 and @xmath35 components of the wind velocity were measured using a hot - wire anemometer with an x - type probe .",
    "the wires were made of tungsten , 5 @xmath47 m in diameter , 1.0 mm in effective length , 1.4 mm in separation , oriented at @xmath48 to the streamwise direction , and operated at the temperature of @xmath49c .",
    "the measurement positions were at @xmath50 m and @xmath511.00 m. the signal was low - pass filtered with 24 db / octave and sampled digitally with 16-bit resolution . at @xmath52 m ,",
    "the filtering frequency was 10 khz and the sampling frequency was 20 khz . at @xmath53 m , they were 25 khz and 50 khz , respectively .",
    "the length of the signal was @xmath54 points at @xmath55 , 0.14 , 0.24 , 0.28 , 0.40 , 0.50 , 0.60 , 0.80 , and 1.00 m or @xmath56 points at @xmath51 , 0.08 , 0.17 , 0.20 , 0.32 , 0.36 , 0.70 , and 0.90 m. we used the frozen - eddy hypothesis of taylor to convert temporal variations into spatial variations .",

    "the 99% thickness , i.e. , the height at which @xmath57 is 99% of its maximum value @xmath62 , is 0.68 m. the displacement thickness @xmath63 is 0.17 m @xcite . for reference ,",
    "the average @xmath57 and the root - mean - square fluctuation @xmath59 obtained in the in - coming flow at @xmath64 m are shown .",

    "the logarithmic law that corresponds to the constant stress is unclear in the profile of the mean streamwise velocity [ fig .",

    "the flatness factors are close to 3 at @xmath72 m. as the height is increased above @xmath73 m , the flatness factors begin to increase .",
    "they have pronounced peaks at @xmath74 m. the skewness factors are also significant at @xmath75 m , except for the @xmath34 component that is free from the shear of the boundary layer .",
    "similar results were obtained in previous works @xcite .",
    "we focus on the @xmath34 component , which is best suited to our analysis .",
    "the range of flatness factor is widest .",

    "figure  [ f4](a ) shows the energy spectrum @xmath78 for the @xmath34 component at @xmath51 , 0.36 , and 0.70 m. figure  [ f4](b ) shows the flatness factor of the fourier coefficient @xmath79 .",
    "figure  [ f4](c ) shows the mode - mode correlation @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 corresponds to the wave number @xmath84 of the @xmath78 peak .",
    "these quantities were obtained by dividing the data into segments of @xmath85 points .",
    "we regarded them as independent realizations of turbulence , applied the fourier transformation individually to them , and calculated averages over them at each of the wave numbers .",
    "the energy spectrum was obtained using the welch window function . since this and other usual window functions",
    "were found to affect significantly the flatness factor or mode - mode correlation , we were forced to obtain them by appending the inverted sequence to each sequence of the segments .",
    "any method to remove effects of discontinuity at the ends of a data segment modifies the data and thereby affects some of the statistics .",

    "the flatness factor of the fourier coefficient is close to gaussian [ fig .",

    "even if the fourier coefficient at the @xmath78 peak has a large amplitude , its effect to velocity fluctuations tends to be weakened by small amplitudes of the fourier coefficients at nearby wave numbers , as compared with a noncorrelation case .    the mode - mode correlation shown in fig .",

    "they are accordingly hyper - gaussian .",
    "the intermittency is also responsible for the hyper - gaussianity of the fourier coefficients ( sec .",
    "the presence of spatial structures is responsible for the presence of mode - mode correlation .",
    "it should be noted that , since turbulence is not space filling , this intermittency is regarded as contamination of turbulence with a laminar flow .",
    "the hyper - gaussianity of velocity fluctuations in the outer sublayer has been known to be an intermittent phenomenon for a long time , readily understood in the space domain @xcite .",
    "their fourier coefficients in the wave number domain are not so useful but have interesting properties as in the cases of sub - gaussian and gaussian velocity fluctuations .    figure  [ f5 ] summarizes behaviors of the fourier coefficients as a function of the height @xmath32 : ( a ) the wave number @xmath84 of the peak of the energy spectrum , ( b ) the flatness factor of the fourier coefficient @xmath91 , and ( c ) the mode - mode correlation @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
