    "it is well - recognized and generally accepted in nuclear theory that two ingredients are essential in nuclear dynamics , a large attraction and a large repulsion balancing each other providing the small nuclear binding energy observed in nature . in an effective field theory description ,",
    "the former is simulated by the exchange of an iso - scalar scalar meson ( denoted by @xmath3 ) of mass @xmath4 mev and the latter by that of an iso - scalar vector meson of mass @xmath5 mev ( identified with @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is also accepted that when considered at the large @xmath7 limit in qcd , baryons can be described as skyrmions  @xcite and hence nuclear matter could be described as a skyrmion matter  @xcite .    in this short note",
    "we first point out that there is a serious problem in describing dense matter in terms of skyrmions due to a hitherto unobserved interplay between the scalar and vector degrees of freedom and then show that the problem can be resolved by resorting to an intricate interplay between scale - chiral symmetry and hidden local symmetry ( hls for short ) .",
    "it was discovered in @xcite that when skyrmions are put on lattice to simulate dense baryonic matter with a hidden gauge symmetric lagrangian implemented with scale symmetry to take into account the change of vacuum in medium  @xcite , the energy of the system , the medium - modified pion decay constant @xmath8 and masses of the vector mesons and the pion diverge because of the divergence of the medium - modified expectation value of dilaton @xmath9 .",
    "this observation is in stark contrast to the intuitive expectation that , at very high density , chiral symmetry should be restored and hadronic phase should transit to quark(-gluon ) phase .",
    "moreover , in the hls approach , it was found that at very high density or temperature the vector manifestation ( vm for short ) fixed point should be approached with @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the dilaton compensated chiral effective theory of baryonic matter , it was expected that at high density , the theory should go toward a dilaton - limit ( dl ) fixed point characterized by @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "what s observed in @xcite is therefore consistent with neither the intuitive expectation nor effective theory calculations .",
    "the lagrangian involved in @xcite consisted of the standard ( normal - parity ) hls lagrangian with an expicit chiral symmetry breaking mass term , @xmath12 in chiral counting ( with @xmath13 ignored ) , plus the anomalous , homogeneous wess - zumino ( hwz ) term , @xmath13 in chiral counting .",
    "the @xmath6 meson , crucial in nuclear dynamics , enters by coupling to other degrees of freedom via the hwz term , so the latter is essential for taking into account the @xmath6 meson in the dynamics even though it is at the next - to - leading order in the chiral counting , that is of @xmath13 . as has been well established , the skyrmion model with hls lagrangian with @xmath14 and @xmath15  and without @xmath6  fares well in finite nuclei as well as in nuclear matter , so the culprit in the trouble encountered in @xcite was the @xmath6 associated with the hwz term .",
    "indeed the presence of the lowest iso - vector vector mesons @xmath15 and iso - vector axial - vector mesons @xmath16 improves the structure of finite nuclei over the skyrme model ( with pion only ) , with further improvement moving toward a bps structure by an infinite tower  @xcite .",
    "the problem arises , however , when the hwz term is taken into account  @xcite .    by itself ,",
    "the hwz term is classically scale - invariant , so the dilaton field @xmath17 does not figure in that term .",
    "therefore , the condensate @xmath18 which controls the in - medium behavior of the lagrangian  @xcite does not enter in the hwz term in medium .",
    "the hwz contribution to the energy of the skyrmion matter is found to diverge when integrated over the space unless the strong @xmath6 coupling to other degrees of freedom is suppressed . as a way - out , in @xcite , a factor @xmath19",
    "was multiplied to the hwz term , _ explicitly _ breaking the scale invariance , and @xmath20 was varied so as to tame the divergence . it was found that with @xmath21 or 3 , the problem was removed .",
    "however in @xcite , this procedure was totally arbitrary , with justification from neither theory nor experiment . in this note",
    "we derive this result by generalizing the notion of scale - chiral effective theory proposed by crewther and tunstall  @xcite ( ct for short ) to hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we start with the hls lagrangian proposed in @xcite implemented with scale symmetry that was used in @xcite .",
    "it is in the form _ hls & = & f_^2()^2tr[__^ ] + a f_^2()^2 tr[__^ ] + & - & [ v_v^ ] + l_hwz + & + & 12 _ ^+ v ( ) , [ prv1 ] where the relevant degrees of freedom that figure are  in addition to the pion field @xmath22  the @xmath23 vector fields @xmath24 and the conformal compensator field @xmath25 with @xmath3 being the dilaton field . in lagrangian ( [ prv1 ] )",
    ", @xmath26 is the homogeneous wess - zumino term that consists of three independent terms that are reduced to one term in @xcite as specified below and @xmath27 is the dilaton potential term that accounts for the trace anomaly of qcd . for simplicity , without the loss of generality in our discussion , we can take the chiral limit .",
    "several comments are in order before proceeding further .",
    "apart from the dilaton potential @xmath27 , the lagrangian ( [ prv1 ] ) is scale invariant .",
    "it is of @xmath12 in the chiral - scale counting except for @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "we will explain later why @xmath13 terms in the hls sector will not affect our argument .",
    "the hwz term is scale - dimension-4 , hence scale invariant .",
    "but it is of @xmath13 in the chiral - scale counting .",
    "it is this term that does the havoc to the dense skyrmion matter but can not be ignored because it is the only way the @xmath6 meson enters in nuclear dynamics .    in order to resolve the disaster encountered in @xcite , we resort to the strategy proposed by crewther and tunstall  @xcite in implementing scale symmetry to chiral lagrangian . how this strategy resolves",
    "a variety of scalar - meson conundrum in nuclear physics was discussed in @xcite .",

    "because of the slope of the beta function , or equivalently the anomalous dimension of the gluon @xmath1 , @xmath0 , although the hwz terms @xmath34 is scale - invariant at the classical level , the dilaton couples to them due to the quantum anomaly .",
    "as mentioned before , we ignore the @xmath13 terms in the hls sector .    in the lagrangian  , the low - energy constants @xmath35 can not all be fixed unambiguously . here , however , modulo explicit scale symmetry breaking which brings in additional @xmath12 chiral - scale order  la crewther and tunstall  @xcite , we can take @xmath36 .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , this is justified as we are working with @xmath12 normal - parity component of hls . with this choice",

    "[ leading ]    as stated , we reduce the hwz term to a single term which can be obtained by a suitable choice of the coefficients of the three terms , _ hwz = g_b^(c_h+(1-c_h)()^^ ) [ hwz ] where @xmath37 is the topological ( baryon ) current . the constant @xmath38 is an unknown constant together with the anomalous dimension @xmath33 .",
    "one can actually treat all three hwz terms as was done in @xcite . for our purpose",
    "this is unnecessary .",
    "we have assured ourselves that the qualitative feature we are treating is not affected .",

    "if @xmath33 were @xmath42 , at the leading order of @xmath33 , the dilaton potential would go to the log - type potential widely used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "but here we will keep it as a parameter since it should be of @xmath43 to realize the vm and the dilaton - limit as we will see later .",
    "the solution to the problem encountered in @xcite turns out to be amazingly simple .",
    "the solution given in @xcite corresponds to ( [ hwz ] ) with 2 ^ 3 ,   c_h0[prv2 ] with no other modifications .",
    "there the same lagrangian as ( [ leading ] ) and the potential ( [ potential ] ) were used but the factor @xmath19 with @xmath44 was multiplied without any justification to @xmath45 to simply quench the gauge coupling @xmath46 for increasing density . here ,",
    "as explained in the last section , the qcd trace anomaly is seen to do the job .",
    "it is extremely interesting to explore what information one can get on the role of explicit scale symmetry breaking characterized by @xmath47 from dense baryonic matter .",
    "there is no information that can be trusted on @xmath33 in qcd with @xmath48 and @xmath49 from experiments or theory .",
    "we are aware of calculation of @xmath33 in scheme - independent series expansion for @xmath50 but it does not give any hint on qcd proper with three flavors .",
    "therefore it is intriguing that dense nuclear matter may be able to say something , tentative though it may be , about the anomalous dimension of the gluon field strength tensor squared .",
    "for this purpose , we proceed to look at the model defined above and simulate dense skyrmion matter with two parameters @xmath33 and @xmath38",
    ". to gain a rough idea , we take the parameters used in @xcite , @xmath51mev and @xmath52  mev . other values in the vicinity of these would not affect the results qualitatively .    to confront nature ,",
    "i.e. , the eos for compact stars , the @xmath23 symmetry for the vector mesons @xmath53 that holds well in the matter - free vacuum can not remain unbroken at density @xmath54  @xcite . with breaking of @xmath23 symmetry for the vector mesons , the half - skyrmion phase which controls the symmetry energy in compact - star matter sets in at @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this structure is not present with the @xmath23 symmetry for the @xmath56 and the low - mass dilaton , @xmath51mev .",
    "both of these features are not realistic since the @xmath23 symmetry should be strongly broken in dense matter  @xcite and the dilaton mass could be higher in the matter - free vacuum .",
    "however the qualitative feature we are concerned with is the divergence of the decay constant @xmath57 and the consequent violent deviation from the concordant vm / dl fixed point , and this behavior is indifferent to the presence of the half - skyrmion phase .    in the model",

    "it seems safe to say that @xmath65 is ruled out from what s found in dense matter .",
    "these ranges could be sharpened if the unrealistic features mentioned above were suitably accounted for .",

    "this figure shows that the hadron properties are not significantly changed by @xmath38 as long as it is @xmath66 .",

    "several intriguing predictions follow from the above observation .",
    "the first is that in dense matter , the @xmath6 coupling to other degrees of freedom is suppressed by the explicit breaking of scale symmetry .",
    "this would also ameliorate a similar disturbing situation in holographic models .",
    "for instance in the sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite , at the leading order @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the thooft constant , the 5d ym lagrangian in flat space describes baryonic matter as a bps - instanton matter .",
    "it has zero binding energy , which is close to nature where the binding energy of heavy nuclei is tiny .",
    "however this picture breaks down at the next order in @xmath72 , i.e. , at @xmath73 . at that order , the chern - simons term with @xmath74 vector field  which corresponds to the @xmath6 meson in 4d  enters and spoils drastically the nice agreement obtained at the leading order  @xcite .",
    "this can also be seen in the bottom - up approach of sutcliffe  @xcite where it is found that the  good result \" obtained by adding more and more iso - vector and axial - vector mesons in the skyrmion structure gets spoiled when the @xmath6 fields are taken into account .",
    "the result we obtained here suggests that this problem can also be resolved by the @xmath33 effect when the broken scale symmetry is suitably implemented into the chern - simons term .",
    "a potentially more significant implication of this result is that dense baryonic matter can provide information on the fundamental quantity , the anomalous dimension @xmath33 , and the constant @xmath38 .",
    "there is a recent work which purports to access this quantity in gauge theories , but for @xmath75  @xcite  indicates that the upper limit is likely more relevant . ] .",
    "so this quantity  as well as @xmath38  is essentially unknown .",
    "what one gets in dense matter is therefore quite suggestive and deserves further studies .",
    "there is an intriguing hint that hls limited to @xmath12 gives highly non - trivial predictions that are unavailable from other approaches  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the ksrf relation , which works surprisingly well , is found to hold to _ all _ loop orders  @xcite .",
    "there is also the vector dominance phenomenon which is otherwise hard to derive .",
    "all this put together would suggest that in scale - invariant hls applied to dense matter , one may ignore @xmath13 terms except for the hwz terms  which are essential . a numerical evidence for this is given in @xcite . in medium , the same suppression as is observed in the hwz terms could be effective for _ all _ @xmath13 terms , in which case the leading order lagrangians given above should be reliable , making the theory much simpler than thought .",
