    "there are many challenges to simulate the phenomena on black holes by using condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "one of them is to study an analogy between gravity and superfluidity , in which a superfluid ground state ( superfluid vacuum ) serves as the analog of the vacuum of relativistic quantum fields , while the flow of the superfluid liquid imitates the metric field acting on ` relativistic ' quasiparticles ( phonons , ripplons , fermionic excitations , etc . ) @xcite .",
    "the radiation from the black holes can be tested in this analogy , for example the hawking radiation @xcite . in this work",
    "we discuss how using atomic bose - einstein condensates one can simulate the zeldovich - starobinskii ( zs ) effect @xcite  the amplification and spontaneous emission of electromagnetic waves by a body rotating in the quantum vacuum , or by a rotating black hole ( kerr - bh ) .",
    "radiation of electromagnetic mode occurs if its frequency @xmath1 and its angular momentum quantum number @xmath2 satisfy the condition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angular velocity of the rotating body .",
    "this corresponds to the negative energy of the mode in the frame co - rotating with the body . in the kerr black hole",
    "the negative energy states exist in the ergoregion , where the speed of the frame dragging exceeds that of light . in the ergoregion @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the ergoregion @xmath6 , where the speed of frame dragging is equal to the speed of light , is called the ergosurface ,",
    "phonon excitation in a superfluid moving with velocity @xmath7 has the doppler shifted energy @xmath8 . from this dispersion relation",
    "it follows that phonon trajectory in moving liquid obeys the null - geodesic equation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the interval determined by the acoustic metric introduced by unruh@xcite @xmath11 in superfluids the speed of light and the frame dragging velocity are played by sound velocity @xmath12 and superfluid velocity @xmath7 correspondingly .",
    "then in the ergoregion the superfluid velocity satisfies the condition @xmath13 , while the ergosurface , on which @xmath6 for the acoustic metric , is defined as a surface with @xmath14 .",
    "now let us consider an small object moving in a stationary superfluid along the circular trajectory with radius @xmath15 and with linear velocity @xmath16 . since in bec the landau critical velocity for creation of quasiparticles is @xmath17 , naive consideration suggests that the object is not radiating .",
    "however , radiation occurs due to zeldovich - starobinskii effect . to see that let us choose the reference frame rotating with the angular velocity @xmath18 . in this frame",
    "the object is stationary , while the superfluid moves with velocity field @xmath19 , where we use the cylindrical coordinate @xmath20 . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the superfluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound and @xmath5 , which demonstrates that @xmath22 marks the position of the ergorsurface . in the ergoregion ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath21 , the energy of some phonons becomes negative .",
    "these are phonons that satisfy condition @xmath3 : @xmath23 it is energetically favorable to create these phonon modes in the ergoregion . however , the source of the radiation  the moving body  is away from the ergoregion : @xmath24 . in the process of radiation",
    "the phonon mode created by the source at @xmath25 is tunneling through the barrier of the positive energy region @xmath26 to the ergoregion at @xmath27 @xcite . in the infinite system",
    "the radiation takes place for arbitrary @xmath4 , and thus for arbitrary velocity of the circulating object , though for small @xmath28 the ergoregion is far from the object and the probability of quantum tunneling is suppressed by factor @xmath29 .",
    "now let us consider how the zs effect is modified in a finite system  in an atomic bec trapped by an axisymmetrical potential at @xmath0 .",
    "the condensate is initially at rest in the laboratory frame .",
    "the moving heavy body is reproduced by the additional potential which makes a small dip in the condensate at @xmath15 ( see fig.[fig : frictionless_state ] _ left _ ) and this dip is circulating with linear velocity @xmath16 .",
    "as in case of the moving body the circulating dip serves as an environment which provides us with the preferred reference frame .",
    "this is the frame rotating with frequency @xmath30 in which the trapping potential and the dip are time - independent .",
    "the main difference from the infinite system discussed above is that in the finite system the negative energy states in the rotating frame appear only after @xmath4 reaches some critical value @xmath31 . as a result",
    "the radiation occurs only after the velocity of the object reaches @xmath32 .",
    "thus in the finite system the critical velocity of the circulating object is non - zero , but it is much smaller than the landau critical velocity @xmath12 if the object is close to the center of the condensate .",
    "the states with @xmath33 are frictionless : they correspond to the local minima of the energy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the angular momentum of the superfluid ( fig.[fig : phase_space]-(a ) ) . in these states ,",
    "all the quasiparticles have positive energy in the rotating frame ; @xmath36 . at @xmath37",
    "the stability is lost , the local minimum transforms to the saddle point ( fig.[fig : phase_space]-(b ) ) , and the moving object would radiate quasiparticles with negative energy @xmath38 .",
    "let us illustrate this using numerical simulations of the bec . in the absence of quasiparticles , bec at @xmath39 can be described by the macroscopic wave function @xmath40 $ ] , which satisfies the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath41 here @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the atomic mass and @xmath46-wave scattering length , @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer to the trapping and the object potential , respectively .",
    "we shall consider the two - dimensional system with a harmonic potential @xmath49 , and the object potential @xmath48 is assumed to be localized and repulsive .",
    "the frictionless states below @xmath31 are obtained using the imaginary time propagation ( itp ) of the gross - pitaevskii energy .",
    "the states above @xmath31 are also obtained with the itp if the time of development of instability is long enough . in fig.[fig : frictionless_state ] the state is shown with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the particle number per unit length along the @xmath53 axis and @xmath54 .",
    "the object potential has a gaussian form @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the thomas - fermi radius of the condensate .",
    "since the object potential is weak , the circulating object makes a small density dip at @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : frictionless_state]-(a ) ) , which practically does not disturb the superfluid velocity @xmath61 : it is almost zero everywhere in the laboratory frame ( fig.[fig : frictionless_state]-(b ) ) .",
    "the role of the dip is to provide the perturbation which violates the cylindrical symmetry and induces the nonzero matrix element for the transition between the state without quasiparticles and the states with quasiparticles ; the dip also provides the distinguished reference frame which in the absence of other interactions serves as the frame of the environment .",
    "let us now find the critical velocity @xmath31 , at which the negative energy phonon mode appears in the condensate and thus the radiation becomes energetically possible .",
    "the spectrum of quasiparticles are obtained by coupling the gp eq.([eq : gp ] ) and the bogoliubov de gennes ( bdg ) equation . for the calculation of the spectrum we may neglect the small deformation of the condensate caused by the object potential and consider the axisymmetric bec @xmath62 .",
    "then the bose operator is written as @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the numbers @xmath66 and @xmath2 refer to the radial and angular quantum number of quasiparticles and the sum @xmath67 is taken without a trivial zero - energy mode @xmath68 . as a result the bdg eq .",
    "is reduced to @xcite @xmath69 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{ccc } t_+ & -u \\\\ u^ * & -t_- \\\\ \\end{array }   \\right ] \\left [   \\begin{array}{ccc } u_{kl}(\\rho )",
    "\\\\ v_{kl}(\\rho ) \\\\ \\end{array }",
    "\\right ] , \\label{eq : bdgcyl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70+v_{\\rm trap}+2g|\\phi|^2-\\mu \\mp \\hbar l \\omega$ ] and @xmath71 .",
    "the normalized condition of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "it can be shown that the values @xmath72 and @xmath73 are independent of @xmath4 but the energy spectrum depends as @xmath75 .    the mode @xmath76 can be radiated if the rotation velocity @xmath4 reaches the value @xmath77 , which satisfies condition @xmath78 .",
    "this value @xmath77 is plotted in fig.[fig : bdg_graph]-(a ) for @xmath79 .",
    "modes with @xmath80 are most important , since modes with higher @xmath66 have higher @xmath77 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg_graph]-(a ) it follows that the mode @xmath81 has the lowest value of the critical velocity ; it thus determines the global critical velocity at which radiation becomes possible : @xmath82 .",
    "since quantum numbers of relevant modes are small , the classical notion of the ergoregion is not well defined . nevertheless , ergosurface may be crudely introduced as the surface @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the local speed of sound ( fig.[fig : bdg_graph]-(b ) ) .",
    "the position of the ergosurface for @xmath85 is @xmath86 , i.e. at the periphery of the condensate and far from the circulating object .",
    "this confirms the general picture that an object circulating with the subsonic velocity spontaneously radiates sound modes which are formed far from the object .",
    "this is also supported by exact quantum mechanical consideration .",
    "if the circulating object is small the matrix element of transition is concentrated locally at the position of the object @xmath60 , and the radiation rate of the mode @xmath76 is proportional to the condensate density @xmath87 at the position of the object and to the probability density @xmath88 of the mode also at the position of the object , and thus it is determined by the product @xmath89 .    the probability density of the @xmath80 mode @xmath90 is shown in fig.[fig : bdg_graph]-(c ) .",
    "the ` penetration ' of the mode into the central region of the condensate is monotonically decreasing as @xmath91 is reduced . in terms of the semiclassical description , this reduction can be interpreted as the tunneling of quasiparticles into the energetically forbidden region @xcite . the quantity @xmath89 which determines the radiation rate is shown in fig.[fig : bdg_graph]-(d ) .",
    "it demonstrates that the radiation is enhanced as the object becomes closer to the ergosurface .",
    "spontaneous radiation is possible by an external object circulating in bec with linear velocity much smaller than the landau critical velocity .",
    "the origin of radiation is similar to the zs radiation from the kerr black hole .",
    "it can be described in terms of quantum tunneling through the energetically forbidden region between the object and the ergoregion .",
    "the radiation rate depends on rotation speed and on the distance between the object and the ergosurface .",
    "the role of the object might be played by the moving optical potential made by the blue or red detuned laser .",
