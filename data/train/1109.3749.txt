    "the delta functions remove the sums over @xmath124 .",
    "all that is left , then , is to find the residues @xmath125 . to achieve this ,",

    "@xcite , and can be calculated in terms of continued fractions by the same means . within ma@xmath39 ,",
    "they are equal to : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the usual single - particle polaron green s function , and we define @xmath129 where the continuous fractions are @xcite : @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the momentum average of the bare propagator .    on the other hand , from its lehmann representation : @xmath132 so its residue for @xmath133 , the gs energy , is the product @xmath134 .",
    "the first term is related to the gs quasiparticle weight @xmath135 , and the second is the overlap that we need .",
    "it follows that : @xmath136 the @xmath77-independent part can be shown to be related to the probability to have @xmath24-particles at the electron site in the gs . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these probabilities were found to be : @xmath137 the @xmath77-dependent terms can be grouped together with the one from @xmath53 into the corresponding function @xmath78 , whose expression is given in eq .",
    "( [ fn ] ) .",
    "the essence of this approximation is to replace the two - particle green s functions appearing in @xmath138 , namely @xmath139 , by a convolution of the single - particle spectral weights .",
    "the procedure is reviewed in detail in ref .",
    ". the regular part of the conductivity , at finite @xmath101 and on a cubic lattice , is then found to be [ their eq .",
    "( 19 ) ] : @xmath140.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath141 is the polaron spectral weight and @xmath142 is the dirac function .",
    "this is the same formula used in dmft , see for example eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .",
    "the difference is that in dmft , the integral over the brillouin zone is replaced by an integral over energies @xmath143 ( they also replace @xmath144 ) .",
    "this explains the appearance of the density of states @xmath145 of the free lattice , and of the dmft vertex @xmath146 which is the equivalent of the @xmath147 in the above equation .",
    "of course , within dmft one uses the dmft self - energy in the spectral weight .    in order to limit the quantitative differences of the dos used in dmft , which is for a bethe lattice , whereas our other results are for a cubic lattice , we use eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) for a cubic lattice to test this approximation . also ,",
    "for convenience , we use the ma self - energy in the spectral weight .",
    "this is simpler because in order to calculate the dmft self - energy , one needs to go through iterations to reach self - consistency . in any event ,",
    "the ma and dmft self - energies are qualitatively and even quantitatively in fairly good agreement , as shown in the appendix of ref .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the ma spectral weights are very accurate , satisfying eight sum rules exactly ( within ma@xmath63 ) , therefore using the ma self - energy and its corresponding spectral weight can lead , at most , to modest quantitative differences .",
    "since the ma@xmath63 self - energy is momentum - independent ( momentum dependence appears only from the ma@xmath148 level ) , we can carry the integral over the brillouin zone as follows .",
    "we rewrite the spectral weights as      as a result , the integral over the brillouin zone now becomes a simple momentum average of the bare propagator ( with shifted frequency ) times the @xmath151 term .",
    "one integral can be done analytically , and the other two numerically like other similar momentum averages calculated for ma@xmath148 , see ref .",
    "one is then left with evaluating the integral over @xmath152 numerically as well .",
    "one can approach the @xmath12 limit either directly by replacing the fermi - dirac distribution with a heaviside function , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite ; or by calculating the @xmath153 limit of the ratio detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite . either approach has its own numerical challenges , and overall we find both procedures to be more time consuming than evaluating our oc formula , even when the computationally trivial ma self - energy is used in the spectral weight .",
    "note , also , that our oc formula is formulated directly for @xmath12 and therefore one needs not worry about how to properly approach this limit .    the @xmath154 spectral weight for the polaron , at intermediary coupling @xmath99 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ supp1 ] .",
    "the gs peak still has considerable weight @xmath155 , and just above it we see the peak corresponding to the second bound state , followed by the continuum and higher energy features .",
    "the rough expectation is that a convolution of this curve with itself will show a first peak when the two curves are shifted by @xmath156 , the energy difference between the two bound states ; also , absorption into the continuum will appear for frequencies @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the naive expectation based on the convolution is that as soon as the second bound state is formed , there should be absorption into it , at energies below the threshold @xmath7 .",
    "this is also what is shown by the full dmft calculations at very low temperatures , see curve of fig . 2 and its interpretation from fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , in qualitative agreement with our own calculation for @xmath163 , shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) of the main article .    in reality",
    ", very careful analysis suggests that the weight of this peak decreases monotonically with @xmath101 , and therefore at @xmath12 it is very likely that this approach also predicts no absorption below the threshold at @xmath7 , in agreement with the dmc and ma approaches .",
    "our understanding of the disappearance of this peak is that it comes from the fact that the @xmath164 convolution is multiplied by @xmath147 , so strictly speaking there is no contribution to the oc from the gs momentum , unless some `` thermal broadening '' is allowed at non - zero temperatures .",
    "since the exact dmc calculation finds no such absorption into the second bound state at any @xmath84 , the matrix element for this transition must be zero , likely because of the different symmetry of the phonon clouds in the two states , as discussed in detail for 1d systems in ref .",
    "clearly , our ma - based oc formula captures this selection rule properly  note that the generalized single - particle green s functions that appear in it are different from the green s function that gives the spectral weight .    on the other hand",
    ", there is nothing in the spectral weight that encodes the symmetry of the wavefunction associated with a bound state , for example one can not distinguish the parity of a state by looking at the plot of the spectral weight .",
    "thus , it seems to us that generically , one should expect the convolution approximation to fail to properly account for selection rules .",
    "in fact , this statement can be tested in 1d , where as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one may expect higher energy bound states , some of which are optically active . in other models ,",
    "it has been suggested that there may even be bound - states below the continuum which are not visible in the spectral weight , because their quasiparticle weight vanishes for symmetry reasons @xcite  if such states are optically active , absorption associated with them would certainly not be predicted by the convolution approximation .",
    "such a study will be undertaken elsewhere , and should clarify whether the agreement in 3d regarding the lack of sub - threshold absorption in the no - current vertex approximation is accidental , or it actually has a more robust explanation . in any event , this is probably somewhat of an academic discussion , since such multiple bound states appear only at large effective couplings @xmath84 where the bulk of the optical absorption is at very much higher energies , and in measurements the very small signal at the threshold may be buried in noise .",
    "be that as it may , to us it appears that besides being numerically more difficult to evaluate and less tested in terms of its accuracy for sum rules etc , the no - current vertex approximation also fails to provide the insight into the overall evolution of the oc curves that is afforded by our new formula .",
    "moreover , ma has already been demonstrated to generalize very successfully to models where the coupling depends on the phonon and electron momentum , and we expect similar success in modeling their oc .",
    "such models have strongly momentum - dependent self - energies , and are unlikely to be described accurately with a local - approximation like dmft ."
