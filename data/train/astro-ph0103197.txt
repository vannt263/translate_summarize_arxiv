    "millimeter - wave ( co ) observations of qsos have not been a traditional means of studying the underlying qso host galaxies .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that millimeter - wave telescopes and arrays with large ( @xmath9500 m@xmath10 ) collecting areas and sensitive , low - noise receivers have only been available within approximately the last decade ; prior to this time , single - dish and interferometric co(@xmath2 ) observations of `` distant '' sources with faint mid- and far - ir flux densities , such as the @xmath11 qso mrk 1014 (= pg 0157 + 001 : sanders et al .",
    "1988a ) , were time - consuming ventures . as a result , it is not surprising that most of the advances in our understanding of qsos have been achieved via observations obtained at other wavelengths ( primarily optical and radio ) .",
    "the situation today is significantly different from what it was circa 1990 ",
    "millimeter arrays operated by caltech , the berkeley - illinois - maryland ( bima ) consortium , nobeyama , and iram have five to six 1015 m diameter dishes with state - of - the - art receivers , and upcoming facilities such as the smithsonian submillimeter array ( sma ) , the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) , the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) , and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will provide additional telescope availability and sensitivity with which to conduct routine , large millimeter - wave surveys of distant galaxies in a variety of different molecular tracers ( e.g. , co , hcn ) .    for the past few years , we have made use of the owens valley millimeter array ( ovro ) to conduct a co(@xmath2 ) survey of qsos from the palomar - green ( pg ) bright quasar survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) . in the context of this meeting , the motivation for undertaking such a survey is three - fold : first , the rotational transitions of co are tracers of star - forming molecular gas , thus strong co emission from qsos is an indication that their host galaxies have a significant cold molecular component to their interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "massive galaxies that are known to contain such an ism are spiral galaxies and ongoing ir - selected mergers , which typically have molecular gas masses in excess of @xmath12 m@xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , optically - selected , massive elliptical galaxies are intrinsically poor in molecular gas and dust , with typical molecular gas masses @xmath13 m@xmath4 .",
    "second , in addition to fueling star formation , molecular gas in the host galaxy is a potential source of fuel for qso activity .",
    "thus , correlations between the distribution , kinematics and amount of molecular gas and the level of qso activity may eventually aid in understanding the nature of mass accretion processes of qsos .",
    "third , there exists the possibility that some ultraluminous ir galaxy mergers ( uligs : defined as having ir luminosities , @xmath14 \\geq 10^{12}$ ] l@xmath4 ) are the evolutionary precursors of qsos ( sanders et al .",
    "in such a scenario , uligs evolve from a molecular gas - rich , dust - enshrouded cool ( i.e. , 25@xmath15 m to 60@xmath15 m flux density ratio , @xmath16 ) ultraluminous phase where vigorous star formation and accretion of significant amounts of mass unto the supermassive nuclear black hole have commenced , to a warm ( @xmath17 ) phase in which agn signatures are visible ( i.e. , bright nuclei with near - ir colors consistent with a reddened qso nucleus and seyfert - like emission - line spectrum ) , then finally to an uv - excess qso .",
    "this latter stage can only occur after significant consumption or clearing of molecular gas and dust from the nuclear region has occured , thus revealing the optical qso nucleus .",
    "given this , co(@xmath2 ) observations of qsos designed to search for residual amounts of molecular gas from an earlier ulig phase may enable a direct comparison with the molecular gas content of ir luminous galaxy mergers .",
    "in order to better facilitate comparisons with ir luminous galaxies , it was necessary to select a qso sample for which accurate determinations of @xmath7 could be made ( i.e. , qsos that have _ iras _ detections at mid and far - ir wavelengths ) . the sample was thus chosen from a @xmath0 ir - excess ( i.e. ir to `` big blue bump '' luminosity ratio , @xmath18 > 0.36 $ ] ) sample of 18 pg qsos compiled by surace & sanders ( 2001 ) .",
    "the ir - excess criteria of the sample thus selects the most likely `` transition '' candidates between the dust - enshrouded ulig phase and the optical , uv - excess qso phase .",
    "while selecting qsos with ir excesses introduces a bias , it must be remembered that 2040% of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath19 , of pg qsos is emitted at ir wavelengths ( sanders et al . 1989 ) , thus the present sample of 18 qsos simply populate one extreme of a fairly narrow `` ir luminosity fraction '' distribution .",
    "still , the _ iras _ detection rate of spiral galaxies and ongoing mergers versus optically - selected elliptical galaxies is very high , and if the host galaxies of qsos are a mixture of the above galaxy types , the `` ir - excess '' criteria will be biased towards selecting qsos hosts that are spiral galaxies and ongoing mergers .",
    "the sample of 18 qsos contains two qsos ( mrk 1014 = pg 0157 + 001 and i zw 1 = pg 0500 + 124 ) that have been observed in co multiple times with different millimeter telescopes , and two qsos ( pg 0838 + 770 and 1613 + 658 ) that have been observed once with the iram 30 m telescope ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988a ; barvainis et al . 1989 ; alloin et al .",
    "thus far in the survey , pg 0838 + 770 and 1613 + 658 have been reobserved , and 8 additional ir - excess qsos have been searched for co(@xmath2 ) emission for the first time ( see table 1 ) .",
    "two transits were typically done per source ; in terms of sensitivity , this corresponds to a 3@xmath20 rms molecular gas mass detection limit of @xmath21 m@xmath4 ( assuming @xmath22 m@xmath4 [ k km s@xmath23 pc@xmath10]@xmath23 ) for a @xmath25 galaxy with a co velocity line width of 280 km s@xmath23 .",
    "table 1 lists several properties of the 12 ir - excess qsos observed in co to date , and a co(@xmath2 ) spectrum and integrated intensity map of one qso ( pg 1440 + 356 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "eight qsos have been detected thus far , with molecular gas masses in the range @xmath3 m@xmath4 and velocity line widths ranging from approximately 50 to 500 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the molecular gas mass range of the detected qsos indicates the presence of host galaxies with massive cold molecular components , but the upper limits of the remaining 4 qsos yield inconclusive results .    in order to compare the co(@xmath2 ) and ir properties of these qsos and ir luminous galaxies , @xmath5 versus @xmath7 for both a sample of cool and warm ir galaxies , as well as the ir - excess qsos ,",
    "are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 is commonly referred to as the star formation efficiency ; in starburst galaxies , it is a measure of the cumulative luminosity of massive stars responsible for heating the dust ( @xmath7 ) relative to the amount of fuel available for star formation ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the qsos occupy the upper portion of the @xmath5 distribution of ir luminous galaxies for a given value of @xmath7 ; this is an indication that the qsos contribute significantly to heating the dust in their host galaxies ( thus increasing @xmath7 ) and/or that the dust is heated by massive stars formed in the host galaxy with high efficiency ( per unit molecular gas mass ) .",
    "the latter possibility may indicate that star formation accompanies mass accretion unto supermassive nuclear black holes , and might support recent observed correlations between black hole mass and both stellar bulge mass and velocity dispersion in nearby quiescent galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .    also plotted on figure 2 are the positions the qsos would occupy if the optical qso nucleus was completely enshrouded in dust ( i.e. , if @xmath26 , as is the case for uligs )",
    ". if qsos are the evolutionary products of uligs , and if uligs are powered primarily by embedded qso nuclei , then the area of figure 2 covered by the lines connecting @xmath27 to @xmath5 for the qsos show the possible paths that dust - enshrouded qsos may follow as they evolve towards uv - excess qsos .",
    "this co survey is the first attempt to detect molecular gas in a complete sample of qsos , and it builds upon previous observations of @xmath0 observations of qsos done by other groups .",
    "there are several ways in which such a survey might be improved :    @xmath28 the sample size is presently very small , and it is biased towards ir - excess qsos . a large co survey of a volume - limited sample of qsos would give a more accurate assessment of the diversity in the molecular gas content of qsos .",
    "@xmath28 these observations were done in low - resolution mode ( @xmath29 beam ) for the simple purpose of making co detections of these qsos .",
    "higher resolution ( @xmath30 ) co(@xmath31 ) observations of the detected qsos are required to determine the spatial distribution and detailed kinematics of the molecular gas .",
    "recent co observations by schinnerer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown the co in i zw 1 ( pg 0050 + 124 ) to be extended ."
