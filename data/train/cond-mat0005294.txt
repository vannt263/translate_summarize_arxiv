    "in the last fifteen years there has been a great interest in the study of the growth of surfaces by dynamic processes based in addition and substraction of particles ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the understanding of the conditions under which a growing surface shows a rough structure is nowadays of the greatest importance in the production of thin films and/or pure cristals .",
    "surface growth is usually studied by using lattice models in which simple stochastic rules intend to mimic the relevant phenomena .",
    "their extensive computer simulation have been of a major importance in characterizing and understanding the different morphologies that occur in real experiments .",
    "however , due to the intrinsic limitations of computers capabilities , some very interesting aspects are usually subject to inconclusive analysis and data interpretation .",
    "in particular , let us remark the inherent difficulty in the study of the surface long time behavior and its scaling properties . nevertheless , for this particular aspect , analytical models seem to give us the answers to the questions that the computers fail to clarify .",
    "these are mainly based in postulating a langevin equation for the height of the interface measured from a reference substrate .",
    "such langevin equations intend to mimic the system microscopic dynamics and its collective effect at large scales in space and time .",
    "a general choice has the structure @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the height of the interface at time @xmath2 at the substrate position @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a white noise term . it is generally assumed a one - to - one correspondence between various terms in ( [ general ] ) and different physical processes ( for example see the discusion in @xcite concerning a model for epitaxial growth , or a general method in @xcite to propose an equation such as ( [ general ] ) by using the reparametrization invariance symmetry ) .",
    "the details of the microscopic processes that are assumed to be irrelevant at this scale of observation are taken into account through the values of the coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the properties of the noise term @xmath8 .",
    "once the langevin equation ( [ general ] ) is defined , one may apply renormalization group procedures to obtain different universal properties and scaling behaviors .",
    "the success of this scheme is clearly represented by the definition and analysis of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( kpz ) @xcite which has been a clear breakthrough in the study of the space - time asymptotic behavior of growth models .",
    "quite often surface growth is a consequence of _ bulk _ dynamic processes .",
    "a good example of this is provided by the growth of bacterial colonies where bacteria multiply in a nutrient environment , the shape of the colony being the moving interface @xcite . in general , the dynamics of the particles before and after its aggregation to a substrate may influence the system interfacial behavior .",
    "for instance , it may appear shadowing effects as it happens in dla processes and in thin film growth @xcite , or they may induce different scaling regimes depending on the time interval studied as it is shown in some molecular beam epitaxy models in which a system bulk dynamics is defined @xcite .",
    "however , interface models are usually expressed in terms of a height field , @xmath9 . in doing so ,",
    "bulklike contributions are neglected since only interfacial degrees of freedom are being considered .",
    "unfortunately , the mathematical hurdles to deriving the phenomenological dynamics of interfaces from stochastic bulk microscopic models is formidable , and a comprehensive theoretical picture is still lacking although a significant body of rather rigorous work has been devoted to the subject @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the macroscopic behavior of systems at nonequilibrium states exhibits a strong dependence on the functional structure of its microscopic dynamics ( for instance , in the so - called _ two - temperature ising model _",
    "@xcite one finds that the phase diagram changes radically depending on the analytic form for the probability of a spin - flip ) .",
    "nevertheless , one may expect that this strong relation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic behavior should dissappear near a renormalization group ( rg ) fixed point or in the scaling regime where _ universality _ seems to guarantee that the microscopic details are irrelevant ( at least , one knows that this is true when studying dynamic properties of equilibrium systems near a ( rg ) fixed point @xcite ) . however ,",
    "some recent results on the critical behavior of a nonequilibrium driven diffusive system show that the microscopic dynamics may play a relevant role in the determination of the system universality class @xcite .",
    "the influence of the microsocopic dynamical details into the critical and non - critical properties of a nonequilibrium model implies , in our opinion , that any a priori construction of a langevin equation as ( [ general ] ) may occasionally disregard important features .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a quite general class of nonequilibrium bulk growth models for which the aforementioned problems can be addressed ( there are in the literature some efforts in this direction @xcite ) .",
    "we shall define a stochastic bulk local dynamics expressed by an appropiated continuum master equation in which , for simplicity , only addition of particles is considered . from the master equation and using a truncated kramers - moyal expansion , we shall derive a langevin equation for the bulk degrees of freedom in which there is an explicit dependence on the analytic form of the rates . in order to study surface properties , in a subsequent section we shall derive , from this bulk equation , an expression for the interfacial height field dynamics .",
    "the illustrative example we take is that of the kpz equation and , for consistency , in that particular case we check our results by means of a monte carlo simulation .",
    "some other examples are then briefly commented and our conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "let us consider a particle density field , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and assume that the probability distribution @xmath12 associated with each field configuration obeys the following continuous master equation @xmath13 . \\label{megm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the probability per unit time ( or transition rate ) from one configuration @xmath15 to another @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 . note that the density field , @xmath19 , can only grow in steps of size @xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which @xmath21 is a particle density that results after coarse graining over blocks of size @xmath22 centered around @xmath23 in a lattice .",
    "therefore , the master equation ( [ megm ] ) , so defined , could be thought of as if it only described processes that add one particle per block of the lattice per elementary time step .",
    "this is schematically represented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "next , we choose the transition rates such that @xmath24 namely , they are a function that depends only on the initial configuration @xmath15 and the specific point where mass is added . now , let us assume that @xmath22 is large enough ( tipically , it should be much bigger than any microcopic length scale present in the original physical problem but much smaller than the correlation lenght of the system ) and expand the master equation ( [ megm ] ) on invers powers of @xmath22 .",
    "then , using the expansions    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    we get the so - called kramers - moyal expansion of the master equation ( [ megm ] ) @xcite , @xmath28.\\label{kme}\\ ] ] the next step we take is to keep only the first two terms in ( [ kme ] ) .",
    "then , we can write down the following fokker - planck equation @xmath29\\big(w({\\bf \\rho};{\\bf r})p_t({\\bf \\rho } ) \\big).\\label{fpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to control the goodness of such approximation we appeal to _ kurtz theorem _ @xcite , by virtue of which when @xmath30 , and for a given time @xmath31 then @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are typical time trajectories on phase space which are solutions of the exact master equation ( [ megm ] ) and the fokker - planck one ( [ fpe ] ) respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is a random variable whose distribution does not depend on @xmath22 and satisfying @xmath36 for any constant @xmath37 .",
    "that is , for a given fixed time @xmath38 one can always find a large enough @xmath22 such that the difference between solving exactly the master equation or solving the truncated version of it , is of order @xmath39 and therefore negligible .",
    "moreover , this bound is the best one and no new terms of the kramers - moyal expansion give better results .",
    "however , when @xmath40 one can not control , in general , the accumulated influence of the neglected terms in the expansion .",
    "but , since the study of growth models is manily focused on the undestanding of their evolution properties , due to kurtz s theorem the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) is a valid theoretical starting point .",
    "lastly , the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) is equivalent in the stratonovich sense to the langevin equation @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a white noise with zero mean and @xmath44 .",
    "we recall that @xmath45 is the probability per unit time of adding a particle ( of mass @xmath20 ) at point @xmath46 .",
    "if we considered the posibility of particle substractions then we should do the following substitutions in equation ( [ le ] ) : @xmath47 in the first term and and @xmath48 in the last two terms .",
    "@xmath49 is the probability per unit time of adding ( substracting ) a particle .    before we proceed to the next section ,",
    "let us remark that a ) eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) describes the evolution of the bulk density field of a system that growths by addition of particles with , in principle , no other physical assumptions , and b ) the langevin equation ( [ le ] ) depends directly on the functional form of the bulk rates .",
    "the election of these bulk rates then provides the physical restrictions for the particular growth model that is going to be specifically modelled .",
    "also , it is remarkable that the influence of the bulk dynamics affects the noise term through a nontrivial factor .",
    "we proceed to single out the interfacial degrees of freedom of equation ( [ le ] ) . in order to achieve this , we place two conditions on the solutions of equation ( [ le ] ) .",
    "first , let us impose that our bulk dynamics produces a surface perpendicular to the @xmath50-axis without overhangs and bubbles .",
    "this condition is necessary to ensure that we have a well defined interface ( note that equation ( [ le ] ) contains overhang / vacancy and shadowing effects ) .",
    "secondly , we shall neglect any interfacial profile .",
    "then , we may assume that the solutions of the langevin equation ( [ le ] ) have the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a point in the substrate and @xmath1 is the height of the growing surface at time @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath54 if @xmath55 respectively .",
    "that is , for a given point in the bulk @xmath56 , if its @xmath50 coordinate is larger , equal or smaller than the actual position of the surface , @xmath1 , then the density field is @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "note that since the @xmath60 function is not continuous , when differenciating we should use a regularized version of it , e.g. @xmath61 $ ] with @xmath62 .",
    "we are interested in constructing a dynamical equation for the @xmath1 fields .",
    "therefore , let us make a time derivative in equation ( [ sol ] ) @xmath63 integrating in @xmath50 both sides of equation ( [ dersol ] ) we find @xmath64 equating this expression for @xmath65 , together with ( [ le ] ) , will lead us to the desired langevin equation for the heights .    to make this a bit more concrete , we now introduce a particular set of rates .",
    "for instance , we choose the probability of adding mass to the point @xmath23 to be proportional to the square of the gradient of the density field in that point : @xmath66 . with this election",
    "the unwanted effect of nucleation of bubbles is avoided . after a bit of algebra",
    ", we get @xmath67 which is the celebrated kpz equation with a different noise term ( a naive power counting argument reduces the relevant part of ( [ kpz2 ] ) to the kpz equation ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath68 has the proper dimensions and @xmath69 is positive and depends on how the @xmath60 function is regularized .",
    "this comes from our particular ansatz , but , we would like to stress here that , as far as universal properties are concerned , the precise value of the coefficients is immaterial .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show ( with naive power counting ) that for any bulk dynamics given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 , gives rise to a height equation falling in the kpz universality class .",
    "next , we proceed to check numerically the connection between eq.([megm ] ) with @xmath66 and the kpz equation ( [ kpz2 ] ) .",
    "_ numerical results .",
    "_ the simple bulk rate @xmath72 can be easily implemented in a monte carlo experiment . on a two - dimensional square lattice",
    "periodic boundary conditions are considered in one of the principal axes .",
    "each lattice site is labeled by an occupation variable @xmath73 ranging from @xmath74 to 1 .",
    "a site is empty if @xmath75 and full if @xmath76 .",
    "initially the lattice is empty except for a full horizontal bottom line .",
    "the growth starts when an empty site @xmath23 is chosen at random from the lattice .",
    "then , @xmath73 is increased in @xmath20 with a probability that depends on each nearest neighbour of @xmath23 through @xmath77 .",
    "since symmetrized discrete forms of the gradient operator may give rise to bulk vacancies incompatible with ( [ profile ] ) , we use the following finite - difference formula for the density derivatives @xmath78    @xmath79    that is , left and right derivatives are used alternately to avoid asymmetric effects and , for convenience , a unit lattice spacing is assumed .",
    "the height is defined as the distance to the highest occupied lattice site directly above the substrate coordinate @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the scaling plot for the surface width @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] for different system substrate sizes @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 is the mean height of the interface at time @xmath2 .",
    "the numerical data were averaged over 2000 independent runs for @xmath84 and over 1000 independent runs for @xmath85 . for reasons of computational efficiency the results shown correnspond to @xmath86 .",
    "other values of @xmath22 yield similar results but the simulations are much more time - consuming .",
    "good data colapse is obtained for a roughness exponent @xmath87 and a dynamic exponent @xmath88 , in agreement with the kpz prediction @xcite .",
    "the example we have just provided is by no means unique .",
    "our formalism emcompasses many others well known growth equations .",
    "let us just mention that with the simple dynamics given by @xmath89 the equation of golubovic and wang , related to the anharmonic equilibrium thermal fluctuations of smectics a @xcite , is obtained .",
    "this is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a coefficient and @xmath92 is the curvature ( see @xcite ) . as we have mentioned before",
    ", this kind of dynamics ( proportional to @xmath93 with @xmath71 ) , falls in the kpz universality class .",
    "also , the edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite , which favours growth at local minima , can also be recovered by considering substraction of particles and a rate of the form @xmath94 . in this case",
    ", the formalism has to be slightly modified by linking the election of additon or substraction of particles to the density field configuration .",
    "more explicitely , now the master equation defining the process reads    @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 less , equal and greater than 0 , respectively .",
    "that is , material is added to those areas where the laplacian of the density field is negative and taken from those where it is positive . in this manner , a balanced distribution of mass is achieved that results in the equilibrium edwards - wilkinson universality class .",
    "many other different rates lead to their corresponding growth equations , sometimes to the same one , showing that growth models with similar surface behavior may not have the same bulk properties .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a class of nonequilibrium models in which a stochastic bulk dynamics is defined .",
    "the bulk evolves by an adsorption process represented by a continuum master equation . from it , we have derived a langevin equation for the bulk density field whose structure depends on the details of the underlying bulk dynamics .",
    "this dependence was then extended to an equation of motion for the interfacial degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , we have examplified the procedure by deriving the kpz equation from a very simple bulk rate .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the bulk process confirms the predicted scaling behavior for the interface .",
    "finally , a number of examples were briefly mentioned . in all cases",
    "the bulk dynamics determines the mesoscopic height equation , showing that both scales are related in a non trivial form and that their mutual influence could be far from intuitive .",
    "the strategy developed in this paper is quite general .",
    "it includes both local and nonlocal , and equilibrium and nonequilibrium growth processes .",
    "therefore , a great number of growth physical phenomena can be studied , in principle , with our approach .",
    "for instance , molecular beam epitaxy models with adatom mobility , driven lattice gases or wetting phenomena by means of lattice gas theories of multilayer adsorption , to name just a few .",
