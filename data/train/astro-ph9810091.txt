    "the original goal of the eso slice project ( esp ) redshift survey was essentially twofold .",
    "first , we wanted to produce a measure of the galaxy luminosity function in the `` local '' ( @xmath9 ) universe , with large dynamic range .",
    "second , we wanted to study the clustering of galaxies from a survey hopefully not dominated by a single major superstructure , as it was the case for the surveys available at the beginning of this decade .",
    "while the esp luminosity function and its implications are discussed in detail in @xcite and summarised also in these proceedings by elena zucca , here we shall summarise our results on the two  point correlation properties of galaxies .",
    "the esp survey covers a strip of sky @xmath10 thick ( dec ) by @xmath11 long ( ra ) ( with an unobserved @xmath12 sector inside this strip ) , in the sgp region .",
    "the target galaxies were selected from the edsgc @xcite , and the final catalogue contains 3342 redshifts , corresponding to a completeness of 85% at a magnitude limit @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath14 mpc@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "magnitudes are k  corrected as described in @xcite .",
    "the filled circles in figure  [ xi_mlim_surv ] show computed from the whole esp magnitude  limited sample using the j3weighting technique , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note the smooth decay from the power law at large separations , with correlations going to zero only around @xmath17 , and perhaps some evidence for a positive fluctuation around @xmath18 .",
    "below @xmath19 , tends to flatten .",
    "this is the effect of redshift  space damping from pairs within virialized structures and interestingly it is less prominent when is computed for volume  limited subsamples @xcite . in the same figure , we show from the las campanas ( lcrs , @xcite ) , and apm  stromlo @xcite redshift surveys .",
    "there is a rather good agreement of the three independent data sets between 2 and @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , with perhaps a hint for more power on larger scales in the blue  selected esp and",
    "apm  stromlo .",
    "in addition , the dashed lines describe the real  space obtained by de - projecting the angular correlation function @xmath24 of the apm galaxy catalogue @xcite , for two different assumptions on the evolution of clustering .",
    "it is rather interesting to note the degree of unanimity between the angular and redshift data in indicating both the large  scale shape and the zero - crossing scale ( @xmath25 ) of galaxy correlations .",
    "the small amplitude difference between the redshift and real  space correlations on scales @xmath26 is also remarkable , because it suggests a small amplification of due to streaming flows , and thus a low value of @xmath27 .",
    "redshift distortions produced by peculiar velocities , are usually studied through the function @xcite , that describes galaxy correlations as a function of two variables , one perpendicular ( @xmath28 ) , and the other parallel ( @xmath29 ) , to a sort of mean line of sight defined for each galaxy pair . in figure",
    "[ csipz ] , we show computed for the whole esp survey , using the same technique used for . from this figure , one can clearly see the small  scale stretching of the contours along @xmath29 , produced by the relative velocity dispersion of pairs within structures",
    ".    projecting onto the @xmath28 axis , one gets the function @xmath30 , which is independent from the redshift  distortion field , and is analytically integrable for a power ",
    "law @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", the values of @xmath5 and @xmath32 that best reproduce the data can be evaluated through an appropriate best  fitting procedure . by applying this to the map of figure  [ csipz ]",
    ", we recover @xmath33 mpc and @xmath4 , a value that is slightly smaller than that measured from the red - selected lcrs @xcite .",
    "finally , we have investigated the stability of as a function of the sample mean luminosity , by computing for four volume  limited subsamples .",
    "figure [ wpfit_vlim ] shows the result of the power ",
    "law fit to , evidencing a weak , but significant growth of @xmath34 and @xmath32 when more and more luminous galaxies are selected .",
    "interestingly , this behaviour is completely masked if one looks at @xcite , the reason being the rather different small  scale distortion acting in the four cases , that basically compensates the ( real  space ) growth of clustering .",
    "this shows the importance of separating out dynamical effects when comparing the clustering of different classes of objects through the two  point correlation function .",
