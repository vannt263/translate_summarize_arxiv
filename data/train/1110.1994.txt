    "the phenomenon of gamma ray burst ( grb ) has raised many unresolved issues .",
    "for example , the nature of the compact object in the progenitor responsible for the jet emission is not yet understood .",
    "the widely accepted scenario for the grb emission , supported by strong observational evidences ( van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 ) , is that of a catastrophic energy release from a highly massive , rapidly rotating , low metallicity star towards the end of its life .",
    "this catastrophic process for the long grb class ( t@xmath0 @xmath1 2 s , where t@xmath0 is the time taken by the burst to accumulate between 5% to 95% of its prompt emission ",
    "see kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ; norris et al .",
    "2005 ) is attributed to the collapsar or hypernova scenario ( woosley 1993 ; paczynski 1998 ; fryer et al .",
    "1999 ; mszros 2006 ) while the short grbs ( t@xmath0 @xmath2 2 s ) are thought of as the outcome of merging neutron star binaries or neutron star - black hole binaries ( paczynski 1986 ; meszaros 1992;1997 ; rosswog et al .",
    "2003a ; b ) .",
    "though the collapsar model supports the formation of a stellar mass black hole , it is also suggested that the compact object could be a magnetar ( metzger et al .",
    "2007 ; metzger 2010 ) .",
    "the prompt emission of long grbs shows a wide range of structures in their light curve , though the time integrated energy spectra are adequately fit by a four parameter band model ( band et al . 1993 ) .",
    "attempts have been made to fit the light curve of the prompt emission with empirical models such as the fast rise exponential decay ( fred ) model ( kocevski et al .",
    "2003 ) and the exponential model ( norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these models assume an underlying pulse structure of the prompt emission .",
    "the curve fitting shows that the pulses are nearly simultaneous in a wide range of energy bands ( norris et al .",
    "2005 ) and have self similar shapes ( nemiroff 2000 ) .",
    "hakkila et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that the observed properties of the short pulses of long grbs correlate the same way as typical pulses of short grbs .",
    "all these properties of pulse emission indicate that despite being diverse in their many features , the prompt emission of grb has a simple underlying mechanism of pulse emission which can be characterized by empirical models irrespective of the progenitor or the environment of its formation ( hakkila et al .",
    "2011 ) .    the properties of the prompt emission of grbs like @xmath3 ( the energy at which the emission peaks  amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , the lag between the light curves at two energies ( norris et al .",
    "2000 ) , the average variability seen during the prompt emission ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) , the rise time of the pulses ( schaefer 2002 ) are found to be correlated to the luminosity of the bursts and hence they are used as distance indicators ( schaefer 2007 ; gehrels et al . 2009 ) .",
    "most of these derived relations are empirical in nature and the analyses that are done to derive these parameters , however , are done separately in the time or the energy domain .",
    "for example , to derive @xmath3 the time - integrated spectrum is used , ignoring the time variability and the pulse characteristics . similarly , to derive lags ,",
    "the time profile is examined in a few broad energy bands .",
    "attempts have been made to investigate the variations of these derived parameters in the other domain .",
    "for example , the variation of @xmath3 with time has been investigated by kocevski & liang ( 2003 ) .",
    "a complete empirical description of grb prompt emission which describes the time as well as energy distribution , however , is lacking .",
    "this is probably due to the method of spectral parameter determination which is forward in nature : that is one assumes a possible spectral model , convolves with the detector response and verifies the validity of the model by comparing with the data ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "hence it is difficult to incorporate time variability parameters in this scheme .",
    "grbs often have overlapping pulses which further complicates the extracting of model parameters for any unified empirical description .    in this paper",
    "we develop a technique to give a complete pulse - wise empirical description of the prompt emission of a grb using the time - integrated spectrum and the energy integrated light curve .",
    "we apply this method to the _ fermi_/gbm and the _ swift_/bat data of grb 090618 , which has the highest fluence among all 438 gbm grbs until march 2010 ( nava et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we exploit the large area of _ swift_/bat to get accurate light curves and the large band - width of _",
    "fermi_/gbm to get accurate energy spectra .",
    "we use the band description for the time integrated spectral model ( band 2003 ) and the exponential model ( norris et al .",
    "2005 ) for the energy integrated timing description for the pulses .",
    "we use the expression for the variation of @xmath3 with time given by kocevski & liang ( 2003 ) and develop a method to derive the model parameters ( see section 4.1.2 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that these model parameters correctly describe the variation of pulse width with energy and the variation of the lag with energy . in ",

    "for all the pulses we use a time grid resolution of 0.5 s and energy grid resolution of 2.0 kev .",

    "also , pulse delay characteristics are affected by these overlaps . in such cases",
    "the method described here is very useful .",
    "it takes as input some global parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath17 and @xmath41 ) which are average quantities characterizing the pulse and some constant parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , determines the variable parameter ( @xmath68 ) over the time grids and generates the three dimensional model of the pulse .",
    "note that the timing parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 are determined from the energy integrated light curve and are fixed in our model .",
    "the timing properties of the pulse ( e.g. , width in various energy bands , spectral delay ) are now determined crucially by the evolution of the peak energy .",
    "integration of the three dimensional model in various energy bands generates the light curves in those energy bands .",
    "hence physically we can determine the full width at the 1/e intensity and the peak positions .",
    "we define the spectral delay as the shift in the peak position at each energy band compared to the lowest energy band ( 15 - 25 kev ) .",
    "the derived pulse width and delay are reported in table 3 and table 4 , respectively . in table 3",
    "the numbers in the brackets are the width determined from norris exponential fitting for individual light curves .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison between the measured width following the new method with that determined by fitting the light curve .",
    "we note a systematic decrement of the width measurement by our method for the first two pulses .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that individual pulses rather than co - added pulses are taken into consideration .",
    "hence , measured widths are more accurate and devoid of contamination effects from other pulses .",
    "one of the pulse properties of grb is broadening at lower energies ( norris et al .",
    "1996 , hakkila 2011 ) .",
    "figure 8 ( left panel ) shows the pulse width        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     variation with energy .",
    "while the first two pulses follow the normal trend , we notice that the width for the third and fourth pulses broadens with higher energy .",
    "this can not arise from the contamination of the previous pulse as could have been the argument for fitting the entire light curve . in our case , each pulse is generated and analyzed separately for the width determination .",
    "the energy - width plot of individual pulses is fitted with a linear model .",
    "the slopes are negative for the first two pulses ( @xmath105 s @xmath32 and @xmath106 s @xmath32 respectively ; @xmath30 = 0.13 ( 2 ) and 0.11 ( 2 ) respectively ) and positive for the other two ( @xmath107 s @xmath32 and @xmath108 s @xmath32 respectively ; @xmath30 = 0.0046 ( 2 ) and 0.0021 ( 2 ) respectively ) .",
    "figure 8 ( right panel ) shows a comparison of the slopes meaured by the linear fit of data determined by the two methods ( compare slopes determined in section 3.2 ) .",
    "we note again that the slopes of the first two pulses are convincingly negative ( low error bar ) , but slope of the other two pulses have large error bars . hence",
    ", the evidence of reverse pulse broadening is tentative , though individual pulse analysis in the new method shows a better evidence for the reverse pulse broadening effect ( see figure 8 - left panel ) .",
    "this deviation from the canonical pulse width broadening with energy decrement may have a physical significance . in our analysis physical process of pulse emission",
    "is not considered .",
    "but phenomenologically , this occurs depending on the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a detailed comparison between the first and the third pulse reveals the fact that they have different pulse width variation albeit having nearly similar parameters except for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these values are as follows ( the numbers within parentheses are those of the third pulse ) : @xmath17= -1.11 ( -1.15 ) , @xmath41 = -2.5 ( -2.5 ) , @xmath61=359 ( 324 ) , @xmath62=12.2 ( 18.8 ) , @xmath25=795.4 ( 353.4 ) , @xmath26 = 0.54 ( 2.47 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the main contributing factors for the different width - energy relation are the global values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence we examined for a generic pulse keeping all other parameters fixed at the values of the first pulse and varying @xmath25 for different values of @xmath26 .",
    "figure 9 shows the regions in which pulse broadening or its reverse phenomenon can occur .",
    "this figure is generated by fixing all the parameters other than @xmath25 and @xmath26 to those for the first pulse . for four values of @xmath26",
    "we vary @xmath25 and note the ratio of the width in 100 - 200 kev region ( @xmath109 ) to that in the 15 - 25 kev ( @xmath110 ) region .",
    "the solid line parallel to @xmath25 with @xmath111/@xmath112=1 divides the plot into two regions : ( i ) _ normal width broadening _ region for which @xmath111 < @xmath112 and ( ii ) _ anomalous width broadening _ region for which @xmath111 > @xmath112 .",
    "global values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 falling in the @xmath111 < @xmath112 region will lead to normal pulse broadening ( i.e. , pulse broadens with lower energy ) and vice versa .",
    "we identify from the figure that the @xmath25 and @xmath26 values ( 795.4 and 0.54 respectively ) of the first pulse lie well within the region of _ normal width broadening_. we also note that the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the third pulse ( 353.4 and 2.47 respectively ) lie within the region of _ anomalous width broadening _ despite the fact that the parameter values used , other than @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are those of the first pulse .",
    "this shows how insensitive is the pulse broadening effect with all other parameters and crucially determined by the global values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "another pulse property is the hard - to - soft spectral evolution . in figure 10",
    "we have plotted the model predicted delay as a function of energy ( left panel ) . it can be seen that the spectral time delay always shows a decrement with energy .",
    "the hard x ray always precedes the softer one .",
    "the values for the first three peaks can be compared with the observed delay given in rao et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and this is shown in the right panel of figure 10 .",
    "the time intervals taken by rao et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are @xmath15 to @xmath15 + 50 s , @xmath15 + 50 s to @xmath15 + 77 s , @xmath15 + 77 s to @xmath15 + 100 s , @xmath15 + 100 s to @xmath15 + 180 s. among these the first time bin contains the precursor burst which is not taken in our calculation .",
    "the first and the second pulses are combined in the second time bin . the third pulse is covered in the third time bin .",
    "data of the fourth pulse can not be compared with the time bin as they differ by @xmath4 55 s ( 80 s in time bin as compared to @xmath4 25 s in pulse analysis ) .",
    "the deviation of the model predicted delay from the observed delay can be explained by the fact that the delay in the second time bin ( @xmath15 + 50 to @xmath15 + 77 ) is the combined effect of the first two pulses .",
    "the data for the third time bin agrees within error with the model predicted delay . also , the observed delays are calculated using peak position measurement and cross correlation of the pulses whereas model predicted delays are calculated from peak position measurement alone .",
    "one of the important properties of the prompt emission is that the various measured quantities    ) to the width in 15 - 25 kev ( @xmath112 ) , as predicted by the pulse model , is plotted against @xmath25 for different values of @xmath26 . in the figure maximum as well as the minimum of the curves",

    "the values of @xmath26 are 0.54 , 1.20 , 1.90 , and 2.47 , respectively from left to right .",
    "the @xmath25 values determined for the second and the third pulses of the grb ( 795.4 s and 353.4 s , respectively ) are shown by dash - dotted lines .",

    "correlate with luminosity .",
    "particularly , the peak energy of the @xmath59 spectrum , @xmath3 correlates with isotropic energy @xmath113 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) and also with the peak isotropic luminosity @xmath114 ( yonetoku et al .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2004 ) showed that the correlation is tighter with collimation - corrected energy , @xmath115 .",
    "schaefer ( 2007 ) used a set of 69 grb sample ( up till 7 june 2006 ) with measured redshift to calculate various correlations viz .",
    "lag - luminosity ( @xmath116 ) , variability - luminosity ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , minimum rise time - luminosity ( @xmath120 ) , number of peaks - luminosity ( @xmath121 ) to get distance moduli for each .",
    "weighted average of them gave the distance modulus ( @xmath122 ) which is plotted against the measured redshift ( z ) extending the hubble diagram ( hd ) to z > 6 .",
    "therefore , these correlations can be used to standardize the grb energy budget making grbs a class of cosmic distance indicators .",
    "also , these correlations might point to a underlying fundamental physical process ( yamazaki et al . 2004 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; xu et al . 2005 ; firmani et al . 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ; ghirlanda et al .",

    "2008 ) .    in order to establish the reality of these correlations one must show that all of these correlations hold just as the same way within a single grb as for a sample of many grbs .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2010 ) showed for a set of grbs that the _ time - resolved _ correlations of a single grb are similar to the _ time integrated _ correlations among different grbs .",
    "in the present work we have used the underlying pulse structure to investigate the correlations : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 within the pulses of a single grb .",
    "the correlations are shown in figure 11 .",
    "the mean and the 3@xmath127 scatter of @xmath128 ( top left panel ) and @xmath129 ( top right panel ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2010 ) are shown for reference . as expected",
    ", the @xmath61 values always lie above the mean of @xmath3 values .",
    "it seems that the correlations of @xmath61 with @xmath114 and @xmath130 are rather tighter in our case , though with only three points we can not draw any definite conclusions . while the parameter @xmath61 is a constant",
    ", @xmath3 is an average quantity .",
    "hence , we expect that @xmath61 provides a better pulse description than @xmath3 .",
    "this can be tested in future for correlations of @xmath61 rather than @xmath3 with other quantities in different grbs .",
    "but if the same correlations hold for different grbs then we might conclude ( a ) the correlations are rather physical and not an outcome of the bias in sample selection , ( b ) in a single multi - peaked grb each pulse is generated independently .",
    "we also note that the calculated @xmath114 and @xmath130 are somewhat lower than those calculated by ghirlanda et al .",
    "this must have come from the instrumental effect as noticed earlier .",
    "the normalization of bat is always less than that of _",
    "this leads to a lower flux calculated from the bat spectrum .",
    "we have attempted to explain the timing and spectral variations within a pulse of grb by a simple empirical model and have given a prescription to measure the parameters of this model .",
    "we use simultaneous data from _ swift_/bat and _ fermi_/gbm to determine the average pulse spectral characteristics using the band model .",
    "then we use the integrated light curve from _ swift_/bat to get a simple description of the time evolution using norris exponential model . using these parameters ,",
    "we develop a method to fit the spectrum using xspec table model by assuming that @xmath68 decreases exponentially with fluence in the pulse .",
    "we determine the parameters of the model and then find that these parameters can correctly describe the energy dependence of the pulse characteristics like width and spectral lags .",
    "we also find , in the data , a tentative evidence of _ anomalous width broadening with energy _ for some pulses .",
    "the joint spectral and timing analysis developed here confirms this phenomena for the same pulses at least in the lower energy bands .",
    "the method developed here is applicable for both single pulse and structured grbs .",
    "most of the long grbs are structured which makes them difficult for pulse analysis .",
    "as far as the correlations are concerned , pulse analysis is more indicative than intensity guided time - resolved spectroscopy . hence to draw conclusion regarding these correlations within a sample of grbs and within the pulses of a single grb",
    "we must include these structured grbs with multiple pulses .",
    "kocevski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have prescribed a method for short , clean pulses .",
    "our method extends the domain to all kinds of grbs .",
    "also the present method is much more physical than the time - resolved one in the sense that the individual pulses are treated separately .",
    "hence there wo nt be contamination effects .",
    "the l@xmath131-e@xmath132 looks tighter because correlations within pulses may be more physical than the time - resolved correlation or the time integrated correlations . in future the method developed here",
    "can be used for a large set of grbs ( onto their individual pulses ) to investigate the improvement in the correlations .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the two distinct pulses ( pulse 3 and pulse 4 ) in grb 090618 have e@xmath131 values within a factor of 2 , but widely different e@xmath133 values ( 114 kev and 33 kev , respectively ) .",
    "they will show a huge scatter if used individually for a global correlation .",
    "the e@xmath132 values , on the other hand , are closer to each other and lead to a lower scatter in the correlation ( see figure 11 , top right panel ) .",
    "hence we suggest that the empirical relations are intrinsic to the emission mechanism of grbs and e@xmath132 values , instead of e@xmath133 , should be the correct parameter to be used for correlation studies .",
    "the method described in this paper is quite generic in the sense that any empirical description of the spectrum and its evolution with time can be tested against the data and the derived parameters can be used for global correlation studies .",
    "for example the band spectrum is derived from an extensive study of data from _ cgro_/batse , which is primarily sensitive above 50 kev ( band et al .",
    "extension of the data to lower energies in fact requires additional features .",
    "for example a time resolved spectral study of grb  041006 using _",
    "hete-2 _ data covering the energy range of 2 kev  400 kev , indicated the presence of soft components , each of them having distinctive time evolution ( shirasaki et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we emphasize again here that the use of different instruments can help in pinning down the systematics , identifying additional spectral components and developing an empirical spectral formalism . the simultaneous data from _ swift_/bat and",
    "_ fermi_/gbm have the potential to explore the existence of additional components because the highly sensitive bat has an energy range ( @xmath415 kev  200 kev ) which is a subset of the gbm energy range .",
    "our joint analysis of bat and gbm data has shown that in the 20  40 kev region there is a distinct discrepancy .",
    "this could be due to a ) systematic errors in each of the detectors , b ) presence of additional components or c ) an interplay of both these .",
    "since the spectral fitting method used in xspec is forward in nature ( that is fold the assumed spectrum and compare with the data - see arnaud 1996 ) , the derived spectral parameters will have strong bias of the bandwidth of the detectors , particularly for such low resolution spectral data .",
    "hence a joint fitting of data with good overlap will result in a better estimate of the parameters . in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a method to test empirical descriptions of the energy spectra and their evolution with time in grbs and to derive the underlying physical parameters .",
    "this is the first attempt in this different approach to study various parameters and predict quantities like spectral delay and pulse width of individual pulses in a grb .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc online service , provided by the nasa / gsfc , in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",

    "<S> we develop a new method for simultaneous timing and spectral studies of gamma ray burst ( grb ) prompt emission and apply it to make a pulse - wise description of the prompt emission of grb  090618 , the brightest grb detected in the fermi era . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the large area ( and sensitivity ) of _ swift_/bat and the wide band width of _ fermi_/gbm to derive the parameters for a complete spectral and timing description of the individual pulses of this grb , based on the various empirical relations suggested in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this empirical model correctly describes the other observed properties of the burst like the variation of the lag with energy and the pulse width with energy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements also show an indication of an _ increase _ in pulse width as a function of energy at low energies for some of the pulses , which is naturally explained as an off - shoot of some particular combination of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these model parameters , particularly the peak energy at the beginning of the pulse , are the natural choices to be used for correlation with luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these results for the use of grbs as standard candles are briefly described . </S>"
