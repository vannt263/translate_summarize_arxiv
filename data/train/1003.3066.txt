    "however , we expect that @xmath154 and @xmath161 may exhibit some common features of the polarized structure functions of spin-@xmath4 hadrons in the nonperturbative region when the coupling is large .",
    "* phenomenologically , we can just regard @xmath122 as a free parameter , which can be fixed by the experimental values of the `` neutron '' magnetic moments .",
    "the detailed discussion and fitting results can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "through introducing the pauli interaction term in the action in the @xmath37 space , using gauge / string duality , we have calculated the structure functions of the `` neutron '' which is dual to a spin-@xmath4 dilatino which is neutral corresponding to the @xmath162 current we are considering .",
    "we obtain both the unpolarized and polarized structure functions .",
    "we find the structure functions of the `` neutron '' purely from pauli interactions are power suppressed at the same order as the ones of the `` proton '' purely from minimal interactions .",
    "we also find that the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule for @xmath161 which is satisfied independent of @xmath14 and @xmath11 in the minimal interaction is broken due to such a pauli interaction term .",

    "in this appendix , we will illustrate how a pauli interaction term can be produced from kaluza - klein reduction of higher dimensional fermion - graviton coupling .",
    "since it is only an illustration , for simplicity , let us just consider the reduction from 6d to 5d .",
    "we start with the simple example of a left chiral fermion field in 6d with the sixth dimension @xmath163 compactified .",
    "the action reads @xmath164where we have suppressed the pure graviton self - interaction and @xmath165 it should be noted that the coefficient @xmath166 can be generally complex . in the following , we use the capital @xmath167 in the six - dimension space and the lower @xmath168 in the five - dimensional space .",
    "we will use indices @xmath169 to denote all six general curved spacetime dimensions , and @xmath170 refer to all six local inertial spacetime dimensions , while @xmath171 denote five dimensions in @xmath43 and @xmath172 refer to five dimensions in the local flat five - dimensional spacetime .    following the formalism of kaluza - klein ,",
    "we write the vielbein field as @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 and we have set the scalar field simply as 1 and neglected the dimension of the field .",
    "all the components in eq.([vielbein ] ) do not depend on the sixth dimension coordinate @xmath163 .",
    "we make the split of @xmath175-matrices @xcite as @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the d=5 @xmath179-matrices and usual pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "we also decompose the spinor field as @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the spinor in d=5 , and @xmath182 is the spinor in d=2 .    using the identity @xmath183 and the specific expressions in eq.([vielbein ] ) , we can have @xmath184 inserting it into the lagrangian in eq.([s ] ) , we can obtain @xmath185where we have taken the fermion to be in a charge eigenstate , @xmath186 in such a way , the action can be rewritten as , @xmath187where we have normalized @xmath188now we can see that the pauli interaction term in @xmath43 space has been produced from higher 6d fermion - graviton interaction by using kaluza - klein reduction . for the uncharged fermion where @xmath189 , only the pauli interaction term will contribute .",
    "the reduction from 10d to 5d will be similar except for more possible complications involved dealing with more extra dimensions , which is beyond the scope of our present work .",
