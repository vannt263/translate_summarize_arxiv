    "previous theoretical and experimental studies concluded that the nacl - type mon and tan were metastable structures @xcite , moreover with a wide range of compositions around the 1:1 metal - to - nitrogen stoichiometry .",
    "namely , the rocksalt tan has been predicted to be stable for n / ta atomic ratio ranging from 0.94 to 1.37 @xcite .",
    "as already proposed , cubic mo - n and ta - n systems can be stabilized by the vacancies introduction @xcite , although a detailed theoretical analysis of the impact of point defects on the phase stability in these two systems is still missing .",

    "our analysis clearly demonstrates that the key difference between @xmath25 and @xmath26 lies in their opposite preference for ordering / disordering vacancies . while the metal vacancies in c - mon favour rather disordered configurations ( differing from ordered and partially ordered by @xmath27 ) , the partially ordered metal vacancies in c - tan exhibit lower values of formation energy up to the concentration @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",

[ eq : alpha ] ) .    , where @xmath32 are the sro parameters defined by eq .  [ sro_parameter].,width=302 ]",
    "we have carried out detailed first - principles investigations on the energetics of point defects in cubic b1-type mon and tan .",
    "the results demonstrate a strong tendency for off - stoichiometry in both systems which is in excellent agreement with previous studies on tan , and experimental observations reporting @xmath25 and @xmath26 with 1:1 metal - to - nitrogen stoichiometry as metastable structures .",
    "our calculations indicate that phase stability can be largely affected by the vacancies formation . although the fact , that defected structures are more stable than their perfect parent phases , is fascinating on its own , we have additionally newly revealed differences in ordering tendencies of point defects in both , mo - n and ta - n systems .",
    "namely , metal vacancies in concentration @xmath33 result in the most stable composition ta@xmath34n , while @xmath35 of metal vacancies or @xmath36 of n vacancies , i.e. mo@xmath37n or mon@xmath38 , is found the most favourable for mo - n system .",

    "an array of n deficient compounds is predicted , with n content rapidly decreasing ( from @xmath41 to @xmath42 concentration in the sublattice ) as approaching the strong n - poor conditions . in the mo - n case , only four stable compositions are predicted , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the stability regions are shown to be evenly distributed between n over- and under - stoichiometric structures .",
    "the predicted metastable configurations of metal - deficient mon and tan are predicted to tend to disorder and order , respectively .",
    "finally , strong dependence of the cubic lattice parameter on the actual composition was clearly demonstrated and a compositional dependence of the cubic lattice parameter on the vacancy content was provided",
