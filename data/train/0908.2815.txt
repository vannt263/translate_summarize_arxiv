    "we consider a system of @xmath0 identical bosons which interact by attractive central pair potentials @xmath2 .",
    "there is no restriction in general concerning the number @xmath3 of spatial dimensions , but , for definiteness in the presentation , we shall assume @xmath4 we suppose that the potential has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the coupling parameter , @xmath8 is the shape of the potential , and @xmath9 is a range parameter .",
    "the salpeter semirelativistic hamiltonian for a system of @xmath0 identical bosons of mass @xmath10 and individual momenta @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 our principal goal is to find or estimate @xmath15 , the lowest energy of this system .",
    "the ease with which the @xmath0-body problem can be posed in the salpeter theory is the main reason for our adopting the semirelativistic approach . for suitable potentials ,",
    "the hamiltonian is bounded below and to a certain extent the spectral theory mimics the corresponding schrdinger theory @xcite .",
    "one path to a lower bound is to exploit the boson permutation symmetry of the exact normalized ground state @xmath16 to effect a ` reduction ' generated by the equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hamiltonian for a specially scaled one - body problem .",
    "a lower bound to @xmath15 is then given by the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath19 such reductions have a long history which is reviewed briefly in ref .",
    "different reductions are possible and lead to a variety of lower bounds .",
    "for example , we obtain immediately from eq.([eq1 ] ) @xmath20 where @xmath21.\\ ] ] the reduction is not yet complete since @xmath22 is the hamiltonian for a scaled two - body problem . if we adopt new coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 for this problem",
    ", we find @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus if we write @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 then an application of the triangle inequality yields @xmath32 thus we have the spectral inequalities @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath36 and provides a lower bound to @xmath15 , the ground - state energy of @xmath37 we note that this use of the triangle inequality is equivalent to setting the centre - of - mass momentum @xmath38 of the two - body hamiltonian @xmath22 to zero .",
    "for boson systems there may be an energy advantage ( leading to a higher lower bound ) if , from the outset , jacobi ( orthogonal ) relative coordinates can be accommodated by the reduction scheme .",
    "intuitively , the use of relative coordinates allows us to remove the centre - of - mass kinetic energy of the whole system , rather than dropping the centre - of - mass energy only at the final stage , after the reduction to a scaled two - body problem such as @xmath39 one way of achieving this for the salpeter problem involves squaring the reduced one - body salpeter equation of the form @xmath40 this allows us to invoke some remarkable expectation identities for jacobi coordinates : these identities , which we shall refer to explicitly below , are proved in appendix  a.    since we use relative coordinates both for the upper and lower bounds , in section  2 we define the jacobi coordinates @xmath41 and note some key properties .",
    "an upper energy bound @xmath42 is provided by an application of a normalized gaussian trial function @xmath43 . this latter calculation",
    "is greatly simplified by the boson permutation symmetry of @xmath43 and also by the fact that this particular trial function is not only symmetric under the permutation of the relative coordinates but also factors in the form @xmath44 .",
    "the upper bound is discussed in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we introduce a variant of the jacobi system suitable for the derivation of a lower bound expressed in terms of a klein ",
    "gordon one - particle problem .",
    "the proof assumes that this klein  gordon problem has a discrete eigenvalue that is either ( i ) positive or ( ii ) monotone increasing as a function of the mass . in section  5",
    "we consider the example of the attractive exponential potential .",
    "since boson permutation symmetry is naturally expressed in terms of the individual - particle coordinates @xmath45 , it might seem an unwelcome complication to introduce relative coordinates @xmath46 their advantage arises when we consider the reduction @xmath47 , where @xmath18 is a scaled one - body problem .",
    "jacobi relative coordinates may be defined with the aid of an orthogonal matrix @xmath48 transforming old @xmath49 to new @xmath50 coordinates by @xmath51=b[\\mb{r}].$ ] the first row of @xmath52 with  all entries @xmath53 defines a centre - of - mass variable @xmath54 its second a pair distance @xmath55 and the @xmath56th row ( @xmath57 ) first has @xmath58 entries @xmath59 the @xmath56th entry @xmath60 and zero for all remaining entries .",
    "the momenta @xmath61 conjugate to the @xmath50 read @xmath62=(b^{-1})^{\\rm t}[\\mb{p}]=b[\\mb{p}].$ ] now , for an @xmath0-boson problem with an attractive potential @xmath63 let @xmath64 be the exact normalized ground - state eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest energy @xmath65 boson permutation symmetry is a powerful constraint that greatly reduces the complexity of this problem .",
    "although a non - gaussian wave function is not necessarily symmetric in the jacobi coordinates , we do have the remarkable @xmath0-representability expectation expressions from appendix a :  for @xmath66 @xmath67",
    "we now take advantage of the special properties of the gaussian trial function @xmath43 to effect an upper reduction of @xmath68 . in the centre - of - mass frame of the @xmath0-body system , where @xmath69 , we have from the last row of the matrix @xmath48 @xmath70 meanwhile our trial wave function @xmath43 is not only a boson function but it is also symmetric and factors in the relative coordinates .",
    "we have explicitly : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a variational scale parameter .",
    "the boson permutation symmetry of the trial function allows us to write @xmath73 where we have    @xmath74\\phi\\right).\\ ] ] setting @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we find @xmath77 , where @xmath78 we now introduce some new parameters which will allow us to express both the upper and lower energy bounds in compatible succinct forms . with @xmath5 @xmath79 and @xmath34 , we now define @xmath80 the gaussian upper bound then becomes @xmath81    we note parenthetically here that , if the same scaling is used for the reduced hamiltonian @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , the result @xmath82 is comparable with @xmath83 and is given by @xmath84 we shall use this later in the paper to show that the @xmath85 bound is weak : we shall consider @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath82 , and observe ( in particular cases ) that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the klein  gordon lower bound that we shall derive in the next section ; hence , for these problems , we know , without calculating @xmath87 , that @xmath90 .",
    "however , our main point here is that the upper energy bound can be written in terms of an optimized expectation ( with respect to a gaussian wave function ) of a special one - particle salpeter problem with hamiltonian @xmath91 the kinetic - energy expectation value may be expressed in terms of the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath92 @xcite . evaluating the integral , for convenience , in momentum space , yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 and the integral @xmath95 is defined  by @xmath96 meanwhile",

    "the expression for the energy now has the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 the hamiltonian @xmath18 is bounded below by the simple bound @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "this result is a consequence of the inequality @xmath119 we now consider the eigenequation @xmath120 where @xmath121 retains some of the boson permutation symmetry implications of the full wave function , namely from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath122 @xmath123 and hence @xmath124 let @xmath125 be the minimum of @xmath126 corresponding to normalized @xmath127 satisfying ( [ eq12 ] ) and let @xmath16 be the exact normalized @xmath0-body wave function , then @xmath128 the eigenvalue equation for @xmath125 reads @xmath129 squaring these equal vectors and use of ( [ eq12 ] ) , and also the scaling change ( to new dimensionless variables ) @xmath130 , implies @xmath131    in contrast to our upper bound , where we worked directly with the salpeter hamiltonian ( [ eqhg ] ) , for the lower bound we are led to consider a complementary lower klein  gordon operator .",
    "if the minimization on the right - hand side of ( [ salai ] ) could be effected exactly ( as it can for the gravitational problem @xmath132 @xcite ) , then it would remain to extract a lower bound to @xmath125 from the resulting inequality . for the general problem that we are considering here",
    ", we have to find another approach . to this end",
    "we have explored what happens if we set @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ salai ] ) , and solve the resulting klein  gordon equation for the ground - state energy @xmath134 this klein ",
    "gordon equation is given explicitly by @xmath135 this exercise is only useful if an _ a priori _ relation can be established between @xmath136 and @xmath125 .",
    "more particularly , we shall now establish a relationship between @xmath136 and the lower bound to @xmath125 provided by the inequality given in eq .",
    "( [ salai ] ) .",
    "we employ a similar parameter set to that for the upper bound , that is to say @xmath79 and @xmath34 , and also @xmath137 we thus arrive at the klein ",
    "gordon equation in a standard form , namely @xmath138 and , equivalently , in schrdinger form @xmath139 the spectral function @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( [ kgs ] ) describes , for each fixed coupling @xmath141 , how the lowest eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath142 depends on the energy parameter @xmath89 ; the klein ",

    "gordon energy @xmath151 to be a lower bound to the corresponding salpeter energy @xmath152 . ,",
    "width=453 ]    similarly , the original lower - bound inequality ( [ salai ] ) becomes an equality in terms of the parameters ( [ params ] ) and also a new mass parameter @xmath153 used here as a ` slack variable ' .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath154 in earlier work @xcite on the semirelativistic and klein  gordon _ one_-body problems ,",
    "we have proved that , under appropriate assumptions , the klein ",
    "gordon energy is monotone in the mass .",
    "more specifically , in our application , we can state this result in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eqslack ] ) , namely , for each fixed @xmath155 if either @xmath156 , or @xmath157 and @xmath158 then @xmath159 thus , under these conditions ( which must be verified for each potential ) , we have from eqs .",

    "gordon bound @xmath89 is better than the @xmath85 bound , that is to say @xmath183 moreover , we see from table  1 that for large @xmath0 , the klein  gordon lower bound is in fact much better than the @xmath85 bound .    the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath189 , which is perhaps meaningful in the spinless salpeter theory , has no useful counterpart expressed by the klein  gordon equation .",
    "the salpeter hamiltonian in this limit ( and for the exponential example ) becomes @xmath190 this problem is not very different qualitatively from the corresponding schrdinger problem @xmath191 , which also has a discrete eigenvalue for every @xmath192 not too small .",
    "by contrast , the klein ",
    "gordon equation ( [ ekexp ] ) with @xmath193 implies @xmath194 , and leads to the schrdinger problem @xmath195 which has a solution only for very particular @xmath141 not too small .",
    "clearly , the klein  gordon lower bound is not useful for the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "we consider first a one - body problem with an attractive ( vector ) potential @xmath196 in three spatial dimensions .",
    "we contrast four theories : dirac , klein ",
    "gordon , salpeter , and schrdinger . for the singular coulomb or gravitational case @xmath132",
    ", all four theories agree that binding is obtained for arbitrarily small @xmath197 .",
    "meanwhile , the three relativistic theories agree that the coupling @xmath197 can not be very large : we have for dirac @xmath198 for klein  gordon @xmath199 and for salpeter @xmath200 for these three relativistic theories , the discrete eigenvalues are all positive and the supercritical phenomenon that we discuss below does not arise .",
    "none - the - less , the coupling restrictions lead to limitations on the system size , as we have discussed earlier for a static - gravity boson - star model @xcite .",
    "we now set aside the coulomb case and consider bounded short - range potentials such as the exponential potential @xmath165 discussed in the previous section .",
    "for this class of problems , the four theories now agree that ( in three dimensions ) binding is obtained only for @xmath197 sufficiently large .",
    "the term ` critical coupling ' is used for the coupling value @xmath201 , in each theory , beyond which a discrete eigenvalue appears .",
    "as @xmath197 is increased further , this eigenvalue decreases . in the fully relativistic theories another critical value @xmath202",
    "is reached at which @xmath203 this situation is called ` supercriticality ' and @xmath204 is the corresponding supercritical coupling .",
    "the relativistic dirac and klein  gordon theories will not accommodate larger couplings than their particular supercritical values .",
    "by contrast , for the salpeter and schrdinger cases , as @xmath197 is increased , the eigenvalues simply decrease without lower limit .",
    "it is now clear that if we use the klein ",
    "gordon eigenvalue to bound the salpeter eigenvalue below , a limitation is introduced which was not originally present in the salpeter problem itself , namely that the coupling should not be very large .",
    "one could perhaps argue that , just as the restriction @xmath205 , which emerges internally and technically from the theory of the klein ",
    "gordon equation , is ` understood ' in terms of another theory , namely pair creation in quantum field theory ; thus , significance of this constraint could be acquired by the salpeter theory from the klein  gordon theory .",
    "all we are saying here is that , if the salpeter theory claims to be partially relativistic , then it is natural to impose the condition that @xmath205 , or , what is sufficient , that @xmath197 not be too large . using the klein ",
    "gordon theory to bound salpeter below achieves this automatically . in terms of the @xmath0-body reductions discussed in this paper , this means that the scaled coupling @xmath206 should not be too large . since @xmath207 this means , for a given pair interaction , that the particle number @xmath0 , in turn , should not be too large .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that such relativistic systems in their ground states will not become giant balls as @xmath0 is increased , but will divide into smaller aggregates . for the exponential example with @xmath208 @xmath209 @xmath197 small and @xmath0 large so that @xmath210 we have from table  1 , @xmath211 which is to say , @xmath212",
    "thus we conclude that a phenomenon which seemed to be a special feature of the @xmath213 potential may be more widely present in relativistic many - body systems .",
    "the principal disadvantage of the semirelativistic salpeter equation is that it is not fully relativistic .",
    "it perfectly well accommodates the harmonic oscillator , a strong interaction not at all tolerated ( as a vector potential ) by the klein  gordon or dirac theories .",
    "moreover , the salpeter hamiltonian is non - local , and this introduces technical problems for spectral estimation .",
    "the main advantages of the salpeter theory are ( i ) the ease with which the relativistic many - body problem can be formulated and ( ii ) the fact that the energy spectrum is characterized , and may therefore be estimated , variationally . for a wide class of attractive pair potentials that vanish at infinity ,",
    "we have shown in this paper that jacobi relative coordinates and the permutation symmetry of the boson states allow us to construct ground - state energy bounds in terms of certain reduced one - body problems : the lower bound is provided by the ground - state energy of a klein  gordon problem ; and the upper bound is given by the expectation of a salpeter hamiltonian with respect to a scale - optimized gaussian trial function .",
    "these bounds may well have theoretical as well as computational applications .",
    "for example , as @xmath0 increases , the effective potential coupling @xmath141 in the scaled one - body klein  gordon problem ( [ kg1 ] ) increases by the factor @xmath214 whereas the kinetic - energy term remains unchanged .",
    "even for bounded potentials , such as the exponential potential , this implies that this lower - bound klein ",
    "gordon problem will , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , become supercritical , with @xmath215 .",
    "this may , in turn , indicate that the @xmath0-body problem will not be stable for large aggregates , and will necessarily break up into smaller fragments",
    ". this would be the expression of a truly relativistic many - body phenomenon with no pre - image in non - relativistic theories .",
