    "population studies of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have led to a number of interesting results , using the advantage of its known distance . the period ",
    "luminosity relation for mira variables was deduced from photometric monitoring of long period variables ( lpvs ) in the lmc ( feast et al .",
    "objective prism survey studies of the lmc showed a clear lack of carbon stars amongst the most luminous agb stars ( @xmath1m@xmath2 mag ; see iben 1981 for a review ) .",
    "these studies have been largely based on samples of optically visible agb stars ( e.g.  blanco et al .  1980 ; cohen et al .  1981 ; westerlund et al.1981 ) .",
    "stars near the tip of the agb experience mass - loss rates as high as @xmath3 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , giving rise to circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) in which dust forms , making them optically thick at optical wavelengths .",
    "hence these agb stars may only be observable at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths and were missed in earlier studies .",
    "samples of candidate obscured agb stars in the lmc have only recently become available ( reid 1991 ; wood et al .",
    "1992 ; zijlstra et al .",
    ". the agb nature of some of these stars still needs to be confirmed , and their ( circum-)stellar properties are yet to be explored in detail . the small existing samples should be extended both in number and in ( circum-)stellar parameter space , to allow a population study of mass - losing agb stars in the lmc",
    ".    in paper  i ( loup et al .",
    "1997 ) we constructed an iras - selected sample of agb and post - agb star candidates . in paper  ii",
    "( zijlstra et al.1996 ) we confirmed the agb nature for a subsample thereof , on the basis of their bolometric luminosities and their near - ir ( nir ) and iras colours .",
    "we also showed that the chemical type  oxygen or carbon star  may be deduced from the position of a mass - losing agb star in the k[12 ] versus h  k diagram .",
    "considering the difficulty of obtaining spectra of these stars , the ir colour diagnostics are a powerful tool in determining the nature of the ir stars ( e.g.  van der veen & habing 1988 ; guglielmo et al .",
    "1993 ; le bertre 1993 ; le sidaner & le bertre 1994 ; loup & groenewegen 1994 ) .    here , in paper  iii of our series on the study of obscured agb stars in the magellanic clouds , we present the results of a nir search for counterparts of iras point sources in the direction of the lmc , aiming at enlarging the sample of known obscured agb stars in the lmc . after classifying the stars as being mass - losing agb stars , or not",
    ", we briefly comment on their properties .",
    "we discuss not only the agb stars , but also the nature of other positive identifications , and serendipitous detections . amongst them are stars that may be explained as being in the post - agb phase , and we compare their properties with those of a sample of iras - selected post - agb star candidates in the milky way .",
    "we also find a few galaxies , which may be used as probes to measure the interstellar extinction inside the lmc .",
    "for our search for nir counterparts , we reduced the list of nearly 200 best - candidate sources from paper  i to a list of 68 sources , excluding stars that were studied in paper  ii ( except for one source ) .",
    "our selection criteria are either iras flux densities @xmath6 , or @xmath7 and @xmath8 jy .",
    "limited by the available observing time , we finally observed 31 sources .",
    "they were selected mainly amongst the sources that were relatively bright at 12  @xmath9 m , had red [ 12][25 ] colours , and were not affected by cirrus at 60  @xmath9 m .",
    "we adopt [ 12]@xmath10 and [ 12][25]@xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the flux density in jy in the iras 12 and 25  @xmath9 m bands , respectively ( iras explanatory supplement 1988 ) . in the iras",
    "[ 12 ] versus [ 12][25 ] magnitude  colour diagram shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "these 31 sources are represented by shaded circles , whereas the remaining 37 sources are plotted as open circles .",
    "several sources coincide in this diagram , because of the discrete values for the iras flux densities .",
    "the diagram shows that we mostly selected the brighter and slightly redder sources .",
    "we also plotted the agb star candidates ( dots ) and red supergiants ( crosses ) from paper  ii .",
    "the present sample is fainter at 12  @xmath9 m and has a redder [ 12][25 ] colour on average than the agb star candidates from paper  ii , that are themselves fainter at 12  @xmath9 m and have redder [ 12][25 ] colours than the supergiants .",
    "we observed on the clear nights 1/2 and 2/3 january 1996 , using the nir camera irac2 at the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope at la silla , chile .",
    "lens c was chosen to cover a field of view of @xmath14 , with a pixel scale of @xmath15 .",
    "this combines the advantages of a large field of view and a reasonable sampling of the point spread function for doing photometry . for each iras point source field",
    "we did a sequence of 12 images in the k - band filter , each consisting of ten 3-second exposures , shifted by @xmath16 in right ascension with respect to the previous image .",
    "we repeated this procedure backwards , using the j - band filter .",
    "the search is deepest in the @xmath17 centred at the iras point source .",
    "we compared the irac2 fields with the digitized sky survey ( http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss ) , to determine the actual field centres .",
    "the absolute pointing of the telescope was found to be accurate to about @xmath18 , from a comparison of the irac2 field centres and the iras positions used to point the telescope .",
    "we constructed frames that represent a good approximation of the background emission , by median - averaging the shifted images within each sequence , rejecting the brightest pixels to avoid contamination by stars .",
    "the background - subtracted images were flat - field corrected using flatfields obtained by taking an image of a screen in the dome , illuminated by a lamp dedicated for this purpose , and subtracting a similar image with the lamp off .",
    "the individual images were shifted to bring the position of the iras point source back in the centre , by integer number of pixels to ensure flux conservation . finally these images were added together . in this way",
    ", we could detect stars down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath19 mag , and @xmath20 mag . the limiting magnitude varied from field to field by about a magnitude , mainly due to differences in the background .",
    "the standard stars were observed by taking an image consisting of an average of thirty 0.6-second exposures , and another image shifted by @xmath21 .",
    "their difference yields a background - subtracted frame , which we then flat - field .",
    "the standard stars were observed regularly during the night , covering the same air masses as the lmc .",
    "the j and k - band images were blinked to identify the j  k reddest sources . on these , circular aperture photometry was done with an increasing aperture radius , to create a radial magnitude profile of the star .",
    "the same was done for the standard star . from the differential magnitude profile",
    "the magnitude of the program star can be estimated , as well as its accuracy .",
    "the standard stars used are hd38150 ( j@xmath22 mag , k@xmath23 mag ) , sa94702 ( @xmath24 gsc 0004800918 ; j@xmath25 mag , k@xmath26 mag ) , and hd52467 ( j@xmath27 mag , k@xmath28 mag ) .",
    "these magnitudes are in the saao system ( cf .",
    "carter 1990 ) , and the irac2 magnitudes have been converted to the saao system using relations derived by lidman ( 1995 ) on a single test night : @xmath29 the 1-@xmath30 errors are 0.012 and 0.015 on the coefficients for the j@xmath31 and k@xmath31 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the conditions during the observations were photometric .",
    "extinction corrections were found to be 0.05 mag air - mass@xmath5 in the j - band , and 0.03 mag air - mass@xmath5 in the k - band on the first night , and twice as large on the second night .",
    "the relative humidity , dome temperature , and seeing were about 6070% , @xmath32c , and 0.70.8@xmath33 on the first night , and about 4060% , 1512@xmath34c , and 0.71@xmath33 on the second night .",
    "we observed on the clear night 24/25 , and the partially cloudy night 30/31 december 1996 , using the direct imaging camera at the dutch 0.9 m telescope at la silla , chile .    on the first night , we imaged two @xmath35 fields centred on the galaxies that we detected in the nir close to the iras point sources li  lmc0603 and li ",
    "lmc1818 ( see below ) .",
    "the night was photometric , although the moon was close to opposition .",
    "we took six images in the bessel b - band , and three images in the bessel r - band , all 200 seconds integration time per frame .",
    "stellar images on these frames had fwhm of typically 1.1@xmath331.4@xmath33 .",
    "the images were calibrated by stars in the landolt ( 1992 ) standard star field sa98 that were observed close in time and airmass to the galaxy fields .",
    "hence the b and r magnitudes are on the photometric systems of johnson and kron - cousins , respectively .",
    "we obtained integrated magnitudes for the galaxies and the few redmost stars in the fields , using aperture photometry and applying aperture corrections derived from the much less crowded standard star fields .    on the second night , we measured the bright stellar counterpart ( see below ) of li ",
    "lmc1821 in the bessel b , v , and r - bands , and the gunn i - band .",
    "the night was cloudy , and useful photometry could only be obtained by rapidly switching back and forth between the star and @xmath36 dor (= hr2194 ) , an a0 main sequence star of v@xmath37 and b ",
    "v@xmath38 mag at 1.5 degree separation , until stable and well - defined magnitudes could be determined .",
    "the b , v , and r magnitudes that we obtained for li ",
    "lmc1821 are on the johnson photometric system , whereas the i magnitude is on the gunn photometric system .",
    "we estimated the gunn i - band magnitude for @xmath36 dor to be i@xmath39 mag .",
    "integration times were 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.2 , and 0.5 seconds for bvri respectively .",
    "to avoid problems with shutter delay times for these short integration times , we used the same integration times for both stars , and they were always positioned at the same place on the ccd .",

    "if we assume that , down to a certain lower bolometric luminosity limit we are equally incomplete for the currently available samples of mass - losing agb stars ( combining paper  ii with this paper ) , post - agb stars , and pne then we can , in principle , estimate their relative lifetimes .",

    "k diagram for galactic oxygen stars does have some overlap with the vhg-89 stars , but the latter are mostly found having larger k[12 ] .",
    "this can be partly due to larger optical depths of the cses of the vhg-89 stars , to the extent that the cse becomes optically thick in the k - band , but it can not explain the position of the vhg-89 class iv at small j  k .",
    "probably the vhg-89 stars have more massive cses , yielding a larger 12  @xmath9 m flux , but these cses are detached , yielding small column densities towards the star and hence small j  k .",
    "consequently , stars at the secondary sequence are not expected to evolve directly into stars with larger k[12 ] .",
    "if the stars from vhg-89 are post - agb stars , then they are expected to have evolved from large j  k and k[12 ] , first getting smaller j ",
    "k before also getting smaller k[12 ] . hence the secondary sequence may be related to the vhg-89 class i only .",
    "the fact that we noticed a secondary sequence , rather than a gradient from the primary sequence into the vhg-89 areas of the k[12 ] versus j  k diagram , suggests that the secondary sequence and perhaps the vhg-89 class i are not related to the vhg-89 post - agb classes ii  iv .",
    "we can explain them instead as stars that only temporarily stopped losing mass , possibly as a result of a thermal pulse ( tp ) .",
    "they are then expected to return to the agb and resume heavy mass loss ( zijlstra et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "it is difficult to discern a tp star from a post - agb star , since both experience the same phenomenon : the cse becomes detached .",
    "but at least statistically there are differences to be expected , that can be observed in the near- and mid - ir : the k[12 ] is expected to be statistically larger for a post - agb star than for a tp star .",
    "there are three reasons for this . first , post - agb stars shrink while maintaining the same bolometric luminosity , and therefore they must increase in effective temperature . this results in increased heating of the cse , counteracting at least partly the cooling of the cse as a result of its increasing distance to the star .",
    "tp stars do not change as much in effective temperature , and hence the detaching cse of a tp star cools more rapidly than that of a post - agb star .",
    "second , as the effective temperature increases but not the bolometric luminosity , the star will become fainter in the k - band , increasing its k[12 ] colour . although tp stars may have decreased in bolometric luminosity , this is expected to be at most one magnitude ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "third , post - agb stars are more evolved than tp stars . they have experienced mass loss for a longer time span , yielding more massive cses and consequently larger 12  @xmath9 m fluxes .",
    "lmc0530 has too small a [ 12][25 ] colour for its k[12 ] colour to be a normal post - agb star candidate , relative to both the vhg-89 stars and the six lmc post - agb star candidates discussed above .",
    "it is also much brighter in the k - band than the other lmc post - agb star candidates , which suggests an optically thin cse .",
    "whitelock et al.(1995 ) found two stars in the south galactic cap that they explained as tp stars , because of their lack of variability .",

    "in fact these galactic tp star candidates are more similar to normal mass - losing agb stars .",
    "this can be understood if they experienced one of their first tps , before they had built up a massive cse that yields a significant 12  @xmath9 m excess .",
    "lmc0530 seems to take an intermediate position between post - agb stars and tp stars .",
    "lmc0530 is identified with the lpv shv0510004692755 : an lpv with an i - band amplitude of 1.24 mag and a period of 169 days .",

    "it obeys the period - luminosity relation for the k - band magnitude perfectly , although bolometrically it is 45 times more luminous than the agb stars that define the period - luminosity relation ( reid et al .",
    "lmc0530 must have been a mass - losing agb star in the past , because it has a large 12  @xmath9 m excess .",
    "it may now be pulsating in a ( high ) overtone , and maybe it will resume mira variability and mass loss . if it is a post - agb star at present , then it must be in a very early post - agb stage , because its effective temperature has not increased much .",

    "<S> we have searched for near - infrared stellar counterparts of iras point sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , in j- and k - bands . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted in the detection of 21 counterparts , of which 19 are new discoveries . </S>",
    "<S> using colour  magnitude and colour  colour diagrams , we identify 13 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with thick circumstellar dust envelopes , 7 possible early post - agb stars or stars recovering from a thermal pulse , and 1 red supergiant or foreground star . for 10 of the iras targets we do not succeed in detecting and/or identifying a near - infrared counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we serendipitously detect 14 other red sources , of which 2 are known long period variables , and a few galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the near - infrared and optical colours of the galaxies may indicate considerable interstellar extinction through the lmc , as much as @xmath0 24 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the relative number of agb carbon stars over oxygen stars is shown to decrease as the luminosity increases . yet amongst the faintest mass - losing agb stars oxygen - rich stars still exist , which puts constraints on current convection theories that predict the occurrence of third dredge - up and hot bottom burning . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the nature of some lmc stars that have infrared properties very similar to suspected galactic post - agb stars . </S>"
