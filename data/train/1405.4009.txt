    "the first phase of lhc operation have achieved the intensive and comprehensive new physics searches .",
    "the searches have so far only seen agreement between the standard model ( sm ) and data , which in tern placed stringent constraints on beyond the standard models ( bsms ) . especially , r - parity conserved minimal supersymmetric sm ( rpc mssm ) is severely constrained due to luck of events in the large missing energy channels , and the gluino mass in rpc mssm is constrained up to about 1  tev  @xcite .    the stringent limit on the gluino mass in the mssm can be modified if r - parity violation ( rpv ) is introduced @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the lsp can decay promptly into visible particles , trading the large missing energy signature with large multiplicity of jets and leptons .",
    "the rpv scenario which is the most difficult to be searched for would be the one where the pair produced susy particles decay fully hadronically via the @xmath1 baryonic rpv operator .",
    "some of the recent atlas and cms analyses however explicitly target such models and if the gluinos decay into three or five quarks , the six and seven jet analyses @xcite exclude the gluinos lighter than 900  gev .    in this paper",
    "we point out that the rpv scenario with extra matters may lead to event topologies where the gluino mass limit is more relaxed .",
    "the extra matter scenario is one of the interesting possibilities of the mssm extensions .",
    "an advantage is that anomaly of discrete r - symmetry , @xmath2 @xmath3 , in the mssm can be cancelled by the extra matter fields .",
    "for instance , it is known @xcite that introduction of a @xmath4 or a @xmath5 chiral multiplet pair , or three pairs of @xmath4 can achieve non - anomalous discrete r - symmetry .",
    "the discrete r - symmetry may play an important role in low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) models .",
    "it controls dangerous proton decay operators as well as the constant term and supersymmetric @xmath6 term in the superpotential .",
    "the mass terms of extra matter states are also controlled by the discrete r - symmetry .",
    "for example , the mass terms with the similar scale to the soft susy breaking scale can be generated by the giudice - masiero mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if several extra matter states involve in the gluino decay chain , the number of final state particles becomes large and @xmath0 of each visible particle tends to be small because the initial gluino mass energy is divided into a large number of decay products .",
    "the sensitivity of the current rpv susy searches then drops because of the high @xmath0 jet requirement .",
    "the sensitivity of the existing analyses to the hadronically decaying gluinos with long cascade decay chains has been studied in ref .",
    "the authors pointed out that the cms black hole search  @xcite can effectively constrain the light gluinos in this scenario .",
    "we will demonstrate that the limit from the cms black hole search can also be relaxed if there is a mild mass degeneracy between the gluino and the lsp .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : the next section describes our model setup that includes extra matters and some rpv operators . in section [ sec : gluino - chain ] , we discuss the gluino decay chains in the rpv extra matter scenario . in section [ sec : constraints ]",
    ", we reinterpret the existing analyses and study the gluino mass bound in the context of simplified models . section [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] are devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "we consider models with extra @xmath4 chiral multiplet pairs . we write @xmath7 and @xmath8 and introduce the mass terms for these component fields . , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the chiral multiplets containing anti - particles . ]",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 for @xmath13 . in order to have multi - step hadronic gluino decays we introduce the rpv operators @xmath14 the first term is necessary to have the lsp decay into three light flavour quarks , whilst the second term is needed to make the gluinos decay to @xmath15 as well as to make @xmath15 decay to a lighter @xmath16 ( @xmath13 ) or a neutralino lighter than @xmath15 as we will see in the next section . here and throughout the paper , @xmath15 and @xmath17 represent the superfields and/or fermionic components of the chiral multiplets and assume that the scalar components acquire the soft masses and are heavy enough not to contribute to our analysis .",
    "we assume @xmath18 is heavier than the gluino for simplicity and do not consider @xmath18 production . if @xmath18 is light enough to be copiously produced at the 8  tev lhc or appear in gluino decay chains , the rpv operators such as @xmath19 would be required .",
    "although the baryon number is violated by the @xmath1 operator in our model , the lepton number is still conserved by declaring @xmath20 fields have zero lepton number . the proton decay constraint is thus avoided . to satisfy the constraint from @xmath21-@xmath22 oscillation and suppress the single squark production we assume @xmath23 .",
    "in the models where the gluino is the lsp and the @xmath1 operator is introduced , gluinos decay into three quarks : @xmath24 .",
    "if there is a neutralino below the gluino , the gluino can decay into five quarks through the neutralino : @xmath25 .",
    "for both cases , gluinos are severely constrained by the six and seven jet analyses @xcite and the limit on the gluino mass is found at 900  gev .",
    "if the fermionic component of @xmath27 is lighter than the gluino , the gluinos can decay into two quarks and @xmath28 via off - shell squarks through the @xmath29 operator with the @xmath30 coupling .",
    "the @xmath28 can then decay into two quarks and a neutralino by the same mechanism as the gluino decay , @xmath31 , if the neutralino is lighter than @xmath28 .",
    "the neutralinos finally decay into three quarks through the @xmath1 operator . in this case",
    "the gluinos decay into seven quarks , @xmath32 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_diag1 ] . note that @xmath33 is also kinematically allowed .",
    "however , @xmath34 is roughly , up to the phase space factor , proportional to @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the electroweak gauge coupling if the neutralino is gaugino - like . we therefore take @xmath37 to suppress the @xmath33 mode .",

    "fig : decay_diag2 ]    as we have seen in this section , the rpv models with extra matters may lead to multi - step gluino decays producing a large number of quarks and no missing energy in the final state . in the next section ,",
    "we reinterpret the existing analyses and study the gluino mass limit in the event topologies considered in this section .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in the scenario where several extra matter states involve in the gluino decay chain and the lsp decays hadronically , the gluino may decay into fully hadronic final states without producing large missing energy .",
    "the event topology with such gluino decay chains is challenging to be searched for at the lhc because of the following reasons : ( 1 ) the standard susy searches requiring large @xmath40 are not sensitive to this topology .",
    "( 2 ) the final state does not contain isolated leptons , which makes it difficult to distinguish the signal from the backgrounds with fully hadronic final states ( @xmath41 qcd and fully hadronic @xmath42 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the gluino mass energy is divided into a large number of final state quarks , making each signal jet soft , which leads to degradation of signal efficiencies because of a high @xmath0 cut threshold for the signal jets .",
    "the sensitivity of the existing analyses to the models with hadronically decaying gluinos via the baryonic rpv operator has been studied in ref .",
    "the authors pointed out that the most stringent constraints were obtained by the atlas 6 - 7 high @xmath0 jet search @xcite and the cms black hole search @xcite .",
    "the atlas 6 - 7 high @xmath0 jet search looks for excesses in the 6 and 7 exclusive jet multiplicity bins with various @xmath0 cuts : @xmath43 , 100 , 120 , 140 and 180  gev .",
    "the cms black hole search , on the other hand , employs somewhat smaller @xmath0 cut threshold , 50  gev .",
    "the analysis uses a kinematic variable , @xmath44 , which is defined as the scalar sum of all reconstructed objects , including @xmath40 , with @xmath45  gev . ref .",
    "@xcite found that signal events may pollute the control region in the cms black hole search and proposed a prescription which assumes the observed data is potentially entirely from signal , with zero background .",
    "this prescription provides conservative limits and we closely follow their analyses .",
    "in particular we use the signal regions ( @xmath46 and 2.2  tev and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of reconstructed objects , excluding @xmath40 , with @xmath45  gev ) and the corresponding visible cross section upper limits used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to estimate the gluino mass bound , we simulate events using herwig++ @xcite",
    ". generated event samples are then passed to delphes @xcite to simulate detector responses , before estimating signal efficiencies for the signal regions .",
    "for the cross section of gluino pair production , we use the values reported by the lhc susy cross section working group @xcite , which includes nlo susy qcd corrections and the resummation of soft gluon emission at nll accuracy .        to make complicated gluino decay chains tractable , we study the gluino mass limit following simplified model approach . in our analysis",
    ", we assume squarks are decoupled in the gluino decay and production process , and the gluino decay chain is generalised as a cascade decay through @xmath21 intermediate bsm states , @xmath49 , with each decay , except for @xmath50 , producing two light flavour quarks , @xmath51 , and @xmath50 finally decays into three quarks via the @xmath1 operator , @xmath52 . in this setup the gluinos decay into @xmath53 light flavour quarks . in the extra matter scenarios ,",

    "as can be seen , the constraints obtained from the atlas high @xmath0 jet search become weaker as the mass gap @xmath55 increases up to @xmath64  gev .",
    "this is expected because the @xmath0 scale of the jets coming from @xmath50 decay is characterised by @xmath65 .",
    "contrary , the sensitivity of the cms black hole search increases as @xmath55 increases .",
    "this is because the search is sensitive to the events with large jet multiplicity , and the jets coming from the gluino and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) states become hard enough to pass the @xmath0 cut in this analysis when @xmath55 increases . because of the above two effects , a window of the allowed region opens for the 900 gev gluino at some value of @xmath55 . for the @xmath58 model",
    ", this window appears in the @xmath68 region . for the @xmath69 model , these effects are more dramatic compared to the @xmath58 case .",
    "namely , the atlas constrains become weaker and the cms constraints glows stronger more quickly when increasing @xmath55 compared to the @xmath58 case .",
    "consequently , the allowed window for the @xmath69 model appears in the more degenerate mass region : @xmath70    in fig .",
    "[ fig : glimit ] we show the ratio of the gluino cross section and its 95 % cl upper limit as a function of the gluino mass . here",
    "we scan @xmath55 for each gluino mass and choose the value which gives the weakest sensitivity for that gluino mass .",
    "we see that the gluino mass limit can be relaxed up to about 810 ( @xmath71 )  gev for the @xmath58 ( 4 ) model .",
    "in the previous section , we found that in the @xmath72 model the atlas 6 - 7 jet analysis excludes a 900  gev gluino only for the @xmath73  gev region , whilst the cms black hole analysis does so only for the @xmath74  gev region .",
    "consequently a gap in sensitivity arises at the @xmath75 region for the 900  gev gluino in the @xmath76(4 ) model .",
    "one can expect that this gap can be filled by introducing new signal regions which covers the intermediate region between the atlas 6 - 7 jet analysis and the cms black hole analysis .",
    "such new signal regions are shown as the green region in fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy - table ] , where we summarise the current situation of the analyses by a schematic coverage table .",
    "we would like to comment on the @xmath77 limit . in this limit",
    "the gluino mass energy is divided into a very large number of quarks and @xmath0 of each jet would become very small .",
    "most of the quark jets would fail to pass the 50  gev jet @xmath0 cut and the analyses with such a @xmath0 cut would not be effective to constrain the model . to search for @xmath77 scenarios , one would need to extend the search region in the space of the jet @xmath0 cut threshold and the jet multiplicity bin , as shown in the grey region in fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy - table ] . in this region",
    "one has to look at either a very small jet @xmath0 bin or a very large jet multiplicity bin .",
    "it is however challenging to accurately estimate the background contribution to such soft or large jet multiplicity bins .",
    "we also comment on the cms gluino resonance search @xcite .",
    "this analysis looks for a bump in the three jet invariant mass distribution assuming @xmath78 topology using @xmath79 fb@xmath80 of @xmath81 collision data at @xmath82 tev .",
    "although this is another constraint , we do not expect this analysis changes our result drastically . in the @xmath58 and 4 models ,",
    "gluinos decay into 7 and 11 quarks and three quark invariant mass does not reconstruct the gluino mass .",
    "moreover , because of the large jet multiplicity , the combinatorial background is much larger in the @xmath58 and 4 models , which would degrade the sensitivity of the analysis significantly .",
    "the multi - step gluino decay chains can also be realised with the @xmath18 intermediate states . in this case",
    "the gluino mass bound would become stronger since @xmath18 production events would also contribute to the signal region . however , in the small @xmath55 region , the production cross section of @xmath18 is smaller than that for the gluinos due to its smaller colour factor .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath18 production events is also smaller since @xmath18 decays fewer quarks compared to the gluinos .",
    "we therefore expect that the gluino mass bound would not change drastically in the models with the @xmath18 intermediate states .",
    "if @xmath28 are also included in this system with @xmath83 , the gluino decay chain would become longer and it may be helpful to relax the gluino mass bound",
    ".    we also comment on the models with a @xmath84 pair , where @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ) .",
    "the multi - step gluino decay chains via the @xmath87 intermediate states are possible in this model using the @xmath88 operator .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that in our scenario the mass bound on the extra matters are also relaxed since the extra matter states decay fully hadronically through long cascade decay chains .",
    "in this paper we pointed out that the rpv models with extra matters may lead to multi - step gluino decays into fully hadronic final states .",
    "we reinterpreted the existing analyses and studied the gluino mass bound in our generalised model . in the region where the mass gap @xmath55 is small ,",
    "the sensitivity of atlas 6 - 7 jets analysis decreases , whilst that of cms black hole search increases as increasing @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the current lhc sensitivity is minimised at some value of @xmath55 . in the simulation we demonstrated that the gluino mass bound in such scenarios can be as small as @xmath89 or @xmath90  gev depending on the number of intermediate states in the gluino decay chain .    in order to increase the sensitivity to the gluinos that undergo multi - step cascade decays into fully hadronic final states , it is important to extend the search strategy in the space of the jet @xmath0 cut threshold and the jet multiplicity bin , which requires a better understanding of the backgrounds contributing the soft and large jet multiplicity bins .      m.a .",
