    "diffraction exchange is the study of vacuum exchange at high energies .",
    "it is frequently divided into elastic , singly - dissociative and double dissociative processes as illustrated in figure [ fig : had_dif ] , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be photons or hadrons and @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be single particles or an inclusive sum over @xmath4 particle states .",
    "the    wiggly line indicates an exchange of energy and momentum , but no non - zero colour or flavour quantum numbers may be exchanged .",
    "high energy means that the square of the centre of mass energy @xmath5 is much larger than any other energy scale : @xmath6 for diffractive processes initiated by virtual photons , the latter include the virtuality @xmath7 , implying @xmath8 we note that @xmath9 can themselves become large , provided they remain much smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "experimentally , diffractive processes are characterized by two distinctive features : * rising cross - sections * and * rapidity gaps*. the two groups of final state particles in figure [ fig : had_dif ] emerge in roughly the forward and backward directions in the centre of mass frame ; and are well - separated in rapidity or pseudo - rapidity @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the polar angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "such rapidity gaps are characteristic of colour singlet exchange , in contrast to the hadronization strings associated with colour exchange .",
    "they occur not only in diffractive processes , but in , for example , colour singlet meson exchange processes .",
    "however meson exchange gives rise to cross - sections which fall rapidly with increasing energy , in contrast to diffractive processes which have constant or rising cross - sections .",
    "nonetheless at finite energies one may need to take account of small contributions from the exchange of flavour singlet meson exchange contributions , which can in general interfere with the dominant diffractive process .",
    "diffractive processes , so defined , are copious and varied .",
    "for example the singly dissociative inclusive reaction @xmath13 where @xmath2 is an inclusive sum over hadronic states , accounts for 10 - 20 @xmath14 of the @xmath15 total cross - sections at low @xmath16 .",
    "( here and throughout , @xmath17 indicates either a real or virtual photon , while @xmath18 refers exclusively to real photons . )",
    "this reaction has stimulated an enormous literature already@xcite and new data will be presented here@xcite . of particular interest is the behaviour for @xmath19 , which explores aspects of diffraction which are not easily studied in other processes .",
    "exclusive processes discussed at the conference include : elastic virtual compton scattering @xmath20 which is not measured directly , but is related to the @xmath15 total cross - sections and hence the deep inelastic structure functions via the optical theorem ; deeply virtual compton scattering(dvcs ) @xmath21 for which the first data are presented at this conference@xcite ; and the vector meson production processes@xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 where measuring the vector meson decay products the enables the spin structure of the interaction and the separate contributions from longtitudinal and transverse photons to be studied .",
    "in addition , the @xmath24 mass introduces an at least moderately large scale into the problem even for real photons .",
    "perturbative aspects of diffraction can also be enhanced by working at high t@xcite and/or by the study of diffractive jet production@xcite .",
    "finally some of the first results on diffraction in @xmath25 collisions are also reported@xcite .",
    "diffraction involves an interplay of perturbative and non - perturbative effects which presently defies a rigorous treatment in qcd .",
    "rather there are innumerable models which throw light on different aspects of the problem with varying degrees of success . here",
    "we try to provide a simple framework which can be used to classify and compare the various models and hopefully avoid confusion . to do this",
    "we emphasize two features .",
    "the first thing to consider is the way the model implements vacuum exchange .",
    "there are three main approaches , which we will list for the moment and illustrate later .    *",
    "* regge models * , in which the vacuum exchange is usually described by the exchange of one or more regge poles with vacuum quantum numbers , called pomerons .",
    "* * gluon exchange models * in which the vacuum exchange is modelled by the exchange of two or more gluons in a colour singlet state . * * quasi - optical models * in which the projectile is regarded as a superposition of `` scattering eigenstates '' which are either absorbed or scatter unchanged at fixed impact parameter on traversing the `` target . ''",
    "different reference frames are conveniently chosen to emphasize different aspects of the physics and caution is required in comparing dynamical models formulated in different frames .",
    "popular choices for discussing @xmath15 collisions include :    * the * infinite momentum frame * in which , for large @xmath7 at least , the parton distribution functions(pdfs ) have a simple interpretation and the photon is regarded as pointlike . *",
    "the * laboratory frame * in which the incoming photon is typically absorbed a long distance , of order @xmath26 from the proton target and the intermediate states into which it converts are usually regarded as constituents of the photon .",
    "the study of diffraction has been transformed by the discovery of hard diffraction in @xmath27 collisions at hera . here",
    "we summarize this discovery and some of the questions it raises .      before discussing diffractive photoprocesses , it is useful to comment on the `` soft diffraction '' observed in purely hadronic processes . at high energies",
    "@xmath28 , hadronic scattering is well - described by regge pole exchange , as illustrated in figure [ fig : regge ] for the charge exchange reaction    @xmath29 .",
    "if a single pole @xmath30 dominates , the differential cross - section for any 2 @xmath31 2 reaction satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a convenient scale , usually taken to be 1 gev@xmath34 , and the _ regge trajectories _",
    "@xmath35 are found to be approximately linear .",
    "they relate the observed energy dependence in the scattering region @xmath36 to the exchanged mesons at @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the spin and mass of the meson respectively .",
    "the picture applies to baryon as well as meson exchange , with an approximately universal _",
    "slope parameter _",
    "@xmath39 gev@xmath34 .",
    "in contrast the _ intercept _",
    "@xmath40 depends on the flavour exchange quantum numbers @xmath30 , with @xmath41 for the leading non - strange meson trajectories , leading to cross - sections ( [ dcs ] ) which fall roughly like @xmath42 .",
    "the above picture accounts remarkably well for reactions with non - zero flavour exchange , including other features - shrinkage , factorisation , dips - not mentioned here .",
    "it can be extended successfully to vacuum exchange processes by adding a single additional regge pole to describe diffraction , called the pomeron .",
    "specifically the available data on a wide range of different reactions is consistent with the same universal trajectory@xcite @xmath43 where the high value of the intercept @xmath44 reflects the fact that diffractive cross - sections rise slowly with energy .",
    "in addition , the pomeron slope @xmath45 gev@xmath34 differs markedly from the approximately universal slope @xmath46 observed for all @xmath47 meson and @xmath48 baryon regge poles , suggesting the pomeron is not associated with @xmath47 meson exchange .",
    "it is rather assumed to be associated with the exchange of gluons , so that particles lying on the pomeron trajectory are presumably glueballs .",
    "the lightest glueball on the trajectory ( [ sptraj ] ) is a @xmath49 particle with a predicted mass of around 1.9 gev .",
    "this is not unreasonable , although it must be said that little is known from experiment about the glueball spectrum and the situation may well be more complicated .    finally ,",
    "before leaving hadronic diffraction , we highlight two points about regge theory whose importance can not be overemphasized :    * the trajectory function ( [ trajectory ] ) for any given regge pole depends only on @xmath50 and is independent of the energy range and the reaction considered ; and * the exchange of two or more regge poles leads to more complicated terms - _ regge cuts _ - which are neglected in most applications , but which must be present at some level of accuracy .      the above picture of soft pomeron exchange works quite well for some real photoprocesses like the total photoabsorption cross - section @xmath51 or @xmath52 or @xmath53 photoproduction . however a steeper rise with energy is observed if s is very large ( or @xmath16 is very small ) and an at least moderately hard scale enters the process . more generally , if different data sets are parameterized by a single regge pole exchange formula , the intercept is found to vary roughly in the range @xmath54    ( 8.0,5.5 )    ( 8.0,6.0 )    the particular value obtained depends on the reaction and on the ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath16 ( or equivalently @xmath10 ) considered .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : sfdata ] , which shows the total cross - section @xmath55 as a function of @xmath10 at various fixed @xmath7 , where the increase in @xmath56 at high @xmath7 and high @xmath10 , corresponding to low @xmath16 , is clearly seen .",
    "it follows from the above that diffractive photoprocesses can not be described by a single regge pole exchange , since this requires a universal energy dependence in all cases .",
    "the obvious interpretation is that there is a new phenomenon - `` hard diffraction '' - which becomes dominant for hard enough scales and large enough energies .",
    "if one assumes that this can also be approximated by a regge pole one is led to the hypothesis of two pomerons : the soft pomeron ( [ sptraj ] ) which dominates in hadronic diffraction and some `` soft '' photoprocesses ; and a second `` hard pomeron '' which dominates for hard enough scales and large enough energies .",
    "this hypothesis has been explored by donnachie and landshoff@xcite who obtain an excellent fit to data on the proton structure function , the charmed structure function and on @xmath57 production ( [ jpsi ] ) for a hard pomeron trajectory @xmath58 the varying energy dependence arises from the varying relative importance of the two contributions , which is illustrated in figure [ fig : f2rel ] for the proton structure function .",
    "alternatively , gotsman will discuss@xcite a two component model in which the `` hard component '' is described by a model based on perturbative qcd . in both cases , between the regions of soft and hard diffraction at @xmath59 and high @xmath7",
    "respectively , there is an extensive transition region in which both can be important .",
    "the discovery of hard diffraction at hera opens up the subject to perturbative methods in qcd .",
    "these can be based on resummations of the perturbative expansion retaining leading terms in @xmath60 ( dglap ) or leading terms in @xmath61 ( bfkl ) , since both these quantities become large in the relevant kinematic region .",
    "the former is the most familiar and has it s best known application in the dglap evolution of the structure functions .",
    "in particular , it has long been known@xcite that this can generate an increasingly steep low-@xmath16 behaviour as @xmath7 increases , and a good fit to the data can be obtained for @xmath62 gev@xmath63 with the gluon distributions @xmath64 shown in figure [ fig : gluons ] @xcite .",
    "the gluon densities at @xmath65 gev@xmath63 are unstable , implying that the dglap picture can not be trusted at such low @xmath7 values , but the success at higher @xmath7 values is impressive .",
    "this `` dglap picture , '' based on the dominance of gluon ladder exchanges(see e.g. the talk of gotsman@xcite ) , can be extended to other diffractive processes at high @xmath7 , especially for those processes where , in lowest order at least , one can prove factorisation into terms describing the fluctuation of the initial photon into @xmath66 pairs ; the formation of the final particle from the said pairs ; and the interaction of the @xmath66 with the proton @xcite .",
    "however the gluon distributions required are `` skewed '' parton distributions@xcite , which take into account the fact that the incoming and outgoing protons in inelastic processes like ( [ ddis ] , [ dvcs ] , [ rho ] , [ jpsi ] ) have different momenta , even in the forward direction .",
    "the empirical study of skewed parton corrections has only just begun@xcite @xcite .",
    "a potential problem with leading , next leading .. @xmath67 approximations is that as @xmath68 , neglected terms might become important because although they are lower order in @xmath67 , they are leading order in @xmath69 .",
    "thus one might expect to see a breakdown of dglap at very small-@xmath16 - but how small ?",
    "this gives rise to the alternative bfkl approach of leading @xmath69 resummation . in leading order",
    "this approach predicted the hard pomeron intercept with apparent success , but it runs into serious difficulties beyond leading order .",
    "this topic will be discussed by ross@xcite while a succinct comparison of the regge , bfkl and dglap approaches and their relation to each other may be found in the recent review of ball and landshoff@xcite .    in the rest of this talk",
    "we will concentrate on two more phenomenological questions :    * can we find a unified description of both hard and soft diffraction and of the wide variety of diffractive processes ?",
    "* when can we expect to see so - called `` gluon saturation '' effects at small @xmath16 ?    these are conveniently addressed in the context of the _ colour dipole model _ , to which we immediately turn .",
    "singly dissociative diffractive @xmath18 p processes are conveniently described in the rest frame of the hadron using a picture in which the incoming photon intially dissociates into a @xmath66 pair a long distance - typically of order of the `` coherence length '' @xmath70 - from the target proton .",
    "assuming that the resulting partonic / hadronic state evolves slowly compared to the size of the proton or nuclear target , it can be regarded as frozen during the interaction . in this approximation",
    ", the process will factorize into a probability for the photon to have evolved into a given state @xmath71 , times the amplitude for that state to interact with the target . in the colour dipole model ,  @xcite",
    "the dominant states @xmath71 are assumed to be @xmath66 states of given transverse size .",
    "specifically @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the transverse size of the pair , @xmath74 is the fraction of light cone energy carried by the quark and @xmath75 is the _ light cone wave function _ of the photon .",
    "assuming that these states are scattering eigenstates ( i.e. that @xmath76 remain unchanged in diffractive scattering ) the elastic scattering amplitude for @xmath77 is specified by figure [ fig : fluct ] .",
    "this leads via the optical theorem to @xmath78 for the @xmath15 total cross - section in deep inelastic scattering , where @xmath79 is the total cross - section for scattering dipoles of specified @xmath80 from a proton at fixed @xmath81 .",
    "this `` dipole cross - section '' is a universal quantity for singly - dissociative diffractive processes on a proton target , playing a similarly fundamental role in , for example , open diffraction ( [ ddis ] ) , exclusive vector meson production ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ jpsi ] ) and deeply virtual compton scattering ( [ dvcs ] ) .    the dipole cross - section has been evaluated by several groups@xcite . although the assumptions made to do this vary , there are some features in common .",
    "the dipole cross - section at a given energy is assumed to be approximately `` geometrical '' , i.e. to depend on the transverse size @xmath73 of the dipole , but not to depend on @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , approximate qcd behaviour(colour transparency ) for small dipoles @xmath82 and `` hadronic behaviour ''    for large dipoles @xmath83fm are incorporated in varying degrees of detailfm make a negligible contribution , since the wavefunction factor in ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) decreases exponentially at large @xmath73 . ] . a useful summary and comparison of the various approaches",
    "may be found in the recent review of mcdermott@xcite . from now on i shall present results from forshaw , kerley and shaw@xcite , @xcite - @xcite who have extracted the dipole cross - section from dis and real photoabsorption data assuming a form with two terms with a regge type @xmath10 dependence : @xmath84 where the values @xmath85 , @xmath86 resulting from the fit are characteristic of the soft and hard pomeron respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 are chosen so that for small dipoles the hard term dominates yielding a behaviour @xmath89 as @xmath82 in accordance with colour transparency ideas ; while for large dipoles @xmath83 fm the soft term dominates with a hadronlike behaviour @xmath90 .",
    "correspondingly the photon wavefunction is assumed to be perturbative for small dipoles , with a simple ansatz for confinement effects at large @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting dipole cross - section , determined from dis and real photoabsorption data , is shown in figure [ fig : dcs ] for various energies in the hera region .      * the charmed structure function@xcite by retaining only the charmed quark loop in figure [ fig : fluct ] ; * open diffraction ( [ ddis ] ) from figure [ fig : ddis ] , together with an additional contribution from intermediate @xmath91 states which is important for large diffractive masses @xmath92 , but small elsewhere @xcite . * virtual compton scattering ( [ dvcs ] ) , by replacing the final state photon in figure [ fig : fluct ] by a real photon @xcite .",
    "the dipole model is particularly useful for discussing saturation effects , since it incorporates both soft and hard diffraction , associated with small and large dipoles respectively .",
    "there are actually two types of saturation effect , which are quite distinct and should not be confused .",
    "* low @xmath7 saturation .",
    "* as can be seen in figure [ fig : dcs ] , the dipole cross - section increases rapidly as a function of the dipole size @xmath73 at small @xmath73 , but then `` saturates '' to a slowly varying cross - section of hadronic size at larger @xmath73 values . this change - and the fact that it shifts to smaller @xmath73 as @xmath10 increases -is crucial to describe the form of the change from approximate scaling to the observed @xmath93 ( and hence @xmath68 ) behaviour at fixed @xmath10 . to see this we note that the @xmath7 dependence in ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) arises entirely from the wavefunction . as @xmath7 decreases , larger @xmath73 values are explored and the slowly varying dipole cross - section results in a weakening @xmath7 dependence for @xmath94 . when @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the constituent quark mass , the wavefunction and @xmath94 become independent of @xmath7 so that @xmath97 as @xmath93 as required .",
    "* gluon saturation .",
    "* for high enough energies , the assumed @xmath98 behaviours assumed above must be tamed by unitarity effects , especially for the hard term with @xmath99 . at fixed @xmath7 , @xmath68 as @xmath100 and the resulting softening of the corresponding @xmath101 behaviour",
    "is associated with gluon saturation in the quark - parton language .",
    "gluon saturation can be incorporated into dipole and other closely related models by hand @xcite or using the eikonal approximation @xcite but are not included in ( [ gammatot ] ) .",
    "hence the fact that an excellent fit is obtained to the dis data using ( [ gammatot ] ) means that the current hera data are not at sufficiently high @xmath10 to _ require _ the saturation effects that are built into some other dipole models  @xcite .",
    "we note that our model agrees with the standard caldwell plot figure [ fig : caldwell ] , where the turn over as @xmath16 decreases occurs because @xmath7 is also decreasing and is understood as a low @xmath7 saturation effect .",
    "no such effect is predicted in our model if @xmath16 is decreased at fixed @xmath7 , as confirmed by the preliminary zeus97 data .    a strong indication of when saturation effects will be needed is given in figure [ fig : dcs ] .",
    "as can be seen , the cross - section for small dipoles is initially small but increases rapidly and at the top of the accessable hera range is becoming commensurate with the slowly increasing `` hadronic '' behaviour af the large dipoles .",
    "it is at this point that saturation effects are expected to become important ; if they do nt , the cross - section for small dipoles will exceed that for large dipoles at higher energies and the dipole cross - section will paradoxically decrease with increasing size @xmath73 .",
    "saturation effects are therefore expected to play an important role just beyond beyond the hera range , in the planned thera region with @xmath102 gev@xmath63 .",
