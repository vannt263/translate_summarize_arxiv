    "intercomparisons of data within a changing experimental landscape is challenging .",
    "it is conventional to compare various aspects of jet production with several qcd monte carlos ( mcs )  @xcite including multiple mechanisms and parameters also evolving with time .",
    "whether a given mc describes some data or not and to what extent , we can ask whether the basic jet data are actually sufficiently structured to test complex qcd mc models .    as an alternative approach a universal jet production parametrization based on a few simple principles",
    "might be developed that describes most jet - production data accurately .",
    "the parametrization could then be used as a reference system for comparisons among data sets and data / model comparisons .",
    "such a parametrization should be efficient ( few parameters ) , easy to generate ( algebraically simple ) , universal ( describing at least a substantial fraction of the jet - related data volume accurately ) and directly related to basic qcd principles .",
    "in addition to event - wise reconstruction of single jets jet production includes manifestations in hadron single - particle spectra and multiparticle correlations .",
    "we can therefore establish a further goal : any model or parametrization of jet production should be consistent with spectrum and correlation manifestations or be rejected . to establish a simple quantitative connection between jet production and the hadronic final state we combine a parametrization of scattered - parton fragmentation functions in  collisions with a parametrization of parton ( jet ) spectra from  collisions to describe quantitative aspects of hadron spectra .",
    "in this study we follow a strategy previously applied to the parametrization of parton fragmentation functions based on rapidities .",
    "we transform measured jet momentum spectra to a rapidity variable @xmath1 relative to an offset ( jet cutoff energy ) and rescale both the cross sections and jet rapidities according to the beam rapidity .",
    "after transformation the jet data fall on a single gaussian locus that forms the basis for the parametrization .",
    "the jet spectrum parametrization from this study is combined with a fragmentation function parametrization to predict the minimum - bias jet contribution to hadron spectra ( spectrum hard component ) .",
    "quantitative correspondence with data lends support to the jet production parametrization .",
    "the success of the jet - production model for  collision energies below 1 tev and systematic deviations from the model at higher beam energies suggest that the eikonal model as a basis for jet production monte carlos is questionable at lower energies but may be applicable for higher jet and collision energies .",

    "in high energy nuclear collisions experimental evidence  @xcite and theoretical arguments  @xcite indicate that most jets are produced at low energies ( near 3 gev ) , and low - energy jets make substantial contributions to hadron production , especially in more - central   collisions .",
    "full understanding of nuclear collisions then depends on an accurate description of jet - related hadron production .",
    "but theoretical descriptions of low - energy jet production and fragmentation to hadrons are still incomplete . as an alternative we can attempt to develop a simple phenomenological model to serve as an interface between experiment and theory .    in this study",
    "we establish a self - consistent parametrized jet spectrum model for low - energy jets / partons from jet production data .",

    "parton fragmentation to hadron jets and projectile - nucleon fragmentation ( dissociation ) to soft hadrons are similar processes .",
    "when measured ffs are plotted on fragment rapidity for different parton energies the result is a self - similar ensemble .",
    "the ff ensemble can be rescaled logarithmically both horizontally and vertically to bring all ff data onto a single locus , modulo small variations in the model - function parameters over a large jet energy interval  @xcite .",
    "the result is a remarkable compression of ff data revealing that very few underlying degrees of freedom are actually accessible to or require theoretical description .",
    "the simple two - parameter ff model is accurate at the percent level and facilitates theoretical calculations of jet fragment production  @xcite .",
    "we then argue by analogy that projectile nucleon fragmentation to soft hadrons should also follow a self - similar logarithmic dependence on projectile energy .",
    "we assume only that small - x partons released by projectile dissociation in p - p collisions follow a longitudinal distribution approximately flat near mid - rapidity and falling to zero near the beam rapidity . as with ff scaling",
    ", changes in projectile energy should result in distributions with fixed shape scaling logarithmically both vertically and horizontally . according to the principle of local parton - hadron duality",
    "@xcite the final - state soft - hadron distribution should closely follow the small-@xmath5 parton distribution .",
    "we then require two more elements for the jet production model : ( a ) the systematics of minimum - bias ( mb ) dijet production from small-@xmath5 partons in  collisions and ( b ) an empirical form of the jet spectrum on parton rapidity that will serve as the scalable jet spectrum shape .",

    "we then combine the jet spectrum model with ffs derived from  collisions to predict the jet fragment contribution to  hadron spectra and compare model predictions to data .",
