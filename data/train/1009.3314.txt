    "the phase transitions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , for example the evolution between chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration , the color ( or simply quark ) confinement and deconfinement , have been the most active topics in nuclear and particle physics in recent years  @xcite . even though recent investigation has provided hints that the phase transitions can be driven by the intrinsic characteristics , such as the running coupling strength and the current quark mass , of the system ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the more promising and much better believed is that the qcd may undergo phase transitions into a chirally symmetric and color deconfined phase at high temperature and/or density  @xcite .    to demonstrate the phase transitions ,",
    "one usually implements the variation behaviors of not only the features of qcd vacuum and the strong interaction matter but also the properties of hadrons at finite temperature and/or density . on theoretical side",
    ", one needs in principle qcd , which has been widely accepted as the fundamental theory of strong interaction , to carry out the investigation .",
    "however , as a basic theory , qcd still suffers from difficulties in the low energy region , which relates directly to strong interaction matter and hadrons .",
    "then , besides the approaches of lattice simulations , qcd sum rules , instanton model(s ) and dyson - schwinger equations and several models , such as the bag model  @xcite , quark - meson coupling model ( qmc )  @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , polyakov - loop improved njl model  @xcite , global color symmetry model ( gcm )  @xcite , and so on , have been developed .",
    "the njl model has been widely used since it preserves the feature of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking and is easy to carry out numerical calculation . even though , with the polyakov - loop improvement , the quark confinement effect is included at statistical level , the commonly accepted one still only takes into account the point ( contact ) interactions among quarks .",
    "the bag model is the one which handles hadrons as bubbles of perturbative vacuum immersed in the physical vacuum .",
    "however , all nonperturbative physics is included in a quantity  bag constant , which is dealt with a phenomenological parameter in the model . and",
    "the qmc model involves the similar problem . for the gcm ,",
    "since it can take the result of the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse )  @xcite approach as input , it manifests well the properties of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking . because the bag constant in the model is taken as the difference between the energy densities of the perturbative and the physical vacuums , the color confinement effect is also handled well in some sense .",
    "the gcm is then believed to be a quite sophisticated model which involves as many characteristics of qcd as possible . and",
    "the njl model , the qmc model , and the bag model can be treated as the special cases of the gcm .",
    "due to its solid qcd foundation , the gcm has been widely taken to study not only the properties of nucleon and some mesons  @xcite but also the qcd vacuum structure  @xcite .",
    "it has also been extended to investigate the properties of strong interaction matter at finite temperature and/or density and those of some hadrons in the matter  @xcite . for the property of nucleon in finite density matter",
    ", it has been discussed with various models for the effective gluon propagator in the dse and the variation behaviors of the mass , the radius and the bag constant of the nucleon have been given explicitly  @xcite . however , in the case of finite temperature , only the changing feature of the bag constant has been discussed with the munczek - nemirovsky model  @xcite for the effective gluon propagator of the dse  @xcite . we will then , in this paper , discuss some of the properties of a nucleon at finite temperature with a sophisticated effective gluon propagator in the dse .",

    "of course , there are various aspects to be improved .",
    "for example , we take the commonly used effective gluon propagator , which is independent of temperature , to solve the quark dse and make use of the preliminary gcm soliton model  @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to implement the real gcm soliton model  @xcite with solving at first the coupled dses of the quark , gluon and ghost , and then the coupled equations of the quark and the chiral fields , with the inclusion of the temperature effect . in more detail , for the quark gluon interaction vertex , we take simply the bare vertex @xmath160 in our present work , in fact more realistic vertex functions , such as the bc vertex  @xcite , which has been shown to be able to improve the calculation of meson properties greatly  @xcite , even the bc vertex together with the transverse part being included simultaneously  @xcite , should be implemented to make the calculation with much more solid qcd foundation .",
    "it is also necessary to notice the dimensionless quantity @xmath55 which takes account of the contributions of the zero - point effect , the color - electronic and color - magnetic interactions , the motion of center - of - mass and all the others . in our present work ,",
    "we handle it , in the commonly taken way , as a free parameter to be fixed by the property of a nucleon in free space .",
    "in fact , all the aspects of the @xmath55 are quite complicated and have recently been paid great attentions ( see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite tried to evaluate the zero - point effect part from the gluon field fluctuations directly ) . furthermore , extending the result of the thermal casimir effect in ideal metal rectangular boxes  @xcite , we infer that the @xmath55 ( at least , the zero - point effect part ) may depend on temperature .",
    "it would then be interesting to study the temperature dependence of the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the related investigations are in progress .",

    "<S> we study the temperature dependence of the effective bag constant , the mass , and the radius of a nucleon in the formalism of the simple global color symmetry model in the dyson - schwinger equation approach of qcd with a gaussian - type effective gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that , as the temperature is lower than a critical value , the effective bag constant and the mass decrease and the radius increases with the temperature increasing . </S>",
    "<S> as the critical temperature is reached , the effective bag constant and the mass vanish and the radius tends to infinity . at the same time , the chiral quark condensate disappears . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena indicate that the deconfinement and the chiral symmetry restoration phase transitions can take place at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the critical temperature on the interaction strength parameter in the effective gluon propagator of the approach is given .    </S>"
