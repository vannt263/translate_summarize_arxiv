    "they can be used to tabulate knots and links as in @xcite .",
    "they can be used to define and compute invariants , such as the linking number or the various polynomials associated to knots .",
    "but relatively little seems to be known about the combinatorial properties of the knot diagrams associated to knots .    given a diagram of a knot or link @xmath9",
    ", one can ignore which strand is the overstrand at each crossing and think of it as a planar 4-valent graph embedded on the 2-sphere @xmath10 .",
    "( for the purposes of this paper , links refer only to multi - component links and do not include knots . )",
    "this graph divides the sphere into @xmath7-gons , which we call faces and which meet at vertices and along edges . for our purposes , we assume that the diagrams are connected and reduced , which for the diagram means that any obviously unnecessary crossings have been eliminated , and which for the graph means that the removal of any single vertex can not separate the graph .",
    "in particular , the two endpoints of an edge can not both occur at the same vertex .",
    "one would like to understand the possibilities for the collection of complementary @xmath7-gon faces associated to the diagrams of a knot or link .",
    "to that end , we make the following definitions .",
    "given a knot or link @xmath9 and a strictly increasing sequence of integers @xmath11 with @xmath12 , we say the sequence is _ realized _ by @xmath9 if there exists a diagram for the knot or link such that each face is an @xmath13-gon for some @xmath13 that appears in the sequence .",
    "such a diagram is called an @xmath11-diagram .",
    "( not every @xmath13 must be realized by a face . )",
    "we say that a sequence is _ universal _ if every knot and link has a diagram that realizes the sequence .",
    "we sometimes restrict to sequences that are universal just for knots but not for multi - component links .",
    "this paper is an investigation into which sequences are universal for knots and/or links .",
    "this research was motivated by a fact from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.2 and figure 3 ) .",

    "* figure 3 ) . )    [ thm : two - coloring ] every knot has a projection that can be decomposed into two sub - arcs such that each sub - arc never crosses itself .        to see why the theorem holds , start with a short black arc that avoids the crossings and",
    "make the rest of the projection grey . then extend the black arc by moving one of its vertices along the knot projection , as in  [ ozawa - new ] .",
    "if we come to a crossing and it is not yet colored , extend the black through the crossing .",
    "if we come to a crossing and the other strand is already black , push this strand along ahead of the black coloring as we extend the black coloring .",
    "continue in this manner until we have a valid 2-coloring .",
    "this theorem easily implies that every knot has a projection with at most four odd - sided regions .",
    "take the projection provided by the theorem .",
    "let the two points where the knot changes color be called _",
    "transition vertices_. any face that does not contain a transition vertex on one of its edges must have an even number of edges that alternate between the two colors as we travel around the boundary of the face .",
    "a face that contains one transition vertex on an edge must have an odd number of edges .",
    "since there are two transition vertices and each can appear on an edge incident to two faces , there are at most four odd - sided faces . in theorem",
    "[ thm : twoodd ] , we improve this to show that in fact every knot has a projection with exactly two odd - sided faces .",
    "this result causes one to consider what the restrictions are on the values of @xmath7 that occur for the faces in projections of knots and links .    let us begin with some elementary observations .",
    "given a knot diagram @xmath14 , let @xmath15 be the number of faces of @xmath16 sides .",
    "note that @xmath17 .",
    "considering the previously mentioned 4-valent graph on the 2-sphere , we have :    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    by euler characteristic , we can plug this into @xmath21 to obtain :    @xmath22    in graph theory and geometry , there is a long history , dating back to @xcite , of investigations into those sequences of values that satisfy equation [ eqn : euler ] and that represent actual @xmath23-valent graphs on the sphere .",
    "however , graph theorists and geometers , who are interested in these graphs as the 1-skeletons of convex polytopes , typically assume that @xmath24 , which we will not usually want to do .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , grnbaum proved that for any collection of integers with @xmath25 = 0 that satisfies equation [ eqn : euler ] , there exists a choice of @xmath26 such that there is a planar 3-connected @xmath23-valent graph realizing these values .",
    "this theorem is known as eberhard s theorem . in @xcite , this result",
    "was extended to show that there is a value for @xmath26 so that the resulting graph is the projection of a knot , rather than a link .    for our purposes , equation",
    "[ eqn : euler ] provides several useful pieces of information .",
    "first , for any diagram of a knot or link , either @xmath25 or @xmath27 is nonzero . in other words ,",
    "any sequence that is realized by a nontrivial reduced projection must begin with a 2 or a 3 .",
    "second , the number of @xmath23-gons is not constrained by euler characteristic .",
    "third , by considering this equation mod 2 , the number of odd - sided regions must always be even .    in section 2 ,",
    "we begin by proving the result mentioned above , that every knot has a diagram with exactly two odd - sided faces .",
    "moreover , we show that the odd - sided regions can be chosen to be triangles .    putting this result in terms of what it implies in the language introduced above",
    ", the sequence @xmath28 is universal for knots .",
    "we further obtain upper bounds on the least number of odd regions that can occur in a projection of an @xmath7-component link .    in the opposite direction , we prove that the integers in a sequence realized for any knot can not have a nontrivial common divisor .",
    "for example , it can never be the case that all the faces are even - sided .",
    "this is not true for links .",
    "in fact , a 2-component link is realized in a projection with all even - sided faces if and only if both components are individually trivial .",
    "note that because every universal sequence must begin with a 2 or a 3 , this theorem only excludes the two possibilities for universal sequences of knots that all the integers are even and that all the integers are divisible by 3 .    in section 3",
    ", we show that certain sequences are universal .",
    "for instance , we prove that @xmath29 is universal and that both @xmath30 for any integer @xmath31 and @xmath3 for any integer @xmath32 are universal .",
    "in fact , universal sequences need not be infinite .",
    "we prove that the sequence @xmath33 is universal for all @xmath34 .",
    "note that such diagrams have no bigons and as such , are called _ lune - free diagrams _ in @xcite . in that paper , the authors produce infinitely many lune - free diagrams , and show that such diagrams are realized for any number of vertices greater than 7 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that lune - free diagrams , particularly ones as simple as for instance @xmath35)-diagrams , yield projections for all knots .    finally , we prove that the sequence @xmath6 is universal .",
    "we end with some open questions .",
    "note that all of the proofs in this paper that sequences are universal do not alter the crossings in the original projection .",
    "because of this , the results appearing here can be stated in exactly the same form for any of the categories of virtual , flat , welded , and singular knots .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the fact that any projection can be made a projection of the trivial knot by changing crossings , a proof of which appears in several elementary knot theory texts .    the result from @xcite mentioned above together with results from @xcite which we utilize in the next section",
    "are both generalized to spatial embeddings of graphs in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : twoodd]every knot has a diagram with exactly two odd - sided faces , which can be made to be triangles .",
    "we take a @xmath36-colored diagram @xmath37 of a given knot @xmath9 such that neither colored arc crosses itself as we mentioned in section  [ s : intro ] .",
    "( see  [ ozawa - new ] . )",
    "all faces must have an even number of edges except for those that have transition vertices on their edges .",
    "then the diagram @xmath37 has two or four odd - sided regions as we discussed in section  [ s : intro ] .",
    "if @xmath37 has four odd - sided regions , we apply the following procedure .",
    "take a parallel copy @xmath38 of @xmath37 such that newly created crossings have the following crossing information .",
    "* for a crossing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the edge of @xmath38 is lower than that of @xmath37 , and * for a crossing both of whose edges belong to @xmath38 , the gray edge is lower than the black edge .",

    "( see  [ two - odd ] . )",

    "this is because this band surgery induces the connected sum of @xmath9 and the trivial knot .",
    "then we have a diagram of @xmath9 with exactly two odd - sided regions . by applying moves as in   [ triangle ] , we make these two odd - sided regions into two @xmath41-sided regions and even - sided regions .    ]",
    "[ thm : nodd]every link @xmath42 of @xmath7 components has a diagram with at most @xmath7 odd - sided faces if @xmath7 is even and @xmath8 odd - sided faces if @xmath7 is odd .",
    "the odd - sided faces can be made to be triangles .",
    "start with any projection of the @xmath7-component link @xmath42",
    ". then we can rearrange it to construct a region @xmath43 that has @xmath7 edges , each edge coming from a different component .",
    "put a transition vertex at the center of each edge , so that as we move clockwise around the boundary of the region , each edge is first black and then gray .",
    "so at least on the boundary of this region , there are no crossings of a single color .",
    "now we will rearrange the projection so that all crossings have only one color .",
    "as in the proof of theorem [ thm : two - coloring ] , start with one of the components and extend its black section until we have a valid 2-coloring of this component , pushing strands ahead as necessary . repeat this process with each link component in turn .",
    "we obtain a 2-coloration of the link such that no colored edge crosses itself .",
    "the @xmath7-gon @xmath43 remains and it contains a transition vertex between colors on each of its edges .    as in the proof of theorem [ thm : twoodd ] , all faces must have an even number of edges except for those that have transition vertices on their edges .",
    "if there are an odd number of edges with transition vertices on them , the face must have an odd number of edges .",
    "if there are an even number of edges with transition vertices , the face must have an even number of edges .    applying the doubling procedure as in the proof of theorem [ thm : twoodd ]",
    ", the second transitional vertex for each of the @xmath7 components can be made to share a quadrilateral with the first transitional vertex for that component .",
    "note that @xmath43 also survives this procedure .",
    "then each of these second transitional vertices can generate at most one odd - sided face , and @xmath43 itself is odd - sided if and only if @xmath7 is odd .",
    "hence the theorem results . as in the previous proof",
    ", we can convert the odd - sided regions into triangles .",
    "a sequence with a nontrivial common divisor @xmath44 can only realize links with at least @xmath44 components .",
    "suppose that @xmath45 divides all of the integers in the sequence .",
    "choosing any region @xmath43 to begin , its number of edges @xmath7 must satisfy @xmath46 for some integer @xmath47 .",
    "starting on one edge and traveling around the boundary of @xmath43 , we label each edge with consecutive integers @xmath48 , and then repeat @xmath47 times as we cycle around the boundary of @xmath43 . for each edge that has been labelled",
    ", we can extend its label to the edge that is opposite it at each of its endpoints . in this way",
    ", we obtain labelings on two of the edges of each regions that shares just a vertex with @xmath43 and three of the edges of a region that shares an edge with @xmath43 .",
    "extend these labels to an adjacent region so that the union of labeled regions remains topologically a disk .",
    "repeat this process until the entire diagram is labeled .",
    "to see that this method of labeling the edges in the diagram is well - defined , suppose that we have labeled it appropriately for @xmath7 faces , the union of which is the disk @xmath37 , and we are adding in an additional face @xmath49 . the face @xmath49 intersects the boundary of @xmath37 in an arc @xmath50 made up of the union of a collection of edges . at a vertex @xmath51 internal to the arc @xmath50 , the labeling of the face in @xmath37 opposite to @xmath49 at @xmath51 forces the two edges on the boundary of @xmath37 at @xmath51 to have consecutive labels .",
    "the labelings of the faces in @xmath37 containing those two edges force the labelings on the adjacent edges in @xmath50 to be consistent . at a vertex @xmath51 that is an endpoint of @xmath50 , the labeling on the face that contains the edge in @xmath50 that contains @xmath51 forces a consistent labeling of the subsequent edge in @xmath49 that can be extended around @xmath49 to obtain a consistent labeling of @xmath52 , as desired .",
    "hence , all the edges that make up a given component receive the same label .",
    "since @xmath44 labels appear , the diagram must have at least @xmath44 components .",
    "thus , in particular , knots can not have a diagram realized by an even sequence .",
    "the next lemma determines which links can be so realized .",
    "an @xmath7-component link @xmath42 is realized by an even sequence if and only if its components are all trivial and the components of @xmath42 can be subdivided into two nontrivial sets such that the complement of either set is a trivial link .",
    "if an @xmath7-component link is realized by an even sequence , then as in the proof of the preceding theorem , we can label the diagram with two labels such that each component receives a consistent label . since crossings only occur between distinctly labeled components , no component crosses itself and hence , all components are trivial .",
    "the two labels divide the components into two sets , such that the complement of either set has no crossings and therefore is the trivial link .    in the other direction ,",
    "theorem 2 of @xcite implies that there exists a single projection of @xmath42 such that each of the two subsets of components appears with no self - crossings .",
    "this implies that the two sets must alternate on the edges as we travel around the boundary of any region and therefore all of the regions in that projection must be even - sided .",
