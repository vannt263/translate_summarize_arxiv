    "cascade method has long been used to study nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , the oscar standard @xcitehas been passed to provide some objective scientific criteria for cascade simulations .",
    "one goal of the open standard working group is to develop and perform a set of standardized tests to ensure the applicability of the cascade method .",
    "one test we proposed is to compare the cascade prediction for time dependence of transverse energy with the scaling kinetic theory prediction .",
    "it s shown that zpc gives result which is in good agreement with the kinetic theory prediction when the isolated 2 body collision criteria is satisfied .",
    "the we go from 1 dimensional expansion to 3 dimensional expansion .",
    "the cascade gives us the transverse expansion information . with a model of the transverse expansion ,",
    "we see the kinetic theory gives consistent result with the cascade prediction .",
    "parton transport equation : @xmath0 can be simplified by changing variables to : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we put the partons in on a hyperbola of constant @xmath4 with boltzmann distribution , i.e. , the source term is : @xmath5    under relaxation time approximation , the solution of the above transport equation is : @xmath6 @xmath7    the proper energy density @xmath8 and the transverse energy per unit rapidity @xmath9 can be calculated from the above phase space distribution .",
    "we get : @xmath10 @xmath11 in which : @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14    the relaxation time @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the transport cross section .",
    "we take the differential cross section to be : @xmath17 such that the total cross section is @xmath18    notice many authors have studied the energy density equation @xcite @xcite , and a variable similar to transverse energy ( proper time times the energy density ) is introduced for calculational convenience . but experiments measure only transverse energy , and the transverse energy is not simply a product of proper time , transverse area and the energy density .",
    "it can not be simply calculated from one integral equation , but has to be calculated from a set of couple integral equations including the energy density evolution equation .",
    "the parton cascade gives reasonably good result for the time development of the transverse energy per unit rapidity as seen in fig .",
    "it is difficult to solve kinetic equation semianalytically with the transverse expansion .",
    "but we can get the transverse expansion information from the cascade and using a model for the transverse expansion to make the semianalytical calculation possible .",
    "a model for freezeout is to assume that the @xmath19 freezes out outside the rarefaction front , i.e. , @xmath20 the contribution to @xmath19 from inside the rarefaction front is just the rescaled ( by the effective area inside the rarefaction front ) contribution derived before : @xmath21 @xmath22    the cascade gives the weight function for the transverse area : @xmath23    this weight function is almost independent of interaction .",
    "the effective transverse area can be calculated from : @xmath24    the model results ( fig .",
    "2 ) are similar to the cascade prediction .",
    "both of them give more transverse energy production than the 1-d expansion .",
    "for the 1 dimensional expansion , zpc s prediction for the time development of the transverse energy production is consistent with the kinetic theory prediction . with the model motivated by the cascade",
    ", we can perform the semianalytic calculation of the kinetic theory and give out consistent result with the cascade s .",
