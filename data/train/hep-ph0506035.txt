    "the discovery of the pentaquark state @xmath12 has opened a new field of strong interaction and provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the low energy qcd .",
    "intense theoretical studies have been motivated to clarify the quantum numbers and to understand the under - structures of the pentaquark state @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although the existence of the @xmath12 is uncertain and is a subject of controversy now , the @xmath12 has already contributed to hadron spectroscopy . unlike the chiral soliton model ,",
    "the quark models take the constituent quarks or quark clusters as the elementary degrees of freedom , there exist a great number of possible quark configurations satisfy the fermi statistics and the color singlet condition for the substructures of the pentaquark state @xmath12 if we release stringent dynamical constraints .",
    "in fact , the multiquark states are many - body problems , they are very difficult to solve .",
    "whether or not the quarks can cluster together to form diquarks is of great importance theoretically , if we take the diquarks as the basic constituents ( here the `` basic constituents '' does not mean they are asymptotic states , they just exist inside the baryons or multiquark states with typical length ) , the problems will be greatly simplified , for example , the @xmath13 octet and @xmath14 decuplet baryons can be taken as quark - diquark bound states in the faddeev approximation @xcite , the nonet scalar mesons below @xmath15 can be taken as 4-quark states @xmath16 with scalar diquarks or pseudoscalar diquarks as their basic constituents @xcite ; furthermore , we can obtain more insight into the relevant degrees of freedom and deepen our understanding about the underlying dynamics that determines the properties of the baryons and exotic multiquark states .",
    "a typical quark model for the pentaquark states is the jaffe - wilczek s diquark - diquark - antiquark model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the scalar diquarks @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are taken as the basic constituents .",
    "they belong to the antitriplet @xmath20 representation of both the color @xmath21 group and flavor @xmath22 group , in the color superconductivity theory , the attractive interactions in this channel lead to the formulation of nonzero condensates and breaking of both the color and flavor @xmath23 symmetries @xcite . the scalar diquarks correspond to the @xmath24 states of the diquark systems , the one - gluon exchange force and the instanton induced force can lead to significant attractions between the quarks in the @xmath25 channels @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar diquarks do not have nonrelativistic limit , can be taken as the @xmath26 states . as the instanton induced force results in strong attractions in the scalar diquark channel and strong repulsions in the pseudoscalar diquark channel ,",
    "if the effects of the instanton are manifested , we prefer the @xmath27 type diquark to the @xmath28 type diquark in constructing interpolating currents in the qcd sum rules @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we take the point of view that the scalar diquarks are quasi - bound states of quark - quark system and study the ground state mass spectrum within the framework of the coupled schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) and bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "the coupled rainbow sde and ladder bse have given a lot of successful descriptions of the long distance properties of the low energy qcd and the qcd vacuum ( for reviews , one can see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the sde can naturally embody the dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement which are two crucial features of qcd , although they correspond to two very different energy scales @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bse is a conventional approach in dealing with the two - body relativistic bound state problems @xcite . from the solutions of the bse",
    ", we can obtain useful information about the under - structures of the mesons and diquarks , and obtain powerful tests for the quark theory .",
    "however , the obviously drawback may be the model dependent kernels for the gluon two - point green s function and the truncations for the coupled divergent sde and bse series in one or the other ways @xcite .",
    "many analytical and numerical calculations indicate that the coupled rainbow sde and ladder bse with phenomenological potential models can give model independent results and satisfactory values @xcite .",
    "the usually used effective potential models are confining dirac @xmath29 function potential , gaussian distribution potential and flat bottom potential ( fbp ) @xcite .",
    "the fbp is a sum of yukawa potentials , which not only satisfies chiral invariance and fully relativistic covariance , but also suppresses the singular point that the yukawa potential has .",
    "it works well in understanding the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , confinement and the qcd vacuum as well as the meson structures , such as electromagnetic form factors , radius , decay constants @xcite . in this article",
    ", we use the fbp to study the ground state mass spectrum of the scalar diquarks without fine tuning such as modifying the infrared behavior for the heavy quark systems .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we introduce the fbp in section ii ; in section iii , iv and v , we solve the rainbow sde and ladder bse , explore the analyticity of the quark propagators , study the dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement , finally obtain the mass spectrum of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons and the scalar @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 diquarks , and the decay constants of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons ; section vi is reserved for conclusion .",
    "the present techniques in qcd calculation can not give satisfactory large @xmath30 behavior for the gluon two - point green s function to implement the linear potential confinement mechanism , in practical calculation , the phenomenological effective potential models always do the work .",
    "the fbp is a sum of yukawa potentials which is an analogy to the exchange of a series of particles and ghosts with different masses ( euclidean form ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the minimum value of the masses , @xmath33 is their mass difference , and @xmath34 is their relative coupling constant . due to the particular condition",
    "we take for the fbp , there is no divergence in solving the sde . in its three dimensional form , the fbp takes the following form : @xmath35 in order to suppress the singular point at @xmath36 , we take the following conditions : @xmath37 the @xmath34 can be determined by solving the equations inferred from the flat bottom condition in eq.(3 ) . as in previous literature @xcite , @xmath38 is set to be 9 .",
    "the sde can provide a natural framework for studying the nonperturbative properties of the quark and gluon green s functions . by studying the evolution behavior and analytic structure of the dressed quark propagators",
    ", we can obtain valuable information about the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement . in the following ,",
    "we write down the rainbow sde for the quark propagator , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , \\\\ g_{\\mu \\nu } ( k)&=&(\\delta_{\\mu \\nu}-\\frac{k_{\\mu}k_{\\nu}}{k^2})g(k^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 stands for the current quark mass that breaks chiral symmetry explicitly . for a short discussion about the full sde for the quark propagator",
    ", one can consult ref.@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we assume that a wick rotation to euclidean variables is allowed , and perform a rotation analytically continuing @xmath42 and @xmath43 into the euclidean region .",
    "alternatively , one can derive the sde from the euclidean path - integral formulation of the theory , thus avoiding possible difficulties in performing the wick rotation @xmath44 .",
    "as far as only numerical results are concerned , the two procedures are equal .",
    "in fact , the analytical structures of quark propagators have interesting information about confinement , we will make detailed discussion about the propagators of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks in section v.",
    "the bse is a conventional approach in dealing with the two - body relativistic bound state problems @xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge about the quark structures of the mesons and diquarks can result in better understanding of their properties . in the following , we write down the ladder bse for the scalar diquark quasi - bound states with two quarks of different flavor @xcite , @xmath45 here @xmath46 denotes matrix transpose",
    ", the @xmath47 is the quark propagator , @xmath48 is the gluon propagator , @xmath49 is the four - momentum of the center of mass of the scalar diquark , @xmath50 is the relative four - momentum between the two quarks , @xmath51 is the bare quark - gluon vertex , and @xmath52 is the bethe - salpeter amplitude of the quasi - bound state ( or diquark ) .",
    "the @xmath53 is the center of mass parameter which can be chosen to vary between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for the @xmath4 diquark , @xmath56 , for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 diquarks , as the current quark masses @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath53 is about @xmath59 .",
    "we can introduce an auxiliary amplitude @xmath60 to facilitate the calculation , @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the auxiliary amplitude @xmath60 satisfies the following equation , @xmath63 it is obviously the above equation is identical to the bse for the pseudoscalar mesons but a reduction in the coupling strength , @xmath64 .",
    "we can introduce the bethe - salpeter wavefunction ( bsw ) @xmath65 for the quasi - bound states , @xmath66 to relate with our previously works on the pseudoscalar meson s bse , @xmath67    we can perform the wick rotation analytically and continue @xmath68 and @xmath43 into the euclidean region .",
    "the bsws of the scalar diquarks @xmath65 and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath69 have the same dirac structures , can be signed by the notation @xmath70 . in the lowest order approximation ,",
    "the bsw @xmath70 can be written as @xmath71 f_4^{0}(q , p ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in solving the bses , it is important to translate the wavefunctions @xmath72 into the same dimension , @xmath73 here the @xmath74 is some quantity of the dimension of mass .",
    "the ladder bses for the scalar diquarks and pseudoscalar mesons can be projected into the following four coupled integral equations , @xmath75 the expressions of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 are cumbersome and neglected here .",
    "we can introduce a parameter @xmath78 and solve the above equations as an eigenvalue problem .",
    "if there really exist a quasi - bound state of two - quark , the masses of the diquarks can be determined by the condition @xmath79 , @xmath80    here we will take a short digression and give some explanations for the expressions of @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath76 s are functions of the quark s schwinger - dyson functions ( sdf ) @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the relative four - momentum @xmath68 is a quantity in the euclidean spacetime while the center of mass four - momentum @xmath28 must be continued to the minkowski spacetime i.e. @xmath85 , this results in that the @xmath86 varies throughout a complex domain .",
    "it is inconvenient to solve the sde with the resulting complex values of the quark momentum",
    ". we can expand the @xmath87 and @xmath88 in terms of taylor series of @xmath86 , for example , @xmath89 the other problem is that we can not solve the sde in the timelike region as the two - point gluon green s function can not be exactly inferred from the @xmath23 color gauge theory even in the low energy spacelike region . in practical calculations , we can extrapolate the values of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the spacelike region smoothly to the timelike region with suitable polynomial functions . to avoid possible violation with confinement in sense of the appearance of pole masses @xmath90 in the timelike region , we must be care in choosing the polynomial functions @xcite .",
    "finally we write down the normalization condition for the bsws of the pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath91 here @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in this article , the parameters of fbp are fitted to give the correct masses and decay constants for the pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the normalization condition is needed .",
    "in this section , we study the coupled equations of the rainbow sde and ladder bse for the pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and scalar diquarks ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) numerically , the final results for the sdfs and bsws can be plotted as functions of the square momentum @xmath95 .    in order to demonstrate the confinement of quarks",
    ", we have to study the analyticity of the sdfs of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , and prove that there are no mass poles on the real timelike @xmath95 axial . in the following ,",
    "we take the fourier transform with respect to the euclidean time t for the scalar part ( @xmath96 ) of the quark propagator @xcite , @xmath97 where the 3-vector part of @xmath68 is set to zero .",
    "if s(q ) has a mass pole at @xmath90 in the real timelike region , the fourier transformed @xmath98 would fall off as @xmath99 for large t or @xmath100 . in our numerical calculations , for small @xmath46 ,",
    "the values of @xmath101 are positive and decrease rapidly to zero and beyond with the increase of @xmath46 , which are compatible with the result ( curve tendency with respect to @xmath46 ) from lattice simulations @xcite ; for large @xmath46 , the values of @xmath101 are negative , except occasionally a very small fraction of positive values .",
    "the negative values for @xmath101 indicate an explicit violation of the axiom of reflection positivity @xcite , in other words , the quarks are not physical observable i.e. confinement . as colored quantity , the diquarks should also be confined and not appear as asymptotic states ; the demonstration of their confinement is beyond the present work .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks have small current masses , the dressing or renormalization is very large and the curves of the sdfs are steep , which are corresponding to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon for the light quarks . at zero momentum , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which are compatible with the constituent quark masses in the literature . from the solutions of bses for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons and @xmath2 , @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 diquarks as eigenvalue problems , we can obtain the masses for those pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquarks , @xmath104 it is obviously @xmath105 the attractive interaction between the quarks in the color and flavor @xmath23 @xmath20 channel can lead to the quasi - bound states in the infrared region .",
    "the appearance of the diquarks is closely related to the dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon , the mass splitting among the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 diquarks originate from the mass splitting among @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",

    "just like the @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , the gaussian type bsws of the scalar diquarks center around zero momentum and extend to the energy scale about @xmath8 which happen to be the energy scale for the chiral symmetry breaking , the strong interactions in the infrared region result in quasi - bound states , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "however , for the diquarks and scalar mesons , the large repulsive corrections from the nlo contributions can significantly change the scalar meson masses and corresponding bsws ; the diquark quasi - bound states found in the ladder bse will disappear from the spectrum . in this article , we do not take the point of view that the scalar diquarks exist in the strong interaction spectrum as asymptotic states , and our conclusion do not conflict with ref.@xcite ; the confinement precludes the observation of the free colored diquarks , the quark - quark can correlate with each other in the color and flavor @xmath20 channels inside the baryons and multi - quark states with typical length @xmath123 . in fact , the nlo contributions from the quark - gluon vertex are extremely difficult to take into account if we go beyond the infrared dominated @xmath29 function approximation for the gluon kernel , which is obviously violate the lorentz invariance ; the lorentz invariant and model - independent treatments still lack in the literatures .    in calculation , the values of current quark masses are taken as @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; the input parameters for the fbp are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are fitted to give the correct masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . in this article",
