    "in our previous papers @xcite we have investigated the evolution of the counts and colours of faint field galaxies , culminating in extremely deep optical imaging of a representative region of sky we call the `` herschel deep field '' @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present new near - infrared observations of this field , and combine this data with our existing ultra - deep optical imagery .",
    "near - infrared observations have many advantages which are oft - quoted in the literature , among them , the insensitivity of the @xmath20 correction to type or star - formation history at intermediate redshifts is perhaps the most relevant in a cosmological setting .",
    "previously we have considered our observations in the context of pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) models .",
    "recently , additional support for these models has come from fully complete , blue - selected , redshift surveys @xcite which have revealed the presence of an extended tail in the redshift distribution , partially resolving the paradox that non - evolving galaxy formation models could be used to fit the results of the early faint redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "such models , as we have shown , are able to reproduce all the observable quantities of the faint field galaxy population ( counts , colours , redshift distributions ) at least for low @xmath21 universes and within current observational uncertainties .",
    "high @xmath21 universes can be accommodated by the model if we add an extra population of low luminosity galaxies with constant star - formation rates which boost the counts at faint ( @xmath22 ) magnitude levels @xcite . in the ple model",
    ", galaxies form monolithically at high redshift .",
    "changes in luminosity and colour after the formation event are modelled with stellar population synthesis models . @xmath6",
    "selected galaxy samples , at least until @xmath23 , are dominated by early - type galaxies ; therefore , changes in optical - infrared galaxy colours are particularly sensitive to evolution of this galaxy class . by investigating near - infrared number counts and colour distributions we can potentially address questions concerning the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    ".photometric limits of the herschel deep field . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ext - col - obj ]    table [ tab : ext - col - obj ] presents a compilation of observations from these papers as well as our current work .",
    "we also show the predictions of the @xmath24 and scalo @xmath25 model ( our model which most closely approximates a single burst ) , normalised to the total numbers of objects each magnitude slice .",
    "generally , in the brighter bin @xmath26 the only substantial comparison that we can make is with .",
    "we see a factor @xmath27 more objects than they do , although this represents only a @xmath17 discrepancy . in the fainter bin @xmath28",
    "our numbers of red objects agree well with .",
    "although our numbers are higher than in this range there is still no significant discrepancy due principally to our small area .    compared their observations to the predictions of a passively - evolving @xmath29  gyr model elliptical population , and concluded that the numbers of @xmath14 objects observed disagreed with the predictions of this model .",
    "our @xmath25  gyr distribution ( solid dot - dashed line ) in figure  [ fig : ikhists ] is quite similar to this model , and in the @xmath15 magnitude slice we can see from table  [ tab : ext - col - obj ] that it does indeed produce a large number of objects with @xmath14 which are not seen in our observations .",
    "we therefore conclude , as did , that the low numbers of objects with @xmath14 observed at @xmath15 disfavour non - evolving and passively evolving models ( the constraints on the models which can be obtained from the distributions at fainter magnitudes are less significant ) . however , we note that the @xmath24 , @xmath30  gyr and @xmath31  gyr scalo models do correctly reproduce the observed colour distributions .",
    "this is because both these models contain enough on - going star - formation to move galaxy colours sufficiently blueward to match the observations .",
    "lastly , could a merging model , like those adopted by , produce these results ?",
    "it is not possible to rule this model out from the redshift data and it may even be said that the difficulty that models with standard scalo imf s have in fitting the @xmath32 redshift distribution is evidence in favour of the merging scenario .",
    "we therefore consider whether the @xmath6 selected @xmath8 and @xmath33 colour distributions presented here can discriminate between a ple @xmath34 model and a merging model .",
    "the @xmath6 selected @xmath8 distributions in figure  [ fig : bkhists ] can be understood in terms of either scenario ; the red galaxies that are missing at @xmath35 may either be due to them becoming blue at high redshift due to continuing star - formation or passive evolution  or because they are fainter than expected due to de - merging ( although our lack of red galaxies even at the faintest limits implies either several magnitudes of fading or that the pre - merger components are blue ) .",
    "however , as we have already noted the @xmath33-@xmath36 relation for e / s0 galaxies is insensitive to changes in @xmath37 or the imf .",
    "furthermore , in the range @xmath38 some galaxies with the @xmath39 colour expected of @xmath40 elliptical galaxies are detected ( figure [ fig : ikhists ] ) .",
    "indeed the numbers of these galaxies we see is within a factor of @xmath41 of what is predicted on the basis of the scalo , @xmath25  gyr model and in even better agreement with the @xmath24 , @xmath30  gyr models or even a scalo @xmath31  gyr model .",
    "if the merging model is the explanation of the large deficiency of red galaxies in @xmath8 compared to passively evolving models , then it might be expected that a similar deficiency should be seen in @xmath33 . since",
    "the deficiency in @xmath33 is less , then this might be taken to be an argument _ against _ merging and _ for _ the @xmath24 ple model .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of two near - infrared surveys to @xmath9 and @xmath42 which cover our ultra - deep ( @xmath43 ) optical fields .",
    "we draw the following conclusions from this work :    our k number counts are consistent with the predictions of non - evolving models with @xmath7 .    as previously noted by , , and the @xmath18 @xmath44 of is also well fitted by non - evolving models .",
    "however , passively evolving models with a salpeter / scalo imf predict too many galaxies with @xmath19 .",
    "dynamical merging is one possible solution to reduce the numbers of these galaxies but we have shown that a dwarf - dominated imf for early - types could offer an alternative explanation .",
    "our @xmath6 selected @xmath8 colour distributions display a strong bluewards trend for galaxies fainter than @xmath9 , confirming results previously observed in the shallower surveys of .    at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath45  mag )",
    "our @xmath6 selected @xmath8 distributions indicate a deficiency of red , early - type galaxies at @xmath11 compared to the predictions of passively evolving models .",
    "this implies either a ple model where star - formation continues at a low level after an initial burst or dynamical merging .    at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath28 )",
    "the continuing bluewards trend observed in @xmath8 can be explained purely in terms of passively evolving ple models with no need to invoke any additional mechanisms .",
    "our observed numbers of @xmath14 galaxies at @xmath9 are lower than the predictions of passively evolving models or ple models with a low level of continuing star - formation , suggesting that at least part of the larger deficiency observed in @xmath8 at @xmath9 may be due to star - formation rather than dynamical merging .    in the range @xmath15 , where our statistical uncertainties are lowest",
    ", we detect @xmath46 red galaxies arcmin@xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we see a factor @xmath27 more objects than do although this represents only a @xmath17 discrepancy .",
    "the ple models discussed here suggest these galaxies will have redshifts @xmath47 .",
    "the numbers of these galaxies are consistent with the predictions of ple models with small amounts of ongoing star - formation .",
    "we have recently completed a @xmath48 band survey of the herschel field using the @xmath49 rockwell hgcdte array at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope .",
