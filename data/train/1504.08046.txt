    "cryptography is one of the most promising applications of quantum science  @xcite . with the recent demonstrations of high - dimensional two - photon entanglement using time bins",
    "@xcite and oam  @xcite , large - alphabet entanglement - based quantum key distribution ( qkd ) systems become closer to their real - world implementations and applications .",
    "the traditional approach to large - alphabet qkd based on bell s theorem involves verifying the security of the generated key using a test of a bell inequality .",
    "this is a straighforward generalization of the original protocol introduced by ekert in 1991 ( e91 )  @xcite and    e91-based protocols have been demonstrated for qubits using  @xcite and using time - energy entanglement  @xcite .",
    "a bell - type test of energy - time entangled qutrits has also been realised  @xcite . reported experiments using oam qutrits  @xcite have implemented a randomized selection of dichotomous measurements instead of full projective measurements in a 3-dimensional state space .",
    "although projective measurement for detection of high - dimensional oam states of light with up to 11 different outcomes is now within reach  @xcite , it still remains an experimental challenge to perform in arbitrary qudit bases . in the case of high - dimensional time - bin states",
    ", such unitary operations would require multi - path interferometric setups which become cumbersome to implement for a high number of dimensions .",
    "@xcite , the applicability of this scheme is specific to this kind of entanglement and the security verification is highly device dependent as it places stringent conditions on timing resolutions of the detectors , which limits .",
    "security verification of quantum key distribution schemes is a complicated problem in general .",
    "security proofs have been provided for bell - test - based qkd against the so - called collective attacks  @xcite as well as the most general coherent attacks in the standard security scenarios  @xcite . however , proofs of device - independent security against these sophisticated attacks are not yet available in the case of entangled qudits requiring bell tests generalised to high - dimensions  @xcite .    here",
    ", we propose an approach to large - alphabet entanglement - based qkd which circumvents these problems by avoiding the need to perform high - dimensional unitary rotations required for measurements in different mutually unbiased bases , resulting in a much simplified measurement setup .",
    "the scheme presented here also benefits from security proofs for qkd based on entangled qubits against collective attacks .",
    "is in principle applicable to any system in which it is possible to create bipartite two - dimensional entanglement in one degree of freedom and high - dimensional correlations in another .",
    "although we will use an example with photon polarization and oam to illustrate the protocol , the principle can be applied to other systems using other degrees of freedom to encode secret keys . .",
    "the development of oam sorters genuine large - alphabet key generation using up to 11-dimensional oam entanglement .",
    "this will also allow for a higher data rate per photon pair , as the detection of the photonic qudits would not need to be implemented as ( probabilistic ) dichotomous measurements as has been the case in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is also straightforward to implement projective measurements in computational ( unrotated ) time - bin bases . in what follows",
    ", we will first describe the existing generalizations of the e91 protocol .",
    "we will then describe the source state , measurement setup , and security considerations for our proposed scheme .",
    "finally , we will conclude with a few remarks on the realizability of the proposed experimental implementations .",
    "to establish our scheme , let us first review the entanglement - based large - alphabet qkd . assume a source producing photon pairs in the state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes tensor product . in terms of oam eigenstates",
    "@xmath2 for example , this may be written as the maximally entangled state @xmath3 for all @xmath4 when @xmath5 is odd , and @xmath6 , when @xmath5 is even .    in a bell inequality test experiment ,",
    "each of the communicating parties ` alice ' ( a ) and ` bob ' ( b ) have a photon oam detector with and two settings / measurements : @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , which maximize bell inequality violation .",
    "alice and bob independently choose their settings at random and also note their detection results independently .",
    "after sufficiently many measurement runs , alice and bob    to determine the security of this key , the correlation in the rest of the data will be checked for eavesdropping through a bell inequality test , for example using bell inequalities generalised to @xmath5-outcomes per measurement proposed by collins _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , equivalent to the chsh - bell inequality  @xcite @xmath9 .",
    "only cases in which the combination of measurement settings involve @xmath10 and @xmath11 are used for this test , while the remaining results are discarded .",
    "after basis reconciliation , bob announces his data for the bell inequality check , and alice computes the value of the bell parameter @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 , then the key is secure and the eavesdropper , eve , will not have gained any useful information on the key .",
    "the secret key can then be used in any cryptographic communication between alice and bob .",
    "implementing the above requires full projective measurements in the oam state basis @xmath14 in a @xmath5-dimensional subspace , corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "this be realized , e.g. for up to @xmath16 using oam mode sorters as mentioned above .",
    "however , full projective measurements whose operators have eigenstates which are oam superpositions are also required .",
    "it is nontrivial to realize such measurements because it requires a unitary operation within the high - dimensional oam subspace being considered before the oam detection .",
    "the implementations of such operations are difficult to derive in general , and have not realized experimentally .",
    "we propose a state which replaces the need for measurements in high - dimensional rotated bases with the simplicity of a two - dimensional chsh bell test for the verification of the security of generated key . to appreciate how our source state relates to hybrid entangled states , consider the state expressed in terms of the composite oam and polarisation states @xmath17 ( where @xmath4 denotes the oam , @xmath18 ; and @xmath19 denotes the prolarization @xmath20 ) as @xmath21 for even @xmath5 .",
    "note that this state combines orbital angular momentum entanglement and polarization entanglement in a way similar but quite different from the cases of the so - called hyper - entangled  @xcite , hypoentangled   or entangled entangled  @xcite states . in hyper - entanglement , a measurement of oam will not destroy polarization entanglement and vice versa . in hypoentanglement , measuring either polarization or oam destroys entanglement in the other degree of freedom . here measuring oam completely destroys polarization entanglement , but the converse is not true .",
    "we note that the division of the subspaces ( e.g. into odd and even oam parities in this example ) can also be done in other ways , depending on the specific realization and experimental convenience",
    ". state   can be rewritten , as @xmath22 is an entangled state within the @xmath23th oam subspace .",
    "although this state is ( hypo)entangled in both polarization and oam , only the classical correlation in oam is strictly necessary for our scheme .",
    "+   + * source state : * our source state is of the form @xmath24 is an entangled state in polarisation within an oam subspace specified by @xmath23 .",
    "the source state could be obtained either by post - selection or deterministically ( denoted by superscripts p and d respectively ) as outlined below .",
    "suppose we define @xmath25    note that this state is a combination of @xmath5 photon pairs , with each pair hypoentangled in both polarisation and oam in unique oam subspaces .    a source state for our scheme [ of the form eq .",
    "] could be obtained by post - selection from latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : mstatemulti3 }    which is a product state of @xmath5 pairs of oam - entangled photons where @xmath27 is the two - photon state expressed in eq .  . a proposed scheme to obtain @xmath28 from common spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc )",
    "sources is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1](a ) .",
    "this involves generating oam entanglement by type - i collinear parametric downconversion with a defined polarization , say horizontal ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the co - propagating photon pairs entangled in oam are passed through an oam parity ( even / odd ) sorter  @xcite .",
    "a half - wave plate is then inserted after one of the output arms which rotates @xmath29 to vertical polarization @xmath30 , coupling oam parity to polarization .",
    "the state represented in eq .",
    "could then be generated by choosing parameters of the spdc source to create more than one entangled photon pair simultaneously .",
    "it is well known that a desired probability of multiple pair generation per pump pulse can be achieved according to the theoretical @xmath5-pair creation probability  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real - valued coupling coefficient which is proportional to the product of the pump amplitude and the coupling constant between the electromagnetic field and the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the source state for our scheme can then be obtained by final postselection on state represented by eq .",
    ". this can be done by registering only the values of @xmath23 for which both alice and bob have a detection per oam subspace in one run . to achieve this , it suffices to use detectors which distinguish between zero , one , and more than one photon .",
    "such detectors have been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "also , actual photon - number - resolving detectors have been realised ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) with increased detection efficiencies  @xcite .      a more suitable approach , however , is to prepare the source state in a deterministic way by , e.g. , using an array of @xmath5 polarization - entangled - photon sources ( eps ) generating exactly one photon pair at a time .",
    "existing semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) systems provide a suitable platform for single photon generation  @xcite , as well as generation of entangled photon pairs on demand with high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "rapid experimental progress is also being made towards implementing arrays consisting of several qd high - fidelity - entangled - photon - pair emitters on the same chip  @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a setup utilising @xmath5 eps ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup2 ] ) .",
    "oam of @xmath33 , for example , is then individually imprinted on photons emitted by the @xmath34 source to yield state resulting in basis states that are assigned as shown below .",
    "the photons in an entangled pair are usually generated using the biexciton - exciton - vacuum cascade , and are separable based on their wavelength .",
    "individual photons from different pairs may then be combined into one beam using an oam combiner ( i.e. , a coherent oam sorter operated in reverse ) to obtain the source state @xmath35 [ eq .  ] . for this case ,",
    "the entangled state @xmath36 within the @xmath23th subspace defined as @xmath37    we note that the source state[eq .",
    "[ eq : mstatemulti2 ] ] is essentially the same for both the probabilistic and deterministic preparations except for a change in the basis state assignment of the oam measurement .",
    "this basis selection is simply for the convenience of experimental implementation specific to each method of state preparation .",
    ", our scheme using the state also involves three measurement settings randomly and independently chosen by alice and bob .",
    "however , the settings @xmath10 and @xmath11 are now polarization measurements for maximal chsh - bell inequality violation .",
    "these measurement settings each have two outcomes `` + '' and `` - '' . for key generation ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 , ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are the same as described above .",
    "an important aspect of our scheme is to perform both key generation and bell tests _ individually _ in each @xmath23th subspace ( or channel ) , and _ simultaneously _ for all @xmath42 , using the same bell - test setup .      to achieve the simultaneous measurements for the case of the non - deterministic state preparation outlined in section  [ sec : nondet ] above , alice bob need to first perform local operations which make",
    "the respective oam states degenerate for orthogonal polarisations of alice s and bob s photons within each @xmath23th subspace , i.e. , to disentangle the polarisation and oam degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be achieved if , e.g. , alice ( bob ) subtracts ( adds)@xmath43 of oam for the vertically polarised photons [ using the combination of pbs1 , slm1 and pbs2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "this operation by alice and bob can be described by the transformations @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 note that this only causes a transformation of the basis states defined in eq .",
    "as follows , @xmath47 a combination of a hwp and a pbs can now carry out the bell - test polarisation measurements ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) for each value of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath48 where the correlation coefficients of the measurement @xmath49 performed by alice and @xmath50 by bob are defined as @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 are probabilities for equal and unequal outcomes respectively , determined experimentally using the coincidence each @xmath23th subspace .",
    "the detector settings for the chsh bell inequality violation could be specified as measurements in the bases @xmath54 , where if we set @xmath55 as values of @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , then we will and get the maximal violation of @xmath59 for each @xmath23th subspace of state  .",
    "when the state is prepared deterministically as described in section  [ sec : detprepst1 ] , operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 [ eqs .   and ] are not necessary for the measurements . as in the non - deterministic case ,",
    "the bell test is carried out using a combination of a hwp and pbs [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup2 ] ( b ) ] , but photon number resolution and final postselection are not required . due to the difference in basis assignment in this case , we redefine the detector settings for the chsh bell inequality violation as measurements in the bases @xmath62 , where latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : basezdet }     the optimum settings ( specified by @xmath56 ) for the hwp are the same as in eq .",
    "above , and the resulting bell operator for this case [ see eq .  ]",
    "is @xmath64    the state represented by eq .",
    "is also maximally entangled within the @xmath23th subspace for this case , and it gives a maximal violation of the chsh inequality based on operator   when the key has not been eavesdropped .",
    "any eavesdropping of the key is essentially a measurement strategy that will destroy polarisation entanglement which is used to establish the key .",
    "this in turn degrades the chsh bell inequality violation  @xcite .",
    "a _ collective attack _ is one in which the eavesdropper ( eve ) applies the same operation on each of alice s and bob s particles , other limitations . in particular",
    ", she is allowed to have access to a string of qubits from alice / bob at one time , .",
    "our scheme is essentially a multiplexing of multiple polarisation - entangled qubit pairs by means of a higher - dimensional degree of freedom , followed by independently testing the chsh bell inequality simultaneously ",
    "eve s access to one or more source states in our scheme is equivalent to her access to a string of qubits on which she can perform joint ( coherent ) measurements .",
    "therefore , the security of our scheme is completely guaranteed by the security of the individual qubit - based schemes against collective attacks  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , implies security against the most general , so - called coherent attacks  @xcite .",
    "these results apply fully to our large - alphabet protocol since it is equivalent to simultaneous but independent 2-qubit secure protocols .",
    "the bit rate generated securely against collective attacks as a function of bell parameters @xmath65  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the binary entropy and @xmath68 is the quantum bit error rate for channel @xmath23 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : securerate1nd ] , the larger the measured bell violation , the higher the secure key rate per run . a @xmath5-fold enhancement over the traditional 2-qubit schemes as a large - alphabet scheme , but uses a much simplified bell - test measurement setup compared to traditional large - alphabet .",
    "as a function of the bell parameter @xmath12 and the quantum bit - error rate ( qber ) @xmath69 , in a single run , for our scheme with a qubit - based e91-type protocol  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the quantum bit error rate @xmath69 and bell parameter for each channel is the same , i.e. , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 respectively for all @xmath23 .",
    "our scheme shows a @xmath5-fold enhancement in secure key rate.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "it results in a greatly simplified security verification and key generation setup which does not get more complicated with increasing @xmath5 , except for an increase in the number of output ports of the oam sorting device .",
    "it thereby provides a route to boosting the secure key rates in entanglement - based qkd without the usual increased complexity of bell tests in high dimensions .",
    "it also benefits from the relative tolerance two - dimensional bell tests to measurement error .",
    "although it is known that the amount of violation for an actual @xmath72-dimensional bell test increases with @xmath72 , these increments are marginal even in the ideal case , and level off as @xmath72 increases  @xcite the high sensitivity of the complicated measurement setup to errors will usually overwhelm these increments even for modest values of @xmath72 , resulting in smaller violations than in the qubit case .",
    "another advantage of our scheme where an spdc source is used is that non - maximal high - dimensional entanglement will not generally degrade the the verification of security .",
    "for example , . whereas , if generalised oam - based bell tests are used without procrustrean filtering , then a small spiral bandwidth might cause a failure of the bell test for an entangled state  @xcite . in summary , this paper has described a practical scheme in which a single chsh - bell test setup combined with a full projective measurement is sufficient for security verification even for a large - alphabet scheme capable of arbitrarily large key rates per run .",
    "the scheme is simpler to implement than existing generalizations of e91 protocol to high - dimensions because it circumvents measurements in mutually unbiased bases in high dimensions , while maintaining capacity for large key - rate and security against collective attacks .",
    "a second significant advantage is that non - maximal high - dimensional entanglement will not necessarily degrade of security .",
    "we point out that the scheme is realisable using current technology by mentioning two examples for generating applicable source states , namely , spontaneous parametric downconversion and , more suitably , source of single pairs of entangled photons , such as semiconductor quantum dots . from the point of view of real - world applications of high - dimensional qkd , judicious selection of basis states",
    "@xcite will increase resilience against decoherence induced by atmospheric turbulence in a free space .",
    "although this can be applied within the framework of this scheme , implementations with time bins  @xcite or path appear promising for long distance applications . the complexity of security verification in large - alphabet entanglement - based qkd makes it apparent that the simplified scheme presented here will likely enable otherwise infeasible secure key rates in qkd , enabling more practical implementations of entanglement - based technologies .",
