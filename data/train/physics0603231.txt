    "the search for a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron has been the subject of experimental investigations for nearly 50 years @xcite .",
    "it has generally been of interest as a test of the discrete space - time symmetries , and has more recently emerged as one of the most sensitive tests of physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "a nonzero edm ( @xmath1 ) would be a signal of time - reversal symmetry violation and has yet to be observed .",
    "the most sensitive upper limit to date , @xmath2  e - cm ( 90% c. l. ) , is derived from experiments performed on ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) @xcite .",
    "ucn have kinetic energies of a few hundred nanoelectron volts  less than the fermi potential of many substances  and are easily trapped .",
    "the neutron velocities in these experiments are small and randomized , which is very advantageous for the suppression of systematic effects associated with motional magnetic fields . a new edm search , with potentially unprecedented sensitivity ,",
    "is underway using ucn produced via the superthermal process ( the downscattering of cold neutrons by phonons ) in a superfluid helium bath and subsequently held in the bath @xcite .",
    "the statistical sensitivity @xmath3 of these experiments can be approximated by the expression : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is planck s constant , @xmath6 is the electric field to which the neutron sample is exposed , @xmath7 is the experimental measurement cycle time , @xmath8 is the number of neutrons sampled per cycle , and @xmath9 is the cumulative storage time . for the experiment under construction , the target neutron sample is @xmath10  @xmath11 , using neutrons downscattered from a dedicated beam at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) under construction at the oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the target sample time is @xmath12 500  s , which is expected to be determined primarily by the beta decay lifetime of the ucns held in the very inert environment of the superfluid bath .",
    "a total of about @xmath13 measurement cycles are expected , for a cumulative storage time of @xmath14  s. the target electric field is 50  kv  @xmath0 .",
    "the dielectric properties of liquid helium ( lhe ) are expected to be sufficient to meet the electric field design parameter , however , very little is known about these properties for volumes and electrode spacings appropriate to the experiment .",
    "the reference design calls for a measurement cell with a volume of about 4 liters of superfluid ( sf ) lhe , positioned between a set of parallel - plate high voltage ( hv ) electrodes of nominal area @xmath15  @xmath16 . the electrode spacing and hence the cell width",
    "is nominally @xmath17  cm .",
    "the existing data for the electric breakdown strength of lhe are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : projections ] , which is adapted from @xcite . at electrode spacings below 1  mm , breakdown fields",
    "well in excess of 300  kv  @xmath0 are observed .",
    "this reduces to 150  kv  @xmath0 for gaps of 1  cm , however . furthermore , as of the inception of the project described in this work , reliable data for larger spacings were not available in the literature .",
    "the extrapolation of the breakdown voltage to larger spacings suggested in @xcite is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is in kv  @xmath0 , @xmath20 is in cm and @xmath21 kv  @xmath22 .",
    "this extrapolation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : projections ] , and suggests an expected breakdown field of about 95  kv  @xmath0 at the nominal electrode spacing .",
    "this is well above the design target , if an extrapolation of nearly an order of magnitude in the electrode spacing is to be trusted .",
    "breakdown voltage vs. electrode spacing for saturated lhe .",
    "the black dots are existing experimental data from @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation suggested in @xcite is shown , together with the further reduction ( `` size effect limits '' ) expected in the edm experiment due to the larger volume of lhe relative to that in @xcite.,width=453 ]    as emphasized in @xcite , however , electric breakdown in cryogenic liquids is influenced by many factors , including the volume of stressed liquid .",
    "in particular , the expression @xmath23 is cited in @xcite as an order - of - magnitude estimate for the reduction in breakdown field @xmath24 as a function of the overall stressed volume @xmath25 , relative to reference values @xmath26 and @xmath27 . suggested values of the exponent @xmath28 range in the literature from about 0.08 to 0.17 . according to @xcite , the data in fig .  [",
    "fig : projections ] are obtained from an experiment with spherical electrodes of radius @xmath29  cm .",
    "assuming circular plate electrodes of the same radius for simplicity and the sake of an order - of - magnitude estimate , the stressed volume @xmath27 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath20 is the separation . substituting this and the relation @xmath31 for the stressed volume in the edm experiment into eq .",
    "[ eq : size_effect ] yields an estimate for the expected reduced breakdown field between the edm electrodes relative to the experiment in @xcite . as the breakdown voltage scales with the field for the parallel plate electrodes , scaling the extrapolated curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : projections ] by @xmath32 yields the plots labeled `` size effect limits '' in that figure .",
    "this is the modified expectation for the breakdown voltage in the edm experiment .",
    "the upper and lower bounds correspond to the exponent @xmath33 0.08 and 0.17 , respectively , suggesting a wide possible range in the vicinity of the design voltage ( about 375  kv for the 7.5  cm electrode gap ) .",
    "additional factors influencing breakdown cited in @xcite include surface roughness , stressing time , and liquid pressure , for which understanding and predictability are partial at best .",
    "furthermore , the foregoing data and discussion apply only to saturated lhe in the normal state .",
    "evidence presented in @xcite suggests additional reduction in breakdown strength for the sf state relevant to the edm experiment .",
    "this state of affairs motivates a direct experimental assessment of the dielectric properties of lhe at large volumes and electrode spacings , and in the sf state .",
    "in addition to the breakdown strength of lhe at large volumes , several other engineering parameters are of interest to the neutron edm experiment .",
    "of greater interest than the pure breakdown strength is a stable operating point , defined as the maximum voltage attainable with a breakdown probability of at most a few percent over the entire anticipated integration time of the experiment ( @xmath34  s ) .",
    "this value will ostensibly be chosen as the experimental operating voltage in order to protect the edm detection system , which will be squid  based and likely damaged in the event of a spark discharge .",
    "the electric field stability over time @xmath35 is also of interest , with a target of @xmath36% required over the course of a measurement cycle to suppress false edm signals generated by stray magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this translates into a leakage current upper limit of about 1  na for the edm hv system .",
    "the electric field uniformity @xmath37 is of similar importance , with a target of @xmath38% required over the experimental cell volume to further control systematics associated with motional magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally , direct application of the required voltages from an external power source would require electrical feedthroughs impractically large for the cryogenic environment .",
    "therefore , an apparatus has been designed to test a simple in - situ amplification mechanism in addition to testing the parameters listed above . in this mechanism ,",
    "a small initial potential is used to charge a variable , parallel  plate capacitor in the lhe volume .",
    "the potential source is then disconnected and the voltage amplified by separating the plates and reducing the capacitance . in the reference design of the final version of the edm experiment , the amplifier ( variable ) capacitor is connected in parallel to a pair of fixed capacitors ( with the nominal electrode dimensions mentioned above ) that flank the actual measurement cells @xcite . in the test system",
    "described here , only the variable capacitor has been prototyped , which should be sufficient to test the dielectric properties of lhe and to verify the amplification principle .",
    "the design chosen for the central volume of the test apparatus is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : centvol ] .",
    "it consists of a parallel - plate capacitor with cylindrical electrodes , mounted horizontally on the central axis of a cylindrical lhe tank .",
    "the electrodes of the parallel  plate capacitor are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : electrodes ] and their dimensions listed in table  [ tab : electrodes ] .",
    "both electrodes consist of hollow cylindrical shells of type 6061 aluminum .",
    "two small holes are bored into the outer edges of each electrode to allow for filling with lhe during operation .",
    "hv test system electrodes before installation in the central volume .",
    "the hv electrode is in the center .",
    "it is fixed to the solid aluminum plate at the left with three g-10 insulating stand  offs .",
    "the plate is in turn bolted ( and grounded ) to the inner surface of the central volume flange.,width=453 ]    the hv electrode is fixed to the inner surface of the central volume end flange with three insulating stand - offs .",
    "the movable ground electrode has the same diameter as the hv electrode but is narrower in profile .",
    "an aluminum rod attaches to the rear of the electrode and connects to a welded bellows for position control along the axis normal to the electrode surfaces .",
    "since the amplification signal is essentially dc , hv data are taken with the input filter on the current amplifier set to low - pass .",
    "specifically the cutoff frequency is set to 3  hz and the roll - off to 12  db / octave . to simulate these conditions ,",
    "tests are performed with a signal generator connected to the input of the amplifier , with the same filter settings , through a 20  m@xmath39 series resistor .",
    "output signals similar in rise time , fwhm , and decay time to the transients in the hv data can be obtained with square pulses 10  ms long and separated in time by a few hundred ms .",
    "the pulse amplitude is attenuated by about a factor of 5 .",
    "it is therefore probable that the transient signal shape in the hv data is determined largely by the amplifier input filter .",
    "the actual transient phenomena are likely significantly faster ( at most a few ms ) and larger ( up to a few tens of na ) .",
    "the last three observations enumerated above suggest that transients increase under conditions progressively more favorable for bubble formation on the cathode electrode .",
    "bubbles with radii on the order of @xmath40 0.11  mm are observed to form on the ground electrode during the initial charging of the system before an amplification test .",
    "they usually appear after a positive potential of 10  kv or more has been established across the 23  mm gap , though detailed observations of bubble formation and the conditions under which it occurs or is enhanced have yet to be made .",
    "the formation of bubbles in the gap can lead to a coincident increase in the observed current at a particular gap voltage .",
    "this is because the dielectric constant of helium vapor or vacuum ( @xmath41 ) is lower than that of the normal state or sf liquid ( @xmath42 ) ; bubble formation leads to a decrease in the hv  ground electrode capacitance . to estimate this effect , the change in capacitance @xmath43 due to the formation of a bubble of radius @xmath44",
    "is @xmath45 . for bubbles of radius @xmath40 0.11  mm , @xmath46 0.55  ff . a bubble protruding 0.11  mm from the ground electrode in a typical field between in the gap of 20  kv  @xmath0 sits at an average potential of 2002000  v.",
    "while the time evolution of bubble formation in the system has not been studied , the formation of one of the larger bubbles on a time scale of @xmath47  ms would lead to a current spike on the order of @xmath48  na , consistent with the amplitude of the observed transients .",
    "the sign of this current signal follows the sign of the voltage , also consistent with observations .",
    "while this model provides an ostensible explanation of the transients , one drawback is that current signals of opposite sign , associated with the recovery of the capacitance once the bubbles detach from the electrode and drift out of the gap , are expected to be observed as well",
    ". a lower limit on the average escape time of a bubble from the gap can be estimated from the buoyant and drag forces on the bubbles in the liquid .",
    "once detached from the electrode , bubbles float toward the surface of the lhe under the influence of the buoyant force @xmath49 , where @xmath19 is the bubble volume , @xmath50 is the liquid density ( assumed constant through the bath depth at @xmath51  kg m@xmath52 ) and @xmath53 is the acceleration due to gravity . for bubbles with @xmath54  mm , this force is initially about 5  @xmath55n .",
    "motion of the bubble up through the liquid is opposed by a drag force @xmath56 , as well as an added  mass force @xmath57 induced by the displacement of the fluid surrounding the bubble as it rises @xcite . for the case of spherical bubbles in a viscous fluid , @xmath58 here , @xmath59  pa  s is the viscosity of the normal - state component of the lhe at 2.1  k , and * v * and @xmath60 are the bubble velocity and acceleration .",
    "setting the buoyant force equal to the sum of the drag and added  mass forces , and neglecting the bubble mass , the equation of motion for a rising bubble reduces to : @xmath61 due to the low density of the lhe , the hydrostatic pressure at any point along the electrode surfaces is determined almost exclusively by the vapor pressure above the bath , even for the lowest vapor pressures ( @xmath62 30 torr ) attained .",
    "therefore the radius of a rising bubble remains essentially unchanged , and the coefficient of the @xmath63 term is constant . for a bubble with @xmath64  mm",
    ", the coefficient is about 0.1  s@xmath65 , implying that a rising bubble does not reach an appreciable fraction of its terminal velocity for @xmath66  s and accelerates out of the gap with @xmath67 .",
    "assuming on average that bubbles form near the middle of the electrode , bubbles have to float up from rest through about 20  cm of lhe to escape the gap ; the average escape time is at least 100  ms .",
    "the recovery of the capacitance presumably occurs as the bubble drifts out though the fringe field near the rounded edge of the electrode , over a time period shorter than but on the order of the escape time .",
    "if this interval is 10  ms or greater , the observed ( opposite  sign ) current transient for a bubble escaping the gap would be at most about 1  na , just above the resolution determined by the noise in the readout ( see , for example , the baseline in fig .",
    "[ fig : transients]b ) .",
    "this suggests that only the largest bubbles escaping the gap would have a nominally visible effect , though the full implication for the model as to whether bubbles must remain attached to the electrodes ( or must otherwise be prevented from a fast escape from the gap ) is unclear .",
    "nevertheless , if correct , the model suggests that the transients do not correspond to an actual accumulation of charge during amplification and can be removed from the data sets to assess the actual voltages attained in the hv system .",
    "however , the model is based only on a few casual observations during initial operation of the system .",
    "more careful studies of the actual signal profiles of the transients , as well as of bubble formation , size , and number density as a function of time , vapor pressure , applied voltage and electrode surface roughness will need to be carried out in the near future .",
