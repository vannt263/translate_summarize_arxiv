    "a calculation of hadron parameters from sum rules in qcd @xcite involves two steps : ( i ) one calculates the operator product expansion ( ope ) series for a relevant correlator and obtains the sum rule which relates this ope to the sum over hadronic states , and ( ii ) one attempts to get rid of the contribution of the excited states to the sum and isolate the ground - state contribution , thus relating parameters of the ground state to parameters of qcd .",
    "constructing ope in qcd is a well - defined procedure , whereas the extraction of the ground - state contribution requires several assumptions which do not come from the underlying field theory ; it is hard to control the reliability of these assumptions and , as the consequence , the accuracy of the ground - state parameters extracted from sum rules .    in order to probe the reliability and the accuracy of standard procedures adopted in the method of sum rules in qcd ,",
    "quantum - mechanical model is an ideal tool : in this model one can exactly calculate direct analogues of the field - theory correlators , one can generate analogues of the ope for these correlators to any order , and , finally , one knows the exact bound - state parameters , such as masses , wave functions , and form factors .",
    "therefore , one can compare the outcome of the standard sum - rule calculation with the exact values and in this way obtain an `` unbiased '' probe of the reliability of the sum - rule calculation .    in the recent publications @xcite , the procedures of extracting ground - state parameters from two - point @xcite and three - point @xcite vacuum correlators were studied . in the present paper , a similar strategy",
    "is applied to vacuum - to - hadron correlator @xcite which is the basic object for the extraction of hadron form factors in the method of light - cone sum rules in qcd .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that fixing the effective continuum threshold for the case of vacuum - to - hadron correlator poses a challenging problem ( in fact more challenging problem than that for the case of the vacuum - to - vacuum correlators ) .",
    "in particular , the effective continuum threshold is found to differ sizeably from nearly constant effective continuum threshold for polarization operator and to depend strongly both on the momentum transfer and on the borel parameter .",
    "this leads to difficulties in finding a reasonable approximation to this quantity and , as the consequence , to large systematic uncertainties in sum - rule results for hadron form factors .",
    "we consider a non - relativistic model with ho potential @xmath0 the full green function @xmath1 and the free green function @xmath2 satisfy the equation @xmath3 which may be solved by constructing the expansion in powers of the interaction @xmath4 : @xmath5 in ho model all characteristics of the bound states are easily calculable , e.g. for the ground state one has @xmath6 the elastic form factor of the ground state @xmath7 is defined according to @xmath8 with the current operator given by the kernel @xmath9",

    "to apply the method of sum rules to hadron form factors in a wider range of @xmath24 , a different correlator is used  the vacuum - to - hadron amplitude of the t - product of two currents .",
    "the analogue of this quantity in quantum mechanics has the form @xmath25 or , after borelization , @xmath26 an obvious disadvantage of this correlator compared to the three - point function @xmath27 is the necessity to know the ground - state wave function for its calculation .",

    "is known explicitly .",
    "making use of this wave function ( [ e0 ] ) and the results for the green function in configuration space @xmath28 from @xcite , we obtain the exact analytic expression for @xmath29 in ho model : @xmath30 the function @xmath31 depends on two dimensionless variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the average energy for this correlator has a simple form @xmath34 it should be noticed that the properties of the correlator @xmath31 differ considerably from the properties of @xmath11 and @xmath22 : for instance , @xmath31 and the corresponding @xmath35 are finite at @xmath36 , whereas the correlators @xmath37 and @xmath27 diverge at small @xmath14 as @xmath38 .",
    "the energies , related to @xmath37 and @xmath27 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , diverge as @xmath41 .",
    "the ground - state contribution to the correlator reads @xmath42 leading to @xmath43 notice the following features :    \\(i ) at large @xmath14 , the ground state provides the dominant contribution to @xmath29 , similar to any other correlator : @xmath44 ( ii ) at small @xmath45 , the ground state dominates the correlator for all @xmath14 .",
    "this is a specific feature of @xmath29 which arises due to the choice of the initial state .",

    "[ plot : q=2 ] ) the exact effective threshold turns out to depend sizeably on @xmath14 in the `` window '' .",

    ", however its value is different from the values determined by both prescriptions a and b. as the result , the prescription a strongly underestimates the form factor , leading to @xmath71 , whereas the prescription b overestimates it , yielding @xmath72 .",
    "the lesson to be learnt from these two examples is clear  neither the recepy a or b can guarantee the extraction of the true form factor with a controlled accuracy : in `` good '' cases one of these prescriptions may work , in `` bad '' cases they fail .",

    "we studied the vacuum - to - hadron correlator @xmath31 in harmonic - oscillator model and analysed the procedure of extracting the ground - state form factor from this correlator using the procedures of the method of sum rules .",
