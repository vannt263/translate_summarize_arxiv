    "in @xcite halmos asked if two almost commuting self - adjoint matrices are necessarily close to two exactly commuting self - adjoint matrices . to make this question as interesting as possible we take `` almost '' and `` close '' to be uniform across all matrix sizes .",
    "the question was answered when lin proved in @xcite that indeed every pair of almost commuting self - adjoint matrices is always close to a pair of exactly commuting self - adjoint matrices .",
    "shortly thereafter friis and rrdam gave a short proof of lin s theorem in @xcite .    before lin s solution a lot of work went into investigating similar problems .",
    "davidson showed in @xcite that triples of almost commuting self - adjoint matrices need not be close to exactly commuting triples .",
    "voiculescu showed that pairs of almost commuting unitary matrices are not necessarily close to pairs of exactly commuting unitaries in @xcite .",
    "exel and the first named author gave a short proof of voiculescu s result in @xcite .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is that if @xmath0 are almost commuting unitaries then the winding number of the path in @xmath1 given by @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] measures the obstruction to @xmath3 being close to commuting unitaries .",
    "the winding number for a commuting pair is zero so the winding number also has to be zero for any pair that can be perturbed to a commuting pair .",
    "the winding number is also referred to as the bott index , a name that highlights its connection to @xmath4-theory .",
    "by @xcite an almost commuting commuting pair of unitary matrices @xmath0 is close to a commuting pair of unitary matrices if and only if the bott index of the pair is zero .",
    "so long as we measure noncommutativity via the operator norm , use complex scalars , do nt worry about algorithms or quantitative results , we can end here the story on almost commuting unitary matrices .",
    "the recent focus in condensed matter physics on systems with time - reversal and other anti - unitary symmetries , see for instance @xcite , resulted in a new chapter of this story to be written .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 in that arose in this context satisfied new relations @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath9 is either the transpose or the dual operation @xmath10 given by @xmath11    thus came an intense focus on symmetric unitary matrices and self - dual unitary matrices that almost commute . there arose an index , the pfaffian - bott index , that is linked to the spin chern number in certain two - dimensional topological insulators . building on the work in @xcite",
    ", we characterized when such pairs of almost commuting self - dual or symmetric unitaries can be perturbed to an exactly commuting pair in @xcite . from a physics point of view , this was a natural place to look .    in the present paper",
    "we continue the story in a different direction , by asking when a pair of almost commuting real - valued unitaries matrices , i.e. real orthogonal matrices , are close to exactly commuting real - valued unitaries . unlike in the complex case we find that a pair of almost commuting real orthogonals are always close to an exactly commuting pair . with very little extra work",
    ", we also get results for symplectic unitaries .    for a pair of real orthogonal matrices",
    "the winding number of the path ( [ windingnumberpath ] ) is always zero . by results from @xcite",
    "this means that close to any pair of almost commuting real orthogonal there is a pair of exactly commuting unitary ( though not necessarily real orthogonal ) matrices . unlike in the case of self - dual unitaries , it turns out that there is no new obstruction to finding real orthogonal approximates .",
    "thus , our main theorem is :    [ mainthm : perturbation ] for any @xmath12 there exists a @xmath13 such that whenever and @xmath0 are real orthogonal matrices in @xmath14 with @xmath15 there exist real orthogonal matrices @xmath16 such that @xmath17 the identical statement holds in the symplectic unitary case .",
    "following past work we will give a lifting solution to the perturbation problem . to properly state the relevant lifting problem",
    "we will use the theory of real @xmath18-algebras .",
    "we take the point of view that a real @xmath18-algebra is a @xmath18-algebra endowed with a map that acts like the transpose on matrices .",
    "we call such algebras @xmath19-algebras , and it is in the category of such algebras we prove lifting theorems .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the terminology introduced in @xcite .",
    "our main technical advance is theorem  [ thm : realextension ] which concerns the interplay of ideals and the real structure .",
    "when we have appropriate symmetry conditions theorem  [ thm : realextension ] allows us to invoke complex lifting results in the real case . this way we avoid real @xmath4-theory , and",
    "so our techniques can be used in a fairly broad context .",
    "what is critical is the absence of complex @xmath4-theoretic obstructions and that the underlying commuting situation corresponds to a two - dimensional cw complex with an involution that has only a zero- or one - dimensional set of fixed points .",
    "we prove theorem  [ mainthm : perturbation ] by studying the torus with a specific rotation ( see definition  [ def : rotationreflection ] ) .",
    "if we instead consider a disc with an involution that flips elements across the @xmath20-axis we obtain an additional real version of lin s theorem :    [ thm : lin s ] for any @xmath12 there exists a @xmath13 such that whenever @xmath21 is a real matrix in @xmath14 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 there exists a normal real matrix @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 the identical statement holds for quaternionic matrices .",
    "commutativity is just one relation for which we can examine the approximate version .",
    "we can also ask about almost anti - commuting unitary matrices , for example . both of these questions can be studied by looking at the class of @xmath27-algebras called noncommutive cw complexes ( nccw complexes ) .",
    "glossing over the technical details , the general story about nccw complexes and approximate relations in is as follow : if relations corresponds to a one- or two - dimensional nccw complex , then complex matrices that almost satisfy these relations can be perturbated to ones that exactly satisfy the relations , if and only if the invariants coming from the @xmath4-theory of the 2-cells vanish ( @xcite ) .    keeping the connection to physics in mind",
    "we might wish to define a real @xmath18-algebra version of nccw complexes and use them to study perturbation problems for matrices .",
    "the number of possible generalization here is surprisingly large .",
    "an example of a two - cell in an nccw complex is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the unit disc . to put an involution on this we replace @xmath30 with a simple , finite - dimensional @xmath19-algebra , so one of @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "if one prefers to think of real @xmath18-algebras not as @xmath18-algebras with extra structure , but as algebras over @xmath33 , then this is equivalent to choosing @xmath34 as our finite dimensional algebra .",
    "we must also put an involution on the disc and there are at least three options ; the fixed points can be a single point , a line , or the whole space .",
    "so even in this simple case , we are staring at @xmath35 generalizations .",
    "theorem  [ thm : lin s ] is a basic theorem about one of these generalized two - cells .",
    "more examples are needed to guide us safely forward .",
    "we believe that our techniques can be useful in a more general study of real nccw complexes , whatever the final definition , and while we chose our main theorems for their nice nice and easy statements in linear algebra , they can act as useful examples of the behavior we want real nccw complexes to display .",
    "denote by @xmath36 the two - torus and recall that @xmath37 is the universal @xmath18-algebra generated by two commuting unitaries .",
    "[ def : rotationreflection ] let @xmath9 be the unique reflection on @xmath37 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the universal unitaries generating @xmath37 .",
    "we call this reflection the _ the rotation reflection _     ]    the rotation reflection can be described topologically by thinking of the torus as the square with opposite sides identified .",
    "then the reflection is simply rotation around the center point by @xmath41 degrees , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : torus_tau ] .",
    "the lifting theorem we aim to prove is the following :    [ mainthm : lifting ] let @xmath42 be a sequence of natural numbers , and let @xmath9 be the rotation reflection on @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath43 denote either the transpose operation or the dual operation on matrices , the latter only allowed if all the @xmath44 are even .",
    "for every @xmath45-@xmath9-homomorphism @xmath46 there exists a @xmath45-@xmath9-homomorphism @xmath47 such that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the quotient map .",
    "the equivalence of theorem [ mainthm : perturbation ] and theorem [ mainthm : lifting ] is proved by well - known methods .",
    "our strategy for proving theorem [ mainthm : lifting ] follows the beaten path .",
    "first we will `` open up holes '' in the torus to produce an `` @xmath50-holed torus '' with involution , which then we will retract onto a one dimensional cw complex that looks like a grid , again with an involution .",
    "past works have had the advantage of knowing that the relevant one dimensional cw complex are semipropjective . in our case",
    ", we do not know that , so we proceed as friis and rrdam and `` open up holes '' in the grid , then we retract onto a finite set of points .",
    "now we can use semiprojectivity to solve our lifting problem .",
    "the aim of this section is to develop a method to move results on extending @xmath45-homomorphisms from the category of @xmath18-algebras to the category of @xmath19-algebras .",
    "our main tool will be the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : realextension ] let @xmath51 be a proper @xmath45-homomorphism .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath66 is proper then @xmath55 is proper .",
