    "the merrifield  simmons index and the hosoya index of a graph , respectively introduced by merrifield and simmons  @xcite and by hosoya  @xcite , are two prominent examples of topological indices for the study of the relation between molecular structure and physical / chemical properties of certain hydrocarbon compound , such as the correlation with boiling points  @xcite .",
    "independent _ set of vertices / edges of a graph @xmath0 is a set of which no two vertices of the set are connected by a single edge .",
    "the merrifield ",
    "simmons index is defined as the total number , denoted by @xmath1 , of independent vertex sets , while the hosoya index is defined as the total number of independent edge sets .",
    "especially , finding the merrifield ",
    "simmons index of graphs is known as the hard square problem in lattice statistics .",
    "one of important problems is to determine the extremal graphs with respect to these two indices within certain prescribed classes .",
    "for example , among trees with the same number of vertices , prodinger and tichy  @xcite proved that the star maximizes the merrifield ",
    "simmons index , while the path minimizes it .",
    "the situation for the hosoya index is absolutely opposite ; the star minimizes the hosoya index , while the path maximizes it  @xcite .",
    "a good summary of results for extremal graphs of various types can be found in a survey paper  @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred , however , to other articles @xcite that treat several classes of graphs such as fullerene graphs , trees with prescribed degree sequence , graphs with connectivity at most k and the generalized aztec diamonds .",
    "we also consider a bipartite vertex set @xmath2 in a graph @xmath0 in which some vertices of @xmath2 are colored black and the others are white .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is a _",
    "bipartite independent vertex set _ if the vertices of the same color are independent ( vertices with different colors may not be independent ) .",
    "the total number of bipartite independent vertex sets in @xmath0 will be called the bipartite merrifield  simmons index and denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "see the drawings in figure  [ fig : examples ] for exampels .",
    "recently several important enumeration problems on two - dimensional square lattice models have been solved by means of the _ state matrix recursion algorithm _ , developed by oh in  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm provides recursive matrix - relations to enumerate monomer and dimer coverings  @xcite , multiple self - avoiding walks and polygons  @xcite , and knot mosaics in quantum knot mosaic theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these recursive formulae also produce their generating functions . based upon these results ,",
    "this algorithm shows considerable promise for further two - dimensional lattice model enumerations .",
    "in this paper we use the state matrix recursion algorithm to calculate the merrifield ",
    "simmons index of the @xmath4 grid graph @xmath5 and further its bipartite merrifield ",
    "simmons index .",
    "consider the generating function of independent vertex sets ( ivss ) with variable @xmath6 in @xmath5 defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of ivss consisting of @xmath9 vertices . similarly consider the generating function for bipartite independent vertex sets ( bivss ) with variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of bivss consisting of @xmath14 white vertices and @xmath9 black vertices .",
    "we easily notice that @xmath15 .",
    "these indices of @xmath5 are then simply obtained by @xmath16    hereafter @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the square zero - matrices of dimensions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "as listed in table  [ tab : list ] , @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , is known as the two - dimensional fibonacci number in virtue of prodinger and tichy s use of the fibonacci number of graphs  @xcite .",
    "since this sequence grows in a quadratic exponential rate , we may consider the limits @xmath37 which are called the _ hard square constant _ and the _ bipartite hard square constant _ , respectively .",
    "the existence of the hard square constant was shown in  @xcite , and the most updated estimate @xmath38 appeared in  @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional application of the fekete s lemma gives another simple proof of the existence and mathematical lower and upper bounds for these constants .    [ thm : growth ] the double limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 exist .",

    "in this section we use the state matrix recursion algorithm to enumerate bipartite independent vertex sets .",

    "we reformulate the state matrix recursion algorithm by using seven mosaic tiles @xmath101 illustrated in figure  [ fig : tile2 ] .",
