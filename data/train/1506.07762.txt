    "atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was first achieved in 1995 @xcite , which inspired a massive worldwide research effort into investigating its properties . today , atomic becs",
    "are being considered for applications in a variety of fields , such as quantum simulation @xcite , quantum information @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become apparent that becs can be made in a variety of different systems . in particular , a bec of quasi - particle excitations in semiconductor systems consisting of exciton - polaritons",
    "have been observed @xcite .",
    "exciton - polariton becs are formed in semiconductor microcavities @xcite , or planar dielectric fabry - prot optical cavities @xcite , for example , and can be described as half - matter , half - light excitations that are typically created using laser injection methods @xcite .",
    "exciton - polariton becs are a non - equilibrium phenomenon that can be achieved at room temperatures for suitable materials that support the polaritons @xcite . in materials",
    "where polaritons can be operated at room temperature , interactions tend to be weaker , however more recently the nonlinearities have been observed to be significant @xcite . despite the non - equilibrium nature of the polariton bec",
    ", it shares many of the properties of an atomic bec , such as superfluidity , stable vortex formation , and high spatial coherence .",
    "although it is now commonplace to realize atomic becs , typically they need to be cooled to very low temperatures in the region of @xmath0 nk . even for high - temperature superconductors , which may be viewed as a type of charged condensation @xcite",
    ", the highest critical temperature attained has been @xmath1 k @xcite . on the other hand , exciton - polaritons ( or polaritons for simplicity ) typically have very high critical temperatures , due to their exceedingly light effective mass ( i.e. , @xmath2 times the bare electron mass ) .",
    "consequently , this opens the door for new quantum technologies based on room - temperature superfluidity ( i.e. , `` polaritonics '' ) @xcite , and avenues for novel light sources @xcite .",
    "one particular proposal based on becs that has gathered recent interest is the matter wave analogue of the sagnac interferometer , also called a `` quantum gyroscope . ''",
    "an intuitive way to view these are as a neutral species version of a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite .",
    "squids are well - known to be the most sensitive magnetometers , with capabilities of detecting small magnetic fields in the region of @xmath3 t @xcite . due to the close analogy of a magnetic field of a charged particle and rotation in the schrdinger equation",
    ", one may envision a device based on becs that is highly sensitive to rotations , instead of magnetic fields .",
    "for this reason , ultracold atomic gases have been considered to be an outstanding candidate physical system for realizing such a sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "one advantage that atomic systems possess is the exquisite experimental control that is achievable , particularly for creating vortices in becs @xcite .",
    "moreover , these ultracold atomic gases are highly coherent @xcite , meaning that they are particularly suited for interferometry . however , from a practical perspective , one of the drawbacks of technologies that utilize ultracold atomic gases is that in order to achieve bec , experimental conditions need to be cooled to nanokelvin temperatures .",
    "this can prove quite expensive , and difficult to achieve in a compact device design . in order to overcome this challenge ,",
    "a natural extension of the idea is to use exciton - polariton becs @xcite , which may condense at room temperatures @xcite .",
    "this offers a potential new configuration for achieving a novel sagnac interferometer @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail the possibility of such a `` polariton quantum gyroscope . ''",
    "the type of novel measurement configuration investigated herein has the potential for providing a highly compact and stable sagnac interferometer @xcite , which can also be used as a seismometer , for example .",
    "future applications of quantum gyroscopes include the detection of earthquakes @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite , sidereal time @xcite , inertial sensing @xcite capabilities , and even the rotational rate of our universe @xcite",
    ".    such an exciton - polariton gyroscope would be a hybrid optical - matter wave sagnac interferometer @xcite , as polaritons themselves consist of both photons and excitons . in our scheme , one of the necessary ingredients for",
    "this interferometer will be the optical excitation of vortices @xcite in the polariton bec .",
    "the direct excitation of vortices by optical means is a convenient way of producing the required vortex superposition state in the condensate , as techniques to generate the optical counterparts are well - established . here",
    ", it should be pointed out that the counter - rotating vortex superpositon state differs from the vortex - antivortex pair such as those observed in ref .",
    "the investigation of various vortex states in polariton becs has continued to gain much interest , with several works examining disorder - induced vortices @xcite , vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite , and vortex ring creation via rotation of gaussian laser beams @xcite , to name a few .",
    "one of the most efficient methods of vortex creation is using laguerre - gauss optical states which carry a well - defined external orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite .",
    "however , for sagnac interferometry , a superposition of a vortex and an antivortex is required , which has not been achieved in polariton becs to date to our knowledge .",
    "while the vortex - antivortex superposition has been achieved in atomic systems @xcite , this remains an outstanding problem for polaritons , and is interesting from both a fundamental and applications perspective .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the prospects of angular momentum superposition states in exciton - polariton becs for potential applications in sagnac interferometry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : imprint ] we present and analyze a scheme for generating vortex - antivortex superpositions via coherent excitation with oam states of light . in the scheme , the polariton bec is initially seeded with the desired oam superposition , then allowed to evolve freely via the open - dissipative gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this allows for the polaritons to approach their own dynamical equilibrium state , independent of the initial state of light .",
    "we then study methods to improve the sensitivities of the polariton bec gyroscope in sec .",

    "this light is passed through a spiral phase plate ( spp ) , generating an orbital angular momentum ( oam ) state of light .",
    "once the oam state of light has traveled through the mach - zehnder interferometer with a dove prism ( dp ) and mirrors ( m ) , an oam superposition state of light is made .",
    "the resulting oam superposition state of light can be used to generate an interference pattern in a polariton bec matter wave within the distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) microcavity .",
    "this interference pattern is imaged by a detector such as a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) , and can then be used to determine the sagnac phase and therefore the rotational rate of the polariton bec . ]",
    "we first describe how the vortex - antivortex superposition is created in the exciton - polariton bec . the experimental setup for the creation of a vortex - antivortex polariton bec is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is similar to the traditional optical ( i.e. , mach - zehnder ) sagnac interferometer . unlike the traditional mach - zehnder scheme ,",
    "our polariton bec interferometer is based on a principle that employs oam superposition states of light .",
    "our starting point is a source of oam states of light , which can readily be produced by established methods , for example , by using spiral phase plates ( spps ) .",
    "this may be used to create oam superpositions , which coherently excite the polaritons in a dbr structure ( e.g. , semiconductor ) .",
    "this produces the initial seed polariton condensate , from which the polariton bec is reinforced by the standard process of exciton - polariton cooling and scattering .",
    "let us denote the bosonic annihilation operator for an oam mode with angular momentum number @xmath4 and radial node number @xmath5 as @xmath6 ( see appendix [ sec : app ] for more details ) .",
    "then the superposition state for the mode that we require is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 lobes ) has been transfered to the polariton bec , the sagnac phase can then be determined from the angular velocity of the bec cloud .",
    "we can obtain an ordinary vortex state here simply by setting either @xmath9 or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "many lasers emit light beams which approximate a gaussian profile with @xmath11 . using the tem@xmath12 fundamental transverse mode of the optical resonator and channeling it through a spp , for example ,",
    "can be used to generate oam states of light ( see appendix [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "although these states are generally made with holographs , spps offer a simple and convenient way to obtain a pure oam state @xmath6 with arbitrary integer @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , once the pure state @xmath6 has been obtained , we can generate an oam superposition state .",
    "one way to accomplish this is by using a mach - zehnder type of configuration as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the dove prism is used to transform the @xmath6 state into a @xmath14 state to obtain @xmath15 at the real output of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "if desired , one may choose the first beam splitter as an @xmath16:@xmath17 beam splitter , and the second one as a 50:50 beam splitter to obtain an arbitrary superposition of the type @xmath7 .",
    "let us now consider the specific case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the two inputs of the first beam splitter are prepared in a coherent state in the lg mode @xmath6 and the vacuum state respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath18 assuming that the first beam splitter being used is a symmetric 50:50 beam splitter , the oam state of light has transformed like @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the lg modes in the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "the phase shift in the upper arm of the mach - zehnder interferometer will cause the coherent amplitude to replaced by @xmath21 , and the dove prism in the lower arm of the mach - zehnder interferometer will cause the coherent amplitude to be replaced by @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the oam state of light seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) becomes @xmath23 finally , neglecting the imaginary output of the interferometer , the second beam splitter reverses the transformation and produces the oam superposition state of light , written as @xmath24 which is our desired output .",
    "the superposition of @xmath6 and @xmath14 states in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) can be detected using many different techniques , which typically includes imaging the interference pattern of the light beams which constitute the oam superposition state .",
    "in particular once the polariton bec is induced , one may use standard spatial and momentum space imaging methods to analyze the coherent condensate state in the polariton microcavity @xcite .",
    "the laser injection methods of the previous section can be used to resonantly excite the polariton bec .",
    "the phase of the light is directly imprinted on the polariton bec system , hence the injected polaritons simply follow the same phase relation as the injected light . in this configuration alone , there is no difference of using the oam superposition states of light to the polariton bec , as the polaritons inherit their vortex nature from the light .",
    "however , once the initial coherent excitation is induced , the oam superposition is turned off , and the microcavity system is excited by conventional polariton pumping .",
    "this can be performed by an off - resonant pumping where the excitons have a much higher energy than the polaritons , or by pumping at a high in - plane momenta ( see figure 1b in ref .",
    "either method creates a large population of uncondensed polaritons from which the polariton bec is replenished .",
    "it is important to note that apart form the initial seed polariton bec which is induced coherently , the remaining population thereafter is not pumped with the oam superposition state .",
    "hence in the second phase where the conventional polariton bec pumping is used , any oam superposition state is a genuine steady state of the polariton bec , and possesses its own dynamics .    while both vortices and vortex - antivortex pairs have been shown theoretically and experimentally to be stable configurations of polariton becs @xcite , whether or not a counter - rotating vortex superposition is a stable configuration is a non - trivial problem .",
    "such vortex - antivortex superpositions have a more complex phase relation than standard vortex configurations , and have the possibility to spontaneously separate spatially , or relax to a zero momentum state .",
    "to investigate this , we have studied the vortex - antivortex superposition in a variety of different circumstances to evaluate its stability .",
    "the spatiotemporal evolution of the non - equilibrium exciton - polariton system is described by the open - dissipative gross - pitaevskii ( dgp ) equation , expressed as @xcite @xmath25 % \\psi ( \\mathbf{x},t ) ,   \\label{eq17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a complex valued condensate order parameter , @xmath27 is the polariton - polariton interaction constant , @xmath28 is the polariton mass , @xmath29 is a spatially dependent trapping potential energy ( see figure 5 in ref .",

    "we will assume that the time scale is in units of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the length scale set by the experiment ( e.g. , size of trapping potential or pump spot diameter ) .",
    "we use the generalized finite - difference time - domain ( g - fdtd ) scheme to solve the dgp equation .",
    "g - fdtd is an explicit method that permits an accurate solution with simple computation for solving eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) in multiple dimensions . to this end ,",
    "the function @xmath35 is first split into real and imaginary components resulting in two coupled equations .",
    "the real and imaginary components are then approximated using higher - order taylor series expansions in time , where the derivatives in time are then substituted into the derivatives in space via the coupled equations .",
    "finally , the derivatives in space are approximated using higher - order finite difference methods .",

    "the system quickly reaches steady state and little change is seen beyond @xmath49 . the stability of the counter - rotating vortex - antivortex superposition can be attributed to the same reason as for atomic becs : both the vortex and antivortex require a density defect due to the phase velocity diverging at the vortex core .",

    "[ sec : exp ] , the pumping profile @xmath85 does not contain any phase information , hence can not impose any particular phase on the condensate .",

    "another strategy that can be used to enhance the sensitivity is via the use of periodic potentials on the underlying dbr lattice .",

    "the stronger the potential that is applied , the flatter the dispersion becomes .",
    "this originates from the fact that the kinetic energy is suppressed due to the reduced tunneling between adjacent sites .",
    "flatter bands result in a larger effective mass of the particles . as the de broglie wavelength of the particles is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the velocity of the particle , a large mass gives a shorter wavelength , and thus increased sensitivities .    a more direct physical argument which shows the increased sensitivity",

    "thus in a periodic potential with counter - propagating modes the interference pattern is @xmath92 , the periodic potential thus gives a finer periodicity than the @xmath78 modes . by detecting shifts in the finer fringes",

    "optical mach - zehnder interferometers @xcite are typically capable of achieving an excellent rotational measurement sensitivity , thanks to the large area that the interferometric loop circumscribes @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "atomic matter wave interferometers typically have small loop areas and short - time rotational sensitivities @xcite .",
    "however , matter wave interferometers have the advantage that their de broglie wavelength is much shorter than the optical counterparts . for atomic becs",
    ", this makes the rotational measurement sensitivity of atomic matter wave interferometers per unit area exceed that of optical ones by the ratio @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "typically polariton masses are extremely insignificant ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) , where @xmath106 is the bare electron mass .",
    "this almost entirely negates the advantage of polaritons to @xmath107 , which is the same level as photons .",
    "this is not surprising as polaritons themselves are part - matter , part - photon quasiparticles , hence much of their characteristics are inherited from light . in terms of sensitivity , polaritons would appear to be ill - suited for such gyroscopic applications .",
    "we argue below that for counter - rotating vortex superposition based interferometers this argument does not directly apply , as the sagnac phase is independent of the de broglie wavelength .",
    "let us first review the state - of - the - art optical sagnac interferometers . typically , in an optical interferometer , light of wavelength @xmath108 propagates in a closed loop .",
    "for each completed propagation in the closed loop configuration , such as in a fiber optic gyroscope , the sagnac phase is given by @xmath109 where the @xmath110 is the wavelength of the light , @xmath111 is the angular ( rotational ) velocity , @xmath112 is the speed of light , and @xmath113 is the area of the mach - zender interferometer . in a ring laser gyroscope ,",
    "the quantity that is measured is the beat frequency of two counterpropagating lasers . in terms of the phase difference , this is now a time - evolving quantity of the form @xmath114 where @xmath5 is the perimeter of the interferometric loop .",
    "the fiber optic gyroscope and the ring laser gyroscope phases differ in operation in that the latter is time dependent , while the former is not .",
    "this means that as the system rotates , the fiber optic gyroscope produces a shift in the fringes only when there is a rotation @xmath115 , while the ring laser gyroscope detects the total time - varying phase of the rotation .",
    "therefore the longer one waits between comparisons of the interference fringes , the larger the angle difference , and therefore the sensitivity .    in both types of optical gyroscopes ,",
    "the phase is proportional to the area of the interferometric loop .",
    "this is quite different to the situation in a bec where the phase around a vortex is fixed purely by the topological winding number .",
    "thus independent of the path , a phase of @xmath116 is picked up around a vortex . for a fixed @xmath4 ,",
    "the path can in principle enclose an arbitrary area and yet will not pick up any additional phase .",
    "it is also independent of the de broglie wavelength @xmath117 for the same reasons .",
    "therefore , _ for a counter - rotating vortex - antivortex superposition , the sagnac phase is independent of the area of the bec and the mass of the particles ( i.e. , polaritons ) involved_. as the sagnac phase directly originates from the interference of two counter - rotating angular momentum , it follows that the the sagnac phase can then be written as @xmath118 and can be determined from the @xmath111 of the vortex superposition state in a polariton bec .",
    "is it possible to regain the geometry and wavelength dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) in a bec to further improve the sensitivity ? for the ring geometry considered in sec . [ sec : meta ] the area and wavelength dependence is reinstated , as we show below . for the bec case",
    "the sagnac phase for polaritons can be written @xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of times a polariton revolves around the loop in a time @xmath121 . in a ring geometry of radius @xmath122 as seen in @xcite , we have for counter - propagating momenta @xmath78 @xmath123 this therefore gives @xmath124 we note here that each polariton in the bec cloud has the same magnitude of the angular momentum , which contributes to the signal - to - noise ratio as will be discussed below .",
    "the relation now has a boost in the sensitivity with the radius of the ring , which arises from the fact that the velocity of a wave with momentum @xmath93 has a value @xmath125 .",
    "this is in contrast to a vortex which decays with radius @xmath126 .    in the ring geometry",
    "we regain the enhancement due to the de broglie wavelength in eq .",
    "( [ ringphi ] ) , as for heavy particles , the typical wavenumber @xmath127 is much higher , which also results in enhanced sensitivities . in this sense , the use of periodic potentials as discussed in the previous section can aid the sensitivity , as this produces effectively larger effective masses , and hence larger typical @xmath93 .",
    "we note that on setting @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , eq . ( [ ringphi ] ) reduces to eq .",

    ", one may determine the angular velocity @xmath111 from the density profile of the polariton bec .",
    "the condensate density will show an interference pattern determined by the phase difference between the amplitudes and charges of the two vortex components , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig3old ] - [ fig : ring ] .",
    "this allows the polariton bec to be used for the measurement of changes in the sagnac phase caused by the rotation of the laboratory frame of reference ( i.e. , the interferometer itself ) .",
    "this can be performed using existing experimental techniques where a ccd camera is used to image the photoluminescence from the polariton bec .",
    "determining the sagnac phase using our proposed polariton sagnac interferometer will depend on the vortex charge @xmath13 of the polariton bec superposition state . in practice ,",
    "spiral phase plates ( spps ) generally work best for low integer values of @xmath13 .",
    "however , in principle , @xmath13 can take on any integer value , although low integer values of @xmath13 generally give a more stable vortex superposition .",
    "the proposed polariton sagnac interferometer is based on imaging the standing wave of the polariton bec , which is comparably much smaller than the area occupied by comparable optical technologies ( e.g. , ring - laser gyroscope ) .",
    "thus the polariton ring geometry has the potential for higher sensitivities .",
    "we are now in a position to compare the rotational phases per particle of the interference patterns @xmath133 . due to the similar nature of the operation , it is simplest to compare the polariton gyroscopes to the ring laser gyroscope , which both have an increasing sagnac phase in the time domain . for the ring laser gyroscope ,",
    "taking @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and typical optical wavelengths , one obtains the proportionality of @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ ringlaser ] ) to be @xmath137 . for ultracold atom implementations , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and velocities",
    "@xmath140 we have @xmath141 @xcite . for the polariton gyroscope with ring radii of @xmath142 m and @xmath143 @xcite ,",
    "this gives the coefficient of the rotational phase in eq .",
    "( [ ringphi ] ) as @xmath144 .",
    "thus in terms of the best achievable sensitivities per particle , polariton gyroscopes appear to have a large handicap compared to other methods due to their long wavelengths and relatively small interferometric loop areas .",
    "however , we shall see in the next section that some of this deficit is made up by the superior signal - to - noise of polaritons .",
    "we now discuss the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the sensitivity achievable in such a polariton sagnac interferometer .",
    "the snr is given by the ratio of the rotational phase shift to the shot - noise that depends on the number of photons @xmath145 arriving at the ccd from the polariton condensate per second @xcite @xmath146 the final snr has a maximum at a certain rate of photon detection , and the sensitivity @xmath147 is calculated by setting snr@xmath148 .",
    "thus , for the superposition in the geometries as seen in figs . [ fig3old ] - [ fig5 ] , @xmath149 and for the vortex - antivortex superposition in the ring geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] we have @xmath150 typical polariton densities are in the region of @xmath151 @xmath152 , and a polariton spot size of @xmath153 @xmath154m@xmath155 gives a polariton number in the region of @xmath156 .",
    "the lifetime of the polaritons is in the region of @xmath157 ps , hence we can estimate that the number of signal photons is @xmath158 for polaritons .",
    "this gives our estimate for the polariton vortex - antivortex superposition in the ring geometry @xmath159 this is comparable with state - of - the - art atomic beam gyroscopes which are at the @xmath160 level @xcite .    with regard to the stability of our proposed polariton sagnac interferometer , it bypasses the beam drift that is a common cause of instability in the metrology that employs atomic or optical beams , and no complicated atomic beam configurations are required .",
    "the technical issues that optical sagnac interferometers face , such as the short - time rotational sensitivity problem @xcite , and the change in phase velocity of light @xcite , should not be present for polaritons by construction .",
    "moreover , thermal expansion over atomic beam trajectories is not an issue for a polariton bec , as atomic beams are not needed .",
    "interferometers which use atomic beams usually have beam drifts on the order of @xmath161 after hours of running time @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of our scheme ( i.e. , no large optical loops in a solid state device ) , would suggest that our scheme should not suffer as seriously from stability issues .",
    "we note that for purposes of seismometry , since the vector of angular velocity @xmath162 is proportional to the vector of ground velocity @xmath163 @xmath164 in this sense a quantum polariton seismometer can detect the ground velocity from the sagnac phase by detecting rotations that originate from unaccounted rotations of the ground .",
    "in this study , we have introduced two schemes for inducing counter - rotating vortex superposition states in a polariton bec for gyroscopy .",
    "the first is via direct injection of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light through a distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) microcavity .",
    "once the vortex superposition state is induced , it follows a free evolution under standard pump - loss dynamics of the polariton bec .",
    "the second is via metastable condensation in periodic lattices , where particular momentum modes are reinforced by using pumping profiles with the target periodicity . by directly numerically simulating the dynamics",
    ", we found that the vortex - antivortex superposition state is stable under a variety of different conditions ; in smooth , disordered , and periodic potentials . in all cases we found that the vortex superposition state is stable and is long - lived .",
    "we investigated the possibility that the superposition of counter - rotating currents in the polariton bec can be used as a method for determining the sagnac phase  and thus the angular velocity of the interferometer  effectively constituting a `` quantum gyroscope . ''",
    "the vortex - antivortex superposition has the same sagnac phase dependence as atomic becs , as the phase relation around a vortex is topologically fixed , regardless of the particle mass or the area of the bec .",
    "optical sagnac interferometers have large sensitivities by increasing the area of the interference loop , and atomic sagnac interferometers have an advantage due to their small de broglie wavelength . in this respect ,",
    "polariton gyroscopes have relatively small loop areas and long wavelengths .",
    "this can be enhanced using ring geometries or periodic potentials . in comparison with current technology",
    "it would appear that on a per polariton basis atomic and optical interferometers have a larger sensitivity .",
    "however , the polaritons do possess the great advantage that their signal - to - noise ratio should be considerably larger than that of atomic becs . in an atomic bec",
    "the optical measurement has the limitation that it should not disturb the system @xcite , hence there are restrictions on how bright the probe light should be . in contrast , for polaritons they are themselves part light , hence illumination by laser light is intrinsic to the condensation process .",
    "thus while the phase dependence of the polariton sagnac interferometer starts with several orders of magnitude deficit , the final estimated sensitivity is competitive with existing methods .",
    "polariton bec based gyroscopes have the additional practical advantage to atomic becs that they should lead to compact and room temperature compatible devices , as it is based on semiconductor technology .",
    "this could lead to a device with the desirable characteristics of compact operation with very high sensitivity and stability .",
    "for the metastable condensation technique , the ability of electrical injection of the condensate would remove the need for optics entirely , simplifying the device further . due to the limitations in the size of the polariton condensate ,",
    "they are naturally suited towards small volume applications .",
    "the effective mass of the polaritons can be tuned by engineering periodic structures , and conventional methods such as changing the exciton fraction of the polaritons , which give additional boosts to sensitivity .",
