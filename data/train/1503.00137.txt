    "networks have been used to represent the organization of complex systems , such as social networks , internet , and ecosystems @xcite .",
    "depending on the application , vertices and edges have different meanings @xcite .",
    "for example , in condensed matter physics , vertices and edges of the ordered network known as anderson s tight - binding model are the sites and hopping integrals , respectively @xcite .",
    "networks can be deterministic , fractal , or random @xcite .",
    "deterministic and fractal networks are constructed following specific rules , whereas for random networks a set of parameters take fixed values but the network itself has a random organization . in this later case",
    "it is meaningless to study a single random network , instead a statistical analysis of an ensemble of networks with the same average properties should be performed .",
    "several models of random networks have been introduced @xcite , including erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs , the scale - free network model of barabsi and albert , and the small - world networks of watts and strogatz .",
    "these models are considered to reproduce the organization of real - world networks , such as the internet , power - grids , and social and biological networks @xcite .",
    "although random graphs fail in predicting most of the properties observed in real - world networks , such as power - law degree distributions and nonvanishing clustering coefficient @xcite , such graphs have been deeply studied theoretically ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , many results , such as the emergence of percolation , can be obtained analytically in er networks @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the er random graph model , which was introduced by solomonoff and rapoport @xcite and deeply studied later by erds and rnyi @xcite .",
    "this model is also known as uncorrelated random graph model .",
    "er networks are constructed by starting with @xmath3 isolated vertices and afterwards , each pair of vertices is connected according to a probability @xmath2 .",
    "this process is a type of @xmath6-realizations bernoulli process with probability of success @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the number of connections follows a binomial distribution .",
    "nevertheless , most realizations of this model take into account large values of @xmath3 and small values of @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", the degree distribution tends to a poisson distribution due to the law of rare events .    independently of the field , classification , or application ,",
    "a commonly accepted mathematical representation of a network is the adjacency matrix .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath7 of a simple network , i.e. a network having no multiple edges or self - edges , is the matrix with elements @xmath8 defined as @xcite @xmath9 this prescription produces @xmath10 symmetric sparse matrices with zero diagonal elements , where @xmath3 is the number of vertices of the corresponding network .",
    "the sparsity of @xmath7 is quantified by the parameter @xmath2 which is the fraction of non - vanishing off - diagonal adjacency matrix elements .",
    "vertices are isolated when @xmath4 , whereas the network is fully connected for @xmath5 .",
    "once the adjacency matrix of a network is constructed , it is quite natural to ask about its spectral and eigenfunction properties , which is the main subject of this paper . as commonly used , we refer to the spectral and eigenfunction properties of the adjacency matrix as the spectral and eigenfunction properties of the respective network .",
    "moreover , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the adjacency matrix @xmath7 and the hamiltonian matrix @xmath11 of a @xmath12-dimensional solid , described by anderson s tight - binding model @xcite with zero on - site potentials ( @xmath13 ) and constant hopping integrals ( @xmath14 ) . here",
    "@xmath12 is proportional to the average non - zero off - diagonal adjacency matrix elements per matrix row and , therefore , may be regarded as the effective dimension of the network represented by @xmath7 ; as discussed in @xcite from a random matrix theory ( rmt ) point of view .",
    "this correspondence enables the direct application of studies originally motivated on physical systems , represented by hamiltonian sparse random matrices , to complex networks . in the network literature",
    ", @xmath12 is known as the average degree of a network . moreover ,",
    "notice that @xmath15 where @xmath12 was defined as the mean number of nonzero elements per matrix row . from a mathematical - physicist point of view , in the frame of rmt , in 1988 rodgers and bray @xcite proposed an ensemble of sparse random matrices characterized by the connectivity @xmath12 . since then , several papers have been devoted to analytical and numerical studies of sparse symmetric random matrices ( see for example @xcite ) .    among the most relevant results of these studies we can mention that : ( i ) in the very sparse limit , @xmath16 , the density of states was found to deviate from the wigner semicircle law with the appearance of singularities , around and at the band center , and tails beyond the semicircle @xcite ; ( ii ) a delocalization transition was found at @xmath17 @xcite ; ( iii ) the nearest - neighbor energy level spacing distribution @xmath0 was found to evolve from the poisson to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) predictions for increasing @xmath12 @xcite ( the same transition was reported for the number variance in ref .",
    "more recently , the first eigenvalue / eigenfunction problem was also addressed in ref .",
    "also , non - hermitian sparse matrices were approached in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is relevant to emphasize that the rmt model of sparse matrices introduced by rodgers and bray @xcite is equivalent to adjacency matrices of er  type networks .",
    "in fact , motivated by this equivalency and based on the er model , here we study spectral and eigenfunction properties of the following random network model : starting with the _ standard _ er network , we add to it self - edges and further consider all edges to have random strengths @xcite .",
    "we call this model as the er _ fully _ random network model . the sparsity @xmath2 is defined as the fraction of the @xmath18 independent non - vanishing off - diagonal adjacency matrix elements",
    ". then , as in the _ standard _ er model , the er _ fully _ random network model is characterized only by the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . however , the corresponding adjacency matrices come from the ensemble of @xmath10 sparse real symmetric matrices whose non - vanishing elements are statistically independent random variables drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean @xmath19 and variance @xmath20 . according to this definition a diagonal random matrix",
    "is obtained for @xmath4 ( poisson case ) , whereas the goe is recovered when @xmath5 .",
    "our motivation to study spectral and eigenfunction properties of the er _ fully _ random network model is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "jackson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the disorder parameter @xmath12 fixes some spectral features of sparse random matrices equivalent to the adjacency matrices we study here .",
    "moreover , it is also known that the average degree @xmath12 fixes some properties of random graphs @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a large number of papers studying spectral and eigenfunction properties of complex networks @xcite .",
    "however , most of those studies focus on networks with specific combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . for instance refs .",
    "@xcite investigated random networks using concepts of rmt centering the attention on networks with fixed @xmath3 and @xmath2 , even when more sophisticated topological properties are included in the network models , such as non - vanishing clustering coefficient  @xcite and modular structure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , palla and vallay  @xcite investigated spectral properties of _ standard _ er networks close to the critical point of percolation restricting the analysis to values of @xmath21 .",
    "then , we realized that the universality ( in the sense of identifying relevant network parameters ) of the spectral and eigenfunction properties of er  type random networks has not been completely explored yet .",
    "thus , in this paper we undertake this task having as a reference rmt models and predictions .",
    "furthermore , our investigations generalize previous results in the literature by not restricting our analysis to a specific combination of network parameters or even to a specific network model .    in the next section",
    "we analyze @xmath0 , i.e. the nearest - neighbor energy level spacing distribution , the average shannon entropy @xmath22 , and the entropic eigenfunction localization length @xmath23 for the er _ fully _ random network model as a function of the connectivity @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 , the probability distribution function of the spacings between adjacent eigenvalues , plays a prominent role in the description of disordered and quantized classically - chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "we show that @xmath0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are all invariant for fixed average degree @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we show that brody distribution fits well @xmath0 in the transition from isolated to fully connected networks . by noticing that the er _ fully _ random network model displays maximal disorder , in sect .",
    "iii we explore the validity of our findings when relaxing the randomness of this network model .",
    "therefore we show that the er network model with _ diagonal disorder _",
    "( i.e. er model including random strength self - edges ) also exhibits universality for fixed @xmath12 .",
    "we also apply our approach to a different random network model , so in sect .",
    "iv we comment on the spectral and eigenfunction properties of small - world random networks .",
    "our conclusions are developed in sect .",
    "in the following we use exact numerical diagonalization to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath24 and eigenfunctions @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) of the adjacency matrices of large ensembles of random networks characterized by @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the nearest - neighbor energy level spacing distribution @xmath0 for the adjacency matrices of er _ fully _ random networks of size @xmath27 and different connectivity values @xmath2 .",
    "the histograms were constructed by the use of the 500 unfolded spacings @xcite , @xmath28 , around the band center of @xmath29 random matrices . here , @xmath30 is the mean level spacing computed for each adjacency matrix as the slope of the curve @xmath24 vs.  @xmath31 around the band center .",
    "when other network sizes are considered , we always construct @xmath0 from half of the total eigenvalues around the band center , where the density of states is approximately constant .    for @xmath4 , i.e. when the vertices in the network are isolated , the corresponding adjacency matrices are diagonal and @xmath0 follows the exponential distribution , @xmath32 better known in rmt as poisson distribution or the spacing rule for random levels @xcite . in the opposite limit , @xmath5 , when the network is fully connected , the adjacency matrices become members of the goe ( full real symmetric random matrices ) and @xmath0 closely follows the wigner - dyson distribution  @xcite , @xmath33 then , by increasing @xmath2 from zero to one , the shape of @xmath0 should evolve from the poisson to the wigner - dyson distributions .",
    "this transition , partially observed for our random network model in refs .",
    "@xcite from a pure rmt point of view , is well depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we also plot eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ wd ] ) as reference .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to mention that for relatively small values of @xmath2 the limiting goe statistics is recovered .",
    "the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson in the spectral statistics has also been reported for adjacency matrices corresponding to other complex network models in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here , in order to characterize the shape of @xmath0 for our random networks we use the brody distribution @xcite which was originally derived to provide an interpolation expression for @xmath0 in the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson distributions by making the ansatz @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 depending on @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , after proper normalization brody distribution reads @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38^{\\beta+1}$ ] , @xmath39 is the gamma function , and @xmath36 , known as brody parameter , takes values in the range @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 reproduce the poisson and wigner - dyson distributions , respectively .",
    "we want to remark that , even though brody distribution has been extensively used to characterize @xmath0 having fractional power - law level repulsion @xcite , it has been obtained through a purely phenomenological approach and the brody parameter has no decisive physical meaning @xcite but serves as a measure for the degree of mixing between the poisson and goe statistics .",
    "in particular , as we show below , the brody parameter will allows us to identify the onset of the delocalization transition and the onset of the goe limit in our random network models .    black dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represent the fittings of the numerically obtained @xmath0 with eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath36 are given in the corresponding panels .",
    "this figure shows that brody distribution provides very good fittings for the @xmath0 of the adjacency matrices of er _ fully _ random networks .",
    "in fact , brody distribution also works well for other complex networks models @xcite .     for er _",
    "fully _ random networks of size @xmath27 and different connectivity values @xmath2 ( red histograms ) .",
    "blue lines correspond to poisson and wigner - dyson distribution functions given by eqs .",

    "now we also construct histograms of @xmath0 for a large number of values of @xmath2 to extract systematically the corresponding values of @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) reports @xmath36 versus @xmath2 for five different network sizes . notice that in all five cases the behavior of @xmath36 is similar : @xmath36 shows a smooth transition from zero ( poisson regime ) to one ( wigner - dyson or goe regime ) when @xmath2 increases from @xmath48 ( mostly isolated vertices ) to one ( fully connected networks ) .",
    "notice also that the larger the network size @xmath3 , the smaller the value of @xmath2 needed to approach the goe limit .",
    "this is , in fact , the reason we observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that @xmath0 is very close to the wigner - dyson distribution already for @xmath49 .     for er _ fully _ random networks of sizes ranging from @xmath45 to 4000 and different values of the average degree @xmath12 ( color histograms ) .",

    "we recall that the parameter @xmath12 ( see eq .  ( [ xi ] ) ) fixes the density of states of sparse random matrices  @xcite equivalent to the density of connections in the adjacency matrices we study here .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 was defined as the effective dimension of the sparse random matrix model  @xcite . also , martnez - mendoza et al .",
    "@xcite showed that scattering and transport properties of tight - binding er _ fully _ random networks are universal for fixed disorder parameter @xmath12 .",
    "thus , it make sense to explore the dependence of @xmath36 on the average degree @xmath12 ; in fact , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we show this dependency .",
    "we observe that curves for different network sizes @xmath3 fall on top of a universal curve .",
    "this means that once @xmath12 is fixed , no matter the network size , the shape of @xmath0 is also fixed .",
    "we also note that the transition in the form of @xmath0 takes place in the interval @xmath54 ; i.e. when @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath0 has the poisson ( wigner - dyson ) shape .",
    "therefore , we verify the invariance of the form of @xmath0 for fixed average degree @xmath12 by ( i ) choosing four representative values of @xmath36 ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and @xmath57 ) ; ( ii ) extracting the corresponding values of @xmath12 from the universal curve of fig .  [ fig2](b ) ; and ( iii ) constructing histograms of @xmath0 for several network sizes for each of the chosen values of @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that once @xmath12 is fixed , the form of @xmath0 is invariant .",
    "in addition , we include in each panel the corresponding brody distributions .",

    "[ fig2](b ) also provides a way to predict the shape of @xmath0 of er _ fully _ random networks once the average degree @xmath12 is known : when @xmath58 , @xmath0 has the poisson shape . for @xmath59 , @xmath0",
    "is practically given by the wigner - dyson distribution .",
    "while in the regime @xmath60 , @xmath0 is well described by brody distributions characterized by a value of @xmath61 .",

    "are mostly used : ( i ) the information or shannon entropy and ( ii ) the eigenfunction participation number .",
    "these measures provide the number of principal components of an eigenfunction in a given basis .",

    "we average over all eigenfunctions of an ensemble of adjacency matrices of size @xmath3 to compute @xmath22  @xcite . with this definition ,",
    "when @xmath4 , since the eigenfunctions of the adjacency matrices of our random network model have only one non - vanishing component with magnitude equal to one , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath5 , @xmath68 and the fully chaotic eigenfunctions extend over the @xmath3 available vertices in the network , i.e. @xmath69 .    figures  [ fig4](a ) and [ fig5](a ) show @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , as a function of the connectivity @xmath2 for the adjacency matrices of er _ fully _ random networks of sizes @xmath52 , 1000 , 2000 , and 4000 .",
    "we observe that the curves @xmath70 and @xmath71 have the same functional form as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "notice that this behavior is also observed for @xmath36 in fig .",

    "when we plot @xmath70 and @xmath71 as a function of the average degree @xmath12 , we observe the coalescence of all curves into universal ones ( see figs .  [",
    "fig4](b ) and [ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , note that the point at which every er _ fully _ random network becomes globally connected ( in the sense that it does not contain isolated sub - networks ) , @xmath72 @xcite , occurs when @xmath73 ( see the dashed vertical lines in fig .  [ fig5](a ) ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) it is clear that the universal behavior of the curve @xmath71 as a function of the average degree @xmath12 can be easily described : ( i ) @xmath71 transits from @xmath74 to one by moving @xmath12 from zero to @xmath3 ; ( ii ) for @xmath75 the eigenfunctions are practically localized since @xmath76 ; hence the delocalization transition takes place around @xmath77 , which is close to previous theoretical and numerical estimations @xcite ; and ( iii ) for @xmath78 the eigenfunctions are practically chaotic and fully extended since @xmath79 .",
    "despite the fact that the transition region for @xmath71 , which takes place in the range @xmath80 , is very large as compared to that for @xmath36 , both quantities are highly correlated and characterize well the poisson to wigner - dyson transition of spectral and eigenfunction properties of the adjacency matrices of er _ fully _ random networks as a function of @xmath12 .",

    "each point was computed by averaging over @xmath53 eigenfunctions . ]",
    "notice that with the prescription given above our er _ fully _ random network model displays maximal disorder , because averaging over the network ensemble implies average over connectivity and over connection strengths . with this averaging procedure we get rid off any individual network characteristic ( such as scars @xcite , which in turn produce topological resonances @xcite ) that may lead to deviations from rmt predictions used here as a reference ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , we choose this network model to retrieve well known random matrices in the appropriate limits  remember that a diagonal random matrix is obtained for @xmath4 , when the vertices are isolated , whereas a member of the goe is recovered for @xmath5 , when the network is fully connected .    however , it is important to add that the maximal disorder we consider above is not necessary for a graph / network to exhibit universal rmt behavior .",
    "in fact , it is well known that tight - binding cubic lattices with on - site disorder ( known as the three - dimensional anderson model @xcite ) , forming networks with fixed regular connectivity having very dilute adjacency matrices , show rmt behavior in the metallic phase ( see for example refs .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated numerically and theoretically that graphs with fixed connectivity show spectral  @xcite and scattering @xcite universal properties corresponding to rmt predictions . in this case",
    "the disorder is introduced either by choosing random bond lengths @xcite ( which is a parameter not present in our network model ) or by randomizing the vertex - scattering matrices @xcite ( somehow equivalent to consider random connection strengths ) .",
    "some of the rmt properties of quantum graphs have already been tested experimentally by the use of small ensembles of small microwave networks with fixed connectivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , complex networks having specific topological properties ( such as small - world and scale - free networks , where randomness is applied only to the connectivity ) show signatures of rmt behavior in their spectral and eigenfunction properties @xcite .",

    "( [ aij ] ) ) . even though it has been shown that the @xmath0 of _ standard _ er random networks is close to the wigner - dyson shape for large connectivity ( @xmath83 ) @xcite , notice that @xmath0 can not show the poisson to wigner - dyson transition since in the limit of vanishing connectivity ( @xmath4 ) the corresponding adjacency matrices are the null matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the distribution @xmath0 for _ standard _ er random networks of size @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that once @xmath12 is large enough @xmath0 acquires the expected wigner - dyson shape .",
    "however , for smaller values of @xmath12 , @xmath0 develops two components : ( i ) a prominent peak at @xmath84 and ( ii ) a broad part having a local maximum at @xmath85 .",
    "the presence of these two components avoids the use of the brody distribution to describe the shape of @xmath0 in the transition from isolated vertices to fully connected networks .",

    "@xcite ; however , for @xmath86 only .",
    "the reason to report such a narrow range of @xmath12 is because for vanishing connectivity this model does not approach the poisson limit and @xmath0 can not be fitted by brody distribution .    concerning the shannon entropy and the entropic eigenfunction localization length for this random network model , we observe , as expected , that @xmath70 and @xmath71 approach zero when @xmath87 , whereas they approach one when @xmath83 .",

    "( ii ) the rewiring probability @xmath92 is a parameter , independent of @xmath95 , which drives the sw network model from regular to random .",
    "also , we should stress that as well as for _ standard _ er random networks , the adjacency matrices of _ standard _ sw networks have zeros in their main diagonal .",
    "this prohibits the use of the brody distribution to fit the @xmath0 of _ standard _ sw networks when @xmath92 and @xmath95 are both small .",
    "however , for large @xmath92 and @xmath95 , @xmath0 becomes close to the wigner - dyson distribution , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite ( for an analytical approach to the spectra of sw networks see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "then , as we did in the previous section for er random networks , here we also consider sw networks with _",
    "diagonal disorder_. that is , we include self - edges having random strengths ( drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance one ) to each vertex in the network , such that the corresponding adjacency matrices exhibit random variables in their main diagonal , whereas the edges joining vertex pairs are still represented by ones in the adjacency matrices . in this way we guarantee that @xmath0 will have the poisson shape when @xmath92 and @xmath95 are both small .",
    "moreover , we observe ( not shown here ) that by including _ diagonal disorder _ , the brody distribution fits reasonably well the @xmath0 of sw networks for any combination of @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "the delocalization transition in sw networks with _ diagonal disorder _ has also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of @xmath92 , @xmath3 , and disorder strength by the use of the inverse participation ratio of eigenfunctions ( equivalent to the entropic eigenfunction localization length we use here ) ; however , the goal there was the implementation of a quantum algorithm able to efficiently simulate the network .    figure  [ fig8 ] shows the brody parameter @xmath36 as a function of @xmath92 ( for several values of @xmath95 ) and @xmath95 ( for several values of @xmath92 ) for sw networks with _ diagonal disorder _ of size @xmath27 .",
    "except for @xmath96 , where @xmath0 is very close to poissonian for any @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath97 ) , since the corresponding adjacency matrix is almost diagonal , @xmath0 shows the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson as a function of @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) ) . from this figure",
    "we can see that the larger the value of @xmath95 , the smaller the value of @xmath92 needed for @xmath36 to approach one .",
    "notice , for example , that for @xmath98 the value of @xmath99 makes @xmath36 to be very close to one .",
    "clearly , the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson in the form of @xmath0 is also observed as a function of @xmath95 for fixed @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ) .     as a function of ( a ) the rewiring probability @xmath92 and ( b ) the degree @xmath95 for sw networks with _ diagonal disorder _ of size @xmath27 . ]",
    "( normalized to @xmath3 ) as a function of the rewiring probability @xmath92 for sw networks with _ diagonal disorder _ of sizes ranging from @xmath52 to 4000 .",
    "( a ) @xmath96 , ( b ) @xmath100 , ( c ) @xmath101 , and ( d ) @xmath98 . ]",
    "also , in ref .",
    "@xcite the brody parameter has been reported as function of @xmath92 but for _ standard _ sw networks with fixed size @xmath102 and average degree @xmath103 .",
    "the goal there was to show that @xmath36 is correlated with two important network parameters : the characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient ; quantities which are out of the scope of our paper .",
    "anyhow , the delocalization transition was clearly shown as a function of @xmath92 ( analogous to our curves reported in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) for sw networks with _ diagonal disorder _ ) .",
    "we have to stress that , in contrast to er random networks with _ diagonal disorder _",
    ", where the average degree @xmath12 fixes their spectral and eigenfunction properties , the degree @xmath95 does not fix the properties of sw networks with _",
    "diagonal disorder_. this fact is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where we show @xmath71 as a function of @xmath92 for sw networks of four different sizes .",
    "each panel corresponds to a fixed value of degree @xmath95 where the curves approach each other only when @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we have to mention that in analogy with the er _ fully _ random networks we studied in sect .",
    "ii , here we also considered the case of sw _ fully _ random networks ; i.e. all non - zero entries of the corresponding adjacency matrices , including the main diagonal , were considered as random variables ( in fact , this case has been approached in ref .",
    "@xcite where the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson in the shape of @xmath0 was reported as a function of @xmath92 for a network with the fixed parameters @xmath105 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , we have not observed a substantial difference to the results reported in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] ( not shown here ) .",
    "we have studied numerically some spectral and eigenfunction properties of erds - rnyi  type random networks focusing our attention on universality .",
    "in particular , we have shown for erds - rnyi ( er ) _ fully _ random networks ( where all non - vanishing adjacency matrix elements are gaussian random variables ) and er networks with _ diagonal disorder _ ( where the diagonal adjacency matrix elements are gaussian random variables , whereas the rest of non - vanishing matrix elements are ones ) that : ( i ) the nearest - neighbor energy level spacing distribution @xmath0 , the average shannon entropy @xmath22 , and the entropic eigenfunction localization length @xmath23 are universal for fixed average degree @xmath44 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the network connectivity and the network size , respectively ) ; ( ii ) brody distribution fits well @xmath0 in the transition from poisson ( @xmath4 ; isolated vertices ) to wigner - dyson ( @xmath5 ; fully connected network ) ; and ( iii ) the brody parameter @xmath36 as a function of @xmath12 displays an invariant curve .",
    "specifically , for er _ fully _ random networks and er networks with _ diagonal disorder _ we have found that when @xmath106 , @xmath0 is well described by the poisson shape .",
    "this range of @xmath12 values coincides with the regime where a typical er random graph is composed of isolated trees @xcite .",
    "we have heuristically located the delocalization transition point around @xmath107 , in close agreement with the transition value of @xmath17 reported in refs .",
    "also note that @xmath108 , known as the average degree value at which the diameter of an er random graph equals the diameter of the giant cluster @xcite , is located about half the way in the poisson to wigner - dyson transition .",
    "also , we have observed that for @xmath0 to approach the wigner - dyson shape @xmath56 is needed .",
    "however , we have determined that there is no universal scaling of @xmath70 and @xmath71 when plotted as a function of @xmath12 for the _ standard _ er model nor for sw networks ; even though these two quantities describe well the delocalization transition of both models . moreover",
    ", we can affirm that _",
    "diagonal disorder _ is needed for a random network model to show the poisson to wigner - dyson transition in the form of @xmath0 .",
