    "in recent years , entanglement has become an important resource for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "quantum computation @xcite , which is more efficient than classical computation for certain problems @xcite , could also potentially owe its efficiency to entanglement @xcite .",
    "though the precise role of entanglement in quantum computation is not yet well understood , entangled states are certainly generated during the course of certain quantum computations .",
    "a quantum computation , when halted at an appropriate point , can be regarded as a method of generating entanglement .",
    "typically , a quantum computation is a multiparticle interference experiment with different phases applied to distinct multiparticle states @xcite . in general , the phases applied to the multiparticle states during a quantum computation are _ global phases _ as they depend on the total state of a collection of qubits . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the types of entanglement generated by such global phases and the conditions under which such phases do not generate any entanglement .",
    "the model of quantum computation which motivates our work is that presented by cleve , ekert , macchiavello and mosca @xcite .",
    "this model ( with a slight alteration which does not change its principal ingredient ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "each of the qubits , initially in the @xmath0 state , is first transformed according to a hadamard transformation .",
    "this is shown in the figure by the giant hadamard transformation acting on all the qubits and converts the total state of the qubits to @xmath1 labels the @xmath2 possible states of the type @xmath3 in which each @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",

    "a state dependent global phase @xmath7 is now applied to each state @xmath8 .",
    "this is shown as the second giant transformation @xmath9 in the figure .",
    "this converts the total state to @xmath10 where @xmath11 are real and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is reassigned the value @xmath14 ) .",
    "this state @xmath15 , generated as a result of global phases , can be entangled .",
    "we propose to halt the quantum computation at this stage and investigate the amount of entanglement generated . a complete quantum computation , of course , consists of one more step in which another giant hadamard transformation is applied to all the qubits as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "but in this paper we are interested in the entanglement of the state _ prior _ to this last transformation .",
    "the entanglement of @xmath15 comes from the global phase factors @xmath7 .",
    "first , we study conditions on the phase function @xmath7 for the state @xmath15 to be disentangled .",
    "next , we derive the entanglement of three - qubit pure states ( @xmath16 ) for the special case in which only one or two of the global phase parameters are nonzero .",
    "we study variation of the entanglement as a function of one global phase parameter for a mixed state of three qubits by numerical calculations . finally , we discuss the implications of this type of entanglement arising in deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "in particular we show that for obtaining exponential advantage over its classical counterpart , entangled states must necessarily arise in deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "we first derive the conditions on @xmath11 for @xmath15 to be disentangled , i.e. , @xmath17 in a case of two qubits ( @xmath18 ) , we can write the condition as follows , @xmath19-[f(2)-f(3)]=2\\pi n,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is an arbitrary integer .",

    "we have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of global phases to the pure product state @xmath178 to result in entanglement .",
    "we have then investigated the amount of two qubit entanglement that can be generated in three - qubit pure states when only one or two of the global phase parameters are nonzero .",
    "an interesting , though potentially difficult , future direction will be in the investigation of the quantity of entanglement when all phase parameters are present for an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "while we have obtained the conditions for _ presence _ or _ absence _ of entanglement in the general case , it would be interesting to classify functions according to the _ degree _ of entanglement they can generate .",
    "we have also examined entanglement generation through a single global phase parameter for mixed initial states .",
    "the general problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement by global phases for mixed states remains open .",
    "one could expect counterintuitive results in that case as the same global phase function might entangle one pure component and disentangle another pure component of a mixture of two pure states .",
    "finally , we have applied our conditions to prove the necessity of entanglement in the deutsch - jozsa algorithm for the algorithm to have an exponential advantage over its classical counterpart .",
    "it would be interesting to apply similar techniques to the investigation of the role of entanglement in other quantum algorithms .    c.  h.  bennett and d.  p.  divincenzo , nature * 404 * , 247 ( 2000 ) .",
