    "the presence of shell gaps with magic numbers of nucleons is a cornerstone of nuclear structure . over the past decade",
    "it has increasingly become clear that magic numbers are not immutable , but depend on the ratio of protons and neutrons @xcite . in discussions of magic numbers , neutron number",
    "@xmath7 has historically been a subject of debate , especially in the case of the ni isotopes .",
    "proton number @xmath9 is magic , and , for neutrons , a sizable energy gap at @xmath7 is thought to separate the @xmath10 shell from the intruder @xmath8 state , potentially making @xmath9 , @xmath7 @xmath11ni a doubly - magic nucleus . experimentally , the occurrence of shell closures in @xmath11ni was first suggested based on the observation of a 1770-kev 0@xmath12 level as the lowest excited state , followed by a 2@xmath13 state of relatively high excitation energy ( 2034 kev ) @xcite .",
    "the discovery of several isomeric states in @xmath11ni and in neighboring nuclei @xcite supported the case for its magic character further , as did the results from coulomb excitation measurements indicating a @xmath14 reduced transition probability roughly three times smaller than the corresponding value for @xmath15ni@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , based on recent high - precision mass measurements in the neutron - rich ni isotopes ( up to @xmath17ni ) , the @xmath7 shell closure appears to be more doubtful when inferred from changes in the two - neutron separation energies @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in the literature that the apparent contradiction between the @xmath18 value and the separation energy is a consequence of the parity change across the @xmath7 gap , with a sizable fraction of the low - lying @xmath18 strength residing in excited states around 4 mev , and the 2@xmath13 level being associated predominantly with a neutron - pair excitation @xcite .",
    "the size of the @xmath7 gap is then of the order of 2 mev only and the corresponding discontinuity in the sequence of orbitals corresponds at most to a subshell closure .",
    "beta - decay studies @xcite and in - beam investigations at intermediate beam energies @xcite provide evidence for the onset of collectivity and strong polarization of the @xmath11ni core in neighboring nuclei of the region .",
    "for example , the 2@xmath13 levels in @xmath7 @xmath1cr @xcite and @xmath19fe @xcite are located at excitation energies as low as 420 and 573 kev , respectively . more generally , the available low - spin level structures in these nuclei suggest sizable admixture of spherical and deformed components in the configurations near their ground states . these observations , combined with the large @xmath20 value measured for @xmath21ni@xmath22 @xcite , lead to the conclusion that any  island \" of nuclei with indications of a significant @xmath7 gap is rather localized .",
    "a main contributor to this situation is the monopole tensor force @xcite between protons in the @xmath10 shell and @xmath8 neutrons , where the occupation of the latter orbital leads to the onset of deformation , as evidenced , for example , by the presence of rotational bands in neutron - rich @xmath23cr and @xmath24fe nuclei @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "couplings of protons and/or neutrons to the @xmath11ni core do not always result in a large polarization of the core .",
    "for example , the first excited state above the ( 19/2@xmath4 ) isomer in @xmath25cu is located 2020 kev higher in energy , herewith mirroring the location of the 2@xmath13 level in @xmath11ni @xcite .    from the considerations above ,",
    "it is clear that a satisfactory description of nuclear structure in this mass region is still lacking .",
    "this is also reflected in on - going theoretical efforts to determine the most appropriate interactions for use in the calculations . in this context , the present data on the neutron - hole nucleus @xmath0ni provide an opportunity to test the most modern interactions while investigating the nature of yrast excitations up to moderate spin .",
    "at present , only limited information is available on the low - lying structure of @xmath0ni . using deep - inelastic reactions of a @xmath1ni beam at 350 mev on a thick @xmath26pb target , pawat _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified a 1008-kev isomeric state with a half - life of t@xmath27 @xmath3s decaying through coincident 314- and 694-kev transitions towards the @xmath0ni ground state .",
    "the presence of the isomer was later confirmed in a fragmentation measurement where a 13.3(2)-@xmath3s half - life was determined @xcite .",
    "feeding of the isomer in @xmath0co @xmath28 decay was subsequently reported @xcite .",
    "these three studies @xcite proposed spin and parity quantum numbers of 9/2@xmath29 for the long - lived state and associated this level with the occupation of the @xmath8 orbital by a single neutron . with the nmr / on technique , the magnetic dipole moment of the 1/2@xmath4 ground state was measured to be + 0.601(5 ) @xmath30 , a value differing only slightly from the @xmath31 single - particle value ; a fact regarded as evidence for the strength of the @xmath7 shell closure @xcite . for the isomer , a quenched @xmath32-factor value of @xmath33=0.125(6 ) was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and was interpreted as evidence for a 2% admixture of a @xmath34 configuration involving a proton excitation across the @xmath9 gap into the supposedly pure @xmath35 state .",
    "prior to the present work , no transitions feeding the isomeric state had been reported . here ,",
    "despite the long half - life , eight new states have been placed above the isomer from an investigation of prompt - delayed coincidence events in a deep - inelastic reaction with a pulsed beam .",
    "a number of experiments have demonstrated that the yrast states of hard - to - reach neutron - rich nuclei can be populated in deep - inelastic processes at beam energies @xmath36 above the coulomb barrier @xcite , allowing experimental access to high - spin structures in regions inaccessible with conventional heavy - ion induced , fusion - evaporation reactions .",
    "the experiment was carried out with a @xmath1ni beam delivered by the atlas superconducting linear accelerator at argonne national laboratory .",
    "the 430-mev beam energy was chosen to correspond roughly to an energy of 20@xmath37 above the coulomb barrier in the middle of a 55-mg/@xmath38 thick @xmath2u target .",
    "the beam was pulsed with a 412-ns repetition rate , each beam pulse being",
    "@xmath39@xmath40 ns wide .",
    "gammasphere @xcite , with 100 compton - suppressed hpge detectors , was used to collect events with three or more @xmath41 rays in coincidence .",
    "the data were sorted into two - dimensional ( @xmath42 matrices ) and three - dimensional ( @xmath43 cubes ) histograms under various timing conditions . the prompt @xmath44 cube ( ppp cube )",
    "was incremented for @xmath41 rays observed within @xmath4520 ns of the beam burst while , in the delayed @xmath44 cube ( ddd cube ) , the transitions were required to occur in an interval of @xmath3940 to @xmath39800 ns after the prompt time peak ( excluding the subsequent beam pulse ) , but within @xmath4520 ns of each other . in this way , events associated with isomeric deexcitations could be isolated and identified .",
    "the prompt - delayed - delayed ( pdd ) and prompt - prompt - delayed ( ppd ) cubes were incremented by combining prompt and delayed events .",
    "these proved critical in identifying prompt @xmath41 rays feeding isomeric levels as they revealed themselves in double - gated spectra on the known transitions below the isomer in the pdd cubes .",
    "the relations between these prompt @xmath41 rays were subsequently established by examining proper double coincidence gates in the ppd and ppp cubes .",
    "examples and further details of this technique can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the spins and parities of the levels were deduced from an angular - correlation analysis .",
    "in addition , considerations based on the fact that the reactions feed yrast states preferentially , and/or on comparisons with shell - model calculations , were also taken into account .",
    "the projectile - like products of deep - inelastic reactions are usually characterized by no , or very little , alignment .",
    "therefore , the analysis of @xmath41@xmath41 angular correlations for selected pairs of transitions is required @xcite . in practice , in order to avoid as much as possible ambiguities in the spin assignments , at least one known stretched transition was included in the analysis .",
    "in previous studies @xcite , the 314- and 694-kev transitions deexciting the 13.3(2)-@xmath3s isomer in @xmath0ni were assigned to the @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48@xmath47@xmath49 cascade and no transition above this long - lived state was reported .",
    "as stated above , transitions feeding the isomer were initially identified in the present work by using the pdd coincidence data . a coincidence spectrum from this pdd cube with double gates placed on the 314- and 694-kev transitions",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01 ] . besides a 1345-kev line belonging to the @xmath50 transition in @xmath1ni , three @xmath41 rays are clearly visible at 1210 , 1655 , and 1667 kev .",
    "the 1345-kev line originates from coulomb excitation of the @xmath1ni beam , and is attributed to random coincidences . by double gating the pdd cube with one of the newly discovered prompt @xmath41 rays and one of the delayed transitions , their mutual coincidence relationships can be verified further .",
    "the results , displayed in fig .  [ fig : fig02 ] , establish the feeding of the @xmath0ni isomer by the 1210- and 1655-kev transitions .",
    "finally , additional evidence was provided by the analysis of the ppd cube , where a double gate on the prompt 1655- and 1667-kev @xmath41 rays yields a delayed spectrum in which the 314- and 694-kev lines appear , consistent with the expected coincidence relationships for @xmath41 rays across the isomer .",
    "this observation also implies that the 1655- and 1667-kev transitions are in mutual , prompt coincidence .",
    "levels above the @xmath0ni isomer were investigated further in the ppp cube with the newly - observed 1210- , 1655- and 1667-kev transitions as a starting point .",
    "a double gate on the latter two @xmath41 rays reveals the presence of three additional lines at 63 , 172 , and 708 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig03 ] ) .",
    "the 1655- and 1210-kev transitions are not in mutual coincidence , herewith establishing the presence of parallel decay sequences . exploiting additional coincidence relationships , such as those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig04 ] , it was possible to propose the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig05 ] .",
    "thus , states at 2218 , 2663 , 3530 , 3913 , 4330 , and 4502 kev were firmly established through the various competing decay paths .",
    "the ordering of the highest levels at 4565 and 5273 kev is based on the measured @xmath41-ray intensities .",
    "the presence of a low - energy transition of 63 kev might suggest a longer half - life for the 4565-kev state .",
    "unfortunately , at this energy , the timing signal of the large - volume germanium detectors is rather poor .",
    "this fact , combined with the rather small intensity , made it impossible to obtain firm information on the level lifetime .",
    "however , time spectra gated on the transitions below the 4502-kev state do not provide evidence for a measurable lifetime and an upper limit of @xmath3915 ns can be given for the 4565-kev level .",
    "angular correlations were used to determine the multipolarity of some of the newly identified transitions . because the yield of the 314- and 694-kev isomeric cascade was sufficient , the relevant coincidence intensities were grouped into 12 different angles @xmath51 .",
    "the measured angular - correlation pattern for this pair strongly favors a sequence with two stretched quadrupole transitions , as can be seen from the comparison with the theoretical prediction of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig06](a ) , which agrees with a 9/2@xmath29@xmath475/2@xmath4@xmath471/2@xmath4 cascade . in view of the smaller intensities ,",
    "the correlation between the 1655- and the 1667-kev lines was grouped into five angles [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig06](b ) ]",
    ". it is consistent with a quadrupole - dipole sequence . to be consistent with the decay pattern of the 2663-kev level",
    ", the 1655-kev @xmath41 ray is proposed as a quadrupole transition , leading to a 13/2@xmath29 assignment for this state , and 15/2@xmath52 quantum numbers for the level at 4330 kev .    due to the lack of statistics",
    ", the correlation data for other transitions were regrouped into the two angles of 33@xmath53 ( from 20@xmath53 to 42@xmath53 in gammasphere ) and 77@xmath53 ( 69@xmath53 to 87@xmath53 ) .",
    "intensity ratios were obtained for the 1655 - 1250 , 1655 - 172 , and 1210 - 1695 kev pairs of transitions .",
    "the ratio of 0.81(9 ) measured for the 1655 - 1250 kev cascade points to a dipole character for the 1250-kev @xmath41 ray , resulting in a 15/2@xmath29 assignment to the 3913-kev level . with this 15/2@xmath29 assignment and the measured 1.8(3 ) ratio indicating a quadrupole - dipole cascade for the 1210 - 1695 kev pair where the dipole transition has a large @xmath54 mixing ratio , a consistent picture emerges with the proposed 11/2@xmath29 spin and parity for the 2218-kev state .",
    "note that the mixed - dipole character for the 1210-kev transition is also consistent with the expectations of shell - model calculations , as will be discussed below .",
    "a 17/2 spin assignment to the 4502-kev state was derived from the 0.85(4 ) correlation ratio measured for the 1655 - 172 kev pair . even though correlation data could not be extracted for the 1210 - 1312 kev cascade , the 13/2@xmath29 assignment to the 3530-kev level",
    "is supported by the presence of the weak , 2522-kev decay branch towards the 9/2@xmath29 isomer .",
    "finally , the general agreement between these assignments and the results of shell - model calculations was used to tentatively propose 19/2@xmath4 and 21/2@xmath4 assignments to the two highest states .",
    "the experimental information on levels in @xmath0ni is summarized in table  [ table : tab01 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the absence of lifetime information on the @xmath0ni levels above the isomer , additional tests of the shell - model calculations are possible by considering the branching ratios for transitions competing in the deexcitation of specific levels . for the computation of the @xmath18 transition probabilities , proton and neutron effective charges @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 were adopted as is usual for nuclei in this region .",
    "comparisons between computed branchings for the two hamiltonians and the data are presented in table  [ table : tab02 ] .",
    "only cases for which the coincidence yields were sufficient to allow gating on the transitions directly feeding a state of interest were considered for table  [ table : tab02 ] .",
    "note that this table provides shell - model results using either the calculated or the measured transition energies .",
    "the latter values effectively remove the dependence of the ratios on the transition energies . from the table , it is clear that calculations with the jun45 hamiltonian are consistently in better agreement with the measured branching ratios .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that both hamiltonians also compute a @xmath57 transition of strongly mixed @xmath54 character ( @xmath58 ) , in agreement with the angular - correlation data for the 1210 - 1695 kev cascade ( see section iii ) .    from the discussion above",
    ", it is concluded that the levels above the 9/2@xmath29 isomeric state can be understood as neutron excitations , with contributions of protons across the @xmath9 gap playing a minor role at best .",
    "calculations with both interactions are in fair agreement with the data .",
    "they attribute a significant role to the @xmath8 neutron orbital for every state observed in this measurement .",
    "in fact , in most cases , significant @xmath59 and @xmath60 configurations are part of the wave functions .",
    "similar observations have been made for other nuclei close to @xmath11ni ; see , for example , recent comparisons between calculations with the same jj44b and jun45 interactions and data for @xmath61cu in ref .",
    "@xcite . from these findings , it is concluded that even in a nucleus only one neutron removed from @xmath7 , the impact of a neutron shell closure is rather modest . as the @xmath8 neutron orbital is shape driving , multi particle - hole excitations involving this state may be expected to be associated with enhanced collectivity and it would be of interest to investigate the latter in future measurements .",
    "a level scheme above the known 13-@xmath3s isomer in @xmath0ni was established for the first time by exploring prompt and delayed coincidence relationships from deep - inelastic reaction products .",
    "spin and parity quantum numbers for the newly observed states were deduced from an angular - correlation analysis whenever sufficient statistics was available .",
    "shell - model calculations have been carried out with two modern effective interactions , jun45 and jj44b , for the @xmath5 model space with @xmath6ni as a core .",
    "satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory was achieved .",
    "even though the level structure of @xmath0ni appears to exhibit a single - particle character based on comparisons between the measured level properties , including branching ratios , with the results of shell - model calculations , it is suggested that the yrast and near - yrast states are associated with rather complex configurations .",
    "in fact , calculations indicate that the wave functions of the yrast states involve a large number of configurations without a dominant ( @xmath3950% ) specific one ; the latter being more prevalent in the near - yrast levels .",
    "it is hoped that the present data will stimulate additional theoretical work such as comparisons with calculations using other effective interactions or a different model space .",
