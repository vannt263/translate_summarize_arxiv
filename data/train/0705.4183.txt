    "the series of experiments na48 , having a multipurpose large samples of neutral and charged kaon decays , continues to provide new results in the field of kaon physics . in this paper briefly",
    "are described some of the recent measurements from all three stages of the experimental program : na48 , na48/1 and na48/2 .",
    "the experiment na48 ( 1997 - 2000 ) was dedicated to the measurement of direct @xmath0-violation in @xmath9 decays .",
    "the next stage , na48/1 ( 2002 ) , was orientated mainly to the study of rare @xmath10 decays .",
    "the final stage , na48/2 ( 2003 - 2004 ) , was designed to search for direct @xmath0-violation in @xmath11 decays ( see section  [ ag ] ) . besides these central topics ,",
    "many other analyses were performed .",
    "the na48 beam line was designed to produce and transport both @xmath12 and @xmath10 beams simultaneously . a description of the beam line , as well as of the na48 detectors , can be found in@xcite .",
    "two of the measurements presented in this paper are performed during a dedicated 1999 na48 run .",
    "the @xmath12 beam was produced by sps 450 gev/@xmath13 proton beam on a beryllium target .",
    "the beginning of the decay volume was defined by the last of three collimators , located 126 m downstream of the target .    for the na48/1 experiment",
    "the @xmath12 beam was removed and the proton flux on the @xmath10 target was greatly increased .",
    "a 24 mm platinum absorber was placed after the be target to reduce the photon flux in the neutral beam .",
    "a beam of long - lived neutral particles ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) was selected by the sweeping magnet , installed across the 5.2 m long collimator .",
    "the neutral beams were replaced by simultaneous @xmath18 and @xmath19 beams for the na48/2 experiment .",
    "the momentum @xmath20 gev/@xmath13 was formed symmetrically for @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the first achromat ( see fig .  [ beams ] ) , in which the two beams were split in the vertical plane . in the second achromat",
    "were placed two of the three stations of the kaon beam spectrometer ( kabes ) .",
    "the beams followed the same path in the decay volume , comprised in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank .",
    "the beam axes coincided to 1 mm , while their lateral size is about 1 cm .",
    "the na48 detectors , used in the presented analyses , are :    * a magnetic spectrometer for charged particles reconstruction , with 4 drift chambers ; the momentum resolution is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is in gev/@xmath13 ; * a charged hodoscope , with good time resolution , which sends fast trigger signals ; * calorimeter with an active volume of 10 m@xmath23 liquid krypton ( lkr ) with energy resolution of @xmath24 and space resolution of @xmath25 cm , where the energy @xmath26 is in gev ; * a muon detector .",
    "one of the most promising observables for direct @xmath0-violation in kaon physics is the asymmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath19 decaying to three pions .",
    "usually , the matrix element of @xmath1 decays is parameterized in the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the slope parameters .",
    "the dalitz - variables are defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the charged pion mass , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are kaon and @xmath39-th pion four - momenta respectively .",
    "the index @xmath40 corresponds to the odd pion , i.e. the pion with a charge different from the other two .",
    "the parameter of direct @xmath0-violation is usually defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the linear coefficients in ( [ eq : mel ] ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the experimental precision for such asymmetry for both modes , @xmath44 and @xmath3 , is at the level of @xmath45 . the standard model ( sm ) predictions are below few @xmath46  @xcite",
    ", however some theoretical calculations involving processes beyond the sm do not exclude enhancements of the asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of na48/2 experiment was a search for direct @xmath0-violation at the level of @xmath47 in both @xmath48 decay modes .",
    "the method of such a high precision asymmetry measurement is based on direct comparison of the @xmath49-ratios for @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays in which the main possible systematic effects cancel due to the presence of simultaneous @xmath18 and @xmath19 beams and the frequent alternation of the magnet polarities in the beam optics and in the magnetic spectrometer . in the @xmath44 selection",
    ", only the magnetic spectrometer was involved in the reconstruction of the events , while the analysis in @xmath3 mode was based mainly on the information from a charge blinded detector  lkr .    in total @xmath50",
    "billion @xmath44 and @xmath51 million @xmath3 decays were collected during 2003 and 2004 runs and the final result on asymmetries @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , yields : @xmath54 @xmath55    both measurements are limited by the statistics and are one order of magnitude more accurate than the previous experiments . the observed results are compatible with the sm predictions .",
    "the method of measurement , selection of the events and the studies of main systematic contributions are described in more details in@xcite and@xcite .",
    "the last measurements of the dalitz slopes @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ eq : mel ] ) for @xmath44 decay mode are 30 years old . na48/2 performed a new high precision measurement in order to verify the validity of the parameterization ( [ eq : mel ] ) .",
    "approximately @xmath56 @xmath44 decays were selected for the analysis .",
    "the measurement method is based on fitting of the binned reconstructed @xmath57 data distribution with a sum of four mc components generated according to the four terms in the polynomial expansion .",
    "the free parameters in the fitting procedure are the slopes @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the overall normalization parameter .",
    "the obtained results , ignoring radiative effects ( apart from coulomb factor ) and strong rescaterring effects , are : @xmath58 the values are with precision one order of magnitude better , than the previous experiments and are in agreement with the world averages .",
    "this is the first measurement of non - zero value of @xmath29 .",
    "the quality of the fit of @xmath59 ) distribution ( @xmath60 , yielding a satisfactory probability of @xmath61 ) shows that the polynomial parameterization ( [ eq : mel ] ) is still acceptable at an improved level of precision ( the rescaterring effects are much weaker than in @xmath3 mode ) .",
    "no significant higher order slope parameters were found . more information on this analysis can be found in@xcite .",
    "the single - flavour quark condensate @xmath62 is a fundamental parameter of @xmath63pt , which determines the relative size of mass and momentum terms in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is a free parameter in the theory and must be determined experimentally .",
    "the relation between @xmath62 and @xmath64-wave @xmath2 scattering lengths @xmath65 and @xmath66 in isospin states @xmath67 and @xmath68 , correspondingly , are known with precision of @xmath69@xcite , so the experimental measurement of @xmath65 and @xmath66 provides an important constraints for @xmath63pt lagrangian parameters . in the framework of na48/2 , the scattering lengths can be measured from @xmath3 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) decays .      during the analysis of @xmath72 million @xmath3 decays , taken in 2003 , a sudden `` cusp '' like structure",
    "was found in the spectra of @xmath73 invariant mass at @xmath74 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cusp ] , _ a _ ) .",
    "a fit to the data with the parameterization ( [ eq : mel ] ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cusp ] , _ b _ ) yielded an unacceptable probability of @xmath75 , while the area above the `` cusp '' was well described ( @xmath76 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     ( -260,-50)_a _ ( -80,-50)_b _    the form factors of @xmath71 decay can be parameterized as a function of five kinematic variables : the invariant masses @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the angles @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see fig .  [ ke4 ] ) .",
    "the hadronic part in the matrix element can be described in terms of two axial ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) and one vector ( @xmath84 ) form factors@xcite .",
    "their expansion into partial @xmath85 and @xmath22 waves ( neglecting @xmath86 waves ) and into a taylor series in @xmath87 allows a measurement of the form factor parameters from the experimental data@xcite@xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 @xmath90    analysing part of 2003 data , @xmath91 @xmath4 decays were selected with background of @xmath92 , mainly from @xmath48 decays with @xmath93 or pion mis - identification .    the following method was used to extract the form factor parameters : in a first step , in ( @xmath77,@xmath78,@xmath94,@xmath95,@xmath81 ) space were defined 10x5x5x5x12 iso - populated bins . for each bin in @xmath77",
    ", comparing data and mc , ten independent five - parameter ( @xmath96 ) fits were performed . in the second step",
    "a fit of the distributions in @xmath77 was performed to extract the form factor parameters .",
    "the @xmath97 distribution was fitted with a one - parameter function given by the numerical solution of the roy equations@xcite , in order to determine @xmath98 , while @xmath99 was constrained to lie on the centre of the universal band .",
    "the following preliminary results were obtained : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 where the systematic uncertainty was determined by comparing two independent analyses and taking into account the effect of the reconstruction method , acceptance , fit method , uncertainty on background estimate , electron identification efficiency , radiative corrections and bias due to the neglected @xmath78 dependence .",
    "the form factors are measured relative to @xmath107 , which is related to the decay rate .",
    "the obtained value for @xmath98 is compatible with the @xmath63pt prediction@xcite and with previous experiments@xcite .",
    "the form factors were measured also for @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) decays , on @xmath110 selected events from 2003 run and @xmath111 events from 2004 run , using the same formalism . due to symmetry of @xmath73 system ,",
    "the @xmath112-wave is not present and only two parameter are left : @xmath113 @xmath114 the preliminary result is compatible with @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the branching fraction of @xmath109 was measured by using only 2003 data , normalising to @xmath3 : @xmath115 where the systematic uncertainty takes into account the effect of acceptance , trigger efficiency and energy measurement of the calorimeter , while the external uncertainty is due to the uncertainty on the @xmath3 branching fraction .",
    "the result is @xmath116 times more precise than the previous measurement .",
    "a measurement of direct photon emission ( de ) with respect to inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and the interference ( int ) between these two amplitudes was performed on a subsample of na48/2 collected during 2003 run .",
    "the @xmath117 are described in terms of two kinematic variables : the energy of charged pion in kaon center of mass system ( @xmath118 ) , and @xmath119 , where @xmath37 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the four - momenta of the kaon , charged pion and the odd gamma .",
    "about @xmath122 events were selected in the ranges @xmath123 mev and @xmath124 . in the previous measurements a lower cut @xmath125 mev",
    "was introduced in order to suppress @xmath3 and @xmath126 background . in na48/2 measurement",
    "these backgrounds are avoided with an application of a special algorithm , which detects overlapping gamma in the detector and a maximum allowed deviation of reconstructed @xmath127 mass @xmath128 mev from its nominal value .",
    "the upper cut on @xmath118 rejects @xmath126 decays .",
    "the background in the selected sample is kept under @xmath129 .",
    "the photon mistagging ( i.e. , choice of wrong odd photon ) is estimated to be less than 0.1% .",
