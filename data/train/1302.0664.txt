    "it is apparent from table  [ tab2:table ] that the deformability parameters had to be modified from the corresponding rldm values considerably to fit the experimental spectra . following the empirical procedure given in refs .",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that the above change in the deformability parameters is indicative of substantial enhancement of the deformation of the excited composite over the corresponding ground state ( rldm ) deformation .",
    "before we look further into the origin of such deformation , it may be worthwhile to see if there is any other alternative explanation of the observed deviation of the experimental spectra from the respective standard statistical model prediction .",
    "though the present formalism of angular momentum dependent level density is largely successful in explaining experimental lcp spectra , the magnitude of enhancement required is quite large and lacking proper explanation @xcite .",
    "so an alternative approach , based on frozen degrees of freedom , has been proposed , which has been shown to reproduce the data quite well @xcite . in this approach , it is assumed that the deformation of the cn is frozen during the decay , i.e. , there is no change of shape of the nascent final nucleus ; so the phase space is calculated using rldm deformation of the parent nucleus , rather than that of the usual daughter nucleus .",
    "this indicates that the dynamical effects such as shape relaxation should be taken into account to properly understand the phenomenon of particle evaporation from a deformed cn .",
    "the formalism of `` frozen deformation '' has been applied in the present cascade calculation . in the case of @xmath0 particle emission",
    ", the effect of frozen deformation on the energy spectrum may be taken into account in the following way .",
    "as the @xmath0 particles are emitted predominantly at the initial stage of the decay cascade , the deformation may be `` frozen '' at its value corresponding to the highest angular momentum that the cn may have , which is @xmath84 .",
    "so in the present cascade calculation , the deformation has been kept fixed throughout by freezing the value of @xmath85 , which has been calculated using a fixed value of @xmath86 using eq .",
    "[ eq : i_eff ] with @xmath56 and @xmath58 obtained from rldm ( see table  [ tab2:table ] ) .",
    "the results of the cascade calculation with frozen deformation have been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5:frozen ] along with the experimental data .",
    "it is observed that the cascade prediction with frozen deformation @xcite for @xmath87 ( solid curve ) is also in fair agreement with the experimental data .    to investigate",
    "further into the nature of deformation , we have computed the values of average effective radius parameter,@xmath88 , for all sets of deformability parameters ( table  [ tab2:table ] ) . following @xcite , the effective radius parameter , _ r@xmath72 _ , is defined as @xmath89 , and the average effective radius parameter is calculated using the expression , @xmath88 = @xmath90 .",
    "then the deviation of @xmath88 from _",
    "r@xmath69 _ is the measure of deformation , and the deviation of the same from the corresponding rldm value may be considered as an enhancement .",
    "the values of _",
    "r@xmath72 _ estimated in the case of ` frozen ' deformation approach varied between 1.48 ( at 117 mev ) and 1.58 ( at 160 mev ) , which are , though higher than the corresponding rldm values ( @xmath91 @xmath7 1.38 - 1.42 ) , quite lower than the values obtained with the best fitted parameter set ( @xmath92 @xmath7 1.52 - 1.66 ) . from the above discussion , it may be said that , though the present study indicates deformation of the excited composite which is higher than the corresponding rldm value , uncertainty still remains about the actual magnitude of deformation .",

    "solid curve represents the cascade calculations done using ` frozen ' deformation ( @xmath85 ) obtained using rldm deformability parameters for @xmath93 . ]",
    "the energy and angular distribution of @xmath0 particles , emitted in the reactions @xmath1o ( 117 , 125 , 145 and 160 mev ) + @xmath2c , have been measured .",
    "it has been observed from the angular distribution and average velocity plots that the @xmath0-particles are emitted from fully energy equilibrated sources , at all beam energies .",
    "the measured energy spectra have been compared with the same predicted by the standard statistical model calculations .",
    "it has been found that the experimental @xmath0 particle energy spectra are properly explained by cascade by optimizing the deformability parameters , which are quite different from the respective rldm values .",
    "this appears to be indicative of appreciable change ( enhancement ) of deformation .",
    "however , the understanding does not seem to be so simple and straightforward when one compares the above with the results of cascade calculation with frozen deformation , which has also been shown to be almost equally effective in explaining the data . in this case , the effective ` frozen ' deformation turned out to be smaller than that obtained using the optimized parameters .",
    "so , the uncertainties about the magnitudes of the actual cn deformations notwithstanding , it can , only qualitatively , be said that equilibrium orbiting , which is similar to particle evaporation in time scale , could also be one of the contributing factors for the observed deformation .",
    "however , the present models are too simplistic to predict the actual deformation of the cn ; more realistic event - by - event monte carlo calculations , taking into account the initial deformation , spin distribution of the cn and their subsequent evolutions , should be performed to have a proper understanding of the cn deformation .",
    "in addition , new experimental inputs ( such as measurement of deformation from gdr studies @xcite ) are needed for more comprehensive understanding of the process .",

    "<S> the energy spectra of the @xmath0 particles emitted in the reactions @xmath1o  ( 7 - 10 mev / nucleon )  +  @xmath2c have been measured in the center of mass angular range of 25@xmath3 @xmath4 70@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental energy spectra have been compared with those obtained from the statistical model calculation with `` deformability '' parameters predicted by rotating liquid drop model ( rldm ) and also fitted the same with optimized `` deformability '' parameters , which are quite different from the respective rldm values . </S>",
    "<S> the data have also been found to be explained quite well using `` frozen '' deformation approximation , where the `` deformability '' parameters have been kept fixed at rldm values of the parent nucleus throughout the decay process . </S>",
    "<S> the effective radius in the latter case is smaller compared to that obtained using the optimized parameters ; however , in both cases , the deformations ( effective radii ) are larger than the corresponding rldm values . </S>",
    "<S> so , considering the uncertainties in the estimation of actual compound nucleus deformations , it can , only qualitatively , be said that equilibrium orbiting , which is similar to particle evaporation in time scale , could also be one of the contributing factors for the observed deformation .    </S>",
