    "the inverse correlation of emission line equivalent width ( ew ) with luminosity , discovered by baldwin ( 1977 ) for c  iv , was intensively explored over the past 20 years ( see a comprehensive review by osmer & shields 1999 ; and more recent studies by green et al . 2001 ; croom et al . 2002 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ; richards et al . 2002 ; and shang et al . 2003 ) . the physical origin for this effect",
    "is not clearly established , but plausible explanations include changes with luminosity of the ionizing continuum shape , of the broad line region ( blr ) covering factor , of the mean blr ionization level , or possibly inclination effects .",
    "recent studies established that reasonably accurate estimates of the black hole mass ( @xmath1 ) can be obtained in agn based on the continuum luminosity and h@xmath3 fwhm ( e.g. laor 1998 ) .",
    "this opens up the possibility to explore whether the baldwin effect is related to @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we address this question in this paper , together with a related side question on whether the c  iv fwhm can be used instead of the h@xmath3 fwhm as a comparably accurate measure of @xmath1 .",
    "the narrow forbidden lines in agn show a larger range in ew compared to the broad lines , and they also show a baldwin effect .",
    "for example ,",
    "the [ o  iii]@xmath5 ew ranges from @xmath6    to undetectable ( @xmath7   ) in the boroson & green ( 1992 ) sample , while the c  iv ew ranges from @xmath8   , to @xmath9    in the same sample ( see below ) . what physical parameter controls the [ o  iii ] ew ? is it mostly density or is it the covering factor of the illuminated narrow line region ( nlr ) gas",
    "? if it is controlled by covering factor variations , then the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4/[o  iii ]  @xmath5 ratio should be independent of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath5 ew .",
    "however , if it is controlled by density variations in the nlr , then the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4/[o  iii ]  @xmath5 ratio should increase with decreasing [ o  iii ]  @xmath5 ew .",
    "we explore these two possibilities below .",
    "to explore the relation of the baldwin effect with @xmath1 and @xmath2  one needs high quality spectra of both the h@xmath3 and the c  iv regions .",
    "we use the boroson & green ( 1992 ) optical spectra of a complete and well defined sample of 87 @xmath0 agn from the bqs sample .",
    "this data set provides us with uniform and systematic estimates of @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "archival uv spectra are available for 85 of the objects ( 47 hst , 38 iue ) , of which 81 have sufficient s / n to measure the c  iv ew , which we measured by fitting each spectrum with 3 gaussian components in the range of @xmath10    to @xmath11   .",
    "the h@xmath3 fwhm and @xmath12 were used for estimating @xmath1 and @xmath2 for each object ( e.g. laor 1998 ) .",
    "the relations of the c  iv ew with @xmath12 and @xmath2 , together with the corresponding spearman rank - order correlation coefficients , are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . the c  iv ew has a significantly tighter relation with @xmath2 than with @xmath12 ( rs increases from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "the correlation with @xmath1 is low ( rs=0.222 , pr=0.047 ) .",
    "we try to further reduce the scatter by including a third parameter describing the optical emission from boroson & green .",
    "the parameter which most significantly improves the correlation with @xmath2 is the [ oiii ] ew ( fig .",
    "2 , left panel ) , which yields rs=-0.733 . other parameters which produce a comparably significant improvement are @xmath15 and the feii / h@xmath3 flux ratio .",
    "recent studies have used the c  iv fwhm , instead of the h@xmath3 fwhm , to estimate @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( vestergaard 2002 ; warner et al .",
    "2003 ) . since the h@xmath3 fwhm and c  iv fwhm are rather poorly correlated , it is not clear whether the c  iv fwhm is a useful substitute to the h@xmath3 fwhm ( when using @xmath12 to estimate the size of the c  iv emitting region ) .",
    "we repeated the correlation analysis above using the c  iv fwhm for a revised @xmath2 estimate ( fig .",
    "2 , right panel ) . the revised @xmath2 yields a low correlation ( rs=-0.192 ) , i.e. no significant improvement over the correlation of the c  iv ew with @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that the c  iv fwhm does not provide an @xmath1 estimate of comparable accuracy to the estimate based on the h@xmath3 fwhm .",
    "to determine whether the near absence of narrow line emission , in particular of the [ o  iii]@xmath5 line , is due to nlr densities above critical , or to a low nlr covering factor , we measure the amount of [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 emission from the same gas which emits the o  iii]@xmath5 line . the critical density of [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 is @xmath16  @xmath17 while the critical density of [ o  iii]@xmath5 is @xmath18  @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4/[o  iii]@xmath5 flux ratio should increase with increasing density in the above range . if the nlr is suppressed by a low covering factor then both [ o  iii ] lines should vary together .",
    "we measure the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 flux using the [ o  iii]@xmath5 profile as a template for the 72 objects where the 4363    region was observed and where [ o  iii]@xmath5 is measureable .",
    "thus , we measure the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 line from gas which has the same velocity distribution as that of the [ o  iii]@xmath5 emitting gas .",
    "the measurements are plotted in figure 3 ( left panel ) together with the theoretical curves of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath5 ew vs. the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 ew as a function of density as calculated using cloudy ( assuming @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xmath21 which optimizes the [ o  iii ] emissivity ) .",
    "these calculations allow us to infer the density and relative covering factor of each object ( fig.3 , right panel ) .",
    "both the density and covering factor appear to have a significant effect on the large range in [ o  iii]@xmath5 ew .",
    "note that the absence of objects at low density and low covering factor is due to the [ o  iii ]  @xmath4 detection limit , while the lack of object at @xmath22  @xmath17 most likely results from the range of nlr densities coupled with the [ o  iii]@xmath5 line emissivity drop above the critical density .",
    "we find the following : 1 . the c  iv ew correlation with luminosity ( the baldwin relation ) appears to be driven mostly by the significantly stronger correlation of the c  iv ew with @xmath2 .",
    "the c  iv ew is also related to the [ o  iii ] ew , @xmath15 , and the fe  ii / h@xmath3 flux ratio .",
    "2 . using the c  iv fwhm instead of the h@xmath3 fwhm to estimate @xmath2 yields only a weak correlation of @xmath2 with the c  iv ew .",
    "this suggests that the c  iv fwhm provides a significantly less accurate measure of @xmath2 , compared to the h@xmath3 fwhm .",
    "3 . both the density and the covering factor appear to contribute significantly to the large range in the [ o  iii]@xmath23 ew in agn .",
