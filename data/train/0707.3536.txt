    "dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces .",
    "hence they are objects of nonarchimedean geometry , a special instance of which is @xmath0-adic geometry .",
    "murtagh @xcite shows how to associate to a dendrogram a set of @xmath0-adic representations of integers .",
    "this lies well within the tradition of using ultrametrics in order to describe the hierarchical ordering in classification ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , there is seemingly a problem in the choice of the prime number @xmath0 for the @xmath0-adic representation of dendrograms by the fact that the geometry of the @xmath0-adic number field @xmath1 allows only at most @xmath0 maximal subclusters of any given cluster .",
    "we will show that this can be overcome by considering finite field extensions of @xmath1 , so that the convenient choice @xmath2 becomes feasible for any dendrogram .",
    "this seems to be compliant with the philosophy of allowing any nonarchimedean complete valued field for describing , coding or computing in data analysis .",
    "we acknowledge here our inspiration by @xcite .",
    "our point of view is in fact of a geometric nature . for a @xmath0-adic geometer ,",
    "a dendrogram is nothing but the affine @xmath0-adic line @xmath3 with @xmath4 punctures from which a certain kind of covering of @xmath3 can be made whose intersection graph is the tree in bijection with the dendrogram from the point of view of data analysis .",
    "completing the affine line to the projective line @xmath5 and then taking an extra puncture @xmath6 , allows us to see the dendrogram as a subtree of the _ bruhat - tits tree _ , which is an important object in the study of @xmath0-adic algebraic curves .",
    "a first application is in the coding of dna sequences @xcite , which is a special case of @xmath0-adic methods for processing strings over a given alphabet , as explained in @xcite , where also new invariants of time series of dendrograms are developped .",
    "it is an imperative from the geometric viewpoint to study families of dendrograms .",
    "for these , there exist already parameter spaces .",
    "in fact , it is now the _",
    "moduli space of genus @xmath7 curves with @xmath4 punctures _",
    "@xmath8 from algebraic geometry which now becomes the central object of interest .",
    "each point of the @xmath0-adic version of @xmath8 is a dendrogram with the extra point @xmath6 .",
    "it is then a natural consequence that a stochastic dendrogram is a continuous family of dendrograms together with a probability distribution on it , or , we can make this now more precise , a map from a @xmath0-adic set of parameters @xmath9 to @xmath8 with a probability distribution on @xmath9 .",
    "we will give an idea of @xmath0-adic spaces by explaining the _ berkovich topology _",
    "one has on these .",
    "due to the ultrametric property , @xmath0-adic spaces in a nave sense are totally disconnected .",
    "this problem can be remedied by introducing extra points which can , in a generalised sense , be viewed as clusters of usual points .    in this framework",
    ", collisions of points in their evolution through time can be formally described by considering the compactification @xmath10 by stable trees of projective lines which we call _ stable dendrograms_. time series of dendrograms , on the other hand , yield ( analytic ) maps @xmath11 between the moduli spaces . further applications of these moduli spaces should be in the study of consensus of dendrograms .",
    "we end by calculating the topology of the _ hidden part _ of a dendrogram , i.e.  the subgraph spanned by vertices corresponding to clusters which do not have singletons as maximal subclusters .",
    "this subgraph determines the distribution of the other clusters , which are `` near the end '' of the dendrogram .",

    "dendrograms are known to be endowed with a nonarchimedean metric , also called an ultrametric , for which the strict triangle inequality @xmath12 holds .",
    "therefore , it is quite tempting to use @xmath0-adic numbers for their description , and in fact , this has recently been done @xcite .",
    "i shall explain this along the example dendrogram of figure [ dendo ] , which is a slight modification of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  1 ) .",
    "choose a prime number @xmath0 , and distribute the @xmath0 numbers @xmath13 across the partitioning of the horizontal line segments defined by the intersection points with vertical line segments of the dendrogram .",
    "for the top horizontal line segment , one has to introduce one extra vertical line segment going upwards , as effected in figure [ dendo ] .",
    "on going down on a path @xmath14 from the top vertical line segment all the way down to one of the points @xmath15 , one picks up the numbers @xmath16 on the traversed horizontal line segments @xmath17 and obtains @xmath18 where @xmath19 runs through all levels of the horizontal parts @xmath17 of the path @xmath14 .    in our example from figure [ dendo ] , we assume @xmath2 , and obtain the numbers @xmath20 note that these dyadic representations differ from the ones in @xcite . in any case",
    ", each path from the top to a bottom end of the dendrogram corresponds to a @xmath0-adic power series representation of an integer number .",
    "the choice of the prime @xmath0 is arbitrary .",
    "however , it might seem that the possible number of vertical segments attached to one horizontal line segment allowing a @xmath0-adic representation of a dendrogram might be bounded by @xmath0 . but",
    "this is not the case .",
    "in fact , one can restrict to the arbitrary choice @xmath2 , if one wishes , and can describe all dendrograms by the help of a little algebra , as will be seen in the following section .",
    "let @xmath1 be the field of @xmath0-adic numbers .",
    "it is a complete nonarchimedean normed field whose norm will be denoted by @xmath21 . consider the unit disk @xmath22 it contains the @xmath0 maximal smaller disks @xmath23 corresponding to the residue field @xmath24 of @xmath1 .",
    "this well known fact is actually a consequence of the construction from the previous section .",
    "it is useful to consider the @xmath0-adic projective line @xmath25 , in which there is the maximal disk outside @xmath26 : @xmath27 due to the ultrametric topology on the @xmath0-adic projective line , the `` closure '' of an `` open '' disk depends somewhat on the choice of a point on its `` boundary '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , we make    let @xmath28 for some @xmath29 and a @xmath0-adic value @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and let @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . the _ affinoid closure of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath6 _ ( resp .  _ to @xmath35 _ ) is the disk @xmath36    using the projective line necessitates the introduction of an equivalence relation on the set of all disks of @xmath37 .",
    "namely , disks @xmath38 , @xmath39 are said to be _ equivalent : _",
    "@xmath40 , if either @xmath41 or the affinoid closure of @xmath42 with respect to some point @xmath43 equals @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "one checks that the relation @xmath44 is indeed an equivalence relation .",
    "the _ bruhat - tits tree _",

    "it is a well known fact that @xmath45 is indeed a tree .",
    "this can be seen directly in this way : each class is obviously represented by a unique disk @xmath34 which is the closure with respect to @xmath47 , and the disks not containing infinity are preordered by inclusion ; so @xmath48 is a directed acyclic graph , hence a tree by the ultrametric property of @xmath21 .",
    "the _ star _ of a vertex @xmath49 in @xmath45 , denoted as @xmath50 , consists of all edges emanating from @xmath49 .",
    "the edges of any star are in one - to - one correspondence with the points of @xmath51 , i.e.  the @xmath24-rational points of the projective line over the residue field @xmath24 .",

    "* bemerkung 5 ) .",

    "5 ) is given in figure [ btt2 ] .    .",
    "]    by construction , the tree @xmath45 is invariant under transformations of the form @xmath55 , with @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "these transformations are called _ projective linear _ or _ mbius transformations _ , and form the group @xmath58 .",
    "the reason for invariance under @xmath58 is the well known fact that mbius transformations take equivalent disks to equivalent disks .",
    "as it may happen that a cluster may have more than @xmath0 maximal subclusters , it would be convenient to be able to represent such dendrograms without enlarging the prime @xmath0 .",
    "so , let @xmath59 be a finite extension field of @xmath1",
    ". the @xmath0-adic norm extends , similarly as in the archimedean case , uniquely to an ultrametric norm @xmath60 on @xmath61 , and @xmath61 is complete with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "such a field @xmath61 is called a _",
    "@xmath0-adic field_.    for a @xmath0-adic field @xmath61 , there is in a similar manner as for @xmath1 a bruhat - tits tree @xmath62 .",
    "again @xmath61 has a finite residue field with @xmath63 elements , and @xmath62 is @xmath64-regular .",
    "therefore , in practical applications it should be possible to stick to the prime @xmath2 and make finite field extensions , if there are clusters with more than @xmath65 children clusters .",
    "again , @xmath66 respects the symmetries of the hierarchical structure of the bruhat - tits tree , i.e.  @xmath62 is invariant under projective linear transformations defined over @xmath61 .    for convenience , we assume now that @xmath67 . however , all what is said in the following is valid also for arbitrary @xmath0-adic fields .",
    "it is well known that any infinite descending chain @xmath68 of strictly smaller disks in @xmath37 converges to a unique point @xmath69 on the @xmath0-adic projective line @xmath37 .",
    "a chain ( [ descendchain ] ) defines a halfline in the bruhat - tits tree @xmath45 .",
    "an _ end _ in a tree is an equivalence class of halflines , where two halflines are said to be equivalent , if they differ only by finitely many edges .",
