    "bouncing cosmologies , in which the universe collapses to a minimum of expansion before returning to expansion , have a long history @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting considerations for such a scenario is whether the matter content of the expanding phase is identical to that of the collapsing phase . in general",
    ", one might expect entropy to increase from one cycle to the next @xcite .",
    "this implies the production of radiation or the creation of black holes , which can be thought of as the objects that have the highest entropy allowed in nature @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider whether black holes can persist through a cosmic bounce , as well as what effect they would have on the large - scale dynamics and on each other",
    ".    one can divide such black holes into two classes : ( i ) those that persist in a universe that recollapses to a big crunch and then bounces into a new expansion phase ; and ( ii ) those that are generated by the high density of matter at the bounce . following ref .",
    "@xcite , these objects will be referred to as `` pre - crunch black holes '' ( pcbhs ) and `` big - crunch black holes '' ( bcbhs ) , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether there would be any observational way of distinguishing them from the primordial black holes ( pbhs ) that formed shortly after the bounce , or during the early stages of the standard hot big bang model without a bounce .",
    "it is also important to know whether black holes really can persist through a bounce in the way that is being envisaged .",
    "the precise properties of a cosmic bounce depend upon the way in which it is generated .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed for this in the long history of the subject .",
    "these include classical effects associated with a cosmological constant @xcite , higher - derivative effects @xcite , or other modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "there are also semi - quantum gravitational effects associated with string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , quantum gravity condensates @xcite , and the `` pre - big - bang '' scenario @xcite . there have also been some claims that scale - invariant fluctuations generated during a cosmological collapse phase could turn into scale - invariant curvature fluctuations after a bounce @xcite , although in a fully quantum gravitational bounce there may be conceptual problems with these approaches @xcite . for a recent review of bouncing cosmologies ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the scalar - field - driven bounces we consider here are probably the simplest models that can accommodate a bounce , and allow us to consider the problem of persistent black holes in an exact and fully relativistic way .    besides the mechanism of the bounce itself , there is also the tricky mathematical issue of what is meant by a black hole in a universe that is not eternally expanding .",
    "this issue is further complicated by the lack of any asymptotic spatial infinity in most cosmological models . for a pbh that forms after the big bang",
    ", it is usually understood that the black hole singularity is part of any future big crunch singularity ( if one should occur ) . however",
    ", this can not apply to pcbhs or bcbhs if the cosmological bounce is non - singular . without knowledge of the location of the black hole singularities",
    "it is impossible to locate the event horizon , which is defined as the boundary of the past of future null infinity .",
    "a more satisfactory approach is therefore to use the concept of the black hole apparent horizon , which is defined as the outermost marginally outer trapped surface ( mots ) @xcite , and will be used throughout this study",
    ".    a further matter of interest for models of this type concerns what happens to the number density of black holes as the minimum of expansion is approached .",
    "one could speculate about the maximum fraction of space that can be filled by pcbhs or about the number of bcbhs that form during the collapsing stage .",
    "these quantities would depend on the maximum density of matter that occurs at the bounce , and there are then various interesting constraints that can be imposed on the fraction of the universe s mass density that resides in black holes as a function of mass @xcite . if the black holes are randomly distributed , one would expect a process of hierarchical merging to occur , in which progressively larger apparent horizons form around groups of holes , so that the characteristic hole size steadily increases . alternatively ,",
    "if the holes were distributed in a uniform fashion then pre - crunch hierarchical merger would be eliminated , and one could investigate the maximum number of black holes that could fit through a given bounce .    in this paper , we study this scenario in detail by considering models that contain a regular lattice of black holes and a scalar field at the maximum compression .",
    "these restrictions are primarily motivated by mathematical simplicity , as we find that they yield a number of exact solutions to the einstein constraint equations .",
    "the associated initial data then prescribe a unique evolution in both the expansion and collapse directions .",
    "they therefore constitute a proper cosmological model .",
    "although in general the evolution will need to be determined numerically , the initial data itself can be used to analyse a number of the problems outlined above .",
    "in particular , the positions of the apparent horizons can be determined and used to calculate the distance between neighbouring black holes .",
    "this information can be used to determine the fraction of space that is filled by black holes as a function of the maximum energy density at the bounce .",
    "it also unambiguously demonstrates that black holes can persist through a cosmological bounce .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2 we derive the form of the constraint equations in a time - symmetric scalar field - dominated model , focussing particularly on the geometry of the spatial hypersurface at the bounce .",
    "in secs .  3 and 4 we consider black holes in hyperspherical and spatially flat cosmological models , respectively .",
    "in sec .  5 we consider black holes in higher - dimensional bouncing cosmologies , a possibility also emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "6 we draw some general conclusions . appendix  a discusses solutions for the initial data in which the scalar field is stationary at the maximum compression , these relating to multiple janis - newman - winicour - like black hole solutions .",
    "appendix  b discusses solutions with a non - vanishing scalar potential .",
    "in this section we will present the einstein field equations ( efes ) in the presence of radiation and a scalar field , as relevant for studying the geometry of space - time in the vicinity of a bounce .",
    "this follows from the standard approach of using a scalar field in early - universe friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology in order to model the effects of new physics . in our case , however , we will not assume anything about the existence of global symmetries ( approximate or otherwise ) .",
    "instead , we will give the general form for the constraint and evolution equations , and describe how a bouncing cosmology with black holes can be formulated as an initial value problem , with initial data prescribed at the bounce .",
    "just as in standard flrw cosmology , the scalar field may be expected to dominate at early times but become negligible compared to the energy and momentum in radiation and dust at late times .",
    "this means that if one considers a regular array of black holes and a scalar field , the late - time evolution of the space might approach that of a space just containing an array of black holes ( i.e. the space should forget that it once contained a dominant scalar field ) .",
    "this is mathematically very interesting , because for a scalar field with a negative coupling constant there exists a time - symmetric initial value problem for an array of black holes which expand away from each other as the space evolves from the time - symmetric surface .",
    "the existence of time symmetry means that the constraint equations on the initial surface can be manipulated into a linear form , allowing for the initial data for arbitrary many black holes to be constructed by simple superposition .",
    "let us consider the efes with a scalar field : [ fe ] g_ab = t^_ab + t^_ab , where @xmath0 is a coupling constant ( necessarily negative for a bounce ) and we have chosen units with @xmath1 . the quantity @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field , and is given by t^_ab = _ a _ b - g_ab _ c ^c - g_ab v ( ) , where @xmath3 is the scalar potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor of an additional radiation fluid , which is assumed to be separately conserved .",
    "the contracted second bianchi identity then gives the scalar propagation equation as [ boxvarphi ] = , where @xmath5 is the covariant dalembertian operator .",
    "if we now choose a time - like vector field , @xmath6 , we can decompose @xmath2 into energy density , isotropic pressure and momentum density : [ rho ] ^ & & u^a u^b t^_ab = ^2 + d^a d_a + v ( ) + [ p ] p^ & & h^ab t^_ab = ^2 - d^a d_a -v ( ) + [ j ] j_a^ & & - h_a^ b u^c t^_bc = - d_a . here an over - dot denotes @xmath7 , and we have introduced @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the projection operator and the projected covariant derivative on the set of spaces orthogonal to @xmath6 . likewise , the energy density and isotropic pressure of a perfect fluid of radiation are given by ^ & & u^a u^b t^_ab , p^ h^ab t^_ab , where @xmath10 and the momentum density is @xmath11 ( by virtue of the fluid being radiation and perfect , respectively ) .",
    "using the appropriate embedding equations , together with the efes ( [ fe ] ) , we can write the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations for the space - time as [ hc ] & & + k^2 - k_ab k^ab = 2 u^a u^b g_ab = 2 ^ + 2 ^ + [ mc ] & & d_b k^b _ a - d_a k = - h^b _ a u^c g_bc = j_a^ , where @xmath12 is the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface we are considering , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the ricci scalar of this hypersurface ( assuming @xmath6 is irrotational ) .",
    "these equations must be satisfied on the initial hypersurface , in order to have a solution to the efes .",
    "the corresponding evolution equations for the geometry will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : time ] below .",
    "it now remains to decompose the conservation equations for the scalar field and radiation fluids .",
    "for the radiation field this yields [ radcon ] d_a ^ + 4 ^ _ a = 0 , ^ = k ^ as the constraint and evolution equations for @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "here we have chose a @xmath6 that is comoving with the radiation fluid . for the scalar field , the propagation equation ( [ boxvarphi ] ) can be decomposed into evolution and constraint equations with respect to the vector field @xmath6 . to do this ,",
    "we first define [ varphivar ] _ a d_a .",
    "we can then decompose eq .",
    "( [ boxvarphi ] ) into the following first - order evolution equations : [ evo1 ] & = & d_a ^a+ k + _ a ^a + v^ ( ) + _ a & = & d_a + _ a + u_a ^b _ b + & = & , [ evo3 ] where the last of these defines the quantity @xmath16 .",
    "( [ varphivar ] ) is then the only constraint equation , while eqs .",
    "( [ evo1])-([evo3 ] ) constitute the evolution equations for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this completes our formulation of the initial value problem in terms of constraint and evolution equations , as required for this study .",
    "let us now consider time - symmetric initial data .",
    "in this case the initial data must satisfy @xmath19 . from eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) and ( [ mc ] ) , this immediately implies d_a = 0 , so that either @xmath20 or @xmath21 or both on the initial hyper - surface . if both are true , then the scalar field evolution equations show that @xmath22 at all points in space and time , which is the trivial case in which there is no scalar field .",
    "the case where @xmath20 is considered in the appendices . if @xmath23 , then initial data of this type can be shown to include cosmological solutions with multiple janis - newman - winicour - like black holes ( see appendix a ) .",
    "if @xmath3 is an exponential function , then exact solutions can also be found ( see appendix b ) . however , the remaining case , where @xmath21 , is a more interesting one for cosmology and will form the basis of the study that follows .    if @xmath24 , then @xmath18 is constant on the initial hypersurface and we can infer from eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "time - symmetry on the initial hypersurface then requires @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as we require @xmath29 in order to have a non - vacuum solution , the time - symmetry condition implies @xmath30 , which is compatible with the scalar field evolution equation ( [ evo1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we therefore have a solution where @xmath18 is initially homogeneous but @xmath31 is inhomogeneous and @xmath32 vanishes .",
    "we are also forced to require @xmath33 to be a constant , so that it acts like a cosmological constant .",
    "we therefore neglect @xmath33 in what follows , as the cosmological constant is not expected to play an important role near the time of the bounce .    the remaining equation that needs to be satisfied in order to have a solution to the einstein - scalar system is the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hc ] ) .",
    "when @xmath34 , this can be written as [ constraintr ] = ^2 + 2 ^ .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is not involved in the scalar field constraint equation and can therefore be specified freely .",
    "once we have a solution for the geometry of an initial hypersurface that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ constraintr ] ) for a given @xmath16 , we have a complete solution to all the constraint equations and hence the full initial data required to determine the entire evolution .    to find explicit solutions with constant conformal curvature , let us make the following ansatz for the line - element of the time - symmetric initial hypersurface : [ le ] ds^2 = ^4 d|s^2 , where @xmath35 is the line - element for a 3-space of constant curvature .",
    "standard results from conformal geometry then give [ conformal ] = - |d^2 , where @xmath36constant is the ricci scalar of the conformal space and @xmath37 is the covariant derivative on the conformal space . combining eqs .",
    "( [ constraintr ] ) and ( [ conformal ] ) then gives [ constraint ] |d^2 - = - ^5 . if @xmath38 , so that we are considering a vacuum space - time , then this equation is linear in @xmath39 , which is promising if we are interested in looking for a multi - black hole solution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) is not linear in @xmath18 , it can be made so by a suitable choice of @xmath16 .",
    "it is this equation that we will use to solve for black holes in a hyperspherical cosmology in section [ sec : sphere ] , in a spatially flat cosmology in section [ sec : flat ] and in a higher - dimensional cosmology in section [ sec : higher ] . given the efes , it can be seen that we can only obtain a bounce when the matter source violates the null energy conditions ( e.g. when @xmath40 and @xmath23 , which describes a massless scalar field with a negative energy density ) .",
    "however , bounces can be more naturally obtained with normal matter in modified gravity theories @xcite .      in subsequent sections we will present exact solutions of the constraint equation ( [ constraint ] ) that can be used to develop an exact 4-dimensional dynamical solutions of the efes . these solutions , while highly idealised , describe realisations of the scenario in which multiple distinct black holes persist through a cosmological bounce .",
    "therefore , they both demonstrate the existence of solutions that could be generalised to more realistic models and provide space - time geometries in which specific computations can be made .",
    "however , in order to study the full time - evolution of these models we need to solve the full efes and not just the conservation and constraint equations .",
    "let us choose coordinates so that the full 4-dimensional space - time is given by the following line - element : [ dynmetric ] ds^2 = -a^2(t , x^ ) dt^2 + h _",
    "( t , x^ ) dx^ dx^. an evolving solution would be a metric of this form solving both the constraint and the evolution equations . for a dynamical model with a bounce at the time - symmetic surface at @xmath41 ,",

    "we therefore have [ hypmetric ] h _ ( t_0,x^ )",

    "the initial value problem is well - posed , once appropriate initial values for the metric and extrinsic curvature functions have been specified , we are guaranteed a unique solution . in general , this will need to be obtained numerically @xcite-@xcite , although approximate solutions may also be possible @xcite-@xcite .    at this point , to fix ideas , it may be useful to compare the inhomogeneous models we are constructing to analogous flrw models .",
    "for an isotropic and spatially homogeneous geometry , we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the scale factor that describes the cosmic evolution in its entirety . in the massless scalar field",
    "flrw models with dust , radiation , and spatial curvature there can of course exists a bounce , and the corresponding solution for @xmath47 can be easily obtained . in the absence of energy exchange between these fluids ,",
    "the bounce at @xmath41 is generically expected to be time - symmetric .",
    "this means that at the minimum of the bounce , the geometry described by the conformal factor @xmath48 is instantaneously static .",
    "the time - symmetric initial data we considered above is the generalisation of this situation to inhomogeneous space - times that are capable of harbouring black holes . just as the flrw solution moves away from the minimum of expansion into a regular phase of expansion",
    ", we expect our initial data to evolve into a regular universe in which the scalar field dilutes , and the radiation and dust fields eventually come to dominate .",
    "that is , a set of instantaneously static initial data should not be expected to lead to a static space - time , but rather a dynamical cosmological model .",
    "this will be explained further in the sections that follow .",
    "let us start by considering hyperspherical cosmological models .",
    "we study this first not because it is more likely to be associated with a bounce , but because it is mathematically simpler when formulated in terms of an initial value problem . for a hyperspherical cosmology , we take the conformal line - element in eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) to be [ hs ] d|s^2 = dr^2 + ^2 r ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) .",
    "the scalar curvature of this space is @xmath49 , so the hamiltonian constraint ( [ constraint ] ) becomes |d^2 = ( - ( ^2 + 2 ^ ) ^4 ) .",
    "[ ham ] if we now choose the initial value of @xmath16 such that [ c ] ^2 = ( - ) - , where @xmath50 is a constant , then the constraint equation becomes [ helmholtz ] |d^2 = , so that @xmath51 if both @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "this is the helmholtz equation on a 3-sphere , which has well - known solutions .",

    "these solutions diverge at @xmath56 , which we take to be the location of the source . in order for the geometry of the space to be smooth at all other points ,",
    "we require the first derivative of @xmath39 to be single - valued . applying this condition at @xmath57 implies @xmath58 ,",
    "so eq . ( [ omi ] ) gives [ cont0 ] _",
    "i(r ) = _ i .",
    "this equation gives the contribution to the conformal factor for a single point - like source at @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath59 sources , located at arbitrary positions on the hypersphere , we can write the corresponding solution as [ cont ] ( r , , ) = _ i=1^n _ i , where @xmath60 should be understood as the radial coordinate in eq .",

    "* one number to be specified for each black hole ( @xmath54 ) . * a single number ( @xmath50 ) that sets the magnitude of the scalar field energy density . * a single number ( @xmath0 ) for the coupling strength of the scalar field .",
    "it now remains to determine the relationship between the constants @xmath54 , and the proper mass of each of the sources .      to determine the proper mass of one of the sources , we start by taking the @xmath63 limit of eq .",
