    "developments in string theory have inspired the construction of brane - worlds , in which standard - model gauge fields are confined to our three - dimensional brane - world , while gravity propagates in all the spatial dimensions .",
    "a simple five - dimensional class of such models allows for a non - compact extra dimension via a novel mechanism for localization of gravity around the brane at low energies@xcite .",
    "this mechanism is the warping of the metric by a negative five - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "these models have been generalized to admit cosmological branes  @xcite , and they provide an interesting arena in which to impose cosmological tests on extra - dimensional generalizations of einstein s theory .",
    "one of the unusual features of this structure is that brane - worlds can feel the effects of non - local anisotropic stresses in the bulk dimensions .",
    "these graviton stresses are unconstrained by dynamical equations specified on the brane but for a wide range of behaviours they completely determine the evolution of small anisotropies on the brane - world and can slow the their decay to such an extent that their effects are directly detectable today in the temperature anisotropy of the microwave background radiation@xcite . the evolution of anisotropic brane - worlds has been studied recently by several authors @xcite .",
    "they consider only the behaviour of simple anisotropies in universes with perfect fluid matter sources .",
    "however , it is known that the evolution of simple anisotropic universes with isotropic three - curvature is very sensitive to the presence of trace - free matter sources with anisotropic pressures , @xcite .",
    "such stresses are inevitable in anisotropic cosmologies at early times because of the presence of collisionless gravitons , collisionless asymptotically - free particles , and electric or magnetic fields .",
    "these stresses also mimic the effects of more general anisotropic curvature anisotropies in more general anisotropic universe ( because the latter can be viewed as an effective stress of long - wavelength gravitational waves ) .",
    "small anisotropic pressures serve to slow the decay of the shear anisotropy to a logarithm of the time during the radiation era and to a slow power law during the dust era .",
    "these anisotropic stresses can arise because of intrinsic anisotropic stresses on the brane or via the induced graviton stresses from the bulk . in this paper",
    "we are going to consider the detailed behaviour of the simplest example : a pure magnetic field on a flat anisotropic brane with bianchi type i geometry . whereas the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was interested in the late - time behaviour we shall be interested primarily in the behaviour as @xmath0    the possibility of isotropization and homogenisation of cosmological models have been an important study since the original equations for gravitational interaction where put down in 1915 by einstein .",
    "the general relativistic anisotropic models called the bianchi models have been studied in great detail both in general relativistic cosmologies @xcite and to some extent in the brane - world scenario . a feature that has been known to exist in the bianchi models are oscillatory solutions@xcite , and even chaotic solutions @xcite .",
    "the chaotic behaviour in the general relativistic vacuum bianchi type viii and ix models has been well studied , and chaotic behaviour for the general relativistic bianchi type i model with a magnetic field has been conjectured @xcite and studied for the case of form fields @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    in the brane - worlds model",
    "the dynamics change because of the influence of terms varying as the square of the isotropic and anisotropic pressure as @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate the bianchi type i brane - world with a perfect fluid and a pure magnetic field in the context of a possible chaotic behaviour .",
    "this extends the general relativistic study by leblanc @xcite to the brane - world scenario .",
    "we will show that unlike the general relativity case , chaotic behaviour is probably completely absent for all perfect fluids as a result of the non - linear stresses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first we put down the fundamental equations of motion .",
    "we use the representation of leblanc to facilitate comparisons , and introduce expansion - normalized variables . since we are primarily interested in the initial singularity , we find some approximate solutions near the initial singularity for different magnetic configurations .",
    "all of these approximate solutions correspond to equilibrium points for the full set of equations , and so we provide a stability analysis of the equilibrium points found .",
    "the bianchi cosmological models can be classified according to the commutation relations of their invariant 1-forms , @xmath2 .",
    "we will use an orthonormal frame of vector fields @xmath3 , and align the frame so that @xmath4 , the fluid vector field .",
    "this implies that the spatial triad @xmath5 spans the tangent space at each point of the group orbits . using the commutation relations for this vector basis , the commutator functions @xmath6 are given by @xmath7=c_{~\\alpha \\beta } ^\\gamma ( t)e_\\gamma \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the bianchi class a case we have the relations @xmath8 the @xmath9 are the frame components of the volume expansion tensor of the fluid , or the extrinsic curvature .",

    "the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 is separated into its trace , @xmath12 , the volume expansion , and its trace - free part @xmath13 the shear : @xmath14 we will also assume that we have a non - zero electromagnetic ( em ) field and a non - interacting perfect fluid .",
    "the perfect - fluid energy momentum tensor is @xmath15 further , we will assume a barotropic equation of state for the fluid for the pressure @xmath16 and density @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 $ ] is constant .",
    "the perfect fluid solves the usual conservation equation @xmath20    the energy - momentum tensor of the em field can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy density and the isotropic pressure , respectively , and the tensor @xmath24 projects orthogonal to the @xmath25 on the brane , and @xmath26 is the tracefree anisotropic pressure tensor . in the case of an electric field @xmath27 and magnetic field @xmath28 the energy - momentum tensor can be written in general as @xmath29 where the anisotropic stress is @xmath30 and the pressure and density are given by @xmath31 demanding that the perfect fluid and the em field be separately conserved requires eqn .",
    "( [ con ] ) @xmath32    for a bianchi type i model the commutator between the vectors of the spatial triad all commute so @xmath33 this allows us to have a pure magnetic field@xcite .",
    "this is not the case for all bianchi models .",
    "we shall therefore specialise to the case of a bianchi type i model with a vanishing electric field .",

    "the dark energy , @xmath34 ( which can in principle be of either sign ) on the other hand can not be set to zero in the presence of a non - zero anisotropic stress .",
    "in addition to these equations the magnetic field satisfies maxwell s equations : @xmath51 since we shall be concerned with the early time behaviour we can ask if there is an initial singularity . in the brane - world",
    "we can write the energy - momentum tensor as a sum of the classical energy - momentum tensor and a term that come from brane - effects only .",
    "a sufficient condition for a singularity is that the classical energy - momentum tensor obeys the strong energy condition ( sec ) , _ and _ that @xmath52 .",
    "we must however emphasize that we can still have a singularity even if this condition is violated .",
    "the equations in the orthonormal frame reduce to the following first - order system : @xmath53 we still have an unused gauge freedom to choose the orientation of the spatial triad .",
    "we choose the orientation so that the magnetic field is aligned with @xmath54 , thus ensuring @xmath55 while @xmath56 . from the maxwell equations for @xmath57",
    "this yields the constraints @xmath58 the @xmath59 is still left undetermined , but to simplify the equations we will choose a frame so that @xmath60 .",

    "we have the term @xmath144 .",
    "let us assume that this is the case here .",
    "for this to happen we clearly require @xmath145 on the other hand , the shear has to be exponentially decreasing in @xmath77 as we go towards the initial singularity , so @xmath146 but from the @xmath139 term , we get an even stronger bound : @xmath147 the physical explanation for this bound in order that the solutions to be stable in the past is evident : if the perfect fluid dominates the past singularity , it inevitably drives the universe towards isotropy . near isotropy",
