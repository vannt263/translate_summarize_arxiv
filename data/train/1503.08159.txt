    "the same line of argument should yield a version of the theorem ( with constants altered appropriately ) corresponding to any reasonable decomposition of a map into submaps of higher connectivity .",

    "as far as i am aware , the fact that the combinatorics of maps always lead to @xmath157 fluctuations and airy - type limits is thus far an empirical fact rather than a provable necessity . )",
    "the paper @xcite is a @xmath159-page beast , so one may reasonably be skeptical that a proof which relies upon it can be called a `` simplification '' of anything . here",
    "are two responses .",
    "first , the result from @xcite that we use , namely theorem 19.34 , is self - contained ; its proof is only 4 pages long , is elementary and probabilistic , and does not rely on results from elsewhere in the paper .",
    "second , our reference to @xcite could be removed by appealing to theorem 1 of @xcite ( using ( 2.7 ) from@xcite to control @xmath158 ) ; its ( probabilistic ) proof totals under two pages .",
    "( however , the language in @xcite is closer to that of the current paper , which makes it slightly easier to apply . )",
    "list the blocks of @xmath103 in decreasing order of size ( number of edges ) as @xmath160 , breaking ties arbitrarily . by proposition  [ samelaw ]",
    ", the sequence @xmath161 has the same law as the decreasing rearrangement of non - zero outdegrees in @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath162 be the decreasing rearrangement of @xmath163 .",
    "by corollary  [ deglaw ] , it follows that for all @xmath87 we have @xmath164 the largest values of such collections of random variables have been studied in detail by janson @xcite .",
    "many of the results are phrased in terms of statistics of random balls - into - boxes configurations ; the connection between this and outdegrees in conditioned galton - watson trees is made explicit in section 8 of @xcite .",
    "one of the themes running through that work is that of _ condensation _ : for heavy - tailed random variables , conditioning a sum @xmath165 to be large is often equivalent to conditioning on having a single exceptionally large summand ; furthermore , once the largest summand is removed , the remaining @xmath166 summands are asymptotically distributed as iid random variables with their original distribution .",
    "see @xcite for other instances of this phenomenon in related settings .    in the setting of this paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 19.34 ( iv ) , ( vi ) ) provides local limit theorems for the sizes of @xmath167 , for any @xmath151 . verifying the conditions of that theorem are straightforward .",
    "first , the values of @xmath115 and @xmath168 imply that @xmath169 . furthermore , as @xmath170 , by stirling s formula we have @xmath171 finally , the moment generating function of @xmath172 clearly has radius of convergence @xmath173 . in the notation of @xcite",
    ", this says that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",

    "* theorem 19.34 ) , respectively , then give that @xmath178 and for @xmath151 , @xmath179 in view of the explicit expression for @xmath180 , this proves the theorem .    here",
    "are two final remarks .",
    "first , as mentioned above , the paper @xcite proves a local limit theorem for @xmath158 , with explicit error bounds in the rate of convergence . it would be interesting to recover such bounds by probabilistic methods .",
    "second , that paper also proves essentially sharp bounds for the upper and lower tail probabilities of @xmath158 ; see theorems 1 and 5 .",
    "similar tail bounds should apply in the more general settings of @xcite .",
    "this seems like a fundamental question in large deviations of functions of iid random variables .",
    "the main result of @xcite seems quite pertinent , but pertains specifically to sums rather than to more general functions .",
