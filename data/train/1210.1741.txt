    "island , in physical geography , a term generally definable as a piece of land surrounded by water .",
    "( encyclopdia britannica , eleventh edition , volume xiv , cambridge university press 1910 . ) mathematical models of this definition were introduced and studied by several authors .",
    "these investigations utilized tools from different areas of mathematics , e.g. combinatorics , coding theory , lattice theory , analysis , fuzzy mathematics .",
    "our goal is to provide a general setting that unifies these approaches .",
    "this general framework encompasses prime implicants of boolean functions and concepts of a formal context as special cases , and it has close connections to graph theory and to proximity spaces .    the notion of an island as a mathematical concept occurred first in czdli @xcite , where a rectangular board was considered with a real number assigned to each cell of the board , representing the height of that cell . a set @xmath0 of cells forming a rectangle is called an _ island ,",
    "if the minimum height of @xmath0 is greater then the height of any cell around the perimeter of @xmath0 , since in this case @xmath0 can become a piece of land surrounded by water after a flood producing an appropriate water level .",
    "the motivation to investigate such islands comes from foldes and singhi @xcite , where islands on a @xmath1 board ( so - called full segments ) played a key role in characterizing maximal instantaneous codes .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that the maximum number of islands on an @xmath2 board is @xmath3 .",
    "however , the size of a system of islands ( i.e. , the collection of all islands appearing for given heights ) that is maximal with respect to inclusion ( not with respect to cardinality ) can be as low as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another important observation of @xcite is that any two islands are either comparable ( i.e. one is contained in the other ) or disjoint ; moreover , disjoint islands can not be too close to each other ( i.e. they can not have neighboring cells ) .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that these properties actually characterize systems of islands .",
    "we refer to such a result as a dry  characterization , since it describes systems of islands in terms of intrinsic conditions , without referring to heights and water levels .",
    "the above mentioned paper @xcite of gbor czdli was a starting point for many investigations exploring several variations and various aspects of islands .",
    "square islands on a rectangular board have been considered in @xcite , and islands have been studied also on cylindrical and toroidal boards @xcite , on triangular boards @xcite , on higher dimensional rectangular boards @xcite as well as in a continuous setting @xcite . if we allow only a given finite subset of the reals as possible heights , then the problem of determining the maximum number of islands becomes considerably more difficult ; see , e.g. @xcite . islands also appear naturally as cuts of lattice - valued functions @xcite ; furthermore , order - theoretic properties of systems of islands proved to be of interest on their own , and they have been investigated in lattices and partially ordered sets @xcite .",
    "the notion of an island is an elementary combinatorial concept , yet it leads immediately to open problems , therefore it is a suitable topic to introduce students to mathematical research @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a general framework for islands that subsumes all of the earlier studied concepts of islands on finite boards .",
    "we will axiomatize those situations where islands have the comparable or disjoint  property mentioned above , and we will also present dry characterizations of systems of islands .",
    "our landscape is given by a nonempty base set @xmath5 , and a function @xmath6 that assigns to each point @xmath7 its height @xmath8 . if the minimum height @xmath9 of a set @xmath10 is greater than the height of its surroundings , then @xmath0 can become an island if the water level is just below @xmath11 . to make this more precise ,",
    "let us fix two families of sets @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the power set of @xmath5 .",
    "we do not allow islands of arbitrary shapes : only sets belonging to @xmath14 are considered as candidates for being islands , and the members of @xmath15 describe the surroundings  of these sets .",

    "in particular , one could assume without loss of generality that the range of @xmath45 is contained in the set @xmath46 .",
    "many of the previously studied island concepts can be interpreted in terms of graphs as follows .",

    "the second item of remark  [ remark basic ] applies , hence pre - islands and islands are the same . let us assume that @xmath50 is connected , and let @xmath14 consist of the connected convex sets of vertices .",
    "( a set is called convex if it contains all shortest paths between any two of its vertices . )",
    "if @xmath50 is a path , then the islands are exactly the full segments considered in @xcite , and if @xmath50 is a square grid ( the product of two paths ) , then we obtain the rectangular islands of @xcite .",
    "square islands on a rectangular board @xcite , islands on cylindrical and toroidal boards @xcite , on triangular boards @xcite and on higher dimensional rectangular boards @xcite also fit into this setting .    surprisingly , formal concepts and prime implicants are also pre - islands in disguise .",

    "how can we find such a height function ( if there is one ) ? concerning the first question , we give a dry  characterization of systems of pre - islands corresponding to connective island domains in theorem  [ thm i d = = > ( ha<==>sz ) ] , and in corollary  [ cor pd = = > ( distant<==>strsz ) ] we characterize systems of islands corresponding to so - called _ proximity domains _ ( see definition  [ def proximity domain ] ) .",
