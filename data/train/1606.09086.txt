    "observations have confirmed that a significant number of pne indeed have binary central stars @xcite .",
    "since binarity precedes the formation of the pn , it is paramount to detect it along previous phases of stellar evolution before the pn formation , particularly at the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "an unbiased comparison among the binarity occurrence rates during the main sequence , agb and pn phases can help to reinforce a causality relationship between binarity and the formation of aspherical pne and to assess the evolution of binary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* )    binary or multiple systems including agb stars have been often observed as symbiotic systems .",
    "they are identified by their spectra , which includes features characteristic of the red giant as well as emission lines arising from the wind - driven atmosphere of the giant , which is ionized by the uv photons of the secondary white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the latest catalogue of symbiotic systems contains about two hundred objects , including confirmed and suspected objects @xcite .",
    "the discovery of hot companions of agb stars is somewhat straightforward where they compose symbiotic systems , but the detection of low- and intermediate - mass main - sequence ( hereafter ms ) companions is not simple .",
    "the detection of the secondary in direct images is difficult because the high brightness contrast between them hampers the detection of the secondary , except in the cases where the components are well resolved @xcite . indeed , the recent advent of new generation adaptive optics systems has allowed the detection of late - type , close companions of agb stars @xcite , but this method still remains restricted to a few near objects @xcite .",
    "other methods to detect binary agb stars include asymmetries in their circumstellar envelopes @xcite , proper - motion variations @xcite , and the identification of features attributed to the secondary in the visual spectrum @xcite .    as a rule , the shorter the wavelength , the higher the relative contribution of the hot component to the spectrum because the flux emitted by an agb star decreases abruptly beyond @xmath22800   .",
    "therefore , uv space observatories ( _ fuse _ , _ galex _ , _ hst _ ) have greatly increased the possibilities to detect ms companions of agb stars .",
    "@xcite have carried out a program in quest of binary agb stars based on an imaging survey obtained by the _ galex _ observatory ( _ galaxy evolution explorer , _ * ? ? ?",
    "they selected 25 agb stars showing m5 or later spectral type classified during the mission as `` bright star '' and `` high - background '' , with the additional criterium that they should exhibit the `` multiplicity '' flag in the catalogue .",
    "these were considered as promising conditions to detect companions with spectral type earlier than g0 in the two _ galex _ photometric bands : far - uv ( @xmath3  ) and near - uv ( @xmath4  ) .",
    "indeed , uv counterparts were detected in most of the sources and for a significant fraction of them the uv emission seemed to be in excess , i.e.  it probably results from a companion undetected at visual wavelengths .",
    "these results have undoubtfully made a major contribution in increasing the number of known binary agb stars , but these searches have mostly been biased towards the most promising candidates and/or been restricted to symbiotic systems . in this paper",
    "we address the problem of detecting ms companions of agb stars using _ galex _ uv data .",
    "the issues explored in this study will pave the way for future unbiased determinations of the occurrence of binarity among agb stars .",
    "the main scopes of the present paper are : ( 1 ) to establish the detection limits of the _ galex _ survey to detect ms companions of agb binary stars ( sect .",
    "[ detect ] and [ method ] ) ; ( 2 ) to derive criteria for selecting binary agb star candidates , to be eventually confirmed by other techniques , e.g.  radial velocity ( rv ) studies ( sect .  [ results ] ) ; and ( 3 ) to assess the stellar properties of these companions , mainly their effective temperature ( sect .",
    "[ discussion ] ) .",
    "the detection of the ms secondary companion of an agb star depends on the contrast between its flux and that of the primary .",
    "the detectability of a ms intermediate or early spectral type companion using uv photometry is feasible because , despite the high luminosity of the primary , its flux bluewards of 2800   is usually negligible when compared to the flux emitted by the secondary .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimated a secondary - to - primary _ galex _ near - uv flux contrast ratio @xmath510 for a ms secondary star with spectral type earlier than g0 ( or @xmath6 k ) .    besides the flux contrast between the two components , the detectability depends also on the distance to the system as it determines the uv flux .",
    "this issue was extensively addressed by @xcite for hot objects .",
    "assuming theoretical atmosphere models , they conclude that _ galex _ could detect all wd in the galactic halo along their constant - luminosity phase ( i.e.  wd s with @xmath7 k and radii down to @xmath8 ) up to a distance of 20 kpc . concerning _ galex _",
    "detections of ms stars , @xcite focused on objects with @xmath9 k , thus excluding intermediate - mass stars .",
    "_ galex _ observation strategy was mainly organized into three different modes , namely ais , mis and dis , mostly different by their varying exposure times of 100 s , 1500 s , and 30,000 s , respectively .",
    "these modes refer to specific areas in the sky called _ tiles .",
    "_ most observations were made in the ais mode to cover large areas in the sky .",
    "for each entry the _ galex _ catalogue gives , among other information , the magnitude and flux density in the near- and far - uv bands @xcite .",
    "an analysis of sources registered in different mode tiles shows that there are significant differences in sensitivity among them : sources detected with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath10 of 5 have fluxes 10 @xmath11jy @xmath12 20 @xmath11jy in ais tiles , going down to 5 @xmath11jy @xmath12 10 @xmath11jy in mis tiles given their longer integration time .    in order to calculate the limiting distances of ms stars detectable by _ galex",

    "the behaviour of the interstellar extinction coefficients was exhaustively studied by @xcite who analysed thousands of stars detected by _ galex _ ( and other surveys ) in several directions in the galaxy . in the present study",

    "contrary to naive expectations , only hotter stars with @xmath48 k ( spectral type f2 or earlier , i.e.  mainly ms stars of spectral types o , b and a ) could be detected in the far - uv band due to its lower sensitivity .",
    "the latter stars are less frequently companions of agb stars because of the steep slope of the initial - mass function .",
    "the method used here for estimating the uv excess of agb stars has much in common with that proposed by @xcite , and has been partially described in sect .",

    "the standard values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 of 0.26 , 0.15 and 0.09 for the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands , respectively , are adopted @xcite . since @xmath55 mag in most cases ,",
    "the assumption of an alternative reddening law would not change the results significantly .",
    "secondly , the extinction - corrected flux densities corresponding to these five photometric bands are calculated using equation  [ fx ] .",
    "these are then fitted with the least - squared method to the theoretical spectral library by @xcite assuming [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "no photometric bands redwards of @xmath52 are considered in these fits because agb stars may have circumstellar dust envelopes that produce an infrared excess in this spectral region .",
    "the average magnitude residuals considering the 5 bands is typically less than 0.2 mag , which is considerably smaller than the amplitude of variability of the stars .",
    "once the best - fit spectrum has been found , its flux density in the _ galex _ near - uv and far - uv bands is calculated using equation  [ fx ] .",
    "this latter step deserves a warning .",
    "since the agb stellar spectrum in this spectral region is very steep and the _ galex _ photometric bands are broad , the flux densities @xmath56 and @xmath57 obtained by convolving the theoretical spectrum with the filter curve are dominated by the stellar contribution on the longest wavelength side of the band . as a result ,",
    "the flux densities differ notably , about two orders of magnitude , from the value of the flux at the effective wavelength @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .    finally , the ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the extinction - corrected ( using equation [ fnuv ] ) _ galex _ @xmath56 and @xmath57 to the predicted @xmath56 and @xmath57 are computed .",

    "@xcite comment that only 1.1% of the stars in the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits @xcite are m - type giants .",
    "indeed , most of the binary systems known to contain a red giant are symbiotic , whereas systems with a non - degenerate companion are scarce .",
    "@xcite used a series of radial velocity measurements obtained with the coravel spectrovelocimeter @xcite to determine the binarity status of a number of stars .",
    "binarity was flagged as _ orb _ when the set of kinematic measurements allowed the determination of the orbit , _ orb : _ when the orbit was poorly determined , _ sb _ when binarity was confirmed spectroscopically , but no orbit could be computed from the data , _ sb ? _ when the binarity is only suspected , and _ non - sb _ when binarity is discarded .",
    "our sample of confirmed binary agb stars was extracted from the work by @xcite , with the following main additional criteria : ( a ) the star should be classified as _ orb _ , _ orb : _ or _ sb _ ; ( b ) concerning variability , the star must be classified as mira ( a _ long - period variable _ or lpv ) , sr- ( _ semi - regular _ ) or l - type ( _ slow irregular variable _ ) . the former criterium is devised to select confirmed agb binaries and the latter intends to discard m - stars belonging to the rgb phase .",

    "two general properties can be derived from this sample of confirmed agb stars : @xmath65 ( except in the case of fr cam ) and the detection of a far - uv counterpart ( except hip60998 = hd108907 = 4 dra ) .      after having tested the method proposed by @xcite to investigate the uv excess associated with confirmed binary agb stars ,",
    "we extend it to a volume - limited sample of agb stars .",
    "there are different lists of nearby agb stars in the literature that could be used to assamble a volume - limited sample of agb stars @xcite",
    ". however , all these `` old '' lists suffer from large uncertainties in the determination of the stellar distances @xcite .",
    "this limitation has been overcome with the advent of _ hipparcos _ , which allowed the determination of visual photometry , position , proper motion and annual parallax with accuracy starting at @xmath66 _ mas _ ( milli - arcsec ) for magnitudes @xmath67 up to @xmath68 _ mas _ near the limiting magnitude @xmath69 of the survey @xcite .",
    "thus , since @xmath70 increases with the apparent magnitude and @xmath71 decreases with the distance , the relative uncertainty @xmath72 for a star generally increases with its distance .",
    "red giant stars were selected from the list of _ hipparcos _ sources classified by @xcite as m- , c- ,",
    "s- and oh / ir stars . in order to remove rgb stars from that list , we selected only stars with luminosity higher than the tip of the rgb ( @xmath73 , * ? ? ? * ) obtained by @xcite .",

    "beyond this distance , the distance uncertainties based on _ hipparcos _ data are larger than those reported by other formerly proposed distance scales .",
    "therefore , the volume - limited sample of agb stars in the solar neighbourhood studied in this paper is limited to a distance of 500 pc .    after applying the above criteria ,",

    "another significant statistical differences between this sample and that of confirmed agb binaries are that only 50% of the volume - limited sample ( 27 out of 53 stars ) have a far - uv counterpart , while @xmath61 spans over a wider range of values , from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "the uv excess observed in agb stars can be used to assess the properties of their putative companions , such as the temperature . assuming that the secondary component is a ms star",
    ", there is a close relationship between its intrinsic flux and the effective temperature . in this section",
    "we obtain the temperature of the companion star using two methods : ( 1 ) the near - uv and the far - uv flux in excess of the agb star and ( 2 ) the near - to - far uv excess flux ratio .    once the distance to the the star is known , the uv flux density that would be emitted by a ms companion star is calculated using the method described in sect .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "thus , the secondary s flux density is calculated as the difference between the observed _ galex _ and the predicted ( theoretical ) flux density , listed in tables [ table - sahai ] , [ table - famaey ] and [ table - ita ] . the temperature of the secondary star is given by the intersection of the horizontal line corresponding to the source s uv excess and the flux - density curve corresponding to the distance of the star in the @xmath114 _ versus _ @xmath115 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - detect ] ) .",
    "the method is carried out separately in the near- and far - uv _ galex _ bands .",
    "the second method is based on the @xmath116 excess ratio .",
    "this quantity is compared with the prediction of a theoretical model of ms stars , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ detect ] , being thus similar to the temperature commonly determined from colour indices .",
    "table [ table - dobles ] lists the temperature of the agb companions obtained with the two methods described above .",
    "in general , we observe the following inequality : @xmath117 ( see also fig . [ fig - txt ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the uv excess can not be ascribed to a single stellar spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig - temp ] shows the temperature of the secondary members of the three samples obtained with the first method , using the near- and far - uv excesses .",
    "the reduced number of stars closer than 100 parsecs ( only @xmath63 ceti and hd89758 = @xmath11 uma ) is a natural limitation caused by the relative low density of agb stars in the solar neighbourhood . on the other hand , the relative larger number of objects near the distance upper limit of 500 pc results from the fact that , assuming a constant density of stars , the number of objects at a distance @xmath39 increases with @xmath118 . on average , temperatures obtained from the far - uv excess flux are higher than those determined from the near - uv band .",
    "there is also a selective distribution of temperatures when the three distinct samples are compared , but this is mostly due to selection effects . the sample studied by @xcite and @xcite are biased towards uv bright objects , whilst that described in sect .",
    "[ results - nearby ] is a distance - limited sample .",
    "@xcite used the second method to determine the temperature of the secondary , i.e. based on the near - to - far uv flux density ratio and atmosphere models by @xcite . table [ table - dobles ] shows a good agreement between their results and ours .",
    "for instance , y gem has one of the highest @xmath116 ratio and @xcite argue that its companion might have a blackbody temperature as high as 38,000 k , which is beyond the spectral range considered in our study , restricted to intermediate - mass ms stars .",
    "our results , obtained with the same method , confirms this conclusion .",
    "we note that some uv sources are associated with x - ray sources , but no clear relationship seems to exist among them , neither with the amount of far - uv excess , and/or the temperature of the secondary .    .",
    "colour code refers to different samples as in figure  [ fig - txt ] .",
    "filled symbols represent sources with @xmath65 and empty symbols @xmath119 . in the case where multiple uv observations are available",
    ", the maximum and minimum values of the fluxes are represented.,width=302 ]",
    "one of the major concerns when fitting photometric or spectroscopic data of agb stars is their variability .",
    "this effect acts differently along the spectrum , changing its shape as pulsation changes the stellar temperature . as commented in sect .",
    "[ results - sahai ] , mira- and sr - type variables often show a peak - to - peak variation of @xmath120 magnitudes ( a factor @xmath121 in flux ) in the @xmath122 band @xcite .",
    "the majority of the galex measurements were taken only once or twice , which is clearly insufficient to sample the whole range of the uv fluxes along the cycle . therefore , in the cases where one or just a few multiple photometric measurements of a given source were taken , the actual amplitude of variability might be larger than the measured interval of fluxes .",
    "the majority of the confirmed binaries listed in table  [ table - famaey ] show a variation in flux of 10 - 20% , whereas other systems , like @xmath63 ceti and y gem for example , show relative flux variations over one order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that the variability of the primary might affect the uv flux emitted by its companion .",
    "this effect is more evident in the far - uv band , where the predicted flux of the primary is over 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the values detected by galex .",
    "therefore , besides the intrinsic variability of the primary s atmosphere , other effects might play a role in the large uv amplitude observed in some binary agb stars .",
    "for instance , it is well known that some agb stars may exhibit large circumstellar dust envelopes ( cde ) that can extend up to 1000 stellar radii .",
    "the extended atmosphere of the agb star and its cde may block part of the uv radiation emitted by the companion .",
    "an accurate estimate of this effect depends on various factors , most of them poorly known , such as the orbital parameters of the system , including the inclination angle , the extinction law of the dust ( which depends on the chemical composition ) , the density law , and the opacity of the cde .",
    "figure [ fig - temp ] shows that the variation of 1.3 dex in the near - uv flux of @xmath63 ceti causes a change of 1000  k in the determination of its temperature .",
    "the effect on the far - uv band is even more important : the variation of 1.2 dex in flux of y gem modifies its temperature by 1800  k.    another possiblity would be the uv emission produced by an accretion flow onto the secondary or an accretion disk around it .",

    "all of them have been detected in the near - uv and all of them , but hd108907 , have also a far - uv counterpart .",
    "this is especially significant because whilst @xmath60 varies between @xmath157 , the excess in the far - uv band is much larger , @xmath158 .",
    "this means that , as the near - uv flux has relative contributions of the primary and the secondary , the far - uv flux is originated mostly in the secondary .",
    "therefore it can be proposed that the detection of an agb star in the _ galex _ far - uv band is probe of binarity .",
    "a second criterium to select binary agb candidates is the near - uv excess , expressed as @xmath60 .",
    "although disentangling the various effects that contribute for the flux variability ( and as a consequence @xmath60 ) would require a modelization of each individual binary system , it is possible to establish a general statistical criterium for the majority of the objects .",
    "a @xmath122-band amplitude of 3 mag ( a factor 16 in flux ) has been observed in the light curve of several types of variable agb stars @xcite , which suggests that near - uv excesses in the approximate interval @xmath159 can be partially explained by the agb variability .",
    "accounting for this intrinsic agb variability , we propose @xmath111 as an additional criterium for selecting binary agb candidates . the lower limit of this quotient is uncertain , and in any case binarity should be confirmed only after a careful monitoring of the radial velocity .",
    "the assumption of far - uv detection _ and/or _ @xmath65 as a general criterium to select binary agb stars would select the following agb stars of this study as binaries : all the objects studied by @xcite shown in table [ table - sahai ] ; all the agb stars selected from @xcite listed in table [ table - famaey ] ; 34 objects among the 53 listed in table [ table - ita ] .",

    "galex _ not known to be symbiotic systems , 5 were not detected in the survey and 53 were detected in the far- and/or near - uv bands . among these , 34 stars have been selected as binary agb candidates .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of candidates is 34/58 or 59% , higher than some previous studies focused on other samples : 8% of spectroscopic binaries in field red giants @xcite and 26% in three open clusters @xcite .",
    "additional work , e.g.  based on kinematic data , should be devoted to confirm the candidates selected in the present study , which eventually may decrease the incidence of confirmed agb binary systems .",
    "this work has focused on the search for main - sequence ( ms ) companions of agb stars detected in the galex survey .",
    "this study extends the method originally proposed by @xcite : the uv excess of agb stars is due to the presence of a companion , which can be detected above the emission of the primary if its temperature is @xmath160 6000  k and the flux is within the detection limits of the galex survey .",
    "after analysing the characteristics of the uv emission of a sample of _ bona - fide _ binary agb stars detected with galex , it can be concluded that :    1 .   within a distance of 500 pc ,",
    "galex detection limits of ms stars are @xmath1605000  k and @xmath1616500  k for the near - uv and far - uv bands , respectively .",
    "2 .   although the uv flux originates mostly from the secondary star , other extrinsic factors might affect its intensity , causing variability , for instance , the intrinsic variability of the primary and the opacity of a common envelope of gas and dust or accretion of material onto the secondary or onto an accretion disk around it .",
    "3 .   the galex near - uv excess of confirmed binary agb stars varied within @xmath64 and @xmath162 .",
    "a possible criterium for binarity is : ( 1 ) detection in the far - uv galex band _ and/or _ ( 2 ) @xmath65 .",
    "5 .   the uv excess of the candidates to binary agb stars can not be fitted with a single - temperature companion .",
    "the uv emission of the secondary is possibly affected by the extended atmosphere of the primary and/or its circumstellar envelope or it may reveal additional sources of uv emission in accretion processes .",
