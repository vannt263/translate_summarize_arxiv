    "it is well known that there is an su(3 ) flavor symmetry between the wave functions of the octet baryons .",
    "very recent lattice qcd calculations also suggest that the @xmath2 and proton quark structures can be related by an su(3 ) transformation  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to investigate the parton distributions of the octet hyperons by means of structure functions in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , since they can not be used as a target due to their short life - time .",
    "also one obviously can not produce a beam of charge - neutral hyperons such as @xmath2 .",
    "therefore there is no experimental information on the relation between the parton distributions of octet hyperons and those of the nucleon .",
    "however , it has been proposed that the quark fragmentation functions might be related to the corresponding quark distributions by a so called gribov - lipatov relation  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can explore the relation between quark distributions of octet baryons by means of hyperon production from quark fragmentation .",
    "actually great progress has been made along this direction recently  @xcite .",
    "a specific regularity in baryon production rates in @xmath3 annihilation has been recently noticed by chliapnikov and uvarov  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there has not been a detailed investigation on the relation among the octet baryon fragmentation functions .",
    "the data shows a striking suppression of the cross section as the mass of the produced hadron increases , which is puzzling since naive su(3 ) would suggest that they should be comparable . for example , once an s - quark is produced then one could think that the @xmath4 ratio would be @xmath5 , since the @xmath6 pair is statistically three times more likely to be in an isospin @xmath7 state than in isospin @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless the experimental data shows just the opposite trend , with a lower cross section for @xmath9 production ( see fig .",
    "[ ys1f1 ] ) .",
    "apparently something in the fragmentation process makes it much easier for the s - quark to pick up an isosinglet @xmath6 than an isotriplet .    in this paper",
    "we will not provide a detailed physical explanation of the suppression .",
    "our , more modest , purpose is to give a consistent simple parameterization of all the fragmentation functions into octet baryons , with a rather small number of free parameters .",
    "nevertheless , since the parameterizations that we obtain are inspired by well known input models , they can be considered a first step into a physical understanding of these processes . for every octet baryon ,",
    "there are 18 ( unpolarized , longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized ) quark / antiquark fragmentation functions .",
    "as a sensible parametrization of a fragmentation function usually needs at least 3 parameters , a lot of experimental data are needed in order to fix all of them .",
    "we plan to constrain the shape of fragmentation functions with the help of some models in order to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "models such as those using strings and shower algorithms  @xcite still involve many parameters , and therefore with these models it is difficult to obtain a clear relation among the fragmentation functions for various octet baryons . on the other hand , the diquark model given in ref .",
    "@xcite can provide us with su(3 ) flavor symmetry relations for octet baryon fragmentation functions .",
    "an investigation of the spin structure of the diquark fragmentation functions can be found in previous publications  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the spin structure of the diquark model fragmentation functions for the @xmath2 is supported by the available experimental data  @xcite , which indicates that the diquark model works well in describing the fragmentation functions . in the present work",

    "ii , we briefly describe our ansatz of the fragmentation functions for all octet baryons based on the diquark model and the string model . using only eight free parameters ,",
    "we relate the fragmentation functions for all octet baryons to each other",
    ". the free parameters of the model are determined based on the experimental data on octet baryons production in @xmath3 annihilation , where the mass suppression effect in hyperon production is very important in order to understand the available experimental data . in sec .",
    "iii , we propose a possible cross check of the mass suppression via octet baryon production in charged lepton dis . in sec .",
    "iv , we give predictions for cross sections of baryon production in @xmath1 collisions with the obtained fragmentation functions for the octet baryons . finally , we give a summary with our conclusions in sec .",
    "recently , it was found that a simple diquark model can be used to describe quite accurately the octet baryon fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model were determined by fitting the experimental data of octet baryon production in @xmath3 annihilation . in this work ,",
    "we adopt an alternative approach and present a parametrization based on the spin and flavor structure predicted by the diquark model .",
    "we focus our attention on the relation between the fragmentation functions of various octet baryons .",
    "in contrast to the nucleon parton distributions which are well determined by experimental data , we have much less information on fragmentation functions for the octet baryons .",
    "for this reason , we constrain the fragmentation functions with the help of some models in order to reduce the number of free parameters . in particular the diquark model  @xcite has a clear physical motivation and needs only a few parameters .    within the framework of the diquark model  @xcite",

    "we introduce flavor structure ratios    @xmath38    @xmath39    and spin structure ratios    @xmath40    @xmath41    with @xmath13 or @xmath14",

    "we could use the expression of @xmath48 coming from the diquark approach and fix the parameters of the model by a fit to the experimental data as it was done in ref .",
    "another way is to use a commonly accepted parametrization form such as    @xmath49    with the exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 at an initial scale @xmath52 .",
    "previous work  @xcite indicates that compatible results can be obtained in both ways . in our present analysis",
    ", we adopt the later approach , with the analytical expression ( [ fit1 ] ) for @xmath48 , since this simple parametrization can be easily used later for other purposes .",
    "in addition , the diquark model fragmentation functions are easier to describe in the large @xmath17 region where the valence quark contribution dominates . in the small @xmath17 region ,",
    "the sea contribution is difficult to include in the framework of the diquark model .",

    "however the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effect due to this difference in quark , diquark and baryon masses in the diquark model is too weak to explain the experimentally measured values for the average hadronic multiplicities per hadronic @xmath3 annihilation event  @xcite , where hyperon production is significantly suppressed as compared with proton production . actually , we find that the cross sections for @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath68 baryons in @xmath3 annihilation would be overestimated by up to two orders of magnitude if we only considered this su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the framework of the diquark model .",

    "for simplicity , we do not include su(3 ) symmetry breaking caused by the difference in quark , diquark and baryon masses in the diquark model itself since this is small .",
