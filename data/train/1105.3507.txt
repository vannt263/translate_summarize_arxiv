    "josephson junctions are building elements of many electronic and electromagnetic devices as well as a candidate for quantum computers@xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "one usually integrates large arrays of junctions on a chip to enhance the performance , thus coherent operations in these junctions are crucial .",
    "the synchronization between junctions can be realized by coupling them to a common resonator , most frequently through electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the common resonator establishes long - range interaction between junctions , which then synchronizes them under appropriate condition .",
    "the junctions arrays have become an extremely important playground to understand the synchronization mechanism for large population of nonlinear oscillators , partially because of the relatively easy experimental realization.@xcite .",
    "the successful observations of coherent emission from cuprate superconductors renew the interests in understanding the synchronization of arrays of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "cuprate superconductors , such as @xmath0 ( bscco ) , are a natural realization of a stack of josephson junctions of atomic thickness @xcite , known as intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs ) . because of the large supercoducting energy gap , these build - in josephson junctions can be operated at frequencies in the terahertz region , where the electromagnetic waves have wide applications @xcite .",
    "radiation from ijjs occurs in the resistive state .",
    "such a state is reached by increasing the bias current above the josephson critical current and then diminishing it down to the voltage @xmath1 corresponding to the target frequency according to the josephson relation @xmath2 . the resistive state is preserved down to the retrapping current below which the system undergoes transition into the zero - voltage state .",
    "such a procedure is possible because the resistivity of ijjs is very large , i.e. junctions are strongly underdamped .",
    "thus the hysteretic behavior allows us , in principle , to reach a quite low voltage of the order of that corresponding to the josephson frequency ( @xmath3 for bscco ) . in the resistive state , josephson plasma of composite oscillations of cooper pairs and electromagnetic waves",
    "is excited .",
    "if the plasma oscillations are in - phase , then the total radiation power is proportional to the number of junctions squared . below a threshold current",
    "called retrapping current , the resistive state becomes unstable and the system switches into zero - voltage one .",
    "important questions to be addressed are :    1 .   what is the retrapping current in the array of point junctions and how a shunt affects it .",
    "2 .   in what parameter region of junction and",
    "shunt where oscillations of junctions remain synchronized in the resistive state .",
    "the stability of synchronized oscillations depends crucially on interaction between junctions .",
    "the junctions in cuprate superconductors interact with each other through nearest neighbor coupling , either inductive or capacitive .",
    "these short - range interaction however is insufficient to establish a global phase coherence @xcite .",
    "there are two methods to achieve global synchronization by coupling all junctions to a common resonator .    in the first approach ,",
    "the cavity formed by the superconductors single crystal plays a role of the resonator @xcite .",
    "the synchronization is realized by the excitation of cavity mode in the crystal@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the synchronization can be achieved by the radiation fields@xcite and/or by a shunted circuit @xcite .",
    "the synchronization by a shunted circuit attracts considerable interests , because it can be implemented easily .",
    "real junctions involve thermal noise , especially for those in high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "generally , one expects thermal noise broaden the linewidth of oscillating spectrum , or even destroys the coherence .",
    "it is preferable to have robust coherent oscillation against noise . to this end",
    ", it is important to know how thermal fluctuations destroy the synchronization .",
    "the dynamical process of building up the synchronization is also important for both applications and theoretical understandings . for an initial condition that is very close to the fully synchronized state , the relaxation to synchronized state",
    "can be analyzed based on the standard local stability analysis@xcite .",
    "however , for a complete random initial state , the dynamic process is highly nontrivial .",
    "the system may even not relax into the synchronized state .",
    "two questions naturally arise : how to reach the synchronized state in a controlled way and what is the relaxation time ?    in this paper , we consider a one dimensional array of point josephson junctions coupled to a common circuit .",
    "first we provide analytical and numerical study on the stability of the synchronized state and map out the stability phase diagram . based on the diagram",
    ", we derive the dependence of the retrapping current on the shunt circuit .",
    "then we introduce thermal noise into the system and describe the effect on the synchronization .",
    "mean - field critical behaviors are identified at the desynchronization transition , i.e. transition from the the synchronized state to the state with random or partially random oscillations .",
    "we reveal the dependence of the transition temperature on the shunt circuit and bias current .",
    "based on these results , a possible stability diagram of the synchronized oscillations is constructed taking thermal noise into account . finally , we study the relaxation dynamics starting from a disordered state , where junctions oscillate randomly .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform stability analysis of the synchronized oscillations both numerically and analytically . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the desynchronization transition of the coherent state and obtain the corresponding transition temperature . in sec .",
    "v , we study the dynamic relaxation from disordered initial state into the synchronized state . the paper is concluded by a short summary .",
    "arrays of josephson junctions coupled to a common load have been extensively studied decades ago @xcite , not only for their importance for the application in electronic device , but also as a fruitful platform to understand the underlying synchronization mechanism .",
    "these models although are less transparent than the well known kuramoto model @xcite , can be realized experimentally@xcite much easier than the kuramoto model .",
    "the latter has been realized experimentally only very recently @xcite , long after its proposal .",
    "some specific configuration of the array , such as one dimensional array of josephson junctions shunted by a serial rlc circuit , can be mapped into the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "we consider a stack of ijjs with lateral sizes of order of several micrometers .",
    "this geometry of junctions is an alternative route to strong emissions@xcite and has attracted lots of attention recently . in this case , the variation of superconductivity phase in the lateral direction is small and the junction can be approximated as a point junction .",
    "the inductive coupling@xcite between junctions then vanishes under this approximation .",
    "meanwhile , the capacitive coupling@xcite between junctions is weak and short - range , thus it can be neglected in comparison with the long - range interaction mediated by the shunt circuit . under these simplifications ,",
    "a stack of ijjs reduce to a serial array of point junctions .",
    "we study a serial array of point josephson junctions shunted by a lumped @xmath5 circuit , which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "each junction is modeled as resistively and capacitively shunted circuit .",
    "the total current across the junction is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the voltage of the junction according to the ac josephson relation . here",
    "@xmath8 is the gauge invariant superconductivity phase difference of @xmath9-th junction , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the resistance , capacitance and critical current of the junction respectively .",
    "using the kirchhoff s loop law , we obtain the equation of motion @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the charge on the shunted capacitance , @xmath16 is the shunted capacitance and @xmath17 is the bias dc current .",
    "we have introduced the nyquist noise ( white noise ) current @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature .",
    "we have also assumed that junctions are identical . in the presence of the common circuit , small spread in the junction s parameters will not destroy the coherent oscillations .",
    "we will use dimensionless quantities in the following calculations .",
    "the time is in units of josephson plasma frequency @xmath22 , current in units of @xmath12 , capacitance in units of @xmath11 , resistance in units of @xmath10 .",
    "we then arrive at the dimensionless version of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 is the mccumber number which determines the hysteretic behavior of junctions . upon increasing the bias current ,",
    "the system remains zero - voltage until the bias current exceeds the critical current .",
    "then the junctions switch into resistive state .",
    "the system keeps resistive even when the bias current is reduced below the critical current for a junction with small @xmath28@xcite . in the resistive state",
    ", the superconductivity phase @xmath8 is rotating accompanied by small oscillations .",
    "the angular velocity of the rotation for @xmath8 is the same for all junctions determined by the voltage , but the phase @xmath8 may vary from junction to junction .",
    "we will consider the synchronization of the phase of the junction arrays in the following .    in this model , all junctions",
    "are coupled to the capacitor @xmath16 , which establishes mutual interaction among all junctions .",
    "thus the effective dimensionality of the system is infinite , which is crucial for the synchronization @xcite .",
    "another consequence of this mean - field behavior is the permutation symmetry .",
    "i.e. , all junctions are biased by the same external current and the current in the shunt circuit . the exchange of any pair of junctions in the circuit does not change the topology of the circuit . if configuration @xmath29 is a solution to eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , then @xmath30 is also a solution .",
    "this symmetry greatly simplifies the stability analysis as will be shown below .    apparently , eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) always have a trivial solution that all junctions oscillate out of phase , and the dynamics of each junction is independent because the current in the shunt circuit vanishes .",
    "however suppose at some instance , a small population of junctions oscillate with the same phase , then the capacitance @xmath16 acquires energy , which is proportional to the number of in - phase junctions squared . now the capacitance is able to attract more junctions to oscillate at its phase and in turn its energy increases further .",
    "this is a positive feedback process with explosive increases of energy in the capacitance and an avalanche of junctions oscillating coherently .",
    "therefore we expect in certain parameter space , the out - of - phase oscillations lose stability and synchronization sets in .",
    "the qualitative picture will be elaborated in subsequent sections .",
    "in this section , we analyze the local stability of the coherent oscillations of all junctions in the absence of thermal fluctuations , @xmath31 .",
    "the local stability is determined by the dynamics of the system in the vicinity of the trajectory of the uniform solution .",
    "we consider the uniform oscillations @xmath32 , where @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the number of junctions .",
    "the junction coupling strength is enhanced by a factor of @xmath34 , in accordance with the typical behavior in the mean - field theory .",
    "we then add small perturbations @xmath35 to the uniform solution and determine the time evolution of the perturbations .",
    "the equations for the perturbations read @xmath36 the permutation symmetry between junctions allows us to decouple eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) by introducing the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we obtain equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 @xmath42 if @xmath43 diverges with time , the uniform solution becomes unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath40 diverges while @xmath43 decays with time , the synchronization is kept and the system transits into another synchronized state if it exists .",
    "we are interested in the coherent oscillation , and we will only focus on eq . ( [ eq9 ] ) in the later analysis .",

    "once we identify the desynchronization transition as a critical phenomenon , we can define the exponent @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , we obtain @xmath138 which is consistent with the mean - field theory .",
    "we then study which factors determine @xmath128 and how to enhance @xmath128 .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , @xmath128 is given by the action for the system moving out of the attractor .",
    "thus knowledge about the whole basin of attraction is needed .",
    "however , it is still conceivable that the local slope near the attractor may to certain extent reflect the global structure of basin .",
    "the local slope is just the largest floquet exponent obtained in the previous section .",
    "therefore one expects that the smaller the exponent , the higher @xmath128 .",
    "we find numerically that it is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] .",
    "the correlation between the largest floquet exponent and @xmath128 can be understood in terms of the local stability analysis .",
    "the small perturbations to the uniform oscillation decay @xmath139 with @xmath140 being the largest floquet exponent .",
    "this is equivalent to the relaxation of a particle in the parabolic potential @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "the slope @xmath143 measures the depth of the potential .",
    "thus it is more robust against noise for a larger @xmath144 .",
    "based on the previous analysis , we discuss the stability phase diagram of the synchronization in the presence of thermal noise . for a given @xmath16 , when the bias current is increased ,",
    "the system approaches the synchronous state , where the associated floquet exponent changes from positive to negative at the stability boundary .",
    "if the current increases further , it reach the maximal value @xmath145 . for a sufficient large current ,",
    "the system becomes neutral stable according to eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) . therefore the critical temperature first increases and then decreases with the current .",
    "the corresponding stability diagram is shown in fig . [",
    "meanwhile , the shunt capacitance plays a role of coupling strength , so @xmath128 increases with @xmath16 .",
    "keep in mind that the current at the stability boundary is the retrapping current . at a given @xmath21 , the retrapping current increase with @xmath16 for a small @xmath28 , while it decreases for a large @xmath28 .",
    "based on these observations , we construct the phase diagram of the coherent oscillations for a given @xmath28 , which is sketched in fig . [",
    "the region enclosed with green surface represents a stable synchronization .",
    "to enhance @xmath128 a larger @xmath28 is helpful since the maximal floquet exponent is @xmath145 .",
    "one should also adjust the current accordingly to ensure that the maximum is reached .",
    "for a given operating frequency , one may increase @xmath16 to enhance the thermal stability , at sacrifice of the oscillating amplitude .",
    "so far we have concentrated on the stability of the uniform oscillation , and investigated the dynamics of perturbations around the uniform state . however , in most applications , the initial condition can not be guaranteed as the state of uniform oscillations .",
    "for instance , when we ramp up the current and bias all junctions in the resistive state , the initial state may be far away from the uniform state in the phase space .",
    "therefore it is important to understand how the system approaches the uniform state . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the relaxation from disordered state ( all junctions oscillate out - phase ) into ordered state ( all junctions oscillate uniformly ) . for a system",
    "whose final ordered state is in _ equilibrium _ , this is a phase ordering phenomenon .",
    "the kinetics of phase ordering has been extensively studied decades ago in spin systems , and they can be described by universal scaling behavior@xcite .",
    "however the relaxation dynamics is not very clear when the final state is _ out of equilibrium_.    to reach the uniform state , the initial state must be in the basin of attraction of the uniform state .",
    "this can be realized by operating all junctions at resistive state .",
    "we prepare the initial state with arbitrary nonzero @xmath146 .",
    "we also give initial velocity to all junctions , as such the system falls into the basin of attraction of the uniform state .",
    "let us first consider dynamical relaxation obtained by computer simulation .",
    "we introduce the distribution of the phase difference between junctions @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath149 is depicted in fig .",
    "initially the distribution is flat indicating a disordered phase .",
    "this flat distribution does not change with time too much at the beginning , but then it suddenly becomes sharp .",
    "finally it reaches a steady distribution with finite width depending on the temperature .",
    "qualitative picture of the relaxation can be obtained based on the local stability analysis presented in section iii .",
    "suppose we have a small synchronized cluster of junctions with population @xmath150 and the rest of junctions oscillate randomly .",
    "this small cluster serves as a seed of the nucleation , and deliver energy into the shunt capacitor , which in turn attracts nearby out - phase oscillators into the cluster .",
    "the growth rate of the synchronized population can be estimated by the local stability analysis by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath151 , where @xmath151 is size of the cluster at time @xmath152 .",
    "the time evolution of the population of the cluster follows @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a small time step and @xmath155 is the largest floquet exponent with cluster size of @xmath156 .",
    "then the time required for the system achieves global synchronization is @xmath157 several observations are in order .",
    "first , the synchronization time @xmath158 increases with the total number of junctions @xmath34 . secondly ,",
    "since @xmath155 decreases monotonically with @xmath156 and then saturate at @xmath145 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) ] , the initial relaxation is slow and it gradually speeds up , in accordance with fig .",
    "thirdly , in the presence of thermal fluctuations , thermal noise may kick oscillators out of the synchronized cluster .",
    "thus the increase rate is reduced and relaxation time increases .    to quantify the relaxation process , we define the linear relaxation function@xcite @xmath159 it starts from unity at @xmath160 and decays to @xmath161 in the steady state .",
    "the relaxation time is defined as @xmath162 for an exponential decay , the definition above is equivalent to the conventionally defined relaxation time .",
    "two - stage relaxation for @xmath163 is found at @xmath31 .",
    "first @xmath91 increase from @xmath161 to a value close to @xmath164 , where the local stability theory applies .",
    "then the system relaxes into the ordered state exponentially with the exponent given by the floquet exponents .",
    "thermal fluctuations smear the distinction of the two - stage relaxation .",
    "we numerically calculate @xmath163 and compute @xmath165 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath165 on the number of junctions @xmath34 , temperature and shunt capacitor is plotted in fig . [ f13 ] . @xmath165 increases with @xmath34 as expected from the qualitative estimate above .",
    "furthermore the relaxation time follows a power law @xmath166 .",
    "the exponent @xmath167 increases with @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath165 increases with temperature . at @xmath128",
    "it diverges and then drops .",
    "( the relaxation time above @xmath128 is not very meaningful because the final state is also disordered .",
    ") critical behavior is also identified for @xmath165 near @xmath128 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath165 decreases with @xmath16 which suggests a practical way to speed up the relaxation .",
    "this can be explained by regarding @xmath16 as a coupling strength of the system .",
    "a larger @xmath16 therefore increases the rigidity of the uniform solution .",
    "in short , we have studied the synchronization of one dimensional array of point josephson junctions coupled to a shunt capacitor . in the case of noise - free system ,",
    "a stability phase diagram of the uniform oscillation is constructed . for strong",
    "damping , after the uniform solution becomes unstable , the system evolves into partially synchronized state .",
    "when the bias current is reduced below the josephson critical current , the system becomes zero - voltage . for weak",
    "damping or moderate damping , after the instability of the uniform solution , the system evolves into the zero - voltage state . at transition",
    "the current is the experimentally measurable retrapping current .",
    "the retrapping current is increased by the shunt capacitor for weak damping ( @xmath168 ) , while it decreases for moderate and strong damping ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "thus transport measurement provides a convenient probe of the underlying dynamics .",
    "similar results are obtained when a resistor is serially connected to the shunt capacitor .    in the presence of strong thermal noise",
    ", the coherent oscillation is destroyed through a second order phase transition .",
    "the critical exponent for the order parameter is @xmath169 in accordance with the mean - field theory .",
    "we also find the fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath91 showing a maximum at the transition , which may serve as a convenient quantity to locate the transition temperature .",
    "for a smaller relaxation time in the case of weak perturbations , the transition temperature is higher .",
    "the results suggest several possible ways to enhance the thermal stability .    the dynamic relaxation from a disordered phase to ordered state is then investigated .",
    "the relaxation time increases with the system size by a power law .",
    "it also increases when the system approaches the transition temperature from below .",
    "one may speed up the relaxation with a larger shunt capacitance .",
    "finally , a possible phase diagram of the uniform solution is proposed when thermal fluctuations are involved .",
