    "the unique capability of the swift satellite has yielded the discovery of interesting new properties of short and long gamma ray burst ( grb ) x - ray afterglows .",
    "indeed , recent observations have provided new informations on the early behavior ( @xmath0 ) of the x - ray light curves of gamma ray bursts .",
    "these early time afterglow observations revealed that  @xcite a fraction of bursts have a generic shape consisting of three distinct segments : an initial very steep decline with time , a subsequent very shallow decay , and a final steepening ( for a recent review , see piran 2005 , meszaros 2006 ) .",
    "this canonical behaviour of the x - ray afterglows of gamma ray bursts is challenging the standard relativistic fireball model , leading to several alternative models ( for a recent review of some of the current theoretical interpretations , see mszros 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "+ in order to determine the nature of both short and long gamma ray bursts , more detailed theoretical modelling is needed to establish a clearer picture of the mechanism .",
    "in particular , it is important to have at disposal an unified , quantitative description of the x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "+ the main purpose of this paper is to present an effective theory which allows us to account for x - ray light curves of both gamma ray bursts and x - ray rich flashes ( xrf ) . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we set up a quite general approach to cope with light curves from anomalous @xmath1-ray pulsars ( axp ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) .",
    "indeed , we find that the canonical light curve of the x - ray afterglows is very similar to the light curve after the june 18 , 2002 giant burst from axp 1e 2259 + 586 ( woods et al .",
    "this suggests that our approach can be extended also to gamma ray bursts .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ light ] we briefly review the general formalism presented in cea ( 2006 ) to cope with light curves . after that , in sect .",
    "[ 050315 ] through [ 050416a ] we carefully compare our theory with the several gamma ray burst light curves . in sect .",

    "finally , we draw our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "gamma ray bursts may be characterized by some mechanism which dissipates injected energy in a compact region . as a consequence the observed luminosity is time - dependent . in this section , following cea ( 2006 ) , we briefly discuss an effective description that allows us to determine the light curves , i.e. the time dependence of the luminosity .",
    "after that , we shall compare our approach with several light curves of swift gamma ray bursts .",
    "+ in general , irrespective of the details of the dissipation process , the dissipated energy leads to the luminosity @xmath3 . actually , the precise behavior of @xmath4 is determined once the dissipation mechanisms are known . however , we may accurately reproduce the time variation of @xmath4 without precise knowledge of the microscopic dissipative mechanisms .",
    "indeed , on general grounds we expect that the dissipated energy is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the efficiency coefficient .",
    "for an ideal system , where the initial injected energy is huge , the linear regime where @xmath7 is appropriate . moreover , we may safely assume that @xmath8 constant .",
    "thus we get : @xmath9 it is then straightforward to solve eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) : @xmath10 note that the dissipation time @xmath11 encodes all the physical information on the microscopic dissipative phenomena .",
    "since the injected energy is finite , the dissipation of energy degrades with the decrease in the available energy .",
    "thus , the relevant equation is eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) with @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", by solving eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) we find : @xmath13 where we have introduced the dissipation time : @xmath14 then , we see that the time evolution of the luminosity is linear up to some time @xmath15 , and after that we have a break from the linear regime @xmath7 to a non linear regime with @xmath12 .",
    "if we indicate the total dissipation time by @xmath16 , we get : @xmath17 equation  ( [ 2.6 ] ) is relevant for light curves where there is a huge amount of energy to be dissipated .",
    "+ several observations indicate that after a giant burst there are smaller and more recurrent bursts . according to our approach , we may think about these small bursts as similar to the seismic activity following a giant earthquake ( for statistical similarities between bursts and earthquakes , see cheng et al .",
    "these seismic bursts are characterized by very different light curves from the giant burst light curves .",
    "+ during these seismic bursts there is an almost continuous injection of energy , which tends to sustain an almost constant luminosity .",
    "this corresponds to an effective @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) which decreases smoothly with time .",
    "the simplest choice is : @xmath19 inserting this into eq .",

    "% \\ ] ] note that the light curve in eq .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) depends on two characteristic time constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we see that @xmath26 , which is roughly the number of small bursts that occurred in the given event , gives an estimation of the seismic burst intensity .",
    "moreover , since during the seismic bursts the injected energy is much smaller than in giant bursts , we expect values of @xmath6 which are lower with respect to typical values in giant bursts . + as we alluded in the introduction , the canonical light curves of the x - ray afterglows are very similar to the light curve after the 2002 june 18 giant burst from axp 1e 2259 + 586 . in cea ( 2006 )",
    "we were able to accurately reproduce the puzzling light curve of the june 2002 burst by assuming that axp 1e 2259 + 586 has undergone a giant burst , and soon after has entered into intense seismic burst activity .",
    "accordingly , we may parameterize the x - ray afterglow light curves of gamma ray bursts as : @xmath27 where , since there are no available data during the first stage of the outbursts , we have for the giant burst s contribution : @xmath28 while @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30^{\\frac{\\eta_{s}}{1-\\eta_{s } } }    , \\ ; \\ ;                   0 \\ ; < \\ ; t \\ ; < \\ ; \\tau_{diss } \\ ; \\ ; . % \\ ] ] note that , unlike the anomalous @xmath1-ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters , we do not need to take care of the quiescent flux since the gamma ray burst sources are at cosmological distances .",
