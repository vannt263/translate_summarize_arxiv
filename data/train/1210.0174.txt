    "owing to the gapless energy spectrum  @xcite , graphene layers ( gls ) absorb electromagnetic radiation in a wide spectral range ( from the ultraviolet to terahertz ) due to the interband transitions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , gls can be used in photodetectors , light sources , modulators , and mixers using the interband transitions  @xcite .",
    "the performance of these devices can be enhanced by utilizing multiple - gl structures  @xcite . for the infrared and visible spectral ranges ,",
    "the interband absorption prevails over the intraband ( drude ) absorption .",
    "however , in the terahertz ( thz ) range , especially at low thz frequencies , the drude absorption can dominate .",
    "the intraband absorption in gls can also be used in different devices for thz modulation and detection .",
    "the thz detectors , including uncooled detectors , exploiting the effect of electron or hole heating ( hot - electron or hot - hole bolometers ) in two - dimensional electron ( hole ) heterostructures made of a@xmath0b@xmath1 , cdhgte , and other compound systems were realized previously  @xcite . in this paper , we propose and analyze thz uncooled bolometric detectors based on gl structures .",
    "we demonstrate that such bolometers can exhibit fairly high responsivity , effectively operating at room temperatures and surpassing thz bolometers based on the traditional semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the main advantages of gl - based room temperature bolometers are associated with the following three factors : ( i ) high electron and hole thz conductivities at room temperature  @xcite and , hence , elevated drude absorption ; ( ii ) the dominant mechanism establishing the interband and intraband equilibrium is the interaction with optical phonons  @xcite ; ( iii ) long time of the electron and hole energy relaxation via optical phonons due to their large energy @xmath2  mev  @xcite ( this time is proportional to a factor @xmath3 and is very large for gls even at room temperature @xmath4  k ) .",
    "figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show the proposed ngl - gnr - pgl bolometers .",
    "the bolometers consist of two gapless n - type and p - type gl absorbing regions connected by an undoped array of gnrs with sufficiently large energy gap @xmath5 ( serving as the barrier region ) .",
    "the gls can be doped chemically [ as in fig .",

    "it is assumed that the gnr width , @xmath7 , is sufficiently small , so that the energy gap @xmath8 , ( where @xmath9  cm / s is the characteristic velocity of electrons and holes in gls ) is large enough to provide essential confinement of electrons in the n - gl and holes in the p - gl due to the formation of the barrier .",
    "the room temperature operation of field - effect transistors with sub 10  nm gnrs exhibiting fairly large energy gap was reported in ref .",
    "the energy barrier in such gnrs ensures a relatively strong dependence of the current on the effective temperature of electrons and holes enhancing the bolometer responsivity .",

    "we assume that due to relatively high electron and hole densities , the intercarrier scattering time is sufficiently short to provide fast maxwellization ( or fermization ) of the photoexcited electrons and holes . therefore , the electron and hole systems in gls are characterized by quasi - fermi energy @xmath16 and by the effective temperature @xmath17 .",
