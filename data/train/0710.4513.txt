    "collimated jets with high terminal velocities appear to be universal phenomena in astrophysics .",
    "they are often associated with young stellar objects , compact galactic objects , and active galactic nuclei [ livio 1997 ] .",
    "these jets are always accompanied by accretion disks on the equatorial plane .",
    "the magnetosphere of the accretion disk contains a plasma that follows the accretion of the materials in the disk .",
    "the plasma density and pressure get higher as the accretion approaches to the center which drive the magnetic field .",
    "the dynamics of this system was first described in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model by blandford and payne [ 1982 ] . in this landmark paper , jets are considered as a spatial structure in stationary state .",
    "ideal mhd equations in cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 are solved for time independent solutions .",
    "the central mass @xmath2 is replaced by a linear mass along the cylindrical axis .",
    "self - similar solutions in space with a scale invariance @xmath3 are sought .",
    "such self - similar solutions are compatible to a keplerian disk plasma rotation velocity field superimposed by an alfvnic plasma velocity .",
    "the complete mhd instability spectrum with such keplerian profile are analysed by keppens , casse , and goedbloed [ 2002 ] .",
    "this model predicts that the magnetospheric disk plasma would be ejected towards the polar direction magnetocentrifugally should the magnetic field lines be at an angle less than @xmath4 or more that @xmath5 on the @xmath6 plane with respect to the outward radius of the disk .",
    "collimating action of this plasma outflow would be provided by the hoop force of the azimuthal magnetic field and its associated parallel current in a force - free configuration .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic field with the plasma disk generates a mhd poynting flux [ ferreira and pelletier 1995 ] that can be converted into kinetic energy of the jet plasma [ zanni et .",
    "al . 2004 ] . variants of jet formation model are proposed by contopoulos and lovelace [ 1994 ] , contopoulos [ 1995 ] , and cao and spruit [ 1994 ] .",
    "this accretion - ejection model provides the basic framework of current investigations of accretion disk and jets as is reviewed by balbus and hawley [ 1998 ] .",
    "dissipative mhd effects are examined by casse and ferreira [ 2000 a , b ] and casse [ 2004 ] , and relativistic jets are analyzed by vlahakis [ 2004 ] .",
    "these stationary state analytic studies are often complemented by numerical works in cylindrical geometry to simulate time evolutions of the jets [ ustyugova et .",

    "al . 2002 ] .    here , instead of a stationary model",
    ", we take the view that jets are a time dependent spatial structure .",
    "what we see is only a snapshot of their state at this particular moment . due to their galactic dimensions ,",
    "the time scale of these structures is believed to be extraordinarily large which gives the impression of a stationary structure .",
    "this implies that jets are results of an erruption originating from the galactic nucleus .",
    "they could be dissipated in time before another erruption takes place due to pressure built - up from accretion . or one erruption could be superimposed on an earlier event . to model the jet system , we will do a self - similar analysis on the full time - dependent ideal mhd equations in spherical coordinates @xmath7 with a mass @xmath2 at the nucleus .",
    "in particular , we consider axisymmetric solutions .",
    "this type of self - similar solutions were pioneered by low [ 1982a , b , 1984a , b ] for astrophysical applications and solar corona mass ejections with pure radial plasma velocity flow .",
    "variants of these solutions include cases where the plasma domain lies outside the mass @xmath2 such as interplanetary magnetic ropes in one - dimensional [ osherovich , farrugia , and burlaga 1993 , 1995 ] and in two - dimensional [ tsui and tavares 2005 ] cylindrical geometry , interplanetary magnetic clouds [ tsui 2006a ] , and also atmospheric ball lightnings [ tsui 2006b ] in spherical geometry . in these descriptions where @xmath2 is outside the spherical domain of interest ,",
    "the magnetic field is axisymmetric force - free and contains regions of closed field lines , while the plasma is spherically symmetric decoupled from the magnetic field .    for the present case of extragalactic jets described by the mechanism of accretion - ejection",
    ", we will follow the self - similar solutions of low with the polytropic index @xmath8 , but with particular emphasis on the finite plasma pressure .",
    "this current approach differs from the keplerian disk plasma in that the radial flow is not tied to the alfvn velocity as a priori . in this dynamic model ,",
    "we consider jets as a manifestation of mass ejection on a galactic scale .",
    "the plasma pressure , in this self - similar mhd model , proves to have an important role in collimating the magnetic fields and the jet plasmas .",
    "the time evolution function gives a dynamic description of the high radial flow especially in the jets .",
    "the self - similar solutions , that converge at the center and at infinity , give small regions of closed axisymmetric two - dimensional magnetic field lines where plasma density and pressure are much higher .",
    "these regions along the jets could correspond to the high intensity islands in radio frequency maps .",
    "following the accretion - ejection classical model , we also use the mhd equations to describe the plasma .",
    "nevertheless , we retain the time dependence to write + @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14 + here , @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the bulk velocity , @xmath17 is the current density , @xmath18 is the magnetic field , @xmath19 is the plasma pressure , @xmath20 is the free space permeability , and @xmath21 is the polytropic index . for the bulk velocity , it is consisted of a radial and an azimuthal component to model the plasma outflow and the disk rotation . to be compatible to the physical situation ,",
    "the meridian velocity is taken to be null .",
    "for the radial component @xmath22 , we seek self - similar solutions where the time evolution is described by the dimensionless evolution function @xmath23 .",
    "the radial profile is time invariant in terms of the radial label @xmath24 , which has the dimension of @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 is independent of time , and corresponds to the lagrangian radial position attached to a fixed fluid element .",
    "the label @xmath26 corresponds to the radial positions of the initial self - similar configuration that expands in time with radial eulerian positions @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity can then be written as + @xmath28 + we consider a two - dimensional case with azimuthal symmetry in @xmath29 . in this case , the magnetic field , through the vector potential @xmath30 , can be expressed in terms of two scalar functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 + @xmath33\\}\\,\\ ] ]    @xmath34 + we remark that the velocity field in cylindrical stationary state accretion - ejection model is a three - component field .",
    "this is necessary because the jets are generated by magnetocentrifugal motion of the planar disk plasma to the axial direction . here",
    ", in this spherical dynamic model , the velocity field is a two - component field with @xmath35 , because the jets are generated by first pulling the disk plasma to the center and then redirecting it to space radially through erruptions .    by self - similar solutions in time , we mean a special class of time - dependent solutions where the time and space parts of the physical quantities are in a separable form .",
    "the time part is described by the evolution function @xmath23 , and the space part will be solved self - consistently by separation of variables .",
    "the concept of self - similar dynamics is closely related to self - organized states that often have minimum energy under given constraints . having this in mind",
    ", we now transform the independent variables from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , and proceed to determine the explicit dependence of @xmath38 in each one of the physical quantities with this radial velocity .",
    "first , making use of eq.(7 ) , eq.(1 ) renders + @xmath39 + considering the second equality , the first bracket is the convective time derivative in euler fluid coordinates , and this amounts to the time derivative in lagrangian fluid coordinates .",
    "we , therefore , have + @xmath40 + solving this equation for the @xmath38 dependence gives + @xmath41 + as for eq.(6 ) , with @xmath42 it follows that + @xmath43    @xmath44 + using the representation of eq.(8 ) , eq.(3 ) is represented by the following two equations + @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 + the first equation gives the function @xmath31 as + @xmath47 + as for the function @xmath32 , the right side of the second equation vanishes for rigid rotation to give + @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50 + we note that @xmath51 amounts to a constant plasma rotation , which has to be distinguished from the keplerian disk rotation of the solid material .",
    "comparing to the erruptive time scale of our dynamic approach of jets , this rotation rate is negligible and we take @xmath52 . as for the magnetic field components ,",
    "they are given by + @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55",
    "before proceeding with the analysis , let us recall on the fundamentals of self - organiation , in particular on mhd systems .",
    "we note that mhd equations , like navier - stokes equations , have quadratic invariants in the absence of dissipations . in mhd systems , there are three of them .",
    "they are the total energy ( plasma and magnetic ) , magnetic helicity , and cross - helicity . because of the existence of multiple invariants",
    ", the system tends to develope self - organized and self - similar states through dissipative processes regardless of the details of the initial conditions [ hasegawa 1985 ] .",
    "a simple example in fluid mechanics is the developement of shock waves from an initial explosion .",
    "another example is that fluid vortex rings ( solitons ) in air are often formed in fast upward drafts of smokes .",
    "should we consider a thin layer of oil heated from below , a grid of complex highly organized hexagonal convective cells would develope regardless of the details of the initial conditions .",
    "we note that , for self - organized states , the memories of the initial conditions are lost . in other words , we can not trace a self - organized state backwards in time to its initial conditions .",
    "they are lost in the dissipative processes that lead to organization .",
    "the underlying physical arguments for self - similar solutions are also discussed in detail by low [ 1982a ] . for these fundamental reasons ,",
    "although complex self - similar solutions are only a subset of general time - dependent mhd solutions , where most of them are not self - similar , they are prone to develope in nature with simple initial configurations .    numerically , starting from mhd equations with any fluctuations in a given initial configuration , self - organization could be reached since they are insentive to the details in the initial conditions .",
    "analytically , the nature of self - similarity implies that the dependent variables @xmath56 of a physical variable appear in separable form as we have done in eqs.(9 - 14 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the solutions will be obtained by the method of separation of variables .",
    "naturally , this imposes severe restrictions of the physical system where such a procedure is feasible , such as the dimensionality and symmetry .",
    "most of the self - similar solutions are established in axisymmetric systems whether cylindrical or spherical .",
    "nevertheless , gibson and low [ 1998 ] have made a great leap in establishing a three - dimensional spherical solution . under the framework of separation of variables , different kinds of solutions",
    "can be obtained for the same system depending on the choice of constants . likewise in mhd systems , we can have different self - similar solutions to account for different phenomena depending on how we separate the constants . in the next section ,",
    "we choose to solve the system with an oscillating radial solution because this solution gives magnetic toroids along the jet that match with observations .",
    "a monotonic decreasing or increasing radial solution in power form is also possible [ lynden - bell and boily 1994 ] .",
    "although this monotonic solution is not relevant for galactic jets , it could be useful for other natural phenomena such as in two - dimensional interplanetary magnetic ropes [ tsui and tavares 2005 ] and some other astrophysical objects .",
    "comparing the equation of @xmath42 and the equation of @xmath31 , we conclude that @xmath57 is a functional of @xmath31 or @xmath58 .",
    "we remark that usually we can not make the above statement just based on the similarity of the governing equations .",
    "it is only possible when we are under the framework of self - similarity .",
    "we can , therefore , write the @xmath59 dependence in @xmath60 and @xmath61 in terms of @xmath62 to get + @xmath63    @xmath64 + furthermore , the @xmath26 and @xmath62 dependences should be in a separable form in both + @xmath65    @xmath66 + so that , with an adequate @xmath21 , @xmath67 could come out as a functional of @xmath62 only . making use of eq.(4 ) to eliminate the current density in eq.(2 ) , we get the momentum equation which has three components .",
    "first , we examine the @xmath29 component which contains only the magnetic force + @xmath68    @xmath69 + the vanishing of the magnetic force in the azimuthal direction described by eq.(16a ) implies the functional relationship given by eq.(16b ) . as for the @xmath59 component , with the knowledge of @xmath70 , it reads + @xmath71    @xmath72 + we remark that the first three terms of this equation represent the force - free field equation for @xmath73 [ aly 1984 , low 1986 , low and lou 1990 , lynden - bell and boily 1994 ] .",
    "the last term is the plasma pressure .",
    "this equation would be independent of the evolution function @xmath38 should we consider the @xmath8 case pioneered by low .",
    "we note that a nonlinear equation like eq.(17a ) has to be solved subject to the boundary conditions of a given physical problem .",
    "for example , should the problem on hand has an infinite external domain and power form radial solutions are physically reasonable , then we use fractional powers of @xmath62 for the functionals of @xmath74 and @xmath61 [ lynden - bell and boily 1994 ] . in our present case , we are interested in decaying oscillating solutions in @xmath26 .",
    "we , therefore , write + @xmath75    @xmath76 + where @xmath77 is a positive constant independent of coordinates and the functional @xmath62 .",
    "this is the simplest representation where the first equation gives a linear dependence of @xmath62 and the second equation reflects the positive definite nature of plasma pressure .",
    "this choice of constant @xmath77 in plasma pressure profile differs from the spherically symmetric radial coordinate dependent additive term in eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) of low [ 1984b ] .",
    "this difference of representation stems from the view that low considers eq.(17a ) as an equation that solves for the plasma pressure under a given @xmath62 . for this reason",
    ", the homogeneous solution corresponds to the spherically symmetric gasodynamic solution .",
    "we regard eq.(17a ) as an equation that solves for @xmath62 under a given plasma pressure that has a positive definite separable form as in eq.(18b ) .",
    "the choice of eq.(18a ) gives @xmath78 , a constant . with @xmath79 , eq.(17a )",

    "we call these secondary plasmoids , and call the larger self - similar plasmoid embedding all the secondary plasmoids the primary plasmoid .",

    "the field lines are , therefore , two - dimensional . as in the discussions concerning fig.(1 ) , this amounts to the @xmath94 mode in the fourier transform @xmath130 of the toroidal dependence .",

    "this @xmath203 outward flow would be followed by an accelerated inward flow , should we take the negative sign on the square root , so that the system would be periodic and bounded .",
    "we , therefore , see that the system would make a transition from a bounded to an unbounded state when @xmath186 goes from negative to positive .",
    "the bounded state allows us to define the boundaries of the radial label @xmath206 such that @xmath207 .",
    "the solutions of the evolution function in eq.(24b ) suggest that jets are a result of an erruptive process .",
    "this process is fed by plasma accretion from the galactic disk .",
    "as pressure builds up at the center , the plasma begins to oscillate , or to pulse , as described by the bounded solution with @xmath203 .",
    "we believe that it is during this phase that self - organized and self - similar structures in plasma parameters and magnetic fields would be nourished through dissipations .",
    "the dynamics is given by self - similar solutions where the magnetic fields are self - consistent to the plasma pressure that plays the role of the eigenvalue .",
    "the jet structure emerges along the polar axis as the eigenfunction of the magnetic field . by further pressure built - up and energy influx ,",
    "@xmath201 becomes positive , and the structure eventually errupts .",
    "now we have presented the general structure of galactic jets .",
    "it begins with an influx of plasmas from the accretion disk which drives up the plasma pressure at the galactic nucleus .",
    "the mhd plasma responses to self - organization by oscillating , or pulsating , periodically in time .",
    "as @xmath186 goes from negative to positive , the periodic mode goes to an erruptive mode .",
    "the result of self - organization is a structured configuration in space .",
    "this structure is not unique . for galactic jets ,",
    "we have solved the system with the method of separation of variables as such that it ressembles to observations .",
    "this structure contains basically convective cells in space where magnetic field lines in adjacent cells rotate in opposite sense .",
    "although such a structured configuration with consistent evolution function is in accordance with the time - dependent mhd equations , there is no mention of the initial configuration that could lead to such self - similar states .",
    "consequently , such a highly organized complex structure could be regarded as an artificial result due to special mathematical constructions , which might not have any relevance to the physical jet system . in order to bring more reality to this analytic result",
    ", we recall the classical case of rayleigh - benard fluid self - organization . consider a thin layer of oil heated from below ,",
    "observations tell us that this simple homogeneous configuration will develope an array of identical hexagonal convective cells if the temperature gradient across the layer is sufficiently large .",

    "should the initial state of this oil layer be altered by arbitrary fluctuations , same convective cells would still appear after the initial fluctuations are dissipated .",
    "numerically , such self - organized complex structure could be reached from the simple homogeneous initial configuration if the code is adequately pushed in the correct direction .",
    "guided by this fluid example , the self - similar jet structure could be regarded as the rayleigh - bernard equivalent in the mhd system .",
    "we could choose an initial state by taking @xmath208 in our solutions with plasma bounded between an outer sphere @xmath137 and an inner sphere @xmath209 . this would give a large global long wavelength structure in the spherical layer .",
    "we consider an equilibrium state with @xmath197 and @xmath203 with @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "let us take this moment as @xmath210 .",
    "an energy source in terms of pressure is supplied by the accretion disk to pump the mhd plasma at the lower boundary @xmath209 . at some moment",
    ", @xmath38 begins to depart from its equilibrium to fall towards the center due to perturbations . like in the oil layer case",
    ", this could trigger convections so that the long wavelength global structure cascades to short wavelength structures accepted by the system .",
    "cenvective cell scaling becomes smaller as @xmath104 gets larger .",
    "different from the flat layer fluid case , the convective cells in this spherical mhd layer are not identical , since there is a focusing effect to the polar axis .",
    "as for the spatial part , we have + @xmath211 + with @xmath61 given by eq.(18b ) , the above equation gives + @xmath212    @xmath213 + in our present case , we are considering a spherical shell domain that the radial label @xmath214 is excluded .",
    "the negative powers of @xmath26 in plasma pressure and mass density do not cause singularity .",
    "we have set @xmath215 , with vanishing net force on the flow , to obtain the second equality in eq.(25 ) to be compatible with the functional form of @xmath57 with @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , we could relax this condition to @xmath216 such that @xmath217 . to understand the implication of such inequality",
    ", we remark that + @xmath218 + therefore , it is just the acceleration of the flow to that of the central mass gravitational acceleration .",
    "since @xmath219 gets smaller as @xmath25 gets larger with @xmath220 scaling , this condition establishes that self - similar configurations can be organized , and bounded oscillations of the @xmath203 case can take place , as long as the plasma acceleration is much less that the gravitational acceleration . to close the entire self - similar system ,",
    "we now come to the functional @xmath221 for the adiabatic equation of state . with the results in eq.(18b ) and eq.(25 ) using @xmath216 , we have + @xmath222 + to understand the plasma structure of the jet , we note that the plasma pressure and mass density are @xmath223 dependent which means positive definite @xmath224 dependent , according to eq.(18b ) and eq.(25 ) respectively .",
    "the plasma pressure and the mass density have their minimum at @xmath225 .",
    "this minimum is positive nonzero because of the positive integration constant @xmath77 in eq.(18b ) . to discuss the plasma structure in the jets",
    ", we reproduce the part of fig.(3 ) in the range @xmath226 in fig.(9 ) .",
    "the segmented line for @xmath154 has @xmath110 at the cone boundary @xmath169 and at the cone center @xmath227 . in between",
    ", there is a minimum at @xmath228 .",
    "because of the quadratic dependence @xmath229 , these features correspond to a cavity - like structure for the plasma pressure and mass density of the jet , compatible to numerical simulations of the time - dependent dissipative mhd equations [ casse 2004 , zanni et .",
    "al . 2004 ] .",
    "other than the zeros of @xmath88 , @xmath134 also vanishes at radial locations where @xmath230 . with the quadratic dependence + @xmath231",
    "+ there are ripples for plasma pressure and mass density along the radial label .",
    "the radial function has two contributions .",
    "the part of the bessel function @xmath232 has an oscillating nature with decreasing amplitude , while the part of @xmath233 has an increasing amplitude that helps to maintain the ripple level of @xmath234 .",
    "the peaks of these ripples are at the topological center of each plasmoid which is the magnetic axis of the toroid where @xmath121 has a maximum line integral .",
    "these ripples are also seen in numerical simulations [ zanni et .",
    "al . 2004 ] .",
    "it is quite surprising that the results of this spherical temporal self - similar mhd model agree rather well qualitatively with numerical simulations of the time - dependent mhd equations for the cylindrical magnetocentrifugaling model .",
    "both of them give cavity structures in the transverse direction and ripple structures in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the polar jets , therefore , have a periodic and approximately equally spaced concentration of plasmoids in its longitudinal direction , except the first region which is more extensive .",
    "the closed magnetic field lines for adjacent plasmoids rotate in opposite sense .",
    "the plasma pressure and mass density have a hollow conic structure with ripples along the radial direction .",
    "such periodic structure happens to be compatible with radio observations where high intensity islands are mapped .",
    "these islands are usually thought to be periodic ejections of mass from the accretion disk . according to our model",
    ", they are rather the internal spatial arrangments of an expanding jet driven by an erruptive event .",
    "one of the main objections of self - organized plasmoid representation in free space in the absence of an adequate boundary is that it apparently violates the virial theorem which states that [ schmidt 1966 ] + @xmath235 + where @xmath236 is the moment of inertia of the plasmoid , @xmath237 is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field , @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the kinetic and thermal energies of the plasma , @xmath240 and @xmath241 are the electric and magnetic energies in the volume , @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the plasma and electromagnetic stress tensors . taking the volume to cover the entire plasma and field , the surface term on the right side vanishes . in laboratory plasmas , this surface could be the machine vessel .",
    "should the plasmoid be stationary , the volume term on the left side would be null , and the moment of inertia would be accelerating since the terms on the right side are all positive definite . while this statement has no conflict with the unbounded solutions",
    ", it apparently contradicts the stationary state of the bounded solutions .",
    "nevertheless , this argument has overlooked the asymptotically bounded nature of the @xmath203 plasmoid state . in this asymptotic case",
    ", we have @xmath244 so that @xmath236 is stationary . the fact that @xmath245 implies that @xmath236 is at an asymptotic minimum , not an acceleration of @xmath236 , which complies with the virial theorem .",
    "the classical accretion - ejection model of blandford and payne [ 1982 ] is a time - independent stationary state model with spatial self - similar mhd solutions in cylindrical geometry @xmath1 with alfvnic plasma flow velocity plus a rotation , all with keplerian scaling . in this model ,",
    "the jets are formed by convecting the magnetospheric disk plasmas from the disk plane to the axis by magnetocentrifugal action through the magnetic field lines with low inclination angles to the disk plane .",
    "the angular momentum of the plasma on the disk plane is focused to the axis .",
    "the jets were put in place in the distant past according to the spatial self - similar solutions in @xmath3 , and are maintained there by continuously transporting disk plasmas to the axis to sustain the axial outflow .",
    "collimation to the axis is accomplished by magnetic hoop force .    here",
    ", we have taken a dynamic view where jets are the consequences of erruptive events , based on time - dependent mhd equations in spherical geometry @xmath7 .",
    "the disk plasmas are accreted to the galactic nucleus where plasma pressure is built up to cause an erruption .",
    "the radially symmetric expanding velocity interacts the plasma with the magnetic field self - consistently through the mhd equations to generate spatial structures . due to the existence of multiple quadratic invariants in the absence of dissipations ,",
    "mhd systems have the tendency of developing self - organized and self - similar states through dissipative processes .",
    "the force - free configuration and the vortex nature of the magnetic field are akin to the quadratic invariants of the magnetic helicity and cross helicity of the mhd system . for these reasons , although temporally self - similar solutions are only a subset of general time - dependent mhd solutions , these self - similar configurations are prone to develope in natural phenomena .    we , therefore , describe these spatial structures by self - similar temporal solutions in @xmath246 . in this self - similar spherical model ,",
    "consistent self - similar representations of plasma pressure , mass density , and magnetic fields are worked out for the @xmath8 bc low model , with special emphasis on the finite @xmath0 case .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is described by an equation where the plasma pressure acts as the eigenvalue .",
    "the nature of this eigenvalue equation is as such that the magnetic field gets converged to the polar axis as a response to the high plasma pressure directly related to the eigenvalue . since the separation constant @xmath83 in this eigenvalue equation is a free parameter that as yet to be specified , there will be an adequate @xmath104 for almost any given plasma pressure . although the radial plasma velocity is isotropic , the spatial structures are not .",
    "they could be highly collimated along the axial direction , and expand into the previously void space as time progresses .",
    "although other types of solutions are permitted , we have specifically examined the solutions that bear resemblance with jet features with @xmath150 and @xmath247 . since plasma and magnetic field are frozen into each other , plasma outflow is also collimated to the polar axis .",
    "the existence of regions of closed field lines along the primary polar magnetic lobe permits secondary plasmoids be embedded in it .",
    "these secondary plasmoids appear to be compatible to the observed islands of radio intensities .",
    "the time evolution function of the radial velocity consistent to the temporal self - similar solutions has different types of solutions according to the sign of @xmath186 .",
    "although the equatorial disk magnetospheric plasma is not addressed here , the accelerated accretion of plasma influx could be modelled with @xmath194 as the boundary condition at infinity . as for the polar jets",
    ", @xmath248 gives a bounded oscillating , or pulsating , solution .",
    "this bounded stage , we believe , nourishes the self - organized and self - similar states . with @xmath249 , it gives an unbounded expanding solution with a high terminal velocity .",
    "it is apparent that plasma pressure due to accretion is the prime driving force that determines the value of @xmath186 .",
    "the bounded oscillation would make a transition to the unbounded expansion as @xmath186 goes from negative to positive .",

    "<S> this allows a structure of magnetic lobes in space , among which the polar axis lobe is strongly peaked in intensity and collimated in angular spread comparing to the others . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the polar lobe overwhelmes the other lobes , and a jet structure arises in the polar direction naturally . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , within each magnetic lobe in space , there are small secondary regions with closed two - dimensional field lines embedded along this primary lobe . in these embedded magnetic toroids , </S>",
    "<S> plasma pressure and mass density are much higher accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> these are termed as secondary plasmoids . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field lines in these secondary plasmoids circle in alternating sequence such that adjacent plasmoids have opposite field lines . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , along the polar primary lobe , such periodic plasmoid structure happens to be compatible with radio observations where islands of high radio intensities are mapped . </S>"
