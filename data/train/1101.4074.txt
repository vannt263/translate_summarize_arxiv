    "in the past decade it was shown that , for both hawking @xcite and unruh @xcite effects , temperature and entropy emerge from information loss associated with real and accelerated - observer horizons , respectively .",
    "it was firstly demonstrated in @xcite that an observer with a constant acceleration @xmath2 in de sitter space will detect a temperature given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the de sitter radius .",
    "this result was soon generalized by deser and levin @xcite that the local hawking temperatures @xmath5 measured by accelerated detectors in ( anti-)de sitter ( ads / ds ) geometries can be obtained from their corresponding rindler observors with constant accelerations by using the global embedding approach ( gea ) . for more examples on the equivalence , such as banados - teitelboim - zanelli , schwarzschild , schwarzschild - ads ( ds ) , and reissner - nordstr \" om solutions into higher dimensional minkowskian spaces etc . , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called btz ( banados - teitelboim - zanelli ) black hole solutions @xcite have played the important role in understanding microscopic degrees of freedom of black hole .",
    "the btz black hole , which is constructed by identifying points along the orbit of a killing vector in a three dimensional anti - de sitter space , is an exact solution of einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant in three dimensions .",
    "this kind of black hole has a topology of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes a conformal minkowski space in two dimensions .",
    "following the same logic , one can construct analogues of the btz solution , the so - called constant curvature ( cc ) black holes in higher @xmath8 dimensional ads spaces @xcite . because @xmath9-dimensional anti - de sitter space has the topology @xmath10 , thel cc black holes have topology of @xmath11 , which is quite different from the known topology of @xmath12 for the usual black holes in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "in addition , the exterior region of these cc black holes is time - dependent and thus , there is no global time - like killing vector  @xcite . because of this feature , it is difficult to discuss hawking radiation and thermodynamics associated with these black holes .",
    "for example , see @xcite and references therein .    comparing with the anti - de sitter case",
    ", the @xmath9-dimensional de sitter space has the different topology @xmath13 .",
    "similar to the negative constant curvature case , a positive constant curvature spacetime was constructed in @xcite by identifying points along a rotation killing vector in a de sitter space .",
    "such solutions turn out to be counterparts of the three - dimensional schwarzschild de sitter solution in higher dimensions , and have an associated cosmological horizon .",
    "there is a parameter in the solution , which can be explained as the size of cosmological horizon .",
    "the equivalence between the lower dimensional hawking temperature and higher dimensional unruh temperature has been well established for the general spinning btz black hole in @xcite and the spinnless negative / positive cc black hole in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the hawking temperature obtained by cai and myung @xcite is the same as that obtained from semi - classical tunneling method @xcite .",
    "recently , a reduced approach to the study of hawking / unruh effects including their unification was proposed by authors of @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to generalize the equivalence for the spinnless cc black hole established in @xcite to the spinning one .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the construction of the spinless negative / positive cc black hole from the ( anti)-de sitter space by identifying the points along a boost direction . in section iii and iv ,",
    "we firstly construct the 5-dimensional spinning black hole with negative and positive constant curvature , respectively , and then establish the equivalence between the hawking temperature in 5-dimension and the unruh temperature in 6-dimension .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "in this section , we begin with a brief review the construction of the spinless cc black hole from the ( anti-)de sitter space by identifying the points along one boost direction .",
    "the @xmath9-dimensional ( anti-)de sitter space is defined as ( the universal covering ) of the hypersurface embedded into a @xmath14-dimensional minkowskian space , satisfying [ embd ] -x_0 ^ 2+x_1 ^ 2++x_n-1 ^ 2x_n^2=l^2,here and in the following paragraph of this section , we denote the upper and lower sign for anti - de sitter and de sitter space , respectively . the ( anti-)de sitter space adimits the boost along killing vector @xmath15 with norm @xmath16 .    in what follows , we will firstly discuss the anti - de sitter case , in which the @xmath14-dimensional flat space has two timelike coordinates [ mink ] ds^2=-dx_0 ^ 2+dx_1 ^ 2++dx_n-1 ^ 2-dx_n^2 .    to go further in the discussion ,",
    "let us introduce the local kruskal coordinates ( @xmath17 ) on anti - de sitter space ( in the region @xmath18 ) , x_&=&,=0,,n-2 , + x_n-1&= & ( ) , + x_n&= & ( ) where @xmath0 and @xmath19 are defined as [ ry ] r = r_+,and @xmath20 @xmath21 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the coordinate ranges are @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the restriction @xmath24 . by using kruskal",
    "coordinate , the induced metric on the anti - de sitter space reads [ kruskal ] ds^2=dy^dy^_+r^2d^2.without lossing any information , we shall restrict the discussion to the five dimensional case .",
    "the negative cc black hole can be easily obtained by introducing the local `` spherical '' coordinates @xmath25 [ schwatzlike ] y_0&=&f(r_+t / l),y_2=f , + y_1&=&f(r_+t / l),y_3=f , with @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "( note that these coordinates , with ranges @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , do not cover the whole region @xmath31 but only @xmath32 . )",
    "using these new coordinates , the metric ( [ kruskal ] ) can be casted into the schwazschild form [ schwatzlikemetric ] ds^2=l^2n^2d_3 ^ 2+n^-2dr^2+r^2d^2,with @xmath33 and d_3 ^ 2=-^2dt^2+(d^2+^2d^2 ) .    in this coordinate frame , the killing vector , generated a boost , becomes into @xmath34 with norm @xmath35 , and the spinless negative cc black hole can be obtained by identifying the points along the killing vector @xmath36 ~+2n , nz.the horizon for the negative cc black hole in these coordinates is located at @xmath37 , the point where @xmath38 vanishes .",
    "the positive cc black hole can be constructed analogously , by identifying the points along the same killing vector @xmath34 with norm @xmath35 . in details , we firstly embed the @xmath9-dimensional de sitter space into a @xmath14-dimensional minkowskian space [ mink2 ] ds^2=-dx_0 ^ 2+dx_1 ^ 2++dx_n-1 ^ 2+dx_n^2.furthermore , we define the kruskal coordinates @xmath39 on the @xmath9-dimensional de sitter space in the region @xmath40 , x_&=&,=0,,n-2 , + x_n-1&= & ( ) , + x_n&= & ( ) , with [ ry2 ] r = r_+,y^2=_y^y^ , + _",
    "= diag(-1,1 , , 1).here the coordinate range is @xmath41 , and @xmath42 with the restriction @xmath24 in order to keep @xmath0 positive . under the kruskal",
    "coordinate frame , the induced metric takes the same from with ( [ kruskal ] ) .",
    "we can also introduce schwarzschild coordinates to describe the solution .",
    "using local spherical coordinates @xmath43 defined as ( [ schwatzlike ] ) with @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] , and the coordinate ranges are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath45 , we find that the solution can be expressed as [ schwatzlikemetric2 ] ds^2=l^2n^2d_3 ^ 2+n^-2dr^2+r^2d^2,with @xmath46 and d_3 ^ 2=-^2dt^2+(d^2+^2d^2).like what happens for the negative constant curvature case , the spinless positive cc black hole can be constructed by identifying the points along the killing vector @xmath34 with norm @xmath35 ~+2n , nz.in these coordinates @xmath37 is the cosmological horizon .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath47 in the negative cc black hole space there is replaced by @xmath48 in the positive one .",
    "in this section , we firstly construct the 5-dimensional spinning negative cc black hole by virtue of the gea , then we calculate both the local hawking temperature observed by a time - like killing observer in the 5-dimensional hypersurface and the corresponding unruh temperature observed by a rindler observer in the 6-dimensional flat space .    by using the `` spherical ''",

    ", we can define the tolman temperature which is the local hawking temperature observed by the time - like killing observer ( @xmath58 ) located at @xmath0 [ hawking t ] 2t==,where @xmath59 is the tolman redshift factor which can be read off from ( [ metric2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the worldline of the time - like killing observer in the 5-dimensional spinning black hole space coincides with the trajectory of rindler observer with the constant acceleration [ a6 ] a_6",
    "^ -2=x_1 ^ 2-x_0 ^ 2=l^2 ^ 2,thus , the corresponding unruh temperature reads [ unruht ] 2t_du = a_6==.from ( [ hawking t ] ) and ( [ unruht ] ) we can easily see that the local hawking temperature measured by a time - like killing observer in the 5-dimensional space is nothing but the unruh temperature observed by a rindler observer in the 6-dimensional flat space .",
    "analogously , the 5-dimensional spinning positive cc black hole can also be constructed by using the `` spherical '' coordinate @xmath49 [ sph1 ] x_0=l(t- ) , + x_1=l(t- ) , + x_2=l , + x_3=l , + x_4=l(+t ) , + x_5=l(+t ) . plugging ( [ sph1 ] ) into the 6-dimensional minkowskian metric and identifying @xmath60 with @xmath61",

    "the cosmological horizon locates at @xmath1 and the ranges @xmath45 represents the interior of the horizon @xcite .",
    "the 5d cc black hole is constructed by indentifying [ pindentify ] ~+2n , nzthe time - like killing observer @xmath53 is chosen as [ pobs ] = -t , r , , = const.,then the corresponding proper velocity is [ pvel ] u^=(t , r,,,)=(,0,0,,0).the proper acceleration for observer @xmath53 can be derived by differentiating the proper velocity ( [ pvel ] ) with respect to the proper time [ pa5 ] a_5^=(0,-,-,0,0),thus the @xmath54 equals [ pa52 ] a_5=.the killing vector tangent to the worldline of the time - like observer ( @xmath55 ) reads @xmath63 , so the hawking temperature reads [ psurf g2 ] 2t_hk==.this result is consistent with those obtained in @xcite . along the integral curves generated by the killing vector @xmath57 ,",
    "the line element becomes [ pmetric2 ] ds^2&=&^2 + , + & = & -^2dt^2+.the local hawking temperature measured by the time - like killing observer ( @xmath58 ) located at @xmath0 equals the hawking temperature in ( [ psurf g2 ] ) rescaled by a redshift factor [ phawking t ] 2t==,where the redshift factor are derived in ( [ pmetric2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding unruh acceleration and temperature can also be obtained by using the same logic in the negative case [ pa6 ] a_6 ^ -2=x_1 ^ 2-x_0 ^ 2=l^2 ^ 2,and [ punruht ]",
    "2t_du = a_6==.as",
    "we expect that the tempratures ( [ phawking t ] ) and ( [ punruht ] ) coincide exactly .",
    "in this work , we established the equivalence between the local hawking temperature measured by the time - like killing observer located at some positions @xmath0 with finite distances from the outer horizon @xmath1 in the 5-dimensional spinning cc black hole space , and the unruh temperature measured by the rindler observer with constant acceleration in the 6-dimensional flat space by employing the globally embedding approach .",
    "for the spinning black hole with negative constant curvature , the local hawking or unruh temperature equals to @xmath64 , while for the postive case , the temperature reads @xmath65 , where @xmath4 is the radius of ( anti-)de sitter spaces and @xmath66 is the spherical coordinate of time - like killing observer .",
    "our results can recover the previous one in both the general spinning btz black hole @xcite when one sets @xmath67 and the spinnless black hole with negative / positive constant curvature @xcite when one sets both @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
