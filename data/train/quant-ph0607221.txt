    "in many cases one can reduce the quantum behavior of a system to that of a two - level system ( tls ) , which corresponds to a ( pseudo-)spin one half . the spin - down and spin - up state will be denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "if the tls is in state @xmath10 at time @xmath11 one obtains @xmath12 by solving the schrdinger equation    @xmath13    with initial condition @xmath14 .",
    "note , that we allow for an explicit time dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "one of the quantities of particular interest is the survival probability @xmath16 that the system remains in its initial state . for a tls with a level spacing depending linearly on time the result for @xmath0 as function of the sweep rate @xmath17",
    "has been derived approximately by landau @xcite and stckelberg @xcite and rigorously by zener @xcite and majorana @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 will depend sensitively on the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath15 and can not be calculated analytically , except in limiting cases , only .",
    "one of them is the adiabatic limit . in that limit",
    "it is known that @xmath19 converges to a superposition of the adiabatic states @xmath20 which are solutions of the eigenvalue equation : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the adiabatic eigenvalues .",
    "although @xmath23 and @xmath24 may not cross in real time ( avoided level - crossing ) this will happen for complex times @xmath25 .    in case of a _ real - symmetric _ hamiltonian matrix latexmath:[$\\langle \\nu    which is analytic in @xmath18 and for a single crossing point @xmath27 in the upper complex @xmath18-plane ( @xmath28 ) it was shown by dykhne @xcite ( see also earlier work by pokrovskii et al .",

    "\\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    davis and pechukas @xcite have performed an exact proof of result ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "particularly , these authors have proven that the pre - exponential factor equals one .",
    "therefore it is sometimes called the dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) formula . for more than one crossing point with @xmath32",
    "a generalization of ( [ eq4 ] ) has been suggested @xcite and tested by suominen and co - workers ( ref . @xcite and references where - in ) .",
    "a rigorous prove of the generalization of ddp - formula including even _ hermitean _",
    "hamiltonians has been provided by joye et al .",
    "more than one crossing point leads to interferences which generate oscillations in @xmath0 as function of control parameters , like the sweeping rate ( see below ) .    for hamiltonian matrices which are not real - symmetric , but hermitean , berry @xcite and joye et al .",
    "@xcite made an interesting observation which is that @xmath0 obtains also a `` geometrical '' factor besides the `` dynamical '' one , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , where the former also depends on the crossing points @xmath33 , only . for those who are less familiar with this kind of physics",
    "let us explain the choice of this nomenclature .",
    "below we will see that one of the factors of @xmath0 is entirely determined by the adiabatic eigenvalues and the other by the adiabatic eigenstates .",
    "since the former is important for the time evolution it is called `` dynamical '' whereas the latter is related to the geometry in the hilbert space , particularly through a condition for parallel transport ( eq .  [ eq21 ] ) , and accordingly it is called `` geometrical '' .",
    "tls will be influenced by their environment , e.g. by phonons .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling leads to dissipation of the ( pseudo-)spin dynamics which will influence the probability @xmath0 .",
    "although there exist microscopic models for the spin - boson system @xcite , and simplified models where the bath is described by fluctuating fields @xcite , we will use a dissipative schrdinger equation .",
    "this will be achieved by using a _ non - hermitean _",
    "hamiltonian for the tls .",
    "a particular version of such a model has been suggested by akulin and schleich @xcite . in their model ,",
    "called as - model in the following , the upper level ( at the initial time @xmath11 ) experiences a damping ( see section iii ) .    the survival and transition probability for non - hermitean tls - hamiltonians has already been investigated by moyer @xcite .",
    "this has been done by mapping the original differential equation to the weber equation , which can be solved exactly . by use of the weber equation as the appropriate `` comparison equation ''",
    "it was shown how the ddp - formula , eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , can be extended @xcite .",
    "however , this extension does not contain a `` geometric '' contribution , although one expects that it exists similarly to what has been proven for hermitean matrices @xcite . on the other hand garrison and wright @xcite",
    "have investigated the geometrical phase for dissipative systems but not the non - adiabatic transition probability .",
    "it is one of our main goals to derive a generalized ddp - formula in the adiabatic limit containing a `` geometrical '' and a `` dynamical '' contribution for a _ general _ non - hermitean tls - hamiltonian .",
    "we will demonstrate that both contributions consist of a universal and a non - universal part .",
    "the former depends only on the complex crossing points whereas the latter requires the knowledge of the complete time dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "instead of using a `` comparison equation '' we apply the concept of a _ superadiabatic _ basis , put forward by berry @xcite , to non - hermitean tls - hamiltonians . as a result",
    "we will find that the `` dynamical '' contribution to the non - adiabatic transition probability ( which equals the survival probability in the adiabatic limit ) is determined by the complex , adiabatic eigenvalues @xmath34 , only .",
    "the corresponding `` geometrical '' part solely requires the knowledge of @xmath35 ) , the ratio of the components of each of the _ adiabatic _ eigenstates .",
    "a second motivation is the application of our results to the as - model .",
    "it has been shown that the survival probability @xmath0 does not depend on the damping coefficient @xmath4 of the upper level , provided the bias of the tls varies _ linearly _ in time , and the coupling @xmath36 between both levels is time - independent @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate _ non - linear _ time dependence and to check whether or not @xmath5 remains insensitive on @xmath4 . for nonlinear time dependence more than one complex crossing points may occur , such that interference effects can govern the dependence of @xmath0 on the sweeping rate @xcite .",
    "specific examples with @xmath37 for which this happens were discussed in recent years @xcite .",
    "there it was found that critical values for the sweeping rate exists at which the survival probability vanishes , i.e. complete transitions occur between both quantum levels .",
    "consequently , one may ask : are these complete transitions reduced or even suppressed in the presence of damping ?    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section will contain the general treatment of the non - hermitean hamiltonian and the presentation of the generalized ddp - formula . in section iii",
    "we will apply the results from the second section to the as - model with power law time dependence .",
    "the results for the as - model for power law sweeps can be interpreted by the dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "this will be shown in section iv .",
    "a short summary and some conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "in this section , we will derive a generalized ddp - formula for the non - adiabatic transition problem of a decaying tls .",
    "the hamiltonian can be represented as follows    @xmath38    with @xmath39 , the pauli - matrices and @xmath40 a time dependent field .",
    "@xmath41 is the adiabaticity parameter . because this model should be dissipative",
    ", at least one of the @xmath40 must contain a nonzero imaginary part .",
