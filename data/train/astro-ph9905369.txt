    "vapor , liquid and ice ",

    "most of it is contained in the troposphere with a scale height of @xmath1  km , and , because the water vapor is close to its condensation point , it is poorly mixed with the ` dry ' component of the atmosphere ( mostly nitrogen and oxygen ) .",
    "this , in combination with turbulence , leads to a clumpy , non - uniform distribution of water vapor in the troposphere . since the water molecule has a strong dipole moment , rotational transitions couple strongly to millimeter - wave radiation , and water vapor is the dominant source of atmospheric emission ( and therefore opacity ) at most millimeter wavelengths .",
    "liquid water , in the form of clouds , is also a source of non - uniform emission , but radiates much less per molecule .",
    "ice is the least efficient radiator , since the molecules are unable to rotate .",
    "fluctuations in temperature caused by turbulent mixing are also a source of brightness temperature variations , although they are generally much less significant than the water vapor contribution at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "it should also be noted that the high refractive index of water vapor causes an excess propagation delay , and a non - uniform distribution of water vapor distorts an incoming wavefront .",
    "this sets a ` seeing ' limit on interferometric observations at millimeter wavelengths , and there is an ongoing effort to correct for this effect .",
    "it is this problem , which limits performance at arcsecond spatial resolution and high frequencies , that has driven much of the recent research into the distribution of water vapor ( e.g.  armstrong & sramek 1982 ; treuhaft & lanyi 1987 , wright 1996 , lay 1997 ) .",

    "the @xmath59 power law for the two - dimensional regime can be derived from similar scaling arguments to the 3d case , but can not be justified well on theoretical grounds , since turbulence is not strictly possible in a two - dimensional medium  the layer must have some vertical extent  and the model should therefore be regarded as somewhat empirical .",
