    "developing effective theories to describe the non - equilibrium phenomena in quantum systems is of central significance in condensed matter physics and ultracold atom physics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) , which was originally proposed by kibble in cosmology  @xcite , and then by zurek in condensed matter physics  @xcite , has been generalized to describe the driven quantum critical dynamics starting with a state far from the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the driven critical dynamics are controlled by the competition between the energy gap and the external driving .",
    "while the energy gap tends to suppress the excitation from the ground state , the external driving tends to create the excitation .",
    "accordingly , the kzm separates the whole driven process into two adiabatic stages and an impulse stage , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ drivenregion ] . near the quantum critical point , the gap becomes very small and the external driving dominates .",
    "this results in an impulse stage , in which macroscopical excitations are created by the external driving .",
    "in contrast , far away from the quantum critical point , the energy gap is large enough to suppress the excitation and the system evolves adiabatically .",
    "this results in an adiabatic stage .",
    "the kzm demonstrates that the number of topological defects , which are generated during the impulse stage , scales with the driving rate  @xcite .",
    "recently , the kzm has been verified experimentally in trapped - ion systems  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the full scaling forms has been employed to numerically detect the critical properties in both classical  @xcite and quantum phase transitions  @xcite .    for the original kzm ,",
    "it is necessary to have an initial adiabatic stage before an impulse stage to have a frozen correlation length that generates topological defects  @xcite . to go beyond kzm ,",
    "it is important to investigate , both theoretically and experimentally , to what extent the scaling theory should be modified when the initial adiabaticity breaks down . for classical phase transitions , effects induced by a non - equilibrium initial state near the critical point have been studied  @xcite .",
    "however , the conclusion can not be directly generalized to the real - time quantum critical dynamics , because the dynamical properties are intrinsically different in quantum and classical cases . for quantum phase transitions ,",
    "the driven critical dynamics starting exactly from a quantum critical point has been investigated  @xcite . in reality , however , such a scenario is the exception rather than the norm .",
    "studies on driven quantum critical dynamics starting from the vicinity of a quantum critical point are hence called for .",
    "another important issue is the thermal effects in quantum critical dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a scaling theory that includes the temperature has been proposed in ref .  ,",
    "in which the dimensional analysis is used to derive the scaling form but effects induced by the physical procedure to bring the temperature into the dynamics is not considered .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that how the thermal effects are taken into account can affect the dynamic scaling form@xcite . in general , there are two natural setups to include the thermal effects .",
    "one approach is to consider an open quantum system in which the quantum critical system is coupled to an infinite heat bath of temperature @xmath0 . within this approach",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the scaling theory must include the dissipation rate as a scaling variable  @xcite .",
    "the scaling theory is hence different from the theory in ref .  .",
    "the other approach is to consider the critical dynamics in a closed quantum system starting from a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "this approach has been used in refs .  .",
    "however , in these studies the initial state is always the thermal equilibrium state exactly at the quantum critical point .",
    "furthermore , the scaling behavior during the whole driven process has not been discussed therein .",
    "it is thus imperative to investigate whether the scaling theory proposed in ref .",
    "can characterise more general cases of driven dynamics in closed systems .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the quantum critical dynamics of a closed system under an external driving parameterized @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the distance of the relevant parameter to the critical point , @xmath3 is the initial value of @xmath2 and is near the critical point , and @xmath4 is the driving rate .",
    "both zero temperature and finite temperature initial states are considered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ drivenregion ] . by imposing a scale transformation on the master equation",
    ", we propose a general scaling theory .",
    "comparing with the original quantum kzm , we find that this scaling theory includes @xmath3 and the initial temperature @xmath0 as additional scaling variables .",
    "there are two important difference between the present scaling theory and the scaling relation proposed in ref .  .",
    "first , the present scaling theory generalizes the initial condition to the whole scaling regime which is controlled by the fixed point corresponding to the critical point",
    ". in particular , the initial state can be in the impulse region , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ drivenregion ] .",
    "second , it shows that the scaling behavior exists during the whole driven process .",
    "we also point out that @xmath3 plays a crucial role in the driven dynamics when the thermal effects are considered . for small @xmath3 , the scaling behavior for an equilibrium initial state with a finite temperature @xmath0 exists and can be described by our present theory . for very large @xmath3 ,",
    "the initial temperature @xmath0 is irrelevant , and the scaling can be described by the original kzm . in between these two limits , however , the driven dynamics can not be described by simple scaling forms .",
    "these results fill the vacancies of the scaling theory proposed in ref .  .",
    "we confirm our scaling theory numerically by taking the one - dimensional ( @xmath5d ) transverse - field ising model as an example .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sctheory ] , we propose the scaling theory of driven critical dynamics starting in the vicinity of the critical point and compare it with the original quantum kzm . then , in sec .",
    "[ ver ] , we numerically verify the scaling theory by taking @xmath5d transverse - field ising model as an example .",
    "we compare our scaling theory with the previous studies in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider the driven dynamics in a closed quantum system starting with a thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath0 near the quantum critical point . this setup has been considered in ref .  .",
    "recently the rapid advancement of the experimental technologies has enabled us to isolate well a quantum system from the environment  @xcite .",
    "the scenario studied here is hence within the reach of current experiments .",
    "we start from the master equation that governs the evolution of the density matrix of the system :    @xmath6 . \\label{mastereq}\\ ] ]    we assume that the systems starts from the equilibrium thermal state associated with the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the initial density matrix is @xmath7 which is the density matrix of the ground state when temperature is zero .",
    "the evolution of the expectation value for a operator @xmath8 at any temperature is calculated by @xmath9\\}. \\label{expval}\\ ] ]    since the initial position is near the critical point and the driving rate is small  @xcite , the driven process is expected to demonstrate scaling behaviors . to explore scaling properties of the driven critical dynamics ,",
    "we impose a scale transformation , with a rescaling factor @xmath10 on eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) . under this scale transformation  @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14  @xcite , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is unchanged as it is dimensionless . from the dimension of @xmath2 and @xmath17 , one obtains @xmath18 . by replacing the variables in eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) with the corresponding rescaled ones , we obtain the rescaled master equation @xmath19 , \\label{remastereq}\\ ] ] with the rescaled initial condition @xmath20 meanwhile , the rescaled operator @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 , should satisfy @xmath23\\ } , \\label{rescaly}\\ ] ] according to eq .",
    "( [ remastereq ] ) .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ expval ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ rescaly ] ) , we find that the scale transformation of @xmath24 under external driving @xmath1 reads @xmath25    by comparing with the kzm  @xcite one finds that when @xmath26 and @xmath27 the scale transformation  ( [ scay ] ) falls back to the the scaling theory of the original quantum kzm .",
    "the initial stage is an adiabatic stage with correlation length @xmath28 and at @xmath29 the evolution crosses over to an impulse region with correlation length @xmath30 . in this",
    "limit the initial @xmath3 is not a necessary scaling variable .",
    "this is because in the initial adiabatic stage the role played by @xmath3 can be replaced by @xmath2 and the effects induced by @xmath4 can be ignored .    in general , however , there are two non - trivial effects described by eq .",
    "( [ scay ] ) .",
    "firstly , eq .  ( [ scay ] ) is applicable when @xmath3 is in the impulse region , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to the driven dynamics for large @xmath32 , here @xmath3 is an indispensable scaling variable .",
    "this is because the initial gap @xmath33 , which impedes the excitation induced by the external driving , is smaller than the driven energy @xmath34 , which promotes the excitations . as a result ,",
    "there are jumping from ground state to excited states since the beginning .",
    "moreover , the intensity of this initial jump is determined by the competition between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , both @xmath3 and @xmath4 will affect the driven dynamics .",
    "secondly , the initial temperature @xmath0 has been included in eq .",
    "( [ scay ] ) as an additional scaling variable .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath35 the non - trivial scaling behavior only exists when @xmath3 is in the vicinity of the quantum critical point . to clarify this cooperative effect between @xmath3 and @xmath0",
    ", we compare the thermal effects in this case and in other two cases with different @xmath3 .",
    "_ case a : _ for very large @xmath32 and non - zero @xmath0 , the universal behavior is similar to the original kzm in which the driven dynamics starts with the ground state for large @xmath32 .",
    "the reason is that for very large @xmath32 , the initial gap is also very large and the initial thermal excitation can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the following evolution is almost identical to the evolution starting with the ground state due to the unitary property of the dynamics .",
    "accordingly , for large @xmath32 , the initial temperature is irrelevant and the scaling theory falls back to the original kzm . _ case b : _ when @xmath32 is chosen to be a medium value , the thermal effects are of significance but they do not posses any scaling behavior that is determined by the critical point .",
    "the dynamics is quite complicated , because the scale transformation in eq .",
    "( [ reinicon ] ) is not applicable any more . as a consequence",
    "the driven dynamics can not be described by eq .",
    "( [ scay ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath3 is near the critical point as considered above , @xmath0 plays a significant role since the gap is small .",
    "furthermore , the scale transformation imposed on the initial condition , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ reinicon ] ) , is applicable and the dynamics shows scaling behaviors . to sum up we tabulate the results in table .  [ tab1 ] , from which one finds that non - trivial driven scaling behavior with an initial thermal state only exists when @xmath3 is small .",
    "this cooperative effect between the roles played by @xmath3 and @xmath0 has not been discussed in ref .",
    "and our scaling theory makes up this missing link .",
    ".driven dynamics from thermal equilibrium states with different @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    to be explicit , we consider the scaling behavior of the evolution of the order parameter @xmath36 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ scay ] ) , for @xmath1 with @xmath3 being near the critical point , the scale transformation of @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath10 is a rescaling factor . by assuming @xmath38 , we obtain the scaling form of the order parameter , @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 for the present case ) is the scaling function .    for small @xmath3 at zero temperature the driven dynamics of the von - neumann entanglement entropy also demonstrates a scaling behavior affected by the initial conditions .",
    "the von - neumann entanglement entropy is measured as @xmath42 , where @xmath16 is the reduced density matrix of half of the system . for a @xmath5d system near its quantum critical point",
    "it has been show that the entanglement entropy scales as @xmath43  @xcite , where @xmath44 is the central charge and @xmath45 is the correlation length . for @xmath46 , according to eq .",
    "( [ scay ] ) , we can write down the scale transformation of the correlation length , @xmath47 when @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ xisc ] ) gives the scaling form of @xmath45 under the external driving , @xmath49 therefore , the entanglement entropy @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51",
    "in this section , we numerically verify the scaling theory proposed for the universal driven dynamics starting in the vicinity of the critical point .      to illustrate our scaling theory , in the following , we will take the @xmath5d transverse field ising model as an example .",

    "we have set the ising coupling to unity as our energy unit .",

    "according to this algorithm , a quantum state is represented by a matrix product state via vidal s decomposition . in this way , each site is attached by a matrix . the evolution of a state then is realized by the updating of these matrices according to the local evolution operators , which are obtained by the suzuki - trotter decomposition of @xmath69 .    for the driven dynamics starting from a thermal equilibrium state ,",
    "we need to purify the identity matrix @xmath70 into a pure state @xmath71 by introducing an auxiliary system .",
    "the state in this auxiliary system should be maximally entangled to the physical system . in this way , by tracing the freedom in the auxiliary system , the density matrix recovers the identity matrix @xmath70 .",

    "<S> we study the driven critical dynamics with an equilibrium initial state near a quantum critical point . in contrast to the original kibble - zurek mechanism , which describes the driven dynamics starting from an adiabatic stage that is far from the critical point , the initial adiabacity is broken in this scenario . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the scaling behavior can not be described by the original kibble - zurek scaling . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scaling theory , which includes the initial parameters as additional scaling variables , to characterize the scaling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this scaling theory can be used to describe the driven scaling behavior starting from a finite - temperature equilibrium state near a quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically confirm the scaling theory by simulating the real - time dynamics of the one - dimensional quantum ising model at both zero and finite temperatures . </S>"
