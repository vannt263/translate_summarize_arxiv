    "wynn s epsilon method is an acceleration method for series which are converging slowly , as is the case especially for small values of @xmath52 . setting the start values of the algorithm to @xmath166 and @xmath167",
    "the iteration reads @xmath168      as discussed above , each coefficient @xmath122 of the gap is a sum of various nested infinite sums . truncating the infinite sums at a finite limit @xmath66",
    ", one might wonder how the coefficients @xmath122 scale to the infinite - sum limit for different @xmath52 . here",
    "we argue that each term of infinite sums scales similarly to the scaling of a product of riemann zeta functions , which can be derived analytically and is therefore used as the proper scaling of the numerical data sequences .",
    "if one sets @xmath157 in the coefficients @xmath122 relevant for ferromagnetic ising interactions , then all infinite sums become monotonic ( see for example eq .  ) .",

    "if these sums are independent , then one can factorize them and obtains generically a product of harmonic sums of the form @xmath173 each terms scales for large @xmath66 as @xmath174 so that the leading scaling of the product is @xmath175 so all products scale with the same exponent @xmath176 independent of @xmath177 which we also confirmed numerically . in the following we used this scaling for the coefficients @xmath122 of the gap . here",
    "we assume that the nested conditions in the sum , which usually spoil the possibility to factorize the sums , do not alter the scaling behavior .",
    "first , one can rewrite a nested product of sums often as a sum of unnested sums .",
    "second , the term with the largest number of sums arises always from the longest chain graph contributing in a given order and the contribution of this chain graph contains always the factorized product of independent sums .",
    "if one sets @xmath158 in the coefficients @xmath122 relevant for antiferromagnetic ising interactions , then all infinite sums become alternating ( see for example eq .  ) .",
    "we therefore start by considering a single sum of the form @xmath178 and we denote the limiting value of the sum as @xmath179 for @xmath162 .",
    "we are again interested in the leading asymptotics for large @xmath66 of the full sum , i.e.  we consider the difference @xmath180 we then separate odd and even orders corresponding to negative and positive contributions and we assume @xmath7 to be even @xmath181 this sum is again monotonic as above for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "the involved @xmath111 are large , since @xmath66 is supposed to be large .",
    "we therefore perform the taylor expansion @xmath182 for the second term so that the sum is taken over @xmath183 . in the next step",
    "we replace the sum again by an integral and find the following scaling behavior @xmath184 as for the ferromagnetic case , this can be generalized for products of independent sums to@xmath185 where @xmath186 denotes the exact value for @xmath162 .",
    "so all products scale with the same exponent @xmath187 independent of @xmath177 which we also confirmed numerically .",
    "we used this scaling for the coefficients @xmath122 of the gap in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "this section contains an exemplary overview of the extrapolations and scalings of the prefactors @xmath122 ( c.f . ) for both , a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic ising interaction .",

    "they are plotted against @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) for a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) ising interaction .",
    "as derived in the previous section the series of points then should display a linear behavior for large @xmath66 .",
    "the last two points ( corresponding to the largest @xmath66 ) are used to define a linear curve which gives an estimation for the value of the prefactor for @xmath193 .",
    "the curve is shown as a solid green line .",
    "for the calculation of the wynn extrapolants a subset of partial sums @xmath194 is used and shown as red crosses in the figures .",
    "the antiferromagnetic series display an alternating behavior due to the location of the gap at @xmath158 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "only every second value is used to obtain a monotonically converging series .",
    "while they give the general tendency , they deviate from the scaled result considerably when looking at small values of @xmath52 in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "however , we found that the differences between the two extrapolation / scaling schemes do influence the final results for the critical values and exponents only marginally .    for a better comparison of wynn extrapolation and scaling value",
