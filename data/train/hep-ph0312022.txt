    "hard diffraction has triggered a wide interest since its discovery in high energy virtual photon - proton scattering at hera @xcite .",
    "it has been a major theoretical challenge to understand the observed large rate of diffractive events within qcd , especially for large virtualities @xmath0 of the photon ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among the attempts to describe hard diffraction , the dipole picture of qcd @xcite including unitarization corrections @xcite has proved particularly successful and natural in embedding both inclusive and diffractive observables in the same conceptual framework @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct processes contributing to diffractive final states .",
    "a first one consists in the photon splitting in a @xmath2 pair , which scatters elastically off the target without any further radiation .",
    "the final state has typically a low invariant mass @xmath3 , of the order of the virtuality of the photon .",
    "a second contribution is due to the @xmath2 pair interacting through higher fock state fluctuations , for example @xmath4 , which go instead to a large - mass final state @xmath5 .",
    "the latter process is called diffractive dissociation of the photon .",
    "as there is a clear kinematical separation between the two processes , it makes sense to analyse these contributions separately .",
    "the present paper deals with the second one , _ i.e. _ diffractive dissociation .    to select this particular process",
    "one needs a large hierarchy between the mass of the diffractive final state and the virtuality of the photon .",
    "this means in practice that one is forced to relatively low virtuality scales @xmath6 , because of limited total center - of - mass energy available in the experiments .",
    "however , the process can still be computable in perturbative qcd provided that the energy is high enough to push the intrinsic @xmath7 of the partons inside the proton to large values @xmath8 .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the saturation of parton densities @xcite and is now well - understood within qcd @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is called the saturation scale , and is an increasing function of the rapidity of the proton .",
    "the dipole picture is well - suited because color dipoles , which are two - body color neutral objets characterized by their longitudinal momentum , transverse size and impact parameter , are eigenstates of the qcd interaction at high energy .",
    "both elastic scattering ( and thus , from the optical theorem , the total cross section ) and diffractive dissociation have a straightforward formulation in terms of dipoles .",
    "the latter is most simply obtained from the good and walker mechanism @xcite .",
    "our interest in diffractive dissociation is triggered by the wealth of new data that are being taken in the relevant kinematical range at hera .",
    "on the other hand , while some theoretical calculations are already available in the literature @xcite , to our knowledge there has been no phenomenological analysis of this particular kinematical domain within qcd saturation models . ref .",
    "@xcite provides a model also for diffractive dissociation , but the approximations made there allowed only for high virtualities of the photon @xmath10 , therefore the obtained formulae are unapplicable to the recent data at low @xmath0 .    in the following ,",
    "we wish to clearly distinguish what is theoretically well under control and which are the model assumptions that have to be made to come to the description of the hera data . in this spirit",
    ", we will start by providing a complete derivation for the idealized process of diffractive dissociation of a photon on a large nucleus , for which the saturation corrections can be implemented in an easier way .",
    "this will be done in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "some analytical results are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : anres ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we turn to phenomenology and explain how we can adapt the obtained results to photon - proton reactions at hera . we compare our predictions to recently analyzed data .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section , we compute the cross section for diffractive production of a hadronic system of large mass @xmath3 in a highly energetic photon - nucleus collision .",
    "we limit ourselves to diffracted systems which have the following partonic content : @xmath11 or @xmath4 .",
    "higher fock states are indeed not needed for large but still moderate values of @xmath3 .",
    "the target is a large nucleus because , as will be discussed , complete and numerically manageable results can be obtained strictly speaking only in this idealized framework .",
    "we will also stick to the large-@xmath12 limit , and to the semi - classical approximation implied by the high energy kinematics .",
    "we go to a frame ( the so - called dipole frame  @xcite ) in which the photon and the nucleus have respective 4-momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the total squared center - of - mass energy is given by @xmath15 .",
    "through an appropriate boost along the collision axis , the value of @xmath16 is chosen such that the whole diffracted partonic state @xmath17 or @xmath18 is viewed as a quantum fluctuation of the photon which subsequently scatters off the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus contains all partonic fluctuations due to the remaining energy evolution as part of its wave function at the time of the interaction .",
    "this is possible in a frame in which the rapidity of the slowest final - state particle is close to zero . of course",
    ", the observables will not depend on the frame , but our choice provides a physical picture which is particularly adapted to the study of unitarization effects .",
    "the event is diffractive if the nucleus does not break up , which requires the scattering to proceed through the exchange of a color - neutral object .",
    "it was proven @xcite ( for a review , see  @xcite ) that in the dipole frame , the mean transverse momentum of the partons in the nucleus is shifted from @xmath19 to a scale @xmath9 ( the so - called saturation scale ) which increases with the rapidity of the nucleus , due to multiple scatterings and saturation of the parton densities @xcite that occur to preserve the unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "if the energy is large , then the saturation scale can become high enough @xmath20 to justify perturbative calculations for the diffracted partonic system , even if the transverse momenta at the level of the photon , initially of order @xmath1 , are not large .    in the dipole frame ,",
    "the time sequence of the interaction is the following : the photon couples to a @xmath2 pair , which then radiates ( or not ) a gluon before the whole system scatters off the nucleus through the exchange of a color - neutral object .",
    "the leading terms at high center - of - mass energy @xmath21 come about when the ordering in time is strict , _",
    "i.e. _ when the intermediate @xmath2 can be considered an almost on - shell onium state .",
    "the following factorization then holds : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the transverse size of the @xmath2 pair , @xmath24 its impact parameter , and @xmath25 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the antiquark .",
    "@xmath26 is the onium - nucleus diffractive cross section .",
    "the photon wave functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 on a @xmath2 pair are given by @xcite @xmath29 for a transversely and longitudinally polarized photon respectively .",
    "here we sum over both polarizations , but in practice in the kinematical domain of interest ( @xmath0 not too large ) , only the transverse component will be relevant . in the previous formula",
    ", @xmath30 is the mass of quark @xmath31 and @xmath32 thanks to the factorization  ( [ eq : facto ] ) , it will be enough to compute the cross section @xmath26 for diffractive dissociation of an _ onium_. using that formula , we will be able to relate it _ in fine _ in a straightforward way to the deep - inelastic scattering observables .",
    "recalling that @xmath33 is the lightcone momentum of the incident photon , the 4-momenta of the partons in its wave function read @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 from conservation of the 3-momentum .",
    "the transverse momenta @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are of the order of the external mass and/or virtuality scales which we assume all of the same magnitude @xmath40 .",
    "we require furthermore the diffracted system to have a large mass in the sense @xmath5 .",
    "then the squared invariant mass of this partonic system reads @xmath41 and gets large if either @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 are small .",
    "due to the infrared singularity of qcd , @xmath44 is very small in a typical configuration , in which case @xmath45 .",
    "this configuration with strong ordering of longitudinal momenta @xmath46 is the dominant contribution in the kinematical regime of interest .",
    "thus the mass of the diffractive final state is directly related to the _ longitudinal _ momentum fraction of the photon carried by the gluon .",
    "let us now introduce some more kinematics .",
    "the difference between the rapidity of the onium and the rapidity of the slowest particle in the final state is denoted by @xmath47 . if @xmath48 is the fraction of momentum of this particle with respect to the initial - state onium , then it is easy to see that @xmath49 .",
    "one also sees that @xmath50 for a @xmath18 final state .",
    "the total rapidity difference between the photon and the nucleus is denoted by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the bjorken variable .",
    "then one introduces the rapidity gap variable , and grows when @xmath53 decreases . ] @xmath54 and similarly to @xmath48 , the variable @xmath53 such that @xmath55 .",
    "the relationship between these variables and the kinematics of the event reads @xmath56 the quantity which is measured and which will be computed is the differential cross section @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 .",
    "they are related by a simple kinematical factor : @xmath59    the calculation of the cross section for diffractive production of a gluon in onium - nucleus scattering will proceed in two steps . in the next subsection",
    "we compute the elastic scattering amplitude for the onium on the nucleus up to order @xmath60 .",
    "then we will deduce the diffractive cross section from the good and walker formula and with the help of the elastic amplitude .",
    "we only keep the leading terms in a @xmath61 expansion .",
    "then , as well - known , the partonic content of a color neutral object can be represented as a set of dipoles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : largenc ] ) .",
    "@xmath62    we denote by @xmath63 ( a 2-dimensional vector ) the transverse position of the dipole constituent @xmath64 with respect to the center of the target , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the fraction of longitudinal momentum carried by constituent @xmath64 .",
    "the normalization of a generic dipole state is given by the orthogonality condition @xmath67 for two dipoles of respective sizes @xmath68 , @xmath69 and center - of - mass coordinate vectors @xmath24 , @xmath70 . in the following ,",
    "unless it might hamper understanding , one does not keep track of the @xmath25-variables in order to simplify the notations .",
    "the physical dipole state @xmath71 in the initial state of the experiment is dressed with all possible fluctuations .",
    "its expansion in terms of bare fock states reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the probability amplitude that the dipole @xmath74 split in two dipoles of respective sizes @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which corresponds to a 1-gluon fluctuation of the initial onium .",
    "the gluon has longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath77 .",
    "note that @xmath78 is of order @xmath79 , and the higher fock states not written are at least of order @xmath80 : this remark provides the systematics for this fock - state expansion , seen as a perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath79 .",
    "this expansion is relevant since @xmath79 is small because it runs with a scale between @xmath9 and @xmath1 , which we have both assumed much larger than @xmath19 .",
    "also , note that the 2-dipole state is not renormalized to this order , but would get renormalized from higher orders .",
    "the quantity that will appear in the calculation of observables is the squared wave function , summed over the polarizations and colors of the final - state gluon , whose expression can be found in @xcite : @xmath81 from the unitarity condition  ( [ eq : norm ] ) applied to the physical state @xmath71 in  ( [ eq : phys ] ) , one can compute the renormalization constant @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 cuts off the ultraviolet divergences and @xmath48 the infrared ones . in practice ,",
    "as it should be @xmath84 disappears from physical quantities , and @xmath48 is fixed by the kinematical limit .",
    "note that @xmath82 represents physically the probability that the initial onium does not radiate any gluon .",
    "let us denote by @xmath85 the scattering matrix of the onium on the nucleus .",
    "color dipoles form an orthogonal basis of the interaction eigenstates at high energy , thus the @xmath86-matrix element between two dipole states reads @xmath87 the quantity @xmath88 is the probability that a dipole of size @xmath68 at impact parameter @xmath24 does _ not _ interact with the target .",
    "the @xmath53-dependence of this quantity reflects the high energy evolution of the target .",
    "the @xmath86-matrix element between two double dipole states reads @xmath89 the notation is the following : @xmath90 is the elastic diffusion matrix element for states formed of two adjacent dipoles of respective sizes @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 is the probability that neither @xmath75 nor @xmath76 interact , which under the assumption that the dipoles interact independently is the product of the probabilities that @xmath75 and @xmath76 do not interact , @xmath93 .",
    "the latter assumption is justified when the target is a large nucleus , since nucleons are color - neutral and independent .",

    "the reason why we are relying on such a picture , developed in the context of early hadronic physics @xcite and subsequently extended to the parton model @xcite , is that the dipoles form precisely a complete set of eigenstates of the qcd interaction at high energy .",

    "this time , the first domain gives the main contribution which reads @xmath223 and which is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath162 ( recall that the integral over the vector @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath162 ) .",
    "this can be illustrated graphically .",
    "as one goes to smaller @xmath0 , @xmath224 stays constant for lower values of @xmath200 , and develops a plateau @xcite , as seen on eq .",

    "this plateau contains configurations for which the longitudinal momentum of the photon is equally shared between the quark and the antiquark . on the other hand , @xmath225 is roughly a constant for @xmath226 and drops rapidly to zero for @xmath227 .",
    "hence once @xmath0 is small enough to allow the plateau of the photon wave function to extend up to dipole sizes of the order of @xmath228 , the cross section does not increase anymore when @xmath0 decreases , and tends to a constant .",
    "the precise value of the constant is model - dependent .",
    "these features are specific to the transverse photon and to the purely diffractive cross section .",
    "we are going to apply the formalism developed above to deep - inelastic scattering at hera .",
    "our starting point is eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmadiffgamma ] ) .",
    "to go from scattering on a nucleus to scattering on a proton , one has to take some model assumptions for the non - perturbative physics inherent to the target and that are not under theoretical control .",
    "first , we assume that the incident dipole is always much smaller than the target proton , which is reasonable for @xmath0 not too small compared to @xmath229 .",
    "we also consider a cylindrical target , _",
    "i.e. _ we neglect all dependence upon impact parameter .",
    "as far as we do not consider observables which would depend on the momentum transfer to the proton , this assumption only hampers predictivity for the global normalization , and brings a significant technical simplification .",
    "although we are now dealing with a proton , we still keep the hypothesis of independence of dipole interactions in the derivation of eq .",

    ", we choose to stick to the golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) model @xcite for the dipole - proton @xmath86-matrix , which reads @xmath231 where @xmath232 in units of @xmath233 and @xmath234 is the radius of the proton , related to a normalization parameter in gbw model by @xmath235 .",
    "@xmath173 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 were fitted to the data for the total structure function @xmath238 in ref .",

    "the integration over the impact parameter that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmadiffgamma ] ) can be performed , and yields a factor @xmath242 .",
    "in addition , in the gbw model , three light quarks were considered , and a mass of @xmath243 was assigned to them , to ensure a sensible extrapolation to photoproduction .",
    "we take over this feature to our model .",
    "we find useful for numerical evaluation to rewrite the onium diffractive dissociation cross section as @xmath244 where @xmath245 . through an appropriate change of variable",

    ". we must set @xmath79 to a lower value @xmath254 .",
    "however , the fact that we do not predict correctly the global normalization does not come as a surprise . indeed ,",
    "first , the ( non - perturbative ) assumption of a cylindrical target is certainly not realistic .",
    "second , we took the size of the cylinder over from the normalization of the cross section fitted to total cross sections .",
    "because diffractive dissociation is resonant with the saturation scale , the impact parameter region which contributes to the cross section should be effectively smaller , which would go in the right way as far as the normalization is concerned .",
    "our predictions are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . as our model",
    "is established in the limit of small values of @xmath48 , we choose to restrict our calculation to @xmath255 .",
    "this explains why our curves do not extend to very large @xmath0 , especially at @xmath256 .",
    "we see that we get a good agreement with the data .      on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we see that the cross section tends to a constant at low @xmath0 , as anticipated in sec.[sec : lim ] .",
    "this was shown to be due to the fact that @xmath257 also tends to a constant at low @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] , which is unavoidable when the initial state is a transversely polarized photon .",
    "the consequence is that the high sensitivity of these diffractive observables to the exact form of the @xmath86-matrix in the saturation region is somewhat spoiled by this smearing .",
    "however , this property is not true for a longitudinally polarized photon .",
    "alternatively the plateau at small @xmath201 can also be eliminated by considering the derivative of the cross section with respect to @xmath258 , namely @xmath259 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] . a measurement of this quantity would help the understanding of the @xmath86-matrix in the saturation regime , by enabling a direct scan of this interesting region . a more detailed study will be provided elsewhere .",
    "diffraction is a good place to study saturation effects in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "it had already been shown that quasi - elastic diffractive scattering , like vector meson production , enables to measure how far one is from the unitarity limit and gives a handle on the impact - parameter dependence of the saturation scale @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have provided a theoretical tool to study `` true '' ( inelastic ) diffraction in the saturation regime .",
    "we have formulated the diffractive cross section for a general model for the dipole - proton @xmath86-matrix , and we have rederived an already known formula in an elegant way using the good and walker picture .",
    "when we take for @xmath163 the golec - biernat and wsthoff model , we obtain parameter - free predictions ( up to the global normalization ) for the observable @xmath260 currently measured with good precision at hera .",
    "an important highlight of our analysis is that diffractive observables can help to discriminate in a unique way between the predictions of different models in the saturation region .",
    "this point deserves more studies , that we leave for the future .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the formalism used here based on the dipole model could be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of gluons in the final state .",
    "this program has already been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite but no unitarity corrections were taken into account .",
    "our method allows to take into account these corrections .",
    "whether a simple evolution equation in @xmath48 would be found is not clear .",
    "anyway , the available energies at present colliders do not require yet such higher fock states , nor the complete resummation of all leading logs , _ i.e. _ of the powers of @xmath261 .    on the phenomenological side",
    ", it would be worth to take into account more accurately the dependence upon impact parameter , which is of great importance in the whole discussion of saturation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could replace the gbw ansatz for the dipole @xmath86-matrix by kowalski - teaney @xcite recent model , which takes into account the transverse profile of the proton .",
    "this replacement might be necessary in order to describe accurately enough the high precision preliminary data , and we would have a prediction also for the normalization of the cross section instead of tuning it as we have done here .",
    "furthermore , more exclusive observables like @xmath262 , which will be measured in the future could be predicted .",
    "in this appendix , we compare our approach ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxlargeqcs ] ) ) to the impact factor used by golec - biernat and wsthoff for @xmath4 final states .",
    "the latter is formally valid only for @xmath140 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the collinear limit .",
    "the two calculations should however lead to the same result when both @xmath140 and @xmath263 , which is the so - called double logarithmic limit .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffractive structure function reads @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the adjoint dipole - proton cross section , and @xmath266 is the exponential @xmath267-slope of the differential cross section : @xmath268    one can extract the leading contribution to this cross section in the @xmath269 limit .",
    "it comes from the integration region @xmath270 .",
    "using @xmath271 and performing the sum over helicities @xmath272 , one gets @xmath273 the integral over @xmath25 is now factorized and gives just a factor @xmath274 in the limit @xmath269 .",

    "the following expression results : @xmath279 where we have defined @xmath280 and @xmath281 is the angle of vector @xmath121 , @xmath282 is the dipole cross section after change of variable .",

    "the leading contribution to the second term is @xmath292 .",
    "the coefficient of this logarithm is the value of @xmath31 at zero , namely @xmath293 putting everything together back into eq .",
