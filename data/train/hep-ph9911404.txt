    ", the origin of this divergence can be clarified by performing an ope for the total , rather than the differential , rate @xcite . including dimension six operators in this ope one finds a four fermion operator of the form @xmath116 contributing to the rate . in @xcite the matrix element of this operator was calculated at leading order in perturbation theory by integrating out the @xmath117 quark and its contribution to the total rate",

    "it is clear from ( [ cleobranchingratio ] ) that the @xmath130 contribution is large , and relaxing the positivity constraint on @xmath130 enlarges the uncertainty to about 20% .",
    "a similar statement can be made regarding the @xmath147 analysis @xcite where the phase space cut is slightly higher , and the nonperturbative corrections are correspondingly somewhat larger . since the cut on @xmath125 can not be lowered because of the @xmath148 resonance , these uncertainties are intrinsic to our approach in the large dilepton invariant mass region .",
    "it is important to notice that in the invariant mass region below the @xmath127 resonance , the uncertainties from these matrix elements are much smaller .",
    "for example , integrating the differential spectrum up to the cut specified in the cleo analysis @xcite @xmath149 we find @xmath150 it is still true that the coefficient of the @xmath130 term is @xmath151 times larger than that of the @xmath3 term , but both sets of nonperturbative corrections are small relative to the parton level result in this region .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that new physics can modify this spectrum , so it is interesting to see how @xmath1 terms contribute to the sm prediction .    integrating the triple differential decay rate ( [ triplelepdiff ] )",
    "we find @xmath155 here we have again omitted the trivial dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear from this expression that the third order terms do not have abnormally large coefficients , and therefore introduce only small variations relative to the second order expression .",
    "an experimentally more useful quantity is the normalized fb asymmetry defined by @xmath156 unfortunately , this normalized asymmetry has inherited the poor behavior of the differential branching ratio in the endpoint region . in fig .",
    "[ asymm ]    = 10 cm    we illustrate the uncertainties of the normalized fb asymmetry originating from the matrix elements of the dimension six operators .",

    "we can see that up to a value of @xmath158 the uncertainties are small , but for larger values of the dilepton invariant mass the uncertainties increase rapidly .",
    "because of the necessity of the cut to eliminate the @xmath124 resonances , the accessible high dilepton invariant mass region is therefore restricted to a few hundred mev . for the dilepton invariant mass region below the @xmath127 resonance @xmath159 the uncertainties are small .",
    "throughout this paper we have fixed the values of the leading non - perturbative parameters @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath24 .",

    "it is interesting to ask how severely our ignorance of the values of the @xmath1 parameters compromises our ability to extract the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 from such a measurement .",
    "it has been suggested by ali and hiller @xcite that one use the first two moments of the hadron invariant mass spectrum defined by @xmath160 this idea is similar to the approaches used in the semileptonic @xmath161 @xcite and the rare radiative @xmath15 decays @xcite , though the experimental task is more difficult in this case due to the small size of the branching ratio . to calculate these hadronic moments",
    "we relate them to calculable partonic moments via @xmath162 where we have used the mass relation @xmath163 appropriate at this order in the ope .",

    "however if the differential forward - backward asymmetry is normalized to the differential rate , the resulting spectrum contains large uncertainties in the high dilepton invariant mass region . in the region of phase space below the @xmath127 resonance , however , we find the nonperturbative corrections to be small .",
    "finally we addressed a recent proposal suggesting that hadron invariant mass moments of the differential spectrum for @xmath0 could , due to the sensitivity of these moments to nonperturbative effects , be used to constrain the values of the hqet parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the low @xmath182 region",
    "the moments are suppressed relative to the rate and , considering the already tiny branching ratio , it is unlikely that experimental measurements in this region will be forthcoming .",
    "therefore we focused our attention on the high invariant mass region . in this region , we found that the first of these moments @xmath174 provided a constraint in the @xmath175 plane , but that this constraint was nearly the same as those derived from other , more experimentally promising , processes , and therefore seems to be of limited interest for this purpose .",
    "as for the second invariant mass moment @xmath172 , we found that the nonperturbative uncertainties were such that it was not possible to extract a stable constraint on the values of @xmath4 or @xmath3 .",
    "from these results , we conclude that these moments are not well suited to the extraction of these parameters .",
    "we would like to thank michael luke for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science and engineering research council of canada .",
    "in this appendix we present the form factors @xmath86 .",
    "these form factors have been calculated previously up to @xmath75 @xcite , and we do not reproduce those results here .",
    "we decompose the new contributions arising at @xmath97 as @xmath183 for completeness we have included the full @xmath104 dependence in these expressions , though in our analysis we set @xmath184 . defining @xmath185 with @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 ,",
    ", we find that the third order contributions are @xmath189",
    "in this appendix we present the dilepton invariant mass spectrum for a finite @xmath32-quark mass @xmath114 .",
    "the spectrum originating from operators of dimension @xmath57 has been presented in eq . ( 47 ) of @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the time - ordered operators @xmath31 can be obtained by making the replacement ( [ tsubs ] ) in this equation .",
    "since the dilepton invariant mass distribution is independent of the definition of the four velocity of the heavy quark , the contribution proportional to @xmath190 is related by reparameterization invariance @xcite to the @xmath24 contribution .",
    "it can be obtained by the replacement @xmath191 in the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , the only term we have to add to the existing literature to obtain the complete expression including all @xmath112 contributions is the term originating from the darwin operator whose matrix element is @xmath130 .",
