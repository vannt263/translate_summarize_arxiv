    "historically , many works have been devoted to constructing quantum theories of gravitational collapse .",
    "one of the motivations is to resolve the problems concerning the final fates of black hole evaporation due to the hawking radiation@xcite , which may lead to the paradox of information loss@xcite .",
    "however , quantum gravity itself includes not only technical difficulties but also conceptual ones such as the interpretation of wave function , the nature of time and the definition of observables .",
    "since any fully consistent theory is not yet established , the present step would be to develop various useful toy models to shed a new light on some features of quantum effects of gravity .",
    "in particular , quantum gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric shell , on which we focus our attention in this paper , has been studied as one of such toy models@xcite .    in this model",
    ", one can consider the spherically symmetric spacetime which is in vacuum except the delta - function distribution of incoherent dust shell at a finite circumference radius . by the virtue of the spherical symmetry ,",
    "the inner side of the shell may be a minkowski spacetime and the outer one is the schwarzschild spacetime which has a finite gravitational mass parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the divergence of the energy momentum tensor of the dust shell tells us the shell can be characterized by a constant of motion which are called the rest mass @xmath1 .",
    "the two vacuum regions should be joined at the shell according to the einstein equations .",
    "this program can be accomplished by using israel s junction condition@xcite , which works as the equation of motion of the dust shell , and the dynamical variable is limited to the circumference radius @xmath2 of the shell and the global structure of spacetime can be classified by the value of @xmath3 .    the original idea to quantize this dynamical system",
    "was proposed by berezin et al.@xcite .",
    "if any quantum effect of incoherent dust shell is ignored , this matter shell can be characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "both the vacuum regions in the spacetime are also classically treated .",
    "then , only the equation of motion of the shell which can be regarded as the energy equation is quantized by constructing the hamiltonian operator .",
    "although the hamiltonian operator to be constructed is not unique , berezin et al . investigated the hamiltonian operator , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the planck mass ( throughout this paper we denote the planck constant by @xmath7 and use units such that @xmath8 ) and the time coordinate describing the shell dynamics is chosen to be the proper time of a comoving observer .",
    "then , they obtained the spectrum of the eigenvalues @xmath9 of @xmath10 , @xmath11 by using wkb approximation where @xmath12 is a non - negative integer . from their analysis , it is unclear that the spectrum ( [ berezin - e ] ) is also valid when @xmath13 .",
    "however , hjek et al.@xcite gave a definite formula of the spectrum @xmath9 adapting a simpler equation for the wave function .",
    "they introduce the super - hamiltonian on an extended minisuperspace which leads to the `` wheeler - dewitt '' equation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the minkowskian time of the inner side of the shell . investigating this equation",
    ", they obtain the formula of @xmath9 for the bound states defined by @xmath16 , @xmath17 nevertheless the two quantum treatments arrive at the same conclusion when @xmath18 , ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) becomes meaningless when @xmath19 which means classical limit can not be obtained from this eigenvalue . furthermore , it is shown that in the bound states only the black hole formation corresponding to the range @xmath20 is allowed , while the wormhole formation corresponding to @xmath21 is possible as classical solutions .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to clarify the relation between quantum and classical spacetime of this system . for this purpose , we pay attention to the time slicing on which the quantum mechanics is developed .",
    "note that the previous treatments are essentially based on the comoving time slicing .",
    "it is also possible to construct quantum mechanics on the other time slicing .",
    "since the canonical formalism is based on the decomposition of spacetime into space and time , a special attention must be paid to the problem of time slicing which determines the foliation of spacetime .",
    "furthermore it is well - known in classical relativity how a description of black hole spacetime depends on the choice of time slicing : in the usual static chart the schwarzschild horizon plays a role of the infinite redshift surface , while in the synchronous chart corresponding to a freely falling observer it is not any special surface@xcite .",
    "this means that the horizon can be regarded as a sort of boundary of the foliated spacetime only for a static observer .",
    "so the foliation of spacetime or the choice of observers in the spacetime is more important when one consider a black hole spacetime .",
    "to study the quantum mechanics of dust shell collapse , we use various time slicings in hope that the physical essence is independent of the time slicing .",
    "the black hole horizon is not a special surface for an observer who uses the proper time along the shell history or the minkowskian time .",
    "however , a static observer outside the horizon will require a different boundary condition for the wave function due to the existence of the horizon for him . by developing quantum mechanics for a static obsrever",
    ", we can obtain the mass spectrum which corresponds to ( [ berezin - e ] ) and ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we will show that wormhole states are also possible for a static observer who stays inside the wormhole but when @xmath1 is same order of @xmath6 no wormhole state is allowed owing to the zero - point fluctuation of the shell motion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : eqofmotion ] , we derive the classical equation of motion of the shell in terms of various observers who define time slicings on the shell trajectory in spacetime .",
    "although infinitely many observers or time slicings can be assumed in general , we restrict our consideration to a one - parameter family which contains two typical time slicings corresponding to the gaussian normal coordinates of a comoving observer and the static schwarzschild coordinates of an observer who stays at a finite circumference radius , and derive the possible spacetimes as the solutions of the einstein equations . in sec.[sec : canqua ] , we introduce the hamiltonian constraint which corresponds to the time - time component of the einstein equations and gives the equation of motion in a similar manner to the wheeler - dewitt procedure . following the earlier works ,",
    "we solve classically the einstein equations except the hamiltonian constraint for the shell motion .",
    "this means that the momentum constraint is classically treated just like many minisuperspace models .    in sec.[sec : eigen ] , we consider the quantum mechanics of collapsing shell , by using the one - parameter family of time slicings introduced in the previous sections and we also discuss the global structure of spacetime in which the dust shell collapse forms .",
    "our main result will be obtained under the static time slicing .",
    "furthermore , our consideration is restricted to the so - called bound states @xmath22 , which have the discrete mass eigenvalues , and we must consider the cases @xmath23 and @xmath24 separately in the static time slicing , these cases correspond to the black hole states and wormhole states respectively .",
    "then , we discuss the relation between quantum and classical solutions of this system and show that there is no quantum states when @xmath24 and @xmath25 . we also consider the quantum mechanics on non - static time slicing to confirm that our arguments are natural extension of the result obtained in the comoving frame .",
    "it can be shown by the fact that the quantum version of the hamiltonian constraint becomes identical with the radial equation of ( [ hajicek - wd ] ) in the comoving limit .",
    "finally , our consideration was summarized in sec.[sec : sum ] .",
    "although our simple model is a preliminary approach to quantum gravity , it would give a useful clue when one investigates the problem of time slicing in a more complete theory .",
    "in this section , we derive the equation of motion for a collapsing dust shell , which is described by various time slicing .",
    "since the spacetime is spherically symmetric , one can choose the metric of the form @xmath26 where @xmath2 is the circumference radius and @xmath27 is the metric of unit 2-sphere .",
    "for this metric matter fields depend on @xmath28 and @xmath29 which are time and radial coordinates .",
    "furthermore the spacetime is assumed to be in vacuum except the @xmath30-function matter distribution at a finite circumference radius .",
    "we denote the world volume of this spherically symmetric shell as @xmath31 which is a ( 1 + 2)-dimensional hypersurface . in a neighborhood of @xmath31",
    ", one can choose the gaussian normal coordinates@xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the proper time which would be measured by an observer comoving with the shell .",
    "the coordinate @xmath34 is the proper distance from @xmath31 along the geodesics which are orthogonal to @xmath31 , and @xmath31 is assigned to the world volume of @xmath35 . imposing the spacetime to be orientable on @xmath31 , we may regard one side of @xmath31 as being the `` outer side '' ( @xmath36 ) and the other side as being `` inner side '' ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the whole spacetime is constructed by connecting the schwarzschild spacetimes of the outer side and the minkowski spacetime of the inner side .",
    "the einstein equations give the `` junction condition '' for the neighborhood of @xmath31 , which is well - known as israel s formula@xcite . in the case of the minkowski - schwarzschild junction ,",
    "the nontrivial conditions are given by@xcite , @xmath38 = - \\frac{\\mu}{r},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;        [ \\partial_{\\tau}a ] = 0 ,            \\label{nontrivial - junction}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the partial derivative with respect to its subscripted coordinate , and @xmath40 represents all the metric functions on the spacetime .",
    "the bracket @xmath41 $ ] means the difference of @xmath40 between the outer and inner sides , @xmath42=\\lim_{\\eta \\rightarrow + 0}a - \\lim_{\\eta \\rightarrow -0}a.\\ ] ] the first equation of ( [ nontrivial - junction ] ) contains the total energy of dust shell defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the surface energy density of the dust shell . from the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor of dust shell",
    ", one can easily see that @xmath1 is a constant of motion .    for our convention of calculation ,",
    "let us introduce quasi - local mass defined by @xmath45 which is conserved in each vacuum region of the spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "of course , @xmath46 in the minkowski side , and @xmath47 in the schwarzschild side represents the gravitational mass of the shell .",
    "the formula ( [ eqn : hawking - mass ] ) is useful to estimate the derivatives of @xmath2 in both sides , which are involved in ( [ nontrivial - junction ] ) .",
    "now we discuss the time slicings to describe the shell motion .",
    "`` time slicings '' usually mean foliations of a whole spacetime .",
    "foliations are spaces in a spacetime in which one can set observers . in our model , however , the equation of motion for the collapsing shell can be reduced to a local equation on @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the necessary procedure is to set a radial direction of coordinate system near @xmath31 , which is called `` time slicing '' in this paper .",
    "let us denote the radial coordinate by @xmath48 and rewrite the metric into the form @xmath49 we can refer to a local observer near @xmath31 whose world line is along a constant @xmath48 .",
    "there are two typical observers .",
    "one is a comoving observer corresponding to the time slicing @xmath50 .",
    "the world line of this observer is embedded in @xmath31 .",
    "another is a static observer who stays at a constant circumference radius @xmath51 ( @xmath52 in ( [ semi - general - metric ] ) ) .",
    "we call the above time slicings `` comoving slicing '' and `` static slicing , '' respectively .",
    "our idea is to give a more general form of the time slicing as follows , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant parameters at the outside the shell .",
    "this form is useful because one can recover the static and comoving time slicings by choosing the parameters to be @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively . except the special cases the time slicing corresponds to an observer who is not comoving with the shell but infalling toward the origin @xmath58 . in the following",
    "we will study the parameter dependence of the equation of the shell motion in both classical and quantum levels .",
    "the first task is to rewrite the junction condition ( [ nontrivial - junction ] ) using the coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath59 .",
    "the general coordinate transformations from ( [ eqn : comoving - spherically ] ) into ( [ semi - general - metric ] ) should be @xmath60 the boost angle @xmath61 is related to the velocity of the shell in the @xmath62 frame as follows @xmath63 where the subscript @xmath34 means the derivative along a line of constant @xmath34 . in this frame",
    "the junction conditions ( [ nontrivial - junction ] ) are given by @xmath64 = - \\frac{\\mu}{r } u \\cosh\\phi,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;        [ ( \\partial_{t}r)_{x } ] = - \\frac{\\mu n}{r}\\sinh\\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath48 are treated as independent variables in the calculation of the partial derivatives .",
    "on the other hand , because the quasi - local mass @xmath0 defined by ( [ eqn : hawking - mass ] ) invariant under the coordinate transformation ( [ coordinate - trans-1 ] ) and ( [ coordinate - trans-2 ] ) , it must satisfy with the conditions @xmath65 in the schwarzschild side , and @xmath66 in the minkowski side . by the virtue of the time slicing ( [ eqn : gauge - choice ] ) and the coordinate transformations ( [ coordinate - trans-1 ] ) and ( [ coordinate - trans-2 ] ) , we obtain the relations @xmath67 if the metric components @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the coordinate system @xmath62 are assumed to change continuously at the shell , substitution of ( [ rela - dev-2 ] ) and ( [ rela - dev-3 ] ) into ( [ gene - junc ] ) leads to @xmath70 = \\frac{\\mu\\xi}{r},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; [ \\xi ] = 0.\\ ] ] note that the parameter @xmath71 at the outer side must be different from @xmath72 at the inner side .",
    "since we are interested in an observer located at the outer side of the shell , only @xmath73 is treated as a parameter for specifying the time slicing .",
    "then @xmath74 becomes a function depending on @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , ( [ general - mass - p ] ) and ( [ general - mass - n ] ) for the quasi - local mass in both sides are rewritten into the forms @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . if @xmath74 and @xmath61 are omitted from eq.([eqn : finaljunction ] ) , ( [ eqn : outmassver2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : inmassver2 ] ) , we obtain the metric component @xmath77 which shows that @xmath78 in the comoving time slicing ( @xmath79 ) , while @xmath80 in the static time slicing ( @xmath81 ) . the velocity of the shell motion measured by the time coordinate @xmath59 should be defined by @xmath82 .",
    "then , by using ( [ eqn : boost - angle ] ) , ( [ rela - dev-1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : outmassver2 ] ) and ( [ u - inverse ] ) , we arrive at the final form of the equation of motion @xmath83 where the potential @xmath84 is given by @xmath85^{2}}\\right ) ,          \\label{general - potential}\\\\        v_{\\infty } & = & 1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(2e + \\frac{\\mu}{r}\\right)^2 ,        \\label{comoving - potential }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath86 and @xmath9 are constants defined by @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively . in the limit @xmath89 ,",
    "the potential @xmath90 coincide with @xmath91 in the comoving system .",
    "this represents the motion of the shell described by an observer corresponding to the time slicing parameter `` @xmath86 '' who is accelerated against gravity produced by the shell .",
    "it is worth noting that the metric component @xmath92 can not be determined by the junction conditions .",
    "the reason can be seen in the proof of birkhoff s theorem@xcite . when one chooses @xmath2 to be the radial coordinate , the vacuum einstein equations for the spherically symmetric vacuum spacetime give @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an arbitrary function of @xmath59 .",
    "the factor @xmath94 may be eliminated by using the coordinate transformation @xmath95 .",
    "however , one can not determine this function by the einstein equations .",
    "since the junction conditions are local conditions , all the metric components on the shell depend only on the time coordinate @xmath59 , and the lapse function @xmath96 is treated as an arbitrary function by the virtue of the gauge freedom @xmath94 of a choice of @xmath59 by a local observer . in the next section ,",
    "we develop the canonical quantum theory using this arbitrariness of @xmath97 .    before discussing the quantization procedure , it is better to give the brief derivation of the classical solution of this system , since the vacuum spacetimes in the outer and inner regions of the shell are classically treated . in the comoving frame",
    ", the difference of the quasi - local mass between the outer and inner sides of @xmath31 leads to the formula @xmath98 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "then the junction conditions ( [ nontrivial - junction ] ) allow us to write explicitly @xmath99 and @xmath100 as follows , @xmath101 because the classical motion for bound states is limited in the range , @xmath102 the derivatives @xmath100 and @xmath99 must satisfy the condition @xmath103 the equalities hold just at the turning point @xmath104 of the shell motion . recall that @xmath105 are proportional to the components of the extrinsic curvatures @xmath106 of @xmath31 of the outer and inner sides .",
    "hence , @xmath107 is always positive , while @xmath108 becomes negative when @xmath24 .",
    "the signs of @xmath106 are essential to the global structure of spacetime constructed by the junction of the outer and inner spacetimes . in the range of @xmath9 given by @xmath21 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the junction clearly shows a wormhole formation and a black hole formation , respectively ( see fig.[fig:1])@xcite .",
    "the gravitational mass @xmath0 can be also negative , even if the local energy condition @xmath109 is imposed , and it does not contradict to the positive mass theorem @xcite because it has no asymptotically flat region and has a timelike singularity at the schwarzschild side .",
    "thus the relation between the value of @xmath9 and the global structure of spacetime is very clear , and we use this relation also in quantum mechanics of the shell , in which the motion is specified by a discrete eigenvalue of @xmath9 .    [ fig:1 ]",
    "now we give the hamiltonian which generates the equation of motion given by ( [ general - equation - of - motion ] ) .",
    "the procedure is to use the gauge freedom previously mentioned .",
    "although the hamiltonian is not uniquely determined , we seek the simplest one here . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the lagrangian for ( [ general - equation - of - motion ] ) @xmath110 because ( [ lagran ] ) does not include @xmath111 , there is a primary constraint that is the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath97 must weakly vanish .",
    "furthermore , there is a secondary constraint which can be obtained by the variation of ( [ lagran ] ) with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to confirm that the secondary constraint coincides with ( [ general - equation - of - motion ] ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation which can be derived by the variation with respect to @xmath2 is the first derivative of ( [ general - equation - of - motion ] ) .",
    "because we have the lagrangian ( [ lagran ] ) , the usual step of the canonical formalism leads to the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath2 @xmath112 and the hamiltonian @xmath113 we wish to emphasize that ( [ general - equation - of - motion ] ) is a result of the hamiltonian constraint @xmath114 which is generated by the variation with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "our model can keep the property of a constrained system in a similar manner to the full canonical theory of general relativity .    the next step is to quantize the hamiltonian constraint given by @xmath115 if we use the usual commutation relation @xmath116=i\\hbar$ ] and the simplest factor ordering , ( [ hamicon - classical ] )",
    "is reduced to the schrdinger equation , @xmath117 where potential @xmath90 is given by ( [ general - potential ] ) and has the form @xmath118(1 - e^2)}{(\\lambda +          e)^2}\\frac{(r - r_{0})(r - r_{1})(r + r_{2})}{r(r - r_{3})^2},\\ ] ] and the constants @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given by @xmath123 let us explain some implications of these radii . because of the condition @xmath124 of the bound state , the classical motion of the shell has the maximum radius @xmath120 which corresponds to a turning point . in the time",
    "slicing parameterized by @xmath86 , the classical motion has also the minimum radius @xmath125 where the infinite redshift occurs for the corresponding observer .",
    "note that @xmath119 is equal to @xmath126 in the static limit @xmath127 , which coincides with the true horizon radius . from the potential ( [ general - potential-2 ] )",
    ", @xmath125 is a turning point of the shell . since the wkb feature , in general , breaks down at turning points , this means that the semiclassical description become meaningless at @xmath125@xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath90 diverges at @xmath128 where we obtain the regular singular point of the differential equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) .",
    "this radius @xmath122 becomes smaller than @xmath119 , if the inequality @xmath129 holds .",
    "then , we can consider the region @xmath130 in ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) , which is classically forbidden and disappears only in the comoving limit @xmath131 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath132 ) . only when @xmath133 there exist the additional bound states with @xmath9 in the range @xmath134 , for which we obtain the classically allowed region @xmath135 and classically forbidden regions @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    "this situation is similar to the quantum field theory in a rindler spacetime , in which both sets of mode functions in the left- and right - handed wedges together are complete on all of minkowski space@xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) means that we have the hilbert spaces @xmath138 of @xmath139 which depends on the time slicing parameter @xmath86 , in particular , as a consequence of the existence of the classically forbidden region @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 when @xmath142 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "hence , for each @xmath86 , we can give a discrete set of the eigenvalues of @xmath9 , which is the unique observable in this quantum system .",
    "because the vacuum spacetimes outside and inside the shell are classically treated , the global structure of the whole spacetime is specified only by @xmath9 .",
    "then the hilbert space can be regarded as a set of spherically symmetric spacetimes ( such as black holes , wormholes ) which the collapsing shell forms .",
    "in this section , we study the quantum mechanics on various time slicings using the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) . we mainly consider the static time slicing @xmath127 and then the other time slicing is considered to confirm that our argument is the natural extension of that in @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the typical time slicing which corresponds to a static observer . when @xmath143 , the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) can be written in the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 as previously mentioned , for the bound states in the range @xmath20 , only the bounded region @xmath146 is classically allowed .",
    "though a quantum penetration of the wave function is possible in the region @xmath147 , it must stop at @xmath128 owing to the infinite potential barrier .",
    "therefore the boundary conditions which we adopt here is that the wave function vanishes at @xmath128 and @xmath148 .",
    "although it is difficult to solve ( [ eqn : lam=0equation ] ) exactly , an approximate calculation of the eigenvalue @xmath9 is possible .",
    "notice that the factor @xmath149 satisfies the inequality , @xmath150 since the wave function is defined in the region @xmath151 . as will be seen later ,",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath9 is in the range @xmath20 .",
    "then , the factor @xmath152 remains nearly constant in ( [ eqn : lam=0equation ] ) .",
    "then , introducing the non - dimensional variable @xmath153 , @xmath154 the approximate form of ( [ eqn : lam=0equation ] ) can be written as follows , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is treated as a constant , and @xmath157 the general solution is a superposition of the two wittaker s function @xmath158 and @xmath159 , one of which is defined by @xmath160 the boundary condition at @xmath161 selects the unique solution @xmath162 which exponentially decrease as @xmath153 increases and is written by the superposition @xmath163 now another boundary condition at the regular singular point @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) determines the eigenvalue @xmath9 .",
    "the behavior @xmath166 in the limit @xmath167 means that @xmath139 can satisfy the boundary condition only when @xmath168 because the @xmath169-function does not vanish on the real axis . since the @xmath169 function has poles at non - positive integers , this condition is reduced to @xmath170 where @xmath12 is a non - negative integer . from ( [ spectrum - formula - schi ] ) we can give the limiting behavior of the mass eigenvalue : in the limit @xmath171 , @xmath172 if @xmath173 , ( [ eqn : nlargm - mass ] ) corresponds to the spectrum ( [ berezin - e ] ) obtained by berezin@xcite and ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) hjek et al.@xcite in the limit @xmath174 of highly excited states . on the other hand in the opposite limit @xmath175 ,",
    "the quantum effect becomes more important , and we have @xmath176    [ fig:2 ]    although the spectrum of @xmath9 obtained here is consistent with the assumption @xmath20 , the validity can be also checked by numerical calculation of ( [ eqn : lam=0equation ] ) , which is based on the standard shooting method of solving two - point boundary - value problems@xcite . in fig.[fig:2 ]",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are plotted for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , which corresponds to the quantum numbers of @xmath12 which runs from @xmath179 to @xmath180 .",
    "we note that the approximate spectrum ( [ spectrum - formula - schi ] ) coincides with the numerical results within the accuracy of our numerical code if choosing the constant @xmath173 in ( [ eqn : nlargm - mass ] ) and @xmath181 in the case of ( [ eqn : nsmalm - mass])@xcite .",
    "hence we can claim that ( [ spectrum - formula - schi ] ) is useful to discuss the qualitative behavior of the spectrum @xmath182 .",
    "the behaviors of the spectrum of @xmath9 written by ( [ eqn : nlargm - mass ] ) and ( [ eqn : nsmalm - mass ] ) are plausible as a quantum version of gravitational collapse . recall that @xmath12 is the quantum number of the shell motion , and @xmath183 can be regarded as the gravitational binding energy per unit rest mass energy .",
    "we can find that the gravitational binding energy remains small when the kinetic energy of the shell motion dominates the inertia of the shell ( @xmath184 ) , while the binding energy becomes large when the inertia dominates the kinetic energy .",
    "for the ground state ( @xmath185 ) we obtain @xmath186 in the limit @xmath187 , which corresponds to the classical limit of black hole formation .",
    "the quantum zero - point fluctuations generate the term @xmath188 in ( [ eqn : nsmalm - mass ] ) , where @xmath156 is taken to be equal to @xmath189 .",
    "the contribution of this zero - point fluctuations can seriously affect the motion of the shell , if @xmath190 is not so large .",
    "note that the restriction @xmath191 which is required in the comoving time slicing disappears in this static time slicing .",
    "this is a consequence of the inner boundary condition . in this static time slicing , the central singularity is hidden by the infinite redshift surface , and the inner boundary condition is set up at a finite @xmath2 . hence we can construct quantum mechanics of the collapsing dust shell without taking account of `` information loss '' at the central singularity .",
    "the eigenvalues ( [ spectrum - formula - schi ] ) ( or ( [ eqn : nlargm - mass ] ) , ( [ eqn : nsmalm - mass ] ) ) shows that the global structure of spacetime which corresponds to these eigenvalues is limited to only a black hole formation , _",
    "i.e. _ the wave functions which has a support only in @xmath192 corresponds to the black hole states(fig1.(a ) ) .",
    "this does not means that there is no wormhole state .",
    "when @xmath24 , we can also consider the wave function whose support exists only in @xmath193 . in this case",
    ", the classically allowed region also exists in @xmath194 where the inequalities @xmath195 holds due to the condition @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", one can not use the approximation that @xmath156 defined by ( [ black - hole - assumption ] ) is nearly constant .",
    "so , we must numerically solve the schrdinger equation ( [ eqn : lam=0equation ] ) and the result is shown in fig.[fig:3 ] : for fixed @xmath190 , the eigenvalue of @xmath9 monotonically decreases in the range @xmath21 as @xmath12 increases .",
    "these eigenvalues plotted in fig.[fig:3 ] corresponds to the global structure of a wormhole formation _",
    "i.e. _ the wave function whose support exists only in @xmath193 corresponds to the wormhole states(fig.[fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "when @xmath196 , there are many bound states whose eigenvalues of @xmath9 satisfy the inequality @xmath24 . together with the case @xmath23 , we can take the limit to the positive mass classical solutions of bound state in which @xmath9 takes an arbitrary value in @xmath197 .",
    "this situation is similar to the quantum field theory in rindler spacetime .",
    "note that there is no bound state in @xmath198 , and wormhole spacetimes do not exist in the case @xmath199 due to the zero point fluctuations of the shell motion .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    we must also note that the state of @xmath200 is forbidden like the case @xmath24 .",
    "it can be also seen from the necessary condition for the existence of bound states .",
    "let us denote the minimum value of the potential @xmath90 by @xmath201 which depends on @xmath9 .",
    "since we impose the boundary condition @xmath202 , all eigenvalues @xmath9 of bound states must satisfy the condition @xmath203 when @xmath204 , we obtain @xmath205 .",
    "then the inequality is reduced to @xmath206 , which can not be satisfied when @xmath207 .",
    "furthermore we can give a physical interpretation of @xmath208 .",
    "the classically allowed region is @xmath194 , and @xmath209 as @xmath186 , so the shell is confined in this narrow region .",
    "however , it is impossible due to the uncertainty relation @xmath210 , thus @xmath200 is forbidden due to the quantum effect of the shell motion .",
    "based on the result obtained in the static time slicing , we consider the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) in the case @xmath211 except that there is no bound states in the region @xmath193 when @xmath212 . any essential property of ( [ general - schrodinger ] )",
    "is not so much different from the case @xmath143 , and we also impose the boundary condition ; the wave function must vanish at the regular singular points @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "then , we can derive the eigenvalues @xmath9 in a similar manner .",
    "the approximation that @xmath215 is constant in ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) leads to @xmath216 in the limit @xmath217 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath86-dependence of @xmath9 is not so sensitive in the limit @xmath218 .",
    "however , the approximated form ( [ eqn : n0lambda - nlargm - mass ] ) will not remain valid as @xmath86 become infinitely large . to clarify the behavior of @xmath9 for the ground states in the limit @xmath219",
    ", we must solve numerically the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) . by varying the parameter @xmath86",
    ", we can consider the extrapolation from the static time slicing to the comoving one .",
    "in particular , for @xmath220 , we can compare the spectrum of @xmath9 with ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) in the comoving limit .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath177 are plotted in fig.[fig:4 ] , which confirm that the mass spectrum converges to ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) as @xmath86 increases and @xmath9 remains larger than @xmath221 . on the other hand , as an example of the spectrum for @xmath222 , the eigenvalues @xmath9 for @xmath223 are plotted in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "we find the common tendency that the energy level at the ground state decreases as @xmath86 increases .",
    "the remarkable point for @xmath222 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath224 ) is that the mass spectrum does not keep the condition of @xmath23 nevertheless the wave function has its support only in @xmath225 .",
    "as was suggested in @xcite , even the states of @xmath226 are allowed , if @xmath86 is sufficiently large .",
    "( this might means that @xmath10 in ( [ b - h ] ) can not be positive self - adjoint operator in general . )",
    "then observable states exist in the range @xmath227 when @xmath1 is sufficiently larger than @xmath6 , and these correspond to the global structure of black hole and wormhole formations ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig:4 ]    [ fig:5 ]    finally , we consider the wave function given by the schrdinger equation ( [ general - schrodinger ] ) in the comoving frame.(@xmath89 ) , which has the form @xmath228 note that this schrdinger equation corresponds to the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ hajicek - wd ] ) , and our schrdinger equation may be regarded as a natural extension of ( [ hajicek - wd ] ) . in terms of the requirement of unitarity and of positivity of energy ,",
    "hjek et al@xcite gave the boundary condition that for the bound state @xmath229 the wave function must vanish at the origin and at infinity .",
    "then the discrete spectrum of @xmath9 was shown to be ( [ comoving - eigen ] ) which becomes meaningless when @xmath230 .",
    "as discussed by hjek et al .",
    ", this means that when @xmath222 one can not impose the positivity of @xmath9 or the regularity of the wave function at @xmath58 . in our approach the regularity of wave function at @xmath165",
    "are set up in any time slicing parameter @xmath86 , even if @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , we can discuss the comoving limit through the extrapolation of the results to the range @xmath231 . in this sense ,",
    "as previously mentioned , observable states exist in the range @xmath227 when @xmath1 is sufficiently larger than @xmath6 , there is no essential differences in a set of observable states . on the other hand , there are no wormhole states @xmath232 when @xmath233 .",
    "these states are suppressed by the zero point fluctuations of the shell motion .",
    "in summary , by studying this model of dust shell collapse , we obtained the wave function for the bound states with positive eigenvalues of @xmath9 under the static time slicing .",
    "when @xmath234 , these can recover the classical solutions which describe wormhole or black hole formation .",
    "one may regard the regions @xmath193 and @xmath192 as left- and right- handed wedge of rindler spacetime respectively in a similar way to the quantum field theory in rindler spacetime@xcite : the set of classical solution with positive eigenvalues of @xmath9 in our model corresponds to the complete set of mode functions in whole minkowski spacetime , and black hole and wormhole states correspond to the mode functions in left- and right - handed wedge respectively .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the wormhole states can not exist when @xmath235 as a result of the zero point fluctuations of the shell motion . for a comoving time",
    "slicing also , we can see the same quantum effect .",
    "although it is not unclear whether @xmath226 is permissible or not , observable states exist in the range @xmath236 when @xmath19 , while only black hole states are possible when @xmath233 .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that the wormhole formation with small mass is efficiently suppressed in the quantum collapse of dust shell .",
    "then , in our model , it is difficult to create small wormhole due to the quantum fluctuations of the shell motion .",
    "although the @xmath86-dependence of @xmath9 is not so essential to the set of observalbe states in our argument , to set a time slicing , we can easily see the relation between observalbe states and geometries ( wormhole states or black hole states , etc . ) .",
    "this means that the time slicing or observers in a spacetime plays an important role when one classify the observable states in quantum theory of gravity . since",
    "quantum theories are based on the cauchy problem and , usually , the configuration space of quantum gravity is three - space geometries , we must specify a set of observers or initial time slicing at first to clarify the set of observable states . in this sence , the notion of the time slicing or observer will become to be more important in a fully consistent quantum gravity .",
