    "the evaluation of the fermion determinant in lattice field theories poses a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "in particular for an odd number of flavors , or when a chemical potential is added , no fast numerical algorithms are known . as a possible way out",
    "several studies of alternative representations of the fermion determinant in terms of fermion loops can be found in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "loop representations are not only useful as a tool for numerical simulations , but also provide interesting insights into the nature of the fermion determinant , in particular they provide a solution of the fermion sign problem ( compare @xcite for recent developments ) . at least for abelian gauge fields it is furthermore possible to perform a duality transformation for the link variables and in 2 dimensions they can even be integrated in closed form .",
    "the resulting representation in 2-d is a discrete sum over filled wilson loops .",
    "the historic approach to finding a loop representation for the fermion determinant is to first expand the boltzmann factor for the fermions .",
    "since the fermions are represented by grassmann variables the power series for the boltzmann factor has only finitely many terms . in a second step the grassmann integral at each site",
    "is saturated with all possible combinations of the terms from the series for the boltzmann factor .",
    "the result can be viewed as a sum over closed loops of links .",
    "we remark , that for gauge theories products of link variables arranged along closed loops are the only possible gauge invariant terms and thus structures of closed loops can be expected already from gauge invariance .",
    "the local saturation of the grassmann integral is however a tedious algebraic problem .",
    "thus most of the results were obtained for staggered fermions where the additional structure due to spinorial degrees of freedom is avoided @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the resulting model however still describes more than one fermion due to the doubling problem , which is only reduced but not completely eliminated by the staggered formulation .",
    "the first result for wilson fermions is salmhofer s mapping of the strongly coupled schwinger model to a 7 vertex model @xcite .",
    "the techniques used there were later generalized by scharnhorst and applied to the strongly coupled schwinger model with 2 flavors and the 2-d lattice thirring model @xcite .",
    "thus for purely fermionic models in 2-d also loop representations for wilson fermions have been found for some models .",
    "however , no loop representation for the fermion determinant in an external field has been found for wilson fermions while for the staggered case such results are known @xcite .    in a recent publication",
    "we have attacked this problem using a new approach @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to first perform a hopping expansion of the fermion determinant ( see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction and @xcite for an application to the schwinger model ) .",
    "the hopping expansion essentially gives a loop representation for the free energy of fermions in an external field .",
    "thus it already provides the natural variables for the loop representation .",
    "the remaining problem is to expand the boltzmann factor in order to bring down the loops from the exponent . in @xcite",
    "this method has been applied to the case of 2-d wilson fermions interacting with an external scalar field through a yukawa coupling .",
    "+ in this article we treat the case of the lattice schwinger model with wilson fermions using the hopping expansion technique . the fermion determinant in the external u(1 )",
    "gauge field will be written as a sum over oriented loops dressed with the gauge variables sitting on the links of the loops . in this representation",
    "we then integrate explicitly the gauge fields and the partition function turns into a discrete sum over filled wilson loops .",
    "vacuum expectation values of wilson loop type observables can easily be taken into account by adding the wilson loops to the loops from the determinant before integrating the gauge fields .",
    "vev s of local fermionic observables ( scalars and vectors ) also turn out to have rather simple expressions in the loop formalism .",
    "they can be obtained by differentiating the fermion determinant ( before performing the gauge field integration ) with respect to the mass term for the scalars or with respect to the link variables for the vectors . in the loop picture",
    "these observables then correspond to the loop flow through sites ( for the scalars ) and links ( vectors ) .",
    "thus in a numerical simulation of the loop model the evaluation of n - point functions for these observables becomes exceedingly simple .",
    "finally we remark , that a chemical potential can be included in a natural way by giving the pieces of loops running forward in time a weight different from the weight for pieces running backward in time .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we rederive the hopping expansion of the fermion determinant in a form which is convenient for our later manipulations . in section 3",
    "we expand the boltzmann factor and construct the loop representation of the determinant .",
    "this is done by first analyzing several examples for different contributions and subsequently the general rules of the loop calculus are discussed . in the end of section 3",
    "we also briefly address the role of a chemical potential . in section 4",
    "we discuss the relation of our new representation to known results which can be obtained as limiting cases of our formulas .",
    "in particular the coupling to an external yukawa field and the strongly coupled schwinger model are considered . in section 5",
    "we integrate out the gauge fields and give the final representation for the partition function of the lattice schwinger model with wilson fermions in terms of filled loops . in section 6",
    "we discuss the loop representation of some observables and the article ends with a discussion in section 7 .",
    "we study the lattice schwinger model with wilson fermions .",
    "in addition to the gauge fields we also couple a real scalar field @xmath0 to the fermions through a yukawa - type interaction .",
    "the scalar field @xmath0 will serve as a tracking device for the algebraic manipulations below and also allows for a consistency check by comparing our new representation with the known loop representation for the yukawa - type coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition we will use @xmath0 as a source term for generating n - point functions .",

    "@xmath5 u(1 ) are the link variables supported on the links @xmath6 of the lattice , with @xmath7 , i.e.  for hopping in backward direction the link variables are complex conjugate .",
    "the sum in the bilinear form runs over the whole lattice , @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that our lattice @xmath9 is a finite rectangular piece of zz@xmath10 with open boundary conditions , i.e.  hopping terms that would lead to the outside of our lattice are omitted .",
    "we remark that all our results also hold for @xmath9 being a cylinder with a compact time direction with anti - periodic boundary conditions and open boundary conditions for the space direction .",
    "such a geometry is interesting for analyzing the model at finite temperature .",
    "let s define @xmath11 and assume that @xmath12 is such that @xmath13 for all lattice points @xmath14 .",
    "this is a purely technical assumption due to the particular techniques we use for computing the determinant .",
    "the final result will be a finite polynomial in the @xmath12 and the above restriction is irrelevant then .",
    "we now can write for the fermion determinant @xmath15 in the last step the hopping expansion was performed , i.e. the determinant was expressed using the well known trace - logarithm formula and the logarithm was expanded in a power series .",
    "the hopping matrix @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 the series in the exponent of ( [ hopexp ] ) converges for @xmath18 , and the whole expression represents the determinant then ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown for the case of @xmath19 , that @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this argument and prove that for our case we have @xmath20 for @xmath22 . to summarize : the series in ( 2 ) converges for @xmath22 and the right hand side of ( [ hopexp ] ) represents the determinant for this range of parameters .    due to the kronecker delta in ( [ hoppingmatrix ] )",
    ", the contributions to tr@xmath23 are supported on closed loops on the lattice , and since closed loops are of even length ( for the cylinder geometry discussed above we assume an even length for the compact direction ) , the contributions for odd @xmath24 vanish .",
    "for even @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the set of all closed , connected loops of length @xmath28 and base point @xmath14 . in the first product",
    "we collect all the link variables @xmath29 on the links visited by the loop according to their orientation . the last term in ( [ hoptrace ] )",
    "is the trace of the ordered product of the hopping generators @xmath30 as they appear along the loop @xmath31 .",
    "we remark , that @xmath32 , which implies that whenever a loop turns around at a site and runs back along its last link this contribution vanishes .",
    "thus all these _ back - tracking _ loops can be excluded from @xmath33 .    evaluating the trace over the matrices @xmath30 for a given loop is the remaining problem in the hopping expansion .",
    "it first has been solved for the infinite lattice in @xcite by realizing that the pauli matrices give rise to a representation of discrete rotations on the lattice .",
    "alternatively one can build up the loops using four basic steps and compute the trace in an inductive procedure along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the latter method can be extended to the case of lattices with compact dimensions . when choosing a cylinder with anti - periodic boundary conditions in time direction and open b.c .",
    "for the space direction the result equals the result for the rectangular lattice with open boundary conditions .",
    "thus the result for both of the discussed sets of boundary conditions is @xmath34 by @xmath35 we denote the number of self - intersections of the loop @xmath31 and @xmath36 gives its number of corners .",
    "we remark , that for e.g.  a torus additional sign factors for topologically non - trivial loops would appear .",
    "the result ( [ gtrace ] ) is independent of the orientation of the loop . inserting ( [ hoptrace ] ) and ( [ gtrace ] ) in ( [ hopexp ] ) we obtain @xmath37 in the second step we removed the explicit summation over the base points .",
    "a loop of length @xmath28 without complete iteration of its contour allows for @xmath28 different choices of a base point thus canceling the factor @xmath38 in the previous expression .",
    "a loop which iterates its whole contour @xmath39 times allows only for @xmath40 different base points and a factor @xmath41 remains ( compare @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we defined @xmath42 to be the set of all closed , connected , non back - tracking loops of arbitrary length .",
    "note that each loop comes with both of its orientations and the factors from the link variables for the two orientations are complex conjugate to each other .",
    "the final expression ( [ finalhop ] ) for the hopping expansion performed in the last section is the starting point for the identification of the loop representation for the determinant in this section .",
    "as already outlined in the discussion above we will proceed by expanding the boltzmann factor .",
    "this expansion converges and represents the determinant when the sum in the exponent converges , i.e.  for @xmath22 as discussed above .",
    "the resulting series converges even absolutely and the reordering of terms which we perform below is justified ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we approach the expansion by first discussing several examples which will be used to extract the general algebraic rules for the different terms along the way .",
    "keeping track of the terms in the taylor expansion of the boltzmann factor is most easily done by using the actual contours of the loops associated with the different terms .",
    "so let s first look at the different contributions to the sum in the exponent of the boltzmann factor . in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] we show some of the terms as they appear in the exponent .",
    "= 8.4 cm    the first two terms are two loops around a single plaquette and they differ only in their orientation .",
    "note that each of these two loops ( similarly for all loops shown ) is only a representative for all loops around a single plaquette , the other loops differing by a translation , i.e. winding around any other single plaquette of the lattice .",
    "these first two loops both have four corners thus giving rise to a geometrical factor of @xmath43 .",
    "certainly there are also the factors from taking the product of the link variables around the plaquette .",
    "these are however not relevant for the following discussion and thus are not displayed explicitly .",
    "we show only the corner- , self - intersection- and iteration - factors .",
    "next we plot another rectangular loop , but now enclosing six plaquettes . again",
    "the corner - factor is @xmath43 .",
    "the fourth term is a loop enclosing two plaquettes but now having a pinch structure .",
    "this loop has eight corners and no self - intersection such that its geometrical weight is @xmath44 . the next term we show is again a loop enclosing the same two plaquettes , the lower plaquette however is now run through with opposite orientation .",
    "this loop has one self - intersection , but only 6 corners , thus producing a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "note that also the weight from the link variables ( not displayed in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] ) differs from the last contribution since the lower plaquette now has negative orientation and the link variables for this plaquette are complex conjugate .",
    "next we show a loop which runs around a single plaquette twice .",
    "it has eight corners and one self intersection .",
    "in addition we have to take into account a factor of @xmath46 since the loop iterates its contour twice .",
    "the total factor then is @xmath47 .",
    "finally we show another loop with a self - intersection .",
    "it consists of 2 loops around single plaquettes connected by a double line along two links .",
    "it has one self - intersection and 8 corners such that the geometrical factor is @xmath48 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] we display only a few terms which are useful for the discussion of some examples below .",
    "it is however straightforward to depict arbitrary terms from the series in the exponent of ( [ finalhop ] ) and to determine the corresponding geometrical factors .",
    "+ let s now perform the expansion of the boltzmann factor in ( [ finalhop ] ) .",
    "we will proceed as follows : in the figures below we show on the left hand side some configuration of links as it appears in the final representation , i.e.  after the boltzmann factor has been expanded .",
    "these contributions in their final form will however be built from different loops and their products , emerging when expanding the boltzmann factor .",
    "these different terms are shown in the middle of the figures below , together with their geometrical weights .",
    "the total weight associated to the graph depicted on the left hand side is the sum of the weights for all contributing terms .",
    "we give this number on the right hand side , separated by an arrow .",
    "we remark that the expansion of the boltzmann factor will produce contributions consisting of several disconnected pieces located on different positions of our lattice . up to the combinatorial factors which will be discussed below , disconnected pieces in different areas of the lattice",
    "do not communicate with each other .",
    "our examples thus concentrate on the different terms locally building up a contribution .",
    "the inclusion of disconnected pieces located elsewhere is a trivial generalization .",
    "= 1.18 cm    in fig .",
    "[ example1 ] we show a loop which consists only of the four links around a single plaquette . as is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ finalhop ] ) and its geometrical representation in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] , there is only one contribution in the taylor expansion of the boltzmann factor giving rise to this contribution .",
    "it is the first loop depicted in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] .",
    "furthermore only the linear term in the power series for the exponential function produces this term since for higher powers , this loop would be multiplied with other loops .",
    "thus we find only one term on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ example1 ] .",
    "the total weight for this term is the same as we had in the exponent , namely @xmath43 .",
    "= 1.3 cm    next we consider a contribution where a loop iterates it s contour twice ( fig .",
    "[ example4 ] ) . in particular we consider the simplest such term , i.e.  the configuration where all links around a simple plaquette are occupied twice .",
    "this configuration firstly can be resolved with a single connected loop .",
    "this loop has eight corners and one self - intersection which produces a minus sign .",
    "in addition we have to take into account a factor of @xmath46 since this loop completely iterates its contour twice .",
    "the overall factor thus is @xmath47 .",
    "secondly the configuration can be resolved as the square of the loop which runs around our plaquette only once .",
    "each of the single loops has four corners giving a total corner factor of @xmath44 .",
    "in addition one has a factor 1/2 which is the factor for the quadratic term in the power series of the exponential function .",
    "putting things together we find that the two contributions cancel each other .    this type of cancellation which we have seen in the simple example of fig .",
    "[ example4 ] is the manifestation of a general rule : whenever a term contains a loop which iterates its complete contour twice the contribution gets canceled .",
    "the general argument goes as follows : let @xmath49 be the loop which iterates its contour twice . assume , that it appears in a contribution which also contains @xmath50 other loops @xmath51 , which are located somewhere else on the lattice .",
    "this contribution then appears in the @xmath24-th power term of the taylor series for the exponential function .",
    "the corresponding factor is : @xmath52 the @xmath53 factor on the left hand side comes from the power series for the exponential function . then follows a minus sign from the self - intersection of @xmath49 and a factor of @xmath46 since @xmath49 iterates its contour twice .",
    "next we have the corner factor for @xmath49 followed by the factors @xmath54 for the other loops ( corner , self - intersection- and iteration - factors ) .",
    "finally we find a combinatorial factor of @xmath55 which gives the number of different ways the @xmath24 terms can be arranged .",
    "since @xmath49 iterates its contour twice , the same contribution can also be obtained by squaring a loop @xmath56 which has the same contour as @xmath49 , but runs through it only once .",
    "this contribution then appears in the @xmath57-th power term of the taylor series for the exponential function and comes with a factor of @xmath58 here the factor of @xmath59 is gone , since we have no self - intersection and also the contour is not run through twice by a single loop .",
    "the corner factor stays the same since @xmath60 .",
    "finally the combinatorial factor changes to @xmath61 , where the factorial gives the number of ways the @xmath57 terms can be arranged .",
    "however , @xmath56 appears twice , such that we have to divide by 2 .",
    "thus we find that ( [ iterfact1 ] ) is exactly the negative of ( [ iterfact2 ] ) .",
    "this proves that whenever a loop iterates its contour twice it can be matched with a contribution which has the opposite sign and gets canceled .    in principle",
    "one can extend this proof and show via induction that all contributions , where a loop completely iterates its contour more than once , get canceled .",
    "there is however a simpler argument .",
    "it is based on the fact , that not more than two lines can flow through a site . to understand this we have to remember that each occupied link carries with it a factor of @xmath62 as can be seen from the last product in ( [ finalhop ] ) .",
    "thus when @xmath24 loops run through a site @xmath63 they produce a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "combined with the overall factor of @xmath65 we find @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath24 exceeds 2 , i.e.  more than two loops run through a site , this term is no longer polynomial . on",
    "the other hand one finds by direct evaluation that the expression for the determinant on the finite lattice is a polynomial in @xmath67 .",
    "using the fact that for @xmath22 the series represents the determinant ( compare the discussion above ) we conclude , that all vertices where more than 2 lines run through a site have to vanish .",
    "this implies that loops which iterate their contour more than twice can not contribute and for the case of the doubly iterated loop we have given the explicit argument for its cancellation above , thus showing that eventually none of the iterating loops in the exponent contributes .    before we go back to the discussion of further examples ,",
    "let s bring in another harvest from the discussion in the last few paragraphs : the factors @xmath53 from the taylor series of the exponential function always get canceled and the combinatorial factor simply is 1 .",
    "this can be seen as follows : for a contribution which is the product of @xmath24 loops one finds that only terms where @xmath24 different loops are multiplied can contribute ( if a loop could appear more than once we would have loops which are multiply occupied , a case which we have just excluded ) .",
    "these products come with a combinatorial factor of @xmath55 , which gives the number of ways the terms can be arranged .",
    "it cancels the factor of @xmath53 from the taylor series for the exponential function .",
    "thus the algebraic factor is always equal to 1 .",
    "+    after this combinatorial excursion let s go back to discussing more examples .",
    "next we analyze a graph with two nested loops ( fig .",
    "[ example2 ] ) .",
    "there is only one contribution in the expansion of the boltzmann factor giving rise to this graph .",
    "it is a product of two loops , i.e.  it comes from the quadratic term in the taylor series for the exponential function .",
    "thus it has a factor of @xmath46 which is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the taylor series .",
    "however , for our graph two different loops have to be multiplied , making our contribution a cross term which comes with a factor of 2 canceling the factor @xmath46 from the power series .",
    "each of the two loops has 4 corners giving rise to a geometrical factor of @xmath44 .",
    "this is already the final factor associated with the contribution depicted on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ example2 ] .",
    "= 4.38 cm    in fig .",
    "[ example3 ] we look at a graph which contains the same links , but the orientation of the inner loop has been reversed .",
    "in addition to the contribution from a product of two loops , similar to the last example , the new configuration also allows for a single connected loop running through the chosen set of links .",
    "this term is produced by the linear term of the power series for the exponential function and thus simply has an algebraic factor of 1 .",
    "the geometric factor is @xmath68 , since the loop has eight corners and one self - intersection .",
    "the product contribution has the same factor as in the last example .",
    "the two contributions cancel each other .",
    "[ example3 ] demonstrates another general rule of our loop calculus : the final expression will not contain any terms where a link is occupied twice with the same orientation . whenever we compute the weight for such a graph we find that the different terms in the expansion of the boltzmann factor cancel each other . in fig .",
    "[ example3 ] this is demonstrated in an example , but let s give the general argument : whenever we have a configuration where along at least one link two lines run parallel with the same orientation , then there are two ways to resolve this configuration with terms coming from the expansion of the boltzmann factor .",
    "one contribution where the two lines do not cross and one with a crossing .",
    "both contributions have the same number of corners , the latter one however obtains an extra minus sign due to the additional self intersection .",
    "the two terms thus cancel each other .",
    "we remark that at some other parts of our loop there also might be structures which can be resolved in different ways .",
    "however , already one link which is run through twice in the same direction leads to a vanishing of this contribution ( compare also the discussion of completely iterated loops given above ) .",
    "this exclusion of contributions with links which are run through twice in the same direction can be interpreted as a manifestation of the pauli principle which forbids two excitations of the same state .",
    "next we concentrate on how a configuration containing an intersection can be resolved in different ways . the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ example5 ] shows a configuration which contains two plaquettes with opposite orientation which share a common corner .",
    "there is one possibility to run around the two plaquettes in a single loop .",
    "this contribution comes from the linear term in the taylor series for the exponential function and has eight corners thus acquiring a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "our two plaquettes can also be obtained as the product of two loops , i.e.  a contribution appearing in the quadratic term of the power series .",
    "again we have a total of eight corners giving a factor of @xmath44 and when adding this to the coefficient of the linear term we find an overall factor of @xmath69 .    in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ example6 ] we now have reverted the orientation of the lower plaquette .",
    "certainly this configuration will still have a contribution from the quadratic term of the exponential function where it is written as a product of two loops .",
    "the geometrical factor is the same as in the last example .",
    "however , the linear term , where our contour appears as a single connected loop , has to be changed .",
    "it now has only six corners but one self - intersection and thus a factor of @xmath45 . adding this to the coefficient of the product term we find an overall factor of @xmath68",
    "finally we discuss ( fig .",
    "[ example7 ] ) the contribution which corresponds to the last loop shown in fig .",
    "[ exponentloops ] .",
    "it can not be decomposed into the product of two loops and thus is entirely built from the linear term in the expansion of the exponential function .",
    "the factor @xmath68 is simply taken over from the exponent . although not very interesting from a combinatorial point of view , this example demonstrates another important point . in order to avoid overcounting of self - intersections , we have to introduce a normal ordering for double lines with two flows in opposite direction ( the case of lines with equal direction has already been ruled out above ) .",
    "we always draw a line that flows from left to right above a line which flows from right to left . for vertical double lines",
    "we adopt the convention that downward flowing lines are drawn on the right hand side of upward flowing lines .",
    "after having analyzed several of these examples one finds that the contributions on the left hand side can be decomposed into finitely many elements and all contributions which appear in the expansion of the boltzmann factor can be built from these elements .",
    "we view these elements as tiles with some configurations of oriented lines drawn on these tiles ( compare fig .  [ tiles ] ) .",
    "the tiles can now be arranged on our rectangular lattice such that ingoing and outcoming flow lines on neighboring tiles match each other . to each tile",
    "we assign a weight @xmath70 and the total weight of a configuration is given by the product of all weights for the tiles which were used in building the configuration .",
    "when summing over all possible ways of different tilings of our lattice ( placing the centers of the tiles on the sites of the lattice ) we reproduce all possible fermion loops contributing to the fermion determinant .",
    "the concept of writing partition functions as a sum over tiles ( vertices ) was first introduced in @xcite and these models are known as vertex models ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining problem is to assign the correct weights to our tiles .",
    "from the example shown in fig .",
    "[ example1 ] we find that a simple corner has to be assigned a factor of @xmath71 which gives the weights @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ tiles ] . fig .",
    "[ example2 ] shows that tiles with a straight line ( @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ tiles ] ) obtain a factor of 1 .",
    "the same factor has to be assigned when two straight lines run anti - parallel ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the example discussed in fig .",
    "[ example7 ] furthermore shows that antiparallel flow lines have to be normal ordered and our convention is to draw flow lines from left to right above flows from right to left and downward flows are draw right of upward lines . from fig .",
    "[ example2 ] we learn , that tiles with a straight line and a corner ( @xmath75 in fig .  [ tiles ] ) have a factor of @xmath71 and an additional minus sign if the normal ordering of the double line enforces a crossing .",
    "similarly one finds that tiles with two corners ( @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ tiles ] ) have a factor of @xmath77 , again with an additional minus sign if a crossing occurs .",
    "[ example4],[example3 ] and the general argument given there establish that all tiles which contain two lines running parallel in the same direction must have vanishing weights ( these tiles are not displayed in fig .",
    "[ tiles ] ) . from figs .",
    "[ example5],[example6 ] we find that for tiles showing two crossing lines we have to assign a factor of @xmath59 when the crossing can be resolved with a self - intersecting loop ( @xmath78 ) and a factor of @xmath79 when no self - intersecting resolution is possible ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "finally we also have to include the empty tile ( @xmath81 ) which has a factor of 1 . in fig .  [ tiles ]",
    "we give a complete list of all 49 tiles with non - vanishing weights .",
    "we remark that tiles with an odd number of incoming or outgoing lines of flow can not appear , since all contributions come from products of closed loops and thus the net flow into a site has to vanish .",
    "furthermore not more than two lines can run through a vertex as follows from the fact that the determinant is a polynomial in the local mass terms ( see the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ iterfact2 ] ) ) .",
