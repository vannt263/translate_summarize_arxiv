    "nowadays , thanks to the nanofabrication technique , detailed experimental studies of the electron coherence in mesoscopic superconducting systems become possible , where the andreev reflection @xcite plays an important role in the low energy transport . in diffusive normal metal / superconductor",
    "( dn / s ) junctions , the phase coherence between incoming electrons and andreev reflected holes persists in dn at a mesoscopic length scale and results in strong interference effects on the probability of andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable experimental manifestations of the coherent andreev reflection is the zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in dn / s junctions giazotto , klapwijk , kastalsky , nguyen , wees , nitta , bakker , xiong , magnee , kutch , poirier .",
    "the physics of zbcp was extensively studied theoretically using scattering matrix approach @xcite and the quasiclassical green s function technique volkov , nazarov1,yip , yip2,stoof , reentrance , golubov , takayanagi , bezuglyi , seviour , belzig .",
    "volkov , zaitsev and klapwijk ( vzk ) @xcite explained the origin of the zbcp in dn / s junctions in the framework of the quasiclassical theory by solving the usadel equations @xcite with the kupriyanov and lukichev ( kl ) boundary condition for the keldysh - nambu green s function @xcite . according to the vzk theory",
    "the zbcp is due to the enhancement of the pair amplitude in dn by the proximity effect .",
    "the influence of the magnetic impurity scattering on the bias voltage dependent conductance was also studied within this approach @xcite .",
    "recently the vzk theory for @xmath0-wave superconductors was extended by tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite using more general boundary conditions provided by the circuit theory of nazarov @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions treat an interface as an arbitrary connector between diffusive metals .",
    "the connector is characterized by a set of transmission coefficients ranging from a ballistic point contact to a tunnel junction .",
    "the boundary conditions coincide with the kl conditions when a connector is diffusive or transmission coefficients are low , while the btk theory @xcite is reproduced in the ballistic regime .",
    "the extended vzk theory @xcite revealed a number of new features like a @xmath5 -shaped gap like structure and a crossover from a zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) to a zero bias conductance dip ( zbcd ) .",
    "these phenomena are relevant for the actual junctions in which the barrier transparency is not necessarily small",
    ". however , the influence of the magnetic impurity scattering in dn on the charge transport was not studied in this regime .",
    "the generalized vzk theory was recently applied also to unconventional superconducting junctions @xcite .",
    "the formation of the midgap andreev resonant states ( mars ) at the interface of unconventional superconductors @xcite is naturally taken into account in this approach @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the formation of mars in dn/@xmath2-wave superconductor(dn/@xmath2 ) junctions strongly competes with the proximity effect .",
    "remarkable recent advances in experiments on tunneling in high @xmath6 cuprates @xcite stimulate an interest to the problem of an influence of the magnetic impurity scattering on a charge transport in dn/@xmath2 junctions .    in the present paper",
    "the generalized vzk theory is applied to the study of an influence of the magnetic impurity scattering in the dn on the conductance in dn / s where s is either @xmath0- or @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "the parameters of the problem are the height of the insulating barrier at the dn / s interface , the resistance @xmath7 , the magnetic impurity scattering rate @xmath8 , the thouless energy @xmath9 in dn and the angle @xmath10 between the normal to the interface and the crystal axis of @xmath2-wave superconductors .",
    "we shall focus on the dependence of the normalized conductance @xmath11 , on the bias voltage @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the conductances in the superconducting ( normal ) state .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section ii the detailed derivation of the expression for the normalized conductance is provided . in sections",
    "iii the results of calculations of @xmath14 are presented for @xmath0- and @xmath2-wave junctions separately and physical explanation of the results is given .",
    "in section iv the summary of the obtained results and the conclusions are presented . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low - temperature regime @xmath15 and put @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we introduce the model and the formalism . we consider a junction consisting of normal and superconducting reservoirs connected by a quasi - one - dimensional diffusive conductor ( dn ) with a length @xmath17 much larger than the mean free path .",
    "this structure was considered in ref .",
    "tgk , prb2004 , while in the present paper the scattering on magnetic impurities in dn is taken into account .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the interface between the dn conductor and the s electrode at @xmath18 has a resistance @xmath19 while the dn / n interface at @xmath20 has zero resistance and we apply the generalized boundary conditions of ref .",
    "nazarov2 to treat the interface between dn and s.    we model the insulating barrier between dn and s by the delta function @xmath21 , which provides the transparency of the junction @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath24 is the injection angle measured from the interface normal to the junction and @xmath25 is fermi velocity .",
    "the interface resistance @xmath19 is given by @xmath26where @xmath27 is sharvin resistance @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fermi wave - vector and @xmath30 is the constriction area ( see fig .",
    "note that the area @xmath30 is in general not equal to the cross - section area @xmath31 of the normal conductor , therefore @xmath32 is independent parameter of our theory .",
    "this allows to vary @xmath33 independently of @xmath34 . in real physical situation",
    ", the assumption @xmath35 means that only a part of the actual flat dn / s interface ( having area @xmath30 ) is conducting , no matter is it a single conducting region or a series of such regions .",
    "these conducting regions are not constrictions in a standard sense - we do nt assume the narrowing of the total cross - section , but rather that only the part of the cross - section is conducting .",
    "we apply the quasiclassical keldysh formalism in the following calculation of the conductance .",
    "the definitions of 4 @xmath36 4 green s functions in dn and s , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and other notations can be found in ref .",
    "the new feature in the present model is the spin - scattering term in the static usadel equation @xcite for @xmath37 in dn @xmath39+i[\\check{h}-i\\check{\\sigma}_{spin},\\check{g}_{1}(x)]=0,\\]]where @xmath40 is the diffusion constant in dn , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42with @xmath43 , and @xmath44is the self - energy for magnetic impurity scattering with the scattering rate @xmath45 in dn .",
    "note that magnetic impurities take random alignments and we average them in all directions , thus @xmath37 in our calculation is a unit matrix in the spin space .",
    "the nazarov s generalized boundary condition for @xmath46 at the dn / s interface has the same form as the one without magnetic impurity scattering ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the actual calculation",
    "it is convenient to use the standard @xmath47-parametrization where @xmath48 is a measure of the proximity effect in dn and is determined by the following equation @xmath49)\\sin [ \\theta ( x)]=0 ,   \\label{usa1}\\]]one can see that introduction of magnetic impurity scattering @xmath8 leads to modification of the effective coherence length in dn .",
    "in particular , switching on @xmath8 makes function @xmath48 exponentially decaying at zero energy , while @xmath48 at @xmath50 behaves linearly in dn .",
    "it will be shown below that these modifications result in suppression of @xmath51 in dn , as expected due to pair - breaking nature of magnetic scattering , which in turn leads to corresponding modifications of the subgap conductance .",
    "finally , we obtain the following result for the electric current @xmath52then the total resistance @xmath53 for @xmath0-wave junction at zero temperature is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 \\mid^{2 } } , \\ ] ] @xmath56 @xmath57 \\mathrm{imag}[\\cos \\theta_{l } \\sin\\theta_{l}^ { * } ] , \\ ] ]    @xmath58    @xmath59    for a @xmath2-wave junction , the function @xmath60 is given by the following expression @xmath61 \\mid^{2}}\\ ] ] @xmath62\\ ] ] @xmath63 \\}\\ ] ] @xmath64,\\ ] ]    @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the above @xmath3 , @xmath68 and @xmath69",

    "the conductance in the superconducting state @xmath72 is simply related to @xmath53 by @xmath73 .",
    "it is important to note that in the present approach , according to the circuit theory , @xmath74 can be varied independently of @xmath34 , @xmath75 , independently of @xmath76 , since one can change the magnitude of the constriction area @xmath77 independently .",
    "in other words , @xmath74 is no more proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the averaged transmissivity of the barrier and @xmath80 is the mean free path in the diffusive region .",
    "based on this fact , we can choose @xmath74 and @xmath76 as independent parameters .    in the following section",

    "<S> in contrast to that , in high transparent junctions zero - bias conductance is enhanced by magnetic impurity scattering . the physical origin of this effect is discussed . for the @xmath2-wave junctions , the dependence on the misorientation angle @xmath3 between the interface normal and the crystal axis of a superconductor is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - bias conductance peak is suppressed by the magnetic impurity scattering only for low transparent junctions with @xmath4 . in other cases </S>",
    "<S> the conductance of the @xmath2-wave junctions does not depend on the magnetic impurity scattering due to strong suppression of the proximity effect by the midgap andreev resonant states . </S>"
