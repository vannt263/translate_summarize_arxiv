    "two - particle correlations in momentum space can be used to extract information about the space - time structure of the emitting source @xcite .",
    "the method exploits in an essential way the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation between coordinates and momenta , and thus any formal treatment of two - particle correlations must be based on a quantum mechanical description . for so - called `` chaotic '' sources where",
    "the two particles are emitted independently the description can be based on the _ single - particle _ wigner density @xmath0 of the source .",
    "it is , however , known to be important ( at least in principle , but for sufficiently small sources also in practice ) that one starts from the correct quantum mechanical wigner density rather than directly from a classical space distribution @xmath1 of the particles in the source because the latter can lead to unphysical behavior of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "the correlations are `` generated '' after the emission by two classes of effects :    \\(1 ) for pairs of identical bosons ( fermions ) the two - particle wave function describing their propagation towards the detector must be symmetrized ( antisymmetrized ) . for boson pairs",
    "this results in quantum statistical `` bose - einstein correlations '' between the final state momenta of the two particles . via the uncertainty relation",
    "these momentum space correlations reflect the spatial and temporal structure of the source from which the two particles were emitted . this correspondence forms the basis for bose - einstein interferometry in nuclear and particle physics @xcite , a variant of the well - known hanbury brown ",
    "twiss intensity interferometry in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for both pairs of identical and non - identical particles additional two - particle correlations can be generated by two - particle final state interactions , notably by the long - range coulomb interaction if the particles carry charge @xcite .",
    "these final state effects also depend on the spatial and temporal distance between the emission points of the two particles and thus must contain information about the space - time structure of the source . while in the last few years we have seen considerable progress in our understanding of how to extract from two - particle correlations quantitative information on both the geometric and the dynamic space - time structure ( sizes , lifetime and expansion velocities ) of the source _ in the absence of final state interactions ( fsi ) _",
    "@xcite , not much is known about how to _ quantitatively _ correct these methods for fsi effects .",
    "this is largely due to the lack of a general and exact expression which relates the measured correlation function to the emission function of the source . in the absence of fsi ( and for chaotic source ) this relation reads @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the single particle wigner density ( `` emission function '' ) of the source , and where @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the second term in ( [ 1 ] ) reflects the quantum statistical correlations .",
    "this expression allows to expand the correlation function @xmath5 in space - time moments of the emission function @xcite and relate the main characteristics of the two - particle correlator , its width as a function of the relative momentum @xmath6 , to the second central space - time moment ( `` r.m.s .",
    "widths '' ) of the emission function in coordinate space .",
    "the factor @xmath7 in the correlation term in ( [ 1 ] ) reflects the assumed absence of fsi , i.e. plane wave propagation .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to generalize relation ( [ 1 ] ) to the case including two - particle fsi .",
    "existing treatments of this problem @xcite differ in their results even on the formal level because different types of approximations are used already in intermediate stages of the calculation .",
    "this , unfortunately , makes a direct comparison of these results and a check of the approximations essentially impossible .",
    "our aim is to give a rigorous derivation of the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , using only the following two approximations :    \\(1 ) the source is completely chaotic , i.e. the particles are emitted independently , and    \\(2 ) finite multiplicity corrections @xcite can be neglected .",
    "both approximations are expected to be good for high energy nuclear collisions with large multiplicities , but may require further scrutiny in lower multiplicity @xmath8 or hadron - hadron collisions . on the other hand , high multiplicities can result in modifications ( screening ) of the two - particle ( coulomb ) potential due to the influence of the environment of other charged particles .",
    "it was , however , shown in @xcite that such screening effects are small and can be neglected because the charge density of the environment drops rapidly as a function of the distance from the collision center ( faster than @xmath9 ) and the pair leaves very quickly the region of high charge density .",
    "the two - particle correlation function @xmath10 is defined as a ratio between the normalized invariant two - particle coincidence cross section @xmath11 and the product of the invariant single particle cross sections @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "most space will be taken by the calculation of the two - particle emission probability @xmath11 .",
    "its normalization by the product of single particle probabilities is a trivial final step .",
    "our strategy is as follows : we start by writing down an expression for the two - particle probability amplitude @xmath16 for measuring at @xmath17 in the detector a pair of particles with momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 if the pair has been emitted by the source in a two - particle state @xmath20 .",
    "the square of this amplitude , averaged properly over the distribution of two - particle quantum numbers @xmath21 in the source by taking the trace with an appropriate density matrix for the source , will give the two - particle probability @xmath22 .",
    "this amplitude , first written down in terms of an overlap integral at @xmath17 with an asymptotic two - particle momentum eigenstate in the detector , is then rewritten in terms of a corresponding overlap integral in the source at the time of freeze - out , by using the time evolution operator ( including the two - particle fsi ) to evolve the asymptotic state backwards in time .    here",
    "a crucial ingredient will be the realization that the two - particle fsi can only act while both particles are present .",
    "if one is emitted earlier than the other , in the absence of one - body final state interactions with the remainder of the source ( e.g. between its charge and that of the remaining fireball which we will here neglect ) it will undergo _ free _ time evolution until the second particle has also been formed . to implement this requires the factorization of the two - particle wave function into a product of single - particle states , i.e. the assumption of independent emission .",
    "this interval of free propagation gives rise to an additional phase which contains the time structure of the source and which may be important for attempts to extract source lifetimes from the two - particle correlator .",
    "as far as we know , this aspect has not been fully discussed in previous fsi studies @xcite .    once the two - particle amplitude @xmath16 is expressed in terms of an overlap integral at the time of particle freeze - out",
    ", one can calculate the two - particle probability by averaging over the quantum numbers @xmath21 and the distribution of emission times . due to the assumed factorization of the two - particle wave function",
    "the result can be expressed in terms of the single particle wigner density of the source at freeze - out @xmath0 which will be defined in eq .",
    "( [ 42 ] ) .",
    "the remainder of the derivation consists of an appropriate rewriting of this expression which allows to compare it with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and which can serve as a starting point for further approximations in order to compare with previously published expressions in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we should stress that our derivation is intrinsically non - relativistic . for this to be appropriate",
    "we must work in a reference frame in which the pair moves non - relativistically , i.e. where @xmath23 . since we are interested in the deviation of the correlator @xmath5 from unity for small @xmath6 , the relative motion is then also non - relativistic . in this frame",
    "the two - particle fsi can be represented by an instantaneous potential , and the difference between the emission times of the two particles is well - defined .",
    "the final result can then be evaluated in an arbitrary frame by proper lorentz transformation of all momenta . a completely covariant derivation ( which should also be possible by introducing propagating fields for the fsi )",
    "has not yet been achieved .",
