    "the telescope made by meade , a world leader in manufacturing of amateur telescopes .",
    "its primary mirror diameter is 50@xmath0 , and the focal ratio is f8 .",
    "a well sited 50@xmath0 telescope could reach the 19 magnitude with a deep sky imager(dsi ) by 1 minute .",
    "the main instruments include a 4k@xmath14k optical camera , and a 640@xmath1512 near infrared camera .",
    "the stx-16803 optical camera is made by sbig .",
    "the camera has a full frame image buffer for storing image data during download .",
    "the xeva - fpa-1.7 - 640 infrared camera is one of the revolution in short wave ir cameras , working up to 1.7@xmath2 .",
    "the candidate site selected is called ali , tibet(fig1 ) , located at n32@xmath419@xmath5 , e80@xmath401@xmath5 , with altitude of 5100@xmath3@xcite .",
    "remote study with the long - term database of ground weather stations and archival satellite data has been performed@xcite .",
    "the site has enough relative height on the plateau and is accessible by car .",
    "the robotic telescopes are complex systems(fig2 ) that combine a lot of subsystems .",
    "these subsystems serve to provide telescope pointing capability , control of telescope dome , as well as detection of weather conditions .",
    "we are building a 6@xmath3 dome for the infrared telescope .",
    "we have already installed satellite antenna in beijing and ali for remote observations .",
    "the solar power system is also equipped , and the introduction of high voltage power on the site is possible .",
    "* 3.1 site testing : * the telescope will be able to evaluate ali site of sky quality , atmospheric extinction , etc . it can also get the characterizaiton of the astronomical seeing conditions@xcite . + * 3.2 experiment of high resolution target observations : * fig3 is an image of the international space station , taken by a 20@xmath0 telescope in beijing .",
    "we hope to make further research of image recovery with the 50@xmath0 telescope on the excellent site .",
    "fig3.1 is the original image from camera ; fig3.2 is processed using photoshop ; fig3.3 is the restoring object images from the noisy turbulence degraded image of fig3.1 . ]",
    "+ * 3.3 search for extrasolar planets : * we will use photometric method to search for extrasolar planets , and we will also develop some new methods to detect the atmospheric compositions of an extrasolar planet . + * 3.4 detection of variable stars : * our goal is to detect variable stars and classify these stars in an online catalog in order to approach the origins of variations .",
