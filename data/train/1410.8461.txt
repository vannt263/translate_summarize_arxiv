    "weak - value amplification is a metrological technique intended to precisely measure small parameters , such as optical beam deflections  @xcite , phase shifts  @xcite , frequency shifts  @xcite , velocities  @xcite , and temperature  @xcite .",
    "a weak - value technique was shown by viza _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to saturate the cramr - rao bound for small velocity measurements .",
    "quantum mechanically , it consists of a weak interaction of a system with a meter , separated in time by nearly orthogonal pre- and post - selection measurements on a system  @xcite . in this technique",
    ", the parameter of interest controls the weakness of the interaction . as such ,",
    "a small shift in the value of the parameter corresponds to a large shift in the meter .",
    "a well - designed weak - values experiment concentrates almost all available information about the parameter of interest into the small fraction of events that survive the post - selection process  @xcite , except for a negligibly small amount that can in principle be extracted from the non - post - selected events .",
    "existing experiments of this kind also have a wave optics interpretation so long as we focus on intensities and not photon counts  @xcite .    in previous works , hosten and kwiat measured an angstrom beam shift to detect the spin hall effect of light  @xcite .",
    "subsequent experiments demonstrated the ability to measure down to @xmath2 frad of deflection  @xcite , and also showed gains in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )  @xcite .",
    "weak - value amplification has also been shown to improve the snr relative to the non - post - selected case in the presence of additive correlated technical noise by the steinberg group in ref .",
    "the question of quantifying the relative advantages of weak value metrology techniques has taken on a renewed importance .",
    "several recent theoretical papers claimed that weak - value amplification shows no advantages in comparison with techniques that use all the photons when optimal statistical estimators are used  @xcite . when considering ideal , quantum - limited experiments and detectors this",
    "was shown a number of years ago by the authors in ref .",
    "however , in the presence of certain kinds of technical noise sources , assuming statistically independent photons , we have claimed theoretically in a recent paper  @xcite that when using _ optimal _ statistical estimators that saturate the cramr - rao bound , the weak - value amplification method can give advantages in the estimation of a parameter compared to other methods .",
    "that paper gave several predictions in this regard .",
    "since these kinds of technical noise sources plague every kind of metrological experiment , a way of approaching the fundamental quantum limits in their presence is of great interest .",
    "there have been numerous papers claiming advantages for weak - value - based metrology ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , including a series of very recent works  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present data to quantify the advantages weak - value - based experiments offer for optical beam deflection measurements .",
    "weak values , unlike eigenvalues , can be complex . in this work we focus on imaginary - weak - value experiments , which previous studies have shown to perform better than real weak values for metrology in some circumstances  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary weak value corresponds to a shift in one variable resulting in the displacement of its conjugate . in our experiment",
    ", this indicates that a momentum shift results in a transverse beam displacement .",
    "similarly , in the standard technique , after the momentum kick a focusing lens effects a fourier transform on the beam which results in a transverse beam displacement . in making the comparison between the weak - value - based technique ( wvt ) and the standard technique ( st )",
    ", we pay special attention to the statistical estimators used . for the st",
    ", we use an estimator which can achieve the lowest possible variance for unbiased estimators .",
    "we make a detailed study of the efficiency of the wvt statistical estimator . figure  [ fig : setup ] contains diagrams of the experiments carried out .",
    "we begin with a sagnac interferometer to measure a beam deflection as in  @xcite and add two external modulating sources , meant to simulate noise sources at a given frequency : a transverse momentum modulation , @xmath3 , and a transverse detector modulation , @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "we define a measure of sensitivity of the experiment to these modulations to be the ratio , @xmath5 , of the signal to the external modulation amplitudes . using single - frequency external modulations ,",
    "we show that the wvt performs as well as or better than the st and the amount of advantage is governed by the geometry and choice of parameters of the experiment .",
    "( sd@xmath6 ) .",
    "the wvt uses a sagnac interferometer , and the st focuses the deflected beam with focal length @xmath7 .",
    "the piezo @xmath8:@xmath8 beam splitter imparts a momentum kick @xmath9 , which we determine from the beam shift on split detector @xmath6 .",
    "the two external modulations are labeled as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 refers to the transverse detector modulation and @xmath3 refers to the transverse momentum modulation .",
    "polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) are in orange and @xmath8:@xmath8 beam splitter are in blue .",
    "the pbs work as mirrors given that the light is vertically polarized . the split detector @xmath10 ( sd@xmath10 ) is used to collect the bright port beam shift from the wvt .",
    "]    in what follows , we show modulations and noise sources outside the interferometer of the wvt are un - amplified and thus suppressed compared to the signal , while the st responds similarly to all modulations and noise sources . in the experiments we perform ,",
    "all modulating sources are independent of the parameter of interest .",
    "this holds true even for naturally occurring laser - beam - jitter noise . in demonstrating these effects , we report the following results .",
    "( i ) the ratio @xmath5 of the wvt indicates that the transverse momentum , @xmath3 , and transverse detection , @xmath4 , modulations are suppressed over st .",
    "( ii ) comparing the deviation in measurements of transverse momentum @xmath9 to the smallest predicted error , the wvt offers improvement for both transverse momentum and transverse detection modulations over the st .",
    "( iii ) we show there is practically no fisher information lost to the bright port of the wvt .",
    "lastly , the wvt suppresses _ naturally _ occurring laser - beam - jitter noise over the st . for all our results ,",

    "this assumes @xmath172 ( controlling the weakness of the interaction ) is suitably reduced as well , while also measuring a sufficiently large number of photons .",
    "amazingly , eq .  ( [ eq : result ] ) indicates that the technique is _ more _ efficient the _ fewer _ photons measured in the dark port . since @xmath169 can be made small , we conclude the technique can be made as efficient as desired in principle .",
    "the important practical limitation is the fidelity of the optics , getting a good dark port , and any other deviations from the theory .    in the paper by jordan _",
    "et al_.  @xcite the theoretical predictions are in the classical fisher information but the result is the same as quantum fisher information .",
    "both techniques are near shot - noise limited , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : externalmod ] ) , and the techniques are assumed to reach their respective cramr - rao bound  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fisherinfo ] gives strong evidence that the wvt will perform the same if we send individual photons through the experiment . from a metrological perspective",
    "the precision of @xmath40 independent measurements is recovered from only a fraction of measurements .",
    "even from the classical perspective as we throw away @xmath1 of the intensity in the wvt we recover the precision associated with using all the available measurements as in the st .",
    "thus the wvt in a sense squeezes _ all _ the available fisher information to the few surviving postselected photons .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : allextmod ] , the amplitude of the angular modulation outside the interferometer is suppressed in the wvt , relative to the st .",
    "this behavior was predicted theoretically to occur , regardless of the frequency of the oscillation @xcite .",
    "we will now see how this effect can be put to use for a more general noise in the wild . to accomplish this , we removed the connecting fiber that stabilizes the laser , and direct the light into one of the two experiments in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the signal on the detector then registers noise that is a combination of electronic noise and intrinsic laser jitter .",
    "we note that the statistics of this jitter is neither white , nor gaussian , nor is it stationary .",
    "the angular jitter originates from the physics of the laser , and exists up to around @xmath173 hz in this experiment .",
    "it has strong frequency components at around @xmath8 and @xmath91 hz .",
    "its constantly changing statistical nature makes any kind of improved statistical estimation strategy extremely challenging .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the weak - value experiment globally suppresses the amplitude of all angular jitter from outside the interferometer makes the wvt very convenient as a noise reduction strategy .",
    "indeed , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : beamjitterfreq ] that the contribution of the laser jitter to the noise spectrum is essentially eliminated entirely , being reduced below the electronic noise floor .",
    "is the signal from the detector in volts . without the fiber , the beam is shaped to @xmath174 mm and is sent to the experiments .",
    "the beam jitter is found in the low frequency regime ( under @xmath6 khz ) .",
    "we see about @xmath52 dbv improvement in the wvt for low frequencies ( under @xmath173 hz ) .",
    "we note similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : allextmod ] , the comparison is not of beam shift , but of voltages from the laser - beam - jitter noise .",
    "both data sets were taken by averaging 128 samples .",
    "the plots are normalized to the detected power , @xmath53 ( either the wvt or the st in their respective experiments ) .",
    "note that this is a voltage comparison and not a deflection comparison of wvt and the st . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamjitterfreq ] , the fourier transform of both the wvt ( blue ) and the st ( green ) signal as a function of frequency is given .",
    "the fourier transforms shown are the average of @xmath175 samples and the wvt postselection angle is @xmath176 rad .",
    "we note , while the st uses @xmath2 @xmath58w and the wvt uses @xmath177 mw of power , the fourier transform of the signals of both are renormalized given the total detected power used in each technique for a fair comparison .",
    "next , we made the measurements in the time domain with a sample time of @xmath178 ms and compared the relative error of @xmath9 in both techniques .",
    "the relative error is the deviation of the measurements of @xmath9 , @xmath92 , divided by its respective lower bound , @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kcrb ] ) .",
    "the relative error of the st is @xmath179 and the wvt is @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , wvt suppresses intrinsic beam - jitter noise at best @xmath78 times over the st .",
    "most importantly from fig .",
    "[ fig : beamjitterfreq ] , the wvt completely suppresses this laser - beam - jitter noise , showing only electronic noise from the detector .",
    "we independently verified the intrinsic laser beam jitter to be about @xmath180 @xmath58rad peak to peak using the full width at half maximum and twice the deviation of the data collected from fig .",
    "[ fig : beamjitterfreq ] .",
    "the wvt has a total propagation length of @xmath181 cm from the laser to detector .",
    "the st used a focal length of @xmath6 m. we can verify the claim that the wvt globally suppresses laser - beam - jitter noise by comparing the suppression of the intrinsic ( stochastic ) beam jitter to the single frequency modulation at an amplitude chosen to be the typical wander . from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : externalmod](b ) where one single frequency is modulating an external mirror before the interferometer ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : beamjitterfreq ] , the suppression factor for the intrinsic beam jitter is at best @xmath78 and the suppression for the single - frequency tone from fig .",
    "[ fig : externalmod]b is @xmath182 ( at @xmath180 @xmath58rad peak to peak ) , giving comparable results .",
    "this paper has been focused on two major issues .",
    "the first is a comparison of two experimental techniques , st and wvt .",
    "the st is a standard angle deflection technique off of a tilted mirror , while the wvt includes a beam splitter , making the system an interferometer that may be interpreted as a realization of the aharonov , albert , vaidman , weak - value amplification effect if one output port is monitored @xcite . in the absence of any technical limitations , it is important to stress that both systems give the same fundamental limitation [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fisherwv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : stfisher ] ) ] on the measurement uncertainly of the mirror tilt , given the same number of input photons .",
    "therefore , the  weak - value amplification \" alone gives no metrological advantage , unless it is combined with the other effects we have identified .",
    "we have noted this point some time ago @xcite , though some authors have recently rediscovered it @xcite and included the study of pixelation and uncorrelated transverse jitter  @xcite .",
    "however , under realistic conditions such as a detector that saturates ( responds nonlinearly ) , the presence of vibrational detector noise or the presence of angular jitter , we have shown the wvt can perform orders of magnitude better than the st .",
    "this is consistent with independent investigations using variations of this experiment , claiming record precision  @xcite .",
    "we have reported experimental results quantifying this effect under the presence of transverse detector modulations and transverse momentum modulations .",
    "the second major issue considered in this paper is an analysis of how well a given experimental technique  the weak - value - based experiment  uses the available information contained in the data .",
    "this checks just how efficient the weak - value - based technique is , in light of criticisms that neglecting other information sources by the postselection makes the metrological technique inefficient @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally that by measuring only @xmath0 of the light in the experiment , @xmath1 of the theoretically available information may be extracted from it , as we have theoretically predicted @xcite . in principle , the remaining @xmath0 of the information can be extracted from the bright port . however , the corresponding signal deamplification makes the problem one of finding a small signal in a bright background technically difficult .",
    "we have also shown how the efficiency can be further boosted by measuring a _ smaller _ fraction of the photons if desired , and consequently a well - designed weak - value - based metrology experiment is remarkably efficient . in a sense",
    ", the wvt can be viewed as a filtering procedure where the selected photons carry the vast majority of the fisher information , and the noninformative photons have been filtered out .    when combined with other ideas of signal recycling  @xcite and power recycling @xcite , or quantum enhancements  @xcite ,",
    "we anticipate future weak - value - based metrological experiments will be able to reach even greater levels of precision .",
