    "it has long been recognised that the ultimate accuracy of optical measurements is set by the quantum nature of light . indeed",
    "the desire to approach these quantum limits was a strong motivation for the study of nonclassical and particularly squeezed states of light @xcite .",
    "the use of coherent laser sources typically provides a limiting resolution that is inversely proportional to the square root of the mean number of photons used in the measurement ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this can be improved upon by the use of squeezed states which enhances the resolution by the square root of the degree of squeezing ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the full quantum limit is reached by complete control of the photon number and gives a quantum limited resolution that it inversely proportional to the photon number ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest proposals for the application of squeezed light was to improve the sensitivity of optical interferometry @xcite , which was demonstrated very soon after the first successful squeezing experiments @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a demonstration of enhanced sensitivity in a spectroscopic measurement @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that squeezed light can be used to enhance the resolution of measurements of small displacements in optical images , or beam displacements @xcite .",
    "an experimental demonstration , based on squeezed light prepared in a novel ` flipped ' mode , followed soon afterwards @xcite .",
    "the quantum limit for detection of phase shifts can be approached using a balanced interferometer with equal intensity inputs @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the same degree of resolution could be achieved by means of special beam - splitters that send all of the light though one arm of the interferometer so that a two - mode ` schrdinger - cat ' state is prepared @xcite .",
    "the same @xmath2-limited resolution can be obtained for beam displacements by use of a pair of specially shaped modes , each having precisely the same number of photons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the factors limiting our ability to measure the rotation of a beam about the optical axis .",
    "we will find that , as with interferometric and beam - displacement measurements , the resolution depends on the number of photons used and can be improved by the use of suitable nonclassical states of light .",
    "the resolution also depends , however , on the orbital angular momentum of the light used to make the observation @xcite",
    ". we will find that it is the product of the orbital angular momentum per photon , @xmath3 , and the total photon number , @xmath4 , that determines the limiting resolution .",
    "hence it is the total number of quanta of orbital angular momentum , @xmath5 , that sets the minimum detectable rotation .",
    "after some general considerations , sect .",
    "[ sect:2 ] , we present two different schemes to measure small rotations , sect .",

    "let us consider a light beam propagating through an _ image rotator _ , that is a device that rotates an input image about the optical axis .",
    "it is not necessary to specify the form of the rotator , but elementary examples include a rotating dove prism @xcite , or a pair of stationary dove prisms with a fixed relative orientation .",
    "the latter arrangement has recently been used to detect optical angular momentum at the single - photon level @xcite .",
    "a further example of a beam rotator is a light beam passing _ off - axis _ through a rotating glass disc , which induces a tangential displacement , or rotation , of the beam @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a beam with an image , or transverse spatial profile , @xmath6 propagating in the @xmath7 direction through an image rotator .",
    "the beam after passing through the rotator has a transverse profile @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the azimuthal rotation angle and we fix the @xmath7 axis as the rotation axis . in sect .",
    "[ sect:3 ] and [ sect:4 ] we will consider two different beams @xmath10 .",
    "it is natural to describe the beam @xmath10 as superposition of laguerre - gaussian modes as these are eigenmodes of the @xmath11component of angular momentum , which is the generator of the rotation .",
    "this means that the only effect of a rotator on these modes is to add a constant phase shift .",
    "laguerre - gaussian modes , which at the beam waist have the form @xcite : @xmath12 \\left(\\frac{r}{w_0}\\right)^{|\\ell |}l_p^{|\\ell |}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{w_0 ^ 2}\\right ) e^{i\\ell \\phi},\\ ] ] are labelled by an angular index , @xmath13 , associated with the angular momentum carried by the beam @xcite , and by a radial index , @xmath14 , giving @xmath15 bright rings in the intensity profile ( fig .",

    "we observe a spreading in the intensity , as shown in c ) @xmath25 and d ) @xmath26.,width=302 ]    our study of rotation measurements starts with the realization that the optics used will , inevitably , have a maximum distance from the optical axis beyond which light will be lost by the experiment . for simplicity , we suppose that this limit is set by the radius @xmath27 of the rotator .",
    "this , in turn , sets a maximum value for the angular momentum that can be carried by a mode propagating through it @xcite .",
    "the laguerre - gaussian modes with non - zero @xmath14 extend to a larger radius than those with the same value of @xmath13 but @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this means that the largest allowed angular momentum will occur for a @xmath16 mode .",
    "for a mode with a bright ring of radius ( [ eq : r.max ] ) at the edges of the device ( @xmath28 ) , the beam would be strongly diffracted .",
    "the radial intensity distribution of the laguerre - gaussian modes , for large values of @xmath29 , has the form @xmath30 so that the intensity tends to be radially distributed like a gaussian centred in @xmath31 and with a waist @xmath32 .",
    "hence we can set the limit for a transmitted laguerre - gaussian mode for @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : r.max ] ) we obtain the maximum angular momentum index transmitted by a device with maximum effective radius @xmath27 as : @xmath34    we can use this result to suggest a probable limit for the smallest detectable rotation @xmath35 . consider the uncertainty relation for rotation angle and angular momentum @xcite @xmath36 where the values of @xmath37 are in the range @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the form of this uncertainty relation has recently been confirmed experimentally @xcite , and states minimizing the uncertainty product ( [ eq : uncert ] ) have been derived @xcite . for small angular uncertainties we have @xmath39 which gives a bound on the minimum possible @xmath40 : @xmath41 for the analogous problem of the optical phase @xcite the minimum achievable uncertainty is inversely proportional to the mean ( or maximum ) photon number ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the minimum resolvable phase shift also seems to be inversely proportional to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the minimum resolvable rotation given a single photon will be @xmath42 we expect that the optimal use of @xmath4 photons will give a limit @xmath43 the analogy between the uncertainty , @xmath40 , and the resolution , @xmath35 , leads us to refer to ( [ eq : prec2 ] ) as the ` heisenberg ' limit .",
    "a natural way to measure small angles imparted by an image rotator is through the displacement of a beam shining the rotator far from the axis , as in jones experiment @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the azimuthal displacement gives the measure of the rotation angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "clearly the resolution is increased by working at the edges of the device , that is at the maximum distance from the device axis , and with a small size of the light spot . in the following we consider a beam with a gaussian transverse profile , centred in @xmath44 @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a small beam waist @xmath32 and large @xmath46 , ` near ' to the edge of the device .",
    "clearly there are limits for the achievable experimental precision due simply to the finite size of the optical elements used . given a device with a radial size @xmath27 , than the off - axis gaussian ( [ eq : gauss.in ] ) will be transmitted if @xmath47 .    the rotated output beam obtained by eqs .",

    "we find @xmath50 so that the resolution achieved measuring small angles in this scheme depends on the lateral beam position @xmath46 and on the precise measurement of the displacement @xmath51 between the input and the rotated light spots .",
    "small displacements @xmath51 are measured with high resolution by shining a split detector and taking the difference of the light intensities on the two halves @xcite . for a perfectly aligned beam",
    "the signal detected is zero , while any small misalignment gives an imbalance in the intensities .",
    "given a gaussian mode in a coherent state with mean photon number equal to @xmath4 , the minimum displacement measurable is @xmath52 the standard quantum limit ( [ eq:1coh ] ) can be beaten by engineering the spatial mode impinging on the detector and its statistics .",
    "in particular the input beam is prepared by superposing an even gaussian mode ( [ eq : gauss.in ] ) with an odd @xmath53 mode @xmath54 .",
    "we note that a flipped mode is not stable under propagation as it has a discontinuity in @xmath55 that would be smoothed by diffraction . nevertheless , it was experimentally possible to beat the shot noise limit in displacement measurements by shaping this kind of beam @xcite .",
    "in general we have @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 depending on the state in which the modes @xmath58 and @xmath10 are prepared .",
    "if the gaussian mode is in a coherent state with average intensity @xmath4 and the flipped mode is in vacuum then @xmath59 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1coh ] ) .",
    "this is the limit resolution obtained with classical states , i.e. the standard quantum limit .",
    "better resolution can be achieved if the flipped mode is prepared in a strongly squeezed state , leading to @xmath60 .",
    "the best resolution is obtained with highly non - classical states , for instance by preparing the two modes in number states @xmath61 . in this case @xmath62 and the displacement @xmath63 is the ` heisenberg limit ' mentioned in the previous section .    from these results for displacement measurements",

    "we can see this either by writing @xmath6 in terms of its angular fourier components @xcite @xmath66 or by explicitly constructing its decomposition in terms of the laguerre - gaussian modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histo - gauss]b ) .",
    "the latter procedure is carried out in the appendix . due to the dispersion in the angular momentum spectrum ,",

    ", we are interested in the smallest angles @xmath35 that can be measured with this device .",
    "the rotation through an angle @xmath35 on the beam ( [ eq : ameigen.in ] ) introduces only a homogeneous phase shift @xmath83 on the whole beam , and so it follows that the description of the interferometer in fig .",

    "the angle resolution is then @xmath92 which is the ` heisenberg limit ' anticipated in section [ sect:2 ] .",

    "in particular , use of correlated number states can produce a resolution that is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "we can also increase the sensitivity by changing the functional dependence on @xmath94 . using eigenmodes of orbital angular momentum",
    "leads to a resolution proportional to @xmath96 , with the ultimate ` heisenberg ' limit being @xmath97 .    we have demonstrated a clear analogy between orbital angular momentum in rotation measurements and photon number in interferometry .",
    "there are , however , very important practical differences .",
    "creating states of well defined orbital angular momentum is relatively straightforward , while making photon number states is very difficult .",
    "secondly , enhancement of resolution based on controlling the photon number requires extremely high efficiencies of photon detection as any losses rapidly degrade the signal by changing the expected photon number .",
