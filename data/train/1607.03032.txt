    "the charge drift mobility , depending on electric field , temperature , lattice and field orientation , is a critical parameter in the understanding of the rise time of charge pulses , which are often used to determine the sequence of gamma interactions inside a germanium detector , and to find the origin of gamma tracks for gamma - tracking experiments such as agata  @xcite and gretina  @xcite . in the germanium - based neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments , such as gerda  @xcite and majorana  @xcite",
    ", the charge drift mobility plays a critical role in measuring the charge pulse shape  @xcite that distinguishes background events ( the multiple - site events from compton scattering ) from signal events ( the single - site events from two electrons of neutrinoless double - beta decay process ) .",
    "the digital pulse shape is determined using the rise time of the charge pulse induced by the energy deposition in a given germanium detector .",
    "the rise time is proportional to the charge drift velocity , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the charge drift mobility and @xmath2 is electric field . to ensure that the detector performance of the digital pulse shapes is well understood",
    ", it is essential to simulate the digital pulse shapes to compare with the measured ones . in the monte carlo simulation",
    ", the electric field distribution can be accurately calculated using poisson equation for an applied voltage and a given geometry of the detector , while the charge drift mobility is often treated as a constant .",
    "this can be true only if the charge drift mobility at 77 kelvin is solely constrained by the lattice scattering , which is a constant at low fields , and for the @xmath3100@xmath4 axis for a given temperature .",
    "however , the charge drift mobility is usually governed by several scattering mechanisms including ionized impurity scattering , neutral impurity scattering , lattice scattering , and others .",
    "it is well known that the charge drift mobility can be impacted by temperature , crystal orientation , impurity concentration , defect concentration , and also electron and hole concentration  @xcite . among them , the scattering mechanisms play a very important role in determining the total charge drift mobility for a given crystal orientation .",
    "traditionally , the lattice scattering and the ionized impurity scattering are used to determine the total charge drift mobility in the monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "the neutral impurity scattering has not been considered to be an important contribution to the total charge drift mobility at 77 kelvin and has been reported in some literature as having no direct impact on the electrical properties of germanium crystals  @xcite . in 1994 ,",

    "similar to other electrically active impurities , the neutral impurities can also act as scattering centers to impede the drift and diffusion of charge carriers under an electric field . as a result",
    ", the charge drift mobility is expected to decrease as the neutral impurities concentration increases  @xcite . to demonstrate the variation of the charge drift mobility as a function of the concentration of neutral impurities , one must separate the portion of the charge drift mobility contributed by the ionized impurity scattering , lattice scattering , and other scatterings .",
    "this requires a comprehensive study of the contributions to the charge drift mobility due to the ionized impurity scattering , lattice scattering , and neutral impurity scattering , and others . in this work ,",
    "the calculation of the charge drift mobility due to different scattering processes , and the impact of neutral impurity concentrations on the charge drift mobility are presented in section  [ s : mobi ] , followed by the experimental results in section  [ s : exp ] .",

    "the charge drift mobility of germanium detectors depends on the rate at which charge carriers are scattered by impurity atoms and defects in the crystalline structure .",
    "the rate is the reciprocal of the relaxation time , which is the average time between collisions , and will be discussed later in terms of each scattering mechanism .",
    "the relationship between the relaxation time and the charge drift mobility is given by  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the charge drift mobility , @xmath6 is the relaxation time , @xmath7 is the elementary charge and @xmath8 is the effective mass of the charge carrier .",
    "the total charge drift mobility of a charge carrier has contributions from at least five main scattering processes in a germanium detector : ionized impurity scattering , neutral impurity scattering , acoustic phonon scattering , optical phonon scattering and dislocation scattering  @xcite .",
    "note that acoustical phonon scattering and optical phonon scattering belong to lattice scattering .",
    "the total charge drift mobility is impacted independently by the scattering mechanisms mentioned above and can be determined by using matthiessen s rule  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total charge drift mobility , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mobilities contributed by the scattering of ionized impurities , neutral impurities , acoustic phonons , optical phonons and dislocation , respectively .    as indicated by eq .",

    "furthermore , the neutral impurity concentration , @xmath16 , can be estimated if the relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath12 can be established .",
    "ionized impurity scattering occurs when a charge carrier deviates from its trajectory by a coulomb interaction as it gets close to an ionized impurity atom  @xcite .",

    "the scattering of charge carriers by acoustical phonons is believed to be a very important contribution to the total charge drift mobility in semiconductors  @xcite .",

    "<S> we report a new result of the neutral impurity scattering of electrons and holes that has impact on the charge drift mobility in high purity germanium crystals at 77 kelvin . </S>",
    "<S> the charge carrier concentration , mobility and resistivity are measured by hall effect system at 77 kelvin . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the contribution to the total charge drift mobility from ionized impurity scattering , lattice scattering , and neutral impurity scattering with the best theoretical models and experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> several samples with measured hall mobility from the grown crystals are used for this investigation . with the measured hall mobility and ionized impurity concentration as well as the theoretical models </S>",
    "<S> , we calculated the neutral impurity concentration by the matthiessen s rule . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the distributions of the neutral impurity concentrations with respect to the radius of the crystals are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we demonstrate that neutral impurity scattering is a significant contribution to the charge drift mobility , which has dependence on the concentration of neutral impurities in a given germanium crystal . </S>"
