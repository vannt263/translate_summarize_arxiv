    "synchronization in a network of connected elements is essential to the proper functioning of a wide variety of natural and engineered systems , from brain networks to electric power grids .",
    "this has stimulated a large number of investigations into synchronization properties of complex networks , with small - world , scale - free and other types of topologies  @xcite . yet",
    "many synchronization phenomena , as in electrical power grids , do not involve a single network in isolation but rely on the global synchronization of a collection of smaller networks . and",
    "more generally , beyond single networks , we are now understanding that interactions between networks are increasingly important and that interactions can impact the dynamical processes  @xcite .",
    "one paradigm that captures many real - world interdependent networks is that of multiplex networks . here",
    "the same set of nodes interact on different layers , where each layer represents a different edge type , the state of the node on each layer can be distinct , and the connectivity pattern on each layer can be unique  @xcite . as an example consider the online social system of a set of individuals .",
    "they may interact on twitter or on facebook or on linked - in or on some combination of all three , and each layer can have its own connectivity pattern , yet there is typically influence propagated between the layers .",
    "given the need to study dynamical processes on layered complex networks , and the broad applicability of synchronization , here we study synchronization phenomena on multiplex networks , an area that has attracted increasing attention in the past few years @xcite .",
    "one of the most important methods to study network synchronization on isolated networks is the master stability function ( msf ) method proposed by pecora and carroll @xcite .",
    "as established via the msf approach , whether or not a network can achieve synchronization is determined not only by the network structure , but also by the nodal dynamics and the inner coupling function which describes the interactions among the different components of the state vectors of connected nodes @xcite .",
    "current studies of synchronization phenomena in multiplex networks analyze a multiplex network as a single large composite network with the topology being described by a supra - laplacian matrix .",
    "this requires that the inner coupling function is the same regardless of whether the nodes are linked by an intra - layer or inter - layer edge and the msf framework can thus be directly applied .",
    "the eigenvalues of this supra - laplacian are then used to analyze the stability of the synchronous state in multiplex networks .",
    "for example , sol - ribalta et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the spectral properties of the laplacian of multiplex networks , and discussed the synchronizability via the eigenratio of the laplacian matrix .",
    "aguirre et al .",
    "@xcite studied the impact of the connector node degree on the synchronizability of two star networks with one inter - layer link and showed that connecting the high - degree ( low - degree ) nodes of each network is the most ( least ) effective strategy to achieve synchronization .",
    "@xcite investigated the synchronizability of two - layer networks for three specific coupling patterns , and determined that there exists an optimal value of the inter - layer coupling strength for maximizing synchronizability of the two - layer networks they analyze .",
    "@xcite investigated the sychronizability of a duplex network composed of two star networks with two inter - layer links by giving an analytical expression containing the largest and the smallest nonzero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix , the link weight , as well as the network size . in 2012 , sorrentino et al .",
    "@xcite considered an innovative  hypernetwork \" model consisting of nodes that interact via multiple types of coupling functions .",
    "they were interested in the stability of the completely synchronous state and found three situations where the network topology is such that one can decouple the effects of interaction functions from the structure of the networks and apply the msf approach .",
    "extremely recently , del genio et al . extended this analysis to a broader range of scenarios , again using an msf approach  @xcite , and",
    "show how the  hypernetwork \" model of @xcite is equivalent to a network where nodes have many different interaction types ( or  layers \" of interaction ) .",
    "although these works consider that nodes can interact with one another via different coupling functions , they do not capture the richness of phenomena that can occur in multiplex networks . in a multiplex setting each node exists on each layer of the network .",
    "so if there are @xmath0 layers , there are @xmath0 nodes and each can have a unique state ( see eq .",
    "( [ mlnet0 ] ) below ) , enabling phenomena such as intra - layer and inter - layer synchronization . in the hypernetwork",
    "setting , although each node can have different types of edges to other nodes , each node occurs only once , so it can be in only one state at any given time , restricting the phenomena to global synchronization .",
    "the works discussed thus far focus on complete synchronization . yet , as mentioned , in a multiplex network setting , intra - layer and inter - layer synchronization are two other important coherent behaviors .",
    "for example , gambuzza et .",
    "al @xcite analyzed synchronization of a population of oscillators indirectly coupled through an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the system is formalised in terms of a two - layer network , where the top layer is composed of disconnected oscillators , and the bottom layer consists of oscillators coupled according to a given topology , and each node in the top layer is connected to its counterpart in the bottom layer . by numerical simulations , they have shown the onset of intra - layer synchronization without inter - layer coherence , that is , a state in which the nodes of a layer are synchronized between them without being synchronized with those of the other layer . shortly afterwards , sevilla - escoboza et .",
    "al @xcite investigated the inter - layer synchronization in a duplex network of identical layers , and showed that each node in a given layer can synchronize with its replica in the other layer irrespective of whether or not intra - layer synchronization occurs .",
    "these findings into specific systems provide useful foundations for elucidating a more fundamental approach to analyzing synchronization phenomena in multiplex networks .",
    "based on the above motivations , here we develop a master stability function method for multiplex networks .",
    "this captures an essential feature of multiplex networks , that the inter - layer coupling function can be distinct from the intra - layer coupling function .",
    "thus , distinct from previous approaches , we can analyze different kinds of coherent behaviors , including complete synchronization , intra - layer synchronization and inter - layer synchronization in multiplex networks .",
    "in particular , we derive the master stability equation for a general multiplex network as well as two reduced forms corresponding to only inter - layer or intra - layer interactions .",
    "we then show how three different necessary regions for synchronization can be calculated from the msf of the three master stability equations .",
    "finally we show how to explicitly apply the multiplex msf by analyzing a specific example of two - layer network of rssler oscillators with identical intra - layer topological structures and one - to - one inter - layer connections .",
    "* a multiplex network model . * we consider a multiplex network consisting of @xmath1 layers each consisting of @xmath2 nodes .",
    "the state of the @xmath3-th node in the @xmath0-th layer is specified by @xmath4 , an @xmath5dimensional state vector .",
    "the evolution of the full multiplex system can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes the isolated dynamics for the @xmath3-th node in the @xmath0-th layer , and @xmath8 is a well - defined vector function , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the inner coupling function and coupling strength for nodes within each layer , respectively , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the inner coupling function and coupling strength for nodes across layers , respectively . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ mlnet0 ] ) , the coupling functions between nodes are linear ( thus we can also call @xmath13 and @xmath14 inner coupling matrices ) .",
    "furthermore , the inner coupling matrix for nodes within one layer , @xmath13 , is identical for all layers and the inner coupling matrix for nodes across two layers , @xmath15 , is the same for all pairs of layers .",
    "if the @xmath3-th node is connected with the @xmath16-th node within the @xmath0-th layer , @xmath17 , otherwise @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 similarly , if a node in the @xmath0-th layer is connected with its replica in the @xmath22-th layer , @xmath23 , otherwise @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , for @xmath26    for simplicity , denote + @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 + then the evolution of the multiplex network ( eq .  [ mlnet0 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the supra - laplacian of intra - layer connections and @xmath33 for the supra - laplacian of inter - layer connections . in detail , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here",
    ", @xmath36 is the kronecker product , @xmath37 is the laplacian matrix of nodes within the @xmath0-th layer , and @xmath38 represents the inter - layer laplacian matrix .",
    "more details about supra - laplacians and multiplex network models can be found in refs . @xcite and references therein .    * a master stability function framework for multiplex networks . *",
    "the master stability function method  @xcite is one of the most important methods to study stability of synchronized coupled identical systems .",
    "it simplifies a large - scale networked system to a node - size system via diagonalization and decoupling , as long as the inner coupling functions for all node pairs are identical .",
    "thus , determining whether a network can reach synchronization can be turned into determining whether all the network characteristic modes fall into the corresponding synchronized regions . in the following",
    ", we will establish a master stability framework for multiplex networks with nonidentical inter - layer and intra - layer inner coupling functions .    according to the idea of the master stability framework @xcite , to investigate network synchronization , we can linearize the dynamical equation ( [ mlnet1 ] ) at @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a synchronous state of the network satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes an @xmath1-dimensional vector with all entries being 1 .",
    "we thus obtain the following variational equation : @xmath43\\bm{\\xi},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are symmetric matrices , and satisfy @xmath45 .",

    "we find that the different types of coherent behaviors observed in the network are determined by the intersections of the three necessary regions describing complete synchronization , intra - layer synchronization and inter - layer synchronization .",
    "given a specified network topology , these regions can then be parameterized by the intra- and inter - layer coupling strengths ( i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath12 respectively ) .",
    "complete synchronization is stable when both @xmath10 and @xmath12 fall into the overlap of the three regions .",
    "intra - layer synchronization is stable when both @xmath10 and @xmath12 fall into the overlap of the complete synchronized region and the intra - layer synchronized region .",
    "inter - layer synchronization is stable when both @xmath10 and @xmath12 fall into the overlap of the complete synchronized region and the inter - layer synchronized region .    for a given network nodal dynamics , the complete synchronized region",
    "is mainly determined by both inner coupling matrices @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the intra - layer synchronized region is mainly determined by the intra - layer coupling matrix @xmath13 , and the inter - layer synchronized region by the inter - layer coupling matrix @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in addition to nodal dynamics , the inner coupling function is an essential factor to determine which kind of synchronization the network will arrive at .",
    "if @xmath13 is in such a form that the intra - layer synchronized region is empty , intra - layer synchronization is unstable regardless of however large the intra - layer coupling strength is .",
    "similarly , if @xmath15 is in such a form that the inter - layer synchronized region is empty , inter - layer synchronization is unstable regardless of however large the inter - layer coupling strength is . in either case , complete synchronization will not occur regardless of the coupling strength .",
    "here we have numerically investigated specific duplex networks of rssler oscillators where the two layers have the same topological structure .",
    "our approach can be applied to multiplex networks with different choices for the internal nodal dynamics and different network topologies on different layers .",
    "but it does require that the supra - laplacian matrix of the intra - layer connections is commutative with that of the inter - layer connections .",

    "is that all the transversal lyapunov exponents of the variational equation ( [ vareq2 ] ) are strictly negative .",
    "clearly , these lyapunov exponents depend on the node dynamics @xmath121 , the network intra- and inter - layer coupling strengths @xmath10 and @xmath12 , and the coupling matrices @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , we can get the three master stability equations : eqs .",

    "when the network topologies are given , we can directly calculate the characteristic values of supra - laplacian matrices and parameterize those regions in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath12 , since @xmath137 and @xmath48 .",
    "for example , when @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the nonzero characteristic modes @xmath47 and @xmath138 should lie in @xmath95 , and consequently the region with respect to parameters @xmath10 and @xmath12 is @xmath106 for other combinations of @xmath13 and @xmath15 , the synchronized regions with respect to parameters @xmath10 and @xmath12 can be similarly obtained . * synchronization errors & indicator function . * to measure the extent of intra - layer , inter - layer and complete synchronization , we introduce the following indices : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a norm operator , and @xmath141 is the average state of all the nodes in the @xmath0th layer at time @xmath142 .",
    "thus @xmath143 is the synchronization error of nodes in the @xmath0th layer at time @xmath142 , namely , the intra - layer synchronization error .",
    "similarly , the inter - layer synchronization error is defined as @xmath144 and the complete synchronization error is defined as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the average state of the node @xmath3 in each layer and its counterparts in other layers , and @xmath147 is that of all the nodes in the multiplex network .    with these definitions",
