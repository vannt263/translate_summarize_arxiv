    "previous experimental reports @xcite of the strange - quark contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment , @xmath0 , have involved the poorly understood nucleon anapole moment . however , combining the original proton data with new data from parity violation experiments on the deuteron now allow an independent isolation of @xmath0 . the preliminary analysis",
    "@xcite indicates @xmath0 is smaller than the earlier result @xcite of @xmath3 but positive values for @xmath0 are still favoured .    in this report",
    ", we elucidate the impact of this experimental result on our understanding of the concept of a constituent quark . in particular , the constituent quark approach places properties such as the magnetic moment contribution of a quark to a baryon intrinsic to the constituent quark itself and therefore not dependent upon the environment in which the quark resides .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0 is based on the approximation of charge symmetry in the nucleon moments ; i.e.  equal @xmath4 and @xmath5 current quark masses and negligible electromagnetic corrections .",
    "this approximation is expected to be valid at the 1% level @xcite and is certainly sufficient for the analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "an examination of the symmetries manifest in the qcd path integral for current matrix elements reveals various relationships among the quark sector contributions @xcite .",
    "current matrix elements of hadrons , such as the magnetic moment of the proton , are extracted from the three - point function , a time - ordered product of three operators@xcite .",
    "generally , an operator exciting the hadron of interest from the qcd vacuum is followed by the current of interest , which in turn is followed by an operator annihilating the hadron back to the qcd vacuum . in calculating the three point function ,",
    "one encounters two topologically distinct ways of performing the electromagnetic current insertion .",
    "figure [ topology ] displays skeleton diagrams for these two possible insertions ( with euclidean time increasing to the right ) .",
    "these diagrams may be dressed with an arbitrary number of gluons and quark loops .",
    "the left - hand diagram illustrates the connected insertion of the current to one of the `` valence '' .",
    "these lines can flow backwards as well as forwards in time and therefore have a sea contribution associated with them @xcite .",
    "] quarks of the baryon . in the right - hand diagram",
    "the external field produces a @xmath6 pair which in turn interacts with the valence quarks of the baryon via gluons .",
    "it is important to realize that within the lattice qcd calculation of the loop diagram on the right in fig .",
    "[ topology ] there is no antisymmetrization ( pauli blocking ) of the quark in the loop with the valence quarks . for this reason , in general _ only the sum of the two processes in fig.[topology ] is physical_.    ( 10,5 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 5,5)(0,0 )    ( 5.5,0 )    ( 5,5)(0,0 )",
    "under the assumption of charge symmetry , the three - point correlation functions for octet baryons leads to the following equalities for electromagnetic current matrix elements @xcite : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 denotes the contributions from the quark - loop sector  shown on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ topology ] .",
    "the baryon label represents the magnetic moment .",
    "subscripts allow for environment sensitivity implicit in the three - point function @xcite .",
    "for example , the three - point function for @xmath9 is the same as for the proton , but with @xmath5 replaced by @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the @xmath4-quark propagators in the @xmath9 are multiplied by an @xmath10-quark propagator , whereas in the proton the @xmath4-quark propagators are multiplied by a @xmath5-quark propagator .",
    "the different mass of the neighboring quark gives rise to an environment sensitivity in the @xmath4-quark contributions to observables , which means that the naive expectations of the constituent quark model @xmath11 may not be satisfied @xcite .",
    "this observation should be contrasted with the common assumption that the quark magnetic moment is an intrinsic - quark property which is independent of the quark s environment .",
    "focusing now on the nucleon , we note that for magnetic properties , @xmath12 contains sea - quark - loop contributions from primarily @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath10 quarks . in the su(3)-flavor limit ( @xmath13 )",
    "the charges add to zero and hence the sum vanishes .",
    "however , the heavier strange quark mass allows for a result which is non - zero . by definition @xmath14 and the leading superscript , @xmath15 , reminds the reader that the contributions are loop contributions .",
    "note that , in deriving eq.([ogms ] ) , we have set @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in the constituent quark model @xmath18 .    with",
    "no more than a little accounting , the strange - quark loop contributions to the nucleon magnetic moment , @xmath19 may be isolated from ( [ equalities ] ) and ( [ ogms ] ) in the following two phenomenologically useful forms , @xmath20 \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath21 \\ , .\\ ] ] as we explained above , under the assumption that quark magnetic moments are not environment dependent , these ratios ( i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are taken to be one in many quark models . incorporating the experimentally measured baryon moments leads to : @xmath24 \\ , ,   \\label{ok}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 \\ , , \\label{great}\\ ] ] where all moments are expressed in nuclear magnetons @xmath26 .",
    "( note that the measured magnetic moments are all known sufficiently accurately@xcite that the experimental errors play no role in our subsequent analysis . )",
    "we stress that _ these expressions for @xmath19 are exact consequences of qcd , under the assumption of charge symmetry_. equation ( [ great ] ) provides a particularly favorable case for the determination of @xmath19 with minimal dependence on the valence - quark ratio .",
    "if one considers the quark model suggestions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( [ great ] ) , one finds @xmath29 , a significant departure from the experimental indication of positive values .",
    "equating ( [ ok ] ) and ( [ great ] ) provides a linear relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31 which must be satisfied within qcd .",
    "figure [ selfcons ] displays this relationship by the dashed and solid line , the latter corresponding to values for which @xmath1 when @xmath32 is in the anticipated range @xmath33 .",
    "since the line does not pass through the point @xmath34 corresponding to the simple quark model assumption of universality , the experimentally measured baryon moments are signaling that there must be an environment effect exceeding 12% in both ratios or approaching 20% or more in at least one of the ratios .",
    "moreover , a positive value for @xmath0 requires an environment sensitivity exceeding 70% in the @xmath31 ratio .",
    "hence the experimental indication that @xmath1 challenges the intrinsic magnetic moment concept which is fundamental to the constituent quark model .",
    "one of the major challenges at present in connecting lattice calculations of hadronic properties with the physical world is that computational limitations restrict the accessible quark masses to values an order of magnitude larger than the physical values . at such large masses one is far from the region where chiral perturbation theory is applicable .",
    "yet one knows that for current quark masses near zero there is important non - analytic structure ( as a function of the quark mass ) which must be treated correctly if we are to compare with physical hadron properties .",
    "our present analysis of the strangeness magnetic form factor has been made possible by a recent breakthrough in the treatment of these chiral corrections for the nucleon magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "in particular , a study of the dependence of the nucleon magnetic moments on the input current quark mass , within a chiral quark model which was fitted to existing lattice data , suggested a model independent method for extrapolating baryon magnetic moments which satisfied the chiral constraints imposed by qcd .",
    "we briefly summarize the main results of that analysis :    * a series expansion of @xmath35 in powers of @xmath36 is not a valid approximation for @xmath36 larger than the physical mass , * on the other hand , the behavior of the model , after adjustments to fit the lattice data at large @xmath36 is well determined by the simple pad approximant : @xmath37 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lnacomp ] . * eq.([mag - mom ] ) not only builds in the usual magnetic moment of a dirac particle at moderately large @xmath38 but has the correct leading non - analytic ( lna ) behavior of chiral perturbation theory @xmath39 with @xmath40 a model independent constant . *",
    "fixing @xmath40 at the value given by chiral perturbation theory and adjusting @xmath41 and @xmath42 to fit the lattice data yielded values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , at the physical pion mass .",
    "these are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental values  certainly much closer than the usual linear extrapolations in @xmath47 .",
    "clearly it is vital to extend the lattice calculations of the baryon magnetic moments to lower values of @xmath36 than the 600 mev used in the study just outlined .",
    "it is also vital to include dynamical quarks .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent success of the extrapolation procedure gives us strong encouragement to investigate the same approach for resolving the strange quark contribution to the proton magnetic moment .",
    "our focus here is to extrapolate existing lattice qcd estimates of valance quark contributions to baryon moments @xmath48 to the physical mass regime .",
    "the leading non - analytic pieces of these various contributions to the baryon magnetic moments are proportional to @xmath49 where the pion decay constant @xmath50 mev . isolating a particular quark flavour contribution only requires setting the electric charge of all other quark flavours to zero .",
    "separation of the contributions of the lna terms into valance and sea - quark sectors has been resolved in ref .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath40 for various quark sectors and baryons are summarized in table [ table : chiralcoeff ] . in removing the @xmath4 sea - quark contribution from the @xmath4-quark sector ,",
    "one eliminates the contributions of the @xmath52 sea - quark to the lna term .",
    "since the @xmath53-component of angular momentum in the pion - baryon system is positive , the @xmath52 contribution to the moment is negative .",
    "hence its removal suppresses the non - analyticity in the neutron moment and enhances the non - analyticity in @xmath54 and @xmath9 where the pion cloud acts to enhance the @xmath4-quark sector contribution to these baryon moments .",
    ".coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath40 of ( [ mag - mom ] ) and ( [ lnadef ] ) for the leading nonanalytic ( lna ) contribution of the @xmath4-quark(s ) to the magnetic moment of various baryons .",
    "we express the lna coefficients @xmath40 in terms of the usual su(6 ) constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as well as giving numerical values for @xmath40 and @xmath51 ( which are equivalent through eq.([lnadef ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath4-quark charge has been normalized to 1 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the calculation of @xmath0 , the lna chiral behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is crucial , as the corresponding coefficients are of opposite sign . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of these @xmath4-quark contributions , extrapolated with the correct chiral behavior , will be completely different from the linearly extrapolated ratio . that the signs of these chiral coefficients are opposite may be traced back to the charge of the predominant pion cloud associated with these baryons .",
    "the chiral behavior in the neutron case is dominated by the transition @xmath59 , where there is a contribution from a @xmath60 loop . on the other hand , for the @xmath61 the lna @xmath4-quark contribution",
    "is dominated by the process @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the virtual @xmath63 involves a valence @xmath4-quark  and hence the sign change .    in order to extrapolate the lattice data for valence quarks to the physical pion mass",
    "we use the same approach which worked so well for the neutron and proton moments in ref.@xcite .",
    "that is , we fit the lattice data for the valence quark of flavor @xmath64 in baryon @xmath65 with the form : @xmath66 here @xmath40 are the modified lna chiral coefficients for the valence quarks given in table [ table : chiralcoeff ] ( last column ) and @xmath67 and @xmath42 are fitting parameters",
    ".    figures [ nxiextrap ] and [ psigextrap ] illustrate the extrapolations of the lattice data .",
    "the results of these fits shown at @xmath68 mev are the results of the extrapolation procedure , including fitting errors .",
    "naive linear extrapolations are also shown to help emphasize the dominant role of chiral symmetry in the extrapolation process .    clearly",
    "the effect of the chiral corrections on the extrapolated values of the key magnetic moment ratio @xmath69 at @xmath70 mev is dramatic . instead of the value @xmath71 obtained by linear extrapolation one",
    "now finds @xmath72 .",
    "it is vital that this ratio is much more consistent with the range of values found necessary to yield a positive value of @xmath19 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the ratio @xmath73 at @xmath68 mev is quite stable , changing from @xmath74 in the case of linear extrapolation to @xmath75 when the correct chiral extrapolation is used .",
    "the lattice point illustrated in fig .",
    "[ selfcons ] is consistent with the constraint obtained from charge symmetry .",
    "this suggests that any charge symmetry breaking in the experimentally measured moments is small .",
    "the effect of the chiral extrapolation on the ratio @xmath23 is the most dramatic , changing it from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "( [ great ] ) , which seemed certain to guarantee @xmath78 , no longer does . indeed , using the recent estimate @xcite of @xmath79",
