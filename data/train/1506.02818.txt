    "it was recently reported that over one year in a small los angeles business district , cars cruising for parking burned 47,000 gallons of gasoline and produced 730 tons of carbon dioxide @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the consulting firm mckinsey recently claimed that the average car owner in paris spends four years of his or her life searching for a parking space @xcite .",
    "the parking assignment problem associated with electric vehicles becomes even more acute .",
    "due to the limited range of these vehicles , the marginal cost of expending energy to search for spaces may , in some cities , be prohibitively high .",
    "thus , there is a real and compelling societal and economic need to revisit parking .",
    "increases in car ownership , inadequate public and private parking facilities , and synchronised demand , have led to serious temporal mismatches in parking space supply and demand . finding a parking space at certain times of the day is a non - trivial challenge .",
    "furthermore , finding spaces is not only costly in terms of wasted time for the driver , but it also creates congestion and pollution affecting everyone .",
    "thus , improving parking improves both economic efficiency and environmental quality .",
    "indeed , already major companies and cities are responding to these challenges .",
    "for example , many city authorities , in order to safeguard resident on - street parking from people commuting to a city through the day , have initiated schemes such as resident permit parking , and a number of commercial initiatives have emerged in the parking area .",
    "sfpark and justpark provide examples of city authorities and companies investing heavily in parking research and products within a smart cities context .    in this work ,",
    "our objective is not to revisit prior work on the topic .",
    "rather , we propose a new solution that is widely applicable in cities .",
    "we consider two nearby entities that have complementary supply and demand , i.e. , there is a shortfall of parking space at one and a surplus at the other .",
    "_ we call the entity with a shortfall of parking a _ mini - city_. many examples come to mind : university campuses , technology parks , shopping centers , and government facilities located in the suburbs . in our work ,",
    "we use the university campus as an example .",
    "the second entity is the area surrounding the mini - city . during business hours , while parking spaces are limited in the mini - city , many nearby residents leave home for work . thus , there is an opportunity for the mini - city to use these vacated parking spaces , as well as from schools , hotels , apartment complexes and so on .",
    "consequently , the mini - city has access to two classes of parking spaces : _ premium _ spaces , e.g. , those located on the university campus ; and _ secondary _ spaces located nearby and perhaps serviced by a shuttle .",
    "note that the secondary spaces are not owned by the mini - city but rather are rented from secondary parties or _ landlords_. given this basic scheme , we consider two specific design issues .",
    "first , we wish to guarantee a quality of service for the landlords by setting aside reserve spaces in the mini - city as contingency for events where secondary spaces are suddenly unavailable .",
    "second , we wish to ensure that the premium spaces are allocated optimally among _ users _ ( drivers ) while preserving each user s privacy .",
    "within the research community , questions concerning how to manage parking space supply - demand mismatch are actively being investigated from a variety of different angles .",
    "one important aspect concerns the delivery of up - to - date , accurate , real - time information to parking systems in order to achieve greatest system efficiency .",
    "a car park monitoring and vacancy detection system is discussed in @xcite and consists of a camera and image analysis system that reports statistics .",
    "the aim for such systems is to provide timely information on available parking spaces and minimize search time .",
    "parkya is an early - stage company offering a service that signposts parking locations and allows users to pay for their parking through a smartphone application .",
    "driving directions to the parking spot are additionally available . in the near future",
    ", such services should benefit greatly from incorporating increased amounts of real - time data , concerning up - to - date details on current parking vacancies , and predicted travel times given current road conditions .",
    "the system of @xcite monitors and reports the state of availability of parking spaces and additionally uses context information generated by the city and its citizens to provide accurate responses to demand .",
    "a predictive approach is proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors develop a method in which car parks are able to count the number of arriving and departing cars , and report these to participating cars .",
    "this allows them to predict the likelihood of a parking space being available at the estimated time that the car will arrive there .",
    "this work uses ideas from queueing theory to predict the occupancy upon arrival , with car parks being modelled as single server queues with a poisson arrival process and exponentially distributed service times .",
    "it should be mentioned that this significant reduction in requirements by using a stochastic approach comes at the cost of certainty for the customers .",
    "the lack of a reservation system makes it possible that customers arrive to a fully occupied car park .",
    "the main drawback of the approach is , however , that ultimately the customers will want to use the information to make a decision whether to try their luck and drive to the car park or to go somewhere else .",
    "accordingly , there is feedback embedded in the system which needs to be taken into consideration ; namely , when users choose to drive to a car park based on the predictions made , they then affect the arrival process , rendering the model and predictions no longer valid .",
    "this latter issue is addressed in @xcite , where multiple car park load balancing is achieved using randomisation based on congestion signals from the participating car parks .",
    "significant extensions of this work are given in @xcite .",
    "certainly , access to real - time information , on its own , is not enough . given the delay between an user identifying and driving to a parking space , and the fact that other users may also compete for the same parking space , a successful parking system would benefit from either intelligent assignment or reservation capability to reduce localized congestion @xcite .",
    "the reservation system is championed in @xcite , where an architecture for an intelligent parking assistant is proposed as a public car park management solution . in @xcite ,",
    "the parking problem is viewed as a dynamic resource - allocation problem .",
    "similarities to problems in communication networks are drawn , for which a host of tools and methods have been developed over the last decades .",
    "an online reservation system is proposed , where cars communicate their parking requirements and are assigned a parking space , which is then reserved and can not be used by any other vehicle . a similar approach is proposed in @xcite , albeit with a different assignment routine , and also allows the user to specify the price that he is willing to pay .",
    "the main focus of the paper is revenue maximisation , but it is also possible to achieve other goals , such as reducing traffic levels or ensuring some sort of fairness between users from different social classes .    in @xcite , an agent - based simulation model for parking facilities management was developed , the goal of the tool being to provide better understanding of how complex urban traffic systems evolve under different parking pricing strategies and different levels of parking enforcement .",
    "agents included drivers , parking authorities , law enforcement and city government .",
    "models for cruising - for - parking behaviour were developed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the quality of service ( qos ) metrics is used to dimension a shared vehicle fleet such that satisfactory levels of access to the fleet were ensured to its pool of users . while the topic of @xcite was not parking per se , the paper inspires some of the notions of our current work ; that is , we consider the dimensioning of a special subset of parking spaces in our mini - city that we will call the _ reserve_. we discuss this problem in the following sections of the paper .",
    "we will consider the following scenario .",
    "imagine a university campus with a total of @xmath0 parking spaces , surrounded by a total of @xmath1 private parking spaces ( e.g. , from residential complexes ) , as illustrated in figure [ problem_setup ] .",
    "a typical working day sees the university parking fill to capacity with vehicles belonging to students and staff , to the extent that the @xmath0 spaces can not meet the demand .",
    "some campus arrivals thus have to search elsewhere . at the same time",
    ", many nearby residents drive to work during the day and vacate their @xmath1 private parking spaces .",
    "what we have is a wasted resource in one area ( i.e. , residential parking spaces ) and a stressed resource nearby ( i.e. , the on - campus parking ) .",
    "we assume that a contract exists between the university and the _ landlords _ or owners of these @xmath1 private parking spaces .",
    "the contract stipulates that these landlords lease their driveways to the university during daytime in the sequel , we will denote the time period in which the extra spaces are leased by @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this can be possible because the landlords drive to work during this time period .    in our nomenclature ,",
    "the premium resources are the on - campus parking spaces , while the secondary resources are the contracted residential parking spaces .",
    "we will now consider how to design a parking system , bearing in mind the needs of the mini - city community , and the needs of the landlords .",
    "we shall consider the following facets of the design problem :    1 .",
    "how do we accommodate the needs of parking space owners ( landlords ) given that situations may arise when landlords will need to return home during the contracted interval ?",
    "an example is scheduling a repairman to visit the home to fix a fitting .",
    "( see section [ maths ] . ) 2 .",
    "how do we accommodate the needs of the landlords given that situations arise when misbehaving university members will not vacate the parking space outside of the contracted interval ?",
    "( see section [ maths ] . )",
    "how do we allocate efficiently access to the premium spaces to the university community in a manner that preserves the privacy of individuals in the community ?",
    "( see section [ fair ] . )    as we shall see , we answer these questions in a stochastic framework by developing suitable quality of service ( qos ) metrics to dimension the aforementioned parking system . to address items 1 and 2 , we shall set aside a subset of @xmath3 premium spaces as a reserve .",
    "the research question in this latter context then becomes how to use the qos metrics to dimension the size of @xmath3 .",
    "we shall address item 3 by applying recent ideas from distributed resource allocation .",
    "* comment : ( generalization ) * the parking scenario presented in this paper is very specific , but our method can also be applied in the following general setting .",
    "there are two resources , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these resources are atomic ( indivisible ) , with each atom being allocated to one user .",
    "each user has a preference over the two resources . using resources @xmath4 and @xmath5 decreases a certain qos metric . in the following main sections , we answer two questions :    * given a qos requirement ,",
    "how much of resource @xmath4 and resource @xmath5 should we use ? * given an efficiency metric derived from the user preferences ,",
    "how do we allocate the resources optimally among users in a setting where the allocation is repeated over multiple iterations ?",
    "in this section , we consider the problem of dimensioning @xmath6 premium spaces as _ reserve _ in order to provide sufficient quality of service ( qos ) guarantees to the landlords of the secondary spaces .",
    "let @xmath7 index the landlords of the parking spaces .",
    "for each such landlord @xmath8 , we define a non - negative valued random variable @xmath9 , which denotes the time at which he or she returns home and needs to get the parking space back . under normal circumstances , @xmath9 is greater than @xmath10 , but on rare occasions a landlord may choose to come home early .    for simplicity ,",

    "in this section , we consider the point of view of the user ( i.e. a staff member or student ) who requires parking at the university .",
    "typically , such a user would purchase a monthly or yearly parking ticket .",
    "this ticket then provides them with the opportunity to compete for a university parking space .",
    "however , such a ticket does not necessarily guarantee them a parking space on the university grounds .",
    "that is , if they arrive to the university `` too late '' on any given day , the car parks on - campus may already be full .",
    "this is because more parking tickets are sold than there are actual spaces to park .",
    "such `` first come , first served ''",
    "systems can be inefficient .",
    "consider the example of a studying mother or father who , even though they paid the same amount for a monthly or yearly parking ticket as everyone else , must first always take their children to school in the morning .",
    "they thus always arrive to the campus a little bit later than everyone else and have a greater chance of missing out on an on - campus parking space .",
    "we are interested in a scheme that offers equality in regards to access to the premium , on - campus parking spaces for all university users over the long - term period of validity of their parking ticket .    for our scheme , we suppose that the university has been able to obtain enough apartment building parking spaces such that @xmath44 is greater than or equal to the number of university users requiring a parking space on any given day .",
    "the problem then is how to allocate the premium and secondary parking spaces to users efficiently over time .",
    "how do we ensure that one campus user does not have to park off - campus for the majority of the time while another user is almost always offered a car space on the university grounds ?",
    "our solution to this problem is motivated by additive - increase / multiplicative - decrease ( aimd ) optimisation algorithms @xcite .",
    "we now consider the problem of providing efficient access to the available premium spaces at the mini - city .",
    "these spaces refer to the @xmath45 spaces available after allocating @xmath3 of the spaces as reserve according to the previous section . for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath46 in this section , but the results generalize in a straightforward fashion .",
    "we introduce and recall the following notation to describe the problem data and the variables used in our algorithm .    * an integer denoting the number of available premium parking spaces . *",
    "an integer denoting the number of users wishing to avail of premium parking spaces .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 .",
    "* denotes discrete time , @xmath48 . in our interpretation",
    "this corresponds to the number of days the system is operating . for convenience ,",
    "we assume spaces are assigned on a per - day basis , but the general principles of the algorithm do not depend on this assumption .",
    "* this is a state variable associated with the @xmath12th user .",

    ", one could require that that the long - term average admission to the premium parking space is equal for all users , i.e. for all @xmath52 @xmath53 this assumes that all users are equal in the desire to access the premium parking space .",

    "this function specifies the priority that this user is assigned . it could represent the amount a user is willing to pay , or it could be related to the number of passengers carried by this users , or the access that this user has to public transportation ( meaning that users with fewer possibilities for alternative transport should have prioritised access to parking spaces ) . given these individual cost functions , our aim is to design a system that achieves overall minimal cost for the group .",
    "we formulate the optimal allocation of resources as a minimization problem : @xmath58    our proposed simple algorithm for solving the parking allocation problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "we assume that every event each user is allocated access to the premium spaces by tossing a coin .",
    "for example , one embodiment of this idea is to use a smart - phone application .",
    "more specifically , each user is assigned a cost function by a government authority .",
    "for example , this could be based on vehicle class , disability , need for childcare , etc . on every subsequent day , the application outputs a variable that determines whether the user is assigned a premium space .",
    "access to the space is assigned to the @xmath12th user with the following probability : @xmath59 a central authority that owns the parking spaces , calculates @xmath60 based on past utilization and broadcasts this scalar to all participating vehicles .",
    "the following example illustrates the performance of this simple algorithm .",
    "we will assume that the functions @xmath61 are continuously differentiable and strictly convex ; so that in particular the optimal point @xmath62 satisfying the constraints is unique .",
    "furthermore , we introduce an assumption which ensures that the optimal point @xmath63 has only positive entries .",
    "this assumption also guarantees that the algorithm we will describe is well defined for every user .",
    "we wish to control the access to the premium space in such a way that the average utilization for each user approaches the optimal value @xmath63 , i.e. for large @xmath50 we want to achieve @xmath64 subject to the ( loose ) capacity constraint @xmath65 .",
    "that is , all premium spaces are occupied , on average .",
    "further , we wish to do this in a manner that preserves the privacy of users .",
    "that is , we do not wish to reveal @xmath66 and @xmath61 to any other users in the course of the optimization .",
    "finally , the necessary communication between the users should be minimal so as not to create a communication overhead that would be hard to sustain in an uncertain environment where users can not be expected to participate at all times .    in what follows",
    "the mechanism for preserving privacy is to develop a distributed algorithm .",
    "we loosely follow the ideas in @xcite , where a distributed stochastic algorithm is presented which guarantees that the average utilization variables @xmath67 converge to the optimal points @xmath68 , which is also called almost sure convergence in a stochastic context . ] .",
    "the algorithm presented here extends the ideas of @xcite , however , because we wish to ensure in addition that the instantaneous utilization variables @xmath69 sum to @xmath0 , or at least to a value close to it .",
    "moreover , the resource to be allocated in our setting is atomic , as opposed to arbitrarily divisible .",
    "these differences require substantial changes to the algorithm presented in @xcite .    at each time",
    "@xmath50 , each user @xmath12 determines a probability @xmath70 and sets @xmath71 where we note that all users make this probabilistic choice independently of other users or previous decisions .",
    "the evolution of the probabilities is governed by the equation @xmath72 note that each user @xmath12 can determine its own probability with the exclusive knowledge of its own past utilization @xmath73 and cost function @xmath61 .",
    "no information from other users is required .",
    "the scalar @xmath60 is a network wide constant determined by the central agency and broadcast to all users . here",
    ", @xmath60 is chosen such that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 and all @xmath76 .",
    "it is determined in a time - varying manner as it also influences the demand for premium spaces .",
    "specifically , if at a certain time @xmath50 each @xmath70 is fixed then the expected utilization of the premium spaces is @xmath77 moreover , the ( random ) instantaneous utilization @xmath78 is concentrated around the expected utilization by independence and hoeffding s inequality .",
    "if we wish to ensure optimal utilization of the premium spaces and avoid overbooking , the expected utilization should be below the number of premium parking spaces .",
    "for instance , a standard deviation below this number , depending on the desired quality - of - service metric .",
    "denoting this number by @xmath79 , we will therefore adjust @xmath60 so that the expectation in tracks @xmath80 . as the expectation is unknown ,",
    "we use the observed utilization as an estimator for this . taking a simple error regulation approach we thus arrive at @xmath81    the overall system is now prescribed by the dynamics of @xmath82 given by , the dynamics of @xmath83 given by and the dynamics of @xmath84 as described in .",
    "a proof of the convergence of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we present below an example to show its efficacy .       for three users.,height=240 ]            , height=240 ]        we simulate a population of 900 users competing for 450 premium parking spaces .",
    "each evening , users are assigned a parking space as described above ( with the scalar @xmath60 determined using a pi control ) . for simplicity ,",
    "users have one of three cost functions : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , all of which are strictly convex .",
    "figure [ fig : ap ] shows the average utilisation achieved for each class of vehicle .",
    "figure  [ fig : pu ] and  [ fig : occ ] shows that the average utilisation of premium spaces is concentrated around the target utilisation of 450 .",
    "figure [ fig : gain ] shows the evolution of the controller gain and figure [ fig : con ] shows that the cost functions derivatives do actually achieve consensus asymptotically .      here",
    "we will briefly comment on the heuristic which suggests that the algorithm works in a general setting . to this end",
    "we have to point out that a number of assumptions are required .",
    "first , in our derivation of the update rule we will rely on an infinitesimal characterization of the optimal point .",
    "this requires that the optimal point does not lie on the boundary of the constraint set .",
    "thus in the following we will assume that the optimal point @xmath63 satisfies @xmath88    second , the gain parameter @xmath89 in the feedback scheme needs to be chosen in such a manner that the system is stable .",
    "noting that by the expectation @xmath90 is a multiple of @xmath60 , we choose @xmath91 where the maximum with respect to @xmath92 is taken over the constraint set .",
    "we then reformulate to obtain @xmath93 in the previous formulation , the bracket giving the factor of @xmath60 needs to be in the interval @xmath94 sufficiently often to ensure stable behaviour of the system and thus the desired tracking property .",
    "the choice of @xmath89 in is made to ensure that the desired stability property holds .",
    "this ensures convergence of the sequence @xmath60 .    to argue for the convergence of @xmath95 we follow the heuristic presented in @xcite .",
    "the optimisation problem is a constrained problem for which we have assumed that the boundary conditions @xmath96 are not active .",
    "it is then classical to introduce the lagrange parameter @xmath97 and consider the lagrangian @xmath98 from the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.5.3 ) , the following necessary and sufficient condition for optimality can be obtained by setting all partial derivatives to zero . in the optimal point @xmath99 ,",
    "@xmath100 we have @xmath101 in other words , the system is at optimality when the derivatives of the cost functions are in consensus .",
    "this observation is at the core of the choice of the probability functions in as we now explain .    assuming that the system described by , , and has an ergodicity property we obtain the long - term average for the access to the premium car park satisfies ( in the limit ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the steady state probability that user @xmath12 has access to the resource . given this assumption , we claim that our choice of probability functions @xmath70 is such that the equation for the steady state behaviour of our system is equivalent to the kkt condition . by each user",
    "has a probability of access that satisfies @xmath104 where the constant of proportionality is the same for all users .",
    "suppose now that after a transient period we have @xmath105 , the steady state long - run average which exists under our ergodicity assumption",
    ". then we can write @xmath106 .",
    "thus , in steady state , @xmath107 and so @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "so in the limit we expect @xmath110 for all @xmath12 .",
    "this means that in the limit we converge to a situation where the derivatives of the cost functions are in consensus . as we have seen from the kkt conditions the consensus conditions characterizes the optimal point of the optimization problem so that we obtain @xmath111 thus the average utilization converges to the optimal point .",
    "several comments are merited .",
    "* this is a private algorithm .",
    "users do not communicate with other users , nor do they reveal any state information or cost information to the central authority .",
    "* this is a randomized algorithm .",
    "thus we only have @xmath112 .",
    "we argue that small fluctuations in the occupancy level about the capacity is acceptable since some users may not use the premium spaces , even if allocated one .",
    "furthermore , in the event of all users availing of their allocated premium spaces , extra space is always available in the secondary spaces , and in the reserved spacing .",
    "that is , the instantaneous allocation @xmath113 may exceed the capacity @xmath0 for some time steps @xmath50 , in which case , some users will have to be re - routed to the secondary parking spaces .",
    "* the algorithm can be modified such that the parameter @xmath84 does not update at every iteration , but once in a while ( i.e. , from day to day ) . *",
    "the proposed allocation scheme can be applied to more general problems of the form of .",
    "for example , the same problem arises also in assigning space in overhead bins on passenger planes , seats in trains , etc . in all of these examples , users",
    "pay a fee to compete for access to a limited resource",
    ". however , access to the resource is not guaranteed and in effect the resource is allocated in a first - come , first - served manner . from a societal viewpoint , customers with constraints , e.g. dropping children at school , are almost always disadvantaged by such schemes .",
    "in this work , we have modeled two aspects of parking system design and proposed two corresponding solutions .",
    "first , we propose to complement primary or premium parking spaces with a large number of secondary parking spaces .",
    "these spaces are obtained through contracts for shared use that provide probabilistic qos guarantees at the expense of a relatively small number of reserve premium spaces .",
    "secondly , we propose a distributed algorithm for repeated allocation of premium spaces , which guarantees that , over time , the users who benefit most from such spaces obtain them proportionally more frequently .",
    "the main feature of this algorithm is to keep private all information related to the benefit derived by individual users .",
    "the next step in our research agenda is to deploy the described system on a university campus . from an algorithmic perspective",
    ", it remains an open problem to quantify the rate of convergence of @xmath114 and to situations where we have dynamic arrivals and departures throughout each day .",
    "another open problem is to quantify the probability of overshooting the capacity : i.e. , the event @xmath115 .",
    "it is also useful to consider a version of the allocation algorithm for the case where a different subset of users competes in each day .",
