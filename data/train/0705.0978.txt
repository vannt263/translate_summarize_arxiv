    "* ) , or not an active radio pulsar at all .",
    "potential obstacles to the interpretation of  as a rotation - powered pulsar were identified in paper  1 .",
    "the newly reduced upper limit on its @xmath139 , by more than 2 orders of magnitude , turns those difficulties into major objections .",
    "first , the x - ray luminosity of , @xmath7 ergs  s@xmath3 , is comparable to the @xmath1 upper limit on its spin - down power , @xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , it may be difficult to power the x - ray source with spin - down energy . since the x - ray spectrum is consistent with thermal emission , what about residual cooling of the neutron star ? while the x - ray luminosity of  is consistent with minimal ns cooling curves for an age of @xmath140  yr @xcite , its blackbody temperature implies an emitting area that is just @xmath141 of the ns surface . even taking into account",
    "that , in a real ns atmosphere , a blackbody fit overestimates the effective temperature and underestimates the area , the highly modulated x - ray pulse must come from a small hot spot .",
    "although anisotropic conduction in a magnetized ns can enforce temperature gradients on the surface , such models @xcite do not show spots as small and as hot as observed here . instead , an external source of localized heating may be needed .",
    "the open - field - line polar cap is the most likely target area for external heating of the ns surface , with the energy ultimately drawn from rotation .",
    "the canonical area of the polar cap is @xmath142  @xmath47 ; this is @xmath143 of the area implied by the blackbody fit to the x - ray spectrum . among theories of polar - cap heating , a maximum thermal luminosity",
    "is predicted by @xcite from the outer - gap model for @xmath144-ray pulsars . in this analysis ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the hot polar cap is limited by the goldreich - julian @xmath145 current flow of @xmath146  s@xmath3 depositing an average energy per particle @xmath147  ergs .",
    "the maximum luminosity is @xmath148  ergs  s@xmath3 . here , the fraction @xmath149 of the current reaching the surface is set to its estimated maximum value of @xmath150 .",
    "polar - cap heating models of @xcite predict even less x - ray luminosity than @xcite .",
    "therefore , current theories fall short of predicting the temperature and luminosity of the x - ray emission from  in the context of a spinning - down neutron star .",
    "after the unexplained x - ray properties , a lesser problem for  as an isolated pulsar is its characteristic age @xmath119  myr , which exceeds by 3 orders of magnitude the snr age , estimated dynamically as @xmath151  kyr @xcite .",
    "this would require the pulsar to have been born at its current period to be associated with the snr . while not fundamentally contradicting the rotation - powered hypothesis , this result is a definite example in support of a recent population analysis that favors a wide distribution of radio pulsar birth periods @xcite , even though  is not itself a radio pulsar .",
    "furthermore , as magnetic field is generated by a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate of the proto - neutron star @xcite , it is natural that long - period pulsars would have the weaker @xmath13-fields at birth , and the model of @xcite shows this .",
    "@xcite also find that a slowly rotating ns should have its @xmath13-field confined to small - scale regions , with the global dipole that is responsible for spin - down absent .",
    "finally , we note that there are no young radio pulsars known with @xmath14  g. all such weakly magnetized radio pulsars are either very old , with @xmath16  myr @xcite , or are recycled , the result of accretion from a binary companion .",
    "@xcite conclude that there is no evidence for magnetic field decay during the radio emitting life of a pulsar , so the observered distribution of @xmath152 should resemble its birth distribution",
    ". among the @xmath152 distribution of ordinary ( not recycled ) radio pulsars ,  is certainly in the bottom 10% , and maybe lower .",
    "may become a radio pulsar in the far future , but its weak @xmath13-field may be preventing radio emission now by permitting accretion . while there is no evidence of a close binary companion in the timing of ( see paper  1 ) , it is possible that low - level accretion of sn debris prevents it and other radio - quiet ccos from becoming radio pulsars for thousands or even millions of years .",
    "we next consider whether the hypothesis of accretion from such a fallback disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) better explains the x - ray timing and spectral properties of .",
    "the fact that @xmath139 is so small leads us to review the viability of accretion of supernova debris through a disk .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of  can be powered by accretion of @xmath153 g  s@xmath3 , or only @xmath154 lunar masses of supernova debris over the past 7.5  kyr .",
    "the main barrier to disk accretion is the speed - of - light cylinder , of radius @xmath155  cm .",
    "if an accretion disk can not penetrate the light cylinder , the ns can not interact with the disk , and it behaves as a isolated pulsar .",
    "but if @xmath152 is as small as @xmath46  g , accretion at a rate @xmath156  g  s@xmath3 can penetrate the light cylinder , since the magnetospheric radius is then @xmath157 where the magnetic moment @xmath158 g  @xmath159 .",
    "if so , the system is in the propeller regime , in which matter flung out from @xmath160 at a rate @xmath161 takes angular momentum from the ns , causing it to spin down .",
    "the propeller spin - down rate is estimated as @xmath162 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "here @xmath163 g  @xmath47 is the ns moment of inertia , and @xmath164  s is the equilibrium , or minimum period for disk accretion that is reached when @xmath165 .",
    "the corotation radius is @xmath166^{1/3 } = 3.7 \\times 10 ^ 7 $ ]  cm .",
    "while we have not measured a significant @xmath139 in order to determine the needed @xmath161 , we can adopt the @xmath1 upper limit , @xmath116 , as an estimate of @xmath139 . combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we have in the propeller scenario @xmath167 @xmath168 we must distinguish here between @xmath161 , the matter expelled that is responsible for the torque on the ns , and @xmath153  g  s@xmath3 , the matter accreted , which is responsible for the x - ray emission from the surface , presumably at a magnetic pole of the neutron star .",
    "for the propeller model to be self - consistent , @xmath161 must be @xmath169 , which is possible according to equation ( 3 ) as long as @xmath12  g. even so , @xmath161 does not contribute significantly to the x - ray luminosity because of the much weaker gravitational potential at the magnetospheric radius @xmath160 from which it is expelled .",
    "if @xmath152 is as small as @xmath170  g , then  is not a propeller , but a `` slow rotator , '' with @xmath165 and @xmath171 . in this spin - up regime",
    ", it would be even more difficult to measure @xmath139 , since @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "these equations also apply during the prior evolution of the pulsar and show that , even if the accretion rate was orders of magnitude higher in the past , the spin - up and spin - down times @xmath173 are much longer than the age of the snr .",
    "there has not been enough time for propeller accretion to have spun the pulsar down from a much smaller @xmath113 , so even in this model it was born at essentially its present @xmath113 .    thus , we regard either propeller spindown or accretion in a weak magnetic field as consistent with the x - ray spectral and timing properties of .",
    "if accreting , its emitting region could be larger than the open - field - line polar cap because it would be connected to magnetic field lines extending to @xmath160 , which is @xmath174 .",
    "neither equation ( 3 ) nor equation ( 4 ) requires there to be much torque noise at the level that present data can measure .",
    "while detected flickering is an indicator of accretion in x - ray binaries even in quiescence @xcite , we do not have strong evidence of variability of .",
    "but it is not clear that the processes in binaries can be extrapolated to accretion at such low rates from a fossil disk . finally ,",
    "because of the large distance and interstellar extinction to , as well as its crowded optical field , existing optical data do not rule out the presence of a fallback accretion disk around ( see paper  1 for details ) .      difficulties in understanding the timing behavior of another cco , the 424-ms pulsar @xcite , were resolved recently by @xcite , who showed that it is a steady rotator with @xmath176 ergs  s@xmath3 and @xmath177  g. this makes very similar to  in its physical parameters .",
    "accretion from a fossil disk of supernova debris @xcite was one of the theories considered by @xcite to explain the now defunct timing irregularities of .",
    "but accretion may still be needed to explain the radio - quiet nature of , and the details of its x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , unlike , upper limits on optical / ir emission from are comparable to what is expected from a geometrically thin , optically thick disk accreting at the rate required to account for its x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may prove necessary to invoke a radiatively inefficient flow , or perhaps even accretion of solid particles @xcite , in order to proceed with this theory for .",
    "we propose that this may be the first phase in the life of those neutron stars born rotating slowly , and with weak magnetic fields .",
    "a unique phenomenon displayed by  is the set of broad absorption lines in its soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "they are centered at @xmath178  kev and @xmath179  kev @xcite , and possibly at 2.1  kev and 2.8  kev @xcite , although the reality of the two higher - energy features has been disputed @xcite .",
    "proposed absorption mechanisms include electron cyclotron in a weak ( @xmath180  g ) magnetic field @xcite , atomic features from singly ionized helium in a strong ( @xmath181",
    "g ) field @xcite , and oxygen or neon in a normal ( @xmath182  g ) field @xcite .",
    "a detailed critique of these models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we only remark that : ( 1 ) local values of @xmath13 measured from x - ray spectral features may differ from the global dipole @xmath13 that is measured by timing , especially if the dipole component is weak @xcite , and ( 2 ) the attractive feature of the electron cyclotron model for , the equal energy spacing of its lines , is in harmony with the present work on  which , by different arguments , requires a weak surface magnetic field .",
    "@xcite argued that electron cyclotron harmonics of roughly equal depth could be produced because , even though the oscillator strength of the harmonic is much less than that of the fundamental , resonant cyclotron radiative transfer could equalize the line strengths .",
    "@xcite also explained how objections to the cyclotron model involving the relative oscillator strengths can be overcome by assuming that the fundamental is optically thick while the harmonic is optically thin , resulting in comparable equivalent widths .",
    "they also proposed a specific geometry that accounts for the strength of the lines , which also accommodates the small pulsed fraction observed from .",
    "this involves a column rising along the magnetic axis and viewed from the side .",
    "finally , @xcite remarked that such a column may be more easily maintained in an accretion scenario .",
    "while the lower - quality spectra of  do not yet show evidence of absorption features , cyclotron lines could be weak if either the column density in which they are formed or the viewing geometry is not favorable , or especially if the magnetic field is so small as to shift them below the observable x - ray band .",
    "the fitted interstellar column density to , @xmath183  @xmath25 , is much larger than that to , @xmath184  @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the soft x - ray region in which the strongest lines in  are seen is partly suppressed in the case of . finally , it is possible that the x - ray spectrum of  is not a pure blackbody as fitted , but is affected by unmodelled , broad cyclotron absorption at the low - energy end .",
    "the half dozen ccos ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are similar in their x - ray luminosities and temperatures .",
    "therefore , they may be compatible with the model that we propose for  and",
    ". the only piece of evidence that sharply contradicts such unification is the apparent historical outburst of the cco in the cas  a snr that was inferred from infrared light echos detected with the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "the geometry and sharpness of the echos implies that beamed emission from the central source flared for less than a few weeks about 50 years ago , and the radiation reprocessed into thermal emission from dust require an equivalent isotropic flare of @xmath185  ergs .",
    "because such energetic outbursts are seen on similar timescales from soft gamma - ray repeaters , @xcite proposed that the cas  a cco is a quiescent magnetar , at the other extreme of magnetic field strength from . a convincing determination of the magnetic field strengths of the cas  a cco and others will have to await discovery of their pulsations .",
    "it has long been recognized that the non - detection of the expected pulsar in the remnant of sn  1987a can be explained if the ns was born with a weak magnetic field or a long rotation period @xcite , and that several ccos , including the one in cas  a , would be undetected if placed in sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "however , it was not established until now that a cco can have essentially the same spin - down luminosity at birth that it has at an age of 400 or @xmath186  yr , i.e. , that it is born with both a weak @xmath13-field and a long @xmath113 .",
    "this new result means that a common type of neutron star can emit less than the observed limits from sn  1987a even if 100% of its spin - down power is reprocessed into ir emission by dust in the surrounding sn ejecta .",
    "the relevant luminosity limits to be satisfied for a point source inside the ring of sn  1987a are @xmath187 ergs  s@xmath3 corrected for extinction @xcite , @xmath188   ) @xmath189 ergs  s@xmath3 corrected for dust absorption @xcite , and @xmath190 ergs  s@xmath3 for dust emitting at @xmath191  k @xcite .",
    "this mid - ir luminosity can be accounted for by radioactive decay of @xmath192ti , and therefore represents a very conservative upper limit on the spin - down power of an embedded pulsar .",
    "at an age of @xmath193  yr , a cooling ns need emit only @xmath194 ergs  s@xmath3 of soft x - rays at a temperature of @xmath195  k @xcite , some of which is absorbed by sn ejecta or ism in the lmc .",
    "the upper limit on spin - down power from , @xmath2 ergs  s@xmath3 , is a challenge to detect in sn  1987a , and @xmath176 ergs  s@xmath3 from  would be impossible .",
    "so we conclude that a cco is a promising model for the unseen ns in sn  1987a .",
    "we obtained three new x - ray timing points on  that , in combination with two previous observations , reveal no significant change in spin period on time scales ranging from 1 week to 2.4 yr . in the dipole spin - down formalism",
    ", this implies @xmath2 ergs  s@xmath3 and @xmath4  g. such a low @xmath13-field is not seen in young radio pulsars , and while it does not demand a special explanation , it does favor accretion as a source of the small , hot thermal region that is responsible for the highly modulated x - ray pulsations , which may exceed the spin - down power of the isolated ns , and strains any plausible interior cooling or external heating model .",
    "we showed that the observered spin period , 105 ms , in combination with a weak field , @xmath196  g , would allow disk accretion in the propeller regime , which may be a more satisfactory model overall .",
    "if @xmath152 is even weaker , @xmath197  g ,  could be a `` slow '' accretor .",
    "considering also the properties of the cco , we speculated that this class may have weak magnetic fields as a result of slow natal rotation , which enables them to accrete .",
    "while we do not decisively favor accretion over a rotation - powered pulsar , we emphasize that for  a weak magnetic field is an unavoidable feature of either interpretation .",
    "such low-@xmath13 births may be very common if they also occurred in cas  a and/or sn  1987a .",
    "a radio pulsar detection of  would demonstrate cleanly that it is rotation powered , but our negative results so far are inconclusive because there are several reasons why a rotation - powered pulsar may not be detected in radio . continued x - ray monitoring will provide a more sensitive test for spin - down or accretion torques , perhaps eventually in a definitive manner , and more evidence of whether or not the x - ray flux and pulse profile are variable .",
    "it is now important to obtain a phase - connected timing solution , the most efficient and sensitive method of measuring a small @xmath139 .",
    "if obtained soon , a well - timed series of observations should allow a coherent solution to be fitted retroactively back to 2004 .",
    "also , considering the possibility that a weak magnetic field and accretion may be responsible for the absorption lines in the soft x - ray spectrum of , a deeper x - ray spectral study of  may be revealing .",
    "finally , in order to test the general applicability of these ideas to the class of ccos , more sensitives searches for their pulsations are required .",
    "this investigation is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
