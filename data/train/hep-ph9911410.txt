    "positronium ( ps ) , an electron - positron bound state , is the lightest known atom .",
    "its gross spectrum is similar to that of the hydrogen , except for a different reduced mass , @xmath2 , and denote electron s mass and charge by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . ]",
    "ps is of significant theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "in contrast to the hydrogen , it does not contain a proton and its theoretical description is not limited by hadronic uncertainties , at least at the present level of experimental accuracy .",
    "spectrum and lifetimes of ps states can be predicted within quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with very high accuracy .",
    "recently , significant progress in qed theory of positronium spectrum has been achieved .",
    "effects @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite were calculated .",
    "some progress has also been made in the study of the positronium annihilation rate , which we will discuss below . combined with precise experimental measurements",
    ", these results provide unique opportunities for testing bound - state theory based on qed .",
    "for example , one can study recoil effects in detail because in ps they are not suppressed by a small mass ratio ( as opposed to e.g. muonium ) .",
    "in addition , precise studies of positronium decays provide bounds on exotic particles , such as axions , paraphotons , or millicharged particles .",
    "this short note is devoted to a review of the standard and some exotic positronium decay channels .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the decay into neutrinos , where we find disagreement with previously published results .",
    "in the @xmath8 state of ps , spins of the electron and positron can combine to give either a total spin 0 singlet state ( parapositronium , p - ps ) , or a spin 1 triplet ( orthopositronium , o - ps ) . because of the possibility of @xmath9 annihilation , both states are unstable . barring @xmath10-violating effects ( e.g. caused by the weak interactions )",
    ", the ground state of parapositronium ( singlet ) can annihilate into only even number of photons ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "of the two spin states of ps , only o - ps ( spin 1 state ) can decay weakly into a pair @xmath11 , at least if the neutrinos are massless and if there is no emission of photons .",
    "two amplitudes contribute to the decay @xmath12 : @xmath13 exchange in @xmath14 channel and an annihilation via @xmath15 .",
    "the rate of this decay is @xmath16 is the mass of the ps , @xmath17 comes from the phase space , and the square of the wave function at the origin is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bohr radius of the ps .",

    "s\\equiv \\sin\\theta_w\\,.\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the minus sign between the two terms is due to the different ordering of the fermion fields .",
    "it leads to a destructive interference of the @xmath13 and @xmath15 exchange amplitudes .",
    "the decay rate is @xmath21 which corresponds to a totally negligible branching ratio of about @xmath22 .",
    "we note that after fierz transformation of the @xmath13 exchange diagram , the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath23 decay coincides with the well known hamiltonian for the neutrino - electron scattering @xcite @xmath24    the decay @xmath12 was discussed in ref .",
    "our result differs from both publications . in ref .  @xcite the relative minus sign between the @xmath13 and @xmath15 exchange amplitudes was left out , so that the interference was constructive . in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a mistake in the trace calculation so that the decay seems to arise only due to the axial , rather than vector , part of the effective hamiltonian .    for other flavors of the final state neutrinos",
    "only the annihilation diagram contributes . since the vector coupling of @xmath15 to electrons is proportional to @xmath25 , these channels",
    "are strongly suppressed compared to the electron ",
    "neutrino final state .",
    "we find for @xmath26 @xmath27 the branching ratio for each non - electron neutrino flavor is about @xmath28 , much smaller than the experimental limits ( cf . table [ tless ] ) .",
    "certainly it can not explain the `` orthopositronium lifetime puzzle . ''",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the influence of weak interactions on the lifetimes of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 bound states .",
    "dimuonium ( dm ) is a bound state of a muon and an anti - muon . the spectrum @xcite , qed @xcite decay modes and possible production @xcite of such a system have been studied recently .",
    "in contrast to orthopositronium , the decay rate of orthodimuonium ( @xmath31 ) is of order @xmath32 because of conversion into the the electron ",
    "positron pair via a virtual single ",
    "photon annihilation , @xmath33 in addition to the dominant qed decay channel , @xmath31 can decay into neutrinos or electrons via an annihilation amplitude with a @xmath15-boson exchange .",
    "the decay width into muon neutrinos is given by a formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee ] ) , with muon mass substituted for @xmath3 ; the width into other neutrino flavors is obtained similarly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : othernu ] ) .    in case of the decay o - dm@xmath34 ,",
    "the @xmath15 contribution is a tiny correction to the photon exchange : @xmath35\\over 32\\pi^2\\alpha^2 } \\right).\\ ] ] the two correction terms correspond , respectively , to the interference between the photon and @xmath15 amplitudes , and to the square of the @xmath15 amplitude .",
    "muonium ( mu ) consists of an electron and an antimuon .",
    "its decays have recently been discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "the electroweak interactions can lead to its decay via a @xmath13 exchange in the @xmath14 channel . for the decay width of a bound state of particles with unequal masses we use @xmath36 which leads to @xmath37 this formula",
    "can also be derived from known results in @xmath38 decays @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed the confrontation of theoretical and experimental results concerning decays of positronium .",
    "we believe that the `` orthopositronium lifetime puzzle '' is not likely to be solved by large two - loop qed corrections , nor by a discovery of an exotic decay channel .",
    "we have investigated in some detail the annihilation amplitude into neutrinos and found that its contribution is negligible .",
    "in fact it is even smaller than the results previously cited in the literature .",
    "most likely , the situation will be clarified by the future improved experiments , and we are looking forward to their results .",
