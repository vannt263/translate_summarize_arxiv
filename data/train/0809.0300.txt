    "in his foundational work on buildings , j.tits @xcite proved that all thick irreducible spherical and affine buildings of rank @xmath0 ( including nondiscrete ones ) are associated with algebraic groups and , hence , have weyl groups coming from root systems .",
    "he then showed @xcite how to use the _ free construction _ to prove existence of thick spherical buildings of rank 2 modeled on arbitrary finite coxeter groups ( see definition [ modeled ] ) .",
    "such buildings are necessarily infinite except for dihedral groups of the order @xmath1 .",
    "m.ronan @xcite constructed a variety of irreducible rank 2 discrete affine buildings not coming from algebraic groups .",
    "the corresponding finite coxeter groups are necessarily of crystallographic type , i.e. , they are the dihedral groups @xmath2 .",
    "however , examples of nondiscrete affine buildings of rank 2 corresponding to the rest of finite dihedral groups remained elusive .",
    "the main result of this paper is a construction of such buildings .",

    "take a countable dense subgroup @xmath5 of translations of the apartment @xmath6 , invariant under the action of @xmath7 by conjugations , so that for the group @xmath8 ( which is , in fact , a coxeter group ) , every vertex of the coxeter complex @xmath9 is special .",
    "such coxeter complexes will be called _",
    "special_. for instance , when @xmath10 is a prime number , the complex @xmath9 is special no matter what @xmath5 is .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove    [ main ] for every special coxeter complex @xmath9 with nondiscrete countable group @xmath11 , there exists a thick euclidean building @xmath12 of rank 2 modeled on @xmath9 .    after proving this theorem we found out that for @xmath13 , existence of thick euclidean buildings ( for some countable @xmath11 ) was also proven in a recent work of p.hitzelberger , l.kramer and r.weiss @xcite by a totally different method : their buildings are embedded in buildings of the type @xmath14 .",
    "it is quite likely that theorem [ main ] holds for semidirect products @xmath11 of @xmath7 with arbitrary ( nondiscrete ) groups of translations @xmath15 , or , at least countable ones .",
    "the strategy for proving theorem [ main ] is the same as in tits free construction of rank 2 spherical buildings , see @xcite , i.e. , we run a _ `` ponzi - scheme '' _ :    we inductively construct a sequence of cat(0 ) spaces @xmath16 where each @xmath17 is _ finite _",
