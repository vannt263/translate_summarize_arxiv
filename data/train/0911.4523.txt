    "the billiards problem leads to both classical and quantum hamiltonian systems such as the well known stadium @xcite and sinai billiards @xcite .",
    "a question of great interest in open billiards , such as those composed of quantum dots and quantum wires , is that concerned with the influence of the boundary shape on the transport properties of this systems @xcite .",
    "the study of chaos by means of classical transport properties is of much interest recently .",
    "so , some classical transport properties have been analyzed in open channels with different boundaries @xcite .",
    "for example a criterion was proposed to distinguish between regular and chaotic dynamics by measuring the classical resistance in a two - dimensional channel composed of two boundaries being one sinusoidal ( rippled ) and the other a flat .",

    "some preliminary experimental results concerned with semiplane channel has been published recently @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in order to get a high reflectivity is necessary to have a big number of trapped particles    in this paper we analyze the effects of the boundaries on the properties of classical ballistic transport for a two - dimensional channel composed of two sinusoidal boundary walls as shown in fig .",

    "our main objective in this work is to analyze how the relative phase and amplitude of the ripple of the walls affect the transport properties of the channel and the possible applications to waveguides .",
    "an interesting feature of our system is that it has a high reflectivity , compared with the obtained using the semiplane channel .",
    "a brief outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ channel ]",
    "we describe the geometry of the channel and give the corresponding map . in section [ poinca ]",
    "we present a study of dynamics of the system by means of the poincar sections .",
    "section [ properties ] is devoted to obtain analytical expressions for the resistivity when amplitudes of the ripples are small . in section",

    "let us consider an open channel with rippled walls ( see fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the profiles of the upper and lower walls are determined respectively by @xmath0 where we use the dimensionless variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the length of one period , @xmath7 is the length of the channel , @xmath8 is the amplitude of the ripple and @xmath9 is a half of the average width of the channel .",
    "the variable @xmath10 denotes the phase difference between the upper and lower walls . as a consequence of the periodicity of boundaries of the channel , @xmath10",
    "is restricted to values @xmath11 .",
    "we are interested in determining the evolution of @xmath12 particles injected on the left side of this channel .",
    "the particles are dropped by @xmath13 sources uniformly distributed along the @xmath14 axis located at @xmath15 .",
    "each source drops @xmath16 particles with an angular distribution given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance between the walls at the @xmath19-point .",
    "we assume that the collisions of the particles with the boundaries are specular .      in order to find the poincar sections corresponding to channels characterized by certain parameters it is necessary to have a discrete map . since the parameters we shall be using in the next section are such that multiple collisions of the particles with the ripple are improbable .",
    "according to our numerical study the occurrence of multiple collisions , for each trajectory is @xmath20 , therefore we may neglect them .    to construct the map",
    "let us consider a set of discrete points @xmath21 of each particle initially dropped with initial conditions @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the position in the @xmath19 direction at the @xmath24-th collision of the particle with the upper wall and @xmath25 is the angle that the trajectory of particle makes with @xmath19-axis just after the @xmath24-th collision .",
    "the resulting map is @xmath26 from the second line of last equation we see that to express the position of the @xmath27-th collision as @xmath28 , the equation must be solved numerically .",
    "the variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by ( see fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] ( b ) ) : @xmath33 here @xmath32 stands for position of the particle in the @xmath19-direction just after the @xmath24-th collision with the lower wall , @xmath29 is the angle that the trajectory of the particle makes with @xmath19-axis after the @xmath24-th collision with the lower wall .",
    "finally , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) represents the slope of the line tangent to the lower wall at the point @xmath36 ( the upper wall at @xmath37 ) .",
    "we want to indicate for future comparison , that our channel ( for @xmath38 ) has the same transmitivity as the semiplane channel with an average width equals to @xmath39 and the same ripple amplitude . in order to see this ,",
    "let us consider a particle propagating inside the semiplane channel and other one propagating inside our channel .",
    "the trajectory of the particle moving in the semiplane channel defines a succession of collision points ( @xmath40 ) with the upper wall . on the other hand",
    ", a particle propagating in our channel , with @xmath38 defines a set of collision points with the upper wall ( @xmath41 ) . because of the specular symmetry respect to the @xmath19 axis in our channel , the following condition is satisfied @xmath42    if the particles in both channels are dropped with the same initial conditions and the first bounce occurs with the upper wall (",
    "if the first bounce is with the lower wall a similar relation is obtained ) then it is obtained the same transmitivity in both cases .",
    "to plot the poincar sections we choose for convenience the conjugate pair ( @xmath23,@xmath43 ) , where @xmath44 ( see the map in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) ) is the momentum in the @xmath19 direction right after the @xmath24-th collision with the upper wall . in order to have access to all possible orbits with our initial conditions we varied the position of the sources at the @xmath19",
    "for instance , to reach orbits within the islands we placed the sources at the @xmath19 coordinate of the corresponding fixed point .",
    "notice that we implicitly take a channel of infinite length .    for obtaining the poincar plots we set the value @xmath45 and accordingly we have a narrow channel with @xmath46 and a wide channel with @xmath47 .",
    "to represent the poincar plots , we use the @xmath19-interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we will see that the dynamics of these two channels are quite different . to solve the map in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) we use a bisection method applied to @xmath49 small intervals along the channel .",
    "the numerical code was written in fortran and the calculations were carried out in a pc with a pentium iv processor .",
    "for the narrow channel with small ripple amplitudes ( e.g @xmath50 ) , the system shows a regular dynamics ; the corresponding poincar plots resemble the phase space of a one dimensional pendulum ( see figs .",
    "[ lnc1](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this means that the elliptic orbits ( an elliptic orbit is an special case of a closed trajectory in the phase space called librational motion @xcite ) correspond to trapped particles in the channel , moving backward and forward around a stable fixed point .",
    "+   +    the trajectories outside these elliptic orbits represent particles traveling to the left ( @xmath51 ) or to the right ( @xmath52 ) of the channel and they never return .",
    "we can also see that the position of the fixed points and the size of the region of librational motion depend on the relative phase @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath53 the elliptic orbits can not be observed ( see fig .",
    "[ lnc1 ] ( c ) ) . for other cases",
    "the size of the elliptic orbits are clearly remarked . in our case",
    "fixed points represent particles bouncing between the same point ( @xmath54,@xmath55 ) of the upper wall and the point ( @xmath56,@xmath57 ) of the lower wall .",
    "the position of fixed points @xmath58 can be obtained by considering geometrical arguments ( see [ appen ] ) .",
    "if we increment @xmath59 ( still for a narrow channel ) in some interval ( e.g. for the values @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , the dynamics of the system is still regular and the arising librational orbits occupy a larger region .",
    "this means that there are more librational orbits accessible to the initial conditions increasing the number of reflected particles in the channel . in the case of @xmath53 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the elliptical orbits can now be observed .",
    "if we increase @xmath59 again , the elliptical orbits start to deform , occupying a larger region and the separatrix becomes chaotic with some sizable width ( see fig .",
    "[ lnc1](d ) ) , this means that more particles can get into the region and they may be reflected .",
    "the accessible chaotic region outside the separatrix can not contribute to the reflection because there are some kam curves that forbid its connection with the separatrix ( see figs .",
    "[ lnc2 ] ( a ) and [ lnc1 ] ( d ) ) . axis ( see fig .",
    "[ lnc2 ] ( b ) ) . in the case of the semiplane channel",
    "the trajectory of the particle in the phase space must cross the @xmath19 axis to have some reflection .",
    "hence , it could be thought that there can be reflection of particles without crossing the kam curves , but this does not occur because the poincar plots formed with the lower wall as a poicar plane have similar barriers . ] nevertheless , there is a critical amplitude @xmath63 that depends on @xmath10 , for which these kam curves break allowing the connection of all chaotic regions and then they can contribute to the reflection ( see figs [ lnc2 ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "for instance for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , for @xmath38 , @xmath66 and for @xmath53 , @xmath67 . we observe a principal first - order resonant island surrounded by a chaotic     +   +    sea , and also a second order resonant islands chain surrounding the first order islands . in fig .",
    "[ lnc2 ] ( c ) these islands are produced by particles bouncing in the neighborhood of a stable fixed point of period five .",
    "if we increase the value of @xmath63 , more initial conditions get into the chaotic sea due to destruction of regular curves .",
    "notice that the rate at which the kam curves are destroyed as the amplitude is increased depends on @xmath10 : if we are near to @xmath53 this process is slow and if we are near to @xmath68 this process is fast . in the case of the wide channel , we can see , in contrast to narrow channel , that poincar plots for the wide channel show a rather chaotic behaviour , even for small amplitudes ( see fig . [ wnc1 ] ( a ) ) , but there are some small regions of librational motion .",
    "if the amplitude is increased there exists a critical amplitude for which all kam curves are destroyed and it produces a global chaos ( see fig [ wnc1 ] ( b ) ) . in previous works @xcite it has also been observed that the case of global chaos is generally meaningless for applications in waveguides . due to this behaviour",
    "we leave aside the discussion about this type of channel .",
    "the transmitivity , @xmath69 , is the flux of transmitted particles divided by the incoming flux , as usual the reflectivity is @xmath70 . for our system",
    "it is not possible to have analytical expressions for these quantities .",
    "however in some limiting cases we can determine them . in what follows",
    "we shall be using a finite channel of length @xmath71 .",
    "if we consider a narrow channel ( @xmath72 ) with small amplitudes ( @xmath73 ) and assume that the ripples are smooth ( @xmath74 ) , it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for reflectivity . in this channel",
    ", the particles dropped near to the @xmath14-direction could contribute to reflectivity . in order to obtain an expression for the reflectivity ,",
    "let us first consider two consecutive collisions , for which the particles collide almost perpendicularly with the walls . under this assumption",
    "we have the following @xmath75 in fact , according to fig.[figu1 ] ( b ) and eq .",
    "( [ angles ] ) the relation @xmath76 is fulfilled . for angles such that @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , considering the @xmath79 , taking into account an expansion in taylor series and keeping terms up to second order in ( [ deltaj ] ) we obtain @xmath80 this equation allows us to corroborate eq .",
    "( [ deltaj ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath81 is satisfied trivially for the case of plane walls .",

    "initial conditions reach accessible elliptic orbits , colliding almost perpendicularly with the walls . for this particles the variables",

    "there are two critical angles @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for which the particle does not return .",
    "these angles correspond to particles dropped with positive and negative angles , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively ( see fig.[figu1 ] ( a ) ) .",
