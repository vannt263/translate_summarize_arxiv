    "extensive radio surveys of the sky began in the 1950s when the number of identified sources was not sufficient to conduct significant statistical studies .",
    "the large - area continuum radio surveys have become the foundation for all other radio astronomy tests since they provide the necessary radio source catalogues and the location of objects with which astronomers can calibrate their instruments .",
    "the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey of the southern sky was undertaken as a collaboration between the parkes radio observatory of the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) , the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) , and the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) @xcite .",
    "the primary aim of the project was to survey the whole southern sky at a frequency of 4850 mhz in order to provide a more extensive , high - quality catalogue of radio sources for the southern hemisphere .",
    "the secondary aim was to use this survey to complement the results obtained from the northern hemisphere 4850 mhz survey performed by @xcite which was made using the nrao 91 m telescope @xcite .",
    "previously , the only large - area , high - frequency radio survey in the same area was the 2700 mhz survey of bolton and his collaborators which contains around 8200 sources @xcite .    the southern survey @xmath1 and the tropical survey @xmath2 increased the number of known radio sources in the southern and tropical zones by a factor of about 5 over those known previously from the parkes 2700 mhz and molonglo 408 mhz surveys @xcite .",
    "the catalogue of radio sources discovered in the southern survey contains 23,277 sources .",
    "however , it is important to realise that the pmn surveys primarily detected point sources and the reduction process was optimised for such objects .",
    "this resulted in the exclusion of many extended objects from the survey with the exception of stronger sources which had a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "it was from an image of the pmn survey that the chosen object of study was discovered .",
    "the object is at right ascension @xmath3 and declination @xmath4 ( galactic longitude @xmath5 and latitude @xmath6 ) and has an approximate diameter of @xmath0 .",
    "the object is shown towards the centre of figure  1 which is a map taken from the pmn survey .",
    "the circular appearance of the object suggests it may be a supernova remnant ( snr ) although it does not currently appear in snr catalogues .",
    "the source has also been noted as a snr candidate by @xcite .",
    "the object seems to have no optically visible counterpart and no counterpart has been found in current rosat data . shown in figure 2",
    "is an iras 12 micron image from the same region of sky as the object @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the object may have a strong counterpart in the infra - red , although dust in the local environment makes further conclusions based on the ir data difficult .",
    "the extended source was observed in january , 1995 using the mosaic capabilities of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the observation used a 19 pointing centre mosaic in a hexagonal grid with the pointing centres set @xmath7 apart from each other .",
    "the radio sources 1934 - 638 and 0823 - 500 were used as the primary calibrators and 1549 - 790 was used as the secondary calibrator .",
    "the object was observed at frequencies of 1380 mhz and 2378 mhz which , along with a baseline of 375 m , were chosen to approximately match the resolution of the pmn survey at 4850 mhz .",
    "each band had a width of 128 mhz divided into 32 channels .",
    "the allocated observing time began at 10:30 ut , january 17 and extended through to 2:30 ut , january 18 and allowed an approximate 12 hour synthesis observation of the source .",
    "the observations are summarised in table 1 .",
    ".atca observations of g312.5 - 3.0 [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the response of the atca interferometer to the shortest spatial frequencies is different from that of the parkes and molonglo radio telescopes . hence , it is difficult to make a direct comparison of the total flux densities .      synchrotron radiation from electrons in a uniform magnetic field is highly directional and so should be linearly polarised @xcite . ideally , the orientation of the magnetic field may be determined from the polarisation position angle .",
    "this assumes that the magnetic field is an ordered field in a vacuum .",
    "relatively young snrs are known to have quite large depolarisation effects due to disorder in the magnetic field in the source itself @xcite .",
    "polarisation images of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 stokes parameters were obtained which showed that there is no significant polarisation in the extended source .",
    "this lack of polarisation is confirmed by @xcite , who reports no apparent polarisation at 2.4 ghz .",
    "distances to snrs can occasionally be obtained indirectly either from measuring optical velocities and proper motions or from positional coincidences with h i and h ii regions , ob associations , or pulsars .",
    "however , the simple ( but disputed ) method of using the radio surface brightness - to - diameter relationship @xmath10 @xcite is adopted here to obtain a distance estimate for the observed source , assuming that it is a snr .",
    "the radio surface brightness is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is in janskys and @xmath13 is in arcminutes .",
    "the @xmath14 relation for galactic shell remnants derived by @xcite is given by @xmath15 where the diameter @xmath16 is in parsecs .",
    "the distance follows directly .    in the case of the observed object , the flux density @xmath12 at 1 ghz",
    "was estimated ( assuming the spectrum shown in figure 6 peaks before 1 ghz ) to be @xmath17 jy . from equation",
    "( 2 ) , the radio surface brightness was estimated to be @xmath18 .",
    "the diameter of the object was then estimated from equation ( 3 ) to be @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the distance to the source of @xmath20 .",
    "the uncertainty in these calculations are subject to the errors inherent in the assumptions with the @xmath21 relation .",
    "these are the assumptions that all shell remnants have the same radio luminosity dependence on linear diameter , have the same supernova explosion mechanism and energy , and are evolving into identical environments @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded by @xcite that the @xmath21 relation is severely limited and that the distance determinations may have a factor of 3 error .",
    "however , by using known distances to snrs as distance `` calibrators '' , @xcite find the error in their derived @xmath21 relation to be @xmath22 .",
    "mosaic observations of an extended source from the pmn survey were carried out using the atca in early 1995 at frequencies of 1380 mhz and 2378  mhz . to complement these data , further observations of the source",
    "were obtained from the most at a frequency 843  mhz .",
    "the morphology of the extended object shows a distinct shell structure which is optically thin .",
    "this is common to both snrs and planetary nebulae . in the case of a snr",
    ", a shell structure would indicate that the remnant was possibly produced by a type i supernova resulting from the collapse of a white dwarf star .",
    "interactions with the interstellar medium may have produced variations in the spherical nature of the remnant s structure .",
    "if the source is a snr , the lack of significant polarisation suggests that the intervening magnetic fields are disordered or that the snr candidate is at a large distance .",
    "an estimate of the source s distance was made using the @xmath21 relation for galactic shell remnants .",
    "this yielded a diameter of @xmath23 and a distance of @xmath24 .",
    "these results are consistent with the known parameters of snrs and that the apparent lack of linear polarisation is likely due to the large distance .",
    "the distance estimate is of course dependant on the source being a snr .    since interferometers do not respond to the shortest spatial frequencies , it is difficult to compare total flux densities from atca observations with those from the parkes radio telescope .",
    "the 1.38 ghz and 2.38 ghz results may be improved by using the parkes telescope which contains the lower spacings .",
    "additional spectral information may be obtained from further observations using the atca and the parkes telescope at x - band ( 80009200 mhz ) .",
    "it would also be useful to obtain x - ray spectra of the source to gain an estimate of the shock velocity and thus determine the age and expansion rate of the snr candidate .",
    "the authors would like to thank robert sault for providing assistance with the data reduction in miriad and anne green for her help in the acquiring and reduction of the molonglo radio map and for her useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "thanks also are due to simon ellingsen and richard dodson for their useful comments .",
