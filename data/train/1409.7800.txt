    "recently , kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( k-122 ) has attracted special attention due to several unusual physical properties such as a very large quasiparticle effective mass @xcite and superconductivity ( sc ) with nodes in the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "such a large mass enhancement is usually ascribed to the presence of pronounced correlation effects . however , in the present case the nature and the strength of these correlation effects as well as the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter are still under debate .",
    "some experiments were interpreted in favor of @xmath7 -wave sc with accidental nodes @xcite whereas other favor @xmath8- wave sc @xcite . based on their theoretical calculations the authors of ref",
    ".   argue that the electronic correlations are enhanced in the strongly hole - overdoped k-122 as compared to lower hole doping levels in other 122 systems due to the changes in the fermi - surface topology .",
    "this might affect the low - energy spin excitation spectra and cause an increasing density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy @xmath9 .",
    "however , this calculation underestimates the correlation effect found experimentally .",
    "recently , it was proposed that the unexpected large effective mass enhancement of the order of 9 to 10 could be related to the proximity of an orbital - selective mott transition for k-122 @xcite .",
    "the relation between the enhanced correlation effects and the sc remains still unclear .",
    "therefore , tuning of the physical properties of k-122 by external or chemical pressure and disorder can provide more insight into the pairing symmetry and the present correlation effects .",
    "recently , several studies of the physical properties of k-122 @xcite and its sister compounds cs-122 @xcite , and rb-122 @xcite under external pressure have been reported .",
    "tafti _ et al .",
    "_ observed that the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 of k-122 at first monotonically decreases with increasing hydrostatic pressure , then reaches a minimum at @xmath10 1.7 gpa ( we adopt from ref . referring @xmath11 gpa as critical pressure ) , and finally shows a reversal behavior @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical pressure is nearly independent of the amount of the disorder in k-122 but it is reduced in the unsubstituted clean cs-122 @xcite .",
    "however , v.  taufour _ et al .",
    "_ , showed that the pressure dependence of @xmath0 for k-122 is sensitive to the pressure medium @xcite , and that for the best pressure ( hydrostatic ) conditions the reversal behavior of @xmath0 is replaced by a broad minimum followed by a nearly pressure independent @xmath0 value above 2.5  gpa . from the almost pressure independent behavior of the hall coefficient extrapolated to @xmath12",
    "= 0 as well as from the residual resistivity , it was concluded that the topology of the fermi surface does not change across the critical pressure.@xcite this point of view was , also , supported by recent de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) measurements under pressure , where at least two small but accessible fermi surface sheets ( fss ) , namely the smallest cylinder @xmath13 around the @xmath14-point and the propeller blade - like fss @xmath15 around the x point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , do not show a lifshitz transition up to 2.47  gpa.@xcite the evolution of the fermi surface is accompanied by a reduction of the effective quasi - particle masses without any special feature at the critical pressure .",
    "the reduction of the effective masses and the decrease of @xmath0 up to the pressure about 2  gpa can be qualitatively explained by a reduction of coupling constants . in order to explain the @xmath0 minimum it was supposed that at the critical pressure a change of the superconducting gap symmetry from @xmath8- wave to @xmath7- wave @xcite or from nodal @xmath7 -wave to a nodeless one @xcite should occur .",
    "the fast increase of the inelastic scattering rate at the critical pressure obtained from the transport measurements supports such a hypothesis.@xcite alternatively , v.  taufour _ et al . _",
    "proposed that a change of symmetry under pressure may not occur at all.@xcite these authors empirically supposed that the critical pressure could be a consequence of anisotropic pressure derivatives , since the pressure derivatives along the @xmath16 axis and the @xmath17 axis are negative and positive , respectively . in this case",
    ", the critical pressure corresponds to the critical pressure in the @xmath18 plane above which the slope of @xmath19 depends on the value of @xmath20 , only , whereas @xmath21 for @xmath22  gpa .",
    "these authors have also shown quantitatively that the behavior of the upper critical fields in crossing the critical pressure can be accounted for by @xmath23 modulations of the superconducting gap , only .",
    "the amount and type of disorder provide additional possibilities to tune the superconducting properties .",
    "recently , the effect of na substitution on the superconducting and the normal - state properties of k-122 was investigated.@xcite it was shown that the temperature dependence of the specific heat of k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 single crystals can be explained by multiband @xmath8-wave sc . the disorder induced by the na substitution suppresses the small superconducting gaps and leads to gapless sc with a large residual dos .",
    "the specific heat jump scales approximately with a power - law , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 determined by the impurity scattering rate , in contrast to most iron - pnictide superconductors described by the remarkable budko - ni - canfield ( bnc ) scaling @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite however , the na substitution might also produce chemical pressure which could additionally affect @xmath0 .    in this work ,",
    "we show that a partial na substitution produces non - hydrostatic chemical pressure with a larger compression along the @xmath17 axis .",
    "thereby the netto ( total ) effect of the chemical pressure on @xmath0 is strongly reduced due to anisotropic pressure derivatives with different signs along the @xmath17 and @xmath16(@xmath27 ) axis",
    ". therefore , the pressure dependence of @xmath6 ( without pair - breaking ) and the corresponding coupling constant are nearly independent of the na substitution .",
    "furthermore , we present a theoretical analysis of the band structure of kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 under pressure within the first - principles density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the calculations indicate that the minimum in the pressure dependence of @xmath0 can be qualitatively explained by a relatively small non - monotonic variation of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "in general , our results suggests that the superconductivity in k-122 is driven by a single leading band . +",
    "k@xmath1na@xmath5fe@xmath28as@xmath28 single crystals with a typical mass of about 1 - 2  mg and several mm in - plane dimensions were grown by the self - flux method .",

    "the two stoichiometric kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 samples were prepared using different fluxes : s1 from a feas flux and s2 from a kas one , for details see refs .",
    "@xcite . additionally , we performed single crystal diffraction measurements at room temperature and at @xmath12 = 100 k. the crystallographic parameters were extracted from single crystal diffraction data .",

    "@xmath30-scans were recorded with an increment of 0.3 , integration and corrections for oblique incidence and polarization were performed within saint @xcite .",

    "single crystal x - ray diffraction analysis at @xmath12 = 100 k was carried out with an ipds ( stoe ) diffractometer using graphite monochromated mo - k@xmath13 radiation .",
    "numerical absorption corrections were applied for both data sets with transmission coefficients of @xmath31 = 0.0077/0.3052 and 0.0495/0.06333 , respectively .",
    "the structures were solved and anisotropically refined with the shelx program package.@xcite the relative na / k contents were included into the refinements as an independent parameter ( x ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was measured by the standard four - contact method in the quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the temperature dependent , zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) magnetization under pressure was measured in a quantum design mpms - squid magnetometer down to 1.8  k in a magnetic field of 10 oe . the samples position was not perfectly fixed during the magnetization measurements under pressure . therefore , in some cases samples could be tilted with respect to the applied field direction after the application of the pressure .",
    "this affects the amplitude of the superconducting diamagnetic signal ( due to a variation in the demagnetization factor ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mag_all ] . however , the defined @xmath0 values are not affected considerably , since the measurements were performed at low applied magnetic field as compared to the critical fields of the investigated samples .    for the dc magnetization measurement under pressure",
    ", we used a commercial pressure cell easylab mcell 10 tailored for a mpms of quantum design for the pressure measurements up to 1  gpa and a homemade pressure cell ( hpc ) for the pressure measurements up to 3  gpa .",
    "the hpc has been constructed for a commercial mpms .",
    "its cell design is mostly related to a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) , in which two opposing cone - shaped ceramic anvils compress a gasket that serves as the sample chamber.@xcite a supplied uniaxial pressure will be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure by using daphne7373 oil as transmitting medium .",
    "the cell can be equipped with different types of sample chambers , for which the sample space varied between either 0.7 mm in diameter and 0.4 mm in depth , or on the other hand 0.3 mm in diameter and 0.2 mm in depth . using these different chambers a maximum hydrostatic pressure up to 3  gpa and 6  gpa",
    "can be generated , respectively .",
    "each mechanical part of the pressure cell , except for the anvils , is made from a very low - magnetic cube alloy , which allows measurements at a weak background signal of the cell itself .",
    "@xcite additionally , the magnetization data have been corrected for the contribution of the background signal by subtracting the extrapolated ( below @xmath0 ) background signal obtained at @xmath32 .",
    "the pressure was determined at low temperatures using superconducting sn in case of the quantum design pressure cell and pb in case of the homemade cell as a low - temperature pressure gauge .",
    "for most of the measurements the pressure dependence of @xmath0 was linear up to 1.5 gpa ( see fig . [ tc_p ] ) .",
    "however , using the easylab mcell 10 pressure cell in some cases we observed deviations from a linear @xmath19 dependence at pressures below 0.1  gpa .",
    "to verify the origin of this behavior at low pressures , we performed additional measurements in a he - gas cube pressure cell up to the maximum pressure of 0.5  gpa . in the experiment a cube cell connected to a he - gas compressor was used for finite @xmath33 measurements .",
    "@xcite an in sample was used for an in - situ determination of the pressure .",

    "@xcite the susceptibility data have been corrected for the contribution of the sample holder , including the pressure cell , which was determined independently . in the case of the experiments with he as a pressure medium the non - linear behavior in the @xmath19 dependence at low pressures was not observed .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the observed deviation from the linear @xmath19 dependence is related to deviation from the hydrostatic conditions . in this work ,",

    "can be observed.@xcite in contrast , for k , na-122 single crystals we observed a monotonic increase of the residual electronic specific heat @xmath101 with na substitution and a nearly na independent @xmath4 behavior of @xmath102 at low - temperature .",
    "@xcite therefore , our data are consistent with a symmetry protected @xmath8-wave sc in these compounds which is stable at least up to the pressure where @xmath0 has a minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ tc_p]b ) .",
    "finally , we compare the calculated fermi surface cross sections with the experimental ones obtained from dhva measurements @xcite .",
    "these dhva experiments show , that the size of the lobes near the x - point decreases with pressure and that of the @xmath13 cylinder weakly increases up to 2.47  gpa , the maximum pressure reached experimentally .",
    "the trend in the calculated fermi surface cross sections for this pressure range , i.e ,  up to 2.5  gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ fs_exp ] ) is consistent with the corresponding dhva frequencies .",
    "however , increasing the pressure above 2.5  gpa , e.g.  in the case of 3  gpa shown in fig .",
    "[ fs_exp](d ) , the size of the lobes maintain their dimension .",
    "thus , this prediction could be verified experimentally by studies around this pressure .    for this purpose , in tab .",
    "[ tab:4 ] we collected the calculated cross section of various fs bands , dhva frequencies and the @xmath103 ratios as found in the literature from both measurements and simulations . together with them , we add our gga results calculated for the experimental crystal structure .",
    "the dhva frequencies and the @xmath103-ratio have been estimated calculating the extremal fs areas and the relative orbit frequencies using its implementation in the skeaf code@xcite .",
    "the gga calculated fs cross sections are in qualitative agreement with respect to the experiments ( except @xmath15 fs ) .",
    "however , the theoretical @xmath103 ratios essentially underestimate experimental values pointing to sizable correlation effects in accord with a previous study . in this context",
    "we note that the observed large difference of the effective resistivity coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 discussed above ( see tab.[tab:2 ] ) , is likely to be caused by the high - energy mass renormalizations and not related directly to the pairing interactions .",
    "this suggestion is also consistent with the significant pressure dependence of the approximate effective single @xmath104 coefficient reported by v.  taufour _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we extended the study to high pressure and we report the results of calculated dhva frequencies and we compared them with experimental measurements.@xcite the results obtained in the calculations are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab:5 ] for the fs s shown in fig .",
    "[ fs_exp ] .",
    "we observed that the largest dhva frequency increases for the @xmath13-band as a function of the pressure , in agreement with experiment.@xcite at the same time , the lowest frequency slightly decreases with pressure overestimating the increase of the three dimensionality of the electronic structure under pressure as compared to experiment.@xcite    we confirm , moreover , the absence of a lifshitz transition under pressure .",
    "@xcite note , that the variation of the tdos at the fermi level in the pressure range up to 3 gpa is below 15% as shown in fig .",
    "such a relatively small variation of the tdos for multiband systems can be hardly distinguished in experiments such as transport measurements .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the observation of a nearly pressure independent hall coefficient and residual resistivity @xcite can not exclude such relatively small variations of the dos . +",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the effect of hydrostatic pressure and na substitution on the superconducting and the normal - state properties of kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "we have found that the na substitution noticeably affects the lattice parameters which can be considered as a non - hydrostatic chemical pressure .",
    "however , the comparison of the external hydrostatic pressure with the chemical pressure shows that the total effect of the structural changes on @xmath0 due to na substitution is rather weak .",
    "therefore , the main mechanism of the @xmath0 suppression in na doped crystals is a weak pair - breaking effect caused by disorder .",
    "the na substitution enhances the residual resistivity and leads to a formal non - fermi liquid behavior in the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "we have shown that this deviation from the @xmath4 behavior can be described by multiband effects due to different effective quasi - particle masses for different bands .",
    "the pressure dependencies of @xmath0 for the k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 system can be described by the single - band abrikosov - gorkov - type scaling curve using the na independent critical temperature in a clean limit @xmath6(p ) .",
    "these observations additionally confirm that the @xmath0 suppression for na substitution is mainly caused by the pair - breaking effect .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath0 for csfe@xmath3as@xmath3 can be also scaled on the same curve , however , with a different @xmath6(p ) .",
    "these results suggest the same pairing symmetry for this compound as for the k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 system . additionally , we performed theoretical investigations of the band structure of kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 under pressure within the generalized gradient approximation .",
    "our results suggest , that the observed pressure dependence of @xmath0 can be explained by the non - monotonic variation of the pdos of the @xmath105 derived band under pressure without a change of the pairing symmetry .",
    "this @xmath105 derived band is supposed to be most relevant for the superconductivity of the k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 system .",

    "<S> the effect of hydrostatic pressure and partial na substitution on the normal - state properties and the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) of k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 single crystals were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that a partial na substitution leads to a deviation from the standard @xmath4 fermi - liquid behavior in the temperature dependence of the normal - state resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that non - fermi liquid like behavior of the resistivity for k@xmath1na@xmath5fe@xmath3as@xmath3 and some kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 samples can be explained by disorder effect in the multiband system with rather different quasiparticle effective masses . concerning the superconducting state our data support the presence of a shallow minimum around 2 gpa in the pressure dependence of @xmath0 for stoichiometric kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xmath0 in the k@xmath1na@xmath5fe@xmath3as@xmath3 at pressures below 1.5 gpa showed , that the reduction of @xmath0 with na substitution follows the abrikosov - gorkov law with the critical temperature @xmath6 of the clean system ( without pair - breaking ) which linearly depends on the pressure . our observations , also , suggest that @xmath0 of k@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 is nearly independent of the lattice compression produced by the na substitution . </S>",
    "<S> further , we theoretically analyzed the behavior of the band structure under pressure within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative agreement between the calculated and the recently in de haas - van alphen experiments @xcite measured pressure dependencies of the fermi - surface cross - sections has been found . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations , also , indicate that the observed minimum around 2  gpa in the pressure dependence of @xmath0 may occur without a change of the pairing symmetry . </S>"
