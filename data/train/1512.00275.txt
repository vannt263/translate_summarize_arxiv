    "the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mit ) caused by electron - electron interaction is one of the central issues in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "a variety of many - body methods such as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) have been developed to study the transitions in models and realistic materials .",
    "till now , most of the model studies on mit are focused on the single band hubbard model , which has been viewed as the  hydrogen atom \" for mit . however , in most of the realistic materials , the transition should be described by multi - band hubbard models and the transition is greatly influenced by the fluctuation of electrons among different orbitals , which is absent in the simple single band model . as a consequence , the physics of mit in multi - band systems is much richer with many exotic phenomena occurring , i.e. the orbital - selective mott transition ( osmt ) .    the osmt is first introduced to explain the complicated behavior of conduction electrons in ca@xmath2sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 , where at least part of the conduction electrons are itinerant while the rest seem to be localized . since then , a lot of model studies have been carried out to uncover the mechanism of osmt .",
    "firstly , a two - band hubbard model with different band width at half - filling has been investigated by different groups . in this case , electrons are equally distributed within the two bands . with the increment of coulomb interaction @xmath5 ,",
    "two different bands undergo mit separately .",
    "the band with narrower band width becomes mott insulator first due to its stronger correlation strength while the one with wider band width still remains metallic , indicating an osmt .",
    "those studies also confirm that the hund s coupling , both the ising - type ( only @xmath6 is considered ) and the rotational invariant type ( including spin - flip @xmath7 and pair - hopping @xmath8 terms ) , plays a very important role in osmt .",
    "secondly , osmt can exist in a three - band hubbard model with equal band width in the presence of crystal field splitting ( cfs ) at integer filling 2 , 3 , or 4 .",
    "the average filling of four electrons per site was studied in detail by demedici _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite . in their model , one orbital",
    "is lifted by the cfs , while the other two orbitals keep degenerate .",
    "they find a large orbital - selective mott phase ( osmp ) region in the phase diagram and large hund s coupling can enlarge the osmp region as a  band decoupler \" .",
    "the case of two electrons per site in a three - band hubbard model has been studied by kita _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite and they find an osmt region in the phase diagram at large hund s coupling .",
    "thirdly , doping - driven osmt has also been studied by some groups . in the case of two - band hubbard model with different band width , osmt can still be stable away from half - filling in certain parameters region .",
    "have considered a two - band hubbard model with equal band width split by crystal field .",
    "they find that , in the presence of cfs , doping would first drive one of the bands into metallic phase while leaving the other one in a mott phase , thus inducing the osmt .",
    "further doping would drive the other band into metallic phase . in this case , the underlying physics to drive an osmt is doping .",
    "however , the physics behind such a doping - induced osmt with equal band width has not been studied in detail yet , which inspires the current study .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the detailed physical aspects of doping - driven osmt .",
    "we consider a multi - band hubbard model with equal band width , in which the cfs lifts one of the bands to higher energy ( upper band ) and leaves the other bands ( lower bands ) to be degenerate . through the dmft calculations",
    ", we will show that in such a system we can find a doping - induced osmt , which is very surprising because usually doping electrons will turn the mott phase into the metallic phase or the opposite .",
    "we start from the situation where the lower bands are half - filled and the upper band is forced to be empty by adjusting the cfs .",
    "suppose that at the beginning the system is near the critical point of mit but still in the metallic side .",
    "then , we start to dope electrons into the upper band but still keep the lower bands half - filled by tuning the cfs properly .",
    "we find that there will be a critical doping point , after which the lower half - filled bands will be driven into a mott phase while the upper band still keeps metallic phase within a considerable region of the cfs .",
    "we also find that further increasing doping concentration will enlarge the osmp region .",
    "finally , we reach the critical doping concentration at which both the upper and the lower bands are half - filled , and the osmp merges into a single mott phase . therefore , we realize a doping - driven osmt in multi - band systems in the presence of cfs .",
    "the systems described above can be realized by both two - band and three - band hubbard models . in this paper ,",
    "both models are studied in detail by the dmft method combined with the high precision hybridization expansion continuous time quantum monte carlo ( hyb - ctqmc ) impurity solver .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of total electron filling @xmath0 and cfs @xmath1 are calculated .",
    "based on the results , we summarize this mechanism of osmt as : ( 1 ) with strong hund s coupling , doping electrons to a multi - band system with special cfs will help to form and stabilize the local magnetic moment ; ( 2 ) large local magnetic moment will scatter electrons strongly and enhance the effective correlation strength , which will cause a mott transition in some certain bands , thus leading to an osmt .",
    "we consider the following multi - band hubbard model defined as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the site index , @xmath11 is the spin index , @xmath12 is the orbital index and @xmath13 is the electron density operator . here , @xmath14 is the strength of the nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath15 is the chemical potential , and @xmath16 is the energy level for orbital @xmath17 . in the coulomb interaction terms , @xmath18 is the intra - orbital ( inter - orbital ) coulomb interaction , and @xmath19 is the hund s coupling .",
    "the constrained condition @xmath20 is imposed as usual . in the present paper , we consider both the ising - type ( only @xmath21 term ) and the rotational invariant ( including @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms ) hund s coupling .",
    "however , our results show that the physical pictures are almost the same in both cases , so we will mainly discuss the results of the ising - type case for simplicity .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath15 is adjusted dynamically in the calculations to reach the expected total electron filling per site during doping .",
    "the cfs is defined as @xmath24 for two - band case and @xmath25 for three - band case , respectively .",
    "we can solve this lattice model defined in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : model ] in the framework of single - site dmft , which neglects the momentum dependence of the self - energy and maps the lattice model into an effective impurity model being solved self - consistently .",
    "we use a semicircular density of states , @xmath26 , which corresponds to the infinite - coordination bethe lattice , where @xmath27 is the half band width and all bands keep equal band width . to solve the effective impurity problem",
    ", we use the hyb - ctqmc impurity solver implemented in the @xmath28qist package , which allows us to access the strong interaction regime down to very low temperature .",
    "the temperature is set to be @xmath29 ( corresponding to the inverse temperature @xmath30 ) through all our calculations . in each dmft iteration , we have typically performed @xmath31 qmc samplings to reach sufficient numerical accuracy .",

    "[ fig : occu ] .",
    "we take @xmath44 for example . initially , in the absence of the cfs , the electrons distribute equally within the two orbitals .",
    "if we continuously increase @xmath1 , the electrons will gradually populate into the lower orbital until it is half - filled ( indicated by the left blue arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : occu ] ) .",
    "after that , further increasing the cfs will not populate more electrons into the lower orbital because it will pay a higher energy cost due to the strong coulomb interaction among the electrons in the lower orbital . as a result ,",
    "the system may come into a state , in which the lower orbital always keeps half - filling ( the plateau between the blue arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : occu ] ) in a considerable region of the cfs .",
    "we also find that this plateau will reach earlier at large doping ( see @xmath45 for example , plateau indicated by the green arrows ) .",
    "on the contrary , for very small doping ( for example @xmath46 ) , we can not see obvious plateau .",
    "therefore , the plateau becomes wider when doping is larger .",
    "however , if the cfs is large enough ( comparable with @xmath5 ) , the electrons will again populate into the lower orbital to avoid the cost of the large cfs energy .     for three selected total electron filling @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "@xmath52 are for upper orbital , lower orbital and total contributions , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]        based on the knowledge about the redistribution of electrons discussed above , we can understand the whole phase diagram . the metallic phase in pink region",
    "can be understood easily because both of the orbitals are away from the condition of half - filling .",
    "the most interesting part of the phase diagram is the metallic phase indicated by the black dashed line and the osmp in the orange region .",
    "the black dashed line represents the state in which the lower orbital is half - filled but metallic . on the contrary , in the orange area , the lower orbital is also half - filled but it is in a mott phase , and as a whole the system is in an osmp .",
    "these facts remind us that the lower half - filled orbital should have undergone a mit when the doping becomes larger and the mit has strong connection with the plateau of electron filling .",
    "actually , as mentioned above , when the filling of the lower orbital continues to increase to be half - filled by increasing the cfs , the rest of the doped electrons will fill the upper orbital , and these electrons will interact with the electrons in the lower orbital through the strong hund s coupling to help to form total local magnetic moments and stabilize them .",
    "the more doped electrons , the larger magnetic moments and it means that the system favors a high - spin state ( hs ) when doping becomes large .    to illustrate this , we calculate the spin - spin correlation function and the effective local magnetic moments . the spin - spin correlation function can be used to describe the dynamical screening of the local magnetic moments , which is defined as , @xmath53 where , @xmath54 is the imaginary time , @xmath55 is the total @xmath56-component of spin angular momentum for orbital @xmath17 , @xmath57 is the land @xmath58-factor for spin , @xmath59 is the bohr magnetic moment .",
    "@xmath60 measures instantaneous magnetic moments formed mainly due to the hund s coupling and the screened magnetic moments can be measured at longer time @xmath48 ( @xmath61 ) , so if @xmath36 approaches to a nonzero constant at longer time , then it indicates that some screened ( frozen ) moments survive after the dynamical screening by the mobile electrons . in figure",
    "[ fig : chitau](a , b ) , we plot @xmath36 for upper orbital @xmath62 , lower orbital @xmath63 and total contribution @xmath64 for two cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath43 , in which both the lower orbitals are half - filled . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the system is in osmp , and @xmath36 of both orbitals quickly approaches to a nonzero constant , which indicates that the screening is not effective and not only well - defined local moments form in the half - filled insulating band but also frozen local moments form in the partially filled metallic band . for @xmath51 ,",
    "both orbitals are metallic , and @xmath36 quickly decays and approaches to a small constant at very long time , which means that the screening process is much more effective and only small frozen moments survive .",
    "so , we can conclude that increasing doping indeed helps to form local magnetic moments .",
    "to further measure the total and orbital - resolved local magnetic moments quantitatively , we define the effective @xmath56-component of local magnetic moments @xmath37 by averaging @xmath36 over @xmath48 from 0 to @xmath65 , which are @xmath66 @xmath67 note that the curie - weiss law @xmath68 will be satisfied if @xmath69 is very close to @xmath60 and the system is rotationally invariant , where @xmath70 is the quantum number of total spin . in our case ,",
    "the system is not rotationally invariant , so we just discuss the @xmath56-component of them as an approximation to measure the size of local magnetic moments . in figure  [ fig : meff ] , we plot the spin - spin correlation function at @xmath71 for upper orbital @xmath72 ( fig .

[ fig : meff]d ) as a function of cfs for @xmath47 at @xmath76 , respectively . for large doping , the upper metallic orbital has considerable frozen local magnetic moments which will contribute to the total local magnetic moments , see fig .",
    "[ fig : meff](a , b ) . in the osmp phase for @xmath77",

    "note that , by definition , @xmath78 , instead , @xmath79 .    in the presence of large local magnetic moments , the charge fluctuation will be suppressed because the electrons will be scattered by the local magnetic moments . as a result ,",
    "the effective coulomb correlation strength @xmath80 of the lower half - filled orbital will be enhanced when increasing doping , after a critical value @xmath81 , the lower orbital will undergo a mit and an osmt occurs . in summary , the more doping , the larger local magnetic moments and the wider osmp region , and the osmt occurs as long as the electron filling per orbital comes into the plateau . in the osmp region , the itinerant electrons of the upper orbital will show non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior .",
    "this is due to the scattering by the large total local magnetic moments , including the contribution of local moments in the lower insulating band and the frozen moments in the upper metallic band . at @xmath82 ,",

    "two orbitals keep degenerate and another orbital is lifted by the cfs .",

    "the osmt occurs when the lower two orbitals are half - filled and the doping is large enough .",
    "it seems that the osmp region is smaller than that of the two - band case , actually , this is due to the choice of the coulomb interaction @xmath5 and hund s coupling @xmath21 .    finally , we would emphasize that the difference between this mechanism of osmt and previous studies of the osmt in doped multi - band hubbard models . in their studies , the bands have different band width , so the effective coulomb interaction strength is different for each band , which may lead to an osmt .",
    "however , in our study , we do nt need the condition of different band width , and the effective coulomb interaction strength of the lower bands will be enhanced by the local magnetic moments which are formed and stabilized by the doping electrons of the upper band , thus leading to an osmt .",
    "in summary , we have found a doping - driven osmt in multi - band hubbard model with equal band width in the presence of the cfs . when the hund s coupling is large enough",
    ", the doped electrons in the upper orbital will help to form large local magnetic moments which will scatter electrons and suppress the charge fluctuation , thus the effective correlation strength of the lower orbitals will increase large enough to undergo a mit .",
    "in such a way , an osmt occurs .",
    "the more doping , the more stable osmp .",
    "this mechanism of osmt can be realized in both two - band hubbard model and three - band hubbard model with ising - type and rotational invariant hund s coupling .",
    "we hope that this mechanism of osmt can also be found in some realistic strongly correlated metallic materials .",
