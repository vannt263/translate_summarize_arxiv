    "hydrogen is the most abundant element in the atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and in their outflows .",
    "it may be found in the form of atomic hydrogen , h , or molecular hydrogen , h@xmath6 , besides relatively minor ( in abundance ) species .",
    "the fraction of hydrogen in each of these two forms is an important factor controlling the atmospheric structures of red giants and also the winds which develop from their atmospheres ( e.g. lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study the circumstellar environments of agb stars in the low excitation hydrogen lines .",
    "unfortunately molecular hydrogen is presently difficult to detect because its lowest rotational lines lie in a region of the spectrum which can not be accessed from the ground , and because a high spectral resolution is needed .    on the other hand atomic hydrogen",
    "has a line at 21 cm in an easily accessible , and well protected , region of the radio spectrum .",
    "however the observations are difficult because the intensity is weak and above all because there is a contamination by interstellar hydrogen along the same lines of sight . for a long time",
    "these difficulties have limited the h  observations of agb sources to @xmath7 cet ( bowers & knapp 1988 , bk1988 ) .",
    "nevertheless we recently readdressed this question with the upgraded nanay radiotelescope and could detect this line in emission towards several agb sources .",
    "we have already presented our results on four of them : rs cnc ( grard & le  bertre 2003 , paper i ) , ep aqr and y cvn ( le  bertre & grard 2004 , paper ii ) and x her ( gardan et al .",
    "2006 , paper iii ) .",
    "we detected these four agb sources with a good signal - to - noise ratio and showed that the line profiles are composite .",
    "the individual components have gaussian - like profiles , although in some cases a rectangular profile could be fitted as well .",
    "the h  emissions are spread over a velocity range confined to the total co velocity extent .",
    "however , we noted that sometimes the central velocities in co and h  do not coincide exactly .",
    "furthermore , in paper i , we argued that atomic hydrogen is present already in the stellar atmosphere of the central star ( rs cnc ) which might even be devoid of molecular hydrogen . in paper",
    "ii we could resolve angularly two circumstellar shells , and show that h  may be present at large distances from the central stars , 0.5 pc or more for ep aqr .",
    "the h  data display a large scale asymmetry suggesting that asymmetric structures may show up early in the agb phase ( ep aqr & x her ) , well before the planetary nebula phase . in the case of the source associated to y cvn ,",
    "the h  data even seem to probe a large region extending out to where the stellar outflow is interacting with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it thus appears that the h  emission line profiles , when observed with a good signal - to - noise ratio and a fair removal of the ism contamination , may reveal important clues on the physics of stellar outflows and their kinematics .",
    "also , as atomic hydrogen has a long lifetime in the ism , it can be used to trace circumstellar envelopes out to large radial distances . in the present paper , we give results on 22 new sources for which we have now good quality spectra , or good upper limits .",
    "the main emphasis of our programme is put on agb sources and we have tried to select a variety of representative specimens in terms of variability types , chemical composition , mass loss rates , etc . in addition , we have also included two planetary nebulae in order to sample more completely the post - main - sequence evolution of stars of low and intermediate masses .",
    "two of our sources have already been observed in h  with the very large array ( vla ) , @xmath7 ceti ( bk1988 ) and ngc7293 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2002 , r2002 ) .",
    "this allows a useful comparison between single - dish and interferometric data .",
    "the observations have been performed with the nanay radiotelescope ( nrt ) .",
    "the nrt is a meridian instrument with a rectangular effective aperture of 160m@xmath830 m .",
    "the hpbw at 21 cm is 4@xmath0 in the east - west direction and 22@xmath0 in the north - south direction .",
    "it has been upgraded ( van driel et al . 1996 ) and reopened to observations in 2001 .",
    "the point source efficiency is 1.4 kjy@xmath9 at 21 cm and the total system noise @xmath10 35k .",
    "the autocorrelator has 8192 channels split in 4 banks of 2048 , recording the linear ( pa = 0 and 90@xmath11 ) and circular polarisations .",
    "for our programme we consider only the total intensity ( stokes parameter i ) .",
    "two modes of observation have been used . in the frequency - switch ( f - switch )",
    "mode , the data are acquired on source with a spectral resolution of 0.08 kms@xmath9  and a bandwidth of 160 kms@xmath9 . this mode is very useful to check the level of interstellar h  emission in the direction of the source . a first indication of this level can be obtained by consulting the existing galactic h  surveys ( e.g. hartmann & burton 1997 ) , but their sensitivity limits are too high to readily select directions in which it might be possible to detect circumstellar h  with a priori minimum background confusion . in the course of our programme ,",
    "we characterize qualitatively the confusion by `` weak '' , `` mean '' and `` high '' .",
    "these indications are reported in table  [ hitab_a ] ( col .",
    "2 , see sect .  [ sample ] ) .",
    "they are based on hartmann & burton s results that are obtained with a single dish of hpbw @xmath12 , as well as on our own f - switch observations .",
    "it should be noted that the impact of confusion depends on the telescope beam size and on the observing strategy , in particular single - dish versus interferometric mode .",
    "exceptionnally h  from the source can be seen directly on the f - switch spectra ( e.g. y cvn , paper ii ) .    for the circumstellar h  observations proper we use the position - switch mode , in which the telescope field of view ( f.o.v . ) is alternated between the on - source position and 2 off - source positions , placed symmetrically in the east - west direction .",
    "we refer to paper ii for a more detailed description of our observing procedure .",
    "it has proven to be most effective in separating the circumstellar emission from the interstellar one .",
    "a reason for this success comes from the fan beam shape ( @xmath13 ) of the telescope that allows a good east - west discrimination of the circumstellar envelope against the galactic h  background .",
    "it should be noted that this procedure works perfectly when the intensity of the background varies linearly in right ascension across the region centered on the source .",
    "however , if the background presents a quadratic variation , or variations of higher _ even _ orders , spurious spectral features may appear .",
    "such features generally grow rapidly with increasing separation between the 2 off - positions , which allows to identify them .",
    "in general we selected a bandwidth of 80 kms@xmath9  with a spectral resolution of 0.04 kms@xmath9 .",
    "for some sources where a large expansion velocity is expected from co line data or where galactic confusion affected part of the spectrum , we have used a bandwidth of 160 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the data are then smoothed to give a final spectral resolution of 0.32 kms@xmath9 . except",
    "when mentioned otherwise , this resolution is used by default in the figures ( sect .  [ sample ] ) .    finally , the source sizes are often comparable or larger than the nrt beam ( 4@xmath0 in the east - west direction )",
    ". the intensity increases with beam throw and then reaches a maximum for @xmath14 n beams when both off - positions ( east and west ) lie entirely outside the source .",
    "we then reconstruct the total intensity ( @xmath15 ) by summing up the source fluxes in the different off - positions ( @xmath16 ) and in the central position ( @xmath17 ) : + @xmath18 this is done by combining the position - switch spectra obtained at @xmath14 k beams ( @xmath19 ) in the following expression : @xmath20 n being such that the intensity in 2 successive position - switch spectra is the same , i.e. @xmath21 . the radius of the source can then be estimated to @xmath22 .",

    "( 2 ) reduces to : + @xmath24 in the figures ( next section ) , the position - switch spectra ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc . )",
    "are shown in the upper panels , and their averages and the final spectra ( @xmath15 ) are displayed at the bottom ( continuous and dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "the average spectrum has a physical meaning only for an unresolved source ( equ .",
    "however , the resulting signal - to - noise ratio is in general higher than for the total spectrum , so that spectral details are sometimes better seen on the average profile ( see , e.g. below , y uma or r peg ) .",
    "the difference between the two sets of spectra is the result of the source resolution by the 4@xmath0 beam .",
    "table [ sample_tab ] lists the sources discussed in the present paper .",

    "the distances ( col . 6 ) are in general deduced from the hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "next ( col .",
    "7 ) , we give an estimate of the stellar effective temperature , t@xmath27 .",
    "this datum is important because hydrogen in the stellar atmosphere and in the inner circumstellar envelope is expected to be mostly atomic for t@xmath27@xmath28 2500 k and molecular for t@xmath27@xmath5 2500 k ( glassgold & huggins 1993 , gh1983 ) .",
    "finally we give the lsr radial velocity ( v@xmath29 , col .",
    "8) , the expansion velocity ( v@xmath30 , col .",
    "9 ) , and the mass loss rate , estimated in general from co rotational line data .",
    "these data are useful because both the central velocity and the velocity extent of the h  lines are expected to be close to those given by the co lines . in general co data from different observers",
    "are consistent within @xmath142 kms@xmath9 .",

    "u cmi , ngc 6369 ) , we adopt equivalent parameters from optical observations . unfortunately , optical data seem less reliable than co data ( @xmath145 kms@xmath9 ) , perhaps in part due to the stellar variability . except for u cmi ,",
    "circumstellar envelopes have been detected around all sources of our sample , either in the co radio lines , or in optical lines .",

    "one of the most striking results emerging from our survey is that we find h  line - profiles with a quasi - gaussian shape , whereas we were expecting rectangular profiles , for unresolved sources , or double - horn ones , for resolved sources .",
    "sometimes the profile seems triangular with a peak close to the centroid velocity ( e.g. rt vir , fig .",

    "the line profile shows two horns with peaks separated by twice the expansion velocity .",
    "these simulations were performed assuming a uniform response within the telescope beam . however , introducing a more realistic response did not significantly change the results ( see e.g. figure 7 in paper iii ) .",
    "we seldom observe double - horn profiles .",

    "we also note that ngc7293 shows several components that could be interpreted as horns .",

    "previously , in a few peculiar cases , we detected a component of the h  emission that might be fitted by a rectangle ( rs cnc , paper i ; ep aqr , paper ii ; x her , paper iii ) . in these cases ,",
    "the width is relatively narrow , @xmath10 3 - 4 kms@xmath9 .    to get centrally peaked profiles we had to assume that the h  velocity is varying with distance from the central star . for resolved sources",
    "the velocity has to decrease to zero relative to the stellar radial velocity .",
    "a large quantity of hydrogen has to accumulate close to zero velocity , otherwise a deficit appears in the center of the profile . for unresolved sources",
    ", the velocity could be assumed to decrease as well as to increase with distance .",
    "however , it would be unlikely to get increasing velocities only for unresolved sources , and therefore we can conclude that , on scales probed by the h  emission , the expansion velocity always decreases with distance from the central star .",
    "this slowing - down of the circumstellar wind could be due to its interaction with external matter , either remains of previous episodes of mass loss and/or surrounding ism ( young et al .",
    "1993b ; paper ii ) .",
    "the slowing - down is also suggested by the comparison of the expansion velocity derived from the co line - profiles to the half - fwhm of the h  line ( fig .",
    "[ vitesse ] ) . except for afgl 3068 and w hya ,",
    "the former is always larger than the latter .",
    "we note that afgl 3068 is at a large distance from the galactic plane ( @xmath10 740 pc ) , perhaps in a region devoid of interstellar matter .",
    "in general a gaussian profile can result from thermal and turbulent broadening , as well as from systematic motions of the gas .",
    "presently in our modelling , we are not taking into account thermal and turbulent effects . on the one hand",
    "their inclusion in the model may force to reduce the h  outflow velocity because they will provide a supplementary source of line broadening .",
    "on the other hand the velocity gradient may have to be reduced and outflow velocities close to 0 ( relative to the central star ) may not be needed ( libert , grard & le bertre , in preparation ) .",

    "1993a ) or by iso ( izumiura & hashimoto 1999 ) . this may be an effect of the dust emission dependence on temperature that may impede the detection of matter far from the central star or indicate a relatively recent onset of copious mass - loss rate that is not reflected in the hi spectra .",

    "a recent onset of the mass loss in sources like wx psc or nml tau ( that was not resolved by iras , young 1993a ) might explain their non - detection in h. indeed in young compact sources with central star effective temperature lower than 2500k , most of the circumstellar matter may be molecular ( see sect .",
    "[ molhydrogen ] ) .",
    "we have also examined our position - switch data by using separately the two off - positions .",
    "the profiles are severely affected by the spatial variations of the background and the resulting spectra suffer much more from galactic h  confusion , which makes them in general difficult to exploit .",

    "young et al . ( 1993b ) find that among nearby stars semi - regular variables are more likely to be resolved than miras .",
    "our statistics is small but our results ( at least for oxygen - rich sources ) tend to agree with their conclusion that semi - regular variables have been losing mass for a longer duration than miras . on the other hand they do not find evidence that the shapes of the shells are distorted by interaction with the ism ,",
    "which we do ( see also sect .",

    "the difference is still more striking when comparing the total h   masses ( col . 3 in table  3 ) .",

    "the larger extension of carbon - rich sources as compared to oxygen - rich ones is not so surprising as carbon - rich agb stars should be in a phase of evolution that follows the oxygen - rich stage . and",
    "the longer the star loses mass , the larger the mass of its circumstellar shell .",
    "we have detected h  emission in sources with and without emission from the co rotational lines .",
    "for instance @xmath31 her is detected with a peak intensity @xmath10 50 mjy at @xmath52 , but was not detected in co by heske ( 1990 ) although the presence of circumstellar matter close to the central star was demonstrated by deutsch ( 1956 ) .",
    "we note that this situation appears preferentially for warm giants with t@xmath27@xmath28 3000 k. it suggests that co is underabundant in these sources for which the outflows might be mostly atomic",

    "knapp et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not detect c  at 492 ghz from @xmath31 her , but this could be an effect of a cyclic variation of the mass loss rate , the region that they probed being only 15@xmath46 in diameter .",
    "we also note that our estimate for the average mass loss rate is 2.5 times larger than that of deutsch ( 1956 ) .",
    "we sometimes easily detect h  from semi - regular variables with low mass loss rates whereas we may not detect it from miras with large mass loss rates .",
    "this may be an effect of the dependence of the h@xmath6/h  equilibrium in the stellar atmosphere on temperature .",
    "indeed the stellar effective temperature of the former are larger than 2500 k , and smaller for the latter , and gh1983 show that hydrogen should be mostly atomic for t@xmath27@xmath28 2500 k , and molecular for t@xmath27@xmath5 2500 k. atomic hydrogen should then be present only in the external parts of the circumstellar shells of miras with large mass loss rates where h@xmath6 is photo - dissociated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "this point is further discussed in sect .",
    "[ coldhi ] and [ molhydrogen ] .",
    "co and h  can trace outflows only where these species are present .",
    "if we now compare co and h  profiles of sources that show both emissions , we find that , with the notable exception of @xmath7 cet , they often differ .",
    "co profiles are generally parabolic or rectangular whereas h  profiles are gaussian or triangular .",
    "the h  emission is found within the range encompassed by the co emission .",
    "the h  fwhm is generally smaller than the expansion velocity determined from co data ( fig .",
    "[ vitesse ] ) .",
    "sometimes its centroid is shifted by 1 - 3 kms@xmath9  with respect to the co centroid .",
    "for instance , in y  uma , we find h  emission from 14 to 20 kms@xmath9  with a centroid at 17 kms@xmath9 , whereas the co emission spans from 14 to 24 kms@xmath9  and is centered at 19 kms@xmath9  ( knapp et al .",
    "although the kinematics of the outflows should be the same in co and h , the regions that are probed by these two tracers are different .",
    "firstly , the beams are different , typically 10 - 50@xmath46 for co observations , and 4@xmath8822@xmath0 for our h  observations .",
    "secondly , co and atomic hydrogen may be present in different zones of the circumstellar shells .",
    "for instance co is expected to be photodissociated by the interstellar radiation field at distances @xmath10 10@xmath89 - 10@xmath90 cm depending on the mass loss rate ( mamon et al .",
    "1990 ) , whereas h  should in general be protected from photo - dissociation by the surrounding ism .",
    "therefore co and h  trace different parts of the circumstellar shells .",
    "finally the co line - profiles and intensities are expected to depend on excitation and optical depth effects much more than for h.    when we compare the mass loss rates estimated from the h  line profiles to those obtained from co rotational lines , we do not find any clear trend ( fig .",
    "[ masslossco ] ) .",
    "this probably indicates that the mass loss rate varies by an order of magnitude over timescales @xmath10 10@xmath91 years .",
    "nevertheless , we note that miras tend to lie below the one - to - one line , and semi - regulars above it .",
    "it thus appears that the h  line at 21 cm and the co rotational lines are complementary tracers of the circumstellar outflows and that they are equally needed to describe these media .",
    "in general our data are affected by the large scale structure of the galactic h  emission .",
    "thus the final limits of detection are not set by the sensitivity of the observations but by the effectiveness in removing the galactic emission .",
    "when the position - switch procedure has been effective we have qualified the confusion as weak ( table [ hitab_a ] ) . for `` medium '' and `` high '' confusion part of the h  spectrum",
    "can be affected .",
    "it indicates that matter in a direction close to the target and at velocities in the expected range has been detected . in general this matter , that can be at any distance along the line of sight ,",
    "should not be related to the stellar source .",
    "however , as the central stars may have been undergoing mass loss for a long duration and/or during a previous stage of evolution ( e.g. the rgb ) , in some cases it might be that this matter ( or part of it ) is physically related to the source .",
    "for instance , the interaction of the outflow with its surrounding leads to the formation of a shell made of compressed circumstellar material and swept - up circumstellar / interstellar matter ( sect .",
    "[ lineprofiles ] ) .",
    "the matter in this shell should be at velocity close to the central star velocity .",
    "if part of the material lost by the central star is mixed in position and in velocity with the surrounding ism , we may never be able to get an exhaustive balance of the mass lost by the central stars .",
    "for instance , in their h   study of ic  418 , taylor et al .",
    "( 1989 ) noted that part of the detected hydrogen , blueshifted with respect to the pn system velocity , can not be identified unambiguously as circumstellar or interstellar matter .      for several sources we observe a shift between the central velocities of the h  and co lines ( @xmath10 1 - 3 kms@xmath9 ) . in some cases",
    "we also observe an offset of the h  source with respect to the stellar position ( @xmath10 1 - 4 ) .",
    "such a kind of offset has not been observed in co. since the h  emission profiles show evidence of a slowing - down of the stellar outflows by the surrounding ism ( paper ii and iii , sect .  [ lineprofiles ] ) , and since the central stars are moving with respect to the ism ] , we may suspect that these velocity shifts and spatial offsets are due to a non - isotropic interaction between the outflows and the ism .",
    "one may also consider a gradient in the ism density that would induce a non - isotropic slowing - down of the circumstellar outflow .    in order to corroborate this hypothesis",
    "we have used the non - spherical model of h  emission developed by gardan et al .",
    "( 2006 , paper iii ) .",
    "as an example we consider a source located at 140 pc with an outflow corresponding to a mass loss in atomic hydrogen of 5@xmath5410@xmath34 m@xmath42yr@xmath9 , and that is initially spherical and isotropic . the velocity is taken to decrease linearly from an inner boundary located at 0.1  ( or 4@xmath5410@xmath65 pc ) from the central star . to simulate a non - isotropic interaction ,",
    "we adopt a velocity law as : + @xmath92 with v expressed in kms@xmath9 , r in , and @xmath3 being a polar angle .",
    "the slowing down of the outflow is maximum for @xmath3 = 0@xmath11 and minimum for @xmath3 = 180@xmath11 .",
    "the geometry of the circumstellar shell is thus progressively becoming egg - shaped .",
    "for this test , we adopt a typical duration of 50@xmath5410@xmath93 years , such that the outer boundary is located at 5  ( 0.2 pc ) for @xmath3 = 0@xmath11 , with v = 1 kms@xmath9 , and 7.2  ( @xmath10 0.3 pc ) for @xmath3 = 180@xmath11 , with v @xmath10 2.8 kms@xmath9 .",

    "in that case the emission remains centered on the star position . finally , if the polar axis is oriented 45@xmath11 away from the observer and at a position angle of 90@xmath11 ( fig .  [ simulation ] ,",

    "this simulation shows that a slowing - down of the stellar outflow more pronounced in a given direction could produce either a shift in velocity of the h  emission line , or an offset in position of this emission , or a combination of both .",
    "this effect may add to an intrinsic asymmetry due to the mass loss from the central star , as we showed for x her ( paper iii ) .",
    "we have detected h  in emission towards afgl3068 .",
    "however , we have previously reported the detection of h  _ in absorption _ towards a similar source , irc+10216 , ( le  bertre & grard 2001 ) , indicating that the gas in the outflow cools down to a temperature below 4 k. such a low temperature was predicted for high mass loss rate agb stars as a result of adiabatic expansion ( jura et al . 1988 ; sahai 1990 ) . at first sight",
    "it is puzzling that we do not observe the same effect in afgl3068 of mass loss rate about 5 times larger .",
    "however the distances to these sources differ by a factor @xmath10 8 , so that the nrt beam scales as 0.16pc@xmath540.86pc for irc+10216 as compared to 1.3pc@xmath547.3pc for afgl3068 .",
    "therefore , in the case of afgl3068 we have explored a very external region where grain photo - electric heating might become important .",
    "for instance , in their models of irc+10216 , crosas & menten ( 1997 ) and groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) predict that the temperature should increase at r @xmath94 0.1 pc due to this effect ( although their minima are still higher than our observational upper limit ) .",
    "the h  detection of irc+10216 in absorption and of afgl3068 in emission might then be explained as a combined effect of beam size and distance .",
    "if this is correct , the h  mass that we have derived for afgl 3068 may be underestimated due to absorption against the background .",
    "the gas temperature in the circumstellar envelopes depends strongly on the mass - loss rate ( e.g. jura et al .",
    "it is expected to be larger in the sources with low mass - loss rate ( @xmath10 10@xmath34 m@xmath42yr@xmath9 ) than in those with high mass - loss rate ( @xmath10 10@xmath32 m@xmath42yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "low mass - loss rate sources , and in particular semi - regular variables , are therefore less liable to contain very cold atomic hydrogen in their envelopes . on the other hand , this effect may concern miras with substantial mass loss rate , like wx psc or nml tau .",
    "hydrogen in stars with low atmospheric temperature ( t@xmath95 2500 k ) should be molecular ( gh1983 ) .",
    "the expected lifetime of molecular hydrogen in the ism is @xmath10 1000 years for a standard interstellar radiation field ( le petit et al .",
    "this translates to r @xmath10 10@xmath65 or 10@xmath75 pc for an average expansion velocity of 1 or 10 kms@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "however , molecular hydrogen is self - shielded ( morris & jura 1983 ) and the real extent of an h@xmath96 circumstellar envelope depends on the mass loss rate and the velocity field . for instance",
    "gh1983 estimate that , for a mass loss rate of 4@xmath5410@xmath32 m@xmath42yr@xmath9  and a uniform expansion velocity of 16 kms@xmath9 , the radius of the molecular envelope would be @xmath10 0.2 pc .",
    "it is therefore important to check the presence of atomic hydrogen at large distance from the central star for those with low effective temperature . as sources with low effective temperature",
    "are also those with presently high mass - loss rate ( e.g. wx psc , nml tau ) , atomic hydrogen may be detected in these sources , either in absorption or in emission , only at large distances from the central stars , and , of course , only if mass loss has been operating for a long enough time .",
    "we have undertaken a search for the h  line at 21 cm in the direction of agb stars and related sources .",
    "we have detected circumstellar h  in a variety of sources sampling the post main - sequence evolution of low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the emissions are extended indicating shell sizes from 0.2 pc to more than 2 pc .",
    "the h  line can therefore be used to trace the mass loss history for long periods , up to several 10@xmath91 years .",
    "however , we may have missed atomic hydrogen at low temperature ( @xmath5  10  k ) and hydrogen locked into h@xmath6 .    for some sources ( @xmath2 per ,",
    "@xmath3 her , @xmath4 lyr , u cmi ) our h  detection is the first radio detection .",
    "the h  line - profiles indicate that the outflows are slowing down , probably due to the interaction with surrounding matter .",
    "furthermore , we observe offsets in velocity and spatial asymmetries that indicate a distortion of the outflows .",
    "these effects were already noted for ep aqr ( paper ii ) and for x her ( paper iii ) , and seem frequent .",
    "they could be connected to the motion of the sources with respect to the local ism , or to its inhomogeneity , as well as to the mass ejection process itself .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for his / her detailed review that helped us improve our paper .",
