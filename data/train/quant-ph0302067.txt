    "the notion of a characteristic time arises in a variety of situations in quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , concerning the decay of an atom , one is interested in the characteristic decay time , or lifetime .",
    "typically , one would conduct measurements on an ensemble of independently and identically prepared systems , whereby the lifetime is estimated as an ensemble mean . for a particle trapped in a potential",
    ", one would be interested in the tunneling time , the time in which the particle escapes from the trap .",
    "there are many other circumstances in which one is interested in the time required for an initial state of the system to evolve into another state under the action of a given hamiltonian , or more generally , under some given setup .",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references cited therein ) for a discussion on various characteristic times in quantum theory .",
    "it is curious that , despite its experimental importance , precise statistical bounds on the estimation accuracy of time in quantum mechanics have only been obtained fairly recently @xcite .",
    "one of such characteristic times , namely , the time required for a given initial state @xmath0 to evolve into another state orthogonal to @xmath0 , has attracted some attention because of its relevance to quantum computation and computational capacity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , given a generic state @xmath0 and a hamiltonian , it is more likely that @xmath0 will never evolve into a state orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , for some special cases this can occur , which is the situation we study here . in particular , we call the minimum time required for a state to be transformed into an orthogonal state a passage time .",
    "the lower bound for the passage time is known as the fleming bound @xcite .",
    "our main objective here is to give an elementary derivation of the passage time , and illustrate the result for some simple systems .",
    "let us first state more explicitly the problem at hand .",
    "consider an @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 , and a hamiltonian @xmath3 with eigenvalues @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "for definiteness , we suppose that the energy eigenvalues are all distinct , although this is not essential in the ensuing argument .",
    "the time evolution of the wave function is thus effected by a one parameter family of unitary operators @xmath6 now , the hilbert space @xmath2 carries an essentially redundant complex degree of freedom , i.e. the overall complex phase associated with the wave function .",
    "thus , we consider equivalence classes of wave functions , obtained by the identification @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "we consider the space of rays through the origin of @xmath2 .",
    "this is just the projective hilbert space @xmath8 , endowed with the usual fubini - study metric defined by the transition probability @xcite . by abuse of notation , we use the symbol @xmath0 to denote both a point of @xmath8 , _ and _ its representative elements in @xmath2 .",
    "this should not cause confusion .    given a hilbert space and a hamiltonian @xmath3",
    ", we seek to determine the time required for a state @xmath0 to be transformed , under unitary evolution , into another state @xmath9 orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , the problem addressed here can be stated as follows :    * does there exist a time @xmath10 such that the state defined by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    to @xmath0 , that is , @xmath12 , and , * if so , what is the minimum value of @xmath10 ?",
    "such a minimum time @xmath10 , if it exists , will be called the _ passage time _ , and denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we shall show that , in fact , there exist infinitely many , although rather special , states @xmath0 such that @xmath12 for a suitable choice of passage time @xmath13 , and that the value of @xmath13 for these states is typically given _",
    "exactly _ by the expressions @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are as defined below ( note that the passage time in @xcite is defined to be given by @xmath17 for an arbitrary state , whereas our definition here is more refined because we impose orthogonality condition ) .",
    "there are also cases for which passage times exist but are larger than @xmath13 of ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "explicit examples will be given .",
    "we also show , using the anandan - aharonov relation , that ( [ eq:4 ] ) actually provides the _ sharpest obtainable bound _ for the passage time .",
    "in order to verify ( [ eq:4 ] ) , we first take note of the hermitian correspondence between points and hyperplanes of codimension one in a projective hilbert space @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "specifically , given a point @xmath18 , the corresponding projective hyperplane consists of those points @xmath19 satisfying the algebraic relation @xmath20 thus , if @xmath0 is transformed by @xmath21 into a point @xmath9 orthogonal to @xmath0 , then @xmath9 must lie on this hyperplane , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that such a pair @xmath22 of points exists , we can join the two points by a projective line @xmath23 ; the points on this line represent the totality of normalised superpositions of the states @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "since a complex projective line in real terms is just a two - sphere @xmath24 , we can visualise this configuration as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "note that the orthogonality of @xmath0 and @xmath9 implies that they are _ antipodal _ on @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , the geodesics of the fubini - study metric that join the two points @xmath0 and @xmath9 are just the great circle arcs of the sphere @xmath24 that contain these points .",
    "next , we observe that , _ if there exists a unitary evolution transforming @xmath0 into @xmath9 along a geodesic curve , then there must be a pair of energy eigenstates , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , say , at the poles of @xmath24 , such that @xmath0 and @xmath9 lie on the equator_. this is because the dynamics induced by unitary evolution on any projective line joining a pair of energy eigenstates corresponds to a rigid rotation of the two - sphere @xmath24 in @xmath8 , with the said energy eigenstates as fixed points .",
    "therefore , if we regard , conversely , the states @xmath0 and @xmath9 as forming a pair of poles on @xmath24 , then the two energy eigenstates @xmath25 and @xmath26 will lie on the corresponding equator .",
    "in other words , we have , for some @xmath27 , the relations @xmath28 and @xmath29 since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are antipodal points of @xmath24 . applying the unitary operator @xmath30 to both sides of ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 this follows from the fact that , by assumption , the unitary operator @xmath30 for a particular value of @xmath10 interchanges two states @xmath0 and @xmath9 . thus , forming the inner products of the respective right and left sides of ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) , we find that @xmath33 similarly , from ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) we obtain @xmath34 then , addition of equations ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) yields the condition @xmath35 which is satisfied if we set @xmath36 where we assume @xmath37 . choosing the smallest value for @xmath38 and writing @xmath39 we thus obtain the minimum value @xmath13 of the passage time , given by @xmath40    to summarise , when @xmath0 is transformed into an orthogonal state @xmath9 by a one - parameter family of unitary transformations _ along a geodesic curve _",
    ", then the time required is given _ exactly _ by ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "we have not yet considered the possibility that @xmath0 unitarily evolves into @xmath9 along another curve .",
    "if an alternative path exists , then the length of the trajectory is necessarily longer , since any such path will not be a geodesic . if @xmath0 is expressible as a superposition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the trajectory of @xmath41 never leaves the projective line that joins these two states , and hence there exists no alternative path .",
    "the case in which @xmath0 is expressed as a superposition of more than two energy eigenstates will be discussed below .",
    "we note , incidentally , that an alternative bound on passage time was proposed by margolus and levitin @xcite , who _ argued _ that a sharper bound for @xmath13 exists and is given by the expression @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the state @xmath0 . however , this inequality is in general not physically viable , and it is in fact never sharper than the right - hand side of ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "this is because the physical characteristics of quantum systems are invariant under an overall shift of the energy spectrum , and hence without loss of generality we may set , for example , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , and ( [ eq:15 ] ) becomes meaningless . to avoid this problem ,",
    "margolus and levitin fix the energy scale so that @xmath46 for all @xmath47",
    ". only then does the inequality ( [ eq:15 ] ) become technically valid . however ,",
    "this bound , when @xmath48 , is never attained except in one special case where @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider how the passage time @xmath13 obtained in ( [ eq:14 ] ) is related to the dispersion @xmath52 of the energy .",
    "this is of interest , because a previously derived bound on the passage time is expressed in terms of the energy dispersion @xcite . in the present situation",
    ", we can compute @xmath53 explicitly , because the state is expressible in the form @xmath54 for some @xmath55 . by a direct calculation ,",
    "the energy dispersion in the state ( [ eq:17 ] ) is @xmath56 from which we obtain fleming s bound @xmath57 as indicated in @xcite .",
    "this relation is indeed natural if we recall the anandan - aharonov relation @xcite which states that the ` speed ' of the evolution of a given quantum state is given by @xmath58 . the fubini - study distance between a pair of orthogonal states",
    "is given by @xmath59 , and this distance divided by the velocity determines the required time .",
    "since the velocity @xmath60 of the quantum state is a constant under the action of the unitary group , while the minimum distance of the trajectory joining a pair of orthogonal states is always @xmath59 , it follows that the fleming bound can be derived directly from the anandan - aharonov relation .",
    "we have considered thus far the case in which the state @xmath0 is expressible as a superposition of two energy eigenstates .",
    "next , suppose that @xmath0 is expressed as a superposition of more than two energy eigenstates .",
    "it is not difficult to see that , in this case , if @xmath0 can be transformed into an orthogonal state by a unitary operator @xmath61 , then the energy spectrum @xmath4 must fulfil rather stringent constraints .",
    "thus , such a transformation can occur only for rather special states , in systems such that the energy spectrum @xmath62 has a particularly simple structure .",
    "in other words , a generic state in this case will not evolve into an orthogonal state under the action of @xmath63 .",
    "it is , nevertheless , of some interest to analyse such examples in order to gain further insight into the phenomena involved .",
    "let us consider , for simplicity , a state @xmath0 that is expressed as a superposition of three energy eigenstates .",
    "the most general form of such a state can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 are angular coordinates , @xmath66 are phase variables , and we assume that @xmath67 . if @xmath68 transforms this state into an orthogonal state , then the condition @xmath69 must be satisfied , where @xmath70 and so on . to render the analysis more tractible , we further simplify this constraint by assuming that @xmath71 .",
    "then , ( [ eq:21 ] ) implies that a necessary condition for the state @xmath0 to evolve into an orthogonal state is given by the relation @xmath72 where @xmath73 are natural numbers such that @xmath74 . because the spectrum of a generic hamiltonian @xmath3 will not satisfy ( [ eq:22 ] )",
    ", a state @xmath0 will never evolve into a state orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "the constraint becomes even more severe if @xmath0 is expressed as a superposition of more than three eigenstates .",
    "the precise form of the constraint in such cases is just a straightforward generalisation of ( [ eq:21 ] ) .    notwithstanding these conditions ,",
    "let us suppose that the constraint ( [ eq:22 ] ) is indeed satisfied for some given hamiltonian .",
    "then , the state indeed evolves into an orthogonal state .",
    "the first time that @xmath0 becomes orthogonal to @xmath0 , in particular , is given by @xmath75 however , _ since in this case @xmath76 does not describe a geodesic path , @xmath77 will be larger than fleming s passage time @xmath13 given in _ ( [ eq:19 ] ) . indeed , without loss of generality , we may set @xmath49 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath78 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , under the constraint @xmath79 that follows from ( [ eq:22 ] ) , the squared energy dispersion in the state ( [ eq:20 ] ) is given by @xmath80 .",
    "another simple example is the cyclic evolution of a spin-1 system , with energy eigenvalues @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "consider a state @xmath84 yields latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    and we have @xmath12 . likewise",
    ", the action of @xmath86 on @xmath9 yields @xmath0 , hence , we have a cyclic evolution that interchanges a pair of orthogonal states @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , because the trajectory @xmath76 in @xmath8 does not correspond to a geodesic curve , the time required to interchange these states , given by @xmath87 , is longer that the fleming bound .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath88 in this example , because in the state ( [ eq:24 ] ) we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 so that @xmath91 . in general ,",
    "if a quantum state expressible in the form other than ( [ eq:17 ] ) does evolve into an orthogonal state , then the passage time is necessarily longer than fleming s bound ( [ eq:19 ] ) .",
    "the foregoing analysis can be extended in a natural way to the case in which the initial state of the system is impure .",
    "the situation considered here can be described as follows .",
    "suppose that we have an initial state , known to be either @xmath92 , with probability @xmath93 , or @xmath94 , with probability @xmath95 , where both of these pure states are of the form ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "in other words , the initial state is a mixed - state density matrix @xmath96 our objective in the present context is to examine the possibility that , after some lapse of time @xmath13 , the initial pure state @xmath97 evolves _ with certainty _ into a state orthogonal to @xmath97 , irrespective of whether @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "if the state @xmath92 is a superposition of energy eigenstates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and if @xmath94 is a superposition of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , then the passage time for @xmath92 is just @xmath102 , and similarly , for @xmath94 , is just @xmath103 . therefore , if the initial state evolves with certainty into an orthogonal state , then the required passage time is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the least common multiple of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , since we are uncertain about the initial state , we must , in general , wait considerably longer before we can be sure that the state is in another state orthogonal to the initial state , even though in the meantime the state may evolve into an orthogonal state and then return to itself many times .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise this argument to the case where the initial state is one of many states of the form ( [ eq:17 ] ) . in this case , the passage time is simply given by @xmath108 times the least common multiple of the inverses of the energy differences .",
    "note that , even though each possible pure state will be transformed into an orthogonal state after the system has evolved for the time @xmath13 given in ( [ eq:26 ] ) , one can not clearly argue that the density matrix @xmath109 has evolved into another mixed state orthogonal to @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , the diagonal elements of @xmath110 and @xmath109 , when expressed in the energy basis , are identical , and therefore the expectation values of any observable commuting with the hamiltonian will also be identical .",
    "this observation leads to an interesting open problem , namely , can the orthogonality of impure density matrices be defined in a meaningful fashion , and if so , does a passage time exist for mixed state density matrices with respect to this definition ."
