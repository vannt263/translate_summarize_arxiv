    "one of the standard approaches to the building of local models is regression model for electron density @xcite :    @xmath0    inspite of the fact that the model is very simple - it is just an interpolation of arbitrary function ( electron density ) as a taylor sequence using @xmath1 as small parameters , it gives a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "but it does not depend on electron density creation mechanisms , and due to this it might have sometimes a weak prediction accuracy , inspite it could describe the data used for approximation pretty accurately . in some approaches to increase the model accuracy one could take into account a dependence on averaged values of the parameters @xmath1 too , for example on @xmath2 , averaged over 81 and 3 days .    in the work i tried to suggest a way to build a regression local model with some physycal principles included .",
    "at first let us recall that electron density layers formation is mostly caused by solar radiation , and the effective radiation wavelength depend on the height@xcite . also , these mechanisms depend on earth orientation and cause a number of additional modulation effects . in the article we will analyze electron density at a selected height , the other heights could be calculated independently using the same approach .",
    "at first let us analyze the modulation effects causing electron density variations at a selected height .",
    "the first effect is a modulation of solar radiation due to solar activity changes .",
    "these changes could be quantitatively characterized by solar sunspot number ( @xmath3 - wolf numbers ) or by @xmath4 index - solar radiation at 10.7 cm wavelength .",
    "inspite of ionizing radiation and @xmath4 has different wavelengths ( 1 nm and 100 nm for d - layer , 1 - 10 nm for e - layer , 10 - 100 nm for f - layer ) , it is clear that @xmath4 is a more correct parameter than @xmath3 due to the fact that it could be defined more correct .",
    "the second modulation effect is electron density dependence on zenith angle of the sun as a function of daytime , day of year , longitude and latitude .",
    "this dependence controls the ionization processes and forms ( together with some other mechanisms ) the electron density dependence on height and time , also well - known as chapmen layer@xcite .",
    "that is why the zenith angle is also well defined parameter that must be included into the model . in this work",
    "we do not analyze hourly variations of the electron density and due to this we use only position of the earth at orbit as a basic parameter , which defines day - to - day variations of the zenith angle ( at given latitude , longitude and height):@xmath5    where @xmath6 - day number within a year .",
    "we do not analyze electron density variations with periods less that 1 day so the usage of this parameter looks correct to us .",
    "for building the model that includes variations with periods less than a day this parameter should be changed or new parameter should be added to characterize hourly variations of electron density .",
    "the third parameter , traditionally included into models , is a magnetic activity index .",
    "exact dependence of electron density on magnetic activity is not clear , but we suppose that it also modulates electron density .",
    "the forth modulation parameter includes all the hidden periodics that was not included into our model by previous 3 parameters .",
    "they might exist and be caused by different periodical changes in the ionization processes .",
    "there is a number of such potential processes , for example changes of neutral athmosphere , moon effects , etc .",
    "we do not know exact frequencies @xmath7 and phases @xmath8 of these periodics , so their number , phases and periodics should be found from data analysis .",
    "finally the model of electron density could be written in a form :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 - some positive functions , and @xmath11 - product sign .",
    "when positive function is a product of positive modulation functions ( electron density is a positive function by definition ) it is useful to analyze logarithm of this function as a sum of some functions , each of them defines its own modulation effect independently , i.e. these modulation functions work as a basis :    @xmath12    where    @xmath13    one of well known applications that uses this approach is the so - called cepstral analysis @xcite - analysis of the logarithm of the function as a sum of periodical functions .",
    "ideologically our technique is close to the cepstral analysis , but we use some non - peridical ( but lineary independent ) functions in addition to the periodical functions .",
    "let us define a structure of the unknown functions @xmath14 from some basic physical principles .",
    "the structure of the @xmath15 is clear : due to the ionising component of the radiation wavelength differs from characterstic index @xmath4 wavelength and most of the spectras in a wide region could be approximated by power low , the electron density could be in first approximation proportional to the power of the @xmath4 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 - some parameters .",
    "inspite of solar spectrum shape could depend on solar activity level , at first approximation we could suppose that its shape remains constant and only its amplitude is changed with changing @xmath4 .",
    "this automatically means that in the absence of the solar radiation the electron density becomes zero , this suggestion does not contaminate with basic physical principles .",
    "so the @xmath15 becomes :    @xmath18    lets also suppose that dependence on magnetic activity is also defined by power low ( we do this analogous to the solar activity dependence and this could not be explained from physical point of view ) :",
    "@xmath19    let us suppose that the dependence on daily variations has an exponential character :    @xmath20    due to zenith angle exponentially defines electron density for chapmen layer at a selected height @xcite :    @xmath21    or , according to @xcite by extracting the dependence on zenith angle at local noon @xmath22 :    @xmath23    where @xmath24    @xmath25 - local solar time .",
    "so @xmath26 could be written ( in a first approximation , taking into account only linearized part of argument in ( [ eq:9.1b ] ) ) as :    @xmath27    other periodical functions are just linear ones :    @xmath28    by grouping all these together we obtain the following model for electron density :    @xmath29    where @xmath30    actually , the ionosphere is pretty innertial system so its responce to the disturbancies of different periods could be different . within the suggested approach we could suppose that different periods of disturbancies cause an independent modulation ( we will call this multiranges modulation principle ) . let us suppose that in the electron density time dependence we could find some well - defined response time : 1 day as earth rotation period , 3 days as average disturbance period and 30 days as approximate solar rotation / moon rotation period .",
    "the choice of the number and exact values of these periods is not principal for now and is used for illustration of the method .    lets define logarithm of electron density @xmath31 as a sum of functions with given periods of changes :    @xmath32}(t)+ne_{log,[3d,30d]}(t)+ne_{log,>30d}(t)\\label{eq:14}\\ ] ]    the principle of making these functions @xmath33 , @xmath34}$ ] , @xmath35}(t)$ ] , @xmath36 from the source function @xmath31 is not important .",
    "it is more important that the sum is exactly @xmath31 and these functions have necessary time changes ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "one of the most simple methods is using the time averaging or using filters with rectangular bands for almost all the functions ( 1 - 3days period , 3 - 30days period and more than 30days period ) .",
    "the last function ( for example with 0 - 1 days periods ) is defined to the condition ( [ eq:14 ] ) becomes true .",
    "each of the components is approximated by the sum ( [ eq:12 ] ) :    @xmath37    where index @xmath38 defines period ranges of corresponding variations : < 1days , [ 1day,3days ] , [ 3days,30days ] , > 30days    the resulting model for the electron density logarithm is the following :    @xmath39    where the sum is calculated over all the period ranges .",
    "the index @xmath38 means applying the same filtration technique as used by us for selecting electron density periods to the argument functions :    @xmath40}(x)+log_{[3d,30d]}(x)+log_{>30d}(x)\\label{eq:17}\\ ] ]    @xmath41}(x)+decl_{[3d,30d]}(x)+decl_{>30d}(x)\\label{eq:18}\\ ] ]    so , according to this multiranges modulation principle we should choose important ionospheric response times and make the extended set of arguments by filtration of all the indexes with some filtration technique .    in the paper we will analyze only variations with periods no less than a day . in this case the model ( [ eq:16 ] ) becomes the following :    @xmath42    from right and left parts we have removed all the effects with periods less than a day .",
    "shortly , let us describe the model ( [ eq:19 ] ) :    \\1 ) according to the filtration rule ( [ eq:14 ] ) we should average logarithm of electron density at given height for whole the day .",
    "this corresponds to the geometrical averaging of the electron density with following calculation of the logarithm .",
    "\\2 ) according to the filtration rule ( [ eq:14 ] ) we should create extended set of indexes with period ranges 1 day,1 - 3days,3 - 30days and more than 30days periods from basic set of paramters @xmath1 :    @xmath43}(f_{10.7}(t)),log_{[3d,30d]}(f_{10.7}(t)),log_{>30d}(f_{10.7}(t)),\\\\ log_{1d}(ap(t)),log_{[1d,3d]}(ap(t)),log_{[3d,30d]}(ap(t)),log_{>30d}(ap(t)),\\\\ decl_{t}(t)\\end{array}\\label{eq:20}\\ ] ]    \\3 ) next step is the calculation of the coefficients @xmath44from ( [ eq:19 ] ) and minimizing the functional :    @xmath45    at first step we suppose @xmath46 .",
    "\\4 ) according to the technique @xcite we will increase @xmath47 by 1 until some stop condition is reached , and repeat actions from step 3 ) .",
    "we determine parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 for one periodic at each step based on functional ( [ eq:21 ] ) minimum , using all the previous periodics coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53and parameters @xmath44 determined at previous steps .",
    "the only problem for using this approach is to choose correct stop condition ( we could increase @xmath47 up to infinity ) .",
    "lets analyze the problem of stop condition more detailed .",
    "there are at least two close but not similar approaches for solving this task . of couse",
    "we are ordering parameters by their effectivity ( energy of corresponding model component ) .",
    "approach 1 , or description aproach : to obtain a maximal accuracy for description of the data .",
    "it is used most frequently .",
    "it is clear , that when using large enough set of periodical functions , we could approximate almost any function as accurate as required .",
    "the most effective way to demonstrate it is fourier transform , that completes this task exactly .",
    "that is why in this approach the number of periodics could not be limited by the stated condition - we always could add next periodic and obtain higher accuracy of the model .",
    "so usually one could limit number of periodics by hands ( for example - calculate only 3 , 5 or 10 periodics ) or stop when amplitude of periodic becomes lower than somehow defined noise of the data .",
    "approach 2 , or prediction approach : to obtain a maximal accuracy for prediction of the data .    in opposite to the description approach , for prediction approach we should divide dataset into two non - intersecting intervals - analysis interval and prediction interval .",
    "all the model coefficients are defined from the analysis interval , but stop condition is defined from prediction interval , to the accuracy at prediction interval would be as effective as possible .",
    "this approach automatically limits number of periodics by not taking noise components into consideration .",
    "it is clear , that due to data noise , non - stationarity of the data and effects not included into the model an error will start to increase after the number of periodics exceeds some value . while the number of periodics less than this border number , the model remains adequate .",
    "when it exceeds this border number , the model becomes inadequate .",
    "there are at least two ways to calculate this stop condition within prediction approach .",
    "the first way is to stop when first local minimum of the error is reached at prediction set ( absolute stop condition ) .",
    "the second way is to stop when a local minimum of relation between error on prediction set and error on analysis set is reached ( relative stop condition ) .",
    "we will use the second variant for analysis of irkutsk data in prediction approach .",
    "for making the model the data from irkutsk digisonde dps-4 @xcite has been analyzed .",
    "the data covers more than 4 years , from 2003 till 2007 . from the data analysis there",
    "was excluded the most magneticaly disturbed periods with @xmath54 .",
    "the experimental data for electron density logarithm , averaged by days , are shown at fig.1 .",
    "fig.1 logarithm of electron density , averaged over 24 hours for heights 120 - 240 km .",
    "irkutsk digisonde data .",
    "even from the shown data it is clear that the modulation model for electron density is a very good approximation : as one can see , the variations with different periods look independent and have amplitudes independent on time ( in average ) .    for testing the technique we have divided the whole set fo the data into two subsets : analyze set - 2003 - 2006 years and prediction set - 2007 year .    at fig.2 the comparison between experiment and description model",
    "the model shown at fig.2 has been built without any additional periodics ( @xmath46 ) . at table 1",
    "the accuracy of this model over the two different sets - analyze and prediction ones ( columns 2 - 3 ) is shown .",
    "as one can see , the accuracy for prediction set is a little bit higher than for analyze set .",
    "it looks strange , but could be explained : absolute values of the electron density decreases with time , as can be seen from the fig.2 ( 2007 year is close to solar activity minimum ) .",
    "the order of density changes is about 30% and this corresponds to the observed difference between prediction and analyze sets accuracy .",

    "also one can see that accuracy of description model is increased with increasing number of parameters ( columns 2,4 ) .",
    "but , over prediction set of the data ( not included into analysis ) the prediction model could make better accuracy than description model with big number of parameters ( columns 5,7 ) .",
    "so when making a model for good description of the ionospheric electron density variations we should take an exact set of parameters .",
    "both small number of parameters and big number of parameters could increase the error when using it over prediction set of the data , i.e. when using the model for prediction purposes .    from the analysis one could also see that with increasing of the height the number of additional periodical variations that should be taken into account ( column 8) increases .",
    "in the paper the step - by - step principles for making local model of electron density ( [ eq:19 ] ) are described .",
