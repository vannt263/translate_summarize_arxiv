    "pushing the resolution limits of light microscopy , and understanding optical phenomena on scales below the diffraction limit , has been the driving force of what is known today as nano - optics  @xcite . to overcome this limit ,",
    "most of the early work was focused on near - field optical microscopy and related techniques  @xcite . however , in recent years , new concepts in fluorescence microscopy have pushed the resolution of far - field imaging down to the nanometer range  @xcite .",
    "most of these methods  @xcite rely on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers , that are isolated from one another on the basis of one or more distinguishing optical characteristics , or by selective or random activation of a bright and a dark state  @xcite .",
    "determining the location of an isolated fluorescent marker is only limited by photon noise , and not by the diffraction barrier .",
    "a key issue affecting these subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters .",
    "taking advantage of the transparency of cells , fluorescence microscopy uniquely provides noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and allows the detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging",
    ". however , certain biological tissues or soft - matter systems ( such as foams or colloidal suspensions ) look turbid due to intense scattering of photons traveling through them  @xcite .",
    "the image formed at a given point in the observation plane consists in a superposition of multiple fields , each arising from a different scattering sequence in the medium .",
    "this gives rise to a chaotic intensity distribution with numerous bright and dark spots known as a speckle pattern , producing a blurred image carrying no apparent information about the source position  @xcite .",
    "techniques to measure the distance between individual nano - objects without actually imaging their position exist  @xcite , fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) being the most widespread example  @xcite .",
    "it relies on the near - field energy transfer between two fluorophores ( donor and acceptor ) emitting at different wavelengths .",
    "the fret signal ( _ e.g. _ the ratio between the intensities emitted by the donor and the acceptor at different wavelengths ) depends on the donor - acceptor distance in the range @xmath0  nm . as such , it is not very sensitive to scattering problems .",
    "however , determining distances between two emitters in the range of 10 to 500  nm in a scattering medium still remains a challenging problem , not accessible either by fluorescence microscopy or fret techniques .",
    "our main goal here is to introduce a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment , based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light .",
    "this is an issue of much interest , for example , in the study of conformational changes in biomolecules in living tissues . sensing the distance between two incoherent sources in a complex medium",
    "could also provide an alternative to green s function retrieval techniques based on the correlations of the isotropic ambient noise measured at two receivers  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a method to capture the interaction between two identical sources in a scattering environment , based only on the measurement of intensity fluctuations .",
    "the principle of the method is schematically illustrated in fig .  1 , and is based on the analysis of the intensity - intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources .",
    "this approach permits , in principle , to monitor the relative distance between the sources in the range 10 - 500 nm , with a precision that is not limited by diffraction , but by the microstructure of the scattering medium . in application to green s function retrieval in complex media , the approach replaces the two - point field - field correlation of the background noise by a measurement at a single point of the intensity noise due to the two fluctuating sources .",
    "this might simplify the technique , in particular at visible or near - ir frequencies where time - domain field - field correlations are not easy to measure .",
    "the result in this paper also illustrate the fact that multiple scattering , that had long been considered as an unavoidable nuisance , can actually enhance the performance of sensing , imaging and communication techniques  @xcite , as already demonstrated in the context of spatio - temporal focusing by time reversal  @xcite , wavefront shaping of multiply scattered waves  @xcite , or improvement of information capacity of telecommunication channels  @xcite .",
    "we consider two point sources of light ( electric dipoles ) located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a disordered medium .",
    "the sources are characterized by their electric dipole moments @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that are fluctuating quantities of the form @xmath5 \\exp(-i\\omega t ) { { \\bf u}}_k$ ] with @xmath6 a slowly varying random phase , @xmath7 a complex amplitude and @xmath8 a unit vector defining the orientation of the dipole moment .",
    "this corresponds to a classical model for a quasi - monochromatic temporally incoherent source , such as a fluorescent source emitting at frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the two sources are uncorrelated ( or mutually incoherent ) , so that @xmath10\\exp[-i\\phi_2(t)]}=0 $ ] , where the bar denotes averaging over the fluctuations of the sources . using the ( dyadic ) green function @xmath11 of the disordered medium ,",
    "the electric fields at any point @xmath12 can be written  : @xmath13 the intensity associated to this field is a time fluctuating and spatially varying quantity that forms a time - dependent speckle pattern .",
    "let us first consider the total power @xmath14 emitted by the two sources .",
    "it reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a sphere with radius @xmath17 that encloses the disordered medium and @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum . for a _ non",
    "absorbing _ medium , the following relation can be derived from the vector form of green s second identity  @xcite ( the frequency dependence in the green function is dropped for simplicity ) : @xmath19 { { \\bf p}}_2^ * \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : green_identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : field_general]-[eq : green_identity ] ) , we obtain @xmath20 where the notation @xmath21 { { \\bf u}}_{j^\\prime}$ ] has been introduced for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we first assume that a temporal averaging over the fluctuations of the sources can be performed , in one configuration of the disordered medium ( frozen disorder ) .",
    "the fluctuation time scale of the emitted power can be associated to the coherence time , as usually defined for partially coherent sources  @xcite . for fluorescent sources ,",
    "this time is on the order of the lifetime @xmath22 of the excited state . for emission in the visible range , expected orders of magnitude are @xmath23 ns for dye molecules or quantum dots , and @xmath24s for rare - earth ions .",
    "the averaged power @xmath25 is simply the sum of the averaged power emitted by each source independently , since the terms with @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p2 ] ) vanish upon time averaging .",
    "it reads as = ( |p_1|^2 _ 11 + |p_2|^2 _ 22 ) [ eq : pmoy ] where @xmath27 \\mathrm{im } g_{jj}$ ] is the electric part of the local density of states ( ldos ) at point @xmath28  @xcite .",

    "is known to enter the expression of field - field spatial correlations in random fields , such as blackbody radiation or volume speckle patterns  @xcite , the description of time - reversed fields  @xcite , and is at the core of green s function retrieval techniques based on ambient noise correlations  @xcite .",
    "it is proportional to the cross density of states ( cdos ) , that was introduced in a different context for the description of spatial coherence in complex systems  @xcite .",
    "physically , the cdos counts the number of photonic eigenmodes connecting two points ( in our case the source points ) at a given frequency  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the cdos connecting @xmath31 to @xmath28 is given by @xmath32 \\mathrm{im } g_{jk}$ ]  @xcite . using the cdos , and assuming that the two sources have the same amplitude ( @xmath33 ) , the variance of the total emitted power can be rewritten as @xmath34 this equation is the first result in this paper .",
    "it provides a direct relationship between the temporal fluctuations of the total power emitted by two incoherent sources and the cdos connecting the source points in an arbitrary environment .",
    "this suggests that a retrieval of the amplitude of the cdos ( or equivalently of the imaginary of the green function at two different points ) is possible in a structured medium from a measurement of temporal fluctuations of the emitted power emerging from two incoherent sources .",
    "such a measurement would resemble the green function retrieval from ambient noise correlations , based on the relationship between field - field correlations and the imaginary part of the green function given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , initially introduced in the context of electromagnetic thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the generality of this relationship , also valid for field fluctuations in speckle patterns  @xcite , has stimulated the development of green s function retrieval techniques in acoustics , seismology or with low - frequency electromagnetic waves  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the statistical isotropic ambient noise is detected by two receivers , while in the method suggested here the green function is encoded in the noise due to the fluctuations of the two sources .",
    "the possibility to measure power fluctuations instead of field - field correlations might be an advantage for electromanetic green s function retrieval in the visible or near - ir frequency range .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : varp_time_2 ] ) also shows that the power fluctuations encode the interdistance between the sources . at this stage , since the cdos @xmath35 is specific to the sample under study and unknown , changes in power fluctuations could reflect changes in the interdistance , but the interdistance could not be determined without solving a difficult inverse problem .",
    "we will see how the problem can be simplified in the presence of multiple scattering in a disordered medium by peforming an ensemble averaging over the configurations of disorder .",
    "we now assume that in addition to a temporal averaging over the fluctuations of the sources , an average over the configurations of the disordered medium can be performed .",
    "a specific situation would be that of sources embedded in a dynamic medium , with configurational changes occurring on a time scale much larger than the characteristic time of the fluctuations of the sources .",
    "an equivalent situation is that of sources moving inside a frozen disordered medium , also on a sufficiently large time scale , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "if both the sources and the disordered medium are fixed ( i.e. the medium itself does not fluctuate ) , an artificial configurational averaging process could be induced by an external moving diffuser surrounding the medium , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . in all these situations both averaging processes can be performed independently and subsequently .",
    "the ( temporal ) variance of the total emitted power averaged over the configurations of the disordered medium is readily obtained from eq .",
    ": @xmath36 where we use the notation @xmath37 for configurational averaging .        in practice",
    ", it is often convenient to work with normalized statistical quantities . for later convenience",
    ", we can introduce the contrast of the power fluctuations , that we define as _",
    "[ eq : def_sigmap ] let us point out again the specific use of two non - commuting averaging processes in this definition , one over the temporal fluctuations of the sources and subsequently one over the configurations of the disordered medium . from eqs .   and",
    ", the power contrast can be written in terms of the ldos and cdos , leading to _",
    "[ eq : expr_sigmap ] in the next section we will derive a simple relationship between the power contrast @xmath38 and the speckle contrast @xmath39 deduced from the radiated intensity measured in a single direction , or equivalently at a single point in the far field speckle pattern .",
    "a measurement of the total emitted power @xmath14 requires a detection integrated over @xmath40 steradians .",
    "measuring fluctuations of the intensity radiated in a given direction , or intensity correlations between two different directions , could be a more convenient approach in practice .",
    "the time - averaged far - field intensity emerging in a given direction @xmath41 , per unit solid angle , and for a polarization state @xmath42 , is given by & = & + [ inocros ] where @xmath43 is the intensity radiated by the point source @xmath44 .",
    "the latter reads as i_j(*u * ) = _ r r^2 |*e*_*g*(*r*,*r*_j ) p_j * u*_j|^2 [ ijsigma ] with @xmath45 .",
    "the configurational average of the ( time averaged ) total emitted power and fluctuations can be rewritten as & = & _ 4 * u*[exact1 ] + & = & _ ^ _ 4 * u * * u*^ [ exact2 ] where @xmath46 means integration over the solid angle , @xmath47 runs over the two orthogonal polarization states in the far field , and @xmath48 .",
    "we now assume that the radiated field is a random statistically isotropic field , under the only constraints given by eqs .   and .",
    "in this case one has @xmath49 and = ( 1 + _ ^ _ * u**u*^ ) [ avip1ip1 ] where @xmath50 is the usual kronecker delta and @xmath51 is a kronecker delta with respect to detection angles .",
    "the derivation of eq .   is given in appendix a.    at this stage , it is worth noticing that relation between the speckle intensity - intensity correlation function and the fluctuations of the total emitted power is the origin of the so - called @xmath52 correlation known for a speckle produced by a single source  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the particular case of a single source at @xmath1 ( @xmath53 ) that does not fluctuate in time , the normalized intensity - intensity correlation function @xmath54 follows directly from eq . and",
    "is given by c(*u*,;*u*^,^ ) & = & -1 + & = & c_0 + ( c_0 + 1)_^ _ * u**u*^ [ c1]where c_0 & = & is the normalized variance of the ldos at the position of the source , that is at the origin of the infinite - range @xmath52 contribution to the speckle correlation function  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a single source , eq .   provides another way of deriving the well - known results related to the @xmath52 correlation .",
    "moreover , from eq . , the speckle contrast ( defined as the normalized variance of the intensity in a specific direction and a given polarization channel @xmath47 ) is given by = 1 + 2 c_0 a result already obtained by shapiro  @xcite , based on a microscopic diagrammatic approach for scalar waves .",
    "this result leads to non - universal corrections to the rayleigh statistical distribution of the intensity in speckle patterns produced by multiple scattering  @xcite .    for two fluctuating sources , assuming again that configurational changes in the disordered medium occur on time scales larger than the characteristic time of the source fluctuations",
    ", we also have [ the derivation is similar to that leading to eq .",

    "\\label{eq : fluct_iu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation shows that the intensities corresponding to two different speckle spots ( @xmath58 ) in the angular speckle pattern formed by two incoherent point sources are strongly correlated , with a correlation given by the fluctuations @xmath59 of the cdos .",
    "we end up with the surprising result that for two incoherent sources a cross - term survives averaging , and induces infinite range correlations in the speckle pattern .",
    "this correlation is formally very similar to that given by the @xmath52 contribution in the case of a single source , the fluctuations of the cdos replacing the fluctuations of the ldos .",
    "since the cdos is a two - point quantity , connecting in this specific situation the two source points , the speckle correlations encode the distance between the two sources .",
    "another implication of eq .",
    "is that in the presence of multiple scattering , cdos fluctuations can be accessed from measurements of the directional intensity , and not only from measurements of the total power @xmath14 as suggested initially by eq .  .",
    "more precisely , we will now show that the speckle contrast measured in a single speckle spot ( hereafter denoted by @xmath60 ) contains the same information as the contrast @xmath61 in eq .",
    ", that assumed a measurement of the total emitted power . to proceed , we define the speckle contrast for a detection in a given polarization channel @xmath47 as @xmath62 in a similar way as the contrast of the total emitted power in eq .  . from eq .  , and the relation = one immediatly obtains _",
    "s= = _ p [ sc2 ] or equivalently _",
    "[ scfinal ] this equation is the second important result in this paper .",
    "it shows that for two incoherent sources in a disorder medium , the speckle contrast measured in a single speckle spot , and computed from both temporal averaging over the fluctuations of the sources _ and _ configurational averaging over disorder , is proportional to @xmath63 that characterizes the fluctuations of the cdos connecting the two sources.this means that the information on the interdistance between the sources is encoded in the speckle contrast @xmath60 measured at a single point .",
    "changes in the speckle contrast could therefore be used to detect changes in the interdistance between the two sources .",
    "compared to a measurement of the total emitted power @xmath14 , a measurement of the speckle contrast @xmath39 would require a simpler instrumentation , but at the cost of a substantial reduction of the signal level .",
    "note that a parallel detection of the fluctuations in several speckle spots could be performed using a ccd camera . in practice , a compromise between simplicity in instrumentation and signal - to - noise ratio should be found .",
    "the contrast in eq .",
    "( [ scfinal ] ) would decrease to zero when increasing the interdistance .",
    "this change occurs on a range given by the width of the cdos ( green function ) considered as a function of the interdistance @xmath64 .",
    "this width depends on the microscopic structure of the disordered medium , providing in principle resolution capabilities beyond the free - space diffraction limit .",
    "the determination of the absolute value of the interdistance from the speckle contrast would require an expression of @xmath63 .",
    "the crucial issue in this case is to find the expression of @xmath65 in a disordered medium .",
    "this can be done at least in the weak scattering limit , as discussed in the next section .",
    "another consequence of eq .",
    "( [ scfinal ] ) , or eq .  , is that it provides a way to measure @xmath66 in a complex medium from the speckle noise recorded at a single point , which in the context of green s function retrieval might provide an alternative to the two - point field - field correlation technique , as discussed previously in section ii .",
    "when the sources are embedded in a weakly disordered , homogeneous and isotropic medium , it is possible to give an explicit approximate expression of the fluctuations of the cdos @xmath67 \\langle ( \\mathrm{im } g_{12})^2 \\rangle$ ] . in the limit @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the effective refractive index , @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 the wavelength in vacuum ) and @xmath72 the boltzmann scattering mean free path , the averaged green function is given by the well known result for homogeneous and isotropic media and we can write @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the effective wavenumber .",
    "the description of the scattering medium by a complex effective wavenumber breaks down when the distance @xmath76 between the emitters approaches the size of the homogeneities ( more precisely the correlation length of disorder , see the discussion in ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although this might look like a severe limitation , this approximation is in practice very robust and has been shown to model accurately light diffusion through biological tissues .",
    "to lowest order , we can further approximate @xmath77 which , from eqs .  , or , and provides an explicit expression of the intensity correlation function , or the speckle contrast , in terms of the relative distance between the sources .",
    "such an explicit expression should be of practical interest , e.g. , for the sensing of the interdistance between emitters embedded in biological tissues .",
    "let us point out that in terms of the detection of _ changes _ in the interdistance ( without measuring its absolute value ) , the method suggested in this paper does not requite any explicit expression of @xmath63 and relies only on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : varp_time_2 ] ) , ( [ eq : expr_sigmap ] ) or ( [ scfinal ] ) .",
    "the results derived in this paper suggest the intriguing possibility that intensity measurements at only one point in a speckle pattern produced by two incoherent sources can provide information about the relative distance between the sources .",
    "moreover , this information is in principle not limited by diffraction .",
    "it can be extracted from the speckle contrast @xmath60 obtained after a proper time and configurational averaging process .",
    "the results also suggests an alternative approach to the green function retrieval technique . in the later the statistical isotropic ambient noise",
    "is detected by two receivers , while in the method suggested here the green function is encoded in the noise due to two fluctuating incoherent sources measured at a single point .",
    "finally , let us note that for fluorescent emitters , the quantum optical equivalent of eqs .  , or might be established in terms of decay rate or photocount statistics of a coupled system , and fluctuations could be associated with super - radiant and sub - radiant states .",

    "<S> the intensity - intensity correlation function and the speckle contrast , obtained after proper temporal and configurational averaging , encode the relative distance between the two sources . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the intriguing possibility that intensity measurements at only one point in a speckle pattern produced by two incoherent sources can provide information about the relative distance between the sources , with a precision that is not limited by diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> the theory also suggests an alternative approach to green s function retrieval technique , where the correlations of the isotropic ambient noise detected by two receivers are replaced by a measurement at a single point of the noise due to two fluctuating incoherent sources . </S>"
