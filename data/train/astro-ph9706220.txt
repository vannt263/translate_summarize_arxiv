    "identifying the spindown products of rotation - powered pulsars is a long standing problem in astrophysics .",
    "recent observations of high energy emission from young pulsars ( eg .",
    "fierro 1996 ) and improvement in emission models ( eg . romani 1996 ) show that up to a few @xmath1% of the spindown power can be ascribed to observed photons . in most cases , the remaining power in particles and unobserved",
    "radiation still needs to be identified .",
    "the wind of energetic particles and fields emitted from spin - powered pulsars is most easily observed when it is confined .",
    "such post - shock , or ` plerionic ' emission has long been associated with sources such as the crab and vela pulsars and with similar filled - center remnants such as 3c58 , presumably containing young pulsars .",
    "the discovery of bow shock nebulae around a number of pulsars has provided a further opportunity to study pulsar winds .",
    "these nebulae generally occur when the pulsar is either long - lived , with a low magnetic field b and a short spin period , or when it has a large space velocity ; these properties allow escape from the pulsar s parent supernova remnant while it retains substantial spindown power .",
    "the pulsar wind then shocks against the ambient ism .",
    "these objects are most prominent as h@xmath2 nebulae , first discovered around the millisecond pulsar psr 1957 + 20 ( kulkarni and hester 1988 , see also aldcroft , romani and cordes 1992 ) .",
    "a similar bow shock is seen around the 5 ms pulsar psr j0437 - 4715 ( bell , bailes and bessel 1993 ) and cordes , romani and lundgren ( 1993 , crl ) have detected an h@xmath2 nebula around the high velocity , slow spin pulsar psr 2224 + 65 .",
    "high energy observations of these pulsar wind nebulae ( pwns ) can place key constraints on the pulsar particle output .",
    "models of the crab nebula ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) , for example indicate that the bulk of the spindown    -1.25em power is carried off in an @xmath3 wind with @xmath4 .",
    "arons and tavani ( 1993 ) described the expected high energy emission from wind shocks in the psr 1957 + 20 system , focusing on a wind model including a massive baryonic component . using rosat _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter _ ( pspc ) observations of psr 1957 + 20 , kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were able to extract general constraints on the @xmath3 content of the pulsar wind .",
    "a trail of soft x - ray emission behind the nearby pulsar psr1929 + 10 , discovered in rosat pspc data by d. helfand and described by wang , li and begelman ( 1993 ) , is also a likely product of pulsar wind - ism interaction .",
    "finally the interaction of pulsar winds with companion stellar winds can also produce a bow shock geometry .",
    "for example , psr 1259 - 63 in an eccentric orbit around a be companion provides the opportunity of studying the pulsar wind interactions under changing conditions ( arons and tavani 1994 ) .",
    "asca observations of non - thermal x - rays ( see hirayama 1996 , and references therein ) have in particular provided important constraints on the particle energy and luminosity .",
    "we describe here rosat _ high resolution imager _ ( hri ) observations of the pwn trailing psr 2224 + 65 , the ` guitar nebula ' .",
    "this is followed by a description of the bow shock flow geometry and a discussion of the origin of the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the guitar nebula is particularly interesting because the pulsar itself is relatively normal , but the high velocity and peculiar shock geometry of the system provide opportunities to probe the pulsar wind interactions under conditions quite different than those found in other pwn . in particular ,",
    "the small bow shock scale allows soft x - ray constraints on electron energies similar to those inferred for the crab pulsar .",
    "we proposed rosat hri observations of psr 2224 + 65 to detect emission in the shocked wind and ism and to constrain the physics of the post - shock flow .",
    "exposures were obtained in 7 observation intervals during july 13  25 , 1994 . with 36,894s of dead - time corrected exposure centered on psr 2224 + 65",
    "we were able to detect coronal emission from @xmath5 bright stars in the field .",
    "cross correlation with optical frames registered to deep h@xmath2 images showing the guitar nebula allowed us to ` boresight ' the hri data .",
    "three _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) guide stars ( gsc 472 - 144 , -188 , -232 ) were detected with standard processing in the center of the hri frame and were used for final alignment of the x - ray and optical images to @xmath6 .",
    "this allowed a very sensitive search for emission from psr 2224 + 65 and the guitar nebula .",
    "no x - ray emission was detected from psr 2224 + 65 itself , with the 2 counts detected within 4@xmath7 of the pulsar position entirely consistent with the 2.02 counts expected from the mean background rate .",
    "however an x - ray excess was apparent in the vicinity of the h@xmath2 nebula .",
    "we have defined an aperture of half width @xmath8 following the outline of the edge - brightened guitar shape .",
    "if the x - ray emission is confined to the limb , then this contour will contain 90% of the source counts ; if the bubble interior has x - ray emission , the omitted flux will be slightly larger .",
    "this contour contains 31 counts at the guitar position in excess of the 58 counts expected from the mean background rate ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is formally a @xmath9 detection . to check the significance , we summed counts in our nebula - shaped aperture at various independent positions in the hri image , after applying vignetting corrections and excluding regions where significant point sources ( generally identified stars ) were found in the standard pros processing .",
    "the histogram of the resulting excess counts shows that the true guitar position has the largest excess . estimating the envelope of the count fluctuations again gives a significance slightly in excess of @xmath10 .",
    "the guitar nebula thus emits soft x - rays with a count rate of @xmath11counts / s in the rosat band .",
    "the flux seems to follow the limb of the guitar , concentrating in the forward facing parts of the nebula , but starting significantly behind the pulsar itself .",
    "some crude spectral information is available from the pha energy channels in the hri detector .",
    "we find that the excess guitar counts are soft , with a median pha channel of 6 .",
    "the distribution is only slightly harder than that of the mean background counts , but also contains an excess of counts in pha channels 0 - 1 , suggesting uv flux near the source .",
    "this ` spectrum ' is clearly different from some of the stronger sources identified with bright stars in the optical ; these have median pha channels of 8 - 9 and very few counts below channel 5 .",
    "unfortunately , with the very low count rate and lack of calibration , quantitative results can not be extracted from this hardness information .",
    "the implied x - ray luminosity is sensitive to the parent spectrum and the absorption . from the pulsar dispersion measure 35.3@xmath12 and an assumed @xmath13",
    "we infer a column density @xmath14 .",
    "this assumed @xmath15 is very similar to that inferred for psr 2334 + 61 ( becker , brazier & trmper 1996 ) at a similar direction and @xmath16 .",
    "the balmer decrement in the guitar nebula itself suggests @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath18 . however , because the balmer ratios in non - radiative shocks are uncertain ( chevalier , kirshner and raymond 1980 ; raymond 1991 ) , we adopt here @xmath19 for the absorbing column . with this @xmath20 and a photon number index of @xmath21",
    "we infer an x - ray flux of @xmath22 ( 0.01 - 10kev ) ; for @xmath18 the flux is 50% higher .",
    "this represents @xmath23 of the spindown luminosity .",
    "as described in crl , the guitar nebula is an h@xmath2-emitting bow shock trailing the slow spin ( p=0.68s ) intermediate age ( @xmath24y ) pulsar psr 2224 + 65 . with",
    "an interferometrically determined proper motion giving a space velocity of @xmath25cm / s ( with @xmath26 the angle between the velocity and the plane of the sky ) and a dispersion measure distance estimate of @xmath27 kiloparsecs ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) this object has arguably the highest space velocity of any known star .",
    "with this velocity the standoff of the pulsar wind bow shock is especially small for this nebula .",
    "the pulsar spindown luminosity @xmath28 is believed to power a relativistic wind which shocks against the ism of density @xmath29 , giving a momentum balance standoff of the contact discontinuity at the bow shock nose of @xmath30 the balmer emission of the pulsar wind nebulae is caused by neutral ism atoms drifting into the shocked gas and suffering collisional excitation or charge exchange into excited states of the post - shock ions . accordingly",
    "h@xmath2 arises in a thin sheet behind the ism shock , upstream from the contact discontinuity ( chevalier , kirshner and raymond 1980 ) .",
    "a detailed model for the bow shock flow is not available , but aldcroft , romani & cordes ( 1992 ) estimated that the h@xmath2 apex lies at @xmath31 .",
    "this size was unresolved in ground based images of the guitar .",
    "hst _ wide field planetary camera _ ( wfpc2 ) h@xmath2 images of the nebula , however , show that the apex has the classic bow shock shape displayed by the psr 1957 + 32 and psr j0437 - 4715 nebulae .",
    "these data are described elsewhere ( cordes _ et al . _ in preparation ) . here",
    "we note only that while the pulsar , and hence the standoff angle , are not directly observed in the hst data , a fit to the bright h@xmath2 ridge of the bow shock allows us to measure the size of the bow shock and infer @xmath32 .",
    "wilkin ( 1996 ) has derived convenient analytic expressions for the geometry of a thin momentum - balance bow shock .",
    "assuming that the shock standoff at the apex scales proportionally for the rest of the bow wave , the scaled version of the momentum balance contact discontinuity curve gives the bow shock shape : @xmath33 where the pulsar is at the origin and position angle @xmath34 is measured from the pulsar velocity .",
    "the fit determines the origin and the overall scale , giving an inferred @xmath35 standoff angle as @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to a contact discontinuity scale @xmath37 cm which , with ( 1 ) gives an estimate of the pulsar distance as @xmath38 .",
    "ground - based palomar 200@xmath7 images ( figure 1 ) show that the shape of the @xmath35 nebula downstream from the _ hst _ resolved apex can be described as a @xmath39 tube ( the ` neck ' of the guitar ) connecting to a complex bubble that flares gradually to a diameter of @xmath40 some @xmath41 behind the pulsar .",
    "the waist in this bubble ( the guitar ` body ' ) may be due to ism density variations .",
    "the bubble also does not appear fully closed at the end opposite the pulsar . with the observed proper motion ,",
    "the pulsar traverses the guitar in @xmath42y .",
    "crl give the h@xmath2 flux of the head of the nebula as @xmath43 .",
    "this line flux implies that neutral h atoms enter the nebula head at @xmath44 . with the observed radius of @xmath45 , an ism neutral fraction @xmath46 and the measured pulsar proper motion",
    ", the nebula head should sweep up neutral h at @xmath47 .",
    "thus the observed line flux is in good accord with the hst constraints on the bow shock geometry for @xmath48 .",
    "the variation in nebula cross section can be understood from pressure balance arguments . behind the pulsar",
    "the outflowing wind drives the bow shock tail into the ism ; this stalls where the wind ram pressure balances the ism static pressure @xmath49 .",
    "well behind the pulsar the wind impacts at a shallow angle ; a characteristic position angle of @xmath50 gives a transverse pressure @xmath51 in a tube of radius @xmath52 arcseconds .",
    "thus we expect the ram pressure driven ` neck ' of the guitar to stall at a width @xmath53 .",
    "further downstream it is clear that the shocked pulsar wind is partly confined in the body of the guitar .",
    "this confinement may be aided by the increased ram pressure associated with expansion into a dense region toward the rear of the guitar , delimited by the horizontal filament in figure 1 . here",
    "the isotropic pressure of the shocked relativistic plasma @xmath54 comes into play .",
    "if the wind emitted during the time the pulsar crosses the guitar is fully confined in a tube of diameter @xmath55 and there is no cooling , the pressure is @xmath56 . in practice",
    "the back of the nebulae does not appear closed , so perhaps @xmath57 of this pressure obtains ; even with this pressure the bubble stalls with a characteristic radius @xmath58 .",
    "we thus have a consistent picture of the guitar bubble as a classic bow shock whose ram pressure stalls against the static ism pressure behind the pulsar ; the backflow in this neck should be mildly relativistic .",
    "further downstream , the shocked pulsar wind stalls and becomes partly confined .",
    "the shocked wind expands against the ism inflating the bubble to the observed @xmath40 diameter .",
    "we turn now to the interpretation of the lack of x - ray flux from psr 2224 + 65 and to the x - ray flux from the guitar nebula body .",
    "the non - detection of the pulsar is not surprising . at @xmath59y",
    "the expected surface temperature of @xmath60k from standard cooling models predicts a luminosity of @xmath61 and no significant hri flux .",
    "pulsars of similar age have been detected by rosat , eg .",
    "psr 1929 + 10 ( yancopoulos et al . 1994 ) and psr 0823 + 26 ( sun et al 1993 ) , but the emission from these nearby objects seems to be from a small heated polar cap ; scaled to psr 2224 + 65 s distance the polar cap flux of psr 1929 + 10 would contribute @xmath62 count in our exposure .",
    "the two plausible sources of the nebular x - ray emission are the shocked pulsar wind and the postshock ism .",
    "in contrast to the bow shocks around the slower pulsars psr 1957 + 20 and psr j0437 - 4715 , the large pulsar velocity here gives high @xmath63 in the shocked ism gas ; at the apex of the bow wave , the postshock ism temperature is @xmath64k .",
    "however , the small working surface resulting from the small @xmath32 means that the shock luminosity near the guitar nose is only @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , for a typical ism abundances and cooling rate @xmath66 , the characteristic cooling time @xmath67 is quite long , so little thermal emission is expected before adiabatic losses in the post - shock flow become significant .",
    "the absence of efficient cooling is supported by the balmer - dominated nebular spectrum at the apex ( crl ) which indicates that the shock is non - radiative ( chevalier , kirshner and raymond 1980 ) . along the body of the guitar , the continued expansion of the partly confined pulsar wind drives shock waves into the surrounding medium at @xmath68 .",
    "the implied shock luminosity along the guitar body is @xmath69 , with a postshock temperature of @xmath70k .",
    "although the cooling time for @xmath71 is comparable to the flow time through the nebula ( so that we might expect some thermal emission from the tail of the guitar ) , the effective temperature is too low to produce the observed hri count rate . even if the distance to psr 2224 + 65 is as large as 2kpc , prospects for thermal emission from the nebula are not much better . with @xmath72k",
    "our observed hri counts imply a thermal luminosity at 2 kpc of @xmath73 for @xmath74 and a raymond - smith thermal spectrum .",
    "however at these temperatures the cooling time is @xmath75s , so that radiation in the postshock flow is inefficient .",
    "thus unless @xmath76 and @xmath77 are large , @xmath20 is small and the cooling rate is significantly enhanced , thermal emission can not account for the observed hri flux .",
    "a more promising source is post - shock synchrotron cooling of the relativistic pulsar wind . in the ram - pressure balance region of the bow wave ,",
    "the energy dissipated in this shocked wind is larger than that in the shocked ism by @xmath78 .",
    "observations of the crab nebula plerion suggest that the pulsar wind is dominated by energetic @xmath3 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "these electrons radiate in the postshock field of the pulsar wind , @xmath81 g .",
    "et  al . _",
    "1992 were able to use the x - ray flux from the millisecond pulsar psr 1957 + 20 to limit the fraction of the pulsar spindown in @xmath3 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , assuming synchrotron emission at the companion shock and at the bow shock , respectively . with it",
    "s larger field and high velocity , psr 2224 + 65 s soft x - ray flux is most sensitive to intermediate electron energies , similar to those in the crab nebula . including the @xmath84 dependence of the pulsar wind @xmath85 we find that the synchrotron spectrum in the shocked wind has a peak energy @xmath86kev , so that closer than @xmath87 the charges will radiate in the rosat band .",
    "we expect the shocked pulsar wind to have a mildly relativistic backflow in the bow shock , with a characteristic flow time at a distance @xmath88 from the pulsar of @xmath89 .",
    "this is shorter than the synchrotron cooling time under these conditions , so that the efficiency is small @xmath90 .",
    "when the peak energy is well above the rosat threshold the observed flux will decrease somewhat ; since the synchrotron emissivity at energy @xmath91 scales as @xmath92 , the fraction of the radiation in the rosat band has the weak dependence @xmath93 . thus if a fraction @xmath94 of the spindown energy is carried off by charges of lorentz factor @xmath95 ,",
    "then including the cooling efficiency and the fraction of the spectrum in the rosat band , we get an observed x - ray luminosity from the wind shock within position angle @xmath34 of @xmath96^{2/3}\\gamma_7^{1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is determined from ( 2 ) . thus the emission should be concentrated toward the bow shock apex . because the wind can not cool effectively before the relativistic backflow carries it towards the body of the guitar , the total luminosity is small . with an @xmath21 spectrum and @xmath98 at 1kpc",
    ", we expect 2 counts from the shocked pulsar wind at the apex of the flow .",
    "above we have assumed that the field in the pulsar wind itself dominates @xmath85 in the post - shock region and that the flow is not confined .",
    "however , it appears that the pulsar wind is partly confined in the nebula . in addition turbulence in the shocked pulsar wind",
    "may increase @xmath85 up to equipartition values . at the shock apex @xmath99 , so that our previous estimates hold .",
    "however , @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) behind the pulsar the ram pressure associated with the sideways expansion of the guitar body at @xmath102 begins to exceed @xmath103 in the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "thus as the neck of the guitar merges into the body we expect that an equipartition field can reach @xmath104 g .",
    "the characteristic energy in this field @xmath105kev is large enough to contribute significant rosat emission . more importantly ,",
    "if the shocked wind is partly confined in this region , we expect @xmath106s . for @xmath107",
    "we get a synchrotron cooling time @xmath108s and about 30% of the shock energy radiated in the rosat band for @xmath109 .",
    "this gives an observed x - ray flux @xmath110 .",
    "thus to produce the observed x - rays , we require @xmath111 in @xmath112 particles . with the increased @xmath113",
    "inferred at 2kpc , cooling is even more efficient and we again infer @xmath114 .",
    "the x - ray emission observed from the bow shock created by psr 2224 + 65 represents @xmath115 of it s spindown power .",
    "although the pulsar s large velocity ensures that gas is heated to x - ray emitting temperatures near the bow wave , the cooling in the post - shock ism flow is inefficient .",
    "little of the observed flux can be contributed by the shocked ism .",
    "the location of the x - ray emission significantly downstream from the pulsar suggests that the most likely source of the flux is the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "however , to account for the observed flux we require this wind to be partly confined in the guitar body and that turbulence in the shocked wind flow can amplify the magnetic field to near equipartition vales .",
    "if these conditions obtain , the observed flux implies that @xmath116 of the pulsar spindown power is being emitted in @xmath3 with @xmath0 .",
    "our data then support the idea that a pair plasma with @xmath117 is a dominant component of the pulsar wind for normal non - recycled pulsars .",
    "such a wind is in reasonable accord with models of pulsar magnetosphere acceleration , but the pairs may also be accelerated in the post - shock region itself .",
    "in contrast the conditions inferred for the soft x - ray emission from psr 1929 + 10 s shock by wang , _ et  al . _",
    "suggest that @xmath118 pairs are responsible for the pspc photons ; it is perhaps significant that the flux from these pairs represents only @xmath119 of psr 1929 + 10 s spindown luminosity",
    ".    a more complete description of thermal and non - thermal emission in the guitar nebula will require detailed hydrodynamic models of the backflow in the postshock region .",
    "for example , raga , cabrit & canuto ( 1995 ) find that there is mixing of the shocked fluids in a bow shock flow .",
    "while the presence of the relativistic pulsar wind means that their sums are not directly applicable to psr 2224 + 65 , such mixing could affect the estimates of cooling time in the postshock flow . such modeling coupled with future high throughput x - ray observations",
    "could give important constraints on the pulsar wind in this unique system .",
