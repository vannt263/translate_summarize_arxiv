    "despite over three decades of intensive work , the nature of the low temperature phase of two - dimensional edwards - anderson ( ea ) @xcite model for spin glasses remains controversial .",
    "it is agreed that a phase transition occurs at zero temperature for a gaussian distribution of bonds ( gd ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , for a symmetric @xmath1 distribution or bimodal distribution ( bd ) of bonds , very convincing numerical evidence has been found that there is no transition at finite temperature @xcite . in most of these references , the authors do not use an order parameter for characterizing the phase transition . on the other hand , data arising from other contributions , which are based on the behavior of a standard overlapping order parameter , support the existence of a finite critical temperature @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the main purposes of this paper are the following : a ) to show that the disagreement pointed out in previous paragraph is related to the non - zero overlap of site - order parameters obtained for quite distinct energy valleys ; b ) to overcome this situation by proposing here a novel order parameter @xmath0 , which is quite drastic to characterize phases but still is general enough to coincide with usual descriptions of ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) systems ; c ) to apply @xmath0 to do a scaling analysis for two - dimensional ea systems including binder cumulant @xcite ; d ) to confirm the assumption of the zero - temperature phase transition for two - dimensional bd , thus reinforcing this result obtained by previously quoted authors ; and e ) to give a physical meaning to this result by using the grounds on which @xmath0 is based on .    the present work is organized as it follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and define a novel order parameter , @xmath0 , very useful for spin glasses and other frustrated systems .",
    "results of the simulation are presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "let us begin by very briefly introducing the system under study .",
    "ising spin @xmath3 occupies @xmath4 site of a two dimensional ( square for simplicity ) lattice . the interaction with the spin at site @xmath5",
    "is mediated by exchange interaction @xmath6 . in the absence of magnetic field ( which is the case for the scope of the present paper ) the hamiltonian of such system",
    "can then be written as @xmath7 where interactions @xmath8 are restricted to nearest neighbor couplings . in the ferromagnetic ( f ) ising model , @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "for the ea model , we will consider half of the bonds f , while the other half will be described by antiferromagnetic ( af ) bonds of the same magnitude , namely , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a sample is one of the possible random distributions of these mixed bonds . for simplicity spins",
    "take values @xmath14 , which can be equally denoted by their signs .",
    "now , let us consider a configuration @xmath15 defined by a collection of ordered spin orientations @xmath16 .",
    "the usual ea order parameter @xmath2 is built up by means of overlaps between two configurations @xmath15 and @xmath17 and takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the total number of spins .    for models in which the ground state is non degenerate after breaking ergodicity , such as the pure f case ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath21 values for the ground manifold ( t=0.0 ) is trivial and it is given by delta functions at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this also happens in general for all systems with non - degenerate ground level .",
    "but this also applies to gd , where local fields have all different values at different sites , leading to a true minimum energy for just one pair of opposite ground states .",
    "however , for the bd the local field assumes a few discrete values only , which necessarily means highly degenerate ground manifolds leading to @xmath24 , for a large number of possible pairs of ground states .",
    "this distribution will have two broad symmetric maxima but it will not vanish in the intermediate region @xcite .    on the other hand , a more detailed description based on a topological picture of the ground state of bd was presented @xcite .",
    "this framework allows us to define a state function with a clear physical meaning , which is a good candidate to be a new order parameter for a phase transition .",
    "in fact , it has been reported an important feature of the ground state , namely , at @xmath25 there exist clusters of solidary spins ( css ) preserving the magnetic memory of the system ( solidary spins maintain their relative orientation for all states of the ground manifold)@xcite .",
    "the main idea of this work is to characterize the nature of the low temperature phase through the css .",
    "let us consider a particular sample of any given size @xmath19 .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 any of the @xmath27 css of the sample ( @xmath28 runs from @xmath29 to @xmath27 ) .",
    "calculations begin recognizing all of the css of each sample belonging to a set of @xmath30 randomly generated samples of each size .",
    "this process is closely related to finding the so - called  diluted lattice \" that prevails after removing all frustrated bonds @xcite , so the algorithms designed for that purpose can also be used here .",
    "let us first pick any arbitrary ground state configuration denoted by an asterisk ( @xmath31 ) fixing one of the two possible relative orientations of the css , thus becoming a reference configuration .",
    "then a local overlap corresponding to the configuration @xmath15 in the @xmath32-th cluster , of size @xmath33 , can be defined as    @xmath34    where the sum runs over all spins in the cluster @xmath26 only .",
    "thus , @xmath35 indicates a fully ordered cluster ; otherwise @xmath36 .",
    "the magnetic order of the sample is characterized by the set of overlaps , namely , @xmath37 . under the occurrence of a phase transition ,",
    "the new set @xmath38 will determine uniquely the ergodic component of the reached phase .",
    "this fact is a required characteristic for a well behaved order parameter @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to define the new order parameter introduced in this paper .",
    "it is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , being @xmath41 , ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "from the definition it flows that for @xmath43 the average value of @xmath44 , namely , @xmath0 , should be @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath46 it should hold that @xmath47 , being @xmath48 for @xmath25 only .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath44 is a state function , which is an advantage over @xmath21 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqqab ] ) as an overlap between two configurations of the system .",
    "the calculation of the new order parameter @xmath44 requires the previous determination of the set of css for each considered sample .",
    "this procedure , which was performed by using the numerical scheme introduced in ref.@xcite , is a computational limitation for going to larger system sizes .",
    "once the ground manifold of each sample is completely characterized after this procedure , the numerical calculations converge very quickly by flipping the spins not present in the largest css only .",
    "the second run on each sample takes much less time than the first one that is needed to find all css .    in the f ising model",
    "there is a unique cluster of @xmath19 solidary parallel spins at @xmath25 .",
    "as it can be trivially demonstrated , eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) leads to the magnetization per spin , which is the natural order parameter of such system .",
    "similarly , for the af case we get the well - known order parameter defined as the magnetization difference between the two possible interpenetrating sublattices .",
    "finally , for gd , there also exists an unique css in the ground state and the phase transition occurring in the system is completely described by the new order parameter , eq.([op ] ) , as well .",
    "so the new parameter retains all the properties of the well - known non - degenerate systems .",
    "finally , the reduced fourth - order cumulant , introduced by binder @xcite , can be calculated as @xmath49}{3\\left [ \\langle m^2 \\rangle \\right ] ^2 } , \\label{bcumulant}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a given order parameter , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 $ ] mean the spin configuration ( thermal ) average and the bond configuration ( sample ) average , respectively . in general",
    ", the structure of the distribution of @xmath50 affects the behavior of the fourth - order binder cumulant .",
    "thus , for a trivial distribution , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as @xmath55 goes to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if the distribution is nontrivial , @xmath56 tends to a value @xmath57 lower than 1 , while @xmath58 tends to a value @xmath59 lower than @xmath60 upon decreasing temperature .",
    "distribution functions for @xmath61 and @xmath44 , were obtained for bd by using a standard simulated - tempering procedure . ]",
    "@xcite along with the well known glauber s dynamics @xcite . for illustration purposes , we perform calculations on @xmath62 samples of size 64 @xmath63 at different temperatures ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "( throughout this paper , @xmath66 without any loss of generality ) .",
    "the results corresponding to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are presented in fig .",
    "1 . as it is shown in part ( a ) , the distribution of the new order parameter , @xmath70 , exhibits a drastic behavior as @xmath55 decreases . in part ( b )",
    "it is shown how the corresponding curves for @xmath71 have a broad maximum over the plotted range and @xmath72 .",
    "these undesired characteristics for this order parameter remain even at low temperatures .    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath73 , built up from @xmath70 distribution , is presented for different lattice sizes ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 and each point was calculated by averaging over a set of 2000 samples . with the help of the inset , it is observed that the curves do not intersect each other as a direct indication of the absence of a phase transition for finite temperature , at least for the sizes considered here .",
    "eventually we are not free from finite size considerations yet as it has been recently proposed that at least samples with @xmath76 should be reached when conventional parameters are used @xcite . however , using a more drastic parameter like the one proposed here , a faster convergence towards large @xmath77 values is expected .",
    "it is clear that all curves go to @xmath60 as @xmath78 , which reinforces the robustness of eq.([op ] ) . on the other hand , this property is not followed by cumulants obtained from other overlapping order parameters .",
    "this is the case of fig .",
    "7 in ref.@xcite , where it is possible to think that the reported crossing of the cumulants of @xmath2 arises from the dependence of @xmath59 on size . in this contribution",
    ", the authors reported a critical temperature different from zero , @xmath79 .",
    "finite - size scaling @xcite predicts that all curves in a figure such as fig .",
    "2 , should collapse onto a single one when using @xmath80 as independent variable , being @xmath81 the critical temperature for the transition and @xmath82 an appropriate critical exponent . upon choosing @xmath83 and the exponent @xmath82",
    "is taken as @xmath84 , the standard universal behavior for @xmath73 is obtained as shown in fig .",
    "this is an independent confirmation of previously reported results @xcite .",
    "the following two parameters were also measured as each sample was solved exactly : ( a ) the mean fraction of spins , @xmath85 /n$ ] , belonging to any css ; and ( b ) the fraction of spins in the largest css @xmath86 /n$ ] , where @xmath87 is the number of spins in the largest css .",
    "4(a ) shows that while @xmath88 remains rather constant , @xmath89 clearly decreases with size and the stabilizing role of the largest css is lost .",
    "the average number of css @xmath90 $ ] as function of size was also measured , finding that @xmath90 $ ] grows linearly with @xmath19 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "for @xmath91 , say ( when small size effects do not play an important role ) , the following approximate law is obtained @xmath90\\approx 0.03n+0.60 $ ] .",
    "the size dependence of a possible spin - glass phase can be described in the following terms . for small sizes ( @xmath92 say ) most of solidary spins",
    "are grouped in one large cluster stabilizing a spin - glass phase .",
    "as size grows , the number of css increases linearly with @xmath19 ( or quadratically with @xmath77 ) , while the relative size of the largest css diminishes .",
    "this can be visualized as if the original lattice would break into portions of relatively smaller sizes , none of them large enough to stabilize a spin - glass phase .",
    "this is the reason for the numeric result of fig .",
    "2 , showing no intersection of curves for different sizes .",
    "if the same procedure used here for the symmetric case is applied to different concentrations of f and af bonds , a stable phase is found in the extremes of high and low concentrations of f bonds in correspondence with results already reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "as the relative concentration of f bonds varies the behavior of @xmath88 and @xmath90 $ ] is very similar to that shown in fig .",
    "however , @xmath89 tends to be constant for very asymmetric distributions of @xmath1 bonds .",
    "the last statement indicates the presence of an infinite css in the thermodynamical limit , which is associated to a stable phase .",
    "these results are not shown graphically in the present paper .",
    "a new order parameter @xmath0 has been introduced and applied to the study of magnetic systems .",
    "it proves to be particularly essential for characterizing degenerate systems such as ising - like models with bimodal distribution .",
    "parameter @xmath0 is well behaved , having all desired properties for a drastic order parameter .",
    "this behavior is based on the properties of css .",
    "when this order parameter is used for systems with bd , properties similar to order parameters for non - degenerate systems are found .",
    "then , the characterization of magnetic phases after using the scaling techniques of cumulants becomes unambiguous . in this way it was shown",
    "that the two - dimensional edwards - anderson model exhibits a phase transition at @xmath83 , with a critical exponent @xmath84 .",
    "the identification of all css for each sample is the bottleneck in the present computational scheme .",
    "this procedure is very time consuming for large lattice sizes . the extra time needed for finding all css",
    "is well paid by the better precision achieved in the characterization of the phase , and the elimination of overlaps in the new order parameter , thus making the identification of the ergodic valley reliable .    the characteristics of this new order parameter",
    "make it also useful for other frustrated systems , where large overlaps occur due to the complex energy valley .",
    "the extension of the use of the parameter @xmath0 to other kind of problems is clearly foreseen .",
    "for instance , it can be the key element @xmath93 to describe the phase diagram for the asymmetric distribution problem around the critical concentration of ferromagnetic ( or antiferromagnetic ) bonds of @xmath94 and @xmath95 to study the critical behavior of 3d ising spin glasses .",
    "this task requires serious improvements in the numerical techniques used in order to get access to large lattice sizes .",
    "work along this line is in progress .",
