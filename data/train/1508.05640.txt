    "this leads to the formation of correlated phases of matter  @xcite , this being useful for quantum simulation purposes  @xcite and quantum information processing ( qip ) applications .",
    "the degree of precision achieved with them so far , has allowed to achieved self - consistent light - matter states in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) inside an optical cavity  @xcite . using the dynamical properties of the light  @xcite the structural dicke phase transition",
    "was achieved forming a state with supersolid features  @xcite .",
    "however , the study of the full quantum regime of the system has been limited to few atoms  @xcite . as the light matter coupling",
    "is strongly enhanced in a high finesse optical cavity in a preferred wavelength , the atoms re - emit light comparable with the lasers used in the trapping process . as a consequence , an effective long - range ( nonlocal ) interaction emerges driven by the cavity field .",
    "it is now experimentally possible to access the regime where light - matter coupling is strong enough and the cavity parameters allow to study the formation of quantum many - body phases with cavity decay rates of mhz  @xcite and khz  @xcite .",
    "the light inside the cavity can be used to control the formation of many - body phases of matter even in a single cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "this leads to several effects yet to be observed due to the dynamical properties of light  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that multimode atomic density patterns can emerge , even their coherences can become structured and light - matter quantum correlations can control the formation of correlated phases .",
    "thus , a plethora of novel quantum phases due to the imprinting of structure by design in the effective light - induced interaction occurs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to light - scattering  @xcite , homogenous quantum many - body phases can be measured by matter wave scattering  @xcite and dynamical structure factors can be obtained via homodyne detection  @xcite .",
    "recently , density ordering has been achieved with classical atoms  @xcite .",
    "further , multimode cavities extend the range of quantum phases even further  @xcite .",
    "therefore , by carefully tuning system parameters and the spatial structure of light , one can design with plenty of freedom the quantum many - body phases that emerge .",
    "the quantum nature of the potential seen by the atoms changes the landscape of correlated quantum many - body phases beyond classical optical lattice setups . very recently",
    "an optical lattice in an optical cavity has been realised  @xcite and self - oganized mott - insultator phases have been achieved  @xcite    moreover , the interplay between short range processes , such as on - site interactions and tunneling , and long - range cavity induced interactions can change significantly the properties of the light in the system . as these processes compete to optimise the energy in the system , the back - action of the matter affects the light generating nonclassical features  @xcite .",
    "we show how such nonclassical effects of the light inside the cavity arise due to the emergence of structured quantum phases of matter .",
    "this can be traced back to the particular structure of the full light - matter state , which we construct beyond the limit where the light can be integrated out ( adiabatically eliminated )  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the explicit form of the light - matter state of the system and deriving the effective matter hamiltonian incorporating the effect of light at the quantum level is a difficult problem .",
    "we provide an alternative to those methods that allows for the construction of the effective hamiltonian , where the effect of local processes ( regular atomic tunneling and on site interaction ) is both considered in the properties of the light .",
    "the series of terms that arise , compose different hierarchies of light - induced interactions in addition to the adiabatic limit .",
    "this leads to a new effective hamiltonian where the effect of local processes , such as tunneling and on - site interactions , and the global structure imprinted by the light is relevant .",
    "we use the technique of canonical transformations constructing the set of unitary operators to remove the non - diagonal terms due to the light  @xcite .",
    "the underlying symmetries broken by design by pumping light into the system modify the structure of both matter and light and the competition between global and local processes are the origin of nonclassical features .",
    "we find the effective matter hamiltonian and that the full light - matter state is a superposition of squeezed coherent states .",
    "these depend on the emergent quantum many - body phases of matter the system supports and their structural properties .",
    "we demonstrate how the quantum ( quadratures ) and classical ( amplitude ) properties of the light encode information about the strongly correlated phases of matter . as a corollary of our results , we find the conditions to optimise quadrature light squeezing in the system and the effect of the structure induced to the matter .",
    "thus , our work will foster the design of this kind of states and their possible application towards quantum multimode systems in the analogous interdisciplinary field of optomechanics  @xcite . towards possible applications , there is an active interest in achieving large light squeezing in optomechanical systems where relevant achievements have already been made  @xcite .",
    "recently , using trapped ions  @xcite superpositions of squeezed states have been achieved as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "additionally , stationary entanglement of photons and atoms in a cavity has been studied  @xcite , seeding patters via the cavity field  @xcite and quantum control projection  @xcite , opening the venue for applications on qip . beyond the quantum properties of light and matter",
    ", we find the effective master equation that describes the evolution of the system .",
    "this enables the possibility to study the effect of measurement back - action and its direct interplay with local processes .",
    "additionally , this can be used for state preparation using state projection via measurement back - action  @xcite , while engineering of non - trivial correlated quantum states is possible  @xcite , and opens the possibility to optimise nonclassical properties of light .",
    "the system consists of atoms trapped in an ol inside single - mode cavity with the mode frequency @xmath0 and decay rate @xmath1 in off - resonant scattering .",
    "the pump light has amplitude @xmath2 ( in units of the rabi frequency ) and frequency @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the system is illuminated in a plane transverse to the cavity axis ( not necessarily at @xmath5 ) .",
    "the cavity mode couples with the atoms via the effective coupling strength @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the light - matter coupling coefficient and @xmath8 is the detuning between the light and atomic resonance  @xcite .",
    "this can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the regular bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the nearest neighbour tunneling amplitude , @xmath13 the on - site interaction and @xmath14 the chemical potential .",

    "@xmath28 is the relevant contribution to the quantum potential seen by atoms on top of classical ol described by the bh model , where the on - site interaction @xmath13 and hopping amplitude @xmath12 are short - range local processes .",
    "the effective parameters of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with the cavity field can be calculated from the wannier functions and are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the cavity and pump mode functions and @xmath31 are the wannier functions .",
    "the classical optical lattice potential is given by @xmath32 .",
    "the classical optical lattice defining the regular bose - hubbard hamiltonian is weakly dependent of the cavity parameters .",
    "the atoms are mainly trapped by the strong classical lattice , which is created inside a cavity by external laser beams .",
    "this external potential is insensitive to the quantum state of atoms .",
    "the light scattered into the cavity constitutes a quantum perturbation of the strong classical potential .",
    "this perturbation strongly depends on the many - body atomic state",
    ". additional nonlinear dependence on the bose hubbard parameters leading to semi - classical effects can be incorporated as in  @xcite .",
    "further , the classical optical lattice and cavity light can be detuned from each other .",
    "the light is pumped from the side of the main axis of the high q cavity , at an angle not necessarily at @xmath5 .",
    "the system is depicted in fig.[fqp ] , where the effect on the scattered light is shown and will be explained through the paper .    moreover , it is useful to exploit the spatial structure of light as a natural basis to define atomic modes , as the coupling coefficients @xmath33 can periodically repeat in space  @xcite .",
    "all atoms equally coupled to light belong to the same mode , while the ones coupled differently belong to different modes @xmath34 .",
    "then we have for the atomic operators , @xmath35 where the light induced  density \" @xmath36 and  bond \" @xmath37 mode operators , such that : @xmath38 with @xmath39 corresponding to the posible values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath33 where the pair @xmath21 are nearest neighbours .",
    "for example , when illuminating in the diffraction minima @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 are some constants .",
    "these encompass the different sets of values taken by the wannier overlap integrals @xmath33  @xcite . in addition",
    ", it is useful to define new emergent mode structures @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 , with @xmath21 nearest neighbours . in this case in diffraction minima ,",
    "note that these emergent bond terms are absent for structureless light , that is , scattering as it happens in the diffraction maxima of light ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "in order to describe the physics of the system , one can construct an effective matter hamiltonian from @xmath49 .",
    "however , difficulty arises because the operators @xmath50 and the bh hamiltonian do not commute in general . eliminating the light in the adiabatic limit , one can construct the effective hamiltonian by different methods  @xcite .",
    "however , the description is only accurate as long as the magnitude of the detuning @xmath51 is very large compared with any other energy scale . beyond the adiabatic limit ,",
    "our method relies on a series of canonical transformations constructed to eliminate the non - diagonal terms from the light - matter hamiltonian . in our method ,",
    "the cavity decay rate @xmath1 has been introduced phenomenologically to reproduce the limit of adiabatic elimination of the light field .",
    "we find the additional corrections due to the non - commutativity the light - matter interaction with the local processes of the matter part of the hamiltonian .",
    "essentially , we perform a sequence of rotations on the hilbert space using the formula , @xmath52_n}{n ! } \\label{formula}\\ ] ] with @xmath53_n$ ] the @xmath54-th order commutator with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "a sequence of rotation operators @xmath55 is performed , where these are chosen to remove the non - diagonal part of the light field in the light - matter interaction via the commutator expansion after their action .",
    "the particular structures needed and the number of rotations depend on the underlying structure of the matter part hamiltonian in the light - matter interaction and the bh model .",
    "their interplay with the by - products of each rotation determines the consecutive rotation operator to be constructed .",
    "thus , one provides an ansatz for each @xmath55 operator and eliminates according to the by - product of the next transformation  @xcite .",
    "the result of our method is a theory that incorporates in a perturbative operator expansion the interplay of the non - commutative character between local processes ( tunnelling and on - site interactions ) and the long - range ( nonlocal ) light induced effective interactions .",
    "the first transformation recovers the limit when light can be adiabatically eliminated , explicitly this is : @xmath56 therefore , @xmath57 is analogous to the displacement operator from quantum optics  @xcite , @xmath58 is the cavity purcell factor . thus using ( [ formula ] ) , @xmath59 \\label{adialim } \\\\ & + & \\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f\\big]c\\hat a^\\dagger-\\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f^\\dagger\\big]c^*\\hat a \\label{dyneff } \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f\\big]c\\hat a^\\dagger-\\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f^\\dagger\\big]c^*\\hat a,\\hat f\\big]c\\hat a^\\dagger \\label{sq1 } \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f\\big]c\\hat a^\\dagger-\\big[{\\mathcal{h}}^b,\\hat f^\\dagger\\big]c^*\\hat a,\\hat f^\\dagger\\big]c^*\\hat a+\\dots \\label{sq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to remove the additional non - diagonal light terms beyond the adiabatic limit ( [ adialim ] ) we need to perform additional rotations as we state below .",
    "dynamical effects occur due to ( [ dyneff ] ) and light squeezing originates from ( [ sq1 ] ) and ( [ sq2 ] ) , while the dots refer to higher order photon processes due to the commutator expansion that will not be considered in what follows .",
    "a subsequent series of rotations is employed to eliminate term by term the emergence of non diagonal terms in the light sector due to the interplay with short range processes .",
    "the sequence of rotations is , @xmath60 where each rotation is given by , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where , @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 additionally , we cast our results using the natural choice of dimensionless expansion parameters , which are defined as : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while @xmath67 where we have used collective weighted  bond \" operators @xmath68 and weighted ",
    "bond current \" operators @xmath69 corresponding to the light induced modes @xmath34 .",
    "these are defined as , @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "thus these collective operators are spatially modulated by the difference in density between nearest neighbour pairs @xmath72 .",
    "the above operators can be traced back to the modulations to the densities and currents that arise due to the fact that short range tunneling and/or on - site interactions do not commute with light - matter interaction components .",
    "the particular binomial structure of @xmath73 and @xmath74 arises as each rotation operator needed to diagonalize the hamiltonian generates higher order operator polynomials terms recursively due to the commutator expansion .",
    "these operators correspond to the emergence of particle - hole excitations and matter self - interactions in analogy to the feynman diagram expansion in momentum space . considering @xmath75 and @xmath76 as expansion parameters it is enough to consider the first few terms in the expansion of order ( @xmath77 ) linear in @xmath75 , @xmath76 and their product .",
    "thus @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the leading terms , however the full expansion can be used depending on the coupling strengths and partial re - summation of families of terms can be employed as in the standard techniques of many - body physics @xcite .",
    "the final transformation to obtain the effective matter hamiltonian of the system is achieved by , @xmath80=s(\\hat \\xi)\\ ] ] which is the analogous squeezing operator from quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the squeezing amplitude operator is given by , @xmath81 where it is useful to define  density fluctuations \" operators @xmath82 and  bond current fluctuations \" @xmath83 , @xmath84 these operators of quantum fluctuations of matter arise due to higher order light processes entangling the matter and the light .",
    "the transformation is used to eliminated non - diagonal terms due to higher order photon processes .",
    "we have restricted the expansion to two photon processes .",
    "therefore this contains the first nontrivial correction .",
    "the effect of additional higher order photon processes could be included in principle performing additional rotations , but we will not pursue this in what follows .",
    "after straight forward algebraic procedure applying each transformation and computing the relevant commutators using ( [ formula ] ) , we get the effective atomic matter hamiltonian : @xmath85 where , @xmath86 , which is the light part after the rotation to the pump frame of reference  @xcite .",
    "the effective atomic hamiltonian after the rotations is @xmath87 with , @xmath88 the result in the adiabatic limit of light  @xcite with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "here we have neglected the non - abelian shift in ( [ adialim ] ) , but in general it can be non - zero depending on the light mode functions for complex values i.e. travelling wave configurations where via either pump or cavity modes light in - between sites can be focused . as it has been shown  @xcite , this leads to the formation of structures of density and bond modes that can be nearly independent from each other .",
    "it is possible to generate in a single mode cavity spatial multimode structures of @xmath93 density modes  @xcite and @xmath94 bond modes  @xcite by carefully choosing how the light is pumped into the system  @xcite . in the adiabatic limit",
    "( [ ad ] ) , the structure of matter is controlled by the interplay between the bh processes , regular atomic tunneling and on - site interaction , and the light induced interaction proportional to @xmath95 .",

    ". these will modify the landscape of quantum phases the system can access , as well as , the properties of light beyond being a superposition of structured coherent states  @xcite . using the light induced mode decomposition ,",

    "the additional contributions in @xmath102 are the first order corrections in @xmath103 and @xmath76 originated by the non - commutative nature between local processes and the global structure introduced due to the light induced modes .",
    "the terms due to light induced dynamics are @xmath104 these dynamical terms can have a significant effect on the effective hamiltonian renormalizing the effective light induced interaction terms . additionally , they can aid the formation of structured ground - states due to their dependency on the atom number difference between nearest neighbour sites . in general , these terms tend to induce structure in the atomic density as @xmath105 increases due to light - matter quantum correlations @xmath106 and due to semiclassical effects for @xmath107  @xcite . in principle , going beyond the perturbation character of the expansion could be handled via renomalization .",
    "close to a structural phase transition , where @xmath108 , for example , from a structured ground - state ( with dw order ) to a homogenous ground - state ( a normal superfluid ) , the leading behaviour shows an instability for @xmath109 as , @xmath110 the formation of this instability means a structure ground state can be an energetically favourable solution depending on the coupling constants strengths and the competition with other processes , from the adiabatic limit and the bh model .",
    "this provides an amazing potential for manipulation with the purpose of quantum simulation , as one can select the inhibition or enhancement of the interplay with local processes .",
    "one can design this using the structure constants @xmath33 and @xmath95 , thus controlling the light induced mode formation and changing the onsite interactions via feshbach resonances or even via the classical optical lattice potential .",
    "the expansion could be further manipulated by the use of diagrammatic tools , including well know partial resumations techniques ( i.e. feynman diagrams ) but we will not pursue this here , as we are interested in the regime where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are perturbation parameters .",
    "the terms due to the interplay with short - range processes @xmath99 and @xmath98 contain the effect of higher order correlated processes , as they contain in addition to 2-point correlations , @xmath54-point correlations with @xmath111 .    beyond the adiabatic limit and dynamically generated processes , the additional terms in @xmath102 modify the energy due to light squeezing are : @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114",
    "are strongly smeared out in the limit where the effect of the light is classical .",
    "this occurs because the atoms maximise light scattering to reach the ground - state of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , these are relevant for the case where the strong classical signal is suppressed and the effect of light - matter quantum correlations is significant  @xcite . in general , they have a suppression effect upon fluctuations for @xmath115 while they promote an instability for @xmath116 , as @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , they introduce a direct modification to tunneling amplitudes that are controlled by the pattern of emergent bond modes via the different possible couplings @xmath45 .",
    "importantly , as we will show their origin has a non - trivial effect on the properties of light .",
    "as shown previously , the effective hamiltonian @xmath102 is diagonal in the light sector and first order quantum corrections have been included .",
    "it follows that the full solution to the light - matter state can be written as : @xmath118 where the subscript  @xmath119 \" (  @xmath120 \" ) corresponds to the light ( matter ) part ; @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the light components are squeezed coherent states @xmath123 , with the squeezing operator @xmath124 $ ] and the displacement operator @xmath125  @xcite .",

    "in addition , the squeezing parameter amplitudes corresponding to the projection onto the matter sector are @xmath132 with , the squeezing amplitude operator @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , the structure of the strongly correlated matter gets imprinted in the quantum properties of light via the squeezing parameter projections @xmath134 .",
    "this generates a non - trivial superposition of squeezed coherent states entangled with the strongly correlated matter . in the above , we have neglected next - nearest neighbour and higher processes , considered all the first order corrections @xmath135 and terms order @xmath136 while constraining to see the effect of two photon processes .",
    "however , this is not a limitation in our method , since additional @xmath54-neighbour processes or additional @xmath54-photon processes can be incorporated straightforward if relevant .",

    "this can be rewritten as , @xmath158 in particular when @xmath159 and @xmath160 so that @xmath161 is hermitian , then : @xmath162 for two light induced modes with density coupling ( @xmath163,@xmath164 ) in mean - field approximation , the above reduces to : @xmath165 where @xmath166 , and @xmath149 .",

    "we have used the identities , @xmath167 and that in mean - field approximation @xmath168 @xcite . beyond mean - field approximation , as the system goes in the normal sf state ( @xmath169 ) additional corrections due to additional coherent amplitudes that depend on their atomic fluctuations will increase the super - poissonian character of the light quadratures . the relation between quadrature components",
    "is shown in fig.[qpl]a .",
    "in particular , the quadratures at @xmath150 can be squeezed several db in the case where the cavity detunning is of the order of the recoil energy @xmath170 , as in  @xcite with @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "choosing @xmath173 and @xmath174 with @xmath175 in the sf state where fluctuations are maximal , one can easily achieve @xmath176 and about 10db of squeezing improving the ratio @xmath177 by changing the detunning or improving the cavity , see fig.[qpl]b .",
    "currently , squeezing with microwave fields has reached 10db  @xcite .",
    "minimising ( [ sqe ] ) , optimal squeezing is found when @xmath178 .",
    "optimal squeezing at @xmath150 is given by , @xmath179 therefore , optimal squeezing is limited strongly by how small is the ratio @xmath180 .",
    "note that each coherent state component is squeezed stronger by a factor of @xmath181 , squeezing in each component @xmath182 more with respect to the total state , see dashed lines in fig.[qpl](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "thus the projection to a single component improves optimal squeezing .",
    "this projection is even natural , being a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the system without optical lattice  @xcite . in the case of @xmath93 density modes",
    "one has in general for @xmath183 , @xmath184 with @xmath185 corresponding number operator of the light - induced density mode component per site . in general , projecting to a single component of @xmath93 modes produces an enhancement factor on squeezing of @xmath181 .",
    "for example , projecting to a single component with four light induced modes gives a enhancement factor of @xmath186 , see fig.[qpl](c ) dotted line .",
    "therefore , by incrementing the number of light - induced modes one can optimise squeezing in a single component even though the cavity decay ratio @xmath180 is not that small .",
    "the general structure of the light - matter properties for arbitrary number of bond and density modes is rather involved as it contains information regarding the correlated phases of matter that emerge .",
    "it is instructive to see the effect on the squeezing parameter @xmath147 for some cases , as we will show in what follows .",
    "when atoms scatter light homogeneously ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) , local density imbalance is suppressed .",
    "as it has been shown  @xcite , in the adiabatic limit sf and mi scatter light differently depending on the properties of the quantum many - body state . as other energy scales",
    "become relevant , the additional terms amount to renormalization of the induced interaction in the matter wave coherences , the terms in @xmath190 , such that @xmath191 for @xmath192 . this allows to enhance the effect due to the matter wave coherences via the on - site interaction in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the squeezing parameter using mean - field approximation is @xmath193 , with atom number per site @xmath194 and the sf order parameter @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , for a deep classical ol ( @xmath196 ) there will be no squeezing due to @xmath147 . as the classical ol becomes shallower ( @xmath197 ) ,",
    "the squeezing parameter is maximal for mi and smoothly decreases as we reach the sf state , see fig .",
    "[ transitions]a .",
    "this is correlated with the fact that light scattering while illuminating in between density maxima ( at the bonds ) is maximal in the mi while decreasing as the sf grows  @xcite .",
    "as the number of light induced modes in the matter increases , the induced structures play a substantial role on light squeezing . for 2 light induced modes , such that their amplitudes alternate sign every other site ( @xmath198 or @xmath199 and @xmath200 )",
    ", we find that the matter induces structure to the squeezing parameter .",
    "as it has been shown  @xcite besides from sf , mi the system supports gapped superfluid states , dimer phases , supersolid ( ss ) and density waves ( dw ) .      without bond ordering ( @xmath163 , @xmath198 )",
    ", the squeezing parameter is different for ss , dw , sf and mi phases . in mean field theory ,",
    "the squeezing parameter is proportional to the product of sf order parameters in each light induced component , @xmath201 where @xmath202 correspond to each light induced mode component .",
    "thus , for an insulating state ( dw or mi ) @xmath203 while for a sf @xmath204 and in the ss state @xmath205 .",
    "indeed , as the onsite interaction increases i.e. for half integer fillings when atoms scatter light maximally to reach the ground state of @xmath102 ( @xmath96 ) , light will be squeezed maximally in sf , while as ss emerges , it will diminish until reaching the dw state where no squeezing is possible , see fig .",
    "[ transitions]b .",
