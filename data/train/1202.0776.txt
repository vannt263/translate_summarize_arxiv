    "neutrino flavor transformation is a complex phenomenon : the general coherent neutrino state is a linear combination of several states with different energy and the oscillations between these states are affected by the presence of matter and may exhibit many - body effects , e.g.  @xcite , if the neutrino density is sufficiently high . yet despite this complexity , neutrino flavor transformation is a quantum phenomenon so that one should also expect an additional type of transformation : stimulated transitions driven by perturbing potentials with appropriate frequencies .",
    "this possibility of driving transitions between the neutrino states was recognized many years ago , e.g.@xcite , when periodic potentials were studied for their relevance for neutrinos passing through the earth and the sun .",
    "it was found , e.g.  @xcite , that large amplitude transitions - called parametric resonances - occur between the neutrino states when the frequency of the perturbation , @xmath0 , matches an integer fraction of the frequency associated with one of the energy splittings , i.e.  @xmath1 .",
    "this result is intriguing because any density profile can be decomposed into a fourier series , even non - periodic potentials e.g.  turbulence @xcite , and some terms in the series may have wavelengths which are capable of driving parametric resonance transitions .",
    "but even if such a mode is possessed by the profile , in order to observe the transition the neutrino must traverse a distance @xmath2 , where 1/@xmath3 is the reduced wavelength of the stimulated transition at the parametric resonance .",
    "this wavelength is a function of both the amplitude of the density perturbation , i.e.  the fourier coefficient , the perturbation wavelength 1/@xmath0 and the integer @xmath4 .",
    "but one needs relatively high densities and/or large amplitude fluctuations for an appreciable effect to occur over a reasonable distance and such conditions are not found in the earth or in the sun .",
    "the combination of large amplitude ( @xmath5 ) density fluctuations and high densities can be found in supernovae and supernova density fluctuations and were found numerically to have a large impact on neutrino flavor evolution @xcite . with this motivation , in this letter",
    "we revisit the phenomenon of stimulated transition for the supernova environment .",
    "we first derive expressions for the reduced wavelength and the amplitude of stimulated transitions both on and off the parametric resonance .",
    "next , to illustrate our findings , we examine the case of a specific supernova density profile which includes a forward shock to which we add a perturbing sinusoidal fluctuation . using this scenario , we predict the places where the transitions will occur and then verify our predictions with a numerical three neutrino oscillation calculation .",
    "our example demonstrates that it is possible to identify fluctuation wavelengths that will induce large amplitude transitions in the supernova environment .",
    "we are interested in the probability that some initial neutrino state @xmath6 at @xmath7 is later detected as the state @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "these probabilities are computed from the @xmath10-matrix which relates the initial and final states via @xmath11 .",
    "the probabilities we calculate depend upon the basis and to avoid the intrinsic oscillatory behavior in the flavor basis we prefer to use the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath12 , known as the matter basis .",
    "the two bases are related by the unitary transformation matrix @xmath13 . for three flavors / mass states",
    "the matrix @xmath13 is parametrized by three mixing angles , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , a cp phase and two majoranna phases .",

    "the problem we have in mind is the case where @xmath22 possesses some sort of ` smooth ' component we denote by @xmath23 and a perturbation @xmath24 . thus the flavor basis hamiltonian is split into three terms , @xmath25 , which we group as @xmath26 .",
    "the matter states are defined as those which diagonalize @xmath27 i.e.  if @xmath28 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of @xmath12 then @xmath13 is @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , the unperturbed matter states are defined as those which diagonalize @xmath30 i.e.  @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix of unperturbed eigenvalues , @xmath33 , of @xmath34 . in this basis",

    "the diagonal elements are easily removed by writing the matrix @xmath39 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 a diagonal matrix @xmath45 .",
