    "the feynman - kac formula @xcite provides a powerful connection between the imaginary time evolution of quantum systems in the continuum and probabilistic expectations over wiener classical trajectories .",
    "its extension to the case of multicomponent wavefunctions requires the introduction of a further expectation over stochastic poisson processes @xcite .",
    "the role of poisson processes is central in the probabilistic representation of berezin integrals over anticommuting variables and , in general , of the time evolution of discrete systems @xcite . in the simplified formulation",
    "@xcite it is shown that the real time or the imaginary time dynamics of systems described by a finite hamiltonian matrix , representing bosonic or fermionic degrees of freedom , is expressed in terms of the evolution of a proper collection of independent poisson processes . for a lattice system",
    "the poisson processes are associated to the links of the lattice and their jump rates can be arbitrary . in @xcite",
    "it is demonstrated that when the rates of the poisson processes are chosen equal to the hopping coefficients of the system the probabilistic representation leads to an optimal algorithm which coincides with the green function quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method @xcite in the limit when the latter becomes exact @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the probabilistic representation @xcite to derive analytical expressions for the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the long time limit .",
    "our approach is based on a series expansion of the probabilistic expectation in terms of conditional expectations with a fixed number @xmath0 of jumps of the poisson processes .",
    "this resembles the expansion of the grand canonical partition function in statistical mechanics in terms of canonical averages with a fixed number of particles . by integrating out the @xmath0 stochastic jump times ,",
    "we show that the conditional expectations become averages of functions which depend only on the multiplicities @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the values assumed by the potential and hopping energies , respectively , of the configurations visited by the system . according to a central limit theorem , at large values of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ long times , the rescaled multiplicities @xmath3 and @xmath4 become gaussian distributed and the corresponding averages can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian probability density do not depend on the hamiltonian parameters and are easily determined statistically . finally , the series of the conditional expectations can be re - summed with a saddle - point method . as a remarkable result",
    ", we find that the ground state energy is semi - analytically determined by solving a simple scalar equation .",
    "once this equation is solved the quantum expectation in the ground state for other operators can be determined analytically by using the hellman - feynman theorem .",
    "the result is valid for boson or fermion systems . as regards fermions the well known sign problem @xcite is avoided by introducing an approximation related to the exact counting of the positive and negative contributions in the noninteracting case",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ representation ]",
    "we review the probabilistic representation of quantum dynamics in the case of a generalized hubbard hamiltonian . in section [ decomposition ]",
    "we decompose the expectation in canonical averages of weights which are calculated analytically .",
    "the canonical averages are evaluated at long times via a central limit theorem in section [ centrallimit ] .",
    "the equation for the ground - state energy is discussed in section [ bosons ] for hard - core bosons and in section [ fermions ] for fermions . in section [ correlations ]",
    "we show how to calculate ground - state correlation functions within our approach .",
