    "the shape of an object provides important clues for understanding its nature , in particular , the past and ongoing physical processes responsible for shaping the object . a mathematical branch known as the integral geometry offers an unique opportunity providing a set of simple morphological measures that can be used to characterize an isolated single objects as well as a multi - component object .",
    "these measures were suggested by h. minkowski ( minkowski 1903 ) and known as the minkowski functionals ( mfs ) .",
    "the parameters devised from mfs are robust , yielding local as well as global morphological information of any spatial structure .",
    "we discuss this set of measures in galaxy morphology specifically we propose a technique to restore galaxy images distorted by the background noise .",
    "the mfs was introduced into cosmology by mecke , buchert , & wagner ( 1994 ) and later used in variety of cosmological problems ( see e.g. beisbart 2000 ; beisbart , buchert , & wagner 2001 ; novikov , feldman & shandarin , 1999 ; schmalzing & buchert 1997 ; schmalzing & gorski 1998 ; schmalzing et al .",

    "background noise distorts the original profile of a galaxy and therefore its isophotal contours will always be deviated from their true shapes . in galaxy morphology finding the true shape of a galaxy profile is extremely important to understand its evolution , dynamical state and environmental effects .",
    "the effects of noise can be reduced in several ways .",
    "one approach is to smoothing the map with some filter , the other could be incorporating systematic effects into estimates of the parameters by introducing corrections .",
    "we introduce a simple linear technique that smoothes not the whole map but only its contours chosen some specific levels above background .",
    "the method of smoothing is based on replacing the set of contour points by a new set each point of which is placed exactly in the middle of two adjacent points in the original set .",
    "this set of new points construct a new contour what we call a contour one time smoothed from the previous one .",
    "the minkowski parameters are then computed for this smoothed contour .",
    "the procedure is applied iteratively many times depending on the length of the contour and the level of the noise . to implement this method , finding a lower limit to begin smoothing and",
    "an upper limit up to which one should stop is very crucial as without any knowledge of the true shape one can in fact smooth a contour so much that for using this particular approach the resulting contour would ultimately appear as circular and eventually with further smoothing as a point . to get a control over this situation one can convolve simulated galaxy profiles with noises of known properies , find effective limits for smoothing and then calibrate it for real galaxy images .",
    "we follow this approach to select smoothing limits where we clip the galaxy image at a certain level above the background noise and find the total number of contour points , @xmath0 .",
    "next we set the first smoothing limit equal to the one - tenth ( @xmath1 ) of the number of contour points .",
    "detail analysis shows that this is a reasonable choice to start the smoothing .",
    "the subsequent higher number of smoothing is just the integer multiple of the first .",
    "note that the required smoothing and the accuracy with which one can determine the original shape depends crucially on the steepness of the profile .",
    "higher the gradient of the profile more accurate one would be to find the true shape and less amount smoothing will be required ."
