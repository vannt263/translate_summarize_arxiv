    "is a fixed - target experiment which studies collisions of protons with the nuclei of atoms in target wires positioned in the halo of hera s 920 gev proton beam . the large acceptance of the   spectrometer coupled with high - granularity particle - identification devices and a precision vertex detector allow for detailed studies of complex multi - particle final states . s",

    "analysis of modest data samples which had been taken in the commissioning run of year 2000 was completed by early 2003 and led to publications on the  cross section  @xcite , the ratio of  to  production cross sections  @xcite and on the production cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .    during the hera run which began in summer 2002 and ended in march 2003 ,  accumulated 150 million events with its di - lepton trigger .",
    "the di - lepton sample includes 300,000 events with a  in the final state , roughly equally divided between di - muon and di - electron decays .",
    "this sample is more than 50 times larger than the sample accumulated in the 2000 run , but thanks to the large number of improvements in detector and trigger systems could be recorded in a similar amount of beam time .",
    "thanks to improvements in the data acquisition system , recording rates of a 1000 events per second ( more than 1 terabyte per day ) for minimum bias data were achieved which allowed collection of a 200  million events minimum bias sample in just one week of calendar time .",
    "this represents an increase in sample size by more than a factor of 100 with respect to the 2000 run .",
    "having successfully accumulated these interesting data samples , the  collaboration decided in early 2003 to definitively finish data - taking activities at the end of running period and to concentrate on analyzing the accumulated data .",
    "several studies are in progress on both the di - lepton and the minimum bias samples .",

    "a precise measurement of the b cross section in hadronic interactions at fixed target energies would be welcome in part as a test of calculations , in part to give guidance for setting the parameters of the theory @xcite .",
