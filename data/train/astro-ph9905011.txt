    "supersoft x - ray binaries , highly luminous ( @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ) and low - temperature ( 2040 ev ) x - ray sources , were established as a new class of objects by rosat ( trmper  1991 , greiner  1991 , van den heuvel  1992 ) .",
    "the archetype supersoft binary , cal 83 , exhibits a 25 pc ionization nebula ( pakull  1989 , remillard  1995 ) . aimed at identifying supersoft x - ray sources in the andromeda galaxy via an ionization nebula we have searched for extended optical emission within the x - ray error boxes of the 15 supersoft sources within m31 ( greiner  1996 ) .",
    "one optical nebula was found ( fig .",
    "[ fc ] ) , and we obtained detailed optical data  spectroscopy as well as narrow - band imaging  to determine its relation to the positionally correlated supersoft x - ray source rx j0045.5 + 4206 .    anticipating the identification of the central star as a wolf - rayet star , we will briefly introduce this stellar type and its relation to nebulae before proceeding with the observations .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars were first identified by their broad emission lines ( wolf & rayet 1867 ) .",
    "these broad emission lines are thought to be indicative of a thick expanding stellar atmosphere .",
    "the line widths imply terminal velocities of 10003000 km / s , suggesting that the outflowing stellar material is gravitationally unbound .",
    "wr stars have typical mass loss rates of a few times 10@xmath2 /yr and are the most powerful sources of stellar winds among massive early - type stars ( barlow 1982 , abbott & conti 1987 , maeder & conti 1994 ) .    a considerable fraction of wr stars , though not all , are surrounded by ring nebula ( e.g. miller & chu 1993 , marston 1997 ) which are thought to be leftovers of the evolutionary phase when the massive wr - progenitors stripped off their outer envelopes .",
    "theoretically one would expect two shells around a wr star according to the evolutionary stages , i.e. a large fossil bubble of ism swept up during the main - sequence stage , and a small bubble of circumstellar material blown away from the wr wind .",
    "follow - up studies of the wr nebulae have shown , however , that not all ring nebulae are wind - blown bubbles consisting of ism ( weaver 1977 ) . in some cases",
    "the nebulae contain mostly stellar matter with which the wr wind is interacting , while in other cases the nebulae are ionized by the uv flux of the central wr star .    the population of wolf - rayet stars in the milky way and the local group has been the subject of ample studies ( e.g. massey 1998 , massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "it is important not only for the study of each particular star , but also because of their role in stellar evolution as well as their contribution to and interaction with the interstellar matter .",
    "it provides also evolutionary information about the galaxies they belong to .",
    "there have been systematic searches of wr stars in our galaxy , the magellanic clouds , m31 and m33 as well as several other nearby galaxies ( e.g. massey 1999 , massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "m 31 has been surveyed several times with different goals . in an early attempt to establish the existence of gaseous nebulae , baade & arp ( 1964 ) compiled a list of 688 emission nebula .",
    "one of these nebulae , called ba 1 - 642 , is the nebula which we found during our cross - correlation with supersoft x - ray sources .",
    "the same object is also listed as pav78 915 in the catalog of pellet  ( 1978 ) .",
    "a systematic search for wr stars in m31 was conducted largely by moffat &  shara ( 1983 , 1987 ) .",
    "the central object of this nebula has been classified as a wr star candidate ( object mla 1159 ; meyssonier  1993 ) based on an objective - prism survey of m 31 with a dispersion of 2000  / mm in the 43505300   range .    here",
    "we report the confirmation of this wr star classification and present results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of the wr star as well as the ring - like nebulae surrounding it .",
    "imaging observations of the region of the x - ray error box of rx j0045.4 + 4206 ( see fig .",
    "[ fc ] ) were performed during three nights in october 1921 , 1996 with the 1.5 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional ( oan ) de san pedro mrtir ( spm ) , mxico , equipped with a 1024@xmath31024 pixel ccd tek .",
    "the total field of view was 43@xmath343 .",
    "the seeing was typically 15 , thus we observed with the ccd chip binned to 2@xmath32 and with a corresponding pixel scale of 051/pixel .",
    "images were obtained in various filter bands ( see table [ filt ] , listing central wavelength , fwhm and peak transmission ) to allow a diagnostic of the excitation level .",

    "the boller & chivens spectrograph with a 600 l / mm ( 1996 ) and 400 l / mm ( 1997 ) grating was employed to get spectra with overall fwhm resolution of 4.5 and 67  .",
    "the seeing was typically 15 , and consequently a 2  slit has been used .",
    "the data reduction again used standard midas procedures of the long - slit spectrum reduction package .",
    "finally , we also observed the nebula with the unam fabry - perot interferometer puma .",
    "the fabry - perot observations of the nebula ba 1 - 642 were carried out during the night of november 2 , 1997 at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the 2.1  m telescope of the oan spm using the unam scanning fabry  perot interferometer puma ( rosado  1995 ) .    a 1024@xmath31024 thinned tektronix ccd detector , with an image scale of 0.59 arcsec  pixel@xmath1 ,",
    "was used with a 2@xmath32 on - chip binning in both dimensions .",

    "an interference filter centered at @xmath6   and having a bandpass of 20   was used in order to isolate the h@xmath5 line .",
    "the scanning fabry - perot interferometer is an et-50 of queensgate instruments with a servo - stabilization system .",
    "the main characteristics of this interferometer are : interference order of 330 , free spectral range of 18.92   ( equivalent to a velocity range of 908 km  s@xmath1 ) and sampling spectral resolution of 0.41 (equivalent to 18.9 km  s@xmath1 ) at the wavelength of the h@xmath5 line , achieved by scanning the interferometer gap at 48 positions .",
    "thus , the resulting data cubes have dimensions of 512@xmath3512@xmath348 .    under these conditions ,",
    "we have obtained one nebular data cube with an exposure time of 48 min .",
    "we also obtained two calibration data cubes spaced at the beginning and at the end of the observations in order to check for possible flexures of the equipment .",
    "for the calibration cubes we have used the ne line at @xmath7 6598.95  .",
    "[ wrspec ]    the data reduction and analysis were performed using the specific reduction package cigale ( le coarer  1993 ) .",
    "this software was used to remove the cosmic rays , to carry out the wavelength calibration of the data cubes , to obtain continuum subtracted @xmath7-cubes and to carry out the emission line profile analysis .",
    "the spectrum of the central star , mla 1159 ( fig .",
    "[ wrspec ] ) , shows strong and broad emission lines at 4650   and 5805   ( which we interpret as and ) , and clearly suggest a carbon wolf - rayet star thus confirming the wolf - rayet candidacy proposed by meyssonier  ( 1993 ) .",

    ", we derive @xmath14 = 5.7@xmath150.3 mag , at the bright end of the range of absolute magnitudes of wc5 - 6 stars of @xmath14 = 3.9@xmath150.5 mag ( lundstrm & stenholm 1984 ) .",

    "[ fpall ] shows the puma @xmath7-maps corresponding to the velocity channels where the nebula ba 1 - 642 is detected .",
    "we see that it covers a velocity range from v@xmath17 = 157 km  s@xmath1 to 24 km  s@xmath1 having maximum intensity at v@xmath18 100 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that other m31 nebulae are also detected in the 10 arcmin field of the puma at the same velocities but with a narrower range in velocity .",
    "this suggests that ba 1 - 642 has internal motions larger than the internal motions of classical hii regions .",
    "[ fpha ] is an enlargement of one of the velocity channels ( at v@xmath17 = 100 km",
    "s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the wr star mla 1159 is located within a nearly circular nebula ( see also figs .",
    "[ fc ] , [ nebima ] ) .",
    "the south - east rim of the nebula is very pronounced , particularly in the h@xmath5 line .",
    "however , from this figure we also note , that there is some extended structure on the west and the total complex probably consists of two different sets of nebulosities : a nearly hemispherical internal bubble with an angular size of 34@xmath326 arcsec corresponding to a linear size of 107@xmath382 pc at the adopted distance of 650 kpc to m31 ( this is ba 1 - 642 @xmath16 pav78 915 ) and a v - shaped nebulosity to the west of the internal bubble ( note that this part has its own nomenclature , i.e. ba 1 - 641 @xmath16 pav78 913 ) .",
    "a close inspection of fig . [ fpha ] suggests that this second nebulosity seems to be a thick shell of 74 arcsec in diameter ( equivalent to 233 pc ) centered at the northern edge of the internal bubble .",
    "the external shell is brighter near the mla 1159 which is probably photoionizing this nebulosity .",
    "the fact that both nebulosities have their maximum intensities in the same velocity channel implies that they would be at the same galactocentric distance and consequently a physical link between them is favored against a chance superposition along the line of sight . the thick shell could be a trace of the photoionization or the interaction with the interstellar medium of the winds of the progenitor of the wr star or other massive stars .",
    "deeper observations are required in order to confirm this hypothesis . in the following",
    "we will restrict our kinematical study to the internal bubble .",
    "we have obtained radial velocity profiles integrated in several zones of the bubble , the brightest region of the shell and other hii regions of the field .",
    "we confirm that the shell has the same velocity as the borders of the bubble : v@xmath18 100 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "even if our velocity profiles have low s / n ratio ( about 4 ) we are able to detect two heliocentric velocity components for the central region of the bubble : at 83 and 131 km  s@xmath1 with an uncertainty of about 4 km  s@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity profiles at the edges of the bubble are simple and can be fitted by a single gaussian function .",
    "this could be interpreted as an expansion motion with a velocity of 25 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "consequently , we can estimate the kinematic age of the nebula using t@xmath19 = 0.6 r / v where t@xmath19 is in units of 10@xmath20 yr , r in pc and v in km  s@xmath1 ( taken from weaver  1977 models for the evolution of wind blown bubbles , see also rosado 1986 ) .",
    "taking r = 54 pc and v = 25 km  s@xmath1 , we obtain a kinematic age of 2.1 10@xmath21 yr .",
    "this value of the kinematic age is larger than the duration of the wr phase .",
    "thus , this bubble could not be formed by the wind of mla 1159 ( i.e. w - type , chu 1981 , rosado 1986 ) . instead",
    ", this bubble should be formed by the wr star progenitor and is only illuminated by the wr star ( i.e. r@xmath22-type , chu 1981 , rosado 1986 ) .",
    "this is typical for the nebulae associated with wc - type stars .",
    "the shape and the size of the nebula is very similar at different wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "[ nebima ] with images of the nebula in the six bands , h@xmath4 , , h@xmath5 , and ) .",
    "the nebula shows strong balmer emission lines , and but weak ( see fig .",
    "we note that the emission lines are all blue - shifted by 34  , consistent with the above reported velocities .",
    "it is not completely clear whether the ring - like nebula is physically center filled or not , because it shows less emission in the inner parts .",
    "nevertheless , we have measured the size for both the inner and the outer ring based on the pronounced , bright south - east rim visible in the h@xmath5 image to @xmath23and @xmath24 , respectively . at the distance of m31 this corresponds to radii of 34 and 50 pc , respectively .",
    "using the ratio of 5007  / h@xmath25 as criterion , the excitation class is estimated to be 0.5 according to the system of feast ( 1968 ) and webster ( 1975 ) .",
    "this and the lack of nebular emission lines indicate that ba 1 - 642 is a low - excitation nebula .    the integrated h@xmath4 line flux in regions ib and iib is 3@xmath310@xmath26 and 2@xmath310@xmath26 .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath4 filter image shows that region ib corresponds to the mean h@xmath4 flux integrated over the full nebula .",
    "we therefore scaled the integrated h@xmath4 line flux from region ib by the fractional area of the extraction region to derive a total h@xmath4 line luminosity of the nebula of 4@xmath310@xmath27 erg / s .",
    "this h@xmath4 line luminosity is a few percent of the luminosity of the wolf - rayet star , and thus can be produced by the irradiation of the central wolf - rayet star .",

    "we note that this is not very strict , but again consistent with what is known for hii regions .",
    "second , we have performed photoionization calculations with the code _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "we assumed the gas clouds to be dust - free ( except if stated otherwise ) and illuminated by the continuum of the central wolf - rayet star .",
    "the continuum shape was approximated by a blackbody , its temperature left free to vary ( since there is no one - to - one match in temperature of a blackbody and a wolf - rayet atmosphere ) .",
    "solar gas abundances ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) were adopted if not stated otherwise .",
    "the gas was assumed to be ionization bounded .",
    "the aim of these photoionization calculations is to reproduce the observed line - ratios , get clues on the ionizing continuum shape ( within the limits of the blackbody assumption ) , decide whether we see a filled volume or shell , derive various properties of the nebula ( like ionization parameter , temperature , thickness ) , constrain abundances , and check for the presence of dust .",
    "we have calculated a large grid of photoionization models varying the ionizing continuum ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) and the radius ( equivalent to the ionization parameter ) .",
    "test calculations were also performed for different density , metallicity and the presence of dust .",
    "the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number rate of photons above 13.6 ev , @xmath40 is the distance between the wolf - rayet star and the emission - line gas , @xmath41 is the hydrogen density and @xmath42 is the speed of light .",

    "the nebula itself seems to form a shell and based on the kinematic age and mass is thought to be interstellar matter swept up by the wind of the wr star mla 1159 .",
    "an important question to be addressed is on the mechanism which produces the nebular emission .",
    "the lack of filamentary structures together with a diffuse emission in seemingly shell geometry and the identical extent of the nebula at different emission lines suggests that the nebula is not shock excited , but rather photoionized .",
    "also , the emission line width and the low density which is similar to that in typical hii regions suggest photoionization as the main origin .",
    "finally , the satisfactory fits obtained with the code _ cloudy _ to explain the relative line strengths implies that photoionization is a reasonable assumption .",
    "our successful model is characterized by an ionization parameter @xmath54 and it is interesting to note that previous investigations of wolf - rayet nebulae ( and giant hii regions ) found values for the ionization parameter close to @xmath64 as well , with a rather narrow range in @xmath65 ( e.g. , esteban  1993 , bresolin  1999 ) which led to the suggestion that the stellar winds cause a close scaling of ionizing flux and shell gas density ( shields 1986 ) .",
    "we finally note that photoionization modelling employing blackbody continua for the ionizing flux instead of real wr star atmospheres are expected to derive lower temperatures .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ( he- and ) c - rich stellar atmosphere absorbs most of the extreme uv ionizing photons ( @xmath66 228  ) , thus emitting many fewer uv photons than a blackbody of the same temperature ( koesterke & hamann 1997 ) . because of the original goal of identifying a supersoft x - ray source we mention here that the x - ray source 13  is very likely not related to either the wc6 star or the nebula .",
    "if 13  were within the nebula , it would be the dominant ionization source and produce very strong emission , i.e. /h@xmath4@xmath671020 which is not observed . with a bolometric ( blackbody approximation ) luminosity of 13  of the order of 10@xmath61",
    "the x - ray emission is also very unlikely produced by the wc6 star which typically have x - ray luminosities around a few times 10@xmath68 .",
