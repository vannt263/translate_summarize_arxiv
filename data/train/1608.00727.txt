    "following l. euler , we define the elastic energy of a regular planar convex body @xmath4 ( a planar convex compact set ) by the formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the curvature and @xmath7 is the arc length .",
    "we will denote by @xmath8 the class of regular ( @xmath9 ) bounded planar convex bodies .",
    "several recent works involving this elastic energy appeared during the two last years , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors were interested in finding sharp inequalities between @xmath2 , the area @xmath10 or the perimeter @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , we can consider several minimization problems for @xmath2 when putting different geometric constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath12 for the diameter , @xmath13 for the circumradius ( radius of the smallest disk containing @xmath3 ) and @xmath14 for the inradius ( radius of the largest disk contained in @xmath3 ) .",
    "let us remark that @xmath15 scales as @xmath16 under a dilation : @xmath17 , thus it will always be equivalent to consider the minimization problem with an equality constraint or with an inequality constraint .",
    "let us recall what is known ( or what is an easy consequence of what is known ) in that context .",
    "* minimization with a perimeter constraint * : + the solution of @xmath18 is the disk of perimeter @xmath19 . + indeed by using the cauchy - schwarz inequality we deduce @xmath20 with equality only in the case of a disk .",
    "this minimal property can also be written by homogeneity @xmath21 let us remark that this minimal property can be extended in a straightforward way to any regular set @xmath3 : by filling the holes we decrease both perimeter and elastic energy , so it is enough to consider only simply connected sets for which the previous proof works as well .",
    "* minimization with an area constraint * : + the solution of @xmath22 is the disk of area @xmath23 . + for convex domains , this result has been proved by m.e .",
    "gage in @xcite .",
    "it has been recently extended to simply connected domains by d. bucur and the first author in @xcite and by v. ferone , b. kawohl and c. nitsch in @xcite .",
    "it is trivially wrong if we remove the assumption of simple - connectedness : consider a ring @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "this minimal property can also be written by homogeneity @xmath26    * minimization with a diameter constraint * : + the solution of @xmath27 is the disk of diameter @xmath28 .",
    "+ indeed , it is well known that for any plane convex domain @xmath3 , the inequality @xmath29 holds true ( with equality for any set of constant width ) , see @xcite .",
    "thus , combining with ( [ int1 ] ) yields @xmath30 with equality only for the disk .",
    "this result still holds for any regular planar set , since taking the convex hull does not change the diameter while it decreases the elastic energy .",
    "* minimization with a circumradius constraint * : + the solution of @xmath31 is the disk of radius @xmath32 .",
    "+ indeed , it is well known that for any plane convex domain @xmath3 , the inequality @xmath33 holds true ( with equality for any set of constant width ) , see @xcite .",
    "thus , combining with ( [ int1 ] ) yields @xmath34 with equality only for the disk .",
    "this result still holds for any regular planar set , since taking the convex hull does not change the circumradius while it decreases the elastic energy .    the last problem we want to consider is the minimization problem with an inradius constraint . without loss of generality and because the homogeneity property , we can fix the inradius to be one .",
    "we will denote by @xmath35 the unit disk .",
    "thus we want to study : @xmath36 since we work with bounded convex domains , the strip @xmath37 ( which would have zero elastic energy ) is not admissible .",
    "it turns out that this problem is more difficult and surprisingly , we will discover that the optimal domain * is not * the disk .",
    "more precisely , the main result of this paper is    [ mainth ] for any convex domain @xmath38 with inradius @xmath14 , the following inequality holds @xmath39 equality in ( [ theo1 ] ) is obtained for the convex domain @xmath40 symmetric with respect to @xmath41 and defined on @xmath42 by , see figure [ optimal_curve ] :    [ optimal_curve ]    @xmath43\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 moreover , the elastic energy of the optimal domain is @xmath45 .",
    "the optimal domain @xmath46 described in theorem [ mainth ] is clearly not unique .",
    "indeed any `` stadium - like '' domain obtained by inserting two equal horizontal segments at north and south poles of @xmath46 will provide another @xmath9 optimal domain .",
    "let us remark that it can be seen directly that @xmath46 has a lower elastic energy than the unit disk @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , using cauchy - schwarz inequality for @xmath23 yields @xmath47    the proof of theorem [ mainth ] will follow the classical method of calculus of variations : existence , regularity and use of the optimality conditions to derive the optimal set which is described above .",
    "more precisely , fixing two consecutive contact points @xmath48 and @xmath49 of a domain with its inscribed ( unit ) disk , we are led to study the sub - problem of minimizing the elastic energy of a ( convex ) arc @xmath50 joining @xmath51 and @xmath52 with tangents @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    ", the minimization problem ( [ pbpalpha ] ) can be written in terms of the unknown @xmath74 as @xmath81 in this section , we are going to prove existence of a minimizer for problem @xmath60 .",

    "let @xmath87 parametrized by @xmath88 be a minimizing sequence and let us denote by @xmath89 its length .",
    "by convexity the arc @xmath87 is contained in the sector delimited by the two tangents at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , therefore its length is uniformly bounded : @xmath90 . in order to work on a fixed sobolev space @xmath75 ,",

    ", we can assume that @xmath91 converges uniformly on @xmath96 $ ] to some function @xmath74 and weakly in @xmath75 .",
    "now the lower semi - continuity of @xmath97 shows that @xmath74 provides the desired minimizer .",

    "the integral constraints of the optimization problem remain satisfied at the limit also by uniform convergence , which concludes proof of theorem [ theoexistence1 ] .",
    "now we assume that the arcs @xmath50 touch the unit disk only at south and north pole @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "since the arc has to be included now in the strip @xmath105 ( and not in a sector ) the main difficulty is that its length is not _ a priori _ bounded .",
    "therefore our strategy is the following :    * we solve the minimization problem with a fixed , given , length @xmath59 , * we compute the energy of this optimal arc , say @xmath106 , * we prove that this energy blows up when @xmath107 or at least converges to something that we control .",

    "* first step : * we fix a length @xmath112 and we solve the minimization problem with this length . actually , it is exactly the problem of elasticae as introduced by l. euler since the two extremities points and the two tangents are given .",
    "existence of an optimal arc follows exactly as in the proof of theorem [ theoexistence1 ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath113 such an optimal arc and @xmath114 its parametrization .",
    "let us remark that we do not need to assume convexity here .",
    "* second step : * let us write the optimality conditions for the optimal arc .",

    "actually , this equation is a classical pendulum equation and its solution can be written explicitly in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "we will not use it here .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 must satisfy the constraints @xmath124 using these relations together with @xmath125 in ( [ op0 ] ) yields @xmath126 .",

    "this finishes the proof .",
    "in this section , we want first to write the general optimality conditions satisfied by the minimizer @xmath74 .",
    "we deduce @xmath164 regularity of the minimizer .",

    "we follow a similar approach as section [ section2.2 ] . integrating this relation between @xmath139 and @xmath59 yields @xmath231 in the same way , multiplying by @xmath137 and integrating between @xmath139 and @xmath59 yields @xmath232 adding and , we get @xmath233 now ,",
