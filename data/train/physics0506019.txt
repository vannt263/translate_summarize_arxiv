    "<S> this was justified by the presence of strong magnetic fields in astrophysics ( neutron stars and white dwarfsg ) , magnetic neutron stars ( @xmath3 g ) , magnetars ( @xmath4 g ) ] ) , as well as in plasma and semiconductor physics . in particular , for many years it has existed a question about the content of the neutron star atmosphere . since the seminal papers by kadomtsev - kudriavtsev @xcite and ruderman @xcite it was believed that the neutron star atmosphere subject to a strong magnetic field is made from atomic - molecular compounds . however , in order to construct a model of the atmosphere it is necessary to explore matter and its properties in a strong magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was discovered that the interplay of coulomb and magnetic forces for @xmath5 g leads to a new physics : new bound one - electron coulomb systems appear like the exotic molecular ions @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these coulomb systems do not exist without magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> all of them are characterized by very large binding energies growing with magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> for all magnetic fields , where the non - relativistic considerations are justified ( @xmath9 g ) , of one - electron atomic - molecular systems the hydrogen atom - the only neutral system- is characterized by the highest ( ! ) total energy , being correspondingly the least bound system @xcite . at the same time it seems natural to assume that more - than - one - electron coulomb systems in a strong magnetic field are not strongly bound ( if bound ) due to the fact that all electron spins should be parallel , being antiparallel to the magnetic field direction .    </S>",
    "<S> all one - electron molecular systems have a certain common feature . </S>",
    "<S> their optimal configuration is always a configuration where all massive charged centers are situated on a magnetic line . </S>",
    "<S> we call it _ parallel configuration_. </S>",
    "<S> only these configurations are considered in the present article .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that studies in a strong magnetic field are very complicated for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps , the most serious , conceptual reason is related to the fact that the bound states are of a weakly - bound - state nature ( the binding energies are much smaller than the total ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation theory in powers of @xmath10 is fast divergent and thus can not be used . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic expansions at @xmath11 have extremely complicated form but , usually , have no domain of applicability inside non - relativistic considerations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it can be easily checked that at an extremely strong magnetic field near the edge of applicability of non - relativistic approximation @xmath12 , ] the ionization energy @xmath13 calculated numerically differs by 300% ( ! ) from the value obtained using the leading term in asymptotic expansion @xmath14 where @xmath13 is given in atomic units as well as @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> another example is given by the ratio of the binding energies of @xmath15 and @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> usually , these methods are very slow - convergent and extremely difficult to implement . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular method to study one - electron molecular systems is the variational method ( for review , see @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> it seems natural to create some approximate expressions valid for all magnetic fields , even having not high accuracy , in order to make at least rough estimates .    </S>",
    "<S> the accurate results of calculations of different quantities for low - lying states reveal a smooth , simple - looking behavior with rather slow changes with magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> . however , a straightforward attempt to construct approximations either fails or leads to quite complicated expressions , at least , at first sight ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> physical intuition gives a feeling that there must exist a certain qualitative technique , for example a type of semi - classical approximation providing an approximate qualitative description of these results . </S>",
