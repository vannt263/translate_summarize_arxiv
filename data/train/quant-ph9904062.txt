    "the quantized motional states of atoms or ions in confining potentials offer interesting possibilities for a variety of applications , such as the preparation and study of nonclassical ( i.e. , manifestly quantum ) states @xcite , and the storage and manipulation of quantum information ( e.g. , `` qubits '' ) , with particular reference to quantum logic operations and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "these possibilities stem from the relatively long coherence times that can be achieved with motional states ( due to the absence of strong damping mechanisms ) and the precision with which transformations between motional states can be controlled using laser - light - induced transitions .    however , while motional states are well - suited to the storage and manipulation of quantum states , for the communication of quantum information from one physical location to another it is clear that photons are the preferred carriers of the information .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to provide and examine configurations in which motional states can be efficiently and reliably transferred to states of light , and vice - versa .",
    "here enters the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) ; in particular , configurations in which a single mode of the electromagnetic field supported by an optical cavity is strongly coupled to a transition in a single atom .",
    "it is possible , via the internal atomic transition , to also couple the cavity field to the external ( quantized ) motion of the trapped atom or ion @xcite , and in this work we will examine such a coupling that enables the above - mentioned state transfer .",
    "our model consists of a single two - level atom ( or ion ) confined in a harmonic trap located inside an optical cavity .",
    "the atomic transition of frequency @xmath0 is coupled to a single mode of the cavity field of frequency @xmath1 and is also assumed to be driven by an external ( classical ) laser field of frequency @xmath2  the cavity and laser field frequencies will be chosen so as to drive raman transitions that couple neighbouring vibrational levels of the external motion . the physical setup and excitation scheme are depicted in fig .  1 . the cavity is aligned along the @xmath3-axis , while the laser field is incident from a direction in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane ( i.e. , perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the internal and external atomic degrees of freedom plus the atom - cavity and atom - laser couplings takes the form ( in a frame rotating at the laser frequency ) @xmath6 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ , \\hbar g_0 \\sin ( k\\hat{x } ) ( \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\sigma}_- + \\hat{\\sigma}_+\\hat{a } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 are the harmonic oscillation frequencies along the principal axes of the trap , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are annihilation operators for the quantized atomic motion and cavity field , respectively , @xmath10 is the atomic lowering operator , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is the ( possibly time - dependent ) amplitude of the laser field ; note again that we assume that this field has no spatial dependence along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "finally , the single - photon atom - cavity dipole coupling strength is given by @xmath14 , while the sine function describes the standing wave structure of the cavity field ( we assume that the centre of the trap is located at a _",
    "node _ of the cavity field ) , with @xmath15 the wavenumber of the field and @xmath16^{1/2 } ( \\hat{b}_x+\\hat{b}_x^\\dagger ) $ ] .    allowing for cavity damping and atomic spontaneous emission , quantum langevin equations for the system operators can be derived straightforwardly . for the moment",
    ", however , we will ignore the effects of atomic spontaneous emission on the grounds that the detunings of the laser and cavity fields from the atomic transition frequency are very large , and hence that population of the excited atomic state @xmath17 is negligible ( we will return to the effects of spontaneous emission in the discussion at the end of the paper ) . on this basis , we are also able to adiabatically eliminate the internal atomic dynamics from the problem .",
    "we will also ignore any forms of motional decoherence or heating associated with imperfections in the trap itself @xcite on the basis that such effects occur on a timescale slow compared with the operations we will be considering .",
    "again , we will return to this point and discuss it more quantitatively at the end of the paper .",
    "finally , we assume that the size of the harmonic trap ( in all directions ) is small compared to the optical wavelength ; under these conditions , we can make the approximation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the lamb - dicke parameter . given this assumption ,",
    "it is also possible to design a configuration for which we can neglect all position dependence in the laser field @xcite ; that is , we can assume a situation where @xmath21 [ with @xmath22 a real quantity ] .",
    "henceforth , the problem essentially becomes one - dimensional and we can restrict our attention to just the @xmath3 direction .",
    "to first order in @xmath19 , equations of motion for the operators @xmath9 and @xmath23 then follow as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the decay rate of the cavity field and @xmath26 is a quantum noise operator describing the input to the cavity field and satisfying the commutation relation @xmath27 = \\delta ( t - t^\\prime ) $ ] .",
    "we now make the transformation @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and choose @xmath30 ( i.e. , tune to the `` first lower sideband '' ) . assuming that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , the oscillating terms in the resulting equations may be dropped in a rotating - wave approximation to yield @xmath34 these equations simply describe a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators , one of which is damped . in terms of a hamiltonian , the coupling is given by [ defining @xmath35 ( real ) ] @xmath36 a result derived by zeng and lin @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by zeng and lin @xcite , when cavity losses can be neglected the above coupling enables complete ( pure or mixed ) state transfer between the atomic motion and the cavity light field .",
    "for example , given a finite laser pulse duration , and assuming for simplicity that @xmath22 is a real and positive function of time , then solutions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be derived as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "choosing @xmath41 , with @xmath42 an integer , and @xmath43 yields @xmath44 from which it follows that , given an initial vacuum state of the field , _ any initial state of the motion can be transferred one - to - one to the state of the cavity field _ and the motion is reduced to its ground state ( for other examples of this kind of state exchange between harmonic oscillator modes , see @xcite ) .",
    "the result derived above demonstrating the possibility of complete state transfer between the quantized atomic motion and the cavity field mode obviously offers some very interesting further possibilities .",
    "if the damping of the cavity mode is sufficiently weak , then one can imagine a situation in which a suitable laser pulse is applied so as to transfer a motional state to the cavity mode ( in a time short compared to @xmath45 ) , after which the cavity field is allowed to decay .",
    "making homodyne measurements on the output field from the cavity and using the well - established method of optical homodyne tomography @xcite , the density matrix of the cavity field mode , and hence of the initial motional state , could be reconstructed from many repeated cycles of preparation and measurement .",
    "given that the motion is always left in its ground state after the laser pulse , this can also be seen as a novel means of cooling , or `` resetting , '' the atomic motion in a single operation @xcite .",
    "of course , in the regime of operation that we are assuming ( the resolved sideband limit ) , conventional sideband cooling ( using atomic spontaneous emission ) would also be an efficient means of cooling the motion to the ground state .",
    "the opposite limit , in which @xmath25 is large compared to the magnitude of the effective coupling rate @xmath46 ( but , of course , still small compared to the trap frequency @xmath47 ) is actually of more interest to us and indeed allows further simplification of the model . in particular",
    ", we can consider adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode from the dynamics , i.e. , setting @xmath48 and substituting @xmath49 into the equation for @xmath50 to give @xmath51 ^ 2}{\\kappa } \\tilde{b}_x + \\omega ( t ) \\sqrt{2/\\kappa}\\ , \\tilde{a}_{\\rm in}(t )   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "& \\equiv & - \\gamma ( t ) \\tilde{b}_x + \\sqrt{2\\gamma ( t ) } \\ , \\tilde{a}_{\\rm in}(t)\\ ; , \\label{eq : btilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "this equation simply describes a quantum harmonic oscillator subject to damping at the ( possibly time - dependent ) rate @xmath53 . in the case of a vacuum cavity input field , it obviously models sideband cooling to the ground state due to a form of cavity - induced spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "however , one can also consider different kinds of inputs to the cavity field , i.e. , choices of the input field operator @xmath54 that give rise to nontrivial input field statistics .",
    "this is of interest because , given the simple linear form of ( [ eq : btilde ] ) , it follows that the statistics of the input field can be `` written onto '' the state of the oscillator . in particular , assuming that @xmath55 , a constant , then in frequency space the solution to ( [ eq : btilde ] ) is simply @xmath56    for example , the input field could be an _",
    "ideal quantum squeezed vacuum _ as derived from the output of a degenerate parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "if the squeezing happens to be broadband ( with respect to the characteristic rates associated with the system upon which it is incident ) , then the appropriate input field correlation functions can be written in the forms @xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "given such an input , the system is equivalently described by the master equation @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the density operator for the motion of the trapped atom . in steady state , the density operator is that of an ideal squeezed state , that is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the squeezing operator @xcite , i.e. , @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "there are of course other ways of preparing such nonclassical states of the motion which have indeed already been implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "these preparations have typically employed pulsed _",
    "classical _ light fields to facilitate the required motional state transformations .",
    "the above scheme is novel in that it involves the direct transfer of statistics from a _ nonclassical _ continuous - wave light field to the motional state of the trapped atom .      to numerically model state transfer between light and motion in the overdamped regime described above , we consider , as above , the cavity mode to be resonantly driven by squeezed light from a degenerate parametric oscillator , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "for our simulations , we include the dynamics of the parametric oscillator using the cascaded systems formalism developed in @xcite ( further applications of the formalism are given in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we model our system with the master equation @xmath67 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ , \\kappa_a \\left ( 2\\tilde{a}\\rho\\tilde{a}^\\dagger - \\tilde{a}^\\dagger\\tilde{a}\\rho - \\rho\\tilde{a}^\\dagger\\tilde{a }   \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ , \\kappa_c \\left ( 2\\tilde{c}\\rho\\tilde{c}^\\dagger - \\tilde{c}^\\dagger\\tilde{c}\\rho - \\rho\\tilde{c}^\\dagger\\tilde{c }   \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\ , 2\\sqrt{\\kappa_a\\kappa_c } \\ , \\left ( [ \\tilde{a}^\\dagger , \\tilde{c}\\rho ] + [ \\rho\\tilde{c}^\\dagger , \\tilde{a } ] \\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath68 describes the effective coupling between the vibrational motion of the trapped atom and the cavity light field as derived above .",
    "however , in addition we retain the rotating , or nonsecular terms , i.e. , we take @xmath69 the coupling parameter @xmath70 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath71 models the parametric oscillator ( driven below threshold ) , taking the form @xmath72 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode of the parametric oscillator and @xmath74 is the amplitude of the coherent field driving the oscillator .",
    "the linewidth of the ( one - sided ) parametric oscillator cavity mode is @xmath75 .",
    "finally , the last term in ( [ eq : sqme ] ) describes the ( unidirectional ) coupling of the incoming squeezed light to the cavity mode .",
    "this coupling is assumed to be ideal .    by using a truncated state basis , the master equation ( [ eq : sqme ] )",
    "is numerically propagated until a steady state is achieved .",
    "in fact , due to the time - dependent terms in @xmath68 , only a quasi - steady state can in principle be achieved , but for the parameters we consider only a very weak time - dependence ( i.e. , a weak modulation ) occurs .",
    "the elements of the reduced density matrix of the motional mode in the steady state ( @xmath76 ) are shown in fig .  3 for the choice of parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( corresponding to 71% maximum squeezing in the input light field ) .",
    "these parameters are in the regime for which the master equation ( [ eq : drhomdt ] ) should be valid and , indeed , we find the steady state of the motion to be approached on a timescale @xmath81 .",
    "characteristic squeezed state features are evident in the figure ( e.g. , only even number states are populated ) and the fidelity with which the predicted ideal squeezed state is achieved is computed to be @xmath82 for the appropriate values of @xmath42 and @xmath83 in the theory .",
    "the scheme outlined above can be extended to the transfer of quantum mechanical entanglement from light fields to motional states of two or more trapped atoms at physically separated sites .",
    "consider , for example , the pair of output fields from a _ nondegenerate parametric amplifier _ ( the fields may be nondegenerate in polarization or in frequency ) @xcite . at the output from the parametric amplifier , these fields",
    "could be separated in space and then made to impinge upon two cavities containing trapped atoms in the configuration described above .",
    "the quantum mechanical correlations that exist between the two light fields generated by parametric downconversion could thus be transferred ( in steady state ) to correlations between motional states of trapped atoms at two distinct sites .",
    "an exciting recent development in the field of quantum communication has been the experimental investigation of schemes for the teleportation of quantum states @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in the present context is the demonstration by furusawa _",
    "et al_. @xcite of unconditional quantum teleportation of optical coherent states using squeezed - state fields and entanglement of the sort discussed above . by incorporating cavities containing trapped ions in the state transfer configuration of this work ( in the bad cavity limit ) , it should be possible to employ the scheme of @xcite for the teleportation of _ motional _ states .",
    "in particular , a motional state could be `` mapped '' onto a light field which enters the configuration of @xcite at the `` sending '' station .",
    "this field is teleported to a `` receiving '' station where it is made to impinge upon a second trapped - ion plus cavity system in the state transfer configuration .",
    "the teleported light field is thus mapped onto the motional mode of the second trapped ion and teleportation of the motional state is completed .",
    "we will examine teleportation of motional states in more detail in a future work .",
    "given the variety of , and efficiency with which , nonclassical motional states of single trapped atoms have been experimentally realized @xcite , it is worth noting the potential of our scheme as a _ source _ of nonclassical output light fields .",
    "the output light field is related to the input and internal cavity fields by @xcite @xmath84 which in the overdamped limit becomes [ using ( [ adiab_elim ] ) ] @xmath85 where we assume that @xmath86 .",
    "hence , given a vacuum field input to the cavity , the output field is determined by the motional state of the trapped atom .",
    "further , depending on the nature of the motional state preparation , the output may be pulsed _ or _ continuous ; for a continuous output one would have @xmath55 , a constant , and the motional state preparation scheme would have to operate in a continuous manner also .",
    "as an example , consider squeezed motional states , which may be generated by applying an electric field gradient with a frequency @xmath87 to the ion @xcite , or by irradiating the ion with two laser beams differing in frequency by @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite squeezed states of the motion were produced exhibiting a reduction in the variance of the squeezed quadrature by a factor of 40 .",
    "such quadrature noise reduction has yet to be approached via traditional optical means , suggesting that the present state transfer configuration is worthy of further investigation @xcite .",
    "recently , cirac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) demonstrated how quantum transmission of a qubit between two nodes of a quantum network can be implemented in a physical system using light as the carrier of the quantum information . in particular",
    ", they showed how the transformation @xmath88 can be achieved where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are internal states of an atom at node 1 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the corresponding states of a second atom at ( the spatially separated ) node 2 . at each node",
    ", the atom is located within a cavity supporting a single mode of the electromagnetic field , with which it is made to undergo a controlled time - dependent interaction via a laser - assisted raman process",
    ". with suitably chosen laser pulses at the two nodes , the transmission described by ( [ qubittrans ] ) can be faithfully reproduced , facilitated by the transfer of a _ photon _ wave packet between the two nodes .    in the same spirit , we consider here the transmission of _ arbitrary motional states _ of trapped atoms between two distinct sites , facilitated once again by cavity light fields and photon wave packets .",
    "we consider two separated atom - cavity arrangements , each in the configuration described in section ii , so that the combined system hamiltonian can be written as @xmath93 where the subscripts @xmath94 denote the site of each atom or cavity mode and we now omit the subscript @xmath3 for simplicity .",
    "the two cavity modes are each damped at rate @xmath25 , but coupling between their external fields is assumed to be unidirectional . in particular , the output from cavity 1 is incident upon ( i.e. , provides the input field to ) cavity 2 , but not _",
    "vice versa_. such a situation is depicted in fig .",
    "4 and is again modeled by the cascaded systems formalism introduced earlier @xcite . in this formalism , the master equation for our system is derived in the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath97 + [ \\rho\\tilde{a}_1^\\dagger , \\tilde{a}_2 ] \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a vacuum input to the first cavity has been assumed . the last term in ( [ lc ] )",
    "provides the desired unidirectional coupling in the theory .    to simplify the model ,",
    "we assume , as before , that the decay rate @xmath25 is large compared to other rates in the system ( apart from the trap frequency @xmath98 ) and that the cavity fields can be adiabatically eliminated from the system dynamics . in the approach",
    "we are following in this section , this leads to a reduced master equation for the density operator of the motion of the two atoms , given formally by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the steady state density matrix for the two cavity modes . to evaluate this expression explicitly requires steady state correlation functions for the operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which can be derived from ( [ lc ] ) using the quantum regression theorem .",

    ", we again follow cirac _ et al . _ and employ the technique of quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "this technique simulates a given master equation by propagating a system wave function @xmath106 subject to a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian .",
    "this propagation is interrupted at random times @xmath107 by wave function collapses , or quantum jumps , @xmath108 , which can be interpreted as , in our particular instance , the emission and destructive detection of photons from the cavity fields .    for the master equation derived above ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian takes the form ( choosing the laser phases such that @xmath109 ) @xmath110 while the collapse operator is given by @xmath111    the basic idea is to design laser pulse profiles [ manifest through @xmath112 at the two sites such that the ideal quantum transmission @xmath113 can be achieved . here",
    "@xmath114 denotes the @xmath115-th fock state of the motion of atom @xmath116 .",
    "a necessary condition for successful transmission is that a quantum jump never occurs , i.e. , @xmath117 for all @xmath118 , in which case the effective hamiltonian becomes a hermitian operator .",

    "we choose , arbitrarily ( in practice we are somewhat limited by the size of the basis set we can use comfortably in our simulations ) , @xmath148 so that the initial state of the total system is @xmath149 the transmission fidelity , which we define by @xmath150 is plotted in fig .  5 for @xmath151 ( corresponding to @xmath152 ) and three different values of the trap frequency @xmath98 .",

    "the state is transmitted with a fidelity of 0.995 ( 0.980 ) . as @xmath157 is lowered the fidelity",
    "is reduced as the rotating terms in the effective hamiltonians @xmath158 begin to contribute more strongly to the dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , a fidelity of 0.925 is found even for @xmath159 .    in fig .",
    "6 we consider a single value of the trap frequency , @xmath155 , but now vary the coupling parameter @xmath70 , which varies the effective rate @xmath135 of the state transfer operation .",
    "we also choose larger values of @xmath70 compared to @xmath25 to assess how well the chosen pulse shapes drive the state transfer as the adiabatic approximation ( @xmath160 ) ceases to be valid .",
    "as one can see , the fidelity of the transmission remains high even with @xmath161 ( 0.984 ) and @xmath162 ( 0.970 ) , but at @xmath163 deteriorates to 0.905 .",
    "notably , the timescales for the transfer are significantly faster than in the previous figure , which is possibly advantageous from an experimental point of view .",
    "the overdamped regime considered above probably corresponds to the most likely experimental scenario .",
    "however , a situation where @xmath164 is still possible and could offer some further advantages in terms of transfer rates , which , in such a regime , would be of the order of @xmath25 . of course , if @xmath164 then one must include the cavity modes and their dynamics in the analysis , which thereby becomes somewhat more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , we find that it is still possible to derive pulse shapes that allow high - fidelity transmission of arbitrary quantum states .",
    "in particular , following the kind of approach used in @xcite , whereby one assumes that @xmath165 ( a constant ) for @xmath166 and that @xmath167 ( i.e. , the _ symmetric pulse condition _ ) , we are able to arrive at the form @xmath168 where @xmath169 with @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 that such forms for the pulse shapes can successfully facilitate state transmission between the two atoms is illustrated by the dotted line in fig .  6 for the same state @xmath154 considered above and with @xmath163 .",
    "the state is transmitted with a fidelity of 0.993 , clearly improving on the result from the approach in the overdamped regime and also doing so on a faster timescale .",
    "in this paper we have described schemes for the transfer of quite general quantum states between light fields and atomic motion and between the motion of trapped atoms at separate sites .",
    "we want now to consider in more detail some of the basic assumptions involved in our model and to examine possible experimental situations .    clearly , a very important assumption is that the effects of atomic spontaneous emission can be neglected . in a master equation approach , atomic spontaneous emission with the effects of recoil taken into account",
    "is modelled by a term of the form ( considering motion only along the @xmath3 axis ) @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 here , @xmath175 is the spontaneous emission rate and @xmath176 describes the angular distribution of spontaneous emission for an atomic dipole transition . incorporating this into our analysis and adiabatically eliminating the atomic and cavity degrees of freedom as before",

    "hence , in order to be able to neglect the effects of spontaneous emission on the transfer process , we require that @xmath180 this , not surprisingly , corresponds to the regime of strong - coupling in cavity qed @xcite .",
    "the dipole coupling strength is given by @xmath181^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath182 is the wavelength of the atomic transition and @xmath183 is the cavity mode volume , with @xmath184 the cavity mode waist and @xmath185 the mirror separation .",
    "the cavity field decay rate can be expressed in terms of the mirror separation and the cavity finesse @xmath186 as @xmath187 . using these expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath25",
    ", the condition in ( [ specondition ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath188 so , of course , one would like to have small cavity modes and high finesse mirrors .",
    "the trap itself must also meet rather stringent requirements ; in particular , the lamb - dicke parameter must satisfy @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) and the trap frequency along the @xmath3 axis must satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "let us now consider a specific example from the ion - trapping community : the trapped ion species @xmath191 .",
    "recent experiments with this particular ion ( see , for example , @xcite ) have been performed with harmonic oscillation frequencies along the principal axes of the trap @xmath192 , corresponding to lamb - dicke parameters @xmath193 ( with respect to the @xmath194 transition at wavelength @xmath195 ; the linewidth for this transition is @xmath196 ) .",
    "a further practical consideration is the requirement that the spacing between the mirrors be large enough to accommodate the ion trap electrodes and external laser fields .",
    "a reasonable minimum separation might be @xmath197 , but we shall make a somewhat more conservative choice of @xmath198 . with a cavity finesse @xmath199 @xcite ,",

    "if the radius of curvature of the mirrors is taken to be 5 cm , then the cavity waist takes the value @xmath204 ( which yields @xmath205 ) and @xmath206 .    finally , given these choices of parameters , a numerical estimate for the rate @xmath207 at which the state transfer occurs in the overdamped regime would be @xmath208 , and even larger with suitable laser pulse shapes in the underdamped regime .",
    "this estimate establishes a timescale for the required stability of the driving laser fields ( remember that the phases of the two laser fields are assumed to be equal for the duration of the state transfer process ) and of the cavity and trap setups .",
    "note that the timescales for motional decoherence and heating observed in recent trapped ion experiments ( with @xmath191 ) are of the order of milliseconds and further improvement seems possible @xcite .",
    "so , it would seem that , with quite reasonable choices of experimental parameters , a suitable operating regime for the state transfer scheme is feasible . note that favorable parameters should also be achievable with trapped - ion species other than @xmath191 ; for example , @xmath209 or @xmath210 . alternatively ,",
    "recent developments with microscopic magnetic traps @xcite suggest that suitably large trap frequencies and confinement in the lamb - dicke regime may also be possible with neutral atoms , such as li and k.    to conclude , in this work we have described a means of usefully combining several emerging candidate technologies for the implementation of quantum communication and computing , i.e. , trapped atoms , cavity qed , and propagating ( nonclassical ) light fields .",
    "the schemes outlined above allow , in principle , for the transfer of quantum states and entanglement between light fields and motional degrees of freedom of trapped atoms and for high - fidelity transmission of quantum states between spatially distant sites .",

    "further , to realize an essentially one - sided cavity , as assumed throughout our work , we require the transmission of one mirror to be much larger than that of the second . mirror transmission and scatter and absorption losses of the order of 1 ppm have been reported by g. rempe _ et al_. , opt .",
