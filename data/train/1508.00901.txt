    "@xcite for detailed reviews .",
    "the comparison of the precise measurements and calculations shows a deviation of about three standard deviations , which already persists for several years .",

    "the dominant contribution to the uncertainty comes from the hadronic contribution which can be split into a vacuum polarization and light - by - light contribution .",

    "the linear and quadratic term , however , can still lead to sizable contributions since the coefficients of @xmath20 contain @xmath21 terms which at four - loop order are raised up to forth power .",
    "we have implemented the asymptotic expansion using two different programs . in the first approach we use the mathematica package asy  @xcite which is based on expansion by regions  @xcite formulated at the level of the alpha representation  @xcite .",
    "it provides the possibility to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of a feynman diagram in a given limit .",
    "in fact , the output of asy are scaling rules for the alpha parameters . to exploit this information one has to find a distribution of the external momentum and the loop momenta obeying certain scaling rules which we obtain by trying out all possible combinations .",
    "the second approach is based on an in - house program which generates all possible combinations of loop momenta and external momentum and assigns for each combination all possible scalings of the loop momenta ( i.e. each loop momentum can either be soft or hard ) . in this way one",
    "obtains by construction all contributing regions .",
    "however , a double counting is introduced since the routing of the loop momenta is not unique .",
    "the double counting is eliminated with the help of the unique alpha representation which is generated for each momentum distribution .",
    "we have applied both methods to each feynman diagram and have obtained identical final results .",

    "the remaining three regions , i.e. two soft and one hard loop momentum , leads to one - loop on - shell integrals and either vacuum or linear integrals where the massive scale is given by the electron mass .",
