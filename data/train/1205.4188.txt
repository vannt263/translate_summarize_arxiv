    "the distance is comparatively nearby ( @xmath21.1 kpc ; @xcite ) and its large apparent size ( @xmath2100  in diameter ) enables us to study the detailed plasma structure . while g156.2 + 5.7 is one of the brightest snrs in x - rays , its radio emission is quite faint ; this is its most remarkable feature . shortly after its discovery in x - rays ,",
    "the radio continuum emission was also detected with the effelsberg 100-m telescope @xcite . as they point out ,",
    "the surface brightness at 1 ghz ( 5.8@xmath310@xmath4 w m@xmath5 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 ) is the lowest among all the known snrs .",
    "the radio morphology along the northwest and southeast rim shows limb brightening ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that is typically seen in so - called `` barrel - shaped '' snrs @xcite .",
    "in contrast to its radio morphology , g156.2 + 5.7 has centrally - filled thermal emission in x - rays .",
    "while @xcite lists g156.2 + 5.7 as a mixed - morphology ( mm ) snr for this reason , it does not fit the definition of mm snrs in several ways : the x - ray shell is easily distinguishable and there are neither co clouds nor oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers in its vicinity .",
    "a recent optical observation suggests that the distance to g156.2 + 5.7 is smaller than that previously estimated @xcite .",
    "their main argument is that several bright h@xmath6 filaments correlate with nearby interstellar clouds ( @xmath20.3 kpc ) .",
    "however , the x - ray and the radio observations both agree that g156.2 + 5.7 is located at 1 - 3 kpc , i.e. , an evolved snr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we report an x - ray study of the evolved galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g156.2 + 5.7 based on six pointing observations with suzaku . </S>",
    "<S> the remnant s large extent ( 100@xmath0 in diameter ) allows us to investigate its radial structure in the northwestern and eastern directions from the apparent center . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra were well fit with a two - component non - equilibrium ionization model representing the swept - up interstellar medium ( ism ) and the metal - rich ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we found prominent central concentrations of si , s and fe from the ejecta component ; the lighter elements of o , ne and mg were distributed more uniformly . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the ism component suggests a slow shock ( 610 - 960 km s@xmath1 ) , hence the remnant s age is estimated to be 7,000 - 15,000 yr , assuming its distance to be @xmath21.1 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> g156.2 + 5.7 has also been thought to emit hard , non - thermal x - rays , despite being considerably older than any other such remnant . in response to a recent discovery of a background cluster of galaxies ( 2xmm j045637.2 + 522411 ) , we carefully excluded its contribution , and reexamined the origin of the hard x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the residual hard x - ray emission is consistent with the expected level of the cosmic x - ray background . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no robust evidence for the non - thermal emission was obtained from g156.2 + 5.7 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the picture of an evolved snr . </S>"
