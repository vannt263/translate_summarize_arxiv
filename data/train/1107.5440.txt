    "the model considered is the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where the first and the second sums are taken over all nn and nnn pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig.[fig_pyro ] ) , respectively .",
    "we suppose the antiferromagnetic nn interaction @xmath11 and the ferromagnetic nnn interaction @xmath6 ( @xmath0-@xmath1 model ) , and @xmath12 to be the length of the cubic unit cell .",
    "note that the pyrochlore lattice , which can be viewed as an fcc lattice formed by regular tetrahedra of a fixed orientation , is a non - bravais lattice .",
    "the ordering of this @xmath0-@xmath1 model was first studied by reimers _",
    "based on a mean - field approximation . there",
    ", the full density matrix of the system was approximated by a product of single spin density matrices with local effective fields which were determined so as to minimize the free energy .",
    "_ found that the model exhibited a phase transition from the paramagnetic phase to a magnetically ordered phase , where the magnetic long range order was characterized by twelve incommensurate wavevectors of the fcc bravais lattice : @xmath13,@xmath14 , @xmath15,@xmath16 , @xmath17,@xmath18 and their minus , with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "since the pyrochlore lattice consists of four fcc sublattices , each wavevector has four independent eigenmodes and only a certain combination of them becomes unstable at the transition point .",
    "in fact , there are infinitely many ways to mix such twelve critical modes .",
    "thus , just the determination of unstable modes is not enough to specify the explicit spin configuration of the ordered phase .",
    "indeed , reimers _",
    "_ did not determine the ordered spin configuration , nor specified even whether it was a single-@xmath3 state or a multiple-@xmath3 state .",
    "multiple-@xmath3 state is generally incompatible with the fixed spin - length condition",
    "@xmath20 so that it is not favored in the classical spin system at low enough temperatures where the fixed spin - length condition needs to be observed .",
    "meanwhile , the unstable critical mode of the present model entails the magnitudes of frozen spin moments differ from one sublattice to the other so that even a simple single-@xmath3 state is incompatible with the fixed spin - length condition .",
    "it means that the multiple-@xmath3 state might have a higher chance to be stabilized , particularly at moderate temperatures where thermal fluctuations play a role .",
    "as mentioned , a multiple-@xmath3 ordered state characterized by multiple bragg peaks in the spin structure factor was reported in previous mc simulations on the model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , tsuneishi _ et al .",
    "_ also reported that this multiple-@xmath3 ordered state accompanies only small amount of spin freezing , and some sort of spin fluctuations apparently coexisted with sharp bragg peaks .",
    "the detailed spin structure of the multiple-@xmath3 state , however , has not been clarified so far .",
    "especially , the origin of the spin fluctuation reported by tsuneishi _",
    "_ remains unsolved .",
    "chern _ et al .",
    "_ reported that yet another phase , a partially ordered collinear phase , might be realized between the paramagnetic phase and the multiple-@xmath3 phase for sufficiently small values of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this partially ordered collinear phase is characterized by a finite nematic order parameter and a layered spin structure .",
    "note that this phase is different from the multiple-@xmath3 ordered phase discussed above where the system retains a magnetic long range - order characterized by sharp bragg peaks .",
    "although the partially ordered collinear phase as discussed by chern _ et al .",
    "_ is also interesting , we focus in the present paper on the nature of the multiple-@xmath3 ordered state and of the associated fluctuations in the multiple-@xmath3 ordered phase .",
    "in studying the nature of the multiple-@xmath3 ordered state , we begin by revisiting a mean - field analysis done earlier by reimers _",
    "constructed a landau - type free energy @xmath22 of the pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet within a mean - field approximation up to the quartic order , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the order parameter corresponding to the fourier magnetization of sublattice @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spin at the site @xmath29 belonging to sublattice @xmath25 , @xmath30 is the position vector of that site and @xmath31 is the number of spins belonging to sublattice @xmath25 .",
    "the sum @xmath32 runs over all @xmath33s which satisfy @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the fourier transform of the exchange interaction between sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath36 .",

    "is reduced to @xmath42    from the quadratic term of the free - energy expansion , one sees that the normal mode corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath43 becomes unstable at @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the critical wavevector , leading to a phase transition to the ordered state characterized by the wavevector @xmath45 .",
    "when the maximum eigenvalue is degenerate as in the present case , the ordered - state spin configuration still remains largely undetermined at the quadratic level .",
    "in such a case , there are infinitely many ways of mixing @xmath46s with keeping the order parameter @xmath47 constant . in order to specify the explicit ordered - state spin configuration",

    "hence , even a pure single-@xmath3 state can not be realized at @xmath61 as in multiple-@xmath3 states , though it might be realized at finite temperatures due to thermal fluctuations .    due to",
    "the cubic symmetry of the pyrochlore lattice , @xmath62 is twelvefold degenerate .",
    "hence , a variety of multiple-@xmath3 states might be possible in principle . even if one is to identify two eigenmodes corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , there are still six independent eigenmodes . within the landau - type free - energy expansion ,",
