    "precision measurements of gauge boson self - interactions at the lhc will be the crucial test of the @xmath3 gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "any deviation of the couplings from the sm expectations would indicate the existence of new physics .",
    "it is very common to investigate the new physics via effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the theoretical basis of such an approach rely on the assumption that at higher energies beyond the sm , there is a more fundamental theory which reduces to the sm at lower energies .",
    "hence , sm is assumed to be an effective low - energy theory in which heavy fields have been integrated out .",
    "such a procedure is quite general and independent of the details of the model .",
    "for this reason this approach is sometimes called model independent analysis .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed genuine quartic @xmath0 couplings via single z boson production in a @xmath4-proton collision at the lhc .",
    "genuine quartic couplings have different origins than anomalous trilinear couplings .",
    "they arise from effective operators that do not induce any trilinear gauge boson coupling . hence , genuine quartic couplings are free from constraints on trilinear couplings . imposing custodial @xmath5 symmetry and local @xmath6 symmetry ,",
    "c and p conserving dimension 6 effective lagrangian for @xmath0 couplings are given by @xcite , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath5 triplet , and @xmath11 is the electromagnetic field strength . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dimensionless anomalous coupling constants and @xmath14 is the scale of new physics .",
    "the vertex functions generated from the effective lagrangians ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are given respectively by @xcite @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momenta of photons and for a convention , we assume that all the momenta are incoming to the vertex .",
    "the current best limits on @xmath0 couplings are provided by the opal collaboration .",
    "these are @xmath19 at 95% c.l . @xcite .",
    "studying photon - induced reactions in a hadron collider is not a very new phenomena .",
    "the reactions such as @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite were verified experimentally by the cdf collaboration at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "these results raise interest on the potential of lhc as a photon - photon and photon - proton collider . probing new physics via photon - induced reactions at the lhc",
    "is common in the literature .",
    "phenomenological studies involve : supersymmetry , extradimensions , unparticle physics , gauge boson self - interactions , neutrino electromagnetic properties etc . @xcite .",
    "a quasireal photon emitted from one proton beam can interact with the quarks of the other proton and the subprocess @xmath23 can occur at the lhc .",
    "emitted quasireal photons are described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite .",
    "their virtuality is very low and it is a good approximation to assume that they are on - mass - shell .",
    "therefore to some extent it is possible to study @xmath4-proton collision at the lhc . a schematic diagram describing this process is given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "any process in a @xmath4-proton collision can be discerned from pure deep inelastic scattering processes by means of two experimental signatures @xcite : first signature is the forward large - rapidity gap .",
    "quasireal photons have a low virtuality and scattered with small angles from the beam pipe .",
    "since the transverse momentum carried by a quasireal photon is small , photon emitting intact protons should also be scattered with small angles and exit the central detector without being detected .",
    "this causes a decrease in the energy deposit in the corresponding forward region compared to the case in which the proton remnants are detected by the calorimeters . as a result of this ,",
    "one of the forward regions of the central detector has a significant lack of energy .",
    "this defines the forward large - rapidity gap and usual pp deep inelastic processes can be rejected by applying a selection cut on this quantity .",
    "second experimental signature is provided by the forward detectors .",
    "forward detectors are capable to detect particles with a large pseudorapidity .",
    "when a photon emitting intact proton is scattered with a large pseudorapidity , it exceeds the pseudorapidity coverage of the central detectors .",
    "the detection of this intact proton by the forward detectors provides a distinctive signal for the @xmath4-proton collision .",
    "@xmath24 collision can also be studied in the framework of epa .",
    "in fact , these two - photon processes are much more studied at the lhc .",
    "two - photon processes provide a more clean environment with respect to @xmath4-proton processes due to absence of the remnants of both proton beams .",
    "moreover two - photon processes are generally electroweak in nature and they are mostly free from backgrounds coming from strong interactions .",
    "it is more probable for strong interactions that take part in a @xmath4-proton process rather than in a two - photon process .",
    "hence , two - photon processes generally have less backgrounds compared to @xmath4-proton processes . on the other hand , for @xmath4-proton processes energy reach and effective luminosity are much higher than for two - photon processes @xcite .",
    "this feature might be important in probing new physics especially when the energy dependences of the anomalous cross sections are very high .",
    "for instance , anomalous @xmath0 couplings are described by effective lagrangians ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) which have an energy dimension of 6",
    ". therefore anomalous cross section containing the @xmath0 vertex has a higher momentum dependence than the sm cross section . from a simple dimensional analysis",
    "we deduce that its momentum dependence is higher up to a factor of @xmath25 than the sm cross section where @xmath26 is the momentum incoming ( or outgoing ) to the vertex .",
    "thus , new physics contribution to the cross section rapidly increases when the center - of - mass energy increases and the processes which have a higher energy reach are expected to have a high sensitivity to new physics .",
    "another factor which has to be considered in a @xmath4-proton or a @xmath24 collision is the survival probability .",
    "it is basically defined as the probability of the scattered protons not to dissociate due to the secondary soft interactions @xcite . in the @xmath4-proton collision with quasireal photons virtuality of photons",
    "is very small . in the epa that we have considered typical photon virtuality",
    "is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "therefore proton impact parameter is much bigger than the range of strong interactions and proton survival probability is expected to be large . on the other hand , the survival probability for a @xmath4-proton process is usually smaller than for a two - photon process @xcite",
    ".    atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located at distances of 220 m and 420 m from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "these forward detectors have a capability to detect intact scattered protons with momentum fraction loss in the interval @xmath28 which is called the acceptance of the forward detectors .",
    "the acceptance proposed by the atlas forward physics ( afp ) collaboration is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the acceptance of the forward detectors in cms is similar .",
    "there are also other scenarios with different acceptances .",
    "cms - totem forward detector scenario spans @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath31 takes part as a subprocess in the main reaction @xmath32 .",
    "we consider totaly 10 subprocesses for different type of quarks and anti - quarks : @xmath33 each of the subprocesses is described by seven tree - level diagrams(fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we see from fig.[fig2 ] that one of them contains anomalous @xmath0 vertex and others are sm contributions .",
    "the cross section for the main process @xmath34 can be obtained by integrating the cross sections for the subprocesses over the photon and quark spectra : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fraction which represents the ratio between the scattered equivalent photon and initial proton energy and @xmath37 is the momentum fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the quark .",
    "@xmath38 is the equivalent photon spectrum ( see appendix ) and @xmath39 is the quark distribution function of the proton .",
    "the summations in ( [ crossection ] ) are performed over subprocesses in ( [ subprocesses ] ) .",
    "the second integral in ( [ crossection ] ) is obtained by transforming the differentials @xmath40 into @xmath41 with a jacobian determinant @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the total mass of the final particles of the subprocess @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath45 is @xmath39 evaluated at @xmath46 . at high energies greater than proton mass , @xmath47 holds .",
    "therefore it is a good approximation to assume that @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the first integral in ( [ crossection ] ) . during calculations ,",
    "the virtuality of the quark is taken to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of the z boson . in our calculations",
    "parton distribution functions of martin , stirling , thorne and watt @xcite have been used .    in figs.[fig3 ] and",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the total cross section of the process @xmath32 as a function of anomalous couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the acceptances of @xmath30 and @xmath54 .",
    "we observe from these figures that cross sections are large for @xmath30 compared with @xmath29 as expected .",
    "we also see from these figures that , deviation of the anomalous cross section from its sm value is larger for the coupling @xmath52 than @xmath53",
    ". therefore sensitivity limits on the coupling @xmath52 are expected to be more restricted than the limits on @xmath55 .    in all results presented in this paper",
    "we assume that center - of - mass energy of the proton - proton system is @xmath56 tev and cross sections have evaluated numerically by a computer code grace @xcite .",
    "during statistical analysis we use two different method . we employ a simple one - parameter @xmath57 test when the number of sm events is greater than 10 . on the other hand",
    ", we employ a poisson distribution when the number of sm events is less than or equal to 10 . for afp and cms - totem scenarios",
    "sm cross sections for the main reaction @xmath58 are 0.0046 pb and 0.0047 pb respectively .",
    "hence , the number of sm events exceeds 10 for integrated luminosities which are equal or greater than @xmath59 .",
    "therefore for afp and cms - totem scenarios we employ both type of the statistical analysis depending on the luminosity .",
    "forward detectors have a capability to detect protons in a continuous range of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore one can impose some cuts and choose to work in a subinterval of the whole acceptance region . imposing such cuts on forward detector acceptance is useful in suppressing the sm contribution .",
    "in addition to afp and cms - totem scenarios we will consider @xmath61 and @xmath62 subintervals of the whole afp and cms - totem acceptance regions . for these acceptances the number of sm events is less than 10 .",
    "therefore it is very appropriate to set bounds on the couplings using a poisson distribution .    for the acceptances of @xmath63 and @xmath64 with a high luminosity , @xmath57 analysis is performed .",
    "the @xmath57 function is defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the cross section containing new physics effects and @xmath67 is the statistical error .",
    "the expected number of events has been calculated considering the leptonic decay channel of the z boson as the signal @xmath68 , where @xmath69 or @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath72 is the jet reconstruction efficiency and @xmath73 is the survival probability factor .",
    "we have taken into account a jet reconstruction efficiency of @xmath74 and survival probability factor of @xmath75 .",
    "this survival probability factor was proposed for the single w boson photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we assume that same survival factor is valid for our process .",
    "atlas and cms have central detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we place a cut of @xmath76 for final state particles .",
    "moreover , we also demand that the transverse momenta of the final state photon and quark are greater than 15 gev . for the acceptances of @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ", we employ a poisson distribution .",
    "sensitivity limits are obtained assuming the number of observed events equal to the sm prediction , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "upper limits of number of events @xmath78 at the 95% c.l . can be calculated from the formula @xcite @xmath79 depending on the number of observed events , values for upper limits @xmath78 can be found in table 33.3 in ref.@xcite . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present number of observed events and upper limits of number of events for the cases in which the poisson distribution has been used . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] the calculated @xmath80 values are rounded to the nearest integer . for instance , for forward detector acceptance of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and 1.38 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "both of the @xmath80 values have been rounded to 1 .",
    "the upper limits of number of events @xmath78 can be directly converted to the limits of anomalous couplings @xmath52 and @xmath85 . in tables",
    "[ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] , we show 95% c.l .",
    "sensitivity limits on the anomalous couplings @xmath86 and @xmath87 for various integrated luminosities and forward detector acceptances of @xmath63 , @xmath81 , @xmath64 and @xmath88 .",
    "we see from tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] that our limits are at the order of @xmath2 and limits on the coupling @xmath52 are more restricted than the limits on @xmath55 .",
    "in this paper we considered all tree - level sm contributions for the subprocess @xmath31 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "these constitute major sm contributions .",
    "any other sm contribution coming to this subprocess is at the loop level and can be neglected compared to tree - level sm contributions",
    ". the leading order background process might be the pomeron exchange .",
    "a pomeron emitted from one proton beam can interact with the quarks of the other proton and same final state can occur .",
    "but when we analyze in detail we see that this background process is expected to has a minor influence on sensitivity bounds . in the deep inelastic scattering",
    "the virtuality of the struck quark is very high . during calculations in this paper , the virtuality of the struck quark",
    "is taken to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of the z boson .",
    "therefore , when a pomeron strikes a quark it probably dissociates into partons .",
    "these pomeron remnants can be detected by the calorimeters and background from pomeron exchange can be eliminated .",
    "furthermore , survival probability for a pomeron exchange is considerably smaller than that for a photon exchange .",
    "hence , even if the background from pomeron exchange can not be eliminated , it can not be much bigger ( probably smaller ) than the tree - level sm contributions for the photon exchange .",
    "finally we would like to stress that our bounds are not very sensitive to backgrounds .",
    "for instance , if we assume that background cross section is 2 times bigger than the tree - level sm contributions , our limits with a 200@xmath89 luminosity are spoiled approximately a factor of 1.5 for @xmath81 and a factor of 1.3 for @xmath63 .",
    "the process @xmath32 at the lhc with a center - of - mass energy of 14 tev probes anomalous quartic @xmath0 couplings with a far better sensitivity than the current experimental bounds .",
    "it allows to improve the current sensitivity by almost four orders of magnitude .",
    "the potential of lhc to probe anomalous quartic @xmath0 couplings was examined via weak boson fusion processes @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite and photon - photon fusion process @xmath92 @xcite . in papers @xcite authors considered semi - leptonic decay channel of the final z bosons , i.e. , @xmath93 where @xmath94 refers to jets . on the other hand in papers @xcite authors considered fully - leptonic decay channel of the final z bosons .",
    "the bounds obtained in @xcite are considerably weaker than the bounds obtained in papers @xcite .",
    "this probably originates from the fact that semi - leptonic decay channel of the final z bosons has a large branching ratio compared to fully - leptonic decay channel . in our paper",
    "we have considered leptonic decay channel of final z. therefore it is more appropriate to compare our bounds with the bounds obtained in @xcite .",
    "the bounds obtained in @xcite are of the same order as our bounds .",
    "anomalous quartic @xmath0 couplings were also studied for future international linear collider ( ilc ) and its operating modes of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the limits expected to be obtained for such a machine are comparable with the lhc bounds @xcite .",
