    "distribution of entanglement in a multipartite quantum system is known to be a useful resource in several quantum communication and quantum computational tasks @xcite .",
    "notable ones include quantum secret sharing @xcite , distributed quantum dense coding @xcite , distribution and concentration of quantum state @xcite , and cluster state quantum computing @xcite .",
    "such protocols have successfully been realized in physical systems like photons @xcite , ions @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers @xcite , etc",
    ". one of the physical systems in which quantum information tasks have been realized in the laboratory is the class of continuous variable ( cv ) systems .",
    "historically , the notion of the quantum correlated state of two particles in cv systems first arrived in the seminal paper of einstein , podolosky , and rosen in 1935 @xcite . in recent years",
    ", several communications schemes like teleportation @xcite and classical information transfer by quantum channels @xcite , have extensively been investigated both theoretically and experimentally , in cv systems , especially in gaussian states @xcite .",
    "however , it has been discovered that there are several protocols which can not be implemented using gaussian states with gaussian operations .",
    "examples include entanglement distillation @xcite , measurement - based universal quantum computation @xcite , teleportation @xcite , and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the increasing importance of non - gaussian states have led to the discovery of several mechanisms to create such states in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "an important one is adding and subtracting photons , when the initial state is the squeezed vacuum state .",
    "starting with the single mode squeezed vacuum state , whose wigner function @xcite is always positive , it was shown that photon addition can generate a negative dip of the wigner function in the phase space @xcite and hence can deviate from being a gaussian state . in case of the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state as input state , both entanglement and fidelity of teleportation can be increased by adding and subtracting photons to ( from ) one or two modes @xcite . for such experiments ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the entanglement content of the photon - added state obtained from the tmsv state was shown to be always higher than that of the photon - subtracted state @xcite .",
    "investigations of the squeezed vacuum state with respect to photon addition and subtraction are usually restricted to the two - mode case , even though the importance of multimode cv system is unquestionable . in this paper",
    ", we consider the four - mode squeezed vacuum ( fmsv ) state as input and degaussify it by adding and subtracting photons in different modes .",
    "we evaluate entanglement between different modes in all possible bipartitions and compare the results of the photon - added state with the subtracted ones .",
    "we call a mode as `` spectator '' mode in which either no photon or fixed number of photons are added ( subtracted ) .",
    "the other modes are referred to as `` players '' .",
    "we here investigate two scenarios ",
    "@xmath0 one player mode @xmath1 two player modes .",
    "we analytically show that in the single player case i.e. , when photons have been added ( subtracted ) to ( from ) a single mode , in the player : spectator bipartition , entanglements of the photon - added and -subtracted states coincide . in this situation , we prove that entanglements in both photon - added and -subtracted states monotonically increase with the number of photons added or subtracted . unlike the tmsv case , we observe that there exists scenarios in which photon - subtracted output states obtained by subtracting photons from one or two modes contain higher entanglement , compared to the photon - added state . specifically , we find that the photon - subtracted state contains more entanglement in the spectator : rest bipartition than that of the photon - added state , when a single mode acts as a player .",
    "similar hierarchy can also be obtained when any two modes act as players .",
    "interestingly , the advantageous situation for photon subtraction can be reversed by adding fixed number of photons in the spectator modes .",
    "such behavior can also be viewed by analyzing logarithmic negativity of the output two party state which can be obtained by discarding either two player modes or two spectator modes .",
    "finally , we study a distance - based measure of non - gaussianity in these scenarios and find that the non - gaussianity in general is higher for the photon - added state than that of the photon - subtracted state . in case of two modes , photon - added states are known to be more non - gaussian than the photon - subtracted states .",
    "however , as already noticed in @xcite , the relation between entanglement and non - gaussianity is not straightforward . in the four - mode case",
    ", we again find that the photon - added state has always higher non - gaussianity than that of the photon - subtracted states , and hence reflects that entanglement and non - gaussianity are possibly not directly connected .",

    "these states are examples of entangled states in continuous variables which can be used in various quantum information tasks . to define such states , let us first denote the bosonic creation and annihilation operators at the mode @xmath3 , as @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , which satisfy the bosonic commutation relations , @xmath6 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath7 = 0 $ ] , @xmath8 = 0 $ ] .",

    "( [ eq : nmodesq_def ] ) , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 thus , the tmsv state with @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , is the occupation number state .",
    "taking @xmath37 as the initial state , the behavior of entanglement and non - gaussianity after adding or subtracting photons , have extensively been investigated @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the fmsv state obtained by setting @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmodesq_def ] ) .",

    "in this paper , we consider the fmsv state , @xmath44 , as an initial state and our aim is to find the characteristics of its entanglement and the measure of non - gaussianity after adding and subtracting a finite number of photons .",
    "suppose @xmath2 number of photons are added at each mode @xmath3 , with @xmath45 then the output four - mode ( fm ) state reads as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the normalization constant .",
    "similarly , after subtracting @xmath48 number of photons from each mode of the fmsv state , the resulting state is given by @xmath49 is the normalization constant , and @xmath50 .",
    "the negative wigner function of a given state indicates the non - classical nature of the corresponding state while the positivity implies the opposite . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the wigner function of a gaussian state is always positive @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can define a measure of non - gaussianity or non - classicality by measuring the departure of a given state , @xmath51 , in a cv system from a gaussian state . in terms of relative entropy distance ,",

    "however , measures of quantum correlation in a multipartite scenario , both in discrete and cv systems are limited @xcite . to characterize entanglement in cv system with multiple modes ,",
    "one possibility is to compute von - neumann entropy in different bipartition of modes .",
    "another possibility is to study logarithmic negativity of two modes which can be obtained after discarding all the modes except two . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the local von neumann entropy and the logarithmic negativity in cv systems .",

    "entanglement is difficult to characterize even for pure states @xcite .",
    "however , if one divides a multipartite system into two blocks , then the entanglement between the two subsystems is the von neumann entropy of one of the block , provided the system is in a pure state .",
    "the entanglement between two blocks of a multiparty state can capture entanglement distribution in the multipartite domain .",
    "such a quantification has been extensively used in many - body systems @xcite . here",

    "the only difference is that entanglement of the subtracted state is always better than that of the added state when spectator modes are inactive .",
    "the picture changes , i.e. entanglement of the photon - added states starts increasing faster than the photon - subtracted states , like in the preceding cases , when fixed numbers of photons are added ( subtracted ) in the spectator mode(s ) .      we will now consider the case where , we still keep two modes as players but we now divide four - modes into two blocks consisting of two modes instead of one mode in the preceding discussion . in this case , the two nontrivial bipartitions are @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "let us first concentrate on the bipartition @xmath126 . in this case ,",
    "the symmetry of the fmsv state after addition or subtraction of arbitrary number of photons in all the modes , given in eqs . ( [ eq : photon_add_def ] ) and ( [ eq : photon_sub_def ] ) , ensures that there are only two nontrivial situations in the case of two player modes ( see fig .",

    "( [ eq : photon_sub_def ] ) .    if the first and second modes act as players , we find that subtraction is always better than addition for arbitrary values of @xmath84 and @xmath123 .",
    "this case is similar to the case with a single mode being player and cases with second and third modes or second and fourth modes being players .    .",
    "in ( a ) , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , while in ( b ) , @xmath187 .",
    "we see that spectator modes help to enhance entanglement in the photon - added state . ]    to show once more that spectators play a fundamental role in interchanging the entanglement property for photon addition and subtraction , we elaborate the analysis in two scenarios  ( 1 ) when a fixed number of photons are added ( subtracted ) in a single spectator mode , a positive region emerges , which indicates that the quantum correlation in the @xmath126 bipartition is greater for photon addition than that for subtraction , as already seen before .",
    "an interesting point to note here is that a positive region appears for small values of @xmath123 and almost for all values of @xmath84 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that we add photons in the third mode which belongs to the same block as the first mode .",
    "( 2 ) when both the spectator modes are active , the positive region can be seen in both the axis due to symmetry present in the fm state , as depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : depict_5 ] ) . from the perspective of entanglement",
    ", this partition is unique . in this scenario , there are three ways to choose the players .",
    "we find that with and without participation of spectator modes , entanglement of photon subtraction always higher or equal to that of the photon addition which makes this situation exclusive from others .",
    "upto now , we have considered an fmsv state as input and have compared the behavior of entanglement between photon - added and -subtracted states as well as entanglement of an output state in different bipartitions having different player and spectator modes . in this section ,",
    "our aim is to make comparison between the output state obtained from the tmsv state after adding or subtracting photons and the two mode state obtained from the fmsv state . to perform such comparison ,",
    "we discard two modes from the four - mode state and calculate the ln of the two mode reduced state , which we then compare with the ln of the photon - added ( subtracted ) state that is obtained from the tmsv state as the input @xcite . in case of the tm state , the output state , after adding ( subtracting ) photons , still remains pure and hence ln can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "however , for the fm case , the output state is mixed which is obtained by discarding two modes and we adopt the same mechanism as we have done to calculate von neumann entropy of reduced density matrices , described in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec:2partybipartition ] .",
    "in particular , we evaluate ln as well as trace for large @xmath188 , and then by increasing @xmath9 , we check whether trace goes to unity upto six decimal points .",
    "we truncate the system when trace has already converged to unity , upto six decimal points .    in the tmsv case",
    ", photons can be added to either of the modes or to both the modes . on the other hand , there are several scenarios for the four - mode states . if there is a single player , either one of the mode of the output state can act as player or none of the modes of the output state is the player . in case of two players , @xmath189 two players can be the two modes of the output state , @xmath190 one mode of the output state can be a player , or @xmath191 the discarded modes can be the player modes .    before considering the fmsv state ,",
    "let us first consider the tmsv state as input .",
    "note that the nature of ln qualitatively matches with the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix .",
    "as shown in @xcite , when single mode acts as player , the ln for photon addition coincide with the subtraction , which is also the case for the von neumann entropy . if both the modes act as players , photon addition is always beneficial for entanglement than the photon subtraction @xcite .    .",
    "( c ) first mode is player while the second one is spectator with @xmath192    in case of a single player or two players in the fm state , if the output state contains the player mode(s ) , then the reduced two - mode state obtained from the photon - added state has higher ln than that of the photon - subtracted state .",
    "hence , the behavior of ln of the output state from tm and fm state are identical .",
    "as we have shown , this is not the case if we consider the behavior of entanglement of pure four - mode output state in bipartitions .",
    "[ fig : log_neg_12_m_1 ] depicts the behavior of ln of the two - mode reduced state from the four - mode output state when the first mode acts as player as well as both the modes of the two mode state are players . in all these situations ,",

    "we observe that when there is a single player e.g. , the first mode of the reduced state , entanglement increases ( decreases ) monotonically , if photons are added ( subtracted ) .",
    "however , such monotonicity with respect to the number of photons added ( subtracted ) is lost if photons are added ( subtracted ) in both the modes with total number of photons being fixed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : log_neg_12_m_1](b ) . a similar qualitative feature in entanglement",
    "is seen when the first mode acts as player while second mode is a spectator having fixed finite number of photons ( see fig . [",
    "fig : log_neg_12_m_1](c ) ) .",
    "we find that the bipartite entanglement reaches its maximum with respect to @xmath84 , when equal number of photons are added ( subtracted ) in both the modes i.e. @xmath193 , in fig [ fig : log_neg_12_m_1](b ) and @xmath194 in fig .",
    "[ fig : log_neg_12_m_1](c ) .",
    "lastly , we consider the scenario , when we add and subtract photons in the discarded modes i.e. , in the third and fourth modes , and we find ln between the first and the second modes , which are spectators .",
    "ln of the output state decreases if one of the discarded modes act as a player .",
    "for example , by taking third mode as player , we plot ln of the first and the second mode with @xmath151 in fig .",
    "[ fig : log_neg_12_m_3](a ) . unlike previous cases ,",
    "ln of the photon - subtracted state is higher than that of the added state when @xmath195 which can never be observed for the tm case .",

    "we also notice that if among four modes , photons are added only in two modes , then behavior of @xmath63 obtained in the fm state and the tm state are qualitatively similar .",
    "it is clear from the behavior of the non - gaussianity measure that photon - subtracted state become slowly non - gaussian as compared to the photon - added state and the behavior remains unchanged irrespective of the choices of the player and the spectator modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : non_g_m1_m2 ] ) .",
    "the rich picture of the role of different modes , captured by entanglement , is not seen by the non - gaussianity measure and hence indicates that there is possibly no direct connection between non - gaussianity and entanglement content of the output state obtained after photon addition ( subtraction ) @xcite .",
    "photon addition and subtraction constitute useful methods to prepare non - gaussian states .",
    "it has already been established that non - gaussian states are useful in various quantum mechanical tasks ranging from entanglement distillation to quantum error correction .",
    "we have investigated the entanglement properties of the non - gaussian states generated by adding or subtracting photons in gaussian states . in case of two mode states , entanglement of photon - added states",
    "are known to be equal or higher than that of the photon - subtracted ones .",
    "we have shown that this is not the case when one increases the number of modes .",
    "we found that for four - mode states , the trend of entanglement distribution in different bipartitions of the photon - added ( -subtracted ) states is much richer than that in the two - mode states .",
    "specifically , we showed that there exists a scenario , in which multimode entanglement content of the photon - subtracted state is always higher than that of the corresponding photon - added one .",
    "the results remained unchanged even if one discarded two modes from the four - mode output state .",
    "moreover , we showed that the picture that emerges from entanglement of the output state does not match with the behavior in the same states of distance - based non - gaussianity measures .",
