    "the spatially flat , isotropic model was recently investigated in detail in the setting of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "( for a brief summary of results , see @xcite . )",
    "that investigation introduced a conceptual framework and analytical and numerical tools to construct the _ physical sector _ of the quantum theory .",
    "these methods enabled one to systematically explore the effects of quantum geometry both on the gravitational and matter sectors and to extend the previous results in lqc .",
    "if the only matter source is a massless scalar field , _ every _ classical solution has a singularity which , furthermore , persists in the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "therefore , to bring out effects which can be unambiguously attributed to the quantum nature of geometry underlying lqc , this model was analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the analysis led to the following results : i ) the scalar field was shown to serve as an internal clock , thereby providing a detailed realization of the ` emergent time ' idea ; ii ) the physical hilbert space , dirac observables and semi - classical states were constructed rigorously ; and , iii ) the hamiltonian constraint was solved numerically to show that in the backward evolution of states which are semi - classical at late times , _ the big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce_. furthermore , thanks to the non - perturbative , background independent methods , unlike in other approaches the quantum evolution is _ deterministic across the deep planck regime_.    these results are attractive and add to the growing evidence @xcite suggesting that the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) hold a key to many long standing questions .",
    "control over the physical sector of the theory and availability of numerical methods also enabled to us to analyze the physics of the bounce in greater detail than could be done in previous investigations .",
    "these details enriched our understanding of both the semi - classical and deep planck regimes .",
    "however , they also brought out a serious limitation of the framework : the critical value @xmath0 of the matter density at which the bounce occurs can be made _ arbitrarily small _ by increasing the momentum @xmath1 of the scalar field ( which is a constant of motion ) .",
    "now , large values of @xmath1 are permissible and even preferred for semi - classical considerations at late times .",
    "since it is physically unreasonable to expect quantum corrections to significantly modify classical predictions at low matter densities , this limitation is a serious drawback .",
    "indications of such problems had appeared also in some of the earlier results based on effective equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the approximations inherent to effective equations break down in the deep planck regime , one did not have an a priori reason to believe that these were consequences of the underlying _ quantum _ equations of lqc , rather than artifacts of approximation schemes .",
    "the analysis of @xcite unambiguously showed that the problem lies with the quantum equations themselves .",
    "thus , while the quantum evolution predicted by the existing lqc constraint operator has a number of attractive features , it has one major weakness . a key question then is whether one can change the definition of the constraint operator in a subtle way so that this problem is overcome , but the attractive features of the evolution are all preserved .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to justify this assertion by providing the detailed construction of the new hamiltonian constraint and analyzing the resulting quantum dynamics .",
    "we will find that the required change is in fact physically well motivated and conceptually quite compelling .",
    "the main ideas can be summarized as follows .",
    "recall that , to obtain the expression of the quantum constraint , one has to first introduce an operator representing curvature of the gravitational connection .",
    "now , a key feature of lqc inherited directly from full loop quantum gravity ( lqg) is that while there are well defined quantum analogs of holonomies , there is no operator corresponding to the connection itself @xcite .",
    "thus , one is naturally led to define the curvature operator in terms of holonomies . in the classical theory ,",
    "curvature can be expressed as a limit of the holonomies around a loop as the area enclosed by the loop shrinks to zero . in quantum geometry , however , one can not continuously shrink the loop to zero area ; there is a smallest non - zero area eigenvalue , or an ` area gap ' @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the physical idea then is to incorporate the existence of the mass gap @xmath2 @xcite in the limiting procedure .",
    "however , in the existing definition of the quantum constraint , this physical idea was mathematically implemented in a rather indirect manner .",
    "initially , it was meant to be only a first step to gain a qualitative understanding of dynamics within lqc .",
    "nonetheless , as more and more physically appealing features of this dynamics were discovered , the constraint operator obtained by this procedure was taken more and more seriously and constituted the basis of a number of approximation schemes and effective descriptions .    the new hamiltonian constraint introduced in this paper",
    "is based on the same principles but the curvature operator is now constructed by a more direct implementation of the underlying physical ideas .",
    "the structure of the final constraint operator does change significantly but , when suitably recast , its form is actually somewhat simpler .",
    "furthermore , it has additional conceptually attractive features .",
    "for example , its wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) limit naturally comes with the ` covariant factor ordering ' of that theory .",
    "once the new constraint is introduced , we apply analytical and numerical methods of @xcite to extract physical predictions from the theory .",
    "specifically , we will build the physical hilbert space @xmath3 from solutions to the new quantum constraint , introduce on it a complete family of dirac observables , construct suitable families of states which are semi - classical at ` late times ' ( e.g. , ` now ' ) , and numerically evolve them back in time .",
    "as in @xcite , we will find that in this backward evolution , the big bang is again replaced by the quantum bounce .",
    "qualitative features of the evolution are very similar to those observed in @xcite , _ except that the big bounce occurs precisely when the matter density enters the planck regime , _ irrespective of the value of @xmath1 and other initial conditions .",
    "to summarize , the hamiltonian constraint will be improved by implementing the physical idea of @xcite in a more satisfactory manner .",
    "the resulting dynamics will retain the attractive features of the older quantum evolution but free it from its main drawback .",
    "this rather delicate interplay between physics and mathematics is both interesting and instructive .",
    "we wish to emphasize however that the present procedure still retains a basic limitation of the existing treatments : the hamiltonian constraint is not systematically derived from the full theory .",
    "indeed , this important task can not yet be undertaken because there is no unambiguous hamiltonian constraint in the full theory which can serve as the natural starting point for a systematic reduction .",
    "the organization of this paper parallels that of @xcite and we use the same notation .",
    "_ we direct the reader to that paper for motivations as well as further technical details . _ in section [ s2 ] we introduce the new hamiltonian constraint operator . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we discuss the theory that results when one ignores the effects of quantum geometry . as in @xcite , we find that the singularity is not resolved in that limit . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we return to lqc and construct the physical sector of the theory .",
    "quantum states which are semi - classical at ` late times ' are then numerically evolved backwards in section [ s5 ] .",
    "we find that the classical big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce which occurs when the matter is compressed enough to acquire a density of the planck scale .",
    "thus , in the deep planck regime , quantum geometry has the effect of making gravity strongly repulsive .",
    "a key virtue of the new constraint operator is that these effects are completely negligible when the matter density is significantly smaller than the planck density .",
    "section [ s6 ] summarizes the main results and briefly discusses possible extensions .",
    "while our detailed analysis is restricted to a specific and rather simple model , the key ideas behind the construction of the new constraint operator can be applied much more generally .",
    "this is illustrated in appendix [ a1 ] where we allow for the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "( other models will be discussed also by other authors in forthcoming papers . )",
    "appendix [ a2 ] discusses conceptual issues that are especially relevant to approximation schemes used in constructing effective equations .",
    "a brief overview of lqg emphasizing these developments in lqc can be found in @xcite .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first two we introduce the key new elements and in the third we put them together to construct the new hamiltonian constraint operator .",
    "let us first collect the required background material and notation .",
    "( for details , see @xcite . ) in a systematic hamiltonian treatment of spatially flat , isotropic models , one has to first introduce an elementary cell @xmath4 and restricts all integrations to this cell . fix a fiducial flat metric @xmath5 and denote by @xmath6 the volume of the elementary cell @xmath4 in this geometry .",
    "the gravitational phase space variables the connections @xmath7 and the density weighted triads @xmath8 can be expressed as : a_a^i = cv_o^-13 _ a^i , e^a_i = p v_o^-23 ^a_i where @xmath9 are a set of orthonormal co - triads and triads compatible with @xmath5 and adapted to the edges of the elementary cell @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the symmetry reduced gravitational phase space is only 2-dimensional , coordinatized by the pair @xmath10 . thanks to the availability of the fiducial cell @xmath4 , the coordinates @xmath11",
    "are insensitive to the choice of the fiducial metric , i.e. , remain unchanged under the rescaling @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental poisson bracket is given by : \\{c , p } = 8g3 where @xmath13 is the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint can be written as : c _ = - ^-2 _ v d^3 x _ ijk e^-1 e^aie^bj f_ab^k = -6 ^ 2 c^2 where @xmath14 .",
    "in quantum theory , following dirac , one first constructs a kinematical description .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath15 is the space @xmath16 of square integrable functions on the bohr compactification of the real line . to specify states concretely , it is convenient to work with the representation in which the operator @xmath17 is diagonal .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath17 are labelled by a real number @xmath18 and satisfy the orthonormality relation : _",
    "1|_2 = _ _ 1 , _ 2 .",
    "since the right side is the kronecker delta rather than the dirac delta distribution , a typical state in @xmath15 can be expressed as a countable sum ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 are complex coefficients and the inner product is given by _ 1| _ 2 = _",

    "let us allow for this possibility and fix the appropriate @xmath24 at the end .    for the field strength @xmath41 , we use the standard strategy employed in gauge theories .",
    "consider a square @xmath42 in the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane spanned by a face of the elementary cell , each of whose sides has length @xmath45 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath5 . then",
    ", ` the @xmath46 component ' of the curvature is given by : [ f ] f_ab^k = -2_ar _ 0 ( h^()__ij-1 ^2v_o^2/3 ) ^k ^i_a ^j_b .",
    "here @xmath47 is the area of the square under consideration , and the holonomy @xmath48 around the square @xmath42 is just the product of holonomies ( [ hol ] ) along the four edges of @xmath42 : h^()__ij = h_i^ ( ) h_j^ ( ) ( h_i^())^-1 ( h_j^())^-1 . combining eqs .

    "since the constraint is now expressed in terms of elementary variables which have unambiguous quantum analogs , it is straightforward to write down the quantum operator @xmath50 .",
    "however , the limit @xmath51 of this operator does not exist .",
    "this is not accidental ; had the limit existed , there would be a well - defined local operator corresponding to the curvature @xmath41 and we know that even in full lqg , while holonomy operators are well defined , there are no local operators representing connections and curvatures . this feature is intimately intertwined with the quantum nature of riemannian geometry of lqg .",
    "the viewpoint in lqc is that the failure of the limit to exist is a reminder that there is an underlying _ quantum _ geometry where eigenvalues of the area operator are _ discrete _ , whence there is a smallest non - zero eigenvalue , @xmath2 , i.e. , an _",
    "area gap_. thus , quantum geometry is telling us that , on physical grounds , it is inappropriate to let @xmath47 go to zero ; the ` correct ' procedure must take into account the existence of the area gap .",
    "up to this stage , we have followed the standard lqc reasoning , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the difference comes in the implementation of the above idea .",
    "the viewpoint we now adopt is that since quantization of area refers to _ physical _ geometries , we should shrink the loop @xmath42 till the area enclosed by it , as measured by the physical metric @xmath52 , reaches the value @xmath2 .",
    "since the physical area of faces of the elementary cell is @xmath53 and since each side of @xmath42 is @xmath24 times the edge of the elementary cell , we are led to choose for @xmath24 a specific function @xmath54 , given by [ mbar ] ^2 |p| = ( 2 ) ^2 while @xmath55 is a non - trivial function on the phase space , its analog @xmath56 in the existing lqc treatments was required to be a constant . is an eigenstate of the area operator ( associated with the face of the elementary cell orthogonal to the @xmath40th direction ) .",
    "one fixes @xmath56 by demanding that this eigenvalue be @xmath2 and finds @xmath57 , a constant .",
    "] technically , this contrast turns out to be important . if we write the quantum constraint using the @xmath58 basis , the constraint operator of @xcite is a difference operator with _ uniform _ step size , given by @xmath59 . in this basis",
    "the action of the new quantum constraint would be again given by a difference operator , but the step size now depends on the state @xmath58 it operates on .",
    "this difference turns out to be subtle enough to remove the major weakness of the current lqc constraint operator , while retaining its physically desirable features .",
    "conceptually , the new strategy has important ramifications for the fundamental curvature operator . in both treatments , it is _ non - local_. however , while the non - local operator used in the existing literature depends only on the connection , the non - local operator introduced here depends both on the connection _ and _ the geometry . in the classical limit ,",
    "effects of quantum geometry are negligible and the classical limits of both operators yield the standard expression of the curvature @xmath60 .    finally , some heuristics involving full lqg can be used rather effectively to bring out the physical difference between the two strategies . in the sector of full lqg consisting of a small but a finite neighborhood of homogeneous isotropic cosmologies , one should be able to carry out partial gauge fixing , enabling one to speak of 3-metrics ( rather than their equivalence classes under diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "let us consider quantum geometry states based on graphs and for simplicity focus on the fixed fiducial cell .",
    "then , one would expect that , as the scale factor @xmath61 grows , the number @xmath62 of vertices in the graph contained in the fiducial cell would grow as @xmath63 for some constant @xmath64 . in the hamiltonian constraint of full lqg , the operator @xmath60 would have to be evaluated at these vertices .",
    "a natural procedure is to introduce an ` elementary cube ' around each vertex and calculate the holonomy around the faces of that cube . since the number @xmath62 of elementary cubes contained in the fiducial cell increases as @xmath61 grows , the area of their faces , _ as measured by the fixed fiducial metric _ would decrease as @xmath65",
    "hence , as measured by the fiducial metric , the length of each edge of the face around which the holonomy is evaluated would go as @xmath66  i.e. precisely as @xmath67 .",
    "thus the functional dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath18 can be thought of as the remnant left behind by the sector of the full theory of interest to cosmology , on the mini - superspace considered in this paper .",
    "fixing the edge length to be @xmath56 , i.e. , making it state independent , amounts to ignoring the ` creation of new vertices ' that one expects to accompany the expansion of the universe .",
    "these considerations complement ideas recently advocated by bojowald to incorporate inhomogeneities in lqc @xcite .      having fixed @xmath24 to be the specific function @xmath54 ,",
    "we are now led to write the expression of the quantum constraint by replacing @xmath24 in the right side of ( [ hc1 ] ) by @xmath55 , the holonomies and the volume functions by corresponding operators , and the poisson bracket by @xmath69 times the commutator . however , to carry out this task , we first need to define the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i.e. the operator @xmath72 .",
    "this task is a somewhat subtle because i ) there is no operator corresponding to @xmath36 and hence to @xmath73 , and , ii ) since @xmath55 is a function of @xmath37 , @xmath74 can not be expressed as a function of the ` elementary variables ' @xmath37 and @xmath75 where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "however , in this task we are aided by geometric considerations .",
    "let us begin with states @xmath76 in the schrdinger hilbert space , @xmath77 .",
    "for any real constant @xmath40 we have : [ holop ] ( ) = ( + k ) e^k ( ) .",
    "thus , the action of the operator is to drag the state along the vector field @xmath78 .",
    "now , the 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms generated by the vector field @xmath79 has a well - defined action also on the hilbert space @xmath15 now under consideration .",
    "therefore , eq ( [ holop ] ) holds also for states @xmath76 in @xmath15 provided @xmath80 is interpreted simply as the operator that drags the state a unit affine parameter distance along the vector field @xmath81 .",
    "this suggests that it is natural to set ( ) = e^ ( ) so the right side would be the image of @xmath82 under the finite diffeomorphism obtained by moving a unit affine parameter distance along the integral curve of the vector field @xmath83 .",
    "the affine parameter @xmath84 along this vector field is given by : [ v ] v = k sgn ( ) ||^32 , k = 23 although the geometrical meaning of this action of @xmath85 is simple , since @xmath84 is a rather complicated function of @xmath18 , its expression in the @xmath18-representation is complicated : [ mbop1 ] ( ) = ( sgn ( ) ^23),= sgn ( ) ||^32 + 1k however , it is well - defined because @xmath86 is an invertible ( and @xmath87 ) function of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath88 , the action reduces to the form ( ) ( + ) familiar from the ` standard ' lqg analysis where @xmath55 is replaced by a constant @xmath56 ( see eq ( [ holop ] ) ) .",
    "however , as is clear from the exact expression ( [ mbop1 ] ) , this form with a ` simple displacement ' of the argument is highly inaccurate for small @xmath18 .",
    "the complicated action of @xmath68 just reflects the fact that the variable @xmath18 determined by eigenvalues of @xmath17 is not well - adapted to the vector field @xmath89 .",
    "let us therefore change the basis @xmath58 to @xmath90 .",
    "this basis is more directly adapted to the volume operator @xmath91 ( associated with the elementary cell @xmath4 ) : [ vv ] @xmath92 = ( 86)^32 |v|k^3 @xmath92 ( it follows from ( [ v ] ) that , like @xmath18 , @xmath84 is dimensionless . )",
    "these kets also constitute an orthonormal basis in @xmath15 : @xmath93 .",
    "the two bases are of course closely related because @xmath91 and @xmath17 are just functions of one another . in terms of representations",
    ", we can simply set @xmath94 . in the @xmath84-representation ,",
    "the action of @xmath68 is extremely simple : [ mbop2 ] ( v ) = ( v+1 ) therefore , in what follows we will use the @xmath84 representation .",
    "many of the expressions obtained using the new constraint will then have a form rather similar to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "but it is important to keep in mind that while those expressions were written in the @xmath18 representation , the ones in this paper are written in the @xmath84-representation .",
    "this difference is a key reason why the present hamiltonian constraint is free of the drawback of the one used in the literature so far .",
    "note that the operator @xmath68 is unitary .",
    "we can extend the definition in the obvious manner : by setting ( v ) = ( v+k ) for any constant @xmath40 , we obtain a unitary representation on @xmath15 of the 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the vector field @xmath89 . on the classical phase space ,",
    "the function @xmath95 generates a 1-parameter family of ( finite ) canonical transformations .",
    "it is precisely the lift to the phase space of the 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms on the @xmath37 or @xmath18 space , generated by the vector field @xmath96 .",
    "the action of @xmath68 simply promotes this relation to the quantum theory .",
    "* remark : * while the geometric interpretation of the action of @xmath68 makes its definition quite natural , one might nonetheless ask for the relation between our factor ordering and that normally used . we will now argue that the choice we have specified in fact originates in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "consider 1-d schrdinger quantum mechanics , where states @xmath97 are generally taken to be functions in @xmath98 .",
    "consider a function @xmath99 on the classical phase space .",
    "the canonical transformation it generates is again the lift to the phase space of the diffeomorphism generated by the vector field @xmath100 on the configuration space ( i.e. , the x - axis ) .",
    "one would expect that this geometric action would be carried over also to quantum theory .",
    "is this in fact the case ? in the textbook treatments one does not take into account such geometric considerations but constructs a self - adjoint operator @xmath101 using a symmetric ordering .",
    "its action @xmath102 does _ not _ correspond to the lie - derivative of @xmath82 with respect to the vector field @xmath89 , which is captured just in the first term .",
    "( the second term , @xmath103 , multiplies @xmath82 by the divergence of the vector field @xmath89 , i.e. , by the lie - derivative of the lebesgue measure with respect to @xmath89 . ) hence , the action of the 1-parameter group of unitary transformations @xmath104 on wave functions @xmath97 is _ different _ from that of the diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath89 .",
    "however , this is simply because the lebesgue measure @xmath105 fails to be invariant under the diffeomorphism .",
    "let us represent quantum states by densities @xmath106 of weight 1/2 or , more precisely , half - forms so that the scalar product is given simply by @xmath107 without the need of a measure .",
    "( thus , @xmath108 . for details ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . ) on these half forms , the action of @xmath109 is _ precisely _ that of a lie derivative ; @xmath110",
    ". therefore , the action of the unitary transformation @xmath111 is given by : @xmath112 where @xmath84 is the affine parameter of the vector field @xmath89 on @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the initial geometric expectation is indeed realized if one proceeds with the standard factor ordering from schrdinger quantum mechanics , but represents states by half forms . in the polymer representation",
    "the measure is invariant under the action of any diffeomorphism on the @xmath18-axis .",
    "hence the additional ` divergence term ' is unnecessary . in this sense ,",
    "states in @xmath15 are analogs of densities of weight 1/2 or , half forms in the schrdinger representation .",
    "we can now collect the results of the last two sub - sections to obtain the quantum constraint operator starting from the classical expression ( [ hc1 ] ) .",
    "we have : [ a ] c_&= & ( c ) ( c ) + & = : & ( c ) a ( c ) where , for clarity of visualization , we have suppressed hats over the operators @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "let us focus on the operator @xmath116 first .",
    "some care is needed in its evaluation because , while all other operators in this expression are densely defined , @xmath117 is unambiguously defined only on those states @xmath118 whose support excludes the point @xmath119 .",
    "however , a straightforward calculation shows that 24 i8 ^3 ^3 ^2 & & ( v - v ) ( v ) + & = & - 27k4 ^3/2 |v| ( v )  .",
    "( the expression in round brackets ( containing the trignometric functions and @xmath91 ) is already diagonal in the @xmath90 basis .",
    "hence there is no factor ordering problem between this part of the operator and the pre - factor involving @xmath120 . ) since the right hand side vanishes at @xmath119 , it is in the domain of @xmath117 , whence @xmath116 is well defined and given by a ( v ) = - 27k4 ^3/2 |v| | |v - 1| - |v + 1| | ( v )  .",
    "thus , @xmath90 is an eigenket of @xmath116 .",
    "since the eigenvalues of @xmath116 are real and negative , it is a negative definite self - adjoint operator on @xmath15 .",
    "the form of @xmath121 in ( [ a ] ) immediately implies that it is also self - adjoint and negative definite on @xmath15 .",
    "its action is given by : [ hc2]c _ ( v ) = f_+(v ) ( v + 4 ) + f_o(v ) ( v ) + f_-(v ) ( v - 4 ) with f_+(v ) & = & 2716 k^3/2    f_-(v ) & = & f_+(v - 4 ) + f_o(v ) & = & - f_+(v ) -",
    "f_-(v )  .",
    "thus , the new gravitational constraint is again a difference operator .",
    "however , whereas the operator used so far in the literature involves steps which are constant ( @xmath59 ) in magnitude in the eigenvalues of @xmath17 , the new constraint involves steps which are constant in eigenvalues of the _ volume _ operator @xmath91 . in the @xmath58 basis these steps vary , becoming smaller for large @xmath18 .",
    "note also that although @xmath55 diverges at @xmath119 , individual operators entering the constraint and hence the full constraint operator itself are well - defined on the state @xmath122 .",
    "finally , to write the complete constraint operator we also need the matter part of the constraint . for the massless scalar field , in the classical theory",
    "it is given by : c_matt = 8 g |p|^-32 p_^2 thus , as usual , the non - trivial part in the passage to quantum theory is the function @xmath123 .",
    "however , as with the co - triad operator ( [ cotriad ] ) , this can be used by the method introduced by thiemann in the full theory @xcite . in this quantization",
    ", there are two ambiguities @xcite , labelled by an half integer @xmath44 and a real number @xmath124 in the range @xmath125 . as in @xcite ,",
    "following the general considerations in @xcite , we will set @xmath126 .",
    "for @xmath124 , a general selection criterion is not available and values @xmath127 and @xmath128 have been used varyingly in the literature .",
    "qualitative features of our results do not depend on this choice .",
    "since @xmath127 makes expressions simpler and since we used @xmath129 in @xcite , for simplicity and variety we will set @xmath130 in this paper .",
    "then , the point of departure is the identity |p|^-12 = ( p ) on the classical phase space . in the lqc literature ,",
    "this identity is generally used with a constant @xmath56 in place of @xmath55 . however , since volume depends only on @xmath37 , in the poisson bracket only the derivative with respect to @xmath36 of the holonomy appears .",
    "therefore , the identity continues to hold although @xmath55 is a function of @xmath18 .. we will refrain from doing so because the function @xmath55 was already determined for us in the gravitational part of the hamiltonian and choosing another function in an ad - hoc manner for the matter part would make the operator less natural . ]    again in the passage to quantum theory , some care is needed because of the presence of @xmath131 on the right side .",
    "however , again the image of the operator defined by the expression in the square brackets is in the domain of @xmath131 , whence the total operator on the right side is densely defined : ( v ) = 32(68 ^2)^1/2 k^1/3 |v|^1/3 | |v + 1|^1/3 - |v - 1|^1/3 | ( v ) for @xmath132 , the eigenvalue is given by @xmath133 , whence the classical behavior is recovered .",
    "however , the operator is well - behaved on the ket @xmath122 ; in fact , as is usual in lqc it is an eigenvector and the eigenvalue vanishes .",
    "since @xmath134 is a well - defined , self - adjoint operator , we can take its cube to obtain the action of @xmath135 .",
    "it is diagonal in the @xmath84 representation , with action : [ inversevol ] ( v ) = ( 68 ^2)^3/2 b(v ) ( v ) where [ b ] b(v ) = ( 32)^3 k |v| | |v + 1|^1/3 - |v - 1|^1/3 |^3    collecting these results we can express the total constraint ( v ) = ( _ grav + _ matt ) ( v ) = 0 , as follows : [ hc3 ] ^2_(v , ) & = & ^-1 ( c^+(v ) ( v+4 , ) + c^o(v ) ( v , ) + c^-(v ) ( v-4 , ) ) + & = : & - ( v , )   where the coefficients @xmath136 and @xmath137 are given by : [ c ] c^+(v ) & = & 3k g8 |v + 2| | |v + 1| - |v + 3| | + c^-(v ) & = & c^+(v - 4 ) + c^o(v ) & = & - c^+(v ) - c^-(v )  .",
    "this is the hamiltonian constraint we will work with in the remainder of the paper .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the form of this constraint is similar to that of a massless klein - gordon field in a static space - time , with @xmath138 playing the role of time and the difference operator @xmath139 of the spatial laplace - type operator .",
    "hence , the scalar field @xmath138 can again be used as ` emergent time ' in the quantum theory .",
    "we will examine the operator @xmath139 in some detail in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .",
    "finally , in the above construction we made a factor ordering choice , the most significant of which is to write the gravitational part of the constraint as @xmath140 by splitting the @xmath141 term @xcite ( see ( [ hc1 ] ) and ( [ a ] ) ) .",
    "since @xmath116 is self - adjoint and negative definite ( and @xmath142 is self - adjoint ) , this ordering directly endows the same properties on the gravitational constraint @xmath121 .",
    "however , there are other possibilities which may well be better suited in more complicated models . for the model under consideration",
    ", we considered one other natural candidate in @xcite and found that the main results were not affected by the change .",
    "therefore we did not use other factor orderings in the numerical simulations with the new constraint .",
    "in this section we will discuss the limit of lqc in which effects specific to quantum geometry in the difference equation ( [ hc3 ] ) are ignored .",
    "although this limiting theory is straightforward , we present it in some detail because it provides a simpler and more familiar setting for constructing the physical hilbert space , dirac observables and semi - classical states and because this discussion will enable us to compare and contrast the theory with lqc in detail .",
    "the section is divided into two parts . in the first we obtain the limit of ( [ hc3 ] ) and its general solution . in the second we construct the physical sector of the theory , using the scalar field @xmath138 as emergent time and",
    "show that the big bang singularity is not resolved in the limit .      to obtain the limit of ( [ hc3 ] ) we will follow the same procedure that we used in @xcite . in particular , since the geometrodynamical description is insensitive to the choice of triad orientation i.e .",
    ", to the sign of @xmath84 we will restrict ourselves to wave functions @xmath143 which are symmetric under @xmath144 . as in @xcite",
    ", the analogs of the lqc quantities will be written with an underbar .",
    "let us begin by setting : [ chi ] ( v ) : = ( |v| | |v-1|-|v+1| | ) ( ( v+2 ) - ( v-2 ) ) , so that the gravitational part ( [ hc2 ] ) of the hamiltonian constraint can be written as _",
    "grav^ ( v ) = 27k16 [ ( v+2 ) -(v-2 ) ] .to obtain the limit , let us assume @xmath145 and @xmath143 is smooth . then , we have :",
    "_ grav^ ( v ) = 54 k v ( |v| ( v)v ) + o(v^n-3^nv^n ) where @xmath146 .",
    "thus , if we restrict ourselves to wave functions @xmath106 which are slowly varying in the sense that the second term on the right hand side is negligible compared to the first , we obtain the limit of the gravitational part of the constraint : [ wdw1 ] _",
    "grav^wdw ( v ) = 54 k v ( |v| ( v)v).this approximation is not uniform because the terms which are neglected depend on @xmath106 .",
    "we will show at the end that these assumptions are realized in a self - consistent manner on semi - classical states of interest .",
    "for now we only note that @xmath147 is self - adjoint and negative definite on the kinematic hilbert space @xmath148 of the theory .    finally , recall that the full constraint is given by = _",
    "grav + 8 g ( 68 ^ 2)^3/2 b(v ) _",
    "^2 where the function @xmath149 is defined in ( [ b ] ) .",
    "this function is well - approximated by @xmath150 for @xmath145 .",

    "its conjugate variable @xmath154 change signs under this transformation . in the present model",
    ", this corresponds to the symplectomorphism @xmath155 which is then naturally lifted to an automorphism of the quantum algebra .",
    "the mapping @xmath152 is the induced action of this automorphism on states . ]",
    "hence it preserves the space of wave functions under consideration , namely the eigenspace of @xmath152 with eigenvalue @xmath156 .    note that if , as is in geometrodynamics , we were to represent quantum states as functions @xmath157 , the operator @xmath151 would have the action : @xmath158 . now , in geometrodynamics , the classical constraint has the form @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the dewitt metric on the 2-dimensional configuration space spanned by the pair @xmath161 . in quantum theory ,",
    "the natural choice of factor ordering is to use the laplace - beltrami operator of @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "then , the equation has the form : @xmath162 @xcite , which is precisely our equation ( [ wdw2 ] ) .",
    "thus the limit of the current , ` improved ' hamiltonian constraint , automatically yields the ` natural ' factor ordering of the theory .",
    "this provides an indirect support for the factor ordering in lqc that led us to ( [ hc3 ] ) .",
    "since the form of the limit is symmetric in @xmath138 and @xmath84 we could use either the volume of the universe or the scalar field as the ` emergent time ' and the other variable as the true dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , in the ( k=1 ) closed model , @xmath138 is better suited as the time variable .",
    "more importantly , the form of the lqc constraint ( [ hc3 ] ) is such that it would be technically difficult to regard @xmath84 as time beyond the limit",
    ". therefore , we will regard @xmath138 as time so that the dynamics is described by the evolution of the volume of the universe with respect to this emergent time , @xmath138 . as emphasized in @xcite , it is _ not _ essential to make a specific choice of an ` emergent time ' ; one can construct the physical sector of the theory without making a choice .",
    "however , choosing @xmath138 as time provides a heuristic understanding of the intermediate stages of the procedure and lets us interpret the final results in the language of the more familiar notion of ` evolution ' rather than in terms of a ` frozen formalism ' .",
    "the form of the equation ( [ wdw2 ] ) is very simple ; if we set @xmath163 , the constraint assumes the form of a massless klein gordon equation in the flat space spanned by @xmath164 and @xmath138 . however , to bring out similarities and contrasts between this theory and the lqc description presented in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ]",
    ", we will use the same steps as the ones used there .",
    "let us first note that the operator @xmath151 is positive definite and self - adjoint on the hilbert space @xmath165 where the subscript @xmath166 denotes the restriction to the symmetric eigenspace of @xmath152 .",
    "its eigenfunctions @xmath167 with eigenvalue @xmath168 are 2-fold degenerate on this hilbert space .",
    "therefore , they can be labelled by a real number @xmath40 : [ ek_eq ] _",
    "k(v ) : = 1 e^ik|v|where @xmath40 is related to @xmath169 via @xmath170 .",
    "on @xmath171 , they form an orthonormal basis : @xmath172 . a general solution to ( [ wdw2 ] ) with initial data in the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions",
    "can be written as [ sol1 ] ( v , ) = _ -^ k _ + ( k ) _",
    "k(v ) e^i+ _ -(k )    space . following the terminology generally used in the klein - gordon theory ,",
    "the solution will be said to be ` incoming ' ( ` contracting ' ) if @xmath173 have support only on the positive half of the @xmath40 axis and ` outgoing ' or ( ` expanding ' ) if they have support only on the negative half of the @xmath40 axis .",
    "if @xmath174 vanishes , the solution will be said to be of positive frequency and if @xmath175 vanishes it will be said to be of negative frequency .    as usual ,",
    "the positive and negative frequency solutions satisfy first order ` evolution ' equations , obtained by taking a square - root of the constraint ( [ wdw2 ] ) : [ freq1]i _ ( v , ) = ( v , ) .",
    "if @xmath176 is the initial data for these equations at ` time @xmath177 ' , the solutions are given by : [ sol2 ] _",
    "( v , ) = e^i ( -_o ) f(v )      solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) to the equation are not normalizable in @xmath178 ( because zero is in the continuous part of the spectrum of the operator ) .",
    "our first task is to endow the space of these physical states with a hilbert space structure .",
    "there are several possible avenues . as in @xcite",
    ", we will begin with one that is somewhat heuristic but has direct physical motivation .",
    "the idea @xcite is to introduce operators corresponding to a complete set of dirac observables and select the required inner product by demanding that they be self - adjoint . in the classical theory ,",
    "since @xmath1 is a constant of motion , it is a dirac observable .",
    "while @xmath84 is not a constant of motion , on each dynamical trajectory @xmath179 is a monotonic function of @xmath138 , whence @xmath180 is a dirac observable for any fixed @xmath181 .",
    "these form a complete set and it is straightforward to write the corresponding quantum operators .",
    "however , because we are interested only in states @xmath182 which are symmetric under @xmath183 , it suffices to consider @xmath184 in place of @xmath185 .",
    "now , since @xmath186 commutes with the operator in ( [ wdw2 ] ) , given a ( symmetric ) solution @xmath187 to ( [ wdw2 ] ) , [ dirac1 ] _ ( v , ) : = -i is again a ( symmetric ) solution .",
    "so , we can just retain this definition of @xmath186 from @xmath178 .",
    "the schrdinger type evolutions ( [ sol2 ] ) enable us to define the other dirac observable @xmath188 : given a ( symmetric ) solution @xmath187 to ( [ wdw2 ] ) , we can first decompose it into positive and negative frequency parts @xmath189 , freeze them at @xmath177 , multiply this ` initial datum ' by @xmath190 and evolve via ( [ sol2 ] ) : [ dirac2 ] ||__o(v , ) = e^i(-_o )    solution to the equation ( [ wdw2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , both these operators preserve the positive and negative frequency subspaces .",
    "since they constitute a complete family of dirac observables , we have _ superselection_. in quantum theory we can restrict ourselves to one superselected sector . in",
    "what follows , for definiteness _ we will focus on the positive frequency sector and , from now on , drop the suffix @xmath191_.    we now seek an inner product on the space of positive frequency solutions @xmath187 to ( [ sol2 ] ) ( invariant under the @xmath84 reflection ) which makes @xmath186 and @xmath188 self - adjoint .",
    "each of these solutions is completely determined by its initial datum @xmath192 and the dirac observables have the following action on the datum : ( v , ) = |v| ( v,_o ) , _ ( v,_o ) = ( v,_o ) .",
    "therefore , it follows that ( modulo an overall rescaling , ) the unique inner product which will make these operators self - adjoint is just : [ ip1 ] _",
    "1|_2 _ phy = _",
    "= _ o dv ( v ) |_1(v , ) _ 2(v , ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that the inner product is conserved , i.e. , is independent of the choice of the ` instant ' @xmath177 .",
    "thus , _ the physical hilbert space @xmath193 is the space of positive frequency wave functions @xmath187 which are symmetric under the @xmath84 reflection and have a finite norm , defined by ( [ ip1 ] ) . _",
    "the procedure has already provided us with a representation of our complete set of dirac observables on this @xmath193 : [ dirac3]||__o ( v , ) = e^i(-_o ) |v| ( v,_o ) , _",
    "( v , ) = ( v , ) .",
    "arguments of @xcite can be repeated to show that the same representation of the algebra of dirac observables can be obtained by the group averaging method @xcite which is mathematically more stream - lined .",
    "finally , using the physical hilbert space and this complete set of dirac observables we can now introduce semi - classical states and study their evolution .",
    "let us fix an ` instant of time ' @xmath177 and construct a semi - classical state which is peaked at @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "since we would like the peak to be at a point that represents a large classical universe , we are led to choose @xmath196 and ( in the natural classical units @xmath36=@xmath197=1 ) @xmath198 . in the closed ( @xmath199 ) models for example , the second condition is necessary to ensure that the universe expands out to a size much larger than the planck scale . at ` time ' @xmath177 , consider the state [ sc ] ( v,_o ) = _ -^dk ( k ) _",
    "k(v ) e^i(_o-^ ) , ( k ) = e^-(k - k^)^22 ^ 2 . here",
    "@xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "it is easy to evaluate the integral in the approximation @xmath202 which is justified because @xmath203 is sharply peaked at @xmath204 and @xmath205 and calculate mean values of the dirac observables and their fluctuations .",
    "one finds that , as required , at @xmath206 the state is sharply peaked at values @xmath207 .",
    "the above construction is closely related to that of coherent states in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the main difference is that the observables of interest are not @xmath84 and its conjugate momentum but rather @xmath84 and @xmath1 the momentum conjugate to ` time ' , i.e. , the analog of the hamiltonian in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "we can now ask for the evolution of this state .",
    "does it remain peaked at the classical trajectory defined by @xmath208 and passing through @xmath209 at @xmath206 ?",
    "this question is easy to answer because ( [ sol2 ] ) implies that the ( positive frequency ) solution to @xmath210 ( [ wdw2 ] ) defined by the initial data ( [ sc ] ) is obtained simply by replacing @xmath181 by @xmath138 in ( [ sc ] ) ! since @xmath211 , the measure of dispersion in ( [ sc ] ) , does not depend on @xmath138 , it follows that @xmath210 continues to be peaked at a trajectory = + _ o which is precisely the classical solution of interest .",
    "this is precisely what one would hope during the epoch in which the universe is large .",
    "however , the property holds also in the planck regime and , in the backward evolution , the semi - classical state simply follows the classical trajectory into the big - bang singularity .",
    "( had we worked with positive @xmath204 , we would have obtained a contracting solution and then the forward evolution would have followed the classical trajectory into the big - crunch singularity . ) in this sense , the evolution does not resolve the classical singularity .",
    "we will show in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] that the situation is very different in lqc .",
    "this can occur because the equation is a good approximation to the discrete equation only for large @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , as noted before , the approximation is not uniform but depends on the state : in arriving at the equation from lqc we had to neglect @xmath106 dependent terms of the form @xmath212 for @xmath146 . for semi - classical states considered above , this implies that the approximation is excellent for @xmath213 but becomes inadequate when the peak of the wave function lies at a value of @xmath84 comparable to @xmath204 .",
    "then , the lqc evolution departs sharply from the evolution .",
    "we will find that , rather than following the classical trajectory into the big bang singularity , the peak now exhibits a bounce . since large values of @xmath204 are classically preferred , the value of @xmath84 at the bounce can be quite large .",
    "however , as remarked in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] , we will find that the matter density at the bounce point is comparable to the planck density , independent of the value of @xmath204 .",
    "* remark : * in the above discussion for simplicity we restricted ourselves to eigenfunctions @xmath214 which are symmetric under @xmath215 from the beginning .",
    "had we dropped this requirement , we would have found that there is a 4-fold ( rather than 2-fold ) degeneracy in the eigenfunctions of @xmath216 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath217 is the step function ( @xmath218 if @xmath219 and @xmath220 if @xmath221 ) , then @xmath222 are all continuous functions of @xmath84 which satisfy the eigenvalue equation ( in the distributional sense ) with eigenvalue @xmath223 .",
    "this fact will be relevant in the next section .",
    "we will now analyze the model using lqc .",
    "since the form of the lqc ` evolution equation ' is very similar to that of the theory , we will be able to construct the physical hilbert space and dirac observables following the ideas introduced in section [ s3.2 ] .",

    "the form of the constraint now suggests that it is natural to regard @xmath138 as emergent time . to implement this idea ,",
    "let us introduce an appropriate kinematical hilbert space for both geometry and the scalar field : @xmath226 . since @xmath138 is to be thought of as ` time ' and @xmath84 as the genuine , physical degree of freedom which evolves with respect to this ` time '",
    ", we chose the standard schrdinger representation for @xmath138 but the ` polymer representation ' for @xmath84 to correctly incorporate the quantum geometry effects .",
    "this is a conservative approach in that the results will directly reveal the manifestations of quantum geometry .",
    "had we chosen a non - standard representation for the scalar field , these effects would have been mixed with those arising from an unusual representation of ` time evolution ' and , furthermore , comparison with the theory would have become more complicated .",
    "( however , the use of a ` polymer representation ' for @xmath138 may become necessary to treat inhomogeneities in an adequate fashion . )    the form of ( [ hc3 ] ) is the same as that of the constraint ( [ wdw2 ] ) and @xmath139 is again a positive self - adjoint operator , now on @xmath227 .",
    "the main difference is that while the @xmath151 is a differential operator , the lqc @xmath139 is a _ difference _ operator .",
    "this gives rise to certain technically important distinctions .",
    "for , now the space of physical states i.e .",
    "of appropriate solutions to the constraint equation is naturally divided into sectors each of which is preserved by the ` evolution ' and by the action of our dirac observables .",

    "_ indeed , a key strength of this work is that several features of the present simulations are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite . finally , in both works ,",
    "detailed numerical analysis of dynamics was restricted to those quantum states which are semi - classical at late times . within the model",
    ", these states best represent our physical universe and our discussion of the quantum bounce refers only to these states , although evolution is well defined and unitary on the full physical hilbert space .",
    "we deliberately followed the same organization as @xcite to bring out the ( similarities and ) differences between the two quantum evolutions .",
    "physically the differences are critically important but mathematically they are rather subtle .",
    "this is just as one would expect of an improvement that cures a significant limitation while retaining the strengths of the older method . in appendix",
    "a we outline the inclusion of the cosmological constant . again , while the previous quantum evolution shows certain departures from the classical theory even when the space - time curvature is low @xcite , the quantum evolution generated by the new hamiltonian constraint is free of this drawback . now",
    "the departures occur only in the deep planck regime near the big bang ( or the big crunch ) and lead to a replacement of the classical singularity by a quantum bounce .",
    "models discussed so far are too simple to be physically realistic . however , the methods introduced are rather general .",
    "in particular , as indicated at the end of section [ s2.1 ] , the ` @xmath67-strategy ' incorporates certain key features of full lqg .",
    "hence , results obtained in this paper provide concrete indications of how quantum geometry can lead to subtle yet important departures from the classical theory by making gravity repulsive in the deep planck regime .",

    "we direct the reader to that paper also for a detailed discussion of numerical analysis , physical ramifications of results and comparisons with other approaches that also feature emergent time and/or quantum bounce .    finally ,",
    "as emphasized in section [ s1 ] , a key limitation of the present work is that the theory is not obtained through a systematic symmetry reduction of full lqg .",
    "this is inevitable at present because our understanding of the full quantum dynamics of lqg is still very incomplete .",
    "the overall framework _ is _ constructed by following strategies developed in full lqg . however , an important difference arose in the introduction of the hamiltonian constraint operator because our mini - superspace reduction is carried out by gauge fixing and is therefore not diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "as a result , in the last step we had to use some physical considerations and borrow the expression of the area gap @xmath2 from the full theory .",
    "the strategy in lqc is to begin with simple models and work one s way up by incorporating the lessons learned along the way .",
    "improved dynamics discussed in this paper is an interesting example of such lessons .",

    "our goal is only to test whether the quantum bounce scenario is robust and if the @xmath67-evolution is free of the undesirable features of the @xmath56-evolution , such as departures from the classical theory at low values of total energy densities @xcite . therefore the numerical simulations are not as refined as in the main body of the paper .",

    "a positive @xmath438 is favored by current observations . for completeness we will discuss both the cases and ask whether general features of the @xmath439 analysis persist .",
    "the classical hamiltonian constraint is of the form @xmath440 from hamilton s equations it is easy to see that the momentum @xmath441 is again a constant of motion and the scalar field @xmath138 is a monotonic function of time .",
    "hence it is well suited to play the role of emergent time in the quantum theory .    the quantization procedure and the construction of the physical hilbert space ( and observables ) for the case @xmath442 is completely analogous to that in the model with @xmath439 .",

    "( thus , we follow ` method i ' of section v.b.2 of @xcite ) . as discussed there , while this method is not as optimal as the one used in main body of this paper , it has the advantage that it does not require the knowledge about properties of the eigenfuncions of @xmath444 .",

    "then again a bounce is observed . in effect",
    "the evolution is periodic : each ` cycle ' of classical evolution is connected through quantum bridge with previous / next cycle . both the big bang and big crunch singularities are resolved and replaced by quantum bounces .",
    "the behavior of fluctuations of dirac observables is also periodic in the sense that the spread at a given point of the trajectory and after full cycle are the same .",

    "when cosmological constant is positive , classical trajectories , i.e. , solutions to , take the form @xmath475 as for @xmath439 we have then two types of trajectories . in one",
    "the universe starts from a big bang singularity , expands and reaches infinite value of @xmath84 for finite @xmath177 . in the other the universe contracts from the infinite volume state ( at a finite @xmath177 ) and reaches the big crunch singularity .",

    "<S> an improved hamiltonian constraint operator is introduced in loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> quantum dynamics of the spatially flat , isotropic model with a massless scalar field is then studied in detail using analytical and numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field continues to serve as ` emergent time ' , the big bang is again replaced by a quantum bounce , and quantum evolution remains deterministic across the deep planck regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , while with the hamiltonian constraint used so far in loop quantum cosmology the quantum bounce can occur even at low matter densities , with the new hamiltonian constraint it occurs only at a planck - scale density . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the new quantum dynamics retains the attractive features of current evolutions in loop quantum cosmology but , at the same time , cures their main weakness . </S>"
