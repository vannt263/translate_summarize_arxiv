    "the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is one of the central topics in the study of fe - based superconductors .",
    "similar to the high - t@xmath0 cuprates , the superconductivity in fe - based compounds is found to be in close proximity to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order@xcite .",
    "superconductivity emerges when the magnetic order was suppressed by electron or hole doping or application of pressure@xcite .",
    "although the phase diagram of fe - pnictides looks very similar to that of high-@xmath1 curpates , distinct differences exist between them .",
    "the undoped compounds in cuprates are mott insulators , by contrast , the parent compounds in fe - pnictides / chalcogenides are multiband metals . magnetic interaction effect also manifests in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 in both parent compounds above t@xmath3 and superconducting compounds above t@xmath0 is neither pauli- nor curie - weiss - like , instead it increases linearly with increasing temperature within measured temperature range.@xcite furthermore , the value of @xmath2 is roughly two orders larger than the value for a pauli paramagnetism .",
    "much debates have been focused on whether the magnetism has an itinerant electron or local moment interaction origin , an issue being intimately related to the pairing interaction for superconductivity .",
    "the complex magnetic properties arise from the multiple orbital nature of the systems .",
    "the electronic structures of the multiple orbital systems should be also reflected in the charge excitation spectra which could be probed by the optical spectroscopy technique .",
    "previous optical investigations on the parent compounds of afe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( a = ba , sr)@xcite revealed clearly the formation of the partial energy gaps at low energy in the magnetic phase , indicating the involvement of the itinerant electrons in the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order formation . nevertheless , the gap opening at low energy is not the sole spectral feature observed with decreasing temperature .",
    "as indicated in the early studies,@xcite there exists another remarkable temperature - dependent spectral feature at much higher energy scale . the spectral weight below @xmath55000 @xmath6(0.6 ev )",
    "is gradually suppressed with decreasing temperature and transferred to higher energy scale ( see the grey region in fig .",
    "this suppression is observed even at room temperature .",
    "this pseudogap - like behavior at such high energy scale is not expected for an usual metal .",
    "although most of the spectral weight at such high energy scale comes from the interband transitions , the temperature dependent part must have a different origin .",
    "it has been a long - standing mystery for the fe - based compounds ever since the optical spectra were collected@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we address this issue by examining the evolution of the high - energy pseudogap with electron- and hole - dopings .",
    "we found that the feature remains strong in the electron - doped side , including in the heavily electron - doped case where the compound is no longer superconducting , but it becomes much weaker in the heavily hole doped case .",
    "our analysis indicates that this high energy gap - like feature is closely related to the doping - induced crystal structural change , particularly the as - fe - as bond angle , or the height of as position relative to the fe layers .",
    "we elaborate that the high - energy feature is caused by the strong intra - atomic hund s rule coupling effect due to the presence of multiple fe 3d orbitals .",
    "our study supports the coexistence of itinerant and localized electrons in iron - pnictides , which would then lead to a more comprehensive picture about the metallic magnetism in the materials .",

    "we present four different samples : two k - doped ba@xmath7k@xmath8fe@xmath4as@xmath4 with x=0.4 ( t@xmath0=37 k ) and x=1 ( t@xmath0=3 k ) , and two co - doped bafe@xmath9co@xmath10as@xmath4 with y=0.2 ( t@xmath0=22 k ) and y=0.4 ( not superconducting ) .",
    "we also compare the measurement data with the parent compounds bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 and fe@xmath11te .",
    "it is well known that the k@xmath12 doping for ba@xmath13 introduces extra holes . on the other hand",
    ", nmr experiment indicated that co@xmath13 doping for fe@xmath13 does not induce local moment but offer one more d - electron to the system , therefore has the effect of electron - doping.@xcite roughly , t@xmath0=37 k and 22 k are close to the highest superconducting transition temperatures achieved by k - doing ( off feas plane ) and co - doping ( within feas plane ) , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ they are optimally doped .",

    "superconducting pairing energy gap features exist in the co - doped ( co=0.2 ) and k - doped ( k=0.4 ) superconducting samples at very low frequencies ( not visible clearly in the plot over such broad energy scale ) .",
    "clear sdw gap features were seen for the pure bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 sample .",
    "purely metallic temperature - dependent responses were observed for the heavily electron- or hole - doped samples .",
    "but here we focus our attention on the high energy gap - like spectral weight suppression features .        in optical reflectance spectrum r(@xmath16 )",
    ", the high energy structure manifests itself as a suppression of r(@xmath16 ) in the mid - infrared region ( about 2000 - 5000 @xmath6 ) .",
    "as the low-@xmath16 r(@xmath16 ) still increases towards unit due to metallic nature of the compounds , a reverse s - like shape in r(@xmath16 ) is resulted . in fig .",
    "3 we find that , compared to the parent bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 compounds , the reverse s - like shape r(@xmath16 ) remains rather eminent in the co - doped compounds . however , the feature becomes weaker in k=0.4 doped case , and tends to disappear in the pure kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 sample with t@xmath0 only 3 k. the feature is also not visible in fe@xmath11te .",
    "corresponding to the reverse s - like shape of r(@xmath16 ) , the real part of conductivity @xmath17 shows a suppression roughly below 5000 @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to a peak in @xmath17 near this energy , as shown in fig .",
    "our earlier study on the parent compound indicated that the suppressed spectral weight is transferred to higher energies,@xcite indicating a pseudogap - like phenomenon .",

    "4 . for the parent",
    "bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , a residual drude component exists in the sdw state.@xcite this residual drude component narrows with decreasing temperature , and its low - frequency limit approaches the dc conductivity value . as a result , the low-@xmath16 spectral weight , roughly below 200 @xmath6 , at low t is higher than at high t. above 200 @xmath6 , the sdw gap develops which strongly reduces the low - t drude weight , leading to the first suppression below 1000 @xmath6 .",
    "the lost drude weight fills into the sdw peak , and the total spectral weight is almost recovered around 2000 @xmath6for 10 k. however , the t - dependent suppression below the mid - infrared peak results in the second spectral weight suppression at 10 k near 3000 @xmath6 .",
    "the lost weight gradually recovers at very high energy , roughly about 10000 @xmath6 . for the co - doped x=0.2 crystal",
    ", there is no sdw gap developing at low temperature , the low-@xmath16 spectral weight change is induced by the drude component narrowing .",
    "a balance is seen near 1200 @xmath6 .",
    "the further reduction of the spectral weight beyond this frequency at low temperature is caused by the gap - like suppression near 5000 @xmath6 .",
    "once again , the recovery of the spectral weight extends to rather high energy scale .",
    "we should remark that , at such high energy scale , most of the spectral weight would come from the interband transitions .",
    "however , the temperature - dependent part must have a different origin .",
    "seen clearly from fig .",
    "3 , the pseudogap feature remains very strong for all co - doped superconducting samples , but become weak in the k - doped compounds and tends to vanish for the pure kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "no suppression feature is visible in @xmath17 for fe@xmath11te .",
    "the key issue here is the origin of this high energy pseudogap . unlike the spin - density - wave gap observed for the parent compounds only below magnetic ordering temperature ,",
    "the high energy pseudogap feature is present at all measurement temperatures as well as in the doped compounds , as indicated in fig .",
    "3 . there could be several possibilities for the presence of high energy peak structure .",
    "one possibility is that the quasi - particles contain not only the coherent spectral weight at low energy but also the incoherent part at high energies due to the presence of strong electron correlation effect.@xcite the high energy feature comes from the incoherent part of the quasi - particle spectral function .",
    "this should be a generic phenomenon for strongly correlated electron system . a schematic picture about the quasi - particle spectral weight function is shown in fig .",
    "the incoherent part is argued to originate from the onset hubbard u. a dynamical mean - field theory calculation indicated that both the incoherent structures at intermediate frequencies of the order u/2 to u and the coherent drude component at the lower end of the conductivity spectrum rapidly emerge as the temperature is lowered.@xcite this has been used to explain the experimental observation of development of both drude component and mid - infrared peak at low temperature in v@xmath4o@xmath20.@xcite however , this is different from the present case where the drude component already exists in fe - based compounds at high temperatures . furthermore , this picture is rather difficult to explain the doping evolution of the structure . in particular , fe@xmath11te is believed to have stronger electron correlation , but the temperature - dependent feature at mid - infrared is almost invisible . in fact , the conductivity spectrum in the mid - infrared region even has slightly lower values at lower temperature .",
    "( color online ) the spectral function of a correlated electron system .",
    "it contains both coherent part at low frequency and incoherent part at higher frequencies .",
    "the incoherent part could lead to sizeable spectral weight at mid - infrared region.,width=264 ]",
    "a different but related proposal is that the coherent spectrum at low frequency is due to the itinerant electrons from some fe 3d orbitals which form the disconnected electron and hole fermi surfaces , while the incoherent part is due to the hubbard u splitting of the localized bands from other fe 3d orbitals.@xcite the occupation of the electrons at the lower hubbard band results in the formation of local moments . in our opinion",
    ", this scenario also faces great challenges .",
    "the electron correlations in fe - based compounds are not so strong .",
    "the band renormalization factors were found to be only about 2 - 3.@xcite furthermore , some orbitals are almost degenerate .",
    "it is hard to image that those bands could be split by the relatively weak on - site electron correlation .    because the feature is temperature dependent",
    ", one may think that it is related to the spin - fluctuations .",
    "a naive idea is that the feature is caused by the indirect interband transitions assisted by the spin fluctuations with an afm ( @xmath21 ) wave vector .",
    "as shown schematically in fig .",
    "6 , the hole and electron bands are well connected by such commensurate wave vector * *",
    "q**=(@xmath22 ) in the bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 parent compound .",
    "the indirect interband transition could be realized through the assistance of ( @xmath21 ) spin fluctuations with the transition energy of _ _",
    "h@xmath23__=e@xmath24-e@xmath25+@xmath26 , where e@xmath25 and e@xmath24 are the energy levels of the initial and final states of the particle hole excitations , @xmath26 is the energy corresponding to the formation of fluctuated afm correlation which usually have a rather small energy scale .",
    "however , a careful examination indicates that this possibility is also unlikely .",
    "first , the bands close to the @xmath27 and m points are better connected by the ( @xmath21 ) wave vector , the lower energy region is expected to have higher indirect interband transition spectral weight with decreasing temperature , which is opposite to the suppression spectral feature at lower frequencies .",
    "second , the opposite trend between electron- and hole - dopings highly suggests against this scenario .",
    "the ( @xmath21 ) spin - fluctuations are believed to be strongly suppressed in either heavily electron- or hole - doped compounds .",
    "then , it is difficult to understand why they change in the opposite ways .     a schematic picture for the band structure evolution .",
    "for the parent bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , indirect interband transitions between the hole and electron bands could occur with the help of the * * q**=(@xmath21 ) af spin fluctuations .",
    "for the heavily hole - doped compound , e.g. pure kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 , the chemical potential shifts downward , which leads to the removal of the electron fs near m point and associated af correlation ( b ) .",
    "for the heavily electron ( co- ) doped case , the chemical potential shifts up , leading to the removal of the hole fs surface near @xmath27 ( c ) . in both cases , ( @xmath21 )",
    "af fluctuations are strongly suppressed .",
    "the spin fluctuation - assisted indirect interband transition should be significantly reduced.,width=283 ]    we propose that the high energy feature reflects the presence of local physics .",
    "the spectral weigh transfer from low energy to high energy implies a transfer of relatively itinerant electrons with binding energy less than 0.6 ev to the more localized part .",
    "a promising picture is as follows .",
    "the fe - pnictides / chalcogenides contain both itinerant electrons and local moments arising from different 3d orbitals of the iron atoms .",
    "unlike the proposals mentioned above , the local moment formation is not caused by the hubbard u interaction but mainly originate from the hund s rule coupling interaction of the different orbitals .",
    "if the hund s rule coupling energy is smaller than the kinetic energy ( or band width ) of electrons in some orbitals , those electrons are itinerant . on the other hand , if the hund s coupling energy",
    "is larger than the kinetic energy of the electrons in other orbitals , those electrons are localized and form local moments .",
    "in general , the itinerant electrons and local moments are not completely isolated , but are also coupled via the hund s rule interaction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we identify the energy scale of the suppression near 0.6 ev as the local hund s rule coupling energy scale .",
    "this value is indeed close to those estimated in a number of the theoretical works@xcite and a resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) experiment @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "the thermal excitations become weak , then a fraction of relatively itinerant electrons tend to become more localized .",
    "thus , we would expect to observe the spectral weight transfer from low energy to an energy scale higher than the hund s rule coupling energy .",
    "the above picture provides a natural explanation for the experimental observation in the optical measurement",
    ". nevertheless , there are two crucial questions which have to be addressed .",
    "first , why a relatively small change of temperature from 300 k to 10 k could lead to such an apparent spectral weight transfer over very broad frequency range , that is , from far below 0.6 ev to far above it ? second",
    ", why the spectral weight transfer feature evolves significantly with electron or hole doping ?     a schematic picture about the hund s coupling between itinerant electrons and local moments .",
    "the local moment tends to polarize the spin of the itinerant electrons in a ferromagnetic orientation . at low t",
    ", itinerant electrons tends to become more localized due to this coupling , leading to the spectral weigh transfer from low energy to higher energies.,width=283 ]    to understand the first question , we have to assume that the kinetic energies of the electrons in different fe 3d bands / orbitals are relatively close .",
    "some may be slightly larger than the hund s rule coupling energy , while others may be slightly smaller than the hund s rule coupling energy .",
    "in other words , the energy levels or bands that contribute to the local moments are rather close to the fermi level where itinerant electrons dominate , so that the temperature change could affect their interaction .",
    "indeed , the first principle band structure calculations on lafeaso and ba122 indicated that all 5 orbitals of fe 3d electrons are rather close in energy.@xcite the local moments estimated from the density function calculations are usually higher than @xmath28 , suggesting more than 2 electrons are localized which contribute to the local moments .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the element @xmath18-fe , which has been known for several decades for the presence of both itinerant and localized d electrons .",
    "it deserves to remark that the recent neutron @xcite and rixs experiments revealed presence of large local moments in both parent compounds above t@xmath3 and doped superconducting compounds above t@xmath0 .",
    "an important observation in the present work is that the spectral weight transfer feature changes with doping , particularly in the k - doped case . from the crystal structural characterization",
    ", it is found that the k - doping results in a continuous decrease of the a - axis but an increase of the c - axis parameters .",
    "more detailed analysis indicates that k - doping does not induce detectable change in the fe - as bonding length , but lead to a continuous decrease of as - fe - as angle ( the @xmath18 angle in the crystal structure shown in fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the height of as atom relative to the fe - layer is increasing .",
    "the as height in fete is further increased compared to fe - pnictides.@xcite on the contrary , the co - doping does not lead to an detectable change in the a - axis lattice parameter but only a slight decrease of c - axis parameter @xcite .",
    "according to the band structural calculations , the band structure is rather sensitive to the as height relative to the fe layer.@xcite the increase of as height mainly make the fe atom more isolated , leading to the narrowing the fe 3d bands . as a result ,",
    "the effective hund s rule coupling is enhanced.@xcite then the spectral weight suppression feature could not be seen within a temperature range change from 300 to 10 k. higher temperature range would be required in order to see the spectral weight transfer structure .",
    "we found that the picture could well explain the doing evolution and the disappearance of the feature in fe@xmath11te .",
    "finally , we comment on the spin - density - wave gap formation on the fe - pnictide compounds . based on the above study , the local moment formation itself is not due to the fermi surface nesting , but caused by the strong hund s rule coupling between different fe 3d orbitals .",
    "however , the fermi surfaces couple strongly with the magnetic instability .",
    "a spin - density - wave gap would open once the nesting of fs s matches with the magnetic wave vector .",
    "in conclusion , our measurement indicates that the feas compounds are not simple itinerant electron systems .",
    "the optical data of the 122 parent compound and their evolution with k- and co - doping revealed spectral change not only at low but also considerable high frequencies . the spectral structure and",
    "its evolution implies the presence of both itinerant and localized electrons arising from different fe 3d orbitals .",
    "we elaborate that the spectral weight transfer over the broad energies is related to the hund s rule coupling between itinerant and localized electrons .",
    "the coupling effect could be strongly affected by the environment of fe atom , i.e. the bonding angle of as - fe - as or the height of as atom relative to the fe layer .",
    "our experiments demonstrate the coexistence of itinerant and localized electrons in iron - based compounds , which would then lead to a more comprehensive picture about the metallic magnetism in the materials .",
