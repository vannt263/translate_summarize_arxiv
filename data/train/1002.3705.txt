    "the possibility of superfluidity inside neutron stars was suggested a long time ago by migdal  @xcite , only two years after the formulation of the theory of electron superconductivity by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs )  @xcite and before the discovery of the first pulsars .",
    "this prediction was later supported by the observation of the long relaxation time of the order of months following the first observed glitch in the vela pulsar  @xcite .",
    "glitches were subsequently observed in other pulsars .",
    "pulsar glitches are believed to be related to the dynamics of the neutron superfluid permeating the inner layers of the solid neutron star crust  @xcite .",
    "understanding the properties of this neutron superfluid is also of prime importance for modeling the cooling of newly - born neutron stars  @xcite and strongly magnetised neutron stars  @xcite , the thermal relaxation of quasi - persistent x - ray transients  @xcite or the quasi - periodic oscillations recently detected in the giant flares of soft - gamma repeaters  @xcite .",
    "so far most microscopic studies of neutron superfluidity have been devoted to the case of uniform infinite neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "however the coherence length of the neutron superfluid in the neutron - star crust is typically smaller than the lattice spacing and may even be comparable to the size of the nuclear clusters in some layers  @xcite ( see also section 8.2.3 of ref .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast to that encountered in ordinary type i electron superconductors , for which the electron cooper pairs are spatially extended over macroscopic distances so that the order parameter is essentially uniform  @xcite ( note that neutron stars are much too hot for electrons to be superconducting there , see for instance the discussion in section 8.1 of ref .",
    "the effects of the inhomogeneities on neutron superfluidity in neutron - star crust have been studied in the mean - field approximation with realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials  @xcite and effective nucleon - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",
    "systematic fully self - consistent calculations in the entire inner crust ( at zero temperature ) have been recently carried out using semi - microscopic energy functionals  @xcite . in this latter work , it was found that even though inhomogeneities are small in the densest regions of the crust , the @xmath0s@xmath1 neutron pairing gaps are strongly reduced compared to those in uniform neutron matter .",
    "moreover the weaker the pairing force is , the stronger is the suppression of the gaps . in somes cases ,",
    "the gaps even almost completely vanish .",
    "all these quantum calculations have been carried out in the wigner - seitz ( w - s ) approximation according to which the lattice is decomposed into a set of identical spherical cells centered around each cluster .",
    "the radius of each sphere is chosen so that its volume is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cluster density ( number of lattice sites per unit volume ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , two different boundary conditions yielding an almost constant neutron density @xmath4 near the cell edge , can be chosen . while the difference in the predicted pairing gaps are small for average nucleon densities @xmath5 @xmath6 , the uncertainties become increasingly large in the deeper layers of the crust  @xcite .",
    "this limitation of the w - s method is related to the existence of spurious neutron shell effects due to the discretisation of the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "energy spectrum  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the first calculations of neutron superfluidity in neutron - star crusts going beyond the w - s approach by using the bcs theory of anisotropic multi - band superconductivity .",
    "this theory is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "our model of the neutron - star crust are discussed in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the solutions of the bcs equations are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we have focused on the deepest regions of the crust , for average nucleon densities @xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath6 , where the results from the w - s approximation are the most uncertain  @xcite . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    ", we discuss the validity of the local density approximation ( lda ) and the importance of proximity effects .",
    "the disappearance of superfluidity with increasing temperature is studied in sections  [ sec6 ] and [ sec7 ] . in section  [ sec8 ] ,",
    "we present numerical results of the neutron specific heat .",
    "the standard formulation of the bcs theory starts with the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for bloch states with wave vector @xmath13 , band index @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the s.p .",
    "energies ( assumed to be independent of the spin state ) , @xmath17 the chemical potential and @xmath18 are the matrix elements of the two - body pairing interaction . in the mean - field approximation at finite temperature ,",
    "the quasi - particle ( q.p . ) energies are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are solutions of the anisotropic multi - band bcs gap equations ( setting the boltzmann constant @xmath21 ) @xmath22 in conventional superconductors the pairing interaction is induced by electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "it is usually a very good approximation to take the matrix elements @xmath23 as constant and non - zero only within a small energy shell of the order @xmath24 around the fermi level , where @xmath25 is the ion - plasma frequency . in this case",
    "the gap parameters @xmath20 depend neither on the band index @xmath14 nor on the wave vector @xmath13 and are all equal to a single constant , the pairing gap @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of multi - band superconductors characterized by the existence of several pairing gaps @xmath27 was raised soon after the formulation of the bcs theory  @xcite , but clear experimental evidence was lacking until the discovery in 2001 of superconductivity in magnesium diboride , whose unusual properties can be nicely explained by a two - band model  @xcite . since then",
    "many other multi - band superconductors have been found such as the iron pnictide superconductors  @xcite . in these materials",
    ", several bands can intersect the fermi level , yielding a complex multi - sheeted fermi surface .",
    "pairing is still thought to be mediated by the exchange of phonons but the electrons on the different sheets of the fermi surface feel very different pairing interactions leading to the existence of different gaps . in neutron - star crust ,",
    "the formation of neutron pairs giving rise to superfluidity is directly triggered by the strong neutron - neutron interaction which is always attractive at low densities in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel .",
    "the number of bands contributing appreciably to the pairing gap @xmath20 can thus be huge ( about @xmath28 in the dense layers of the inner crust considered in this work ) .",
    "since the matrix elements of the pairing force may _ a priori _ vary appreciably , we have solved eqs .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) in the most general case .",
    "we have determined the equilibrium structure and composition of the inner crust of neutron stars by using the fourth - order extended thomas - fermi method with quantum shell effects added via the strutinsky - integral theorem .",
    "this so - called etfsi method , as applied to the equation of state of neutron - star crusts , has been described in detail in ref .",
    "it is a high - speed approximation to the self - consistent hartree - fock method .",
    "we have neglected the small neutron shell effects  @xcite , the estimation of which in current calculations is plagued by the approximate treatment of the interaction between the unbound neutrons and the nuclear lattice  @xcite .",

    "the parameters of this force are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this force is particularly suitable for studying neutron - rich environments such as neutron - star crusts since it has been constrained to reproduce the equation of state and the @xmath44 pairing gap of infinite homogeneous neutron matter , as calculated for the realistic argonne v@xmath45 potential and shown in fig .",

    "nuclear clusters have a very diffuse surface as can be seen in fig.[fig2 ] , and consequently the spin - orbit coupling is much smaller than that in isolated nuclei  @xcite .",
    "although neutron shell effects represent a small correction to the total energy density  @xcite , they are expected to have a much stronger impact on neutron superfluidity due to the highly non - linear nature of the pairing phenomenon .",

    "<S> the neutron superfluidity in the inner crust of a neutron star has been traditionally studied considering either homogeneous neutron matter or only a small number of nucleons confined inside the spherical wigner - seitz cell . </S>",
    "<S> drawing analogies with the recently discovered multi - band superconductors , we have solved the anisotropic multi - band bcs gap equations with bloch boundary conditions , thus providing a unified description taking consistently into account both the free neutrons and the nuclear clusters . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been carried out using the effective interaction underlying our recent hartree - fock - bogoliubov nuclear mass model hfb-16 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that even though the presence of inhomogeneities lowers the neutron pairing gaps , the reduction is much less than that predicted by previous calculations using the wigner - seitz approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the disappearance of superfluidity with increasing temperature . as an application we have calculated the neutron specific heat , which is an important ingredient for modeling the thermal evolution of newly - born neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides a new scheme for realistic calculations of superfluidity in neutron - star crusts . </S>"
