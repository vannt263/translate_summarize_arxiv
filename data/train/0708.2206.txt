    "<S> curved textures of ferroelectric smectic c * liquid crystals produce space charge when they involve divergence of the spontaneous polarization field . </S>",
    "<S> impurity ions can partially screen this space charge , reducing long range interactions to local ones . through studies of the textures of islands on very thin free - standing smectic films , we see evidence of this effect , in which materials with a large spontaneous polarization have static structures described by a large effective bend elastic constant . to address this issue , we calculated the electrostatic free energy of a free standing film of ferroelectric liquid crystal , showing how the screened coulomb interaction contributes a term to the effective bend elastic constant , in the static long wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> we report experiments which support the main features of this model .    the inclusion of sub - micron particles in a very thin free standing ferroelectric smectic c ( sm - c * ) film induces the growth of islands , circular regions of thicker material , usually with a central point topological defect surrounded by a texture which satisfies certain boundary conditions and minimizes an appropriate free energy@xcite . in the simplest case </S>",
    "<S> , this is a pure bend texture , with the molecules oriented tangentially everywhere in the island , and the topological defect , or disclination , at the center . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a radial spontaneous polarization @xmath0 whose divergence produces space charge@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the electrostatic interaction in this pure bend island should play an important role in the energetics of the liquid crystal texture . in our initial studies@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a purely elastic analysis of the free energy of the observed textures , and found that our observations of textural transitions as a function of island diameter were well explained by a large ratio of bend to splay elastic constants . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that this large ratio correlated with a large spontaneous polarization in the material studied . </S>",
    "<S> this suggested that the observed large effective bend elastic constant actually arose from the electrostatic interaction . in this paper , we report experiments and theory which develop the evidence for this scenario , which explains well our observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the long range electrostatic interaction arising from divergence of the spontaneous polarization field has been studied previously , as has the screening of that interaction by dissolved impurity ions in the liquid crystal@xcite . in sm - c * free standing films , the impurity ion effect first was observed qualitatively by pindak _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the screening effect by impurity ions in sm - c * free standing films was studied experimentally in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically okano showed that in the long wavelength limit in a bulk ferroelectric liquid crystal , the screened coulomb interaction reduced to an effective bend elastic constant , whose magnitude depends on the concentration of impurity ions and the size of the spontaneous polarization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis followed that of palierne , who discussed the ionic screening of the electric field produced by the flexoelectric polarization in the nematic phase in three dimensions @xcite . for a thin film , </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of screening effects is different , since the sources of the electric field and the screening ions are confined to two dimensions , while the field propagates in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we thought that such ionic screening of the space charge arising from spontaneous polarization might change the long range electrostatic energy into a local effective elastic term even in the case of thin films .    ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) islands seen in cs1015 , a low spontaneous polarization material(6.6 nc/@xmath1).,width=192 ]    a textural transformation which we have studied in the islands is from a pure bend ( tangential ) pattern to a reversing spiral texture@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the reversing spiral texture , shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : islands ] ( a ) the tangential boundary conditions of the c - director ( a unit vector parallel to the projection of the tilted molecular orientation direction on the plane of the film ) still apply at both the outer boundary and the point defect at the center , but the c - director switches to a radial orientation between these two limits . </S>",
    "<S> this partially replaces bend with splay deformation , reducing the elastic energy if the splay elastic constant is less than the bend elastic constant . as islands grow </S>",
    "<S> , this transition occurs at a critical island size , which is then a measure of the relative magnitudes of these two elastic constants . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the textures of islands in commercial ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures , which have a sm - c * phase at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures we used are the cs series(cs1015 , cs1024 , cs2005 ) by chisso and the ro series(ro318 , ro322 , ro330 ) by rodic . based on the company specifications , measured at room temperature , cs1024 and cs2005 have relatively high spontaneous polarization(46.7 nc/@xmath1 and 72.6 nc/@xmath1 , respectively ) and cs1015 , ro318 , ro322 , and ro330 are very low spontaneous polarization materials(6.6 nc/@xmath1 , 3 nc/@xmath1 , 3.8 nc/@xmath1 , and 3.8 nc/@xmath1 , respectively ) .    </S>",
    "<S> islands commonly created in cs1024 and cs1015 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : islands](a ) and ( b ) . in islands on the film with a high spontaneous polarization </S>",
    "<S> , the pure bend texture is rarely seen . </S>",
    "<S> most of them show a reversing spiral texture or a boojum texture.(fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : islands](a ) ) on the other hand , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : islands](b ) , all of the islands are pure bend islands or boojum islands at equilibrium ; ro318 , ro322 , and ro330 show very similar textures , in which a reversing spiral island is observed only at an unusually large island size . </S>",
    "<S> we also never observed pure bend islands in a ferroelectric liquid crystal compound with an extremely high spontaneous polarization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the reversing spiral texture , which is an indicator of a large ratio of bend to splay elastic constants , is directly correlated with a large spontaneous polarization .        to observe the spontaneous polarization dependence of the textural transition from a pure bend into a reversing spiral , we investigated the textures of islands created in mixtures of two ferroelectric liquid crystals with high and low spontaneous polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the critical size for a pure bend island to start to change into a reversing spiral texture was measured as the ratio of the two materials was varied , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ongoing ] , where data on mixtures of cs1024 and cs1015 and cs2005 and ro318 are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the real time transformation is shown in ref.@xcite the islands marked by the arrow are just initiating the transformation to the reversing spiral texture . </S>",
    "<S> bigger islands than the marked ones have already transformed into the reversing spiral texture , but smaller islands are still in the pure bend texture </S>",
    "<S> . a higher proportion of the material with high spontaneous polarization causes a pure bend island to transform into a reversing spiral texture at a smaller critical radius . </S>",
    "<S> other mixtures of the high and low spontaneous polarization materials show very similar behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> .spontaneous polarization and elastic constants determined by the electric field quenching experiment . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to relate our study of the quasi - static textural transformation to fundamental liquid crystal properties , we undertook measurements of fundamental liquid crystal properties of the mixtures in which we made textural observations . knowing that the screening of the space charges by mobile ions is a slow process </S>",
    "<S> , we undertook measurements of the elastic properties of these thin films in fast dynamic processes , to obtain values of `` bare '' elastic constants , as well as spontaneous polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the elastic constants and spontaneous polarizations of the free standing films ( 4 smectic layers thick ) created by cs1024 , cs1015 , and their mixtures by monitoring the change of intensity of light scattered by c - director fluctuations due to quenching of the fluctuations by a strong electric field pulse , following the work of rosenblatt _ _ et al.__@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are listed in table  [ tab : constants ] . </S>",
    "<S> as we expected , a larger proportion of the higher spontaneous polarization material increases the spontaneous polarization of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bare splay elastic constants measured with fast dynamics were found to be larger than the bend elastic constants in the mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> this should favor the pure bend texture , in disagreement with our observations in the quasi - static limit , which indicated that the bend elastic constant is larger . </S>",
    "<S> this supported our guess that the screened electrostatic interactions were contributing to the apparently large quasi - static bend elastic constant .    to address this issue theoretically , we calculate the electrostatic free energy of a very thin film . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the liquid crystal film lies in the plane @xmath2 , surrounded by vacuum on both sides . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically we treat the film as infinitesimally thin , but introduce the film thickness @xmath3 in an appropriate dimensional fashion . denoting the dielectric constant of the film ( assumed to be spatially uniform ) by @xmath4 , the dielectric function for the three  dimensional space is given by : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5    gauss law then reads :    @xmath6=4\\pi\\rho(\\bm{r}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the sum of the ionic and ferroelectric space charge densities respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these densities are proportional to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are three  dimensional vectors .    </S>",
    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ epsilon ] ) , gauss law can be rewritten as , @xmath11&= & \\bm{\\nabla\\cdot}[(1+(\\varepsilon-1 ) a \\delta(z))\\bm{e}]\\\\ \\nonumber & = & ( 1+(\\varepsilon-1 ) a\\delta(z))\\bm{\\nabla\\cdot e}\\\\ & & + ( \\varepsilon-1 ) ae_z \\delta^\\prime ( z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 . introducing the electrostatic scalar potential @xmath13 defined as usual by @xmath14 we obtain a poisson  like equation from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gauss ] ) , @xmath15    we now treat the ionic charge density using the debye  hckel approximation . </S>",
    "<S> assuming there are _ n _ species of ionic impurities , and that the average concentration of the @xmath16 type of impurity is @xmath17 , the local concentration @xmath18 of this impurity at position @xmath19 is given by the boltzmann distribution : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the charge of the impurity of type _ </S>",
    "<S> i _ , and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the total ionic charge density at position @xmath19 is then given by : @xmath23    we insert this charge density into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : poisson ] ) , and linearize in @xmath24 to obtain a poisson  boltzmann equation : @xmath25    replacing the space charge @xmath26 by a delta function source , we obtain the equation obeyed by the green s function @xmath27 associated with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pb1 ] ) : @xmath28 where , the inverse two  dimensional ( 2d ) debye screening length @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30 fourier transforming eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pb2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the projection of @xmath33 in the plane of the film , and we have used the fact that g is an even function of @xmath34 . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ greeneqn ] ) we find : @xmath35    integrating both sides of this equation over @xmath34 we obtain : @xmath36 which we will now use to obtain an expression for the screened electrostatic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic energy @xmath37 of the film is given by : @xmath38 where the space charge @xmath39 . in terms of the green s function @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath37 can be expressed as :    @xmath41    which in fourier space yields : @xmath42 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gq ] ) we obtain : @xmath43    in the long  wavelength limit , where @xmath44 is much smaller than the inverse 2d screening length @xmath29 , @xmath37 simplifies to : @xmath45    the polarization vector is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the magnitude of a spontaneous polarization . using this expression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ freenergy ] ) we find : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the 2d debye screening length .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , the total free energy of the film including the frank elastic energy is @xmath50d\\bm{r}_{\\perp}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the splay and bend elastic constants respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus the screening by the impurity ions has rendered the elastic free energy density local . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an effective bend elastic constant can be defined : @xmath53 similar to the result obtained for bulk ferroelectric liquid crystals @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the electrostatic energy due to space charge created by divergence of the spontaneous polarization , screened by impurity ions dissolved in the liquid crystal , can become a local effective term in the elastic free energy in the case @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a term @xmath55 can dominate the bare bend elastic constant @xmath52 in that limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the change of the critical size for the transition from a pure bend island to a reversing spiral , when varying the spontaneous polarization or the concentration of the impurity ions , which tunes @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of large spontaneous polarization and low concentration of screening ions produces the largest increase in the effective bend elastic constant .    in order to see the effect of the impurity ions , we added free ions to the material to reduce the 2d debye screening length as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kappa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we doped our ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures with an organic salt , tetrabutylammonium bromide(tbab ) ( 99@xmath57 purity by acros organic ) at saturated concentration in a mixture of ro318 and cs2005 with a composition ratio of 1:5 . before the salt was added , reversing spiral islands existed at a small size ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : impurity](a ) ) . as shown in the top of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : impurity](b ) , most of islands on the film doped with tbab are in the pure bend texture . reversing spiral islands only appear at a larger critical size than seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : impurity](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this result is qualitative , it indicates the trend of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> it would be desirable to find an appropriate salt with greater solubility , and to make quantitative measurements of ionic concentration for this experiment .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the textural transformation from a pure bend island to a reversing spiral texture in islands on thin films of smectic c * ferroelectric liquid crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the transition size of the islands depends on the spontaneous polarization of the material . </S>",
    "<S> based on this observation , we proposed that the spontaneous polarization and debye screening length regulate the effective bend elastic constant in the long wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> the typical debye screening length in these materials has subsequently been measured to be about 0.7@xmath58@xcite , in separate experiments to be reported elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> our typical island size is tens of micrometers , so the conditions for use of this effective bend elastic constant to describe the electrostatic energy appear to be reasonable . as a qualitative test of this model </S>",
    "<S> , we observed that added impurity ions reduced the effective bend elastic constant . </S>"
