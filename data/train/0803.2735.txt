    "the standard computation of the relic densities relies on the assumptions that @xmath1 was large enough for the particles of interest to have reached thermal equilibrium and that the entropy of matter and radiation is conserved after they decouple . however , there are non - standard cosmological models in which these assumptions about the epoch of the universe before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , an epoch from which we have no data , do not hold .",

    "this temperature may have been as low as @xmath24  mev  @xcite once all cosmological data are taken into account , while bbn - only data impose a lower bound of @xmath22  mev on @xmath1  @xcite if active neutrino oscillations are taken into account ( up from @xmath20.7  mev  @xcite if they are not ) .",
    "it is well known that a low reheating temperature inhibits the production of particles which are non - relativistic or decoupled at @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the final number density of active neutrinos starts departing from the standard number for @xmath4  mev but stays within 10% , 20% or 50% of it for @xmath5  mev , 4  mev and 3  mev , respectively . for @xmath6  mev the number of tau- and muon - neutrinos would be about 2.7% of the standard number  @xcite .",
    "low @xmath1 cosmological scenarios are more complicated than the standard ones",
    ". different aspects of these models have been studied with interesting results , but no consistent all - encompassing scenario exists yet .",
    "baryogenesis could be produced through the affleck - dine mechanism , in a model similar to that of ref .",

    "the regions globally excluded by laboratory measurements ( section  [ lab ] ) are : the dark gray ( blue ) area for @xmath154 mixing , the region to the right of the red short - dashed line for @xmath155 mixing and that to the right of the ( magenta ) long - dashed line for @xmath156 mixing . in the case of @xmath154 mixing the bounds for majorana neutrinos are more restrictive than for dirac neutrinos ( see the hatched dark gray ( blue ) area labeled as `` @xmath233decay '' ) .",

    "sterile neutrinos are invoked in many extensions of the standard model of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "however , it is commonly assumed that the cosmological and astrophysical bounds on the mixings of sterile and active neutrinos restrict the range of their allowed values much more than laboratory data .",
    "in fact , sterile neutrinos with parameters suitable to be found in the near future in different experiments would have mixings with active neutrinos too large to be allowed by the standard cosmological assumptions about the pre - bbn era in the universe , an era about which we do not have any observational information .",
    "the standard assumptions are few but very powerful : it is usually assumed that the temperature reached in the radiation dominated epoch before bbn was very high , that the universe was radiation dominated then and that the entropy of radiation and matter is conserved .    here",
    ", we show that it is possible to evade most of the cosmological bounds by assuming that the temperature at the end of ( the last episode of ) inflation or entropy production , the so - called reheating temperature @xmath1 , is low enough .",
    "we concentrate on massive ( mostly sterile ) neutrinos heavier than 1  mev , having previously dealt with the lighter ones  @xcite . for low @xmath1 ,",
    "the production of sterile neutrinos is suppressed as shown in fig .",
    "[ ns ] . for example , going from @xmath239 to @xmath240 there is a suppression of four orders of magnitude .",
    "we present the experimental bounds on sterile neutrino mixings and the cosmological bounds imposed by the diffuse extragalactic background radiation , the cmb , bbn and the abundance of light elements .",
    "we find that for @xmath241 a few times smaller @xmath7 the cosmological bounds weaken significantly and for @xmath199 they disappear completely .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ ratio-1 ] ,  [ ratio-3 ] ,  [ ratio-10 ] . in fig .",
    "[ t=5 ] we keep instead the reheating temperature at a fixed value @xmath242  mev , close to the lower bound on @xmath1 of 4  mev imposed by bbn and other cosmological data . in this case , no cosmological bounds remain for @xmath243  mev , thus the only constraints on sterile neutrinos in this mass range come from terrestrial experiments .",
    "hence , unlike in the standard cosmology , in low reheating temperature cosmologies it is possible to accommodate  visible \" sterile neutrinos , i.e. , sterile neutrinos which could soon be found in experiments .",
    "cosmological scenarios with a very low reheating temperature are more complicated than the standard one .",
    "although no consistent all - encompassing model of this nature exists at present , different aspects have been studied with interesting results , which suggest that a coherent scenario could be produced if an experimental indication would lead us to it .",
    "in fact , finding a particle , such as a  visible \" sterile neutrino , whose existence would contradict the usual assumptions about the pre - bbn era , would give us not only invaluable information for particle physics , but also an indication of enormous relevance in cosmology : it would tell us that the usual assumptions must be modified , for example in the manner presented in this paper .",
