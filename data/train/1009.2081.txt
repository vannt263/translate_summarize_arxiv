    "any given redshift is a major goal for the next - generation large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; ivezi et al .",
    "lsst will probe the luminosity function to @xmath10 at @xmath11 , breaking the luminosity - redshift degeneracy that arises in current flux - limited samples such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which can only detect @xmath12 quasars at @xmath13 .",
    "also , our understanding of agn fueling mechanisms and the detailed physics of accretion disks is far from complete ( for a review , see mchardy  2010 ) .",
    "therefore , larger and more representative samples will only provide more potential for discovery .",
    "unfortunately , the resemblance of unresolved quasars ( i.e. , type i broad line agn ) to stars in photometric surveys poses a difficulty in their identification .",
    "quasars can be reliably identified by their spectra , and the sdss provides a spectroscopically complete survey to @xmath14 for the quasar region in sdss color space ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) which includes @xmath0105,000 quasars ( schneider et al .",
    "however , it is becoming increasingly important to identify quasars in the absence of spectra , particularly since complete spectroscopy will be too expensive in upcoming large - area sky surveys .",
    "previously , quasar selection in the absence of spectroscopy has best been achieved using @xmath15 and @xmath16 colors ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2002 ; jiang et al .  2006 ; richards et al .",
    "this technique requires multiple filters and results in samples with efficiencies ) is equivalent to `` purity '' ( @xmath17 ) in schmidt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . ] as low as 73% , and there is a redshift regime near @xmath18 where optical color selection largely fails . the upcoming large - area sky surveys , such as lsst and pan - starrs ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) , plan to use their time - domain information to separate quasars from stars .",
    "in addition to color selection , it is expected that the lack of proper motion and selection by photometric variability properties will result in fairly clean samples with an efficiency much higher than the color - based 73% .",
    "also , having an alternative method to color selection is needed to avoid a bias against extincted systems with non - standard colors .",
    "however , until very recently , it was not clear how variability could be used in a quantitative fashion to achieve these goals .",
    "a simple way of using variability to separate quasars from stars is to take advantage of the fact that quasars are generally more variable than stars .",
    "sesar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) demonstrated that at least 90% of quasars have a root - mean - square ( rms ) variability of at least 0.03 mag .",
    "however , the rms by itself does not enable the separation of quasars from other variable objects such as rr  lyrae . a recent study by schmidt et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter schm10 ) showed that by measuring the rms as a function of time lag ( @xmath19 ) between observations , i.e. , the structure function @xmath20 , the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 enable the separation of quasars and stars with great efficiency ( @xmath2395% for ultraviolet - excess objects ) .",
    "this separation is efficient because the rms of quasar variability is a few times less on monthly than on yearly time scales .",
    "boutsia et al .  (",
    "2009 ) showed that the variability of agn enables their selection even for extended , host - dominated agn ( and x - ray quiet agn ) .",
    "an important piece of information missing from these analyses is the characteristic time scale for quasar variability , @xmath1 .",
    "studies by de vries et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and sesar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using sdss combined with earlier palomar observatory sky survey measurements for 40,000 sdss quasars constrained quasar continuum variability on time scales of 10 to 50 years in the observer s frame .",
    "they report that the characteristic time scale , which in this context is the time lag above which @xmath24 flattens to a constant value , is of order 1 year in the quasar rest frame .",
    "recently , kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter kbs09 ) proposed a model where the optical variability of a given quasar is described by a damped random walk ( drw ) .",
    "the difference with respect to the well - known random walk is that an additional self - correcting term pushes any deviations back towards the mean flux on a time scale @xmath1 .",
    "it has been established by kbs09 , kozowski et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter koz10 ) , and macleod et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that a drw can statistically explain the observed light curves of quasars at an impressive fidelity level ( 0.01 - 0.02 mag ) .",
    "the model has only three free parameters : the mean value of the light curve , the driving amplitude of the stochastic process , and the damping ( or characteristic ) time scale @xmath1 .",
    "the predictions are only statistical , and the random nature reflects our uncertainty about the details of the physical processes .",
    "koz10 showed that the drw model is an efficient quantitative method to separate quasars from most variable stars even in the dense stellar environments of the magellanic clouds .    here , we test quasar selection in extragalactic fields by applying the drw model to the individual light curves of @xmath010,000 variable point sources with @xmath14 from sdss stripe 82 ( s82 ) .",
    "this was also recently done by butler & bloom ( 2010 , hereafter b&b ) using a different approach based on the drw model .",
    "about 15% of these sources are spectroscopically confirmed quasars whose variability properties have been analyzed in detail by macleod et al .",
    "we extend the selection technique in schm10 by including information on the characteristic ( damping ) time scale , extend the study of koz10 to an extragalactic survey with extensive spectroscopic data , and extend the study in b&b by applying the drw model to individual light curves rather than to the ensemble variability of quasars .",
    "we describe our variability model in section  [ sec : method ] , describe the s82 data set in section  [ sec : data ] , and present our results in terms of efficiency and completeness in section  [ sec : results ] . in section",
    "[ sec : lsst ] , we explore the effects that the light curve length , cadence , and photometric errors have on the best - fit drw parameters . we investigate the performance of the quasar selection technique presented here , in koz10 , and in b&b , for typical ( simulated ) lsst and pan - starrs cadences .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we model the time variability of quasars as a stochastic process described by the exponential covariance matrix @xmath25 between times @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "as detailed by kbs09 and koz10 , this corresponds to a drw ( more specifically , an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ) with a damping , or characteristic , time scale @xmath1 , and a long - term standard deviation of variability @xmath28 .",
    "the driving amplitude of short - term variations is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "following koz10 , we model the light curves and estimate the parameters and their uncertainties using the method of press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , its generalization in rybicki & press ( 1992 ) , and the fast computational implementation described in rybicki & press ( 1994 ) .",
    "koz10 demonstrate that this approach is more statistically powerful than the forecasting methods used by kbs09 , while still having computation times scaling linearly with the number of data points .    as in macleod",
    "( 2010 ) , we express the long - term variability in terms of the structure function ( sf ) , where the sf is the rms magnitude difference as a function of the time lag ( @xmath19 ) between measurements .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the sf to reach an asymptotic value @xmath2 is the damping time scale , @xmath1 .",
    "the sf for a drw is @xmath30 and the asymptotic value at large @xmath19 is @xmath31 for short time lags , @xmath32 therefore , @xmath33 regulates the rise of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath33 parameter is related to @xmath22 in the equation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 were used to select quasars in schm10 .",
    "however , @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not provide unique information on the characteristic time scale @xmath1 ( although since @xmath35 , there is some information on @xmath1 ) .",
    "while we obtain individual estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath33 for every light curve , in b&b @xmath1 and @xmath33 are estimated based on the apparent magnitude , which follows from modeling the ensemble sf as a drw as a function of magnitude .",
    "we discuss this difference further in section  [ sec : comparebb ] .    in section  [ sec : results ] , we demonstrate that the inclusion of @xmath1 , in addition to @xmath33 , in the selection of quasars enables the selection of highly pure samples with high completeness .",

    "the light curves span about ten years , and the observations are clustered into yearly seasons about 23 months long .",
    "there are on average more than 60 available epochs . because some observations were obtained in non - photometric conditions , improved calibration techniques have been applied to the sdss s82 data by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and sesar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and we use their results . for these data , photometric zero - point errors are 0.010.02 mag .",
    "we apply the drw model to all objects in the s82 variable point source catalog ( ivezi et al .",
    "these are objects with at least ten observations , an rms of variability in the @xmath38 and @xmath44 bands exceeding 0.05 mag , and a @xmath45 per degree of freedom exceeding 3 for the light curves in these bands being fit with a constant flux .",
    "we only include observations spaced by at least half a day apart when applying the model , since we are interested in the selection of quasars which generally vary on longer time scales than variable stars .",
    "the s82 data set is spectroscopically complete for @xmath14 in the quasar region of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 color space ( richards et al .",

    "we include newly confirmed dr7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) quasars , and limit our data set to the 52,547 variable objects with @xmath14 when evaluating quasar selection based on variability ( section  [ sec : compeff ] ) . in this sample , there are 1,912 ( 4% ) spectroscopically identified quasars .    the distribution of the known quasars in ra is compared to the distribution of all variable sources in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ra_i_hist ] .",
    "the quasar counts fall off at ra  @xmath50 deg , while the full distribution rises due to the rising density of galactic stars .",
    "therefore , we further restrict our sample to the 10,024 objects with @xmath51  ra  @xmath52 in order to minimize the stellar contamination from the galaxy .",
    "this sample of 10,024 variable sources , including 1,490 ( 15% ) spectroscopically confirmed quasars , defines our final sample when evaluating quasar selection based on variability in section  [ sec : compeff ] .",
    "however , to demonstrate the performance in regions of increased stellar density , we also compare to the results for the region @xmath51  ra  @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to note that for variable objects , the single - epoch @xmath49 magnitudes can be very different from the best - fit mean magnitudes from the drw model , @xmath54 , since the latter are based on the entire time series . in figure",
    "[ fig : mui ] , the distribution of @xmath55 is shown as a function of @xmath54 for s82 quasars .",
    "it is centered on zero with the @xmath56 range spanning almost @xmath57 mag .",
    "therefore , these differences are significant . for subsequent analysis",
    ", we use the median psf @xmath49-band magnitudes as listed in the variable point source catalog , which are similar to the @xmath54 values .",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for interstellar dust extinction using schlegel et al .",
    "in this section , we present the best - fit variability parameters after applying the drw model to the light curves of all variable point sources in s82 .",
    "these parameters are used to develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sources .",
    "we compare the results for two subsamples : one containing the spectroscopically confirmed quasars , and one containing all other objects ( which is dominated by stars ) .",
    "we also investigate in detail the objects in the latter subsample that have best - fit time scales greater than 100 days , which is indicative of quasar variability .",
    "figure  [ fig : lceg ] shows examples of fitted light curves .",
    "the top panel shows a spectroscopically confirmed quasar whose variability is well - fit by the model , and the middle panel shows an unknown object .",
    "the weighted average of all model light curves consistent with the data is shown , and the `` error snake '' is the @xmath56 range of those light curves about this mean .",
    "the best - fit variability parameters along with @xmath58 are listed at the bottom of the panels , where @xmath59 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "additional information on the goodness of fit is provided by the parameter @xmath60 which was used in koz10 and macleod et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to select light curves that are better described by a drw than by pure white noise . here , @xmath61 is the likelihood of the best - fit stochastic model and @xmath62 is that for a white noise solution ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in addition to having a larger @xmath64 , the light curve for the unclassified object in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : lceg ] has @xmath65 and is therefore only marginally more consistent with the drw model than with white noise . in some cases",
    "( see the bottom panel ) , outliers in the light curve cause a relatively large @xmath64 while the likelihood is high for a drw ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "outliers such as these could either represent a model failure or a bad data point with a true error that is larger than the reported value .",
    "a detailed analysis of these cases will be discussed in a future publication .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hist ] , @xmath64 is shown as a function of @xmath67 for the known quasars and all other objects in the variable s82 sample .",
    "the quasars typically have @xmath68 while all other variable s82 objects typically have @xmath69 , with a large overlap between the two distributions .",
    "the overlap is greatly reduced when considering the marginal distributions of @xmath70 . while @xmath64 barely resolves two populations ( quasars and stars ) , @xmath70 efficiently separates quasars ( which are well - fit by the stochastic model ) from variable stars ( which are better fit by pure noise ) . objects with high @xmath70 also tend to vary on longer time scales ( see figure  [ fig : taulnoise ] ) .",
    "therefore , the characteristic time scale @xmath1 also provides an efficient way to distinguish quasars from stars .",
    "the distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the quasar and stellar subsamples are shown in figure  [ fig : sftau ] . the @xmath1 distribution ( in the observer s frame ) peaks near 500 days for the known quasars and around 1 day for the other objects , providing an efficient and simple way to distinguish between the two subsamples .",
    "we note that because quasars are known to have aperiodic variability , eliminating periodic sources should lead to a cleaner sample of quasars .",
    "we could classify variable sources as periodic if the likelihood for the peak in the lomb ",

    "1992b ) being observed at random is @xmath71 and the estimated period is less than @xmath0200  days . for longer periods ,",
    "many quasars are falsely flagged as periodic because the periodogram only tests for whether a sine wave is a better fit than a constant , and this is frequently true for quasars with only a few `` oscillations '' in the data ( see koz10 ) . because we have few longer period variable stars in s82 , adding such a cut for periodic stars adds little and so we have not included it .",
    "this differs from the magellanic cloud fields examined by koz10 where there are many longer - period periodic stars ( e.g. , cepheids ) .",
    "the use of @xmath1 as an efficient classifier is further illustrated in figure  [ fig : colormap ] . the top - left panel shows the @xmath46 and @xmath47 colors for spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars .",
    "the top - right panel shows the median value of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 color .",
    "this panel shows that the quasar locus ( region ii ) as well as the high redshift quasars ( @xmath72 ; region iv ) are dominated by long time scales , while the stellar locus ( region i ) and the rr  lyrae ( region iii ) have short time scales .",
    "the time scale information is able to clearly distinguish between quasars and rr lyrae , as opposed to when using the rms of variability alone ( see figure 3 in sesar et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the quasar regions of color space also tend to have larger median values of @xmath2 , as seen in the bottom - left panel of figure  [ fig : colormap ] .",
    "the remaining panel shows the median driving amplitude of short - term variations , @xmath73 , against @xmath46 and @xmath47 color . because it is anti - correlated with @xmath1 ( see koz10 ) , the quasar regions show systematically smaller @xmath33 than the stellar regions .",

    "butler & bloom ( 2010 , hereafter b&b ) present a different approach to using the drw model to select quasars based on variability .",

    "the characteristic time scale @xmath1 will be well - constrained if the survey length is sufficiently longer than @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to evaluate the accuracy of fitted variability parameters as a function of light curve length .      as a first test",

    "therefore , as the light curve length decreases , the mean best - fit @xmath33 will not vary significantly , while the best - fit parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath165 will become biased ( see koz10 ; macleod et al .",

    "when combining the pan - starrs @xmath173 bands , @xmath5 increases to 52% , slightly lower than the 3-year lsst cadence .",
    "the lsst 10-year completeness is lower than what was found when choosing @xmath183  days in the previous section ( 86% vs.  92% ) , but it could be increased by weakening the cut on @xmath180 . however , because the contamination rate is not known for lsst , it is unclear as to how much this cut could be varied without a major decrease in @xmath3 .",
    "again , the ogle cadence leads to the highest @xmath5 due to the large number of epochs .",
    "we also find a significant decrease in @xmath5 for the s82 cadence from what is observed in the eleventh row of table  [ tab : cuts ] ( 81% vs.  96% ) .",
    "this may be due to the prescription for generating mean magnitudes .",
    "a larger @xmath5 is expected if we were to use the scaling in table  1 in b&b , because the @xmath180 would likely be larger overall ( i.e. , white noise would be less likely ) .",
    "we used the light curves for variable point sources from sdss stripe 82 to determine how well quasars can be separated from stars with the aid of photometric variability .",
    "the stripe 82 data set , designed to search for supernovae , is excellent for quasar variability studies since it provides light curves for a large statistical sample of objects to a faint limiting magnitude ( see boutsia et al .",
    "2010 for another example of using supernova surveys to search for quasars ) .",
    "the data set used here contains precise photometry ( using recalibrated light curves by ivezi et al .",
    "2007 and sesar et al .  2007 ) , as well as extensive spectroscopy , which has enabled us to develop an efficient method for selecting quasars while maintaining high completeness .",
    "the variability model used here ( a damped random walk , see kbs09 ; koz10 ) is robust enough to handle sparse or irregularly - sampled data . by modeling the variability as a stochastic process described by the exponential covariance matrix @xmath184 , only o(@xmath185 )",
    "operations are required to determine the model parameters for a light curve with @xmath185 data points .",
    "this is an important algorithmic feature in the context of upcoming massive synoptic surveys , such as lsst .",
    "the drw model provides unique information on the characteristic time scale , @xmath1 , for which a range has been observed for quasars ( sesar et al .",
    "2006 ; kbs09 ; koz10 ; macleod et al .",
    "compared to selecting solely on the short - term behavior of the @xmath186 ( the parameter @xmath33 ) , the inclusion of @xmath1 information boosts @xmath5 from 90% to 97% while maintaining an efficiency ( purity , @xmath3 ) at 80% , based on variability alone .",
    "conversely , for @xmath116% , the @xmath1 information boosts @xmath3 from about 60% to 75% , while at @xmath4% , @xmath3 rises from about 80% to 85% .",
    "this method enables the selection of @xmath187 quasars , where color selection largely fails . with the aid of @xmath15 and @xmath16 color selection",
    ", the efficiency can be further boosted to 96% with a reasonably high completeness of 93% .",
    "it is worth reiterating that the @xmath3 determined here is only a lower limit because the spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample is not 100% complete .",
    "this performance is accomplished simply by imposing a lower limit on @xmath1 and an upper limit on @xmath33 .",
    "the separation might improve when using more advanced techniques such as kernel density estimation ( e.g. , richards 2008 ) rather than imposing simple limits .    by using the parametrization @xmath20",
    ", schm10 was able to select quasars from uvx objects with @xmath188% at 90% completeness when selecting on @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this selection is similar to one using @xmath33 alone , and provides a reasonable method for selecting quasars from short ( @xmath112  year ) light curves . with longer light curves ,",
    "the inclusion of @xmath1 information significantly improves the performance .",
    "the differences in @xmath5 and @xmath3 are summarized in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : optimaltausig ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : sftausig ] .",
    "if we restrict our initial sample to uvx objects and simply use @xmath74  days to select quasars , we find that @xmath5 improves from the 90% found by schm10 to 95% , while @xmath3 improves from about 95% to 97% . when combining the selection criteria @xmath189  days and @xmath190 mag yr@xmath124 , we find that @xmath5 improves further to 98% with @xmath191 .",
    "we note that the drw model has benefits beyond the improved selection efficiency compared to schm10 .",
    "in addition to being a faster algorithm [ o(@xmath185 ) rather than o(@xmath192 ) ] , the drw model also produces information on the physics of the accretion disk since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are physical parameters that show correlations with luminosity , black hole mass , and wavelength ( see macleod et al .",
    "2010 ) and provides an approach for classifying other aperiodic sources as well ( see koz10 ) .",
    "the latter two points are also advantages of our approach over that in b&b . for quasar selection ,",
    "both methods yield similar results for completeness and efficiency .",
    "our selection criteria identify 255 objects with @xmath14 and @xmath51  ra  @xmath52 that vary on long time scales ( @xmath132  days with @xmath78 ) and do not presently have sdss spectra ; the majority of them are likely quasars .",
    "based on their light curves , several are expected to be interesting long - time scale variable objects , such as agb stars .",
    "we plan to obtain follow - up spectroscopy for these objects ( table  [ tab : targets ] ) with the goals of either confirming their quasar nature or identifying the major contaminants in quasar selection based on variability .",
    "the drw provides a complete statistical model for quasar variability .",
    "this is especially useful for evaluating the success of quasar selection in upcoming surveys , and enables us to estimate the completeness for different survey lengths , cadences , and photometric accuracy .",
    "we can not estimate @xmath3 , however , since it is dependent on an unknown makeup of the faint variable optical sky . for a typical ( simulated ) lsst cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag ( achieved at @xmath8 ) , @xmath5",
    "is expected to be 88% for a sample selection criterion of @xmath9  days . for typical variable quasars ,",
    "the best - fit distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are biased for surveys shorter than 10 years ( by about 70% and 40% , respectively , for a length of 3 years ) .",
    "however , @xmath33 is well - constrained , and with the aid of multi - band imaging , colors can be used along with a relaxed @xmath1 cut to obtain highly complete samples early in the lsst survey ( @xmath01 year ) . for the pan - starrs1  @xmath172 survey",
    ", @xmath5 is estimated to be 70% for a @xmath9  day selection after combining the @xmath173 bands , which is comparable to the result for a 3-year @xmath44-band lsst cadence",
    ". the dense cadence of the lsst will provide tighter constraints on @xmath1 for a survey length of 10 years .",
    "this improvement is also important for relating observations to the physics of accretion disks ( see macleod et al .  2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "the most important conclusion of this work is that , given an adequate survey cadence , photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection for separating quasars from stars .",
