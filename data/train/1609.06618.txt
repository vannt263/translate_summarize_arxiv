    "one of the basic problems of the theory of metric embeddings is : given some banach space or a natural class @xmath1 of banach spaces find classes of metric spaces which admit low - distortion embeddings into each banach space of the class @xmath1 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a new embedding method which can be used to show that some finite metric spaces admit low - distortion embeddings into all nonsuperreflexive spaces ( theorem  [ t : main ] ) .",
    "this method is based on the theory of equal - signs - additive sequences ( esa ) developed by brunel and sucheston @xcite .",
    "we show in theorem  [ no - diamonds - in - x - delta ] that some of the low - distortion embeddability results obtained using this method can not be obtained using the method based on the factorization between the summing basis and the unit vector basis of @xmath0 , which was used by bourgain @xcite and johnson and schechtman @xcite , see corollary [ c : usedbjs ] .",
    "the problem mentioned at the beginning of the previous paragraph can be regarded as one side of the problem of metric characterization of the class @xmath1 .",
    "recall that , in the most general sense , a _",
    "metric characterization _ of a class of banach spaces is a characterization which refers only to the metric structure of a banach space and does not involve the linear structure .",
    "the study of metric characterizations became an active research direction in mid-1980s , in the work of bourgain @xcite and bourgain , milman , and wolfson @xcite ( see also pisier @xcite ) .",
    "the work on metric characterization of isomorphic invariants of banach spaces determined by their finite - dimensional subspaces , and on generalization of the obtained theory to general metric spaces became known as the _ ribe program _",
    ", see @xcite .",
    "the type of metric characterizations which is closely related to the present paper is the following :    [ d : testspace ] let @xmath1 be a class of banach spaces and let @xmath2 be a set of metric spaces .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is a set of _ test - spaces _ for @xmath1 if the following two conditions are equivalent for a banach space @xmath4 : * ( 1 ) * @xmath5 ; * ( 2 ) * the spaces @xmath6 admit bilipschitz embeddings into @xmath4 with uniformly bounded distortions .",
    "there are several known different sets of finite test - spaces for superreflexivity of banach spaces , including : the set of all finite binary trees ( bourgain @xcite , see also @xcite ) , the set of diamond graphs , and the set of laakso graphs ( johnson and schechtman @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in @xcite it was shown that these sets of test - spaces are independent in the sense that the respective families of metric spaces do not admit bilipschitz embeddings one into another with uniformly bounded distortions .",
    "there are also metric characterizations of superreflexivity using only one metric test - space .",
    "baudier @xcite proved that the infinite binary tree is such a test - space , many other one - element test - spaces for superreflexivity were described in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a survey on metric characterizations of superreflexivity .",
    "the first main result of the present paper is a construction of bilipschitz embeddings with a uniform bound on distortions of diamond graphs with arbitrary finite number of branches into any non - superreflexive banach space .",
    "multibranching diamonds are a generalization of usual ( binary ) diamond graphs .",
    "their embedding properties were first studied in @xcite .    [",
    "d : branchdiam ] for any integer @xmath7 , we define @xmath8 to be the graph consisting of two vertices joined by one edge . for any @xmath9 ,",
    "if the graph @xmath10 is already defined , the graph @xmath11 is defined as the graph obtained from @xmath10 by replacing each edge @xmath12 in @xmath10 by a set of @xmath13 independent paths of length @xmath14 joining @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we endow @xmath11 with the shortest path distance .",
    "we call @xmath17 _ diamond graphs of branching @xmath13 _ , or _",
    "diamonds of branching _ @xmath13 .",
    "we prove    [ t : main ] for every @xmath18 , any non - superreflexive banach space @xmath4 , and any @xmath19 , @xmath7 , there exists a bilipschitz embedding of @xmath11 into @xmath4 with distortion at most @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ t : main ] implies that the set of all diamond graphs of arbitrary finite branching is a set of test - spaces for superreflexivity .    to prove theorem  [ t : main ] we develop a novel technique of constructing low - distortion embeddings of finite metric spaces into non - superreflexive banach spaces .",
    "this technique , which we consider the main contribution of the present paper , relies on the concept of equal - sign - additive ( esa ) sequences developed by brunel and sucheston @xcite in their deep study of superreflexivity .",
    "our construction relies on esa basic sequences and on , now standard , use of independent random variables , to identify in any non - superreflexive banach space an element @xmath21 with multiple well - separated ( exact ) metric midpoints between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with an additional property that the selected metric midpoints between @xmath21 and @xmath22 have a structure sufficiently similar to the element @xmath21 , so that the procedure of selecting multiple good well - separated metric midpoints can be iterated the desired number of times .",
    "the construction and the proof are presented in section  [ s : d1k ] .",
    "we have not attempted to find the best constant in theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "we do not expect that @xmath20 is the best possible constant . in section  [ s : bs ] , we briefly recall the definitions and results from @xcite that we use .",
    "it is clear that our techniques work for somewhat larger families of graphs . in particular , in section",
    "[ s : laakso ] we outline a proof of an analogue of theorem  [ t : main ] for a set of laakso graphs with arbitrary finite branching ( cf .",
    "definition  [ d : multilaakso ] and theorem  [ t : laakso ] ) .",
    "however in more general cases the technical details become much more complicated . we decided to focus our attention in this paper on the construction of low - distortion embeddings in the case of multibranching diamonds , so that the main ideas of the construction are more transparent , and because , as we explain below , this case can not be proved by using previously known methods .",
    "also , in recent years diamond graphs of high branching have appeared naturally in different contexts , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next main result of the present paper ( theorem  [ no - diamonds - in - x - delta ] ) shows that the new technique that we develop is inherently different from the known before method of constructing metric embeddings into non - superreflexive banach spaces ( bourgain @xcite and johnson - schechtman @xcite ) .",
