    "multiple coherent scattering of photons in clouds of laser - cooled atoms is also subject to spin - flip physics : the so - called coherent backscattering effect ( an interference enhancement of backscattered intensity ) is severely reduced when photons are scattered by dipole transitions with a zeeman degeneracy @xcite .",

    "compared to electrons , the theory appears much simpler because at low light intensity , photons do not interact . however , the treatment of photon propagation is more involved because the field transversality adds another source of polarisation relaxation that needs to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "thus , magnetic impurities are a very efficient source of dephasing for interference of spin - carrying particles : the large ground - state degeneracy implied by the random orientations of freely orientable impurity spins permits dephasing even at zero temperature  when other decoherence processes like electron  phonon or electron  electron scattering are suppressed  because no energy exchange is involved and stocking which - path information comes for free . in return , whenever the impurity degrees of freedom can be constrained by other means , then perfect coherence is restored .",
