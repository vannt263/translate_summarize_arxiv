    "with the rapid development of vacuum technology and micro electro mechanical systems ( mems ) as well as energy converters such as solid oxide fuel cells ( sofcs ) , considerable interests have been attached to the rarefied gas mixture flows @xcite . due to the microscopic interactions between the gas molecules from different species besides those from the same species , the gas mixture flows are more complex than the single - species gas flows .",
    "it has been shown that some special phenomena in the gas mixture flows can appear compared with the single gas flows @xcite . as one of these phenomena , the gas separation has been received much attention , and is attributed to the difference in the mean velocities of each species @xcite .    the separation phenomenon in gas mixtures is very important in many applications including pumping , sampling , filtering , etc . @xcite .",
    "for example , this kind of separation effect should be considered in predictions of the mass flow rate of mixture as well as the flow rate of gas components .",
    "early in 1949 , the separation phenomenon was reported first by present _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who studied the binary gaseous flows through a long circular capillary .",
    "they pointed out that the pressure gradient may lead to a diffusion in a mixture flows . with a finite rarefaction effect",
    ", different species of the mixtures travel with different speeds in the channel owing to their different molecular velocities , and hence the species tend to separate .",
    "moreover , it is found that the maximum separation degree depends on the molecular mass ratio . on the basis of this theory ,",
    "some researches have been further performed on the gas separation effect @xcite .",
    "higashi et al .",
    "@xcite applied a derived expression of surface diffusion coefficient to predict the degree of separation in binary gas - mixtures , and provided theoretical and experimental verifications through the separation results of the n - butane and propane mixture flows . via a detailed investigation on the separation phenomenon for binary mixture flow through a long tube into a vacuum ,",
    "sharipov et al .",
    "@xcite found that the concentration and rarefaction at the entrance of the tube have a significant effect on the concentration varying along the tube .",
    "@xcite studied the gas separation in a knudsen pump by solving the boltzmann equation and demonstrated the influence of molecular potential on the gas separation rate . by solving the linearized boltzmann equation , kalempa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also investigated the separation phenomenon and found that the flow rate of each species is influenced by both the mole fraction and rarefaction effect .",
    "szalmas et al .",
    "@xcite employed the mccormack kinetic model to simulate the flows of binary gaseous mixtures through micro - channels with triangular and trapezoidal configurations , and reported that the mass flow rate will be predicted with a 10% discrepancy when the separation effect is not considered .    from the available studies in the literature ,",
    "it is indicated to us that the molecular mass ratio and mole fraction have a significant effect on the separation in the binary gaseous flows .",
    "however , it is not clear how these internal parameters influence the separation phenomenon . in general",
    ", the separation phenomenon in gaseous mixture flows is also determined by some important external factors , such as the compression effect and rarefaction effect .",
    "therefore , a detailed investigation is highly desired for us to reveal the influence of such parameters on the gas - gas separation . as far as we know",
    ", no previous works have been reported on this subject . in this work",
    ", we will conduct a parametric study to understand how these mentioned parameters affect the separation phenomenon in binary gaseous mixtures , which can be served as a typical case for the separation effect of multicomponent gas mixture systems .    in most works on the separation phenomenon in gaseous mixtures flows ,",
    "the boltzmann equation is needed to be trivially solved . as a mesoscopic method which stems from a discrete approximation to the boltzmann equation , the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) method has been recently applied to microflows of binary mixtures owing to its simplicity and efficiency  @xcite .",
    "however , the gas separation of binary mixtures is not investigated in these works . on the other hand , as revealed in the lbe method literature @xcite , the multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) collision model has a better potential for simulating micro - gaseous binary mixtures .",
    "therefore , in this work the binary gaseous flows are simulated by the mrt - lbe model combined with the effective relaxation times and a proposed diffusive - bounce - back boundary ( dbb ) scheme .",
    "the effects of four parameters , including the pressure ratio , the knudsen ( kn ) number , the molecular mass and mole fraction , are investigated on the separation of binary gaseous flow in a microchannel .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this work , we consider the two - dimensional flow of gas mixtures in a microchannel of length @xmath0 and height @xmath1 as shown in fig .  [ channel ] .",
    "the channel connects two reservoirs which are filled with the binary mixture with different pressures and concentrations .",
    "the concentration and pressure of the mixture in the reservoirs are assumed to be constant during the flow process since the number of gas molecules flowing through the channel is negligible compared to the number of gas molecules in the reservoirs . in this work",
    "we simulate the flow in the microchannel only , and replace the reservoirs with boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the channel .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath2 in our study , meaning that the end effect at the inlet and outlet can be ignored at this ratio   @xcite .",
    "in general , the flow described above is influenced by a number of parameters . in this study , we mainly consider the pressure ratio , knudsen number , molecular mass ratio , and mole fraction of each species .",

    "boundary conditions play an important role in the lbe method for microscale gas flows  @xcite .",

    "concretely speaking , at the inlet ( @xmath131 ) , the unknown distribution functions and density are obtained by extrapolation from the inner nodes @xmath132 where 0 , 1 , and 2 denote the nodes at the inlet , first layer , and second layer , respectively . the density",

    "the distribution functions and densities at the outlet can be obtained in a similar way .      in order to verify the proposed dbb scheme ,",
    "the mrt - lbe together with the dbb and bsr boundary conditions are tested by simulations of case 2 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 . in all of the following simulations , the relaxation times are set as follows : @xmath51 is determined by eq .",

    "[ eop ] where the results obtained by the mccormack kinetic method @xcite are included for comparison .     along the channel for case 2 at @xmath142 and @xmath136 .",
    "symbols : the results obtained by the mccormack kinetic method @xcite ; solid lines : the present mrt - lbe results.,scaledwidth=66.0% ]    as can be seen , the numerical outcome from the present mrt - lbe model coincides excellently with that from the mccormack kinetic method .",
    "all of these favorable comparisons lend confidence in the accuracy of the mrt - lbe model together with the proposed dbb boundary conditions .",
    "in this section , the present mrt - lbe model together with the proposed dbb boundary condition are applied to the he / ar and ne / ar gas mixtures at the cases listed in table [ c3table1 ] .",
    "a parametric study will be performed to investigate the gas separation phenomenon affected by the pressure ratio , the knudsen number and molecular mass and mole fraction . as an indicative parameter for the gas separation",
    ", the mole fraction in the binary mixture will be mainly considered in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we first focus on the effect of pressure ratio on the separation process . as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ eop ] , the mole fraction of the light species @xmath143 is non - uniform along the channel , which decreases from the inlet first and then increases to the value at the outlet .",
    "this means that a local minimum exists in the distribution of @xmath144 at certain point in the channel .",
    "consequently , via this minimum value and eq . , the parameters @xmath24 can be obtained to reflect the degree of separation .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we can see from both subfigures that the mole fraction distribution along the channel is nonlinear , which is similar to the results found by kalempaa and sharipov @xcite . through comparisons of mole fraction at different knudsen numbers in one binary mixture as well as at the same knudsen number but in different binary mixtures , it can be found that the increase of knudsen number and molecular mass ratio can lead to the gas separation phenomenon easier , which is consistent with the foregoing results .",
    "particularly , when careful attention is paid to the mole fraction @xmath144 near the inlet in fig . [ eom2 ] ( a ) and the outlet in fig .",
    "[ eom2 ] ( b ) , it is found that @xmath144 in these regions varies much faster than in other places of the channel , which can actually be deduced from the convexity ( fig .",
    "[ eom2 ] ( a ) ) and concavity ( fig .",
    "[ eom2 ] ( b ) ) properties of @xmath144 as well .",
    "this indicates the appearance of the separation phenomenon , and more importantly , this leads us to an interesting result that the gas separation takes place mainly in the region near the channel end with higher mole fraction .",
    "it is noteworthy that this finding has not been reported in previous studies .",
    "in this paper , the separation phenomenon of a binary gaseous mixture is investigated by the mrt - lbe method with a proposed kinetic boundary condition combining the bounce - back and the discrete maxwell s diffuse schemes .",
    "the wall - confinement effects are considered in the effective relaxation times to simulate microscale flows in both slip and transition regimes .",
    "it is seen that the mole fraction of each component in the gas mixtures does not distribute uniformly along a microchannel . at an equal mole fraction given at the channel ends",
    ", there will be a minimum mole fraction for the lighter species in the channel .",
    "for the separation process , the effects of pressure ratio , rarefaction , mole fraction and molecular mass ratio are studied in detail .",
    "it is found that the degree and rate of gas separation are influenced by these parameters , and the main results are summarized as follows :    first , the separation process is fierce as the pressure ratio decreases .",
    "this is because a smaller pressure ratio enhances the rarefaction , which leads to a decrease in the momentum transfer between the light and heavy molecules and further increases the difference in species velocities .",
    "second , the separation phenomenon is enhanced when the knudsen number becomes larger in that the resulted larger rarefaction effect increases the difference in species velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "the separation rate decreases slightly with increasing the knudsen number due to the reduced molecular velocity .",
    "finally , the separation process is more obvious for a mixture with large molecular mass ratio as expected , and the degree and rate of separation increase as the mole fraction of the light species decreases .",
    "particularly and interestingly , the channel end with higher mole fraction of lighter species is the main region where the gas separation takes place .",
    "the present work on the gas separation phenomenon is limited to the two dimension case , which is inadequate to reveal the fundamental knowledge . in the future",
    ", we will extend this work to three dimensional cases , and a detailed parametric study on the gas separation will be followed .",
