    "the dynamics of a resonator coupled to a superconducting single - electron transistor ( sset ) is rather rich with a range of different behaviors expected to occur .",
    "recent experiments in which the resonator was formed by a nanomechanical beam demonstrated ultra - sensitive displacement detection and cooling of the mechanical motion  @xcite . in another experiment  @xcite",
    "the resonator was formed by a superconducting stripline and the sset was used to drive it into a laser - like state  @xcite of self - sustained oscillation .",
    "a sset consists of a superconducting island which is connected to two superconducting leads via tunnel junctions and capacitively coupled to a gate electrode , as shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : jqp ] .",
    "the gate electrode forms part of the resonator , either as a metal wire deposited on top of a nanomechanical beam@xcite or by forming the central electrode of a superconducting stripline@xcite .",
    "depending on the gate and bias voltages applied , the sset can support a wide variety of current carrying processes  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a particular current resonance , the josephson quasiparticle ( jqp ) cycle  @xcite . at the jqp resonance",
    "current flows via a combination of the coherent tunneling of a cooper pair at one of the junctions followed by the successive tunneling of two quasiparticles across the other junction .",
    "the center of the resonance occurs when the electrostatic energy of the two states linked by cooper pair tunneling is the same .",
    "when the sset is biased away from the center of the resonance the charges flowing through the sset can either absorb energy from the resonator  @xcite or emit energy into it  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the charge dynamics in the jqp cycle is closely related to that of another mesoscopic conductor namely a double quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime and so - called wide bias limit@xcite .",
    "when the sset is detuned from resonance in such a way as to emit energy into the resonator the latter is effectively pumped by the flow of charges . for sufficiently strong coupling",
    "the resonator can be driven into a state of self - sustained oscillation .",
    "useful analogies can be made between the sset - resonator system and quantum optical systems such as the laser@xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a number of similarities between the predicted dynamics of a resonator driven by a sset and a micromaser . in a micromaser@xcite",
    "a superconducting cavity interacts with a stream of two - level atoms which pass through it one at a time .",

    "the resonator interacts with only one pair of charges moving through the sset island at any one time , but the sset current is not independent of the resonator dynamics .",

    "similarly , the sset current provides a natural source of information about the dynamics of the resonator@xcite .",
    "however , as with many mesoscopic systems@xcite , the fluctuations in the current contain much more information about the dynamics of the system than the average current alone .",
    "a number of recent studies@xcite have shown how the current noise of a nanoelectromechanical system can be used to infer quite a lot about the dynamics of the system .",
    "for example , it has been recognized that a bistability in the dynamics of the mechanical resonator can lead to an extremely large peak in the current noise@xcite . in the case of the sset - resonator system",
    "it has already been shown that the onset of self - sustained oscillations in the resonator can be associated with strong features in the sset current noise@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic study of the current characteristics of a sset when it is coupled to a resonator as a function of the sset - resonator coupling strength , the choice of sset bias point and the frequency of the resonator .",
    "in particular , we use a numerical approach based on the master equation to explore the relation between the resonator s state ( measured by the average resonator energy and associated variance ) and the sset current and zero - frequency current noise . for sufficiently strong coupling",
    ", strong correlations develop between fluctuations in the resonator energy and the current noise .",
    "this means that measurements of the current noise could provide a very useful probe of the resonator dynamics .",
    "in addition to the full numerical calculations , we also use a series of simpler approximate methods to gain more insight into the coupled dynamics of the system .",
    "when the sset - resonator coupling is sufficiently weak , the sset acts on the resonator like an effective thermal bath . in this regime",
    "we use a mean field approach that allows us to include information about the resonator dynamics as well as the correlations between the sset and the resonator progressively and hence discover how these affect the current noise without influencing the average current . in the strong coupling regime , where the resonator undergoes oscillations driven by the current , we use an eigenfunction expansion of the liouville operator in the master equation@xcite to understand the current noise . in the vicinity of a bistability the current noise is dominated by the slow switching of the system between the two effective states of the system which is manifested by one eigenvalue for the liouvillian which is much smaller ( in magnitude ) than all the others@xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find elsewhere that the noise can also be approximated quite well using a single term in the eigenfunction expansion even when a wide separation between the smallest few eigenvalues does not exist .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : maseq ] we introduce the master equation we use to model the sset resonator system .",
    "we also describe how the steady state properties of the resonator and the current noise can be calculated numerically . then in sec .",

    "[ sec : unstab ] we consider the regime where the coupling is strong enough to drive the resonator into limit cycle states .",

    "the final term represents the linear coupling of the resonator to the charge on the sset island .",
    "the length scale @xmath13 is the shift in the resonator position due to the addition of a single electronic charge to the island .",
    "the coupling strength is conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the drain source voltage and @xmath16 the electron charge . note that here we use the language and notation appropriate for a nanomechanical resonator , but the hamiltonian takes essentially the same form for a superconducting stripline resonator@xcite .",

    "the problem of finding the steady state density matrix is reduced to finding the right hand eigenvector of @xmath25 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath35 . by truncating the oscillator basis , eq .",

    "details of the numerical method and the approximations made are contained in appendix  [ sec : nummeth ] .",
    "our aim in this paper is to understand to what extent information about the dynamical state of the resonator becomes imprinted on the transport properties of the sset .",
    "as well as calculating the current we also consider the zero frequency current noise , which is independent of the junction at which it is measured . we choose to calculate the noise at the junction at which the cooper pair tunneling takes place ( the left hand junction ) as the current operator here is composed of system operators alone , which along with the markovian nature of the master equation , allows the use of the quantum regression theorem  @xcite .",

    "in this section we give a survey of the current and noise characteristics of the sset and the corresponding resonator dynamics calculated numerically over a range of different parameters . in later sections we will provide a more detailed analysis of the most interesting regimes .",
    "the sset - resonator system is rather complex , even within the framework of the simple model we are using here . in particular , the behavior of the system depends on a rather large number of different parameters . some of the system parameters such as the detuning @xmath7 and the sset - resonator coupling @xmath55 can be changed during a particular experiment , while many of the other system parameters can be tuned by appropriate design of the device , including the frequency of the resonator which can be in the region of @xmath56mhz for a mechanical device@xcite or of order @xmath56ghz for a superconducting stripline resonator@xcite .",
    "we have not attempted a systematic survey of all feasible parameter regimes , but instead focus primarily on the effects of changing @xmath7 , @xmath55 and the resonator frequency .",

    "the current , @xmath58 , and fano factor , @xmath59 , for a sset tuned to the jqp resonance are given by  @xcite : @xmath60 the current has a peak at the center of the resonance @xmath61 , which has a width determined by @xmath19 and @xmath8 .",
    "far from resonance the current fano factor has a value of 2 .",
    "this is because the rate at which the cooper pairs tunnel onto the island is much slower than the quasiparticle decay rate and hence when a cooper pair reaches the island it swiftly breaks up into quasiparticles .",
    "the two quasiparticle tunneling processes occur in quick succession@xcite ( compared to the rate of cooper pair tunneling ) and hence the charge is effectively transferred in units of 2@xmath16 .",
    "however , close to the center of the resonance in the regime where @xmath62 ( which we study here ) there is a strong interplay between the coherent transfer of cooper pairs and the quasiparticle tunneling which results in a suppression of the noise .",
    "this suppression is strongest at the center of the resonance where the coherent motion of cooper pairs is most important .",
    "coupling a resonator to the sset can significantly modify the behavior of the two individual systems .",
    "in particular , energy can be transferred between the sset charges and the resonator . for low to moderate",
    "coupling the resonator reaches one of three types of steady - state@xcite : a state in which the resonator fluctuates about a fixed point , a limit - cycle state where the resonator undergoes self - sustained oscillations and a ` bistable ' state , where the two coexist . at larger couplings other states",

    "however , for @xmath80 when @xmath7 is sufficiently negative ( @xmath81 ) the resonator enters the bistable regime and then undergoes a transition back to the fixed point state in which the limit cycle disappears abruptly@xcite .",
    "the corresponding behavior of the current is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i_varkap ] .",
    "although the current is clearly modified by the coupling to the resonator , it does not contain any clear signatures of the transitions in the resonator state .",
    "an important measure of the resonator state is the fano factor of the resonator occupation number , defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( where here @xmath84 is the number operator @xmath85 ) .",
    "@xmath86 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fn_varkap ] . unlike the average energy of the resonator , @xmath86 is strongly peaked around the transitions between the fixed point and",

    "the current fano factor @xmath87 is plotted in fig .  [ fig : f0_varkap ] . the behavior is rather complex , especially for relatively weak couplings , but overall it is clear that the current noise is a much better indicator of the presence of transitions in the resonator state than @xmath88 .",
    "the behavior is simplest for larger @xmath55 , well within the regime where the dynamical transitions occur and in this region we see well defined peaks in the noise at the transitions into and out of the fixed point state .",
    "the noise peak is particularly prominent in the case of the bistability .",
    "although we have defined the bistable state on the basis of just the number of peaks in the @xmath65 distribution , rather than the coexistence of two well separated states it is certainly possible to find regimes where a true bistability in this sense exists ( i.e.  where the @xmath65 distribution not only has two peaks , but also has very small values for at least some range of the @xmath84 values between the peaks ) . for a well defined bistability the current noise can become extremely large , a phenomenon which has been shown to be due to the existence of a very slow timescale associated with the switching of the system between the metastable states of the system  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to consider the opposite regime of a fast resonator , @xmath89 . in this regime the coherent coupling between the resonator and the sset",
    "is expected to give rise to well - defined features when the resonator frequency matches an eigenenergy of the sset , @xmath90 with @xmath91 an integer ( for the relatively strong quasiparticle decay rates considered here @xmath89 means that @xmath92 ) .",
    "numerically we do indeed find that limit cycles occur at these resonance points , almost always via continuous transitions , with the higher order features ( @xmath93 ) appearing at progressively larger couplings .",
    "figure  [ fig : f0_varkap_highom ] shows @xmath88 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 around the @xmath94 ( one photon absorption ) peak corresponding to @xmath95 with the dashed line marking the onset of the limit cycle state .",
    "this resonance was recently observed in experiments using a superconducting resonator  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the peak in the current correlates well with the presence of the limit cycle , but this peak is present at the resonance even when the limit cycle is not formed , albeit with a very small size .",
    "however , the behavior of the noise shows a clear signature of the onset of the limit cycle with a distinctive peak structure forming along the transition lines for both @xmath87 and @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f0_varkap_highom]b and c ) . within the limit cycle regime",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath86 show dips the size of which is an indication of how well defined the limit cycle is .    in practice",
    "it is also possible to build devices where the resistance of the junction where quasiparticle tunneling occurs is much larger than the quantum of resistance@xcite ( i.e. @xmath96 ) .",
    "increasing the resistance of the junction where quasiparticle tunneling occurs enhances the coherent interaction between the cooper pairs and the resonator . strictly speaking one would expect other effects which give rise to dephasing of the sset charge ( beyond just quasiparticle tunneling ) to become relevant in this regime",
    "nevertheless , for our simple model we find that when @xmath96 and @xmath89 , the current noise at @xmath97 can become sub - poissonian ( @xmath98 ) and the resonator fano factor can also drop below unity , indicating a non - classical resonator state .",
