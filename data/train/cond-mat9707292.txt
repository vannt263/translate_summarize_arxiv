    "modern techniques allow the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures incorporating a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and a lateral periodic electrostatic potential ( electric modulation ) and/or a periodic magnetic field ( magnetic modulation ) . in the presence of an external , constant , and perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", the modulation lifts the degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "the resulting landau - band structure determines various oscillations of the magnetoresistivities , which usually provide with the only accessible information on the modulation strength .",
    "there are at least three types of modulation effects on the magnetoresistivities .",
    "first , the weiss commensurability oscillations in the quasi - classical regime of low magnetic fields , both for the electric , @xcite and , more recently for the magnetic modulations,@xcite have attracted most of the experimental and theoretical work.@xcite second , the peculiar subband structure generated by a two - dimensional superlattice , known as the hofstadter butterfly , leads to another type of commensurability oscillations , inside the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) peaks , their observation being currently the aim of important efforts.@xcite and third , at high magnetic fields , the profile of the density of states ( dos ) associated to the energy dispersion of the landau bands , together with the exchange - enhanced spin splitting , may also determine an internal structure of the sdh maxima .",
    "in the present paper we will discuss only this last type of effects .",
    "the experimental results have been obtained for the resistivity @xmath0 of gaas - algaas interfaces with an electric modulation in the @xmath1 direction , i.e. of a one - dimensional character .",
    "the first investigation was performed on a modulation created by holographic illumination.@xcite in the absence of the modulation the spin splitting of the second landau level , with @xmath2 , could not be resolved in the magnetoresistivity , but with increasing the modulation amplitude , the evolution of a double - peak structure was observed , and it was attributed to the van hove singularities ( vhs ) of the dos .    further experiments , on higher mobility samples modulated by etching techniques , have clearly shown the spin splitting . for a weak modulation",
    "again a double - peak , but also a more complicated triple - peak structure have been detected in the spin - polarized sdh maxima of @xmath0 corresponding to the band @xmath2.@xcite for a stronger modulation the spin splitting vanishes , but the magnetoresistivity _ minima _ at low even filling factors change into _ maxima _ at higher even filling factors , simultaneously with the shift of the minima towards the odd filling factors.@xcite this behavior has convincingly been explained by the cumulated effects of the overlapping vhs from adjacent landau bands . in the experiments",
    "mentioned so far the modulation period has been in the range of 300 - 500 nm , and much larger than the magnetic length .",
    "another series of recent measurements has been performed on modulated systems produced by growing on vicinal surfaces.@xcite this technique generates an electric modulation of a much shorter period , about 30 nm . the resistivity @xmath0 also displays a multi - peak structure which may be related to the vhs .",
    "the anisotropy of the resistivity , as well as an abrupt onset of the spin splitting for a high magnetic field , have been clearly evidenced.@xcite    in all these experiments a detailed interpretation of the results is difficult , and still insufficiently clear . beyond the technological constrictions , the difficulties arise from the complicated relationship between the dos and the magnetoresistivities , and from the non - negligible electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "therefore , a transport calculation combining on the same footing the electron - modulation , electron - electron and the electron - impurity interactions , and also thermal effects , is needed .",
    "the anisotropy of the modulation may result in a high anisotropy of the conductivity tensor .",
    "the conductivity @xmath3 has a scattering component ( inter landau level ) , which depends quadratically on the dos and _ vanishes _ in the absence of the impurities .",
    "the conductivity @xmath4 has an additional band component ( intra landau level ) , determined by the dispersion of the one - particle energies , which _ diverges _ for weak electron - impurity collision broadening.@xcite therefore , in a high mobility system , the band conductivity may cover the dos effects in @xmath4 and in the related resistivity @xmath0.@xcite    the coulomb interaction also yields opposite effects .",
    "the tendency of the electrostatic screening is to reduce the energy dispersion imposed by the modulation on the effective single - particle states , and hence to _ increase _ the dos . at the same time",
    ", the exchange interaction lowers the energy of the occupied states , enhances the energy gaps , but also broadens the landau bands , _ decreasing _ the dos .",
    "we have recently calculated the energy spectra@xcite and the resistivity tensor@xcite for a modulated system , in the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) , and we could explain the spin splitting observed in the magnetotransport experiments .",
    "however , other exchange effects have been overestimated in the standard hfa .",
    "the main artifact in the hfa results has been the appearance of strong short - range charge - density oscillations in the presence of a weak external modulation of period much longer than the magnetic length , for any filling factor .",
    "the reason is the competition of the hartree interaction , of a repulsive character , with the fock interaction , of an attractive character , which in the presence of the modulation may excite high charge - density harmonics.@xcite this is reminiscent of the fact that the hfa predicts an instability of the homogeneous 2deg against the formation of a charge density wave for any filling factor,@xcite whereas experiments indicate an inhomogeneous ground state ( wigner crystal ) only for very low filling factors .",
    "another consequence of the strong exchange energy is a strong exchange broadening of the landau levels .",
    "a related implication is a substantial , qualitative contradiction between the hfa and the results of the hartree@xcite or thomas - fermi calculations@xcite of edge states . while the latter predict compressible edge strips much wider than the magnetic length , but only the bare spin splitting ( which is negligible for gaas ) , the hfa gives considerably narrower compressible edge channels , but a strong splitting.@xcite however , the experimental confirmation of wide edge channels@xcite suggests the domination of the electrostatic effects .    in order to avoid , or at least to minimize , these artificial features of the hfa , our previous attempt to include",
    "the coulomb interaction in a magnetotransport calculation for a modulated systems has been limited to short modulation periods.@xcite the steepness of the energy dispersion , on the magnetic length scale , can reduce the relative importance of the exchange interaction , such that the hfa may become qualitatively reasonable .    in the present paper",
    "we want to extend our calculations to the situation when the modulation period is much longer than the magnetic length .",
    "therefore our efforts will be mainly focussed on the electron - electron interaction .",
    "some preliminary results have already been reported.@xcite our approach is based on a screened hfa ( shfa ) , in which we include the influence of screening on the exchange interaction .",
    "although we consider only static screening , this leads already to the desired reduction of the exchange effects and avoids the artifacts of the bare hfa .",
    "the screening is mainly determined by the dos at the fermi level.@xcite therefore , when the latter will be in an energy gap , the screening will be weak , such that the exchange enhancement of the zeeman splitting will remain essentially like in the hfa .",
    "however , when the fermi level will intersect a landau band , the exchange effects will substantially diminish .",
    "the coulomb interaction is included in a transport calculation , within the standard kubo formalism .",
    "for this purpose we need to consider an electron - impurity scattering mechanism",
    ". we will describe it within a self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",
    "the realization of a magnetic modulation with a period of a few hundred nanometers , and a large amplitude , of the order of 1 t is technically feasible.@xcite in the presence of a constant external magnetic field such a modulation will produce landau bands and a charge - density response .",
    "hence , screening and exchange effects will occur , as for an electric modulation . even in the absence of relevant magetotransport measurements",
    ", we will include in our calculation such a periodic magnetic field .",
    "for simplicity we will discuss only the case when the modulation , electric or magnetic , is unidirectional and sinusoidal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we derive the self - consistent equations of the shfa which give us the ground state of the system .",
    "then , in sec.iii , we discuss the impurity scattering and the conductivity tensor .",
    "the numerical results of the transport calculation are presented in sec.iv , and the conclusions are collected in sec.v .",
    "some technical details are given in two appendices .",
    "we combine the influence of the electron - electron and of the electron - impurity interactions on the single - particle states of the modulated 2deg with the help of the average green function , having the operatorial definition @xmath5 with the following notations : @xmath6 stands for the average over all the impurity configurations ; @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a generic one - body hamiltonian of the interacting 2deg with impurities ; @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the noninteracting 2deg without impurities ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the self - energy operators determined by the electron - electron and electron - impurity interactions respectively .    in our case",
    "the noninteracting hamiltonian has the form @xmath12 the electrons are located in the plane @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the projection of the magnetic field along the @xmath15 axis and it may have a periodic component , @xmath16 , similar to the periodic electrostatic potential , @xmath17 .",
    "we choose the vector potential in the landau gauge , as imposed by the symmetry of our system , @xmath18 we have also included in @xmath9 the zeeman term , where @xmath19 for spin - up and @xmath20 for spin - down states , @xmath21 is the bare , band structure g - factor , and @xmath22 the bohr magneton .",
    "we use the eigenfunctions of @xmath9 corresponding to the unmodulated system , i.e. for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as the basis for the one - particle hilbert space .",
    "these functions are the well - known landau wave functions , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the one - dimensional harmonic - oscillator wave functions , with @xmath27 , centered at the position @xmath28 , called the center coordinate . here",
    "@xmath29 is the magnetic length , and we will denote by @xmath30 the cyclotron frequency , both corresponding to the _ uniform _ component of the magnetic field @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in order to simplify the notations we keep the same symbol for the two - variable wave function which depends on both spatial coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath34 , e. g. @xmath35 , and for the reduced wave function depending only on @xmath1 , @xmath26 .",
    "the distinction will be made by the number of variables specified inside the brackets .",
    "the plane - wave factor has been normalized to the macroscopic length @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath9 are given in the appendix a.    we will assume randomly distributed impurities , such that the modulated system is invariant to translations along the @xmath34 axis .",
    "consequently , the dependence on @xmath34 of the interacting , effective , one - particle wave functions , also factorizes in a simple plane wave . for these wave functions we use the notation @xmath37 , and we expand them in the landau basis , @xmath38 for the interacting , unmodulated system , we have @xmath39 , and the dependence on the spin label arises as long as the exchange interaction and an external modulation are simultaneously present .",
    "the periodic fields broaden the degenerate landau levels @xmath40 into energy bands , @xmath41 , which we find by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath42    the averaged effect of the impurities consists in the spreading of the effective single - particle energies around the energy spectrum given by eq.([scheq ] ) , and thus in an additional energy broadening .",

    "for calculating the electron - electron self - energy we start with the form given by the hfa.@xcite in the landau basis the matrix elements @xmath53 do not mix the spin and the center - coordinate quantum numbers , and can be written as @xmath54\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\equiv\\sigma^{ee , h}_{nn'}(x_0)+\\sigma^{ee , f}_{nn'}(\\sigma , x_0)\\ , , \\label{hfa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the coulomb potential with @xmath56 the dielectric constant of the semiconductor background .",
    "the two terms in the square brackets of eq.([hfa ] ) define the hartree ( direct ) and the fock ( exchange ) contributions , indicated by the superscripts @xmath8 and @xmath57 . the hartree term can be rewritten in terms of the particle density , @xmath58 the last form being the fourier expansion appropriate to our external fields .",
    "the fourier coefficients of the hartree self - energy are given in appendix a.    using eq.([effwf ] ) and the fourier transform of the coulomb potential , @xmath59 , the fock self - energy becomes @xmath60 the fourier expansion of @xmath61 is also given in appendix a.    in order to overcome the artifacts of the hfa mentioned in the introduction , we screen the coulomb potential in the exchange self - energy , substituting @xmath62 in eq.([fter ] ) by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the _ static _ dielectric function .",
    "we thus neglect the dynamic screening effects . in the spirit of the random - phase approximation ,",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 being the dielectric susceptibility given by the well - known lindhard formula,@xcite to be evaluated self - consistently with the effective states resulting from eq.([scheq ] ) . in the diagrammatic picture , fig.1 , that means the series of the polarization loops  previously contained only in the hartree part of @xmath10  is now included , via eq.([scrint ] ) , also in the fock part .    for a two - dimensional system in a perpendicular magnetic field one can identify two components of the static dielectric susceptibility , @xmath67 corresponding to the _",

    "we expect that this approximation is appropriate for weakly modulated systems characterized by @xmath73 , or @xmath74 . within the same procedure",
    "we evaluate @xmath75 as @xcite @xmath76 ^ 2   \\sum_{\\sigma } \\int_0^a\\frac{dx_0}{a }   \\frac{\\nu_{n\\sigma x_0}-\\nu_{n'\\sigma x_0 } } { e_{n\\sigma x_0}-e_{n'\\sigma x_0 } } \\ , .",
    "\\label{chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a sufficiently high magnetic field @xmath31 , that is for sufficiently large energy gaps @xmath77 , and for a small @xmath78 , @xmath70 is typically negligible with respect to @xmath68 , except eventually when there are very few states at the fermi level such that @xmath68 is vanishingly small . since for our weak modulations , in the limit @xmath79",
    ", @xmath68 becomes proportional to the thermodynamic dos , i.e. @xmath80 , we can say the screening of the exchange interaction is dominated by the intra - landau level transitions , which at low temperatures are determined by the dos at the fermi level .",
    "this screened hartree - fock approximation ( shfa ) has been used in the papers by ando , ohkawa and uemura for explaining the exchange enhancement of the zeeman @xcite and of the valley splitting @xcite in homogeneous si mos systems .",
    "further improvements have incorporated the dynamic screening , within the plasmon - pole approximation , and the coulomb - hole correlation effects , for the calculation of the photoluminescence energy in n - doped gaas quantum wells @xcite . nevertheless , in order to keep the consistent treatment of groundstate and transport properties tractable , we will neglect such additional corrections in the study of the modulated systems .",
    "in particular , even without dynamic screening effects , our results for the self - energy for a homogeneous 2deg in a gaas - algaas interface are qualitatively similar to those shown in refs .",
    "33 and 34 . in fig.2",
    "we compare the first five spin splitted landau levels vs. magnetic field , i. e. the landau fan , in the standard ( bare ) hfa with the results given by the shfa .",
    "the material parameters are @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and the carrier concentration is chosen such that @xmath84 t , @xmath46 being the filling factor .",
    "both the landau and the spin gaps are enhanced by the exchange interaction , but in the shfa the fock self - energy is strongly dependent on the dos at the fermi level , @xmath85 . thus the exchange interaction is screened for a high @xmath85 , i.e. for noninteger filling factors , but it may become very large for an integer filling .",
    "since the exchange interaction is negative , the screening mechanism leads to the deep cusps in fig.2(b ) , also present in the dynamic - screening calculations.@xcite like in the hfa , the largest energy gaps occur for integer filling factors .",
    "the thermal energy is much smaller than the energy gaps , and no disorder broadening is assumed .",
    "therefore the gaps at integer filling factors in fig.2(b ) are smaller than those in fig.2(a ) only because of the screening involved by the response of the wave functions , described by @xmath75 .",
    "we believe that the energy spectra , which we obtained within the shfa for the modulated system , are much improved with respect to those in the hfa . in fig.3(a ) we show the shfa of the landau bands generated by an electric modulation of a period much larger than the magnetic length .",
    "the zeeman splitting is enhanced in the states around the fermi energy , with replica in each of the upper and lower landau bands , as in the hfa.@xcite the improvement consists in the recovering of the pinning effect , resulting from electrostatic screening,@xcite on the spin - splitted energy bands near the fermi level .",
    "the pinning effect defines both compressible ( dispersionless ) and spin polarized strips . in the hfa , for the modulation parameters of fig.3(a )",
    ", strong short - range oscillations of the effective energies and of the charge density , with typical periods of @xmath86 , would occur .",
    "those oscillations would disappear only if the energy dispersion imposed by the external modulation would dominate the interaction effects , i.e. for a sufficiently short modulation period and/or for a sufficiently large modulation amplitude.@xcite in sufficiently strong modulaton or steep confinement potentials the exchange enhancement of spin splitting is suppressed .",
    "with decreasing slope of the potential , the enhancement recovers suddenly , and a large spin splitting of the landau bands occurs nearly symmetrically with respect to the fermi energy in such a manner , that both spin polarized bands penetrate the fermi energy with large slopes .",
    "thus , the compressible strips obtained in the hartree approximation are destroyed in the bare hfa and replaced with spin polarized incompressible strips .",
    "this spin polarization of the edge states may occur spontaneously even if the bare @xmath21-factor vanishes , and has been discussed as a type of phase transition.@xcite we believe that the occurrence of this spontaneous spin polarization is an artifact of the unscreened hfa , since our shfa yields ( as long as @xmath87 ) only a very smooth and gradual reduction of the spin splitting with increasing modulation strength , with compressible spin polarized strips ( energies pinned to the fermi energy ) instead of incompressible ones .    in fig.3(b )",
    "we transpose the results shown in fig.3(a ) for a magnetic modulation . in this case",
    "the hartree ( direct ) screening is weaker , due to the weaker , purely quantum - mechanically , coupling of the charge density to the nonuniform magnetic field , and consequently the pinning effect is less pronounced in fig.3(b ) .",
    "the peculiar hartree response to a nonuniform magnetic field , which becomes negligible in the classical limit ( cyclotron radius at the fermi energy larger than the modulation period ) will be discussed in detail elsewhere.@xcite in the present paper we restrict ourselves to a strong uniform component , @xmath31 , such that the electrostatic and the exchange effects due to the periodic component are similar to those due to the electric modulation .",
    "in order to calculate conductivities we have to consider the electron - impurity interaction . for randomly distributed impurities , the self - energy @xmath11 is diagonal with respect to @xmath28 , and obviously also with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the effects due to the electron - electron interaction , we simplify the calculation of @xmath11 by employing the phenomenological ansatz in which one ignores the dependence of its matrix elements on the landau quantum number @xmath89 and on the center coordinate @xmath28 , that is @xmath90 . in the scba , fig.1 , we need to solve the equation@xcite @xmath91    we also take a simple parametrization of the electron - impurity interaction energy , @xmath92}}$ ] [ mev ] . using eq.([scba ] )",
    "the dos can be written in the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the dos per spin level for the homogeneous system without magnetic field .",

    "then , making use of the formal relation @xmath109/2\\pi i$ ] , we find that in the static limit , @xmath110 , we have to average combinations like @xmath111 .",

    "but we see that the coulombian vertex correction is automatically included in eq.([vcor ] ) via the exchange current .",
    "the hall conductivity can now be written as@xcite @xmath114 since we treat the disorder in the scba , we can not consider localization effects , and hence we can not expect real hall plateaus . moreover , if the disorder broadening of the landau levels is much smaller than the energy bands , eq.([chall ] ) can be well approximated by the limit of a vanishing electron - impurity interaction , @xmath115 . in this limit @xmath116",
    "takes the more familiar form @xmath117 in which the energy gaps are explicitly evidenced .",
    "it is instructive to mention that neglecting the exchange current one obtains deviations from the well known quantized values , @xmath118 , for an integer filling factor .",
    "let us consider the simplest case , with no external modulation . in the absence of the coulomb interaction the energy gaps",
    "are determined by the cyclotron energy .",
    "the cyclotron frequency squared , in the denominator of eq.([chall0 ] ) , is compensated by the cyclotron frequencies introduced in the numerator by the velocity matrix elements , eq.([vit0 ] ) , and for a sufficiently low temperature one obtains the simple drude formula , @xmath119 .",
    "when the coulomb interaction is present , the energy gaps are enhanced , but a similar enhancement occurs in the numerator , determined by the exchange term of the velocities , eqs.([vex ] ) and ( [ vitex ] ) , and the drude formula remains valid .",
    "obviously , when the exchange interaction is screened the exchange currents may be small . in our calculations , for the modulated systems , their contribution to the conductivities have been of the order 30 - 50  % in the hfa,@xcite but of no more than 10 % in the present shfa .",
    "the longitudinal conductivities can be transformed from eqs.([kubo2])-([lambda ] ) to @xmath120    the relation between the longitudinal conductivities and the dos is complicated .",
    "both the diagonal conductivities @xmath3 and @xmath4 have inter - level components , corresponding to @xmath121 in eq.([clong ] ) , also known as _ scattering _ conductivities . one can show , by inspecting eq.([clong ] ) , that for a weak disorder , @xmath115 , the scattering conductivities become proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "hence , they qualitatively reproduce the dos profile , with van hove singularities corresponding to the edges of the one - dimensional landau bands .    due to the anisotropy of the system , an intra - level component of eq.([clong ] ) , with @xmath123 , is nonzero for @xmath4 only .",
    "it is called _ band _ conductivity,@xcite being directly related to the dispersion of the landau bands which yields equilibrium hall currents .",
    "if the hamiltonian is a local operator , the hellman - feynman theorem leads to @xmath124 which is no longer valid when the exchange interaction is considered .",
    "however , if the latter is screened , the deviations from eq.([feyhel ] ) are not very important , and the band conductivity can still be understood in terms of the energy dispersion .",
    "classically , it corresponds to the quasi - free drift of the centers of the cyclotron orbits along the @xmath34 axis , parallel to the periodic electric field .",
    "thus the band conductivity behaves contrary to the scattering components : it vanishes at the band edges , has maxima at the band centers , and _ diverges _ for a small disorder , like @xmath125 , becoming the dominant contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of the longitudinal conductivities , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , for an isolated , sinusoidal landau band are qualitatively displayed in fig.4 . in our calculations",
    "the two scattering conductivities are nearly equal . in fig.4(a ) we assume a small band conductivity , such that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 show the two van hove peaks . reducing the disorder broadening the scattering components decrease , but at the same time the band conductivity increases , and a triple - peak structure evolves in @xmath4 , fig.4(b ) , while the shape of @xmath3 remains unchanged . for an even smaller disorder @xmath4",
    "becomes dominated by the band conductivity , the central peak covering the vhs , like in fig.4(c ) .",
    "we perform the calculations of the effective electronic states within a numerical iterative scheme , starting from the noninteracting solution , and assuming a fixed number of particles for determining the chemical potential . at each step",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix , eqs.([h0fs ] ) , ( [ htfs ] ) and ( [ ftfs ] ) , in @xmath128 points of the half brillouin zone , @xmath129 , and then we compute the first @xmath128 fourier harmonics for eqs.([wffs ] ) and ( [ enfs ] ) . we have taken @xmath128 in the range 10 - 40 , and we have mixed 5 - 10 landau levels . then , we use eqs .",
    "( [ chall0 ] ) and ( [ clong ] ) to calculate the conductivity tensor .",
    "in order to resolve both the van hove peaks in the modulated system and the spin splitting of the landau bands , we need a very small disorder parameter . in fig.5",
    "we show the magnetoconductivity tensor for a magnetic field @xmath31 varied such that the fermi level traverses the landau bands with @xmath2 and @xmath130 . in fig.5(a )",
    "we consider a pure electric modulation of amplitude @xmath131 mev and period @xmath132 nm . for a better understanding of the conductivity oscillations , three qualitatively different energy band structures are indicated in fig.6 , in a half brillouin zone .",
    "the bands corresponding to opposite spin directions are separated for filling factors below 4 , i.e. for @xmath133 t , due to the exchange enhancement , and they partially overlap for higher filling factors .    for the electric modulation",
    "the energy dispersion is strongly dependent on @xmath85 , due to the strong screening contained both in @xmath134 and in @xmath135 .",
    "all the landau bands shrink whenever a band is intersected by the fermi level .",
    "therefore a full spin splitting  i.e. non - overlapping bands with the same @xmath89 , but with different spin directions  can result even for a modulation amplitude much larger than @xmath136 .    due to the small band width , and also due to the pinning of the band edges to the fermi level",
    ", the resolution of the vhs peaks requires a very small disorder broadening . for our parameters",
    "the vhs can be distinguished in @xmath3 , fig.5 , and their resolution even improves with decreasing magnetic field .",
    "the reason is the increase of the exchange interaction , self - consistently with the reduction of the dos : @xmath85 decreases , the screening diminishes , and the exchange broadening is larger .",
    "nevertheless , the screening may again increase for overlapping bands , like in fig.6(c ) . in that case",
    "two bands contribute to the pinning effect , and therefore the resolution of the vhs in the states @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which yield the two maxima of @xmath3 in fig.5(a ) for 1.9 t @xmath139 2.1 t , is poorer than in the states @xmath140 and @xmath141 , that is for 2.4 t @xmath139 2.5 t and 1.6 t @xmath139 1.7 t , respectively .",
    "while the scattering component of @xmath4 is nearly identical to @xmath3 , the very small disorder parameter makes the band conductivity large . in fig.5(a ) @xmath4 is thus in the situation depicted in fig.4(c ) , with the vhs profile hidden by the band - conductivity single peak .",
    "decreasing the magnetic field , due to the stronger energy dispersion the band conductivity further increases , contrary to the scattering term , which becomes negligible .",
    "for the overlapping bands of fig.6(c ) the minimum of @xmath4 at @xmath142 t corresponds to the strongest screening , i.e. to the highest @xmath85 .    in fig.5(b ) we show similar results obtained for a purely magnetic modulation which produces landau bands equivalent to those of fig.6 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath143 t , the other parameters of the calculation being the same as those for fig.5(a ) .",
    "there are two , but unessential differences with respect to the electric modulation of fig.5(a ) .",
    "first , the energy dispersion increases with increasing landau quantum number @xmath89 . in a crude approximation ,",
    "i.e. neglecting the coulombian effects , as long as @xmath144 the energy bands are determined by the local cyclotron energy , @xmath145",
    ". second , as mentioned at the end of sec.ii , the hartree ( direct ) screening is weaker than in the electric case , and hence the strength of the exchange with respect to the hartree interaction may increase to some extent . going through fig.5(b ) from high to low values of the constant field @xmath31 ,",
    "the increase of the energy dispersion at the fermi level due to the increase of the quantum number @xmath89 is thus amplified by the exchange broadening . for filling factors higher than 4 ,",
    "four landau bands overlap , i. e. those with @xmath130 and @xmath146 .",
    "the order of the vhs observed in @xmath3 , for @xmath147 t is : @xmath140 ( @xmath148 t ) , @xmath138 ( @xmath149 t ) , @xmath137 ( @xmath150 t ) , @xmath151 ( @xmath152 t ) .",
    "the small scattering conductivity @xmath3 for 2.15  t  @xmath153  2.40  t also reflects a strong energy dispersion .",
    "additionally , the screening - exchange balance may generate weak dos fluctuations near the band edges,@xcite which can be seen as the shoulders of the band conductivity ( via the green function squared in the kubo formula ) , in @xmath4 for 2.0  t  @xmath139  2.5  t. for lower magnetic fields , when @xmath85 increases due to the overlapping bands , the exchange effects are again small , and the maxima of the scattering conductivity corresponds to the minima of the band conductivity and vice - versa .    for comparison with experiment",
    "we need to invert the conductivity tensor into resistivities , @xmath154 where @xmath155 . in our calculations",
    "@xmath156 , and hence we have @xmath157 . in fig.5(c ) we see that the resistivity measured perpendicular to the modulation reflects in fact the band conductivity , while the scattering conductivity alone can be observed only in the resistivity measured parallel to the modulation .    in the experiments on the systems with an etched electric modulation , of parameters comparable to our model , more complicated structures of the resistivity",
    "@xmath0 have been observed.@xcite the sdh maxima corresponding to a certain spin direction may show two and even three internal peaks .",
    "one possible explanation could consist in the more complicated exchange effects on the band conductivity , like the shoulders we have found for the magnetic modulation , fig.5(b ) .",
    "we have also obtained such effects for an electric modulation , with a shorter period , @xmath158 nm , when the screening is considerably reduced.@xcite another possible explanation , which is supported by the present results of the shfa , is that in the real system the band and the scattering conductivities may be comparable in magnitude , such that their superposition in @xmath4 may lead to one to three peaks per landau level , as illustrated in fig.4 . however , within our approximations",
    ", the price for the resolution of both the spin splitting and the vhs is a relatively large band conductivity .    to our knowledge ,",
    "a simultaneous measurement of both @xmath0 and @xmath159 , capable of indicating the real magnitude of the two components of the longitudinal conductivities , has been reported , at high magnetic fields , only for the short - period modulated systems,@xcite and @xmath0 has been found considerably larger than @xmath159 , but without a clear dos structure . for short periods , the hartree screening gets weaker and",
    "the landau bands become wider , such that in principle we could cover several situations , including those of fig.4 , by varying the modulation amplitude and the disorder parameter @xmath160 .",
    "we can not extend our shfa to that regime , because of the steepness of the energy dispersion which is not compatible with the assumption about the quasi - homogeneous screening of the exchange interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the results of the hfa may be satisfactory.@xcite    we want now to discuss the situation of an electric modulation with a larger amplitude , such that the landau bands overlap . in the experiment by weiss",
    "@xcite the double - peak structure of the resistivity @xmath0 has been found , while the absence of the spin splitting for the unmodulated system may be attributed to the combined disorder and thermal effects .",
    "we have recently confirmed such a possibility , within the shfa , by choosing such a disorder parameter and temperature that both the exchange enhancement of the zeeman splitting and the band conductivity have been suppressed , and @xmath0 have been obtained as resulting from fig.4(a).@xcite    in the example of fig.7 we consider the situation in which neither the spin splitting nor the vhs are resolved in the low - energy landau bands , but the vhs develop in the higher , overlapped bands .",
    "the sdh minima at filling factors around 2 and 4 are slightly shifted to higher magnetic fields .",
    "the energy gaps are small , nearly vanishing , but the adjacent bands are separated due to the pinning effect . for weaker magnetic fields , at even filling factors the vhs from the top of the landau band below the fermi level overlaps with that from the bottom of the upper band , resulting in the maxima of @xmath3 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 and in the minima for the odd filling factors @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the transition occurs around @xmath165 .",
    "since the dos decreases when the magnetic field is lowered , the screening becomes less efficient and the band width may increase when the fermi level is in a band center , leading to a large band conductivity , wherefrom the maxima of @xmath4 for @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the switching from even to odd filling factors at the resistivity minima , which we show here only for @xmath159 ( @xmath3 ) , has been recently observed for @xmath0 and supported by a transport calculation similar to the present one , but with the coulomb interaction neglected.@xcite    finally we want to mention that the plateaus we obtain for the hall resistivity , fig.7(b ) , do not correspond to plateaus of the hall conductivity , since localization effects do not exist in our model , but to the wide minima of the longitudinal conductivities . in the noninteracting approximation , and also in the hfa , for a fixed number of particles , the fermi level jumps abruptly from one landau band to the other . in the shfa",
    "the exchange interaction is very sensitive to the variation of @xmath85 , and since they are self - consistently determined , the stability of the chemical potential in an energy gap considerably improves .",
    "we have calculated energy spectra of a two - dimensional electron gas in an electric or a magnetic superlattice , and in a perpendicular magnetic field , beyond the standard hfa .",
    "the superlattice potential is smooth and the uniform magnetic field is strong , such that the electrostatic screening is very important .",
    "the essential element of our approach is the inclusion of screening in the exchange term , self - consistently with the dos at the fermi level .",
    "the numerical calculations are complicated and time consuming , such that approximations in treating the screening are unavoidable : we have only considered the static screening , in a manner appropriate to a quasi - homogeneous system .",
    "improvements of our procedure are possible , e.g. along the lines of refs .  32 ,  33 , but even within the present approach the results drastically change with respect to the hfa .",
    "the obtained screening of the exchange interaction may be even somewhat too strong , since we found that our shfa yields no charge - density - wave instability of the homogeneous 2deg , even at very low filling factors .    using a large - amplitude modulation as model for edge states , we have shown that our shfa results interpolate between the contradictory hartree and hartree - fock approximations : we obtained both compressible edge strips much wider than the magnetic length , and an enhanced spin splitting . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this expected result has never been obtained within a microscopic many - body theory before .    for a weak modulation , the standard hfa yields strong short - range oscillations of the landau bands and the particle density , which have never been observed experimentally .",
    "such oscillations completely disappear in our shfa , and we believe that these present results are much more realistic . clearly , we can not expect a quantitative agreement with experiments since , besides the approximations regarding the electron - electron interaction , we have used a rather crude simplification of the electron - impurity scattering in our transport calculation , such that the disorder vertex correction vanishes .",
    "but qualitatively , we have obtained smooth internal structures of the sdh peaks determined by the interplay of the scattering and band conductivities , the ingredients of which have been carefully analyzed .",
    "these smooth internal structures compare much more favorably with the experimental results than the sharp structures near the landau band edges obtained in the bare hfa.@xcite",
    "with the notations @xmath166 and @xmath167 where @xmath168 are the laguerre polynomials,@xcite @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , we can write the matrix elements of the noninteracting hamiltonian in the form @xmath171 -\\delta_{nn'}\\frac{\\sigma}{2}g\\mu_bb_0\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bigg[\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_c}{2z}\\frac{b_1}{b_0 } \\left(f_{nn'}(z)+\\sqrt{nn'}f_{n-1,n'-1}(z)- \\sqrt{(n+1)(n'+1)}f_{n+1,n'+1}(z)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left(v-\\frac{\\sigma}{2}g\\mu_bb_1\\right)f_{nn'}(z)\\bigg ] \\cos\\left(kx_0+(n - n')\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_c}{8z}\\left(\\frac{b_1}{b_0}\\right)^2 f_{nn'}(4z)\\cos\\left(2kx_0+(n - n')\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right ) \\label{h0fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the reflection symmetry of the external fields , we have the following parity rule , @xmath172 which also holds for the coulomb self - energy matrix elements , eq.([hfa ] ) , which depend on the self - consistent wave functions given by eq.([effwf ] ) . in order to write those matrix elements in a form suitable for a numerical calculation ,",
    "we expand the mixing coefficients in fourier series , @xmath173 where we have taken into account the parity rule .",
    "the effective energies can thus be expanded as @xmath174 and similarly the occupation numbers @xmath175    we define @xmath176 with this notation , and using eqs.([wffs ] ) and ( [ fffs ] ) , the fourier coefficients of the particle density can be written , by inverting eq.([parden ] ) , as @xmath177    the matrix elements of the hartree term , defined by eqs.([hfa ] ) and ( [ parden ] ) , can now be put in the form @xmath178 where we have used the fourier transform of the coulomb potential .",
    "the corresponding fourier series for the fock term of the hamiltonian , eq.([fter ] ) , can be found by directly searching for the fourier amplitudes , and after a lengthy , but straight forward calculation , one gets @xmath179 where s denote the exchange integrals @xmath180 with @xmath181 the bessel functions .",
    "for the homogeneous system the self - consistent wave functions are identical with the landau wave functions , so that @xmath182 , and the exchange integrals reduce to @xmath183 .",
