    "as far as the bulk viscosity is concerned , it is non - vanishing , as expected .",

    "the idea for the computation of the speed of sound from thermodynamics is quite simple :    * compute the one - point correlation function for the stress - energy tensor @xmath34 ; * extract the pressure @xmath35 and the energy density @xmath36 from @xmath34 ; * apply the thermodynamics relation ( [ vs ] )    the one - point correlation function for the stress - energy tensor , which is defined at the boundary of the spacetime @xmath37 , turns out to be infinite , so it requires to be regularized and renormalized@xcite@xcite : the spacetime @xmath37 can be considered as foliated along the radial coordinate @xmath38 in timelike surfaces @xmath39 ( they are homomorphic to the boundary @xmath40 of @xmath37 ) whose metric is evaluated at the boundary . the renormalized stress - energy tensor is obtained by evaluating at the boundary @xmath40 the variation , with respect the metric of @xmath39 , of an action which is the sum of ( [ effact ] ) , the standard gibbons - hawking term and the counterterm action @xmath41 can be found in refs .  .",

    "thus , the energy density ( adm mass ) can be extracted from ( [ 1pt ] ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the unit vector normal to a spacelike surface @xmath50 in @xmath40 , @xmath51 is the determinant of the induced metric on @xmath50 , @xmath52 is the norm of the timelike killing vector in ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath50 is homogeneous and isotropic , the pressure is given by : @xmath53    from the asymptotic expansions of the solutions of the equations ( [ eom ] ) and ( [ constr ] ) ( for more computational details , see ref .  ) and from ( [ adm ] ) and ( [ press ] ) , we obtain in the high temperature limit at the lowest order in @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56^{4}}{3\\pi^{4 } }                \\mathbf{\\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2 } }                + \\ldots\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath57^{4}}{\\pi^{4 } }                \\mathbf{\\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2 } }                + \\ldots\\right].\\ ] ] it is also possible to compute the entropy density@xcite : @xmath58^{4}}{\\pi^4 }                \\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2}+\\ldots\\right]\\ ] ] and verify that ( [ ef ] ) , ( [ pf ] ) and ( [ s ] ) satisfy the relation @xmath59 as expected .",
    "it is now easy to apply the formula ( [ vs ] ) and obtain the leading correction to the speed of sound : @xmath60^{4}}{3\\pi^{4 } }                    \\mathbf{\\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2 } }                    + \\ldots\\right].\\ ] ] some comments about ( [ vsf ] ) , ( [ ef ] ) and ( [ pf ] ) are mandatory .",
    "it is to be pointed out that in absence of mass deformations , the correct results for conformal gauge theories are reproduced ( they are given by the zeroth - order terms ) : this was expected since , without the mass deformation , the @xmath0 theory reduces to the @xmath1 superconformal yang - mills .",
    "moreover , all these expressions show corrections which are mass - parameter dependent : this implies that such results are not universal , but they depend on the particular gauge theory . as a final remark ,",
    "the lowest order corrections to the speed of sound are negative in sign : the speed of sound for the @xmath0 theory is predicted to be less than the speed of sound for a conformal field theory .",
    "as is known@xcite , the correlation functions of a gauge theory can be reproduced from supergravity by studying the fluctuations of the background geometry : @xmath61 where @xmath62 satisfy the background equations of motions and @xmath63 are the fluctuations of the supergravity fields .",
    "we choose the following gauge : @xmath64 and assume that the perturbations depend only on @xmath65 : there is an @xmath66 rotational invariance in the @xmath67-plane which allows them to be classified by the spin :    * spin 2 : @xmath68 ; @xmath69 * spin 1 : @xmath70 ; @xmath71 * spin 0 : @xmath72 .",
    "these sets of fluctuations decouple from each other .",
    "the spin 2 perturbations separately describe the scalar modes ; the two sets of spin 1 fluctuations separately allow to compute the correlation functions showing the diffusion pole ; the spin 0 set contains the sound modes .",
    "we are , therefore , interested in the scalar perturbations .",
    "the correlation functions are computed by using the minkowski prescription proposed in ref .  : in order to obtain retarded green functions , we require , as one of the boundary conditions , that the fluctuations correspond to incoming wave at the horizon . such a boundary condition is to be imposed only on the physical modes : as shown in ref .  , pure gauge solutions are also present , but they can be eliminated@xcite .",
    "it is now possible to analyze the physical fluctuations in the hydrodynamic limit , i.e. in the low frequency and momentum limit with their ratio kept constant : @xmath73 in this way we obtain some analytical equations which require numerical techniques to be solved .    for convenience",
    ", the dispersion relation for the hydrodynamic pole is parametrized in the following way : @xmath74^{4}}{4\\pi^3 }                 \\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2 }                \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\         & - &     i\\frac{q^{2}}{3 }                \\left[1+\\beta^{\\gamma}_{1}\\frac{1}{576\\pi^2 }                 \\left(\\frac{m_{b}}{t}\\right)^{4}+                 \\beta_{2}^{\\gamma}\\frac{[\\gamma(\\frac{3}{4})]^{4}}{4\\pi^3 }                 \\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2 }                \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is evident how the coefficients @xmath75 are related to the speed of sound , while @xmath76 provide the dispersion .",
    "the numerical techniques discussed in ref .",
    "lead to the following results :    * @xmath77 * @xmath78    where the number between brackets indicates an error in the corresponding digit .",
    "a comparison between the coefficients ( [ coeffv ] ) and the value for the speed of sound obtained by the thermodynamics approach shows that the results are in perfect agreement .",
    "this is a non - trivial check for our prediction .",
    "as far as the coefficients ( [ coeffd ] ) are concerned , they allow to make a prediction for the bulk viscosity : @xmath79^{4}}{4\\pi^3 }                \\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2}+\\ldots\\right].\\ ] ]    as expected , the @xmath0 gauge theory is characterized by a non - vanishing bulk viscosity . as in the case of the speed of sound , it is possible to argue from the expression ( [ bulk ] ) that , in absence of mass deformation , the known result for the conformal theories is obtained .",
    "moreover , the corrections introduced by the mass deformation are mass - parameter dependent : the bulk viscosity is gauge - theory specific as well .    it is possible to rewrite ( [ bulk ] ) in the following way : @xmath80^{4}}{3\\pi^3 }                \\left(\\frac{m_{f}}{t}\\right)^{2}+\\ldots\\right].\\ ] ] from the expressions of the speed of sound ( [ vsf ] ) and of the bulk viscosity ( [ bsv ] ) , it is possible to argue that , at least in the high temperature limit , the ratio of the bulk viscosity to shear viscosity is proportional to the deviation of the speed of sound from its value in the conformal theories : @xmath81 where : @xmath82 such a result disagrees with the relation predicted in ref .   and already criticized in ref .  :",
    "the gauge / string correspondence allowed us to study the sound waves for a non - conformal gauge theory ( the @xmath0 model ) .",
    "in particular , the speed of sound for such a theory was obtained by two different computations : from thermodynamics by ( [ thvs ] ) relating speed of sound , pressure and density of energy , and from the hydrodynamic pole .",
    "the results are found to be in agreement with each other .",
    "moreover , the speed of sound for the @xmath0 gauge theory turned out to be less than the speed of sound for the conformal theories : in the high temperature regime the mass deformations introduced negative corrections .",
    "moreover , a prediction for the bulk viscosity for a non - conformal gauge theory was made : as expected , the value found was non - vanishing .",
    "both the speed of sound and the bulk viscosity turned out to be non - universal quantities : the corrections depend on the mass - parameter of the particular theory , so that different values of such quantities correspond to different non - conformal strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "we hope that this dual supergravity analysis of plasma transport coefficients can be useful both in a future analysis of such coefficients for qcd and in hydrodynamic models at rhic .",
