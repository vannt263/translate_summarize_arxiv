    "the low temperature acoustic and thermal properties of amorphous , glassy materials are remarkably similar and they can be explained  to a large extent  by assuming that the material contains a large number of dynamic defects .",
    "these dynamic defects are tunneling systems ( ts ) which are modeled by an ensemble of two - level systems ( tls ) @xcite .",
    "crystals with defects  with a large enough amount of disorder  exhibit also glass - like properties , but these properties are not so universal and , even more , they are not isotropic  for example the absorption and the propagation velocity change of elastic waves depend on the propagation and polarization directions of the wave @xcite",
    ".    a microscopic model of the tunneling systems is still missing .",
    "for this reason , the study of disordered crystals is especially interesting because it offers additional information : in some materials we know quite well which are the entities that tunnel between different equilibrium positions . beside this , the anisotropy of the tls - sound wave interaction in crystals represents another challenge to the interaction models of tlss which requires clarification .",
    "a free tls is described in a two - dimensional hilbert space by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pauli matrices ; the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are called the _ asymmetry of the potential _ and _ tunnel splitting _ , respectively .",
    "the excitation rate of the tls , @xmath5 , is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath6 and this gives @xmath7 .",
    "the perturbation of the free tls , induced by a strain field is @xmath8 , where in general @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the strain tensor and @xmath11 a symmetric tensor that characterizes the tls and its interaction with the strain field  here , as everywhere in this paper , we assume _ summation over repeated indices_. in bulk isotropic materials , like in amorphous solids , the elastic waves may be decomposed into longitudinally and transversely plane waves and the interaction term @xmath12 may be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the polarization , @xmath15 ( longitudinal ) or @xmath16 ( transversal ) , of the perturbing wave . in this case",
    "the absorption rate of a phonon of polarization @xmath14 and wavevector @xmath17 , by a tls is @xmath18 where by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 we denote the population of the phonon mode , the density of the solid , the sound velocity and the volume of the solid , respectively . if the number of tlss of asymmetry and tunnel splitting in the intervals @xmath23 and @xmath24 is @xmath25 , then integrating @xmath26 over the tls ensemble and using @xmath27^{-1}$ ] , we obtain the _ standard _ total phonon absorption rate , @xmath28 where we introduced the short - hand notation @xmath29 .",
    "although widely used , the simplified version of the tunneling model exposed above can not account for the anisotropy of the glass - like properties observed in disordered crystals . to explain this anisotropy , in refs",
    "@xcite we applied the model introduced in @xcite . in this model , a direction @xmath30 is associated to each tls [ @xmath31 , where the superscript @xmath32 denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector ] and @xmath12 was written in the form @xcite @xmath33\\cdot{{\\bf s}},\\ ] ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the strain tensor in abbreviated subscript notations .",
    "the @xmath36 symmetric matrix @xmath37 $ ] contains the tls - strain field coupling constants @xmath38 and its structure is determined by the symmetries of the lattice in which the tls is embedded . in refs .",
    "@xcite we applied this model to calculate the glassy properties of disordered cubic ( ca stabilized zirconium @xcite ) , trigonal ( neutron irradiated quartz @xcite ) and hexagonal crystals . here",
    "we shall report results on tetragonal lattices .",
    "in the new model , the phonon absorption rate by a tls is @xmath39\\cdot{{\\bf s}}_{{{\\bf k}}\\sigma}|^2\\delta(\\epsilon-\\hbar\\omega ) .",
    "\\label{eqn_gamma_bar}\\ ] ] we see that the main characteristic of the tls - phonon interaction is contained in the quantity",
    "@xmath40\\cdot{{\\bf s}}_{{{\\bf k}}\\sigma}$ ] , which bears an intrinsic anisotropy through the matrix @xmath37 $ ] , on which the symmetries of the lattice are imposed @xcite to calculate the average scattering rate of a phonon by the ensemble of tlss , now we have to average not only over the distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but also over the distribution of @xmath30 .",
    "in this way we get the total phonon absorption rate , @xmath41 to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the problem , in what follows we shall assume that @xmath30 is isotropically oriented .    for a tetragonal lattice of symmetry classes _ 4 mm , 422 , @xmath422 m , 4/mmm _ , the matrix @xmath37 $ ] has the form @xcite @xmath43 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc } r_{11}&r_{12}&r_{13}&0&0&0\\\\ r_{12}&r_{11}&r_{13}&0&0&0\\\\ r_{13}&r_{13}&r_{33}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&r_{44}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&r_{44}&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&r_{66 } \\end{array}\\right ) , & & \\label{r_trigonal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar to that of the tensor of elastic stiffness constants , @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the difference between the trigonal lattice of symmetry _ 32 _ and the chosen classes of tetragonal lattice is that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are zero . in that sense",
    "the hexagonal and tetragonal lattices are similar to each other . however , in contrast to both hexagonal and trigonal _ 32 _ systems , for the tetragonal lattice the condition @xmath47 does not hold anymore . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of independent constants is equal to that for trigonal _ 32 _ lattice , whereas the structure of @xmath37 $ ] is similar to that for the hexagonal lattice .    for concreteness",
    ", we shall consider the class _ 422 _ , with a system of coordinates chosen such that the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axes are the 4-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry axes , respectively , while the @xmath50 axis is perpendicular to both @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "solving the christoffel equation we find that the crystal can sustain pure transversal waves in all three directions , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 .",
    "for the transversal waves propagating in the @xmath49 direction , the ones polarized in the @xmath48 direction propagate with the velocity @xmath51 whereas the ones polarized in the @xmath50 direction propagate with the velocity @xmath52 .",
    "the transversal waves propagating in the @xmath50 direction are similar to the ones propagating in the @xmath49 direction : the waves polarized in the @xmath49 direction have a sound velocity of @xmath52 , whereas the ones polarized in the @xmath48 direction have a sound velocity of @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the transversal waves propagating in the @xmath48 direction have all the same sound velocity , @xmath51 .",
    "averaging over the directions @xmath30 we obtain for the transversely polarized waves propagating in the @xmath53,@xmath54 and @xmath55 directions the results    [ av_deft ] @xmath56 and @xmath57    in obvious notations : the first subscript indicates the propagation direction and the second denotes the direction of polarization . plugging equations ( [ av2_def ] ) and ( [ av3_def ] ) into ( [ av_def ] ) we obtain the general type of expression @xmath58 where the superscript @xmath59 comes from the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "concretely , the new @xmath60 constants are    [ gammash ] @xmath61    the ratio @xmath62 can be obtained by measuring the characteristics ( sound velocity change or attenuation rate ) of elastic waves propagating along the @xmath63 crystallographic directions .",
    "it is interesting to note now the similarity between relations like @xmath64 and relations like @xmath65 that hold for tetragonal lattices ",
    "@xmath66 is the velocity of a transversal sound wave propagating along the @xmath49 direction and polarized along the @xmath50 direction .",
    "we calculated the average scattering rates of pure transversal phonon modes on the tlss in tetragonal disordered crystals , to emphasize the anisotropy of the glass - like properties imposed by the lattice anisotropy .",
    "two of the parameters of the model  the tls - strain field coupling constants  may be obtained by measuring attenuation rates or sound velocity changes of elastic waves propagating along the different @xmath63 directions .",
    "determining the coupling constants enables one to calculate the glassy properties of the crystal in any direction .",
    "the calculations can be extended easily to disordered crystals of any symmetry . moreover , although we used in our calculations an isotropic distribution over the tls orientations , the comparison of our calculations with experimental data would enable one to find if our assumption is true or not . if it is not true , one can determine , at least in principle , the distribution of the orientations of the tlss ."
