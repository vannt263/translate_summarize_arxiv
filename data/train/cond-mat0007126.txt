    "the existence and nature of the wetting transition @xcite at a temperature above the triple point @xmath4 ( and below the critical temperature ) is known to be the result of a delicate balance between the interatomic potential acting among the atoms in the liquid and the atom - substrate interaction potential @xcite .",
    "when the latter dominates , the fluid tends to wet the surface . because of the extremely weak interaction between he atoms , liquid @xmath5he in contact with almost any substrate spreads to form a continuous film over the surface , so that vapor and substrate are never in contact , thus making @xmath5he the ideal wetting agent .",
    "a remarkable exception to this behavior is found when @xmath5he is adsorbed on heavy alkali metal surfaces : due to the large electron spill - out at their surface , alkali metals provide the weakest adsorption potentials in nature for he atoms .",
    "based on this observation , it was suggested @xcite that wetting and prewetting transitions of @xmath5he ought to occurr on cs ( which exerts the weakest attraction to he atoms ) and , perhaps , rb substrates .",
    "actually , experimental evidence that he@xmath5 on a cs substrate exhibits a wetting transition @xcite at @xmath6 k has been collected .",
    "the results for @xmath5he on rb are more controversial , since both a prewetting transition accompanied by complete wetting down to @xmath7 k @xcite , ( this is analogous to triple point wetting ) and a wetting transition @xcite at a nonzero @xmath8 k have been reported . on the more attractive substrate of potassium , wetting behavior has been observed for all @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have proven to be a very useful tool to study the wetting properties of fluids .",
    "in particular , density functional ( df ) methods @xcite have become increasingly popular in recent years because of their ability to describe inhomogeneous fluids and phase equilibria . a comparison with  exact ",
    "monte carlo simulation results shows that , once the long - range ( van der waals ) attractive forces exerted by a surface on the gas atoms are included in the free energy functional , density functional methods provide a qualitatively ( and most often quantitatively ) good description of the thermodynamics of gas adsorption on a solid surface and correctly predict a large variety of phase transitions ( wetting , prewetting , layering , etc . ) .",
    "in particular , a quite accurate description of the @xmath7 properties of liquid @xmath5he has been obtained within a df approach by using the energy functional proposed in ref.@xcite and later improved in ref.@xcite .",
    "this phenomenological functional has been widely tested in a variety of problems involving inhomogeneous phases of liquid @xmath5he ( surfaces , droplets , films , etc . )",
    "@xcite , and is known to give a good description of the @xmath7 properties of the liquid - vapor interface and also of some properties of liquid @xmath5he on various substrates @xcite ( for a thorough comparison between these and other functionals used to describe liquid @xmath5he at @xmath7 , see ref .",
    "a very remarkable example of success of such theoretical framework is the prediction of the non - wetting behavior of liquid @xmath5he on heavy - alkali metals at zero absolute temperature @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we extend the theory of refs.@xcite to finite temperatures and apply the functional to the study of wetting properties of @xmath5he adsorbed on alkali metal surfaces . a preliminary account of this work has been presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a previous attempt to construct a semi - empirical finite - temperature density functional for @xmath5he has been reported in ref.@xcite . there , a _ local _ functional of the density was used ( i.e. where the he - he interaction terms correspond to an attractive two - body contact force ) , with a number of parameters adjusted to guarantee the correct liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "the agreement with the experimental surface tension of liquid @xmath10he at saturated vapor pressure was also imposed by construction .",
    "this functional has been applied to the study of the behavior of the liquid - vapor interface thickness as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite , however , that a local theory gives incorrect fluid structures in situations where the liquid is perturbed on a microscopic scale , as it happens close to a solid substrate .",
    "this failure is due to the zero - range nature of the skyrme interaction used in ref.@xcite , which completely neglects the short - range correlations associated with the interatomic potential hard - core .",
    "for this reason , in our work we rather use as a starting point for our finite - temperature calculations the _ non - local _ form of the density functional proposed in ref.@xcite , where a more realistic finite - range interactions between he atoms is included .",
    "contrary to what happens with the local functional @xcite , this non - local functional with parameters fitted to bulk properties provides the correct asymptotic behavior of the surface potential profile without any ad - hoc prescription , which is a desirable feature in order to properly describe the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "in the density - functional approach the grand - canonical free - energy is considered a functional of the density @xmath11 :    @xmath12=f[\\rho ] -\\mu \\int d{\\bf { r\\;}}\\rho ( { \\bf { r } ) } \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the chemical potential and @xmath14 $ ] is the free - energy density functional .",

    "the last term contains the gradient of the density at different points and corresponds to a non - local correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "we remark at this point that the quantum kinetic energy term appearing in ( [ eq : free ] ) ( as well as in other phenomenological density functional theories used to describe inhomogeneous @xmath5he ) is derived from the _ total _",
    "density @xmath11 .",
    "however , as discussed in ref.@xcite , a complete density functional theory of bose - condensed liquids would rather involve functionals of both the local density @xmath11 and the local order parameter @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the local condensate density .",
    "in particular , the counterpart of the first term in ( [ eq : free ] ) would be proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "a rationalization of why the simplified form of the density functional used here ( and in all other applications of  df theory to liquid @xmath5he as well ) leads to a satisfactory description of the surface can be traced to the fact that the two quantum kinetic energy terms coincide in the low density surface region , which is important for the interface problems , where @xmath30 @xcite .    in the t=0 functional @xcite",

    "@xcite indicates also that the thickness of the liquid - vapor interface , at a given temperature , is sligthly smaller than that obtained from the zero - range functional of ref.@xcite .    from the calculated equilibrium density profiles one can directly compute the liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath81 , from the definition @xmath82 . here",

    "the dependence of the liquid - vapor surface tension of @xmath90he on temperature has been extensively investigated in the past .",

    "we get the structure of the solid - vapor and solid - liquid interfaces by minimizing the grand - potential ( [ eq : etot ] ) subject to the additional constraint that the density in a large region between the two surfaces ( where bulk behavior is expected ) is equal respectively to @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the corresponding surface excess  energies per unit area @xmath98 are the solid - vapor @xmath96 and the solid - liquid @xmath99 surface tensions .",

    "note the oscillations of the liquid density close to the surface , due to close - packing effects .",
    "we have checked , by means of similar calculations with different cell sizes , that at least @xmath103 must separate the two attractive surfaces so that the two fluid - solid interfaces are effectively decoupled and the calculation gives a converged value for the surface tensions @xmath100 and @xmath96 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : young ] ) , wetting of a surface occurs at a temperature @xmath69 such that    @xmath104    in fig .",
    "4 we show the behavior of the two sides of eq.([eq : wett ] ) as a function of temperature , for three different alkali surfaces . a common feature of the curves for @xmath105 shown in fig .",
    "4 is their rather weak temperature dependence , as indeed observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the predicted wetting temperature for cs , @xmath106 , is in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath107 .",
    "also in the case of @xmath5he on k our calculated results shown in fig.4 agree with experiments @xcite , indicating wetting at any @xmath9 . on the contrary ,",
    "for rb our calculations predict a wetting temperature @xmath108  k , in marked disagreement with the experimental findings which show instead either complete wetting down to @xmath7 @xcite , or a wetting transition at @xmath109 k @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 the temperature dependence of the contact angle for the @xmath10he / cs system as obtained from our calculations , together with the available experimental data .",
    "although the equilibrium contact angle is a well defined thermodynamic quantity , measurements of this quantity invariably show a strong hysteretic behavior , i.e. the measured value of the contact angle depends on whether the contact line is advancing or receding .",
    "for relatively homogenous surfaces , however , it has been shown that the advancing contact angle is a good measure of the equilibrium contact angle , so we compare our results with the experimental values for that quantity .",
    "the contact angle for @xmath5he on cs surfaces has been measured by different groups in recent years by using different techniques @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the contact angle is measured by direct visual inspection of macroscopic droplets of superfluid @xmath5he on a cs surface . in ref.@xcite",
    "the contact angle is obtained by means of direct optical measurement using interferometric techniques @xcite , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite it is measured , much more indirectly , from the reduction in pressure due to capillarity , when an array of parallel tungsten plates coated with cesium are immersed into liquid @xmath5he .",
    "our results are compared in fig.5 with the aforementioned experimental data .",
    "the overall agreement with the results from ref.@xcite is satisfying , although a strong discrepancy exist with the data of ref.@xcite .    at variance with the overall satisfactory quantitative agreement we get for the @xmath5he / cs system , our predictions seems to be wrong for the @xmath5he / rb system .",
    "we believe that this disagreement is probably due to the fact that our assumptions of a rigid and planar substrate are far from being satisfied in this case .",
    "impurities or roughness , in fact , are always present on the surface , as indicated by the strong hysterectic behaviour of the contact angle observed in all experiments when studying advancing or receding contact lines .",
    "this condition may be particularly severe in the case of the rb surface , where defects and roughness are known to be present to a larger extent than on the surface of cs .",
    "the heterogeneity of the substrate is known to promote wetting , i.e. leads to values of @xmath105 higher than for an ideal substrate . in the case of @xmath0he on rb , as apparent from fig.4 , an increase of @xmath110 would shift the wetting temperature towards lower values , as indeed found in the experiments .",
    "the characterization of the wetting behavior of superfluid helium on rough surfaces is a very difficult task .",
    "the quality of the substrates used in the experiments can not be determined at lengthscales smaller than optical wavelengths .",
    "the theoretical description of the effects of heterogeneities is also challenging .",
    "only few theoretical results are available on the effect of microscopic disorder @xcite on the wetting properties of fluids adsorbed on weakly attractive surfaces .",
    "the effect of model disorder ( on an atomic scale ) on the wetting properties of ne on the mg surface has been studied by curtarolo et al .",
    "one interesting conclusion contained in this paper is that roughness destroy the discontinuous nature of the wetting transition , even if a trace of discontinuities remain in the calculated isotherms .    in ref.@xcite a lennard - jones fluid and its wetting properties on molecularly rough surfaces",
    "have been studied by using molecular dynamics .",
    "contrary to the conventional belief that surface roughness reduces the contact angle thus making it easier to wet a rough surface than a smooth one , the surprising conclusion of this work is that the contact angle is larger for the rough surface than for the smooth one .    in order to have further insight into this important issue , we are currently investigating the effect of a realistic distribution of microscopic disorder on the wetting transition of @xmath5he on the rb surface within the density functional approach described here @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the disagreement with the experiments for the @xmath0he / rb system is that the he - rb surface potential used in our calculations is inaccurate .",
    "our overestimate of the wetting temperature would be a sign , in this case , that the calculated potential is slightly less attractive than required to provide a result closer to the experimental one .",
    "we have thus tried a modified he / rb surface interaction by changing sligtly the two parameters entering the repulsive part of the ab - initio potential @xmath55 describing the he - surface interaction .",
    "the modified potential , has a minimum of depth @xmath111 mev located at @xmath112 , to be compared with the values @xmath113 mev and @xmath114 obtained with the original parameters .",
    "such a tiny variation in the adsorption potential ( @xmath115 increase in the potential well depth ) has quite a large effect on the he / rb wetting temperature , as can be judged from the curve labeled @xmath116 in fig .",
    "4 . with this modified potential",
    "the wetting transition moves very close to @xmath7 , as in the experiments .",
    "interestingly , in this case the curve @xmath117 almost coincides with the curve @xmath118 for a range of @xmath68 values , between @xmath119 and @xmath120 k ( at such temperatures the contribution @xmath121 is negligible in our approximations ) .",
    "this could provide a reason for the different experimental estimates of the wetting temperature ( either @xmath7 or @xmath122k ) by different groups : in the region where the two curves almost overlap their slope is very small , and thus small variations in the quality of the substrate may result in rather different wetting temperatures .",
    "moreover , this could also suggest a different character of the wetting transition for he / rb , since similar slopes in @xmath117 and @xmath118 imply a small discontinuity in @xmath123 , i.e. a quasi - continuous transition .",
    "we have extended to finite temperatures the non - local density functional proposed in recent years to describe the @xmath5he properties at t=0 @xcite , and studied the wetting behavior of @xmath5he adsorbed on alkali metal surfaces .",
    "the density functional depends on a number of temperature - dependent phenomenological parameters which are adjusted to reproduce _ bulk _ experimental properties of liquid @xmath5he at saturated vapor pressure .",
    "we find that the resulting functional describes accurately the properties of the liquid - vapor interface of the free @xmath5he surface . in the presence of an external potential simulating a planar , solid surface",
    "whose binding properties reproduce those of alkali metal surfaces , it also accurately reproduces the properties of the @xmath5he / cs system , giving the temperature dependence of the contact angle in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the contact angle vanishes at @xmath124 , in agreement with the experimental measure for the wetting temperature , @xmath125 . for @xmath5he on a k surface , we find wetting at all nonzero temperatures , as found also in experiments . for @xmath5he on the rb surface ,",
    "however , our calculations fail to reproduce quantitatively the experiments , indicating a wetting transition at @xmath126 .",
    "the discrepancy with experiments could be either due to our neglect of surface inhomogeneities , which are known to be present on this surface to a larger extent than on a cs surface , or to some inaccuracy in the theoretical determination of the surface - adatom potential used in our calculations .",
    "if this is the case , our results indicate that the correct potential should be slightly more attractive than currently believed .",

    "<S> we have studied the wetting properties of @xmath0he adsorbed on the surface of heavy alkali metals by using a non - local free - energy density - functional which describes accurately the surface properties of liquid @xmath0he in the temperature range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath0he on the cs surface give both the temperature dependence of the contact angle and the wetting temperature in good agreement with the experimental findings . for the @xmath0he / rb system </S>",
    "<S> we find that a wetting transition on the rb surface occurs at @xmath2 , whereas the experiments show either wetting down to t=0 or a wetting transition at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this disagreement is due either to an inaccuracy of the fluid - substrate potential used in our calculations or the consequence of substrate roughness , which is known to affect the rb surface , and whose effect would be to lower the wetting temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the wetting transition to the he - surface potential are stressed for the he / rb surface , which may justify the controversial experimental findings for this system .    </S>",
