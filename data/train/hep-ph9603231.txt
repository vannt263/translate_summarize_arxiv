    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 corresponds to the interaction of longitudinally polarized photons in the one  photon  exchange approximation of deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath0 is difficult since it usually requires measurement of the energy dependence of this process for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 vanishes within the naive parton model @xcite and also in the leading logarithmic approximation of qcd . in the next  to",
    " leading order approximation the structure function @xmath0 acquires a leading twist contribution proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the main process contributing to @xmath0 at low @xmath1 is photon ",
    "gluon fusion , @xmath5 .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 is therefore mainly sensitive to the gluon distribution .    in practice",
    "it is the ratio @xmath6 which is determined experimentally ( where @xmath7 is transverse structure function ) .",
    "current measurements of @xmath8 ( slac , nmc at cern @xcite ) are very scarce , especially at low @xmath1 . in the region of large @xmath2",
    "the structure function @xmath0 is fairly well described by perturbative qcd , while at lower values of @xmath2 it is not well understood mainly because of the non  perturbative contributions .",
    "a better understanding of @xmath0 and @xmath9 in this region is important in order to implement the radiative corrections needed for the extraction of the @xmath10 structure functions from deep inelastic scattering measurements .",
    "it is also crucial for the reliable extraction of the spin dependent structure function @xmath11 @xcite from experimental data , since the uncertainties in @xmath9 are one of the main sources of systematic errors .",
    "in this paper we present a model for the structure function @xmath0 which provides extrapolation into the region of low @xmath2 .",
    "we also propose a model for the higher twist term .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the contribution of quarks having limited transverse momenta is dominated by soft pomeron exchange .",
    "we introduce an effective coupling which can be determined from the background contribution to the structure function @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "calculations for @xmath8 in the region of low @xmath2 are also presented .",
    "this paper is based on the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the off  shell approximation is closely connected with the @xmath13 ( or high energy ) factorization theorem @xcite which can be presented in the following way , @xmath14 the dominant diagram for the @xmath0 is shown on fig.1 , where @xmath15 are the longitudinal fraction of proton s momentum and the transverse momentum of the gluon @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the function @xmath17 can be regarded as the longitudinal structure function of the off ",
    "shell gluon with virtuality @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the unintegrated gluon distribution which in principle should be obtained from the bfkl equation @xcite . in formula ( [ ktfakt ] ) there is double convolution over the variables @xmath20 and @xmath13 , and therefore it is called the off  shell approach . on the other hand the well known renormalization group analysis is basically connected with collinear factorization formula , @xmath21 the @xmath22 are the integrated parton distribution functions which satisfy conventional altarelli - parisi equations @xcite and @xmath23 are the coefficient functions which can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the summation is performed over different species of partons and @xmath24 is a factorization scale which usually is taken to be @xmath2 in case of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the leading twist part of the @xmath13 factorization formula can be recast into the collinear form ( [ kolfakt ] ) where all small @xmath20 @xmath25 effects are resummed to all orders in @xmath26 @xmath27 in the splitting ( and coefficient ) functions .",
    "for instance the moments of the coefficient functions @xmath28 @xmath29 are related to the double moment function @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 the quantity @xmath34 is the gluon anomalous dimension related to the appropriate splitting function by @xmath35 knowing the expansion of @xmath36 in terms of the anomalous dimension and the expansion of @xmath37 in powers of @xmath38 , one can obtain the following formula for the coefficient function @xmath39 ( in case of @xmath0 ) , @xmath40   \\label{coefexp}\\ ] ] where as @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "if instead of the bfkl solution in ( [ ktfakt ] ) , we take @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a solution of the altarelli - parisi equations without small @xmath1 corrections in @xmath45 but preserving the original phase space ( no @xmath13 ordering ) , then only the first three non - trivial corrections in small @xmath1 are included in the expansion for @xmath46 .",
    "this approximation seems to be reliable , but not of course at very low values of @xmath1 where the bfkl effects could play an important role . in our calculations we consider @xmath47 .",
    "here we show how after an expanding the integrand in the off  shell formula ( [ ktfakt ] ) around @xmath48 one can obtain the on  shell approximation @xcite with additional power corrections .",
    "if we use the @xmath13 factorization theorem to calculate @xmath0 , then we obtain the following form for @xmath0 at low @xmath1 and large @xmath2 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 the transverse momentum @xmath53 and the variable @xmath20 are defined as follows : @xmath54 @xmath55 the integration over @xmath20 is implicit in ( [ flint ] ) .",
    "one can make it explicit by changing the variables from @xmath56 to @xmath20 using the above formula ( [ yq ] ) .",
    "the integration limits in ( [ flint ] ) are additionally constrained by the condition : @xmath57 the condition @xmath58 demanded by the integration limit is automatically satisfied , see ( [ yq ] ) . in the on ",
    "shell approximation of the formulae ( [ flsum],[flint ] ) one expands integrands of the corresponding integrals around @xmath59 and retains the leading term .",
    "the integrals @xmath60 can then be expressed in terms of the conventional integrated gluon distribution @xmath61 @xmath62 where now @xmath63 and @xmath64 in order to extrapolate formula ( [ flsum ] ) ( with @xmath60 given by ( [ flint ] ) or ( [ iq ] ) ) to the low @xmath2 region we have to freeze the evolution of @xmath61 and the argument of @xmath4 . to do this we substitute @xmath65 instead of @xmath2 as the argument of @xmath66 and of @xmath67 .",
    "this substitution may be justified by analyticity arguments i.e. we want @xmath60 to have threshold singularities for @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , for heavy quarks and for moderately large values of @xmath2 , it is the heavy mass squared and not @xmath2 which should be taken as the scale of @xmath66 and of the parton distributions .",
    "it should be noted that after these modifications the structure function @xmath0 can be continued down to @xmath69 , respecting the kinematical constraint @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "the formula ( [ iq ] ) can be rearranged to give the altarelli - martinelli @xcite integral over @xmath72 but with the modified integration limits and additional power corrections .",
    "first we use @xmath72 and @xmath73 as the integration variables instead of @xmath74 and @xmath73 . from ( [ dq ] )",
    "we find @xmath75 @xmath76 from eq .",
    "( [ kappap2 ] ) we can deduce various integration limits since @xmath77 and since @xmath78 , @xmath79 from inequality ( [ limit2 ] ) we obtain the lower limit for integration over @xmath72 @xmath80 and of course , @xmath81 it is convenient to make another change of the integration variables : @xmath82 the inequality ( [ limit2 ] ) gives the following limits for the variable @xmath83 @xmath84 finally we get the following representation for @xmath0 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87    it should be noted that expressions ( [ iq2],[iq3],[iq4 ] ) reduce to the following formula @xmath88 given by @xcite in the limit .",
    "the expression @xmath89 represents the power correction enhanced by the logarithmic factor @xmath90 .",
    "the modification of the lower limit becomes obvious , if we consider the energy  momentum conservation constraint for the subprocess @xmath91 .",
    "the kinematical constraint restricts the behaviour of @xmath0 in the region of small values of @xmath2 . analysing the longitudinal cross section for deep inelastic scattering one concludes that in order to remove the possible singularities of this observable at @xmath92 , ( i.e. @xmath93 ) , @xmath0 should behave as @xmath94",
    "this implies that @xmath95 , so it vanishes in the real photoproduction limit as expected .",
    "phenomenological analysis of the quantity @xmath9 in the region of moderately large @xmath2 ( @xmath96 ) implies that the higher twist effects ( i.e. terms that behave like @xmath97 as @xmath98 ) should play an important role @xcite .    in this paragraph",
    "we introduce a phenomenological model for the higher twist term which satisfies the constraint @xmath99 as @xmath92 .",
    "the idea is to treat the contributions from low and high quark momenta in a different way .",
    "we divide the integration over @xmath56 ( in ( [ flint ] ) for the off  shell model ( or in ( [ iq3]),([iq4 ] ) for the on  shell model ) into two parts  the region @xmath100 , and @xmath101  where @xmath102 is an arbitrary cut  off , chosen to be of order @xmath103 .",
    "the region of high momenta is treated in the usual way ( using off  shell ( [ flsum],[flint ] ) or on  shell ( [ iq2],[iq3],[iq4 ] ) formula ) whereas for low momenta we assume the existence of an effective coupling constant : @xmath104 the constant @xmath105 is not a free parameter .",
    "we can estimate it from @xmath106 assuming that the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath106 in the scaling region also comes from the region of low values of @xmath107 and is controlled by the same parameter .",

    "it also obeys the kinematical constraint for the structure function @xmath0 , i.e. vanishes like @xmath94 for @xmath109 .    to evaluate the constant @xmath105 we consider the corresponding formula for @xmath12 , @xmath110\\left[\\frac{\\kappa_t^2}{d^2_{1q}}-\\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\kappa_t$ } } \\cdot({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\kappa_t$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k_t$}})}{d_{1q}d_{2q}}\\right]+\\frac{m_q^2}{d^2_{1q}}-\\frac{m_q^2 } { d_{1q}d_{2q}}\\right\\}f(x',k_t^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{offshellft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are defined by eqs .",

    "we have used the prescription proposed in @xcite . in order to regularise the integration over @xmath18",

    "the dominant contribution to @xmath0 is given by the photon - gluon fusion subprocess @xmath142 ( so the gluon distribution is the most important at low @xmath1 ) but the contributions from quarks have also been included with the modification @xmath143 for the lower limit of the integration over @xmath72 .",

    "we compare our results for massive and massless quarks . as can be observed the quark masses play an important role in the region of low @xmath2 .",
    "but even at moderate values of @xmath2 the difference is visible .",
    "this is because the on  shell model ( [ iq2],[iq3],[iq4 ] ) with masses contains the power correction term multiplied by the logarithmic factor , @xmath146 .",
    "note also that the difference between the on  shell and off  shell calculations is very small .",
    "in fig.3 we present @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 , with and without higher twist corrections .",
    "we have chosen the cut - off parameter @xmath102 to be @xmath147 , but there is no significant dependence on this quantity ( within the range of @xmath148 ) .",
    "higher twist gives higher values for @xmath0 , especially in the region where @xmath1 is not very small ( @xmath149 ) . on the other hand it gives lower values for small @xmath1 than the model without higher twist",
    "this is due to the fact that the contribution coming from low values of the quark momenta is now described by the soft pomeron exchange .",
    "the difference between these calculations decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "in fig.4 we present the results for the ratio @xmath150 together with slac @xcite parametrisation . for both parton sets ( grv and mrs(a ) ) the structure function @xmath106 has been calculated from the vmd model @xcite .",
    "we also observe the same effect as for the longitudinal structure function : the model with higher twist predicts bigger values for the ratio @xmath9 at high @xmath1 .    for intermediate values of @xmath2",
    "this model coincides with slac parametrisation , whereas for lower values of @xmath2 it vanishes quickly as @xmath92 .",
    "it should be noted that the difference between the parametrisations in the low @xmath2 region are not very large , they both decrease very fast with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the ratio @xmath9 and the structure function @xmath0 are not very sensitive to the differences in parton parametrisations in this region .",
    "because the slac model is not applicable in the low @xmath2 region , using it as an estimate of the ratio @xmath9 may cause significant errors .",
    "we have analysed the proton structure function @xmath0 in the low @xmath2 and low @xmath1 region .",
    "we have studied the off  shell formula which originates from the high energy factorization theorem and we have proved that in the limit when @xmath151 it reduces to the on  shell approximation .",
    "the numerical differences between these two approaches are not very significant .",
    "we have also studied the structure function @xmath0 in the very low @xmath2 region , where we have proposed the method of continuing the formulae for the structure functions down to @xmath69 .",
    "the non - zero values of quark masses have strong consequences in the structure function behaviour .",
    "both the off  shell and on  shell formulae contain power corrections connected with quark masses ( i.e. terms like @xmath152 ) .",
    "we have also proposed a model for the higher twist term which is based on the assumption that the contribution of quarks having limited transverse momenta is dominated by soft pomeron exchange .",
    "this results in change of the @xmath1 dependence of the structure function @xmath0 .",
    "we have also performed calculations for @xmath9 .",
    "the model for the ratio @xmath9 enables us to estimate this quantity in the low @xmath2 region .",
    "it is particularly important because the uncertainty in the ratio @xmath9 is the main source of systematic errors when extracting other structure functions from experimental data .",
