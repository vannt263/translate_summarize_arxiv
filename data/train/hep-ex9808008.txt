    "bottomonium dipion transitions have been the subject of many studies  @xcite .",
    "so far , theoretical efforts have concentrated on investigating dipion transitions between pairs of @xmath1 resonances below @xmath15 threshold production , in part because of complexities in the theoretical analysis of coupled - channel effects above @xmath15 threshold .",
    "there are no experimental results on @xmath16 dipion transitions ; one would generally expect very small branching fractions for such @xmath16 decays due to the large ozi - allowed width for @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless the large amount of cleo  ii  resonance data and our familiarity with the systematics of such transitions  @xcite make it worthwhile to perform a dedicated search for the transitions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we can also measure the cross - sections for the processes  and  by reconstructing the decay chains ,  with @xmath20 .",
    "these processes are important in determining the accuracy of theoretical calculations  @xcite and experimental measurements  @xcite of the cross - section for hadron production in @xmath21 annihilations at @xmath22 gev .",
    "the process @xmath23 comprises one of the largest systematic uncertainties to the measurement of @xmath24 in the @xmath1 region .",
    "the cleo  ii detector , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , is a general - purpose magnetic spectrometer and calorimeter for measuring charged and neutral particles .",
    "the major subsystems of the detector ( in order of increasing radius from the beam pipe ) are the central detector , time - of - flight scintillators , the crystal calorimeter , 1.5-tesla superconducting coil , and the muon chambers and magnetic flux return units .",
    "the central detector consists of three concentric drift chambers and is used for reconstruction of charged particle momenta and measurements of specific ionization energy loss ( @xmath25 ) for particle identification .",
    "this system achieves a momentum resolution @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the momentum in gev/@xmath28 , and covers 95% of the solid angle .",
    "the time - of - flight system is used in two ways : for the lower - level trigger , and for measuring the flight time of particles to help in particle identification .",
    "the crystal calorimeter , which measures the energies deposited by neutral and charged particles , consists of 7800 thallium - doped cesium iodide ( csi ) crystals arranged in a barrel and two endcaps .",
    "the central barrel region of the calorimeter covers 75% of the solid angle and achieves an energy resolution @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "the endcaps extend the solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath31 , although they provide poorer energy resolution than the barrel region .",
    "the muon identification system , also arranged as an octagonal barrel and two endcaps , uses proportional tracking chambers for muon detection .",
    "these chambers are sandwiched between and behind the iron slabs that provide the magnetic field flux return .    in our analysis",
    "the jetset  @xcite program is used as a monte carlo event generator .",
    "we use a geant  @xcite based detector simulation package to propagate and decay the final state particles in the cleo  ii detector .",
    "in our analysis of  transitions ] we reconstruct the @xmath32 exclusively from the decays . the following selection criteria are common to all five transitions : ( 1 ) we require a total of four good quality primary charged tracks in the event with zero net charge ; ( 2 ) two of them ( the lepton candidates ) must have momenta greater than 3.5 gev/@xmath28 and originate from the interaction region , defined as a cylindrical volume of 3 mm radius and 10 cm length aligned along the beam axis and centered on the @xmath21 collision point ; ( 3 ) the other two tracks ( the pion candidates ) must have momenta less than 1 gev/@xmath28 and originate from a similar cylindrical volume 4 mm @xmath33 12 cm centered on the interaction point ; ( 4 ) we identify electrons by requiring the ratio of the associated electromagnetic shower energy deposited in the calorimeter to the momentum of the matching track to be close to unity and the lateral pattern of energy deposition to be consistent with the electron hypothesis ; ( 5 ) muons are identified by requiring the maximum penetration depth of the muon track candidate into the muon system absorber to be greater than three hadronic absorption lengths ; ( 6 ) we require the cosine of the opening angle between the pion tracks to satisfy @xmath34 to suppress background from @xmath35 events with @xmath36-conversion when the resulting @xmath21 pair fakes a @xmath37 pair ; and ( 7 ) to further reduce this background in the @xmath38 channel ( only ) we require that at least one of the pion candidates must have its specific ionization energy loss measurement ( @xmath25 ) consistent with the pion hypothesis .",
    "we search for a signal from the transitions of interest by plotting the invariant mass of the @xmath39 system vs the mass recoiling against the dipion system @xmath40 as shown in figure  [ fig : g2pi2ldtscat ] : the upper plots are for @xmath2 gev and the lower plots are for @xmath3 gev ( the boxes denote our signal regions ) .",
    "peaks from the @xmath41 and @xmath42 transitions are clearly seen in all four distributions .",
    "one can also notice a much smaller signal from the @xmath43 transition in the @xmath44 channel .",
    "this signal is not seen in the @xmath38 channel because of a cutoff in @xmath45 due to the absence of @xmath25 information for tracks with momentum less than ; such tracks do not reach into the outer drift chamber where the @xmath25 measurement is performed .    because the transitions @xmath43 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 occur in events with initial state radiation , the peak of the recoil mass for these transitions is shifted from the mass value of the daughter @xmath1 by roughly @xmath46 , the energy of the unobserved initial state radiation photon ( table  [ tab : enshift ] ) .",
    ".the initial state radiation photon energies and the recoil mass peak positions for @xmath47 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have performed a search for the dipion transitions between the @xmath1 resonances at the center of mass energies on and below the @xmath16 .",
    "we set 90% confidence level upper limits on the branching fractions of the @xmath16 dipion transitions : @xmath4 and @xmath5 . by observing the transitions @xmath6 and @xmath8 ,",
    "we have measured the cross - sections for the radiative processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for the process",
    "@xmath10 our results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions , while for the process @xmath9 our measured values are somewhat below the predictions ( table  [ tab : predict ] ) .",
