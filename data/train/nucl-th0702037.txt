    "the skyrme model is considered as the low energy limit of the quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) , it models qcd in the classical or large number of colors ( @xmath1 ) limit and baryon is regarded as the soliton in the pion field @xcite . upon quantizing a slowly rotating skyrmion , static property of nucleons and @xmath2 have been calculated with the results in agreement with experimental data within 30% @xcite .",
    "recently it has been widely used to discuss the exotic hadrons @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the model consists of the following lagrangian terms : the non - linear sigma term with chiral order @xmath3 and the skyrme term with @xmath4 .",
    "even though the minimal version of skyrme model ( min - skm ) can be regarded as a successful phenomenological model in spite of its simplicity , it can not be used to study the problem of quark spin contents of proton or emc effects @xcite which are important qcd effects in baryon physics .",
    "this is a very unsatisfied defect for min - skm . in order to cure this disease , additional terms with @xmath5 or high orders have to be added into the model s lagrangian to construct modified skyrme models . among them ,",
    "the simplest one is the model with the min - skm lagrangian plus only one additional @xmath6 term @xcite , where @xmath7 is the baryon current ( or goldstone - wilczek current ) .",
    "hereafter , we shortly call this simplest modified skyrme model as mod - skm .",
    "it is expected that the mod - skm should be more realistic than min - skm .",
    "to discuss this issue , and to fix the parameters in mod - skm is one of the aims of this paper .",
    "moreover the mod - skm can be obtained by considering the infinite @xmath8 mass limit of the vector meson @xmath8 term of the chiral lagrangian studied in ref @xcite .",
    "an interesting application of the skyrme model is the investigation of the baryon - baryon interaction , especially the nucleon - nucleon(@xmath9 ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the skyrme picture gives us a qualitative understanding of the principal features of the @xmath9 interaction : it has the correct long - range one pion exchange potential which dominates the tensor force .",
    "there is a strong short range repulsion , and finally there is a pronounced central attraction at intermediate range , albeit weakly attractive while comparing with the phenomenological potential .",
    "however , the recent development of obtaining the @xmath9 interaction from the skyrme model has shown that the combined effect of the careful treatment of the nonlinear equations and the configuration mixing is to give substantial central midrange attraction for the @xmath9 system that is in qualitative agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 potentials have been investigated by means of the min - skm and the algebraic methods in ref .",
    "the phenomenon and puzzles in the baryon - antibaryon physics have attracted much attention recently due to the remarkable discovery of baryon - antibaryon enhancements in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 interaction and the possible nucleon - antinucleon bound states have been investigated from the constituent quark model @xcite . in the skyrme model ,",
    "the interactions between classical skyrmion and antiskyrmion , i.e. , @xmath13 , were explored in @xcite . in the present paper , we shall study the @xmath14 potential using the mod - skm and following the methods developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that phenomenologically the @xmath10 potential is not as well established as the @xmath9 potential . at distance less than about 1 fermi",
    "the interaction is dominated by annihilation . however , at larger distance , a meaningful potential can be defined and studied either by @xmath15 parity transformation on the @xmath9 meson exchange potential or phenomenologically .",
    "we will compare our mod - skm s results to some phenomenological potentials .",
    "the @xmath0 term in mod - skm reflects the effect of @xmath8 meson exchange @xcite .",
    "we will see that at large distance , where the product ansatz makes the best sense , the potentials based on the skyrme model agree qualitatively and , in most cases , quantitatively with the phenomenological interactions . at intermediate and short distance , we do less well , but at these distances the product ansatz is not valid . however , the results are still suggestive .    in the following section , we give the mod - skm s lagrangian , then reproduce a number of static properties of single baryon which is both qualitatively appealing and quantitatively satisfactory . in sec.iii",
    "we study the skyrmion - antiskyrmion interaction in mod - skm , and project them to the nucleon space by the algebraic methods @xcite .",
    "we also consider the effects of rotational excitations by including intermediate states @xmath2 and @xmath16 , and evaluate the corrections to the @xmath10 potential in perturbation theory .",
    "sec.iv closes this paper with some discussions related to the present study .",
    "the skyrme model lagrangian is generalized to include additional @xmath0 term which simulates the effects of @xmath8 meson , and this modified skyrme model lagrangian provides a better description of both the single baryon static properties and the low energy @xmath9 interaction @xcite .",

    "in traditional nuclear interaction theories within the potential framework which are based on the single meson exchange mainly , it is shown that @xmath10 system is more attractive than the @xmath9 system due to the fact that in the theories there is a strong @xmath8 exchange , so inclusion of this term which models the effect of the @xmath8 meson could help in a better description of the @xmath31 system .",
    "furthermore , the study of the quark spin content also support that we should add this six derivative term in order to yield a spin content consistent with the present experiment @xcite .",
