    "m82 is one of the nearest and brightest starburst galaxies .",
    "located at a distance of 3.9  mpc , and with a luminosity of 3.7@xmath1210@xmath13  l@xmath14 , it has been extensively studied in many molecules .",
    "compared to other prototypical nearby starburst galaxies like ngc  253 and ic  342 , m82 presents systematically low abundances of the molecules nh@xmath1 , ch@xmath1oh , ch@xmath1cn , hnco and sio @xcite .",
    "different explanations have been proposed to account for this peculiar chemistry . since",
    "all these molecules are related to dust grain chemistry , @xcite proposed that the formation of molecules on dust and/or evaporation to the gas phase is not efficient in m82 .    on the other hand",
    ", several studies have revealed that the starburst has heavily influenced the interstellar medium in m82 by producing high cosmic rays and uv fluxes .",
    "a low density ionized component is filling a substantial fraction of the volume in m82 ( see e.g seaquist et al .",
    "the molecular gas is embedded in this component in the form of warm ( t@xmath15@xmath1650 k ) and dense ( @xmath17@xmath1610@xmath8 @xmath10 ) clouds @xcite .",
    "dense pdrs are expected to form in the borders of these clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite have modeled the cii , siii and oi emission and estimated a uv field of g@xmath11=10@xmath8 in units of the habing field and a density of @xmath17@xmath310@xmath9 @xmath10 for the atomic component .",
    "@xcite reported observations of the ci ( @xmath18p@xmath19-@xmath18p@xmath11 ) line deriving a [ ci]/co column density ratio ( @xmath3 0.5 ) higher than that observed in non - starburst galaxies ( e.g. [ ci]/co @xmath3 0.15 in our galaxy ) .",
    "they proposed that the enhanced cosmic ray flux supplied by supernova remnants could produce the enhanced ci emission in m82 .",
    "recent results suggest that the strong uv flux dominates the chemistry of the molecular gas in m82 . @xcite",
    "obtained a high - angular - resolution image showing widespread hco emission in this galaxy . the enhanced hco abundance ( [ hco]/[h@xmath5co@xmath2]@xmath33.6 ) measured across the whole m82 disk was interpreted in terms of a giant pdr of 650 pc size .",
    "in this paper , we present observations of a selected set of radicals ( cn , c@xmath0h ) , reactive ions ( co@xmath2 , hoc@xmath2 ) and small hydrocarbons ( c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 ) which are excellent probes of the atomic to molecular transition in pdrs .",
    "in particular , the [ cn]/[hcn ] ratio has been successfully used as a pdr indicator in regions with very different physical conditions in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the detection of the reactive ion hoc@xmath2 is almost unambiguously associated to regions with a high ionizing flux , either pdrs or xdrs @xcite .",
    "recent works have revealed that the abundances of some hydrocarbons , such as c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 and c@xmath20h , are an order of magnitude larger in pdrs than those predicted by gas - phase models @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in june and november 2004 with the iram 30 m radiotelescope at pico de veleta ( spain ) .",
    "we used 2 sis receivers tuned in single - sideband mode in the 1 mm and 3 mm bands .",
    "the observed transitions are : cn 1@xmath40 ( 113.490 ghz ) , cn 2@xmath41 ( 226.874 ghz ) , hcn 1@xmath40 ( 88.631 ghz ) , c@xmath0h 1@xmath40 ( 87.317 and 87.402 ghz ) , c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 2@xmath21@xmath41@xmath22 ( 85.339 ghz ) , c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 6@xmath23@xmath45@xmath24 ( 217.822 ghz ) , ch@xmath1c@xmath0h 5@xmath15@xmath44@xmath15 ( 85.457 ghz ) , hc@xmath1n",

    "the line intensities have been scaled to the main beam brightness temperature .",
    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the telescope is 29@xmath25 at 85 ghz , 22@xmath25 at 115 ghz and 12@xmath25 at 230 ghz .",
    "we observed three positions across the m82 disk : the nucleus ( ra(2000 ) : 09@xmath2655@xmath2751.9@xmath28 , dec(2000 ) : 69@xmath294@xmath3047.11@xmath25 ) and the two peaks in the hco emission [ offsets ( @xmath3114@xmath25,@xmath315@xmath25 ) and ( @xmath3214@xmath25,@xmath325@xmath25 ) hereafter referred to as e. and w. knot respectively ] .",
    "the observed spectra are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "to compare the 1.3 mm and 3 mm cn and c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 lines and make excitation calculations , we have derived beam filling factors from the h@xmath5co@xmath2 interferometric image of @xcite . this assumption is justified since h@xmath5co@xmath2 is an optically thin tracer of dense gas ( n@xmath16 10@xmath8 @xmath10 ) and presents a quite uniform abundance in a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "the ch@xmath1c@xmath0h and c@xmath0h column densities have been estimated using the lte approximation . for c@xmath0h , we have assumed the typical rotation temperature in galactic pdrs , t@xmath33 = 10 k @xcite . in the case of ch@xmath1c@xmath0h ,",
    "all the lines of the k - ladder are blended . in our estimates , we have assumed that 40% of the emission comes from the k=0 line and t@xmath33= 20 k. these assumptions are based on the ch@xmath1c@xmath0h observations of sgr b2 and orion which have similar physical conditions to m82 @xcite .",
    "an lvg code has been used to derive densities and beam averaged column densities for the other species . in these calculations , we have assumed t@xmath15=60 k inferred from the nh@xmath1 lines by @xcite .",

    "@xmath10 , we have calculated the column densities averaged in a beam of 29@xmath25 .",
    "the cn and hcn column densities are quite constant along the galaxy disk with values , n(cn)=2.0@xmath360.5@xmath1210@xmath37  @xmath38 and n(hcn)=4.0@xmath360.5@xmath1210@xmath5 @xmath38 .",
    "the [ cn]/[hcn ] ratio is similar to 5 in all positions ( see table 1 ) . as discussed in section 4",

    "the derived c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 and ch@xmath1c@xmath0h column densities are also quite uniform along the disk with values , n(c@xmath1h@xmath0)@xmath31.7@xmath360.4@xmath1210@xmath5 @xmath38 and n(ch@xmath1c@xmath0h)@xmath31.0@xmath360.6@xmath1210@xmath37 @xmath38 .",

    "the derived lower limit to the [ c - c@xmath1h@xmath0]/[hc@xmath1n ] ratio argue in favor of a pdr chemistry in m82 .",
    "we have detected the reactive ion hoc@xmath2 in the three selected positions across the m82 disk .",
    "furthermore , the intensities of the hoc@xmath2  1@xmath40 lines are similar , even larger , than those of the h@xmath5co@xmath2  1@xmath40 lines . assuming the same physical conditions for h@xmath5co@xmath2 and hoc@xmath2",
    ", we derive a [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2 ] ratio of @xmath340 across the 650 pc inner disk , which is two orders of magnitude lower than that found in galactic giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) @xcite .",
    "however , the h@xmath5co@xmath2 spectra are derived from interferometric data . in order to asses the amount of missed flux ( and hence the h@xmath5co@xmath2 column density ) , we have compared our results to those of hco@xmath2 from @xcite , which were obtained by single - dish observations . from our h@xmath5co@xmath2 spectra ,",
    "we obtain n(h@xmath5co@xmath2)@xmath35@xmath1210@xmath41  @xmath38 across the galaxy . assuming a @xmath39c/@xmath5c ratio of 89 , this implies",

    "this value is in agreement within a factor of 1.5 with previous estimate by @xcite .",
    "thus , even in the most conservative case we can conclude that the [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2 ] ratio is @xmath7 80 in the m82 disk .",
    "such low values of the [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2 ] ratio have only been found in the galactic reflection nebula ngc  7023 @xcite and in the active nucleus of ngc  1068 @xcite and put severe constraints to the ionization degree of the molecular gas in m82 .",
    "@xcite found from detailed modeling that [ cn]/[hcn]@xmath161 arises naturally in the surface layers ( a@xmath42@xmath74 mag ) of dense pdrs .",
    "values of the [ cn]/[hcn ] ratio between 13 have been found in prototypical dense galactic pdrs @xcite .",
    "we have derived [ cn]/[hcn ] ratios @xmath35 in all positions across the m82 nucleus suggesting that the molecular clouds in this galaxy are bathed in an intense uv field . to determine the averaged physical conditions of these clouds , we have carried out model calculations using the plane - parallel pdr model developed by le bourlot and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the model includes 135 species ( hoc@xmath2 , ch@xmath1c@xmath0h and hc@xmath1n are not included ) and standard gas - phase reactions . adopting g@xmath11@xmath310@xmath8 @xcite and a total hydrogen nuclei density @xmath43=4@xmath1210@xmath9  @xmath10",
    ", the model predicts that [ cn]/[hcn ] ratios @xmath445 are only expected in regions at a@xmath42@xmath756 mag ( see left panels of fig .",
    "2 ) . this implies an important limit to the cloud sizes in the nucleus of m82 .",
    "since the clouds are bathed in a pervasive uv field , the averaged column density of individual clouds should be @xmath45@xmath310@xmath46 @xmath38 in order to have averaged [ cn]/[hcn ] ratios @xmath35 .",
    "strong constraints are also derived from the hoc@xmath2 observations .",
    "we have measured a [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2 ] ratio of @xmath3 40 in the m82 disk .",
    "a simple calculation of the co@xmath2/hco@xmath2/hoc@xmath2 chemical network shows that a high ionization degree , x(e@xmath47)@xmath16 10@xmath48 , is required to have [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2]@xmath780 @xcite .",
    "our pdr model shows that this high electron abundance is only found at a@xmath42@xmath74  mag ( see left panels of fig .",
    "this implies that the averaged column density of the clouds in the nucleus of m82 is n(h@xmath0)@xmath78@xmath1210@xmath49  @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the m82 nucleus seems to be formed by small ( r@xmath30.02 - 0.2 pc ) and dense ( n@xmath310@xmath810@xmath9  @xmath10 ) clouds immersed in a uv field of g@xmath11@xmath310@xmath8 . @xcite",
    "estimated similar column densities for the clouds in the inner 400 pc disk of m82 by modeling of the @xmath39co , @xmath5co and c@xmath50o lines .",
    "low values of the [ hco@xmath2]/[hoc@xmath2 ] ratio are also found in xdrs with high ionization degree , such us active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite . however , the pah emission is very low in agns since the doubly ionized pahs produced by x - rays are very unstable @xcite .",
    "the intense pah emission observed in m82 @xcite indicates that x - rays are not the driving agent of the molecular gas chemistry in this galaxy .",
    "the hydrocarbon chemistry in pdrs has been a subject of increasing interest both from the theoretical and the observational point of view .",
    "recent works have revealed that the c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 abundance in pdrs is similar to that in dark clouds .",
    "this is quite surprising taking into account that this carbon cycle is easily photodissociated .",
    "in fact , pdr gas - phase models fall short of explaining the observed c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 and c@xmath20h abundances by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen when one compares the [ c - c@xmath1h@xmath0]/[hc@xmath1n ] ratio in pdrs and dark clouds ( see table 1 ) .",
    "while both species have similar abundances in dark clouds , the [ c - c@xmath1h@xmath0]/[hc@xmath1n ] ratio is @xmath1610 in pdrs .",
    "since both molecules are easily destroyed by photodissociation , this suggests the existence of an additional c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 formation mechanism in pdrs .",
    "several authors have proposed formation processes of small hydrocarbons linked to the pahs chemistry @xcite .",
    "we have detected widespread emission of c@xmath0h and c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 in the m82 disk .",
    "however , we have not detected hc@xmath1n towards any position . the derived upper limits to the hc@xmath1n column density in m82 show that the [ c - c@xmath1h@xmath0]/[hc@xmath1n ] ratio is at least a factor of 10 larger in this starburst galaxy than in the prototypical galactic dark cloud tmc  1 , and is similar to that found in dense galactic pdrs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this result reinforces the scenario where the inner 650 pc region of m82 is a giant pdr .",
    "in addition to c@xmath0h and c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 , we have detected ch@xmath1c@xmath0h in all the positions across the m82 disk .",
    "this detection is rather puzzling since this molecule is easily photodissociated in regions exposed to intense uv fields and therefore its abundance is expected to be very low in these regions .",
    "furthermore , this molecule is not detected in prototypical galactic pdrs , like the horsehead , which is known to be specially rich in carbon compounds @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the ch@xmath1c@xmath0h emission arises in a population of clouds similar to the galactic gmcs .",
    "the molecule ch@xmath1c@xmath0h is quite abundant in gmcs , presenting similar abundances to those of chemically related species like ch@xmath1oh and ch@xmath1cn .",
    "the same behavior is observed in other prototypical starburst galaxies like ngc 253 where [ ch@xmath1c@xmath0h]/[ch@xmath1oh]@xmath31 and [ ch@xmath1c@xmath0h]/[ch@xmath1cn@xmath51\\sim$]8 .",
    "however , [ ch@xmath1c@xmath0h]/[ch@xmath1oh]@xmath168 and [ ch@xmath1c@xmath0h]/[ch@xmath1cn]@xmath1625 in m82 @xcite , i.e. , a factor 310 larger than in ngc 253 .",
    "these abundance ratios show that the hydrocarbon chemistry in m82 is very different from that of gmcs .",
    "_ we think that the over - abundance of ch@xmath1c@xmath0h is also related to the enhanced uv flux in this galaxy .",
    "_ in fact , ch@xmath1c@xmath0h and ch@xmath1c@xmath20h has been detected by @xcite in the c - rich proto - planetary nebula crl 618 .",
    "this nebula is specially rich in complex carbon compounds , in particular , polyynes ( c@xmath52h@xmath0 ) and methylpolyynes ( ch@xmath1c@xmath53h ) .",
    "they argued that the formation of these complex molecules has started by the photolysis of acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) and methane ( ch@xmath20 ) , both processes occurring in the inner pdr of the planetary nebula .",
    "the photo - erosion of pahs could also contribute to enhance the abundance of these molecules by releasing small carbon chains and acetylene to the gas phase .",
    "the observations presented in this paper show that the strong uv flux drives the chemistry of the molecular gas in the m82 disk . in this letter , we explore whether the pdr chemistry can solely account for all the molecular abundances measured in this galaxy so far . for this aim , we compare the molecular abundances in m82 to those of the prototypical starburst ngc 253 .",
    "molecules such as nh@xmath1 , ch@xmath1oh , ch@xmath1cn , so , sio and hc@xmath1n are clearly under - abundant in m82 compared to ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "all these molecules are easily photodissociated and are not expected in a pdr .",
    "other species such as cs , cn , hcn and hco@xmath2 present fractional abundances @xmath3 a few 10@xmath54 in m82 which are very similar to those measured in ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "these molecules belong to the reduced group of species which have significant abundances at a@xmath42@xmath75 mag in our pdr model ( see left panels of fig .",
    "2 ) . however , our model predicts abundances a factor of 10 lower than those observed .",
    "cosmic rays and/or shocks could contribute to enhance the abundances of these species .    to investigate the possible effect of the enhanced cosmic ray flux on the chemistry",
    ", we have repeated the model calculations with an enhanced cosmic rays flux of @xmath55=4@xmath1210@xmath56  s@xmath57 .",
    "this is the value estimated by @xcite to account for the physical conditions of the molecular gas in m82 and is , very likely , an upper limit to the actual cosmic ray flux .",
    "the enhanced cosmic rays flux does not change significantly the value of the [ cn]/[hcn ] ratio and the ionization degree at a@xmath42@xmath75  mag ( see right panels of fig .",
    "2 ) . however , the fractional abundances of hcn , cn and cs averaged over the region at a@xmath42@xmath75  mag are a factor of 10 larger than those obtained with the standard value @xmath55=5@xmath1210@xmath58  s@xmath57 . moreover , these values are in reasonable agreement with the observational results in m82 .",
    "thus , by including the enhanced cosmic ray flux we get a better fit of the model to the observational results . however , the hco@xmath2 abundance still remains a factor of 10 lower than the observed one .",
    "some of the underabundant species in m82 like sio are well known shock chemistry tracers .",
    "this suggests that shocks are not the dominant mechanism at work in the galaxy disk .",
    "the sio map reported by @xcite show that shocks are not occurring in the galaxy disk but in the disk - halo interface because of the hot gas coming out of the plane in the nucleus of m82 .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of m82 as an evolved starburst compared to ngc 253 .",
    "while in ngc 253 the molecular chemistry is determined by the shocks associated with the early stages of star formation , in m82 it is determined by the uv radiation produced by evolved stars and the enhanced cosmic rays flux @xcite .",
