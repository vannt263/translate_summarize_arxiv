    "at @xmath9 , cluster galaxies have significant ongoing star formation @xcite .",
    "the presence of emission lines in cluster galaxies at @xmath10 provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of environment on emission line scaling relations .",
    "galaxy properties in the local universe depend strongly on environment , e.g. stellar mass , gas fraction , morphology , and star formation rate ( sfr ) @xcite . however , at @xmath0 little evidence for environmental effects on sfr and the mass - metallicity relation @xcite and minor effects on size @xcite have been observed .",
    "kinematics and dynamical masses , which probe more fundamental properties of galaxies , so far have not been tested in cluster environments at @xmath10 .",
    "kinematic scaling relations track how mass and luminosity are correlated and can be interpreted in terms of stellar mass and dynamical ( total ) mass .",
    "studies of local emission line scaling relations , like the tully - fisher relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tfr ) , find that cluster and field populations follow the same trends @xcite .",
    "it is unknown if environment is correlated with kinematics at higher redshifts , as few clusters have been confirmed at @xmath10 .",
    "observations of field galaxies show that stellar - mass scaling relations stay relatively consistent with local measurements until @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "some observations also suggest that these relations evolve at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is possibly because gas fractions are higher at these redshifts , as supported by recent observations @xcite and predicted by simulations @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether cluster galaxies follow the same trends as the field , or if they evolve at higher redshift .",
    "as such , offsets in kinematics between cluster and field galaxies could indicate different evolutionary states in denser environments , e.g. the increasing fraction with redshift of post - starburst galaxies in clusters that span a range of velocity dispersions ( tran et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "observations have shown that kinematics for both resolved and unresolved objects can be tracked using integrated velocity dispersion , @xmath13 , measured with emission lines such as h@xmath5  ( for a review of kinematic surveys using this technique , see @xcite ) . here",
    "we present the most distant study yet to compare h@xmath5  kinematics of individual cluster galaxies and field galaxies .",
    "our data consists of objects measured by the zfire survey @xcite , including the @xmath4 overdense region in the cosmos field @xcite .",

    "examples of candels/3d - hst imaging of galaxies in our sample can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "we generate a custom pipeline to fit the 161 cosmos galaxies in zfire with f160w imaging using initial measurements of size , axis ratio ( @xmath19 ) , position angle ( pa ) , and magnitude from sextractor @xcite .",
    "our constraints are adopted from the constraints in @xcite , and our point - spread function is constructed by 3d - hst .",
    "objects within 2@xmath20 of a target galaxy are simultaneously fit with the central object .",
    "residual images are visually inspected to determine the best possible fits for each galaxy .",
    "galaxies with poor residuals are refit using a different set of initial parameters , and rejected if a satisfactory solution can not be obtained .",
    "our results are consistent within @xmath21 to @xcite .",
    "errors for our galfit measurements are obtained by adding sky noise to the galfit model , and rerunning galfit 200 times per object .",
    "the range of the error is obtained from the 1@xmath22 confidence intervals .",
    "the size of the galaxy is obtained using @xmath19 and the effective radius , @xmath23 , from galfit .",
    "we convert this to a circularized effective radius using @xmath24 .",
    "the properties of our overall population show no significant size dependence on environment .",
    "this is in conflict with @xcite who find evidence that star - forming galaxies in the cluster are larger than in the field .",
    "however , we stress that this is likely because our analysis is limited to the smaller set of h@xmath5@xmath7detected galaxies .",
    "the cosmos cluster was initially identified by @xcite using photometric redshifts from zfourge @xcite and subsequently confirmed with spectroscopic redshifts from mosfire @xcite .",
    "zfourge combines broad - band imaging in k and the medium - band j@xmath25 , j@xmath26 , j@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , and h@xmath29 filters to select objects using ks - band images with a 5@xmath22 limit of 25.3 ab magnitudes .",
    "zfourge uses fast @xcite to fit stellar population synthesis models to the galaxy spectral energy distributions to estimate observed galaxy properties .",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function with constant solar metallicity and an exponentially declining star formation rate , and a @xcite dust law .",
    "observations were taken in december 2013 and february 2014 in the k - band filter covering 1.93 - 2.45 @xmath30 m , the wavelength range we would expect to see h@xmath5  and [ ] at the cluster redshift .",
    "targets were star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) selected from rest frame uvj colors . seeing varied from @xmath31 to @xmath32 over the course of our observations .",
    "the spectra are flat - fielded , wavelength calibrated , and sky subtracted using the mosfire data reduction pipeline ( drp ) .",
    "we use a custom zfire pipeline to correct for telluric absorption and perform a spectrophotometric flux calibration using a type a0v standard star .",
    "we flux calibrate our objects to the continuum of the standard star , and use zfourge photometry to correct offsets between photometric and spectroscopic magnitudes .",
    "the final result of the drp are flux - calibrated 2d spectra ( see examples in figure 1 ) and 2d 1@xmath22 images used for error analysis , with a bootstrapped flux calibration error of @xmath33 ( @xmath340.08 magnitudes ) . for more information on zfire spectroscopic data reduction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we extract 1d spectra from an aperture the width of the one gaussian sigma ( @xmath35 ) boundaries of the spatial h@xmath5  emission - line profile .",
    "varying the aperture width does not affect our results .",
    "the 1d h@xmath5  line width is determined by fitting a gaussian profile to the h@xmath5  emission line .",
    "we subtract the measured instrumental broadening in quadrature from the line width , and convert the corrected line width to @xmath6  using the best - fit redshift from @xcite .",
    "errors are calculated by adding sky noise to the observed spectrum , and refitting 1000 times .",
    "we test if slit misalignment affects our results . after rejecting objects with @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 , where @xmath36 is the difference between the galfit - measured pa and the angle of the slit",
    ", our sample decreases to 26 objects overall , 7 in the cluster .",
    "however , our results do not significantly change , so we conclude the slit misalignment does not significantly affect our final results for our scaling relations or virial mass measurements and do not include galaxy pa corrections or restrictions in our analysis .",
    "all gaussian line fits are visually inspected .",
    "emission lines with sky contamination are given a lower quality flag than emission lines without contamination , but are included in our sample ( figure 2 ) .",
    "measurements with signatures of agn as detected in @xcite , objects completely obscured by sky emission , or objects too faint to detect manually are excluded from our analysis . after our rejection criteria ,",
    "the sample contains 75 cosmos galaxies , 28 of which are associated with the @xmath0 cluster .",
    "the cluster objects are defined as objects identified with three strongly overdense regions of the cosmos field . in @xcite ,",
    "these overdensities are found by computing surface density maps . in @xcite , these objects are spectroscopically confirmed and concentrated at @xmath39 , and are consistent with a gaussian distribution with @xmath40 .",
    "the redshift range for the cluster is defined to be @xmath41 .",
    "the cosmos overdensity velocity dispersion is measured to be @xmath42 km s@xmath8 , and has 57 spectroscopically confirmed members .",
    "it consists of four major groups that cover a total projected size of @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 ( @xmath45 mpc@xmath44 comoving ) .",
    "the cluster is most likely to evolve into a virgo - like cluster at @xmath46 ( from @xmath14cdm simulations , see * ? ? ?",
    "field objects are defined as targetted objects not within the cluster redshift range or associated spatially with the cluster .",
    "by measuring kinematics from the h@xmath5  line width , we assume that the broadening is caused by the gravitational potential of the galaxy acting on the gas .",
    "we also use @xmath6  since it can be measured for all galaxies , even those with unresolved rotation , and is robust against psf effects .",
    "@xmath6  could trace rotation , velocity dispersion , or a combination of both quantities @xcite .",
    "integrated velocity dispersions of zfire cosmos galaxies range from @xmath3450 - 230 km s@xmath8 , an expected distribution of values for extended ( rather than compact ) sfgs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the median @xmath6  is 72.8 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we determine a linear least - squares fit to the cluster , field , and total zfire samples ( table 1 ) normalized at log(m@xmath1)=10 .",
    "the least - square linear fits relation is of the form log@xmath47 = @xmath48(log@xmath49 - 10 ) + @xmath50 .",
    "the best - fit relation is bootstrapped 1000 times to determine 1@xmath22 confidence intervals of the linear fit .",
    "the best - fit log(m@xmath1)-log(@xmath6 ) relations for cluster ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) and field ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) are consistent within 1@xmath22 ( table 1 ) , indicating no evidence of environmental influence on kinematics .",
    "the median residual of the points around each best - fit line is @xmath55 dex , and cluster and field relations overlap within this scatter .",
    "our results do not depend on whether or not we apply weighting from our errors on @xmath6 .    to quantify our ability to recover 1d line widths , we use a set of 2d emission - line models with exponential disks , an arctan rotation profile , and known @xmath56 and gas @xmath22 .",
    "we add sky noise ( as measured from our data ) to the modeled galaxies , and collapse each emission line ( simulated and with sky noise ) to 1d line widths .",
    "we find that the simulated emission lines with noise differ by only @xmath340.01% compared to the input models .",
    "we confirm that our results on cluster versus field do not depend on inclination corrections . to correct for inclination , @xcite and @xcite assume that the intrinsic axis ratio is @xmath57 .",
    "when we apply this correction , the scatter of our points around our best - fit values decreases by @xmath58 dex and the values are offset from the uncorrected values by @xmath59 dex .",
    "if we do not correct for inclination , we tend to underestimate the input virial mass of our modeled galaxies by @xmath60 dex .",
    "however , this assumes that the models accurately represent the true galaxy kinematics .",
    "because an inclination correction does require assuming an intrinsic axis ratio and applying an inclination correction does not change our overall results , we use uncorrected @xmath6  values so that we can compare directly to recent results by @xcite .",
    "we will explore the effects of inclination corrections in future work .        in the right panel of figure 1",
    "we compare the zfire sample to the 1d field objects of @xcite , the 1d field objects of @xcite , and the 2d integral field unit ( ifu ) field objects of the spectroscopic imaging survey in the nir with sinfoni sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "we see consistent values of @xmath6  with sfgs in these samples . we also have compared our emission - line kinematics with the independent analysis of zfire spectra presented by @xcite , and find consistent 1d line widths with their collapsed best - fit 2d kinematic models .      in figure 3",
    "we compare estimated virial mass to stellar mass for the cosmos field and cluster objects and to other high - redshift kinematic surveys . while stellar mass can be estimated by spectral energy distribution fitting , which examines stellar populations and colors , virial mass accounts for the total mass of the galaxy including gas and dark matter .    to calculate virial mass",
    ", we apply the virial formula @xmath61 for comparison to recent results by @xcite , we assume a virial factor k@xmath62 . we find that our virial masses are consistent with these existing studies and @xcite .",
    "our linear best - fit relations for the cluster and field ( table 1 ) shows no significant environmental impact on our fits : cluster and field relations differ by @xmath63 .    in our anaysis",
    ", we use a constant virial factor but note that @xmath64 depends on the structural parameters of the galaxy .",
    "values in the literature range from @xmath65 and using , @xmath66 k@xmath67 from @xcite will introduce an offset of @xmath68 dex in our results .",
