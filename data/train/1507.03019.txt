    "the influence of bcg - hosted active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on their surroundings ( `` agn feedback '' ) persists long after the bcgs formation and ( major ) growth .",
    "understanding the nuclear activity of these galaxies in relation to the wider cluster environment is therefore important .",
    "this has important ramifications not only within cluster dynamics and bcg evolution but for comprehending agn feedback processes globally .",
    "the radiative cooling time at cluster centres is often much less than the hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gives an expected cooling rate of 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 , giving an expected sink of cold material on the order of a few 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath3 .",
    "however , only @xmath71 - 10% of this amount is observed - the classical ` cooling - flow problem ' @xcite . star formation is seen in cooling clusters although typically only at the level required to account for a few percent of gas cooling @xcite .",
    "similarly , much less cold molecular gas is observed than if cooling dominated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally there is a deficit of gas seen at intermediate cooling temperatures ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the central gas temperature fails to cool below @xmath730 - 40% of the ambient temperature at greater radii @xcite .",
    "the agn action of the bcg is believed to counteract the expected cooling ( for reviews see : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this agn feedback is also used to explain the high mass trunctation of the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bcg - hosted agn typically accrete inefficiently , hence their mode of feedback is via ` maintenance - mode ' ( also called ` low - excitation ' , ` radio - mode ' ) rather than ` quasar - mode ' ( also ` high - excitation ' ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "mechanical heating is the favoured method by which energy is coupled from the agn to the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "evidence for this agn feedback is most readily observable through the inflation of cavities by relativistic jets , in the x - ray emitting plasma of many massive clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these cavities , which are often co - spatial with extended radio emission , subsequently rise buoyantly increasing cluster entropy and re - distributing energy",
    ". detailed studies of local systems have shown that weak shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and density sound - waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contribute towards energising the icm , though they can not provide enough energy in all systems @xcite .",
    "observations of large - scale , low surface brightness structures such as radio mini - haloes around some bcgs suggest that cosmic rays may also play a role @xcite .",
    "agn energy from bcgs is sufficient to counteract runaway cooling in cluster cores globally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this is not always the case for individual sources and the details of the agn activity cycle and fuelling are uncertain . often , direct observations of mechanical effects are observationally infeasible thus requiring proxy measures of agn power .",
    "radio power correlates with mechanical power for statistical samples , albeit with large scatter @xcite . however , both the ratio ` k ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of non - radiating particles to synchrotron - emitting electrons and the magnetic field are typically poorly constrained , which leads to large uncertainties in conversions between radio emission and mechanical power for individual sources .",
    "an issue that often complicates the study of bcgs ( and indeed all galaxies ) using radio observations is that the observed emission can be separated significantly in both time and space from the event that created it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of spectral ageing ) .",
    "single - band , often low spatial resolution observations are frequently the only radio information available for a bcg .",
    "while these galaxies are then known to be radio loud , there is large uncertainty both in the physical scale and age of this emission , making multi - wavelength comparisons difficult .",
    "observations at a range of spectral frequencies and spatial resolutions are required to overcome this issue . in this paper",
    "we use a wide range of data to decompose the radio emission of nearly 300 bcgs into an active component - attributable to current accretion , and an inactive component - attributable to historical accretion .",
    "we use these decompositions to link the central agn activity to the larger cluster environment .",
    "galaxy clusters can be broadly split into two types .",
    "the first , known as ` cool cores ' ( ccs ) , have short central cooling times ( t@xmath8 ) and strongly peaked x - ray profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second type are more dynamically disturbed , exhibit flatter x - ray profiles and are commonly known as ` non - cool cores ' ( nccs ) .",
    "directly measuring t@xmath8 , or equivalently entropy , of a cluster is observationally difficult and strongly affected by resolution effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of line - emitting ( predominantly h@xmath0+[nii ] ) filamentary nebulae around bcgs is known to be strongly indicative of the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "such lines indicate the presence of multi - phase gas , and are almost always present only when the central entropy drops below 30  kev  cm@xmath1 , equivalent to a t@xmath8 @xmath105x@xmath11yr @xcite .",
    "these filamentary structures are photoionised by neither the agn itself nor star formation .",
    "instead they appear to be photoionised by either cosmic rays or hot x - ray plasma penetrating cold gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively it has been suggested that they may be excited by the reconnection of magnetic field lines trailing in the wakes of rising cavities @xcite .",
    "the presence of these lines can therefore be used as a proxy , with line - emitting ( le ) clusters corresponding to strongly cooling cores and non - line emitters ( nles ) to either weak- or non - cooling core clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "overall , this paper looks at the general radio properties of the bcg population as a whole .",
    "it uses a large data volume to decompose the radio emission and better understand the radio - loudness of bcgs in relation to the wider environment .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the sample .",
    "section 3 presents the observations and data .",
    "we discuss the radio - sed decomposition in section 4 .",
    "section 5 considers the monochromatic ( l - band , @xmath71.4  ghz ) radio properties of the sample .",
    "section 6 considers decomposed radio properties .",
    "sections 7 and 8 contain the discussion and conclusions respectively .",
    "comments on individual source decompositions can be found in appendix a. data products for data presented for the first time in the current paper are tabulated beyond this and are available in the online version . unless otherwise stated , we refer to a bcg by use of its host cluster name .",
    "we have used a standard @xmath12cdm cosmology with the following cosmological parameters unless otherwise stated : @xmath13 = 0.3 , @xmath14 = 0.7 , @xmath15 = 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "our parent sample is drawn from three rosat x - ray selected cluster catalogues - the bcs @xcite , ebcs @xcite and reflex @xcite samples , which contain 206 , 107 and 447 clusters respectively . since publication some catalogue entries have been re - classified , and there are also a small number of cross - catalogue duplicates . we therefore remove a minority of sources , leaving us with a sample of 199 , 104 and 417 sources in the bcs , ebcs and refflex samples respectively .",
    "our total x - ray selected parent sample therefore consists of 720 clusters .",
    "the bcg for each of these clusters has been optically identified and observed spectrally ( @xcite , edge _ et al . _ _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "the sample was split into those which exhibit optical emission lines ( line - emitters , hereforth les ) and those which do not ( non line - emitters , hereforth nles ) ( see also table [ ebcsreflexbreakdown ] ) . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the presence of these lines is strongly indicative of the cluster containing a strong cool - core .",
    "it must be noted that their absence is not sufficient to rule out the presence of a weaker cooling core ( 5x@xmath11yr @xmath10 t@xmath8 @xmath10 t@xmath16 ) but does point towards these clusters being less dynamically settled .",
    "an additional point to bear in mind is that not all clusters contain a single top - ranked bcg , and may instead have two or more similarly sized top - ranked galaxies . in our main sample ( see section [ ms_sample ] , roughly 5% of our clusters are identified as having multiple bcgs ( see appendices ) .",
    "this is less than the equivalent @xmath715% of the sample of 215 clusters in @xcite that are claimed to have multiple bcgs .",
    "we could therefore be missing a co - dominant galaxy in some cases , though we note that all clusters were visually inspected in both optical and radio maps and no instances were found of clear unattributeds bcgs . quantifying the effect of unidentified secondary bcgs",
    "is difficult . of the 5% of our sample with multiple bcgs ,",
    "only one double - bcg system is hosted by a cc - cluster ( a2627 ) - both bcgs in this cluster are found to be radio - loud . only around 30% of the multiple - bcgs in ncc clusters host radio - loud agn , which is less than the approximately 50% of all ncc clusters in our sample that host radio - loud bcgs ( see section [ le_nle_match_rates ] ) . whilst clearly circumstantial , and affected by small number statistics , this actually points towards the differences in the radio - loud fraction between ccs and nccs being higher in systems with multiple bcgs , which would strengthen the results within this paper .",
    "the fraction of clusters with multiple bcgs is expected to increase with redshift ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so should be less of an effect for our sample , which is at low redshift .",
    "overall , we do not believe we are overlty affected by any potential small fraction of unidentified co - dominant bcgs , although we do caution that this caveat should be considered when interpreting the results .",
    "the bcs / ebcs sky coverage overlaps fully the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) radio survey @xcite ( dec @xmath17 -40@xmath18 , complete to @xmath72.5 mjy at 1.4  ghz ) .",

    "these sub - samples are hereon referred to as the reflex - nvss and reflex - sumss samples .",
    "thirty - six reflex sources fall in the overlap between sumss and nvss .",
    "these sources are left in both the reflex - nvss and reflex - sumss samples when these samples are treated independently . combining the bcs and ebcs catalogues",
    "provides a 303 source subsample that we henceforth refer to as the ( e)bcs .",
    "the comparable number of clusters in ( e)bcs and reflex - nvss allows for self - consistency checks of any found results since the samples were independently compiled .",
    ".bcgs within the ( e)bcs and reflex galaxy cluster samples ( after removal of ` contaminant sources ' ) .",
    "the samples are broken down both by radio detection in nvss and/or sumss and also the presence of extended optical emission lines around the , which are indicative of the presence of a strong cool core . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ obs_table ]    literature searches were performed , and seds populated , for all sources in the main sample and its extension .",
    "data were taken from the major radio catalogues ( e.g. australia telescope 20  ghz survey ( at20 g ) , @xcite ; nvss and faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ) at 1.4  ghz , @xcite ; sumss at 843  mhz , @xcite ; molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ) at 408  mhz , @xcite ; texas survey of radio sources ( texas ) at 365  mhz , @xcite ; westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) and westerbork in the southern hemisphere ( wish ) at 325  mhz , @xcite ; tifr gmrt sky survey ( tgss ) at 150  mhz ; vla low - frequency sky survey ( vlss ) at 74  mhz , @xcite ) .",
    "additional fluxes found by searches around the radio - peak coordinates in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) database and/or the national radio astronomy archive ( nrao ) were individually scrutinised to ensure matches .",
    "our atca data were calibrated to the @xcite flux scale for the standard flux calibrator 1934 - 638 , as calculated in the miriad version 20110127 task ` mfboot ' .",
    "vla data were scaled to the standard aips version 31dec11 perley - butler scale using the task ` setjy ' ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "both of these scales are very similar to , but have small improvements over the older baars scale @xcite .",
    "the wide range of literature values use a range of similar flux standards .",
    "this represents an added uncertainty to our seds . for data pre - dating the baars scale ( very small number of instances ) , we have used later determinations re - scaled to the baars scale .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by this range of flux scales should be considered , however they are much less than those associated with intrinsic source variability and the absolute flux uncertainties , hence should be negligible .",
    "the total radio sed of each bcg can be decomposed into two major components - an active , typically flat - spectrum ( spectral index @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath0@xmath100.5 ) component attributed to current activity within the agn and a typically steeper spectrum component ( @xmath0@xmath170.5 ) that comprises all other emission .",
    "the steeper component is most likely to be due to lobe emission and so traces past activity of the central engine .",
    "alternatively it could be due to other acceleration processes towards the centre of the galaxy cluster in which the bcg resides , such as sloshing giving rise to a mini - halo or phoenix relics ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the specific morphological and energetic nature of this component is often difficult to determine and a large variety of nomenclature for the various source - types has arisen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .",
    "the steep spectrum means that this component becomes less prominent towards higher frequencies and is often faint at l - band ( @xmath71.4  ghz ) and above , rendering it difficult to detect if an active core component is present .",
    "conversely , current agn activity manifesting itself as a flat - spectrum core component can be swamped at lower frequencies .",
    "high resolution observations are required at low frequency to properly characterise these components . however , in this work we wish to address the difference in radio emission between ongoing core activity and older , steep - spectrum emission .",
    "we use ` non - core ' as an umbrella term to refer to the steeper spectrum component not associated with ongoing core activity , regardless of physical origin and spatial resolution .    the core component may show a synchrotron self - absorption turnover at @xmath7few ghz but tends to remain flat ( or , less commonly , rising ) out to several tens of ghz .",
    "similarly the ` non - core ' component may show a turnover , albeit at much lower ( @xmath21 a few hundred mhz ) frequencies .",
    "this is more likely to be attributable to free - free absorption .",
    "additionally , this component may exhibit a steepening index at higher frequencies due to synchrotron ageing of the underlying electron population .",
    "when present , both cluster scale radio halos and peripheral relics ( a.k.a .",
    " radio gischt  ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are excluded from our non - core component , as these are both unrelated to the current agn activity of the bcg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there are however a number of other radio structures seen in cluster cores such as mini - haloes and phoenix relics whose relationship to the bcg and the cooling core is more uncertain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is debate in the literature as to the true nature of so - called ` mini - halos ' and these present a somewhat contentious middle - ground between cluster related and agn - related radio - emission .",
    "true mini - halos tend to be reasonably spherically symmetric , steep spectrum , low surface brightness sources that are a few 100  kpcs in diameter and centred on the bcg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the electron diffusion lifetime is so long as to exclude acceleration by the central agn .",
    "the emitting particles must therefore be accelerated in - situ and appear to be related to the cooling flow .",
    "it is however possible ( and indeed likely ) that the seed population originates in the agn .",
    "confusingly , it appears that bcgs often contain a smaller ( @xmath10 few 10s kpc ) , amorphous halo or _ ` confined cluster core ' _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that appears to be related directly to confined , ageing agn ejecta .",
    "this is also occasionally referred to as a mini - halo .",
    "as the exact nature of the non - core emission is not paramount for our purposes , we may include in our non - core measures emission that could reasonably be called ` mini - halo ' in the literature , if it contributes a portion of the flux in low - resolution observations that provide such a measurement as the ` bcg flux ' .",
    "the majority of sources were unresolved at the resolution limit of our observations ( typically around 4  at c - band , equivalent to @xmath78  kpc at our median redshift ) .",
    "where core and non - core components were morphologically distinct , individual seds were produced and fitted directly for each component .",
    "sources that remain unresolved on few arcsecond scales could consist of an active core only or small scale yet ageing non - core emission .",
    "when very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations were available , the ratio of milli - arcsecond to arcsecond scale flux could be used to determine if any flux was resolved out on intermediate scales , and what fraction of the flux was truly associated with the core . for sources that are unresolved on few - arcsecond scales but for which vlbi observations are not available",
    ", variability and spectral shape were used to perform a breakdown of the seds on a case - by - case basis ( see below ) . where a strong case could not be made for unresolved sources being either core or non - core dominated , conservative assumptions were employed .",
    "four simple models were considered for each source sed - a single power law of the form : @xmath22 a split power law of the form : @xmath23 a ` dropline ' model , which allows for a high frequency rollover to simulate synchrotron ageing : @xmath24 or a gigahertz peaked source ( gps)-like model that allows for a spectral peak to simulate self - absorption @xcite @xmath25 where s denotes measured flux and  a s are constants to be determined .",
    "these fits are not intended as physical models .",
    "indeed it is clear that for the dropline model , extrapolation outside of the region being considered would lead to negative predicted flux . instead they are merely phenomenological fits to the known data that provide a decomposition of the two radio components - core and non - core .",
    "the single power law provides the simplest possible fit , and often had to be employed for poorly sampled seds .",
    "the index of this power law was considered , with a flat or inverted slope leading to the detection being attributed to a core component , or a steep slope meaning the detection was classed as a non - core . the nominal cut - off between these distinctions",
    "was taken as @xmath0 = 0.5 .",
    "however , anything flatter than @xmath0 = 0.8 or steeper than @xmath0 = 0.2 was further scrutinised .",
    "maps were visually searched for physical extension at each observed frequency .",
    "variability was considered to indicate the presence of a powerful core , with the proviso that this component is more likely to vary on shorter timescales . in situations where there was strong evidence for one component dominating the observed flux and hence spectral shape ,",
    "then the value of this component was taken as a measurement of that component .",
    "a limit was placed on the other component by extrapolating with a representative steep ( @xmath0@xmath26 = 1.0 , see section [ index_section ] ) index from the lowest observed frequency or with representative flat ( @xmath0@xmath27 = 0.2 , see section [ index_section ] ) index from the highest observed frequency for non - core and core limits respectively .    where a clear spectral break could be seen ( e.g. see panel b , figure [ exampleseds ] ) , a split power law was employed to fit the two components .",
    "highly variable sources could display an apparently split spectrum if observations taken at different frequencies were substantially separated in time .",
    "timescales and any variations between observations at different frequencies were used to help distinguish between consistent and apparent spectral breaks .",
    "seds that exhibited the high frequency rollover typical of an ageing electron population were fit with a dropline model .",
    "when only this component was apparent in an sed , the value derived was attributed to the non - core component and a limit placed on the core ( e.g. panel c , figure [ exampleseds ] ) .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , a minority of sources exhibited a strongly inverted , peaked spectrum .",
    "these spectral components were fitted using the gps - like model .",
    "this spectral shape is typical of a gps source , commonly interpreted to be either a young or recently re - triggered agn and as such is indicative of a strong , active core @xcite .",
    "however in a couple of cases a steep - spectrum , low frequency ` tail ' of emission can also be seen in the sed , allowing the non - core component to also be measured ( e.g. panel a , figure [ exampleseds ] ) . where only a gps - like component was apparent in an sed",
    ", a value was taken for the core and a limit derived for the non - core component ( e.g. panel d , figure [ exampleseds ] ) .    during the fitting ,",
    "consideration was also given to the possibility of flux on spatial frequencies not sampled by observations and hence effectively ` resolved out ' .",
    "we checked the ratio of peak flux to flux extracted using a single gaussian fit ( aips task jmfit ) for sources that appeared unresolved .",
    "furthermore , where possible the flux ratio between two unresolved observations of a source at the same frequency but different spatial sampling was taken ( e.g. first / nvss at 1.4  ghz ) . in truly unresolved sources , both of these ratios should give unity .",
    "of course it should be noted that variability could also affect these ratios .",
    "again , caution was employed to ensure that such effects did not overly bias our breakdowns .",
    "full details of the breakdowns for each source in the main sample can be found in appendices [ appendix_notes ] - [ appendix_decompositions ] .",
    "all seds are available online @xcite .      for some brighter members of the ms+ extension (",
    "e.g. hydra - a and hercules - a ) clear morphological decompositions were possible .",
    "where this was not the case , spectral breakdowns were performed using the same criteria as for the main sample with the exception that , due to the typically much lower spectral coverage and less available data , gps - like and dropline models were not used as they were poorly constrained .",

    "* ) and at20 g were considered to determine whether the source has a flatter spectrum component to high frequencies or whether the l - band flux is attributable to a dominant non - core . where a limit on a higher frequency flux determined that the l - band detection must be due to a source with spectral index @xmath0@xmath170.8 then it was attributed to dominant non - core emission and an estimate of this made using a short extrapolation with @xmath0@xmath28=1.0 .",

    "we therefore choose @xmath0@xmath26=1.0 as our representative index . for cases where an extrapolation of a given component is required",
    "we employ uncertainties of @xmath31@xmath32=@xmath330.2 .",
    "the presence of a significant tail of ultra - steep non - cores suggests that such emission may be fairly common around bcgs .",
    "amorphous and mini - halo emission is often found to be very steep ( @xmath0@xmath171.5 ) , suggesting there may be a link between these structures and emission from a persistent agn .    for sources not detected in our pointed observations ,",

    "initially we consider the flux limited monochromatic radio properties of our parent sample around 1.4  ghz , to gain an overview of the general radio properties .      the optical bcg positions of the entire parent sample were cross - referenced with the nvss and sumss radio catalogues , initially searching within their respective positional uncertainties ( 1 - 7  for nvss , 1 - 10  for sumss ) .",
    "additional uncertainty for the radio source position arises due to the relatively large beam sizes ( @xmath7 45  ) . where a radio source was matched to within one beam size but greater than 2  from the optical position , the sources were inspected visually to ascertain whether the match was robust .",
    "additionally , where multiple matches fell within the beam size they were visually inspected to ensure multiple components of individual sources were appropriately included .",
    "a sizeable proportion of the ( e)bcs clusters ( @xmath773% ) fall within the first @xcite survey region ( matched to sdss , dec limit @xmath17 -10 ) , which has a higher resolution ( @xmath7 5  ) and lower flux limit ( @xmath7 2 mjy ) than nvss .",
    "a much smaller portion ( @xmath726% ) of sources within the reflex - nvss sample also fell within the first region .",
    "sources within this overlap region were additionally cross - matched with the first survey and radio - optical overlays were inspected . with the higher resolution data of first",
    ", we find that @xmath715% of sources tagged as matches in nvss were likely not associated with the bcg .",
    "it should therefore be noted that the absence of a similarly high resolution southern survey is likely to introduce a bias in that mis - attributions of a radio - source to the bcg are less likely to be noticed in the southern hemisphere .",
    "however , we also find that @xmath710% of sources in the first footprint that were not detected by nvss were either detected with the fainter threshold of first or shown to be radio - loud independently of another nearby source and hence this bias is likely to be tempered by the lower detection threshold and higher resolution of the first survey .",
    "the number of bcgs matched to radio - sources can be seen in table [ ebcsreflexbreakdown ] , along with a breakdown of whether these bcgs are optically line - emitting or not ( le or nle ) .",
    "we find detection percentages of 61.1@xmath335.5% , 62.6@xmath335.5% and 60.3@xmath337.7% for ( e)bcs , reflex - nvss and reflex - sumss respectively , assuming simple binomial errors with a 95% confidence level .",
    "these bcg radio - detection rates are slightly elevated compared to other x - ray selected samples .",
    "for example , @xcite found a 50.3% detection rate for a luminosity cut of l@xmath34 @xmath17 10@xmath35whz@xmath4 for their sample of 43 nearby galaxy groups with chandra archival data .",
    "a @xmath750% detection rate was found for both the brightest 55 ( b55 , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite studied a combined sample of 685 x - ray selected galaxy clusters . matching to the nvss",
    ", they found a matched detection rate between the cluster coordinates and radio - sources @xmath173 mjy of @xmath752.1% ( or @xmath748.5% accounting for expected background contamination ) .",
    "where possible we have used the lower flux detection threshold of the first survey and also matched the optical bcg positions rather than cluster x - ray positions . considering these factors , we have reasonable agreement with previous radio - bcg detection rates in x - ray selected clusters .",
    "our detection rate is significantly higher than for otherwise derived samples ( e.g. @xmath730% for optical selection , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* with bcg mass - dependency ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that x - ray selected samples are biased towards selecting the most massive , settled clusters which are more likely to host a radio - loud bcg @xcite .",
    "however , a fraction of our non - detections are likely to be radio - loud but below our detection threshold and so our detection rate can only provide a lower limit on the overall duty cycle of radio - loudness of bcgs .",
    "the mis - identification of some clusters that contain central radio sources , due to x - ray emission being incorrectly attributed to the agn rather than the icm , may also contribute .",
    "we discuss possible cluster survey mis - identifications in section [ surveysection ] .",

    "we detect 84.1@xmath337.6% , 87.0@xmath337.5% and 83.7@xmath3311.0% of the les and 51.6@xmath336.7% , 54.7@xmath336.6% and 51.3@xmath339.2% of the nles in ( e)bcs , reflex - nvss and reflex - sumss respectively , again assuming a simple binomial errors with a 95% confidence level .",
    "note that these detection fractions are affected by inconsistent flux limits and that if we instead consider only our c - band pointed observations of the main sample bcgs then we recover detection fractions of 90.8@xmath335.1@xmath36 for les and 48.9@xmath338.8@xmath36 for nles down to our typical detection limit of @xmath70.3 mjy .",
    "these detection fractions compare favourably with those of @xcite , who report detection fractions of 45@xmath36 , 67@xmath36 and 100@xmath36 for non - cool cores , weak cool cores ( 1gyr @xmath10 t@xmath8 @xmath10 7gyr ) and strong cool cores ( t@xmath8 @xmath10 1gyr ) respectively , for the hiflugcs sample of the 64 x - ray brightest galaxy clusters .",
    "if the simplest case is taken whereby the detection rate is taken as a proxy for the duty cycle of agn activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then this provides clear evidence that the duty cycle of bcgs in strong cooling flow environments is higher than for bcgs in less extreme cluster centres .",
    "a further clear distinction in the radio properties between les and nles becomes apparent by considering their luminosity distributions ( see figure [ fig : l_lfs ] ) .",

    "differences in the redshift distributions of clusters in the two samples may account for some of this scatter .",
    "malmquist bias would give preference for detecting higher luminosity sources in a sample with a higher redshift distribution .",
    "the redshift distributions of the clusters with radio - loud bcgs for the three sub - samples are shown in figure [ fig : redshiftdistributions ] , with 1@xmath38 uncertainties assuming poissonian errors .",
    "there is no significant difference in the redshift distribution of our line emitting and non - line emitting bcgs . for the reflex sample , to low significance there are proportionally more le bcgs in the lowest redshift bin ( z@xmath100.1 ) .",
    "however , this would suggest a higher redshift distribution for our nles than les and should therefore be expected to bias our nle sample to be more luminous than les . hence such a bias , if present , actually serves to strengthen our result .    to minimise any redshift related uncertainty , the distributions were replotted for only those clusters at z @xmath10 0.1",

    "this relatively small sample was found to have a reasonably uniform range of @xmath39 - @xmath40 indices of @xmath0 = -0.27 - 2.12 .",
    "this range of indices highlights the wide diversity of radio activity found within the bcg population .",
    "it also highlights the large uncertainties that are invoked by assuming a single spectral index for a population of sources when extrapolating too far from a single frequency observation .",
    "as such we do not extrapolate the reflex - sumss sample to 1.4  ghz for direct comparison ( figures [ fig : l_lfs ] and [ fig : lowz_l_lfs ] ) and instead note only that the luminosity distinction between les and nles remains .      to further investigate how the radio - behaviour of the bcg connects with the global properties of the host cluster we retrieve the integrated cluster x - ray emissions from the bcs , ebcs and reflex catalogues .",
    "table 6a of the reflex catalogue contains the x - ray luminosities calculated using our cosmology .",
    "however , the bcs and its extension both give x - ray luminosities for an einstein - de - sitter universe with h@xmath41=50 .",
    "we correct this to our cosmology , with typical conversion factors of 0.5 - 0.7 for our redshift range .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : l_band_xray ] the monochromatic l - band radio powers for all sources in our parent sample as a function of the x - ray luminosity of their host clusters .",
    "a general trend for the highest radio luminosity sources to inhabit the most x - ray luminous clusters is seen , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "the extended nature of clusters means that the catalogue observations sample regions of much greater physical extent than just the cluster core . the integrated x - ray luminosity is therefore driven predominantly by the cluster mass , with more massive clusters corresponding to more x - ray luminous systems . the correlation observed in figure [ fig : l_band_xray ] is therefore indicative of the most massive clusters tending to host the most powerful radio - agn , which may itself be due to more massive clusters hosting more massive bcgs and in turn more massive central black holes . a secondary effect , for cool - core clusters to have elevated x - ray luminosities due to the higher core densities could also be contributing .",
    "however this is likely to be a much more subtle effect than the mass dependency and is not the dominant driver of the correlation .     for why this extrapolation is uncertain .",

    "the dashed lines are illustrative only and represent one - to - one normalisation with a two order - of - magnitude separation.,width=340 ]",
    "as stated in the introduction , the true nature of any observed radio activity is difficult to understand when observing a sample at only one frequency .",
    "we now consider the properties of the decomposed core and non - core radio components , their relationship to each other and their separate and linked relationships to other cluster and agn properties .      for each of the sources within the main sample , we take monochromatic proxy measures of the core and non - core components at 10 and 1  ghz respectively .",
    "ideally , the cores would be normalised at a higher frequency and non - cores at a lower frequency . however , often our radio seds are more sparsely sampled far away from the traditional cm - range wavelengths .",
    "hence , our choice of 10  ghz and 1  ghz for the normalisations are a compromise between ensuring the relevant components can be separated whilst still being within the best - sampled section of the radio waveband .",
    "we plot a radio ` colour - colour diagram ' of the 10  ghz core normalisation against the 1  ghz non - core normalisation in figure [ the_diagram ] .",
    "both cluster types can host powerful radio sources , yet bcgs in strongly cooling clusters are much more likely to be core dominated . to further elucidate this difference in distribution , in figure [ ms_histogram ] we plot a histogram of the ratio of the 10  ghz core measure to the 1  ghz non - core measure for the sources in the main sample that have well determined values for _ both _ components .",
    "as in figure [ the_diagram ] , we see a tendency for les to host much more core dominated radio - sources .",
    "strong core components only appear to be found in les .",
    "the presence of very powerful non - cores in nles , normally associated with classical fanaroff - riley type i ( fr - i ) and type ii ( fr - ii ) sources , belies that there must at some times be powerful core activity in these objects .",
    "it stands to reason that in a much larger sample we would find such events .",
    "however , that they are not present in the current sample suggests that such core outbursts must be short - lived . indeed we find that for the 48.8% of sources that are identified as les in our main sample , 60.2% have a determinable core component of which 83.1% are more powerful than 10@xmath35whz@xmath4 at 10  ghz ( see also section [ letonle_differences ] ) .",
    "however , of the remaining 51.2% of sources tagged as nles only 11.6% have an identifiable core component .",
    "only 5% of these nle core components are more powerful than 10@xmath35w  hz@xmath4 at 10  ghz and none has a core power above 5@xmath4210@xmath35whz@xmath4 ( see also section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "this suggests an upper limit to the _ core _ duty cycles of nles of @xmath101% with core powers greater than 5@xmath4210@xmath35whz@xmath4 whereas the prevalence of powerful core activity is much higher and more persistent , in les .",
    "it is the presence ( or lack ) of an active _ core _ component that appears to be the most important distinction between the radio properties of le and nle bcgs , even more so than their overall incidence of radio loudness ( see section [ le_nle_match_rates ] ) .",
    "the wide range of ratios of these two components has important implications for the variety of sources that will be contained within any flux selected radio sample , with samples selected at different frequencies containing vastly different source types .",
    "this is discussed in section [ surveysection ]      to ascertain whether our main sample is representative of the full parent sample , in figure [ the_diagram ] we also show ( in light grey ) the decompositions for all sources in the main sample+ that do not fall within the main sample .    considering the top panel of figure [ the_diagram ]",

    "this is therefore indicative of steady agn fuelling in bcgs over bubble - rise timescales .",
    "regression fits to the data are performed using the iraf _ buckleyjames _ algorithm . as in section [ oiii_section ] neither of our variables is truly independent .",
    "we assign the cavity power as the independent variable for fitting purposes since this sub - sample was selected on the basis of having observed cavities .",

    "in their recent review @xcite argue that a plausible explanation for these disparate results may be that bondi accreting gas goes through an intermediate stage where it cools prior to finally being accreted onto the black hole .",
    "alternatively , the agn may be fuelled by cold phase accretion whereby blobs of cold gas condense non - linearly at scales @xmath75 - 30kpc from the black hole and infall on less than the cooling timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a recent paper considering the origin of multi - phase gas in cool - cores , @xcite find that thermal conduction and cold - mode accretion are complementary processes in regulating cluster cores . at higher core entropies conduction",

    "the resultant cold clouds could then power the sporadic periods of high activity whilst the agn activity could still relate to the wider bondi rate _ on average_.    such a scenario appears likely within cluster cores , where the cooling flow deposits large amounts of molecular gas within the bcg .",
    "the steady build - up of such cold clouds ensures that the replenishment time is low and hence naturally explains the high duty cycle of radio loudness in both nles and les .",
    "the high _ inner duty cycle _ of _ active _ core components in les is slightly trickier to comprehend purely by sporadic processes .",
    "we postulate that within the le clusters both ready cooled material and direct hot phase gas fuel the agn .",
    "the clumpy cold clouds would be responsible for the brighter periods of activity @xcite . in between these periods",
    ", a steady trickle of hot gas would still be able to reach the nucleus ensuring the persistency of core emission .    a similar picture to this",
    "is found in the simulations of @xcite who find that under idealised conditions , cool clumps condense from the icm due partly to the actions of jetted outflows .",
    "it could be that the presence of a weak bondi - powered jet catalyses the formation of cold clouds that can then fuel more powerful activity",
    ". such a process may be partly responsible for the so called ` molecular fountains ' seen in some bcgs ( e.g. a1835 , * ? ? ? * ) where cool material appears to condense behind rising cavities before falling back towards the central engine .",
    "we have not in this paper explicitly classified our bcgs as low - excitation or high - excitation radio galaxies ( lergs or hergs respectively ) , a distinction that appears strongly related to the accretion state ( inefficient / efficient respectively for lergs / hergs : * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the vast majority of bcgs are lergs , typified by accretion efficiences l@xmath100.01l@xmath64 ( where l@xmath64 is the eddington luminosity ) . at these low rates ,",
    "accretion is believed to be via an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) . whatever the coupling efficiency of the mechanical energy output by a bcg , this is not likely to substantially change over the range of luminosities we see in our sample as they always remain in the lerg , adaf - stage .",
    "changes in radio luminosity are therefore most likely to correspond to changes in mechanical feedback power ( as corroborated by figure [ cavity_correlations ] ) , rather than large changes in the accretion structure such as the collapse of an adaf into a classical shakura - sunyaev thin - disk ( e.g. see review of accretion structures by * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , in analogy with the scenario seen in black hole binaries , the transition from an adaf to a thin - disk accretion mode may be expected to coincide with a switch from magnetically arrested to magneto - rotationally supported accretion and hence the launching of a short - term ballistic jet @xcite .",
    "such an event would cause the collapse of the large scale - height magnetic fields present in the inner accretion zone that are required for the launching of a typical , steady jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the apparently highly persistent activity we infer from our sample would oppose such a magnetic restructuring , certainly for our les . that the periods of higher activity correspond to a difference in accretion structure ( namely , a transition to a thin disk )",
    "is therefore considered highly unlikely and instead more likely correspond to something more akin to a greatly scaled - up analogue of the flaring seen in sgr a*.    fusion timeframes can be constructed to test the outline feasibility of the above scenario .",
    "if we take the alfvn speed of electrons in a typical cluster to be @xmath7100kms@xmath4 @xcite then this translates to a dispersal velocity of roughly 0.1 kpc myr@xmath4 . for a typical electron emitting lifetime of 100myr",
    "then a structure @xmath710kpc can be expected from simple diffusion alone .",
    "if we consider that even in strongly confused cluster cores , the jets will provide some bulk transport away from the central black hole then it is clear that amorphous haloes are fully consistent with this toy model , assuming the dispersion is reasonably homogenous .      for the size of our parent sample ,",
    "geometry causes us to expect @xmath720 sources to be aligned within @xmath75@xmath18 of the line - of - sight .",
    "such a population may present itself as a population of flat spectrum , apparently powerful cores but would have their intrinsic core powers overestimated by potentially large factors .",
    "however , note that we purposefully removed bllac objects from our parent sample so as not to be overtly affected by a handful of strongly beamed sources .",
    "there is also no logical reason why le - bcgs would more commonly have aligned cores than nles .",
    "relativistic beaming of the inner - jet in an existing radio source could account for some seemingly strong , flat spectrum components of otherwise steep spectrum sources if the jet - axis has precessed into favourable alignment .",
    "our sample does include a couple of sources that have previously been considered to be mildly beamed .",
    "for example , the bcg of a2055 appears to be a head - tail source on few - arcsecond scales , but the bright core may be beamed @xcite . similarly , a2627(a ) only appears to have marginally resolved jet structure on arcsecond scales but its agn is x - ray dominated , hence the flux may be boosted by the presence of a beamed bllac - like nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , for this to account for all our split spectrum sources would require a very high precession speed in a significant number of sources . additionally , the long timescales between some of the archival data we use in compiling our seds shows that the flat and gps - like behaviour is persistent over more than decade timescales .",
    "this is therefore unlikely to be purely the result of beaming , which would give significant , short - term variation .",
    "furthermore , vlba imaging of the central regions shows symmetrical two - sided structures on few parsec scales in many of our active bcgs hence showing that the source is not favourably aligned for strong beaming .",
    "this vlba data will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "overall , we concede that some blurring of results due to relativistic effects are essentially unavoidable for any large sample of radio - agn , however due to the arguments stated here we do not believe beaming to overtly affect our results .",
    "the presence of two very different radio components in the seds of bcgs , means that the source population sampled in a flux - limited radio survey of agn is highly dependent upon the observed frequency ; unlike the case for a population of single spectral index sources .",
    "higher frequency samples ( roughly comparable to a horizontal split on figure [ the_diagram ] ) will contain a higher proportion of core - dominated systems whereas low frequency selected samples ( more equivalent to a vertical split on figure [ the_diagram ] : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will favour those dominated by steeper spectrum emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "whilst it is already well established that high frequency surveys will preferentially detect young sources , for bcgs the effect is slightly more subtle in that high frequency samples will preferentially detect those sources with the highest _ inner duty cycle _ of core activity ( i.e. bcgs that are more persistent ) .    as the youngest and most recent agn activity will peak spectrally at higher frequencies ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , samples taken at frequencies below the characteristic turnover will preferentially detect older outbursts .",
    "samples at progressively higher frequencies will therefore contain a greater proportion of younger sources .",
    "conversely , for a single observing frequency , matching samples at increasing redshift will show the same effect such that the population of radio sources to higher redshift , particularly for redshifts greater than 2 ( where a restframe @xmath715  ghz characteristic gps peak would be redshifted below 5  ghz ) , will appear younger and more active - effectively mimicking evolution in the source population .",
    "much increased spectral coverage is required before improvements to the radio k - correction above a simple power - law extrapolation will be confirmed possible / necessary or not .",
    "however , the effect should be considered when studying the redshift evolution of the radio population .",
    "the powerful core components in le - bcgs , especially in instances where these cause spectral peaks to higher radio frequencies , may be an important contaminant in sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) cluster surveys .",
    "the ramifications of these strong core components are explored in a sister paper , hogan _ et al . _ 2015b ( submitted ) .",
    "we have studied the radio properties in bcgs drawn from a large sample of x - ray selected galaxy clusters .",
    "the sample is split by the presence of optical emission lines ( h@xmath0+[nii ] ) , using the proxy that when these lines are present the cluster most likely corresponds to being a strong cool core and when absent the dynamical state of the cluster is markedly less relaxed .",
    "we present and collate a large radio data volume for this sample and consider the overall radio properties of the sample as a function of environment .",
    "furthermore , we decompose the bcg radio emission into two components - a core , attributable to ongoing injection agn activity and a non - core comprising everything else .",
    "we then consider these components in order to better understand the activity .",
    "chiefly we find that :    * the duty cycle of radio - loudness is significantly higher for bcgs in strong cool - core clusters ( @xmath1785% ) than for those in non strong cool - core clusters ( @xmath1752.5% ) . *",
