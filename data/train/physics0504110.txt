    "the year 2005 has been deemed the `` world year of physics '' in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of einstein s `` annus mirabilis . '' as a result , numerous discussions of einstein s achievements will ensue throughout the year .",
    "there will , no doubt , be numerous presentations of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics in newsprint , books , and on television .",
    "it is the responsibility of physicists to educate the lay - public about these ideas and their importance to society .",
    "however , it behooves the physics community to insure that such presentations are free of inaccuracies and hyperbole .",
    "action must be taken when broad , inaccurate assertions are put forth ( such as stating everything is random in quantum mechanics , or that einstein did not believe in quantum mechanics@xcite ) .",
    "there is one concept that has been ingrained into the collective mindset of not only lay - people but also many working physicists .",
    "this is the notion of relativistic mass ; a moving object s mass increases with velocity with respect to an observer considered to be at rest , @xmath0    the decision whether or not to introduce relativistic mass in pedagogical expositions is still not universally agreed upon .",
    "the debate on the usage of this concept has been going on since the early days of relativity . on both sides of the issue",
    "there have been advocates insisting their view is the correct one .",
    "some have relied on historical precedent as a rationale for its inclusion .",

    "the need for continued discussion stems from recent work attempting to legitimize the concept as a basis for special relativity , and also the continual flood of books utilizing the concept geared for the general public .",
    "most of the previous arguments debating the use of relativistic mass have oversimplified the difference in viewpoints in question ; it is not merely a matter of taste whether to employ the concept or not .",
    "thus , the first task at hand is to define the opposing viewpoints .",
    "non - relativistic mass view , geometric formulation ( g ) : : :    central to the geometric formulation ( g ) is that the isotropy of space    and uniformity of space and time , along with the notion of    causuality@xcite@xcite@xcite , is sufficient to lead to a    four - dimensional spacetime endowed with a lorentzian signature metric .",
    "the principle of relativity yields a consistent kinematics    incorporating the effects of time dilation , length contraction ,    addition of velocities , etc .",
    "the lorentz transformation is seen as a    direct consequence of the hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the extension to    dynamics is immediate by postulating the primitive concepts of mass    and momentum . in order to have a lorentz covariant 4-momentum",
    ", the    mass is found to be a lorentz invariant .",
    "the validity of this approach    will be assumed in what follows .",
    "relativistic mass ( rm ) : : :    here we define the concept of relativistic mass ( rm ) as the relation    ( [ rm ] ) .",
    "this is a dynamical concept without specification to    kinematics .",
    "exactly how rm is invoked in relation to kinematics will    be explored below , as this is the purpose of this paper .    in regards to the antiquated concepts of longitudinal and transverse mass",
    ", they shall not be considered here . c. adler@xcite demonstrated how these must be accepted if one is to propose an inertial relativistic mass .      in most introductory treatments of special relativity",
    "the exact nature of how rm is arrived at is varied and often vague . thus , the task at hand is to explore how this concept is to be incorporated within the theoretical structure of special relativity .",
    "there are two possibilities ,    1 .",
    "rm supplants the geometric formulation as a primitive concept , 2 .",
    "rm is introduced in conjunction with the geometric formulation .",
    "however one may feel about the validity of either possibility , both are taken seriously in different works and thus it is important to examine each closely .",
    "we begin with the foremost reason that rm is introduced in works directed at the general public ; to explain why no material object can travel at or beyond the speed of light ( this concept will be denoted as noc ) .",
    "given that g implies time dilation , which yields noc , the question arises as to exactly how rm is invoked to give noc .",
    "there are two possibilities : either rm itself is the causation of noc ( 1 . above ) , or rm is considered in conjunction with the proper kinematics to yield noc ( 2 . above ) . if neither position can be made tenable all that is left is a heuristic device .",
    "those adherents of the first position might be inclined to state that there are two different , yet equivalent , viewpoints of the same phenomena . in regards to noc , a common argument is provided in the following quote .",

    "it is instructive to examine the latest such attempt to see how this program fails .",
    "* in his more recent book on concepts of mass@xcite , max jammer delves extensively into the numerous arguments related to relativistic mass .",
    "the conclusion reached is that both formalisms are valid and that the difference is `` ultimately the disparity between two competing views of the development of physical science . '' to this end he cites the work of b. v. landau and s. samanthapar@xcite in which the addition of velocity relation and lorentz transformation are said to be derived from newtonian mechanics and the relativistic mass formula alone .",
    "as jammer puts it `` the fact that the lorentz transformation and relativistic mass equation mutually imply one another seems to indicate that the relation between these two is more intimate than commonly thought '' .",
    "this result would formally show the validity of relativistic mass as a possible basis for special relativity , thus making the rm formalism and the geometric formalism complementary views of special relativity .",
    "a close examination of landau and samanthpar s derivation finds that the hyperbolic geometry of spacetime is the basis for their result and not the relativistic mass formula . by considering conservation of momentum in a simple two - particle process",
    ", the authors implicitly invoke the geometry of spacetime by redefining , without explanation , the velocities as hyperbolic tangents ( i.e. @xmath2 , etc . ) .",
    "then by relying on hyperbolic trigonometric relations , hyperbolic spacetime has been introduced , automatically yielding the relation they desire@xcite .",
    "thus this derivation does not provide a basis for jammer s claim since the lorentz transformation arises from the geometry and not from the relativistic mass formula .    to support his claim further",
    ", jammer derives the relativistic mass relation from the lorentz transformation .",
    "however his derivation is , at the outset , set up to give a relativistic mass once the spatial components of the 4-momentum are defined .",
    "for all agree ( modulo interpretations of @xmath3 ) that the lorentz transformations yield a 4-momentum that must be of the form , @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "this derivation precludes the interpretation of a proper 4-velocity , @xmath6 , that stems from g and which results in ( [ 4mom ] ) without need for relativistic mass .",
    "thus the derivation does not prove the claim that the lorentz transformations unequivocally lead to a relativistic mass , nor does it lend credence to the idea that these two concepts are intimately related .",
    "v. petkov has just written a text on special relativity@xcite in which he endeavors to give a consistent ontological foundation of spacetime .",
    "though more philosophical in nature , it is a serious exposition but does ascribe to a more radical rm viewpoint :  it should be stressed that the resistance arises _ in _ the particle ; it does not come from the geometric properties of spacetime . \"",
    "as this argument is different in nature to most others , and rather intricate , a detailed exploration will need to be done at a later time .",

    "the reason stems from the early history of special relativity , especially the efforts of lewis and tolman@xcite@xcite@xcite , that were picked up by later authors@xcite@xcite@xcite . just as in jammer s case above , these derivations posit a newtonian form for the 3-momentum , @xmath12 and then impose conservation of momentum .",
    "naturally the result found is that the new relativistic expression for momentum , that is lorentz covariant , must be of the form ( [ 4mom ] ) . from his derivation , tolman ( 1912 , as cited in jammer@xcite ) makes the bold assertion that `` the expression @xmath13 is best suited for the mass of a moving body '' .",
    "* breaks lorentz covariance . * by asserting ( [ rmmom ] ) as the definition of relativistic momentum , one is forced to adopt a primitive concept of an improper 4-velocity ; for @xmath14 is not lorentz covariant .",

    "* _ relatively speaking _ by eric chaisson@xcite + on page 62 of this pedestrian introduction to relativity there is a series of three illustrations of a girl standing on a scale .",
    "the intent is to convey observations when she is at rest and travelling at two different speeds ( labeled `` fast '' and `` faster '' ) .",
    "the girl is seen to lorentz contract as expected and the scale indicates her weight to increase  the needle points to successively higher values .",
    "this is exactly the type of misconception that is reinforced by this concept . if this image is to represent the girl in various irfs then the needle pointing to different weights violates the primal nature of events , one of the most basic tenets of relativity . *",
    "_ space and time in the modern universe _ by p.c.w .",
    "davies@xcite + on page 45 there is depicted a stick figure , holding a string with a ball on the end , standing on a scale indicating 1 kg .",

    "the manner in which the ball was set into motion is not stated .",
    "if an outside agent set it in motion then there is no controversy that the mass of the isolated person - ball system has increased .",
    "the rm viewpoint is that the energy input went into the kinetic energy of the ball plus its mass increase while the g viewpoint is that the energy went to the kinetic energy alone . if the person sets the ball in motion ( which seems to be the implication ) , then there is no valid interpretation of the depiction , for energy ( and hence mass ) is conserved for this isolated system .",
    "this last example leads to a subtle point about the definition of mass and the definition of object ( or system of objects ) and is stated by some@xcite@xcite to be a pitfall of the non - rm viewpoint .",
    "however , the definition of the mass of a system as the proper energy divided by @xmath30 regardless of the motion of the system s center of mass  is clearly described by einstein@xcite .",
    "the energy of an object as measured in other frames of reference is not inherent to the object itself ( is not proper ) .",
    "there are no conceptual inconsistencies with this approach ( see harris@xcite for a clear textbook treatment ) .",
    "the two viewpoints of kinetic energy lead to a differing ontology of spacetime . @xmath31 the divergence of kinetic energy as light speed is approached has its cause in the diverging mass in the rm viewpoint and the geometry of spacetime in the g viewpoint .",

    "more vocal calls for the abandonment of relativistic mass are clearly needed",

    "is it possible to have a completely consistent velocity - dependent mass integrated into the full theory of relativity ?",
