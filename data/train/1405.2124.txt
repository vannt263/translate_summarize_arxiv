    "the accuracy of extragalactic distance measurements ultimately depends on robust , high - precision determinations of the distances to the galaxies in the local group .",
    "this is , of course , the basis of the concept of the astronomical `` distance ladder '' ( for an up - to - date , modern version of the distance ladder , see de grijs 2013 ) .",
    "in particular , distance measurements to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have played an important role in constraining the value of the hubble constant , @xmath2 .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ key project ( hstkp ) on the extragalactic distance scale ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) estimated @xmath3 ( statistical ) @xmath4 ( systematic ) km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "most notably , the @xmath6% systematic uncertainty affecting their determination of @xmath2 was said to be predominantly driven by the remaining systematic uncertainties in the assumed distance to the lmc prevalent at that time ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; schaefer 2008 ; pietrzyski et al . 2013 ) .    yet , the accuracy of lmc distance determinations has been dogged by persistent claims of `` publication bias '' ( e.g. , schaefer 2008 , 2013 ; rubele et al . 2012 ; walker 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2014 ; henceforth paper i ) we re - analyzed the full body of lmc distance measurements published between 1990 and 2013 .",
    "we concluded that strong publication bias is unlikely to have been the main driver underlying the clustering of many published lmc distance moduli .",
    "however , we found that many of the published values were based on highly non - independent tracer samples and analysis methods . in turn , this has led to significant correlations among the body of lmc distances published since 1990 . the earlier conclusion that the tight clustering of published values and the reduction in the spread observed in recent years",
    "may have been due to publication bias was , in essence , based on inappropriate application of the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test to a data set that ultimately did not meet the requirements for such tests : ks tests are only applicable to samples that consist of independent and identically distributed values . in the context of lmc distance measurements ,",
    "both constraints are violated .",
    "these violations originate , in particular , from progress in data analysis , enlarged tracer samples , and improvements in both our theoretical understanding and in the model implementation of theoretical stellar evolution scenarios , which all drive down the uncertainties in the derived parameters ( including distance moduli ) and lead to more consistent results .",
    "we now extend our distance range of interest to include published distance moduli to m31 , a few of its companion galaxies , and a few other well - known local group members in order to assess whether or not these measurements may be affected by publication bias or correlations among the methods employed to obtain them ( cf .",
    "dalcanton et al .",
    "more importantly , however , we aim at reaching consensus on the best , most homogeneous , and internally most consistent set of local group distance moduli to adopt for future , more general use . combined with the results of paper i",
    ", we aim at determining whether the distance scale in the local group as a whole may need further revision .",
    "the present series of papers is based on the largest set of distance determinations to local group galaxies available to date , which we have assessed carefully in the context of an analysis of population - specific properties and biases never done to the same extent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ data.sec ]",
    "we outline our approach to compiling our database of distance measurements . in section [ m31dist.sec ]",
    "we explore in detail the trends , if any , in the distance measurements to m31 .",
    "we pay particular attention to the calibration relations used to arrive at the m31 distances based on variable star tracers : see section [ calibration.sec ] .",
    "we subsequently focus our analysis on a number of m31 companion galaxies , as well as a few other well - known local group members ( section [ m31group.sec ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions.sec ] we summarize and place our results in the broader context .",
    "we conclude with our recommendations as to which distances to local group galaxies constitute a homogeneous , internally consistent set .",
    "to compile our m31 distance database , we relied entirely on the nasa / astrophysics data system ( ads ) compilation of the published literature , in the absence of suitable comprehensive databases we might use as our basis ( but see vilardell et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we checked all of the nearly 13,000 articles published as of late january 2014 and which contained references to m31 in the nasa / ads compilation for references to newly determined distances to the galaxy .",
    "our comprehensive search resulted in a total of 168 distance measurements to m31 or components associated with the galaxy s main body .",
    "we did not include determinations of the distances to the large population of accompanying dwarf galaxies ( but see section [ groupmembers.sec ] ) .",
    "only very few ( @xmath75 ) of the more recent determinations include separate analyses of the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the published measurements .",
    "our final database , sorted as function of both publication date and distance tracer , is available from http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html .",
    "its structure is similar to that used for our lmc distances database presented in paper i.    among the 117 newly determined distance moduli published since 1990 , which we take as the period of interest for our main analysis , only three appeared in non - refereed publications .",
    "for the same reasons as justified in paper i , we opted to retain these measurement so as to avail ourselves of a complete publication record .",
    "three articles ( rich et al . 2005 ; mackey et al . 2006 ; perina et al .",
    "2009 ) reported distance measurements to individual globular clusters ( gcs ) associated with m31 .",
    "we calculated the average values for each of these three data sets ( containing 19 , 4 , and 11 gcs each , respectively ) , which we will use for further analysis in the remainder of this paper .",
    "specifically , we obtained @xmath8 mag , @xmath9 mag , and @xmath10 mag for the mean distances based on the individual gc measurements reported in rich et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , mackey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and perina et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties quoted above reflect the spread among the individual gc distances ( i.e. , the depth of the m31 gc system ) , as well as the typical photometric uncertainty , which we added in quadrature .",
    "since we aim at establishing a robust set of benchmark distances within the local volume , we selected a number of additional local group members of different types .",
    "in addition to the third largest spiral galaxy in the local group , m33 , we selected m31 s close , late - type companion m32 ( classified as a compact elliptical - type galaxy ) , the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph)/dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxy pair ngc 147/ngc 185 , as well as the dsph / de galaxy ngc 205 ( m110 ) , the dwarf irregular object ic 10 , and the irregular galaxy ic 1613 .",
    "all of these galaxies host a variety of tracers that can be used for accurate distance determinations  each affected by its own systematic uncertainties  and cross - calibration among the different tracers .",
    "the inclusion of ic 1613 is particularly interesting from the perspective of metallicity differences : the galaxy s cepheids , for instance , are characterized by a significantly different metallicity compared with their galactic counterparts , @xmath11 } \\simeq 1 $ ] dex ( for a discussion , see e.g. majaess et al .",
    "the full database of newly reported distance measurements to each of our sample galaxies can be accessed at http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html .    at the time of the completion of our online database , in late january 2014 , the nasa/ ads contained 6008 articles that referred to m33 , as well as 2256 , 576 , 758 , 1299 , 998 , and 1057 articles containing references to m32 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , ngc 205 , ic 10 , and ic 1613 , respectively .",
    "our exhaustive exploration of these @xmath712,000 publications led to inclusion of a total of 131 newly reported distances to m33 since records began in 1926 , as well as 38 to m32 ( since 1944 ) , and 37 , 54 , 43 , 46 , and 145 distance estimates to , respectively , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , ngc 205 , ic 10 , and ic 1613 .",
    "the most commonly available distance tracers include cepheids ( m33 , ngc 205 , ic 10 , and ic 1613 ) and rr lyrae ( m32 , m33 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 ,",
    "ngc 205 , and ic 1613 ) variable stars , as well as features associated with bright giant stars , such as the level of the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ; m32 , m33 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , ngc 205 , and ic 1613 ) or the red clump ( rc ; m32 , m33 , and ic 1613 ) , and the technique of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ; m32 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 ; for ic 10 , an equivalent approach was taken by yahill et al . 1977 ) .",
    "m33 is the only object among this additional sample of local group galaxies for which we have access to two types of independent , _ geometric _ distance determinations , based on water masers ( greenhill et al .",
    "1993 ; argon et al .",

    "figure [ m31dist.fig ] shows the distribution of published distance moduli , corrected for extinction by their respective authors , since the first bold attempts by van maanen ( 1918 ; with references to earlier work ) , lundmark ( 1919 ) , and luplau - janssen & haarh ( 1922 ) to measure a trigonometric parallax to the galaxy . following subsequent attempts to use galaxy dynamics to derive a distance ( jeans 1922 ;",
    "pik 1922 ) , hubble ( 1922 , 1925a , b , 1929a , b ) and lundmark ( 1923 , 1925 ; and references therein ) were the first to use individual objects in m31 as tracers of the system s distance as a whole .",
    "they used classical novae and cepheid variable stars , respectively , which were easily accessible with telescopes that were available at the time because of these objects intrinsically high luminosities .",
    "it is , therefore , not a surprise that to date the largest number of newly reported distance measurements to m31 based on individual tracers ( 42 ) are based on cepheid calibrations .",
    "a casual inspection of figure [ m31dist.fig ] reveals that the distance to m31 has been known to within @xmath12% , given the sometimes sizeable uncertainties , since the 1960s .",
    "the average distance modulus has been slowly increasing until the mid-1980s , when it leveled off near a value of @xmath13 mag , with a typical uncertainty of @xmath140.2 mag . in this paper",
    ", we are particularly interested in exploring any more recent trends in the average distance modulus , specifically during the `` modern '' period from 1990 until the present time .",
    "( the precise choice of starting date of our modern period is not important , provided that we have access to a sufficiently long time span that would allow us to discern any statistical trends . )",
    "therefore , we will not discuss the m31 distance tracers based on nova- or supernova - related light - curve features , since all of the latter were published prior to 1990 . in the remainder of this and in the next section",
    ", we will examine whether the individual distance moduli published during this period may have been based on either correlated data or model approaches , or perhaps been subject to publication bias .",
    "we follow a similar approach as in paper i. in figure [ m31dist2.fig ] we expose our time - restricted data set to further scrutiny .",
    "the top panels in this figure show the annual and biennial averages ( as well as the number of data points considered ) of all distance measurements pertaining to the full period from 1990 until 2013 .",
    "we specifically highlight the levels of the distance moduli determined by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , i.e. , the `` canonical '' distance modulus of @xmath15 mag , and that of mcconnachie et al .",

    "the arrows indicate the publication dates of our two benchmark distance moduli , where the colors correspond to the relevant horizontal dashed lines . at first sight",
    ", it does not appear that following the publication of either of our benchmark distance moduli the average levels converged to the respective values .",
    "figures [ m31dist2.fig]e through [ m31dist2.fig]h include the individual distance measurements for four types of common distance tracers , i.e. , cepheid and rr lyrae variable stars , red giants , and color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) fits .",
    "the individual distance moduli , sorted by tracer , are available at http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html . except for the red giant - based distances",
    ", we do not discern any clear trends among the individual measurements . as regards the red giants ,",
    "although their average level does not vary significantly as a function of publication year , the associated uncertainties shrink quite significantly from 1990 until the present time .",
    "the red giant - based distances in figure [ m31dist2.fig]g are predominantly based on measurements of the tip of the trgb magnitude , except for two values based on rc observations .",
    "the observed reduction in the distance moduli based on this distance tracer is reminiscent of the situation for the lmc distance moduli based on rc data ( paper i ) . of the 10 articles using the trgb magnitude as their distance tracers ,",
    "six are based on newly obtained , independent observations .",
    "the remaining four articles ( ferrarese et al . 2000 ; sakai et al . 2004 ; saha et al .",
    "2006 ; rizzi et al . 2007 )",
    "use a subset of observations discussed in the six independent articles ; all of these articles base at least part of their analyses on the published data of mould & kristian ( 1986 ) .",
    "their calibration relations are largely independently determined based on either empirical or theoretical ( stellar evolution ) considerations .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no compelling reason to assume a significant contribution from publication bias to the bulk of present - day m31 distance moduli .",
    "we suggest that the observed clustering of the trgb - based data points is likely related to our improved understanding of the details of stellar evolution .",
    "this is corroborated by the notion that the trgb magnitudes used as calibration benchmarks span a very narrow range in absolute @xmath19-band magnitude .",
    "the main uncertainties associated with the use of the trgb as a distance indicator are therefore related to the way in which the trgb magnitude is detected .",
    "however , given that modern approaches are based on very large numbers of stars , edge - detection techniques run into few difficulties in this regard .",
    "this is exemplified by the small scatter in the resulting distance estimates to m31 shown in table [ stats.tab ] . in the next section , we will examine the distance moduli resulting from the use of period  luminosity relations ( plrs ) of variable stars , as well as calibration issues specific to m31 and the converging trends of the average distance moduli over time .",
    "to assess whether the post-1990 cepheid- and rr lyrae - based distance determinations to m31 have been largely independent or instead been subject to significant correlations among data sets , zero - point calibrations , and methods employed , we carefully examined the origins of the individual distance determinations .",
    "we considered 20 publications yielding m31 distance moduli based on cepheid light curves , as well as eight articles based on rr lyrae variables ( for details , see our online database ) .",
    "close examination of these 28 papers revealed that more than two thirds ( 14 cepheid- and six rr lyrae - based distance determinations ) of recent m31 distance estimates rely on the lmc s distance as their calibration benchmark .",
    "one article , majaess et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , reports a distance modulus based on analysis of type ii cepheid light curves ; this distance estimate is discrepant at the 1.52@xmath20 level with respect to all other modern cepheid - based m31 distance measurements .",
    "this is likely owing to the criterion these authors adopted to distinguish between classical and type ii cepheids .",
    "as they show in their figures 1 and 2 , in m31 the transition between the two different types is rather smooth , thus rendering a clear distinction between both cepheid types uncertain . because of this issue and the intrinsically different nature of the objects considered by majaess et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we will not include this result in the ensuing discussion .",
    "( note that although type ii cepheids originate from the same old stellar population as rr lyrae stars , a comparison of this latter data point with the mean value defined by the rr lyrae distance moduli leads to a similarly discrepant result . )",
    "although 12 of the 19 articles based on classical cepheids use @xmath21 mag as their calibration benchmark , the lmc distance moduli adopted by the various authors range from @xmath22 to 18.54 mag .",
    "this implies that the cepheid- and rr lyrae - based distance estimates shown in figure [ m31dist.fig]a , c , e , and f are not all based on the same distance scale .",
    "we thus proceeded to adjust the distance moduli of all cepheid- and rr lyrae - based determinations to a common lmc benchmark of @xmath21 mag .",
    "for the seven articles whose m31 distance estimates were not based on application of a relative m31lmc distance modulus , we checked the lmc distance moduli their resulting distances would be equivalent to ( many authors state these values , in fact , while in a few cases this amounted to a simple conversion ) .",
    "note that the discrepant type ii cepheid distance modulus of @xmath23 mag can not be made more consistent with the distance moduli based on classical cepheids by adjusting the adopted lmc distance , @xmath24 mag , to our benchmark value .",
    "figure [ m31dist3.fig ] is equivalent to figure [ m31dist3.fig ] , except that we have now `` corrected '' the relevant distance moduli to a common lmc benchmark modulus of 18.50 mag .",
    "figures [ m31dist3.fig]a and [ m31dist3.fig]c show the size of this effect in the context of the annual and biennial averages . once again , we do not see any significant trend(s ) for either the cepheid- or the rr lyrae - based distance determinations , although we note that there may be some hints of publication bias in the results , as reflected by the clustering  above or below the benchmark levels  of data points published close in time ( for cepheid - based distances , cf .",

    "we compare our set of benchmark distances to our sample of local group galaxies with those from a number of recent distance compilations .",

    "it is clear that all comparison data sets exhibit significant scatter in the relative distance moduli between many possible choices of pairs of sample galaxies , even considering the published error bars .",
    "we remind the reader that our weighted means ( as well as the trgb - based distances ) are based on the largest data set of distance measurements available to date , with particular emphasis on converging trends in more recent years and a careful analysis of the contributions from the different tracer populations . the data set that exhibits the closest match to our set of benchmark distances",

    "de grijs 2013 ) .",
    "the technique of very long baseline interferometry is also increasingly used to measure extragalactic proper motions . in turn , this enables geometric distance determination out to some 100 mpc , including to the nearby galaxies ngc 4258 , m33 , ugc 3789 , and ngc 6264 .",
    "combined with _ a priori _ information on a galaxy s inclination with respect to our line of sight and its rotation curve , based on radial velocity measurements , we can construct an accurate , slightly warped `` tilted - ring '' model of the galaxy s dynamical structure , usually assuming circular orbits ( although this assumption does not result in major systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "this , in turn , allows correlation of the angular proper motion measurements with the rotational velocity information obtained in linear units and , thus , provides an independent distance measurement .",
    "simultaneously , the megamaser cosmology project ( e.g. , reid et al . 2009 , 2013 ; braatz et al .",
    "2010 ) aims at using extragalactic maser sources to directly measure @xmath2 in the hubble flow , which is clearly a very challenging endeavor at distances in excess of 100 mpc !",
    "their preliminary results look promising , however : using ngc 6264 ( @xmath41 mpc ) as a benchmark , they find @xmath42 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( kuo et al .",
    "2013 ) , which is indeed very close to the current best determinations of @xmath2 based on a variety of independent measures .",
    "this thus looks like a promising way forward to eventually build a robust distance ladder out to the hubble flow .",

    "<S> the accuracy of extragalactic distance measurements ultimately depends on robust , high - precision determinations of the distances to the galaxies in the local volume . following our detailed study addressing possible publication bias in the published distance determinations to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , here we extend our distance range of interest </S>",
    "<S> to include published distance moduli to m31 and m33 , as well as to a number of their well - known dwarf galaxy companions . </S>",
    "<S> we aim at reaching consensus on the best , most homogeneous , and internally most consistent set of local group distance moduli to adopt for future , more general use based on the largest set of distance determinations to individual local group galaxies available to date . based on a careful , statistically weighted combination of the main stellar population tracers ( cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and the magnitude of the tip of the red - giant branch ) , we derive a recommended distance modulus to m31 of @xmath0 mag  adopting as our calibration an lmc distance modulus of @xmath1 mag  and a fully internally consistent set of benchmark distances to key galaxies in the local volume , enabling us to establish a robust and unbiased , near - field extragalactic distance ladder . </S>"
