    ".    we know little about the formation of galaxy bulges , due in part to conflicting evidence regarding our own bulge ( see zoccali 2010 ) . from a populations perspective",
    ", our bulge looks like a `` classical '' bulge  similar to an old , nearly coeval elliptical galaxy . from a morphological perspective , our bulge looks like a `` pseudo - bulge , '' with a peanut shape apparently arising from bar - driven secular processes . as summarized by kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) , a range of mechanisms may contribute to bulge formation , with rapid processes in discrete events ( e.g. , dissipative collapse , mergers of clouds and proto - galaxies ) dominating in the early universe , and secular processes ( interactions between stars , gas clouds , bars , spiral structure , triaxial halos , etc . ) dominating at later times .",
    "in broad terms , we see classical bulges if the earlier rapid processes are dominant , and pseudo - bulges if the later slower processes are dominant . however , a new paradigm has recently emerged , driven by observations at @xmath3 , that reveal the widespread existence of large , rotating , disk galaxies with much higher gas fractions compared to local spirals ( genzel et al .",
    "2008 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "such gas - rich , clumpy disks are prone to instabilities that can lead to bulge formation at early cosmic epochs and over timescales much shorter than those traditionally associated with secular instabilities in local spirals ( e.g. , immeli et al .",
    "2004 ; elmegreen et al .  2009 ) .",
    "these processes should imprint distinct age and metallicity gradients upon the bulge stellar populations .",
    "for example , bulge evolution dominated by secular processes ( such as bar instabilities ) is not expected to produce radial metallicity gradients , but is expected to produce younger stars in the bulge outskirts ( see zoccali 2010 and references therein ) .    to shed light on these processes",
    ", our wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program uses the new panchromatic capabilities of _ hst _ to probe the bulge stellar populations as a function of position ( brown et al .",
    "one of these bulge fields includes 13 candidate exoplanet hosts discovered via the sweeps transit survey ( sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) , and so our photometry can also demonstrate where these hosts fall within the bulge metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) . because wfc3 is a relatively new addition to _ hst _ , the full analysis of these data will require improvements in the calibration pipeline , data reduction , and analysis techniques , but we present here a look at preliminary results from our program .",

    "wfc3 has two imaging channels : a uvis channel comprised of two 4k@xmath42k uv / optical ccds , and an ir channel employing a single 1k@xmath41k hgcdte array .",
    "we observed these bulge fields with five channel / filter combinations : uvis / f390w ( hereafter @xmath5 ; exposure time 11180 s ) , uvis / f555w ( @xmath6 ; 2283 s ) , uvis / f814w ( @xmath7 ; 2143 s ) , ir / f110w ( @xmath8 ; 1255 s ) , and ir / f160w ( @xmath9 ; 1638 s ) .",
    "the bulge images were dithered to allow 2@xmath42 resampling of the point spread function ( psf ) ; because the ir channel has a smaller field of view ( @xmath10 ) than the uvis channel ( @xmath11 ) , additional offsets provided ir coverage of the full uvis image area . as part of this program ,",
    "we also observed six star clusters in the same filters , although with less exposure time and little dithering ; the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are much noisier than the bulge cmds , but sufficient to determine ridge lines and calibrate isochrone transformations .",

    "( 2009 ) , our five photometric bands can be combined to provide reddening - free indices of temperature [ @xmath18 and metallicity [ @xmath19 in the stellar population .",
    "specifically , for a given extinction law ( parameterized by @xmath20 ) , the [ fe / h ] inferred from these indices varies by only @xmath00.1 dex when @xmath15 varies by a magnitude ( see figures 3 and 4 of brown et al .",
    "2009 ) . for old ms stars reddened with a galactic average extinction law ( fitzpatrick 1999 ; @xmath21 )",
    ", these indices can be defined as :    @xmath22 \\equiv ( v - j ) - 5.8 \\times ( j - h)\\ ] ]    and @xmath23 \\equiv ( c - v ) - 0.90 \\times ( v - i).\\ ] ]    however , significant deviations from the galactic average extinction law will shift the distribution in the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane , because the coefficients in these indices depend upon the reddening vectors in each color .",
    "such shifts are expected here , because sumi ( 2004 ) has found significant variations in @xmath24 toward galactic bulge fields . the large coefficient ( 5.8 ) in the [ @xmath18 index makes it particularly sensitive to random and systematic errors in @xmath25 . to facilitate the comparison of the populations in each field",
    ", we applied a correction for this variation in extinction law before calculating the [ @xmath19 and [ @xmath18 indices .",
    "we derived these color shifts by comparing the ms loci of the bulge populations in cmds of @xmath5 vs. @xmath26 , @xmath6 vs. @xmath27 , @xmath7 vs. @xmath28 , and @xmath8 vs. @xmath25 .",
    "although the color distribution within the ms locus varies from field to field , the characteristic shape and boundaries of the ms locus in each field exhibit little variation , such that our shifts allow the loci to be aligned in color to an accuracy of @xmath00.01  mag . to this end , we aligned the ms locus in each field to that in baade s window .",
    "the implied extinction curve , when compared to the galactic average ( @xmath21 ) with both normalized at the red end ( @xmath9 ) , differs by less than 0.1  mag in any band , and by less than 0.02  mag if @xmath29 .",
    "note that our extinction law corrections are completely empirical ; they are consistent with a somewhat lower @xmath30 at decreasing distance from the galactic center , but do not allow us to derive the actual value of @xmath30 at an interesting level of confidence .",
    "we assume that the extinction law varies little within the relatively small _ hst _ field of view .",
    "once the variation in extinction law is corrected ( see  3.2 ) , we can compare the mdfs in each field . to restrict the analysis to a relatively narrow temperature range where the indices are well - behaved , we selected stars between the msto and a point 2.5  mag fainter in @xmath6 ( figure 1 ; _ dashed lines _ ) .",
    "these relatively bright stars are also well above the detection limits in each field , with small photometric errors due to photon counts and stellar crowding .    the distributions in the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane for each field are shown in figure 2 .",
    "for comparison , we show the expectations from a set of 10  gyr isochrones spanning a wide range in [ fe / h ] ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , transformed into the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane using the nextgen grid of synthetic spectra ( hauschildt et al .  1999 ; updated ) .",
    "we note that new evolutionary tracks and isochrones , accounting for helium diffusion and recent advances in basic stellar physics , are being computed for application to these data ( by d.a.v . ) . as with the photometry ,",
    "the isochrones are shown from the msto to a point 2.5  mag fainter in @xmath6 .",
    "spectroscopy of the bulge population indicates significant enhancement in [ @xmath31/fe ] at low metallicity , trending to less enhancement as one approaches [ fe / h]@xmath32 ( lecureur et al .",
    "2007 ) . to mimic that trend ,",
    "our chosen isochrones assume [ @xmath31/fe]=0.3 for [ fe / h]@xmath33 and [ @xmath31/fe]=0.0 for [ fe / h]=0.5",
    ". the synthetic spectra assume the same @xmath31-enhancement , but are interpolated from spectra with [ @xmath31/fe ] values of 0 , 0.2 , and 0.4 .",
    "loci of constant metallicity form approximately parallel lines in the diagram , with [ @xmath19  =  [ @xmath34  @xmath35[@xmath18 , such that interpolation between these lines provides a metallicity estimate for each star .",
    "the derived mdfs are shown in figure 2 ( _ histogram insets _ ) . in baade",
    "s window , our mdf at [ fe / h]@xmath36 is similar to that of zoccali et al .",
    "( 2008 ; from spectroscopy of giants ) but has more stars at lower metallicities .",
    "the inner fields ( stanek s window and sweeps ) exhibit a distinctly bimodal distribution of color in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath37 cmds ( figure 1 ) , while the outer fields ( baade s window and ogle29 ) exhibit a bimodal distribution in the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane ( figure 2 ) , which is reflected in the inferred mdfs .",
    "this is due to the nonlinear relationship between the indices , traditional cmd colors , and chemical composition .",
    "if the position in the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane is taken as an indication of metallicity , the stars at [ fe / h]@xmath38 overwhelmingly lie in the prominent red ridge of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath37 cmds , while the stars at [ fe / h]@xmath39 tend to lie in the weaker blue ridge of these cmds .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) discussed the advantages of the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 diagram regarding depth effects , but made no mention of binaries . in a cmd ,",
    "depth blurs the photometric distribution along the ordinate , blurring the inferred mdf when comparing to isochrones , but a color - color diagram is insensitive to depth . in a cmd ,",
    "binaries are brighter and redder than the single - star sequence ; comparison of binaries to isochrones can thus overestimate their metallicities . in our color - color diagram ,",
    "a companion of either equal or much lower mass will not shift the position of the primary , but a companion that is only somewhat fainter and cooler will artificially shift the implied metallicity lower ( i.e. , opposite to the cmd effect ) .",
    "this is because the secondary has a larger impact on [ @xmath18 than [ @xmath19 .",
    "the metallicities of any binaries in our field can be underestimated by up to @xmath00.3  dex .    from a strictly statistical perspective",
    ", a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicates that no pair of these fields has populations drawn from the same distribution ; the chance is 3% for the populations in the sweeps field and baade s window , and @xmath401% for any other pair .",
    "the mdfs in the two innermost fields ( stanek s window and sweeps ) are similar in appearance , although the metallicity appears to be shifted to slightly lower [ fe / h ] in the sweeps field .",
    "progressing outward , baade s window and the ogle29 field each exhibit more stars shifting to lower metallicities , with the mdfs appearing more bimodal than that in the interior fields , due to a stronger presence of relatively metal - poor stars .",
    "taking the relationship between indices and [ fe / h ] at face value , the fraction of stars with super - solar metallicities drops as one progresses outward through the fields : stanek s window ( 41% ) , sweeps ( 39% ) , baade s window ( 38% ) , and ogle29 ( 35% ) .",
    "rich et al .  ( 2007 ) found no gradient in the bulge metallicity when comparing the spectroscopic metallicities of 17 m giants in the inner bulge to 14 m giants in baade s window , but given their small sample , their result may be consistent with our findings .",
    "zoccali et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found the bulge to decrease in metallicity along the minor axis beyond 4@xmath41 .",
    "note that our measured mdf variation is for the general population in each field , and can not be investigated for the bulge in isolation without proper - motion cleaning of the foreground stars .",
    "we have used the trilegal galaxy model , with its default parameters ( girardi et al .",
    "2005 ) , to estimate that the foreground thin disk , thick disk , and halo together contribute 59% of the total population in each field , with higher contamination at increasing distance from the galactic center .",
    "we performed a preliminary proper - motion cleaning of the catalog in the sweeps field , by comparing our astrometry to that in sahu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and assuming the relative disk and bulge velocities of clarkson et al .",
    "this cleaning clearly reduces the presence of cmd features associated with the disk foreground ( e.g. , the blue plume above the old msto ) , but the mdf in the remaining bulge population is not significantly changed from that shown in figure 2 .",
    "the combination of isochrones and synthetic spectra employed in figure 2 was chosen because it spans nearly the full range of photometric indices in each field , demonstrating the nonlinear relationship between indices and [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , the zeropoint of the [ fe / h ] scale is uncertain at the level of 0.20.3 dex , depending upon the actual extinction law in baade s window ( changing @xmath30 by 0.1 shifts the implied [ fe / h ] by 0.1 dex ) , the assumed abundance pattern ( e.g. , [ @xmath31/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] , particularly at high [ fe / h ] ) , the photometric zeropoints , and the spectral library employed in the isochrone transformation . putting the empirical ridge lines of our star clusters (  2 ) in the same [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane would imply our assumed [ fe / h ] scale underestimates the true [ fe / h ] by @xmath00.20.3 dex down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath42 , and that our metallicity scale is degenerate at lower metallicities .",
    "the offset may be a real systematic error in our metallicity scale , but it may also be due to distinctions in the reddening law and/or abundance pattern between the cluster and bulge populations .",
    "the cluster photometry was not corrected for variations in extinction law in the same manner used for the bulge fields , because the ms locus for each cluster is very distinct from that in the bulge , given the single metallicity yet noisier photometry .",
    "our sweeps field includes 13 of the 16 candidate exoplanet hosts found in the _ hst _ transit survey of sahu et al .",
    "two of these 13 candidates are too faint and red to appear in our @xmath5 images , but the remaining 11 have photometry enabling their placement in the [ @xmath19 vs. [ @xmath18 plane for the general sweeps population ( figure 2 ; _ diamonds _ ) .",
    "two of these 11 candidates have radial velocities that support their planetary nature , and are highlighted in figure 2 ( _ filled diamonds _ ) . although the zeropoint for our assumed [ fe / h ] scale is uncertain at the level of @xmath00.20.3 dex ( see  3.3 ) , the relative [ fe / h ] measurements for the exoplanet hosts and the general population in the sweeps field are much more secure , because the same systematic uncertainties apply to both .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that the candidate exoplanet hosts predominantly fall in the metal - rich end of the bulge mdf  a population that is already skewed toward high metallicity . aside from a single candidate at the metal - poor end of the distribution ,",
    "the remaining 10 candidates are more metal - rich than half the population , with 7 in the top quartile .",
    "a ks test of the implied metallicities in the exoplanet hosts and general population indicates that the chance they are both drawn from the same parent population is less than 2% .",
    "we have performed a preliminary analysis of the data from our wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program . keeping in mind the various systematic uncertainties at this stage",
    ", our analysis of the dwarf stars supports the picture of the bulge gleaned from investigations of the brighter giant stars ( see zoccali 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "our ir photometry reaches the knee on the lower ms , and indicates that the population is predominantly old ( @xmath010  gyr ) in all of the bulge fields , with no obvious age gradient .",
    "the declining metallicities at increasing radius are seemingly inconsistent with the secular processes that are traditionally associated with the formation of a peanut - shaped bulge .",
    "our findings are consistent with a classical bulge formed via rapid dissipative collapse ( either monolithic or via the merger of independent components ) , but also consistent with a recently emerging formation paradigm , motivated by observations of gas - rich spirals at @xmath3 ( genzel et al .  2008 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this new paradigm",
    ", instabilities in gas - rich disks can drive early bulge formation over rapid timescales ( e.g. , immeli et al .  2004 ; elmegreen et al .  2009 ) .    of the hundreds of extrasolar planets discovered to date",
    ", most have been found in the solar neighborhood via radial - velocity measurements .",
    "a notable exception is the discovery of 16 candidate exoplanet hosts in the sweeps transit survey of the galactic bulge ( sahu et al .",
    "our multiband photometry of 11 of these hosts demonstrates that they fall almost exclusively at the high end of the mdf in this high - density , metal - rich field .",
