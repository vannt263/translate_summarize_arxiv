    "in the core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosion , neutrino ( @xmath8 ) heating is known as one of the main mechanisms for the explosion leading to the so - called @xmath8-driven explosion @xcite .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the neutrino sphere propagate the proto - neutron star ( pns ) .",
    "the first propagating region is a core part of the pns , whose density is believed to be about a few times of the normal nuclear density @xmath9 . during the propagation",
    ", neutrinos may interact with nucleons in dense nuclear matter through two different modes ; neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) .",
    "the former mediated by @xmath10 boson corresponds to the neutrino scattering , while the latter through @xmath11 bosons is the neutrino absorption with the emission of corresponding leptons .    after passing by the uniform density region , @xmath12",
    ", which density dissolves a crust of the pns into the core comprising a uniform plasma of nucleons and leptons , neutrinos enter into the crust region of the pns .",
    "this crust region is usually treated as two different parts , inner and outer crusts divided by the neutron drip density , @xmath13 . beyond this density ,",
    "neutrons drip out of finite nuclei presumed to be embedded as lattice structures in the outer crust of the neutron star .",
    "some of the interesting phenomena in the @xmath8 propagation inside the pns by a unique property of the neutrino come from the asymmetry between the neutrino scattering and absorption due to strong magnetic fields in the magnetar .",
    "for instance , the pulsar kick  @xcite and the spin deceleration  @xcite of the strongly magnetized neutron stars were shown to be closely associated with the asymmetry , according to detailed studies of the neutrino transport in dense matter by a relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) .    outside of the pns , emitted neutrinos",
    "interact also with the nuclei already produced by the s - process in the progenitor and/or the r - process in the explosion . around the si layer",
    ", the neutrinos may initiate the so called neutrino - proton ( @xmath14 ) process @xcite .",
    "namely , the anti - neutrino ( @xmath15 ) absorption in proton - rich environment may produce neutrons immediately captured by neutron - deficient nuclei , which affects the proton process ( p - process ) by the @xmath16 or @xmath17 reactions . in the o - ne - mg layer",
    ", whose density is assumed to be about @xmath18 , neutrino - induced reactions might play an important role of producing some p - nuclei , which are odd - odd neutron - deficient nuclei .",
    "for example , the cosmological origins of @xmath19ta and @xmath20la are believed to originate from the @xmath8-process  @xcite .",
    "other light nuclei abundances are also closely associated with the neutrino interactions in he - c layer  @xcite .    of course , the nuclear density outside the pns is not so dense compared to that of inside the pns .",
    "but , since the nucleons interacting with the neutrinos are strongly bound , properties of such a bound nucleon are expected to be modified from those in free space .",
    "therefore , if such a drastic change of nuclear density happens to the neutrino propagation , it would be of practical importance to investigate such medium effects or bound nucleon property changes on the neutrino propagation in both inside and outside of the pns .    moreover ,",
    "recently , strong evidences for the modification of the nucleon properties in a nuclear medium have been reported from the proton electromagnetic ( em ) form factors measured in polarized @xmath21 scattering on @xmath22o  @xcite and @xmath23he  @xcite at mami and jefferson lab , and also from the study of neutron properties in a nuclear medium through polarized @xmath24 scattering on @xmath23he in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the weak vector currents and em currents form iso - vector ( vector ) current , one may expect naturally the modification of the weak vector form factors in a similar way to the em form factors .",
    "in addition , the fact that the bound neutron in a nucleus is nearly stable while a free neutron decays via the weak interaction with the life time of about 880 s , implies that the dominant , axial vector form factor or axial coupling constant @xmath25 , in a nuclear medium is also to be modified and different from that in free space .",
    "thus , it is quite meaningful to investigate the change of the neutrino - induced reactions due to the modification of nucleon properties in a nuclear medium , in order to pin down the ambiguities inherent in the nucleon and/or nuclear structure on the interpretation of various neutrino reactions in the cosmos . for the study of the nuclear weak structure",
    ", one needs more refined nuclear models , because the nuclear reaction by the emitted neutrino energy from the pns , whose energy range is less than 100 mev , is sensitive on the collective motion of inside nucleons .    in our previous paper , we studied the medium effects on the neutrino reaction by charged current  @xcite . a large asymmetry between the neutrino and anti - neutrino reactions in a dense nuclear medium is predicted . in this study , we focus on the nc reaction with the density - dependent weak form factors estimated in the quark - meson - coupling model ( qmc )  @xcite . the model has been successfully applied to study the properties of hadrons in nuclear matter , finite nuclei and hypernuclei  @xcite . for more through understanding of the medium effects or the effects by the change of nucleon properties in a nuclear medium , the @xmath0 and @xmath7 reactions on the nucleon in nuclear matter @xcite as well as in @xmath3c",
    "are examined in detail .",
    "nuclear structure for @xmath3c is treated by quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa )  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii is devoted to explain the form factors used in this study .",
    "detailed discussions regarding the form factors in dense matter and their numerical results are addressed in appendix a and b. numerical results for the neutrino reaction via nc on the nucleon in nuclear matter and @xmath3c are presented in sec .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "by the standard electro - weak theory , the weak current operator @xmath26 used for the @xmath8-induced reaction takes a @xmath27 current form which has isoscalar and isovector parts for nc interaction  @xcite : @xmath28 with the weinberg angle @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are plus components of the isovector @xmath33 and @xmath34 by the isospin rotation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 and @xmath36 . strangeness contributions , which are isoscalar parts , could be considered at @xmath37 . for the charged current ( cc )",
    "interaction , only @xmath38 term is involved , so that the cc reaction is nearly independent of the strangeness content in a nucleon . for the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on the nucleon ,",
    "@xmath39 is exploited , while only @xmath40 is usually taken for the meson electro - production .    for a free nucleon ,",
    "the weak current operator comprises the vector , the axial vector and the pseudo scalar form factors , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 here we take the scalar form factor in the vectorial part and the axial tensor form factor in the axial part to be zero , because of the conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) and no existence of the second class current , respectively . by the cvc hypothesis with the inclusion of the isoscalar strange quark contributions @xmath45 ,",
    "the vector form factors for protons and neutrons @xmath46 are expressed as  @xcite : @xmath47 the axial form factor is given by @xmath48 where @xmath25 and @xmath49 are the axial coupling constant and the axial cut off mass , respectively .",
    "the sign , @xmath50 comes from the isospin dependence of the target proton ( neutron ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the axial form factor in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is just negative to the form factor elsewhere , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , because we take the @xmath51 sign for the @xmath52 in eq .",
    "although the ambiguity from the strangeness content in a nucleon still persists  @xcite , the contribution to total cross section is less than 10 % even in the quasi - elastic region  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not take the strangeness contribution into account in this work .    before applying to the neutrino reaction",
    ", we need to figure out the change of nucleon properties in a nuclear medium , such as the effective nucleon mass , the axial coupling constant , the weak form factors of the nucleon .",
    "those properties are calculated in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark mass in a hadron is generated by the quark condensate , @xmath53 , in vacuum , but the mass ( or @xmath53 ) in nuclear matter may be reduced from the value in vacuum because of the condensed scalar ( @xmath54 ) field depending on the nuclear density @xmath55 .",
    "the decrease of the quark mass then leads to the variation of baryon internal structures at the quark level .",
    "such effect are considered self - consistently in the qmc model .",

    "this large asymmetry for the @xmath7 and @xmath6 reactions due to the change in the nucleon properties in a nuclear medium , which was also found in the cc reaction  @xcite , can be understood by the last , helicity - dependent ( hd ) term in eq .",
