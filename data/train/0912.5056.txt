    "classical novae are a thermonuclear runaway event on a white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system , in which the wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter from the companion star .",
    "when the accreted matter reaches a critical value , hydrogen at the bottom of the wd envelope ignites to trigger a shell flash . just after the nova outburst",
    ", the envelope on the wd rapidly expands to a giant size and optically thick winds blow .",
    "then the photosphere gradually shrinks whereas the total luminosity is almost constant during the outburst .",
    "thus , the photospheric temperature @xmath7 increases with time .",
    "the main emitting wavelength region moves from optical to ultraviolet and finally to supersoft x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , classical novae become a transient supersoft x - ray source in a later phase of the outburst , but their x - ray detections are rather rare mainly because of sparse observing time of x - ray satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
