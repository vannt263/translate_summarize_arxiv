    "the study of dynamical processes on networks has become a huge interdisciplinary research area during the last decade @xcite .",
    "the characteristic features of many natural systems such as biological , social and computer systems ( the world wide web ) @xcite , and last but not least the molecular structure of materials can be described as complex networks @xcite .",
    "there is a huge amount of works addressing the random motions on networks and many models have been developed to capture the structural features of random motions on networks @xcite . in order to analyze dynamical processes on networks",
    ", it has been demonstrated that random walks are a highly useful concept to describe problems such as of exploration , search , navigation and propagation of information on networks @xcite . whereas normal random walks with emerging brownian motions have been widely used to describe the dynamics on networks , e.g. @xcite , and many others , it has turned out that many processes associated with long - range jumps on the network , can not be properly described by normal random walks allowing in a time - step only moves to connected nodes .",
    "many complex phenomena such as anomalous transport phenomena with long - range jumps in diffusion processes indeed can not be described by brownian motions .",
    "however , their power - law long - range jump characteristics can be described by lvy motions @xcite in the framework of lvy statistics where such stochastic processes include long - range moves and are in many cases described by continuous space fractional operators @xcite .",
    "further diffusion processes have been analyzed governed by a time - fractional fokker planck equation @xcite .",
    "the fractional calculus in the continuous space has become a standard tool to describe a large ensemble of interdisciplinary problems of complex behavior involving effects due to spatial long - range interactions .",
    "a prominent example is for instance the development of fractional quantum mechanics by laskin @xcite .",
    "depending on the functional spaces where these fractional operators are defined we find various definitions of fractional operators in the continuous space in the literature @xcite . whereas these fractional operators are obtained as convolutional integrals in a continuous space , the fractional calculus on discrete networks and lattices is less developed . an approach to define fractional differential operators on lattices",
    "is suggested by tarasov @xcite . beside the applications on diffusion problems on the lattice",
    ", the importance of fractional lattice models appears also for a description of fractional lattice vibrational phenomena , a generalization of crystal lattice dynamics .",
    "some initial steps towards such a fractional generalization generalization of nonlinear classical lattice dynamics has been introduced by laskin and zaslavsky @xcite . in a lattice dynamics model which defines by hamilton s variational principle the ` laplacian matrix ' which contains all constitutive information of the harmonic interparticle interactions , it is therefore desirable to develop a ` fractional generalization ' of the existing lattice dynamics approach @xcite .    in the context of markovian processes on networks ,",
    "the concept of ` fractional random walk on undirected networks ' generalizing the ` normal random walk ' was recently introduced by riascos and mateos @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the normal random walk where the walker can reach in one time - step only connected nodes , the fractional random walker is allowed to reach in one time - step any node in a connected network introducing a small world property to the network @xcite .",
    "it was found for different type of complex networks numerically , and for the cyclic ring explicitly , that the efficiency to navigate on networks is increased when the fractional random walk is chosen instead of a normal walk .",
    "moreover , the power law decay of the fractional laplacian matrix on sufficiently large 1d cyclic rings ( periodic one - dimensional lattices ) indicates in the context of fractional diffusion the emergence of lvy flights , @xcite and see also the analysis in @xcite .    inspired by the above findings where the fractional generalization of a network laplacian matrix introduces a small world property to large world networks , the fractional random walk dynamics opens a huge new interdisciplinary field which merits further studies .",
    "it is now highly desirable to better understand the mechanism of ` fast fractional navigation ' in a network .",

    "the advantage of these regular network systems is that they accessible to an explicit spectral analysis as the eigenspace is terms of bloch - vectors is explicitly available .",
    "in the present paper the fractional random walk versus normal random walk is analyzed by means of a fractional generalization of master equation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and analytical accessibility , we confine us in the present paper on rather simple species of regular undirected networks with constant degree for all nodes with special focus on @xmath5-dimensional periodic cubic lattices . in the @xmath5-dimensional cubic lattice",
    "we assume only next neighbor node connections , i.e. in any physical dimension @xmath8 each node has two connected neighbor nodes .",
    "thus the degree of all nodes is identically equal to @xmath9 .",

    "we evoke briefly some general basic features of time - discrete and time - continuous random walks on regular undirected networks in the framework of markovian process which we will need for the analysis of fractional random walks .    to define the ` fractional random walk ' a ` fractional master equation ' involving a fractional laplacian matrix @xmath1 as generator matrix for the time evolution is introduced ( section 4 ) .",

    "the fractional transition matrix and fractional return probabilities are dominated for large times @xmath6 by slowly relaxing long - wave modes modes leading to a characteristic @xmath7-decay ( sections 4.1 and 4.2 ) .",
    "the asymptotic expressions further recover known results for normal and fractional random walk on the 1d cyclic ring @xcite .    in order to obtain further characteristic information on the fractional random walk we introduce a green s matrix in section 4.3 which yields a convenient representation of the fundamental matrix @xmath4 , containing the fractional mean relaxation time ( kemeny constant ) for the fractional random walk .",
    "the representation for the fundamental matrix @xmath4 relates fractional random walks with normal random walks ( section 4.3 ) .",
