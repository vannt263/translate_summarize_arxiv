    "consequently , a proper understanding of both ccqe _ and _ cc@xmath0 on nuclei is essential for the reconstruction of the neutrino energy .",
    "this article addresses the questions outlined above in the framework of the gibuu transport model . after giving the necessary model details , we start with a general introduction of event classification in typical neutrino detectors and discuss how possible detection thresholds influence the measured spectra .",
    "we further discuss both ccqe and cc@xmath0 cross sections and their entanglement .",
    "finally , we investigate how nuclear effects influence the reconstruction of the neutrino energy .",
    "the presence of in - medium modifications and , in particular , final - state interactions inside the target nucleus requires the use of state - of - the - art theoretical methods for the extraction of elementary processes from experiments with nuclear targets ( see also the review by alvarez - ruso @xcite ) . for this aim",
    "we use the gibuu transport model @xcite , where the neutrino first interacts with a bound nucleon .",
