    "sub-5fs laser pulses were generated by spectral broadening of @xmath43fs ( fwhm ) laser pulses from a titanium - sapphire laser amplifier system , running at 5khz repetition rate , in a 1 m long hollow - core glass capillary , filled with neon , and subsequent recompression by several bounces from chirped mirrors .",
    "the electric field of the laser pulses can be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the pulse envelope and @xmath46 and @xmath6 are the light frequency and the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) , respectively .",
    "the few - cycle pulses , linearly polarized along the @xmath1-direction of our lab coordinate system , with their spectra centered around 750 nm , are directed into an ultra - high vacuum chamber ( background pressure @xmath47 mbar ) , where they are focused onto a supersonic molecular gas jet of randomly aligned acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) , ethylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath3 ) , or 1,3-butadiene ( c@xmath3h@xmath4 ) molecules by a spherical mirror with a focal length of 150 mm .",
    "the gas jet , propagating along the @xmath2-direction , was created by expanding the molecular gas samples , with a backing pressure of around 0.5bar ( depending on the molecular species ) , through a nozzle of 10@xmath48 m in diameter into a vacuum chamber at @xmath49 mbar operating pressure and subsequent two - stage skimming and differential pumping . to avoid smearing of the cep due to the gouy phase shift",
    "when the laser pulses propagate along the @xmath50-direction through the gas jet @xcite , which is @xmath51@xmath48 m in diameter , the jet is cut in width by an adjustable slit before it reaches the interaction region .",
    "this reduces the width of the jet to typically 30@xmath48 m .",
    "the laser focus is placed about half the rayleigh length before the center of the narrow jet .",
    "the rayleigh length is estimated as 150@xmath48 m .",
    "cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy ( coltrims ) @xcite is used to measure the three - dimensional momentum vector of fragment ions emerging from the interaction of a single molecule with a few - cycle laser pulse .",
    "the ions created by the laser pulses were guided over a distance of 5.7 cm by a weak homogeneous electric field of 16v / cm , applied along the axis of the spectrometer , @xmath1 , onto a multi - hit capable roentdek dld 80 detector ( 80 mm in diameter ) , equipped with position sensitive delay line anodes .",
    "the ion count rate was kept at 0.4 per laser shot in order to establish coincidence conditions , which ensure that all observed processes take place within a single molecule . from the measured time - of - flight and position of each detected ion",
    "we calculate its three - dimensional momentum vector in the lab frame @xcite .",
    "the peak intensity of the laser pulses on target was determined from separate calibration measurements using single ionization of argon atoms in circularly polarized light @xcite .    as in our experiments",
    "we measure the ion momenta of fragments from only one molecule created by ionization in a single laser pulse , it becomes possible to perform single - shot cep tagging @xcite : we measure the duration and the cep , @xmath6 , of each few - cycle laser pulse on a single - shot basis by exploiting the asymmetry of photoelectron spectra created by above - threshold ionization ( ati ) , emitted to the left and right along the laser polarization direction , using a stereo - ati phase - meter @xcite . in the offline data analysis",
    "each fragmentation event is then tagged with the corresponding cep - value determined from the photoelectron spectra @xcite . from the stereo - ati data we estimate the duration of our laser pulses as @xmath52fs full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .    as cep - measurement and coincidence measurement of fragment ions are performed in two separate apparatus , the laser beam , split into two arms , passes through different amounts of glass and air .",
    "thus , the cep - value determined from the stereo - ati phase - meter , @xmath6 , is offset by a constant value , @xmath53 , from the one of the pulses in the coltrims device , @xmath5 .",
    "we arbitrarily calibrated the cep in the coltrims device such that the mean momentum value of the singly charged molecular ion , which due to momentum conservation is the inverse of the electron momentum , peaks at @xmath54 and is zero at @xmath55 , see fig.1(g ) in the letter .",
    "this cep - dependence is predicted by the simple man s model ( smm ) of strong field physics @xcite , which neglects the influence of the long - range coulomb potential onto the departing electrons .",
    "due to the coulomb influence , depending on the atomic or molecular species and on the laser parameters , the cep - values at which the maxima of the mean momentum are observed , do not necessarily coincide with the predictions of the smm @xcite . as the coulomb influence and laser parameters are different for the separate measurements shown in the letter , @xmath53 might also be different for each of them .",
    "we would like to emphasize , though , that all explanations and conclusions given in the letter are unaffected by a constant cep - offset , @xmath56 .    from the measured data a certain two - body fragmentation pathway",
    "is uniquely identified using momentum conservation conditions in all three spatial dimensions @xcite . from all",

    "this state is dissociative along the c - h stretch ( and also along the @xmath69 distorting modes @xcite ) , leading to the fragmentation products h@xmath12/c@xmath0h@xmath12 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : surfaces](b ) .",
    "it is not immediately obvious , however , that the @xmath68 state is also dissociative along the c - c stretching mode , since the first excited triplet state has a symmetry - allowed level crossing with the higher excited @xmath70 state , see fig .",

    "breaking of the symmetry will inevitably happen since the state is dissociative along the antisymmetric c - h stretch motion , as well as for distortions from the linear geometry ( where the @xmath59 state splits up into two components with @xmath71 and @xmath72 symmetry , respectively ) . please note , that breakage of the c - c bond may also proceed via different electronic states .",

    "we can deduce that an excitation to the first few excited states , about 25 - 26ev above the cationic groundstate , will suffice to lead to a fragmentation into both fragmentation channels observed in the experiment .",
    "with the _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces @xmath73 and transition dipole moments @xmath74 calculated as described in section  [ sec : pes ] , we have performed quantum dynamical calculations , integrating numerically the time - dependent nuclear schrdinger equation in the presence of an intense , external laser field .",

    "<S> , we expect double ionization to occur predominantly via electron recollision . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : yield_modulation](g ) shows that ( i ) the measured momentum of c@xmath0h@xmath25 along the laser polarization direction is much larger than the one of c@xmath0h@xmath26 , and that ( ii ) the two momenta point into opposite directions for almost all cep - values . </S>",
    "<S> such cep - dependence has been shown to be caused by double ionization via electron recollision @xcite . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> as the sum momentum of the two emitted fragments shows the same dependence on the cep as c@xmath0h@xmath25 [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : yield_modulation](g ) ] , the fragmentation reactions are also initiated by recollision ionization ( ri ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the observed cep - dependence of the fragmentation yields is most likely due to a strong cep - dependence of ri into the first dissociative state .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : yield_modulation](a ) shifted by @xmath28 . ]    in order to elucidate this point we plot in fig.[fig : rec_proof](b ) the electron recollision energy in the few - cycle pulses used in our experiments on acetylene , for different cep - values as a function of birth time , calculated using the simple man s model @xcite . for this intensity ( @xmath29w/@xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the strongly cep - dependent maximum recollision energy of the dominant recollision event is only 22ev for @xmath30 , while for @xmath31 roughly 26ev are reached . about 20ev are necessary to reach the ground state of the acetylene dication , see fig.[fig : rec_proof](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> additional @xmath32ev are necessary to reach the first dissociative state that leads to the experimentally observed correlated fragments ch@xmath12/ch@xmath12 and c@xmath0h@xmath12/h@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the probability for reaching the dissociative state is highest for cep - values around @xmath33 , and small for ce - phases around @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose the following scenario [ see fig.[fig : rec_proof](a ) ] for explaining the pronounced fragmentation yield modulations observed in the experiment : an electronic wavepacket set free by field ionization dominantly from the homo of the neutral molecule , is driven back by the laser field and doubly ionizes the molecule by electron impact ionization . for cep - values that result in low recollision energy , </S>",
    "<S> the second electron will be dominantly removed from the homo , leading to ionization to the non - dissociative dication s ground state . </S>",
    "<S> for cep - values resulting in high recollision energy , the electron can also be removed from a lower lying orbital , which puts the molecular ion into a dissociative excited electronic state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , </S>",
    "<S> the excited state associated with the fragmentation products ch@xmath12/ch@xmath12 that we discussed above , is reached by removal of an electron from the homo-1 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> because the fragmentation reactions that we investigated in the present experiments take place on only one electronically excited state surface ( see supplemental material @xcite ) , whose population is controlled by the cep , we observe the same cep dependence for each fragmentation channel of a certain molecule ( fig.[fig : yield_modulation ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can test the proposed scenario experimentally simply by increasing the laser peak intensity @xmath35 , since the recollision energy scales linearly with intensity as @xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the recollision energy is high enough for all cep - values to reach the first dissociative state , the fragmentation yield is expected to be independent of the cep . </S>",
    "<S> figs.[fig : rec_proof](c ) and ( d ) show the measured yield as a function of cep of the same fragmentation channels as in figs.[fig : yield_modulation](a ) and ( b ) , but with a twice higher laser intensity leading to twice the maximum recollision energy . as expected , the fragmentation yields now show no discernible modulation with the cep . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by precise adjustment of the laser intensity , such that the energy threshold to the dissociative states is overcome only for certain cep - values , light - field control of the fragmentation of polyatomic molecules becomes possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig.[fig : rec_proof](e ) , for the example of the fragmentation channel c@xmath3h@xmath37 ch@xmath38 c@xmath16h@xmath13 , where the laser intensity has been fine - tuned in three steps over the dissociation energy threshold , resulting first in a decreased modulation depth of the fragmentation yield , and for even higher intensity in its complete disappearance .    to obtain detailed insight into the light - determined fragmentation dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we now turn to simulations ( detailed in the supplemental material @xcite ) , performed exemplary for acetylene , c@xmath0h@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , we use a one - dimensional semi - classical model to simulate recollision - ionization into the excited dissociative state . the resulting fragmentation probability as a function of cep and laser intensity </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_sim_exp](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> at very low laser intensities below roughly @xmath39 w/@xmath21 , the recollision energy of the electron is too small to reach the dissociative state , independent of the cep . for slightly higher intensities , </S>",
    "<S> lower lying electrons can be ionized by ri for certain values of the cep . with increasing intensity the cep values , where maximum fragmentation probability is reached , shift . at the same time , the modulation depth decreases [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_sim_exp](b ) ] , since for higher laser intensity and therewith higher electron recollision energy also recollisions for other cep values have enough energy to ionize a low lying electron . </S>",
    "<S> taking an average over @xmath27 w/@xmath21 , thereby simulating the different intensities within the experimental laser beam profile up to an intensity very close to the experimentally determined value , we obtain the modulation shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_sim_exp](c ) , which agrees almost perfectly with the experimental data shifted by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the cep - shift is attributed to the influence of the long - range coulomb field on the cep - dependent energy of electrons from single ionization @xcite , which we have used in our experiment to arbitrarily calibrate the cep , @xmath5 , and which is also not correctly reproduced in the one - dimensional semi - classical model .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical data shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_sim_exp ] have been calculated by neglecting field - driven population transfer between the binding ground state and the dissociative excited states , which in previous work on the dissociative ionization of d@xmath0/h@xmath0 @xcite has been shown to be essential in explaining the cep - dependent charge - localization observed in the experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> , we can exclude a noticeable contribution of such a mechanism to the experimentally observed cep - dependence of the fragmentation yield shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : yield_modulation ] , as it would be incompatible with the observation that for each of the molecules all fragmentation channels show the same cep - dependence . </S>",
    "<S> field - driven population dynamics , however , would happen on considerably different timescales for breakage of the c - c and h - c bonds , respectively , due to the large difference in the fragments reduced masses ( @xmath41 ) . in order to confirm this statement , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed reduced - dimensional quantum dynamical calculations by solving the time - dependent nuclear schrdinger equation for the four strongest dipole - coupled electronic states of acetylene subjected to the experimental laser parameters ( see supplemental material @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the field - driven population transfer to the cep - dependent modulation of the fragmentation yield due to recollision - induced ionization was found to be very small ( @xmath42 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> electron recollision , however , can not only promote the second electron directly into the continuum , but can also excite the molecular cation , which may then be further ionized by the laser field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that this mechanism , dubbed recollision - induced excitation ( re ) and subsequent field ionization ( resi ) , can , in principle , also be used for cep - control of polyatomic molecular fragmentation with few - cycle pulses even at peak intensities that prohibit direct population of the first excited dicationic state . in this case , however , as many of the closely spaced higher excited states in the cation can be populated by re , the cep - selectivity becomes dominantly dependent on the field - sensitive ionization rate during the field ionization step . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the yields of different fragmentation channels as well as the yield of the dication are likely to show different cep - modulation depths and possibly different cep - dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this is not observed in our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have estimated that at the intensity of our experiments and the channels observed , resi is considerably less probable than direct ri to the first dissociative excited state . we therefore conclude that the contributions to the observed cep - modulation of the fragmentation yield due to resi , while probably important for lower intensities , are insignificant for the here demonstrated higher intensity case that permits direct ri from lower lying orbitals .    in conclusion we have experimentally demonstrated for the first time control over various fragmentation reactions of polyatomic molecules using intense few - cycle laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> fragmentation reactions of polyatomic molecules are essential building blocks of chemistry . equally important , however , are preceding isomerization reactions . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we observe , for example , two channels that involve molecular restructuring prior to the breakage of a molecular bond : formation of h@xmath9 for ethylene and a proton migration reaction for 1,3-butadiene [ see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : yield_modulation ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that ri with intensity - tuned few - cycle laser pulses can be used as a very efficient tool not only to initiate ( or suppress ) fragmentation but also isomerization reactions in polyatomic molecules with high sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> our work , thus , demonstrates an efficient and selective , yet straightforward way of pre - determining fragmentation and isomerization reactions in polyatomic molecules on sub - femtosecond time - scales .    </S>",
