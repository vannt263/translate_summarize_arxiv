    "the light variability of npaquarii ( = hd198528=hip102935=nsv25363 ) was first suspected by tobin , viton & sivan ( 1994 ) during the spacelab-1 very wide field survey of uv - excess objects .",
    "this survey has revealed a variety of stellar objects with strong ultraviolet excess ( see , for example , viton et al .",
    "perryman et al . ( 1997 ) confirmed its light variation using the h@xmath4 magnitudes obtained by the hipparcos mission .",
    "the type of the light variability could not be classified with the available data .",
    "later on , otero ( 2003 ) gave the epoch of minimum light , the orbital period and the variability class using the asas-3 ( pojmanski , 2002 ) and hipparcos databases .",
    "he classified the star as a @xmath2 lyrae - type eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.806982 day and with very shallow eclipses , namely 0.1 mag .",
    "very recently , kazarovets et al .",
    "( 2006 ) designated the star hd198528 as npaqr using the criteria of _ general catalog of variable stars _ in the 78@xmath5 name - list of variable stars .",
    "van leeuwen ( 2007 ) re - examined the hipparcos data and concluded that npaqr is an eclipsing binary with a spectral type of f0v at a distance of 186@xmath027 pc .",
    "he also gives wide - band b - v and v - i color indices and interstellar reddening , e(b - v ) . due to its very limited light variations and",
    "a spectral type of f0 handler ( 1999 ) included the star in the @xmath6 doradus candidates but with doubts that it may also be classified as a @xmath7 scuti type variable .",
    "handler and shobbrook ( 2002 ) made johnson b , v and cousins i@xmath8 observations of the known and candidate @xmath6 dor stars to assess the relationship between the @xmath6 dor and @xmath7 sct stars .",
    "they found slow variations with amplitudes of several hudredths of a magnitude .",
    "taking into account a double - wave light curve they have excluded w uma - type variability and suggested a possibility of an ellipsoidal variable with a period of about 0.807 day .    in this paper , we use the optical spectra of npaqr to reveal the nature of its light variability and physical properties combining with the photometric data obtained by hipparcos and asas-3 . the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the spectroscopic observations and data analysis are described .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric results are combined and the absolute parameters of the stars are derived and the structure of npaqr is discussed in  3 . a brief conclusion is given in  4 .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been performed with the chelle spectrograph ( fresco ) at the 91-cm telescope of catania astrophysical observatory . the spectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fibre ( @xmath9@xmath10 , 100 @xmath11 m core diameter ) and is located , in a stable position , in the room below the dome level .",
    "spectra were recorded on a ccd camera equipped with a thinned back  illuminated site ccd of 1k@xmath121k pixels ( size 24@xmath1224 @xmath11 m ) .",
    "the cross - dispersed chelle configuration yields a resolution of about 22000 , as deduced from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lines of the th  ar calibration lamp .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 4300 to 6700  , split into 19 orders . in this spectral region , and in particular in the visual portion of the spectrum , there are several lines useful for the measurement of radial velocity , as well as for spectral classification of the stars .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the chelle task of iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum given by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "sixteen spectra of npaqr were collected during the 20 observing nights between august 2@xmath13 and september 23@xmath14 , 2006 .",
    "typical exposure times for the npaqr spectroscopic observations were between 2600 and 3000 s. the signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath15 ) achieved were between 70 and 115 , depending on atmospheric condition .",
    "we also observed the radial and rotational velocity standards @xmath16 lyr ( a0v ) , @xmath17 psc ( f7v ) , and 50 ser ( f0v ) with the same instrumentation .",
    "the average @xmath15 at continuum in the spectral region of interest was 150200 for the standard stars .",
    "cross - correlating the spectra of npaqr with standard stars usually yielded robust correlation peaks with a fwhm of approximately 0.18  . fitting a gaussian profile to these peaks allowed the center to be determined to an accuracy of about 0.02  .",
    "this transforms to a radial velocity accuracy of @xmath181 km s@xmath19 .",
    "double - lined spectroscopic binaries are characterized by the presence of two stellar spectra that appears in the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) as two peaks displacing back and forth according to the orbital motion of the system s components .",
    "the location of the two peaks allows the measurement of the radial velocity of each component at the phase of observation .",
    "the cross - correlation technique applied to digitized spectra is now one of the standard tools for the measurement of radial velocities in close binary systems .",
    "this helps to explore the binary mass - ratio distribution , especially in the low - mass regime .",
    ".radial velocities of the components of npaqr .",
    "the columns give the heliocentric julian date , the orbital phase , the radial velocities of the two components and third star with the corresponding errors , and the average s / n of the spectrum . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "combining the parameters in tables 2 and 3 , we derived the astrophysical parameters of the components and other properties in table 4 .",
    "luminosities are computed directly from the radii and effective temperatures of the components .",
    "while the light contribution of the secondary component to the total light of the binary is estimated from the spectra to about 0.27 , the contribution is derived from the light curve analysis as low as 0.05 . as we mentioned in the previous section neither the temperature nor the light contribution of the secondary component",
    "are estimated accurately because of the lower orbital inclination , e.g. absence of eclipses .",
    "we compared the positions of the components of npaqr in the @xmath20-@xmath21 diagram with the evolutionary tracks of girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the absolute parameters of the primary star place it very close to the evolutionary track of a 1.65 m@xmath1 single star with solar abundance .",
    "however , the secondary component appears to have lower luminosity and lower effective temperature with respect to its mass . as we noted in the section dealing with the light curve analysis the observed light variation of npaqr",
    "is produced only from the proximity effects .",
    "due to the lower orbital inclination eclipse phenomena are not produced .",
    "in addition , presence of a third component also lightens the effect originated from the proximity of close binary .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the observed light curves can not yield the accurate parameters of the binary .",
    "we do not want to make further speculation about the location of the less massive component in the hr diagram and its evolutionary status , due to the very poor estimation of its parameters .",
    "npaqr was measured by the hipparcos mission , but the published parallax is rather uncertain . in the first ( perryman et al.1997 ) and the last ( van leeuwen 2007 ) versions of the hipparcos catalogs the parallaxes are given as @xmath22=5.50@xmath01.31 and 5.39@xmath00.76 mas , respectively .",
    "the latter corresponds to a formal distance of 186@xmath027 pc .",
    "based on the bvijhk magnitudes of the binary , cleaned from the contribution of third body , interstellar extinction given by tobin , viton & sivan ( 1994 ) and the bolometric corrections given by girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we estimate a weighted distance to the spectroscopic binary npaqr to be 134@xmath07 pc .",
    "the distance to the system determined in this study has very low uncertainty when compared with that measured by hipparcos mission .",
    "the third star has characteristics of an f1 - 2 main - sequence star , similar to the primary component of the spectroscopic close binary , which would give it an absolute magnitude of about 3.2@xmath00.5 mag and a distance of about 122@xmath028 pc , if it is a single star .",
    "this result indicates that the third star would plausibly be dynamically bounded to the close binary .",
    "new spectra of the npaqr with the higher s / n ratio and resolution are needed to clarify the nature of the third star .",
    "the first spectoscopic observations of the relatively short - period close binary npaqr are presented .",
    "ccfs indicate that npaqr is a triple system .",
    "the radial velocities of both components are obtained and analyzed for the spectroscopic elements .",
    "npaqr has been observed also by the hipparcos mission and asas-3 which yielded almost complete light curves of the system .",
    "both light curves are analyzed separately and the resultant orbital elements are determined .",
    "the analysis of the light curves revealed that the light variation with an amount of about 0.1 mag is produced from the proximity effects .",
    "in other words , npaqr is a double - lined , non - eclipsing spectroscopic binary .",
    "the radii of the components and effective temperature of the secondary star could be determined with great uncertainty due to the absence of the eclipses and also presence of a third star . comparing stellar evolutionary models for the mass of the components we find that location of the primary star in the hr diagram is suitable with its mass",
    ". however , the secondary star looks like a low - mass star . while the radius of this star is as large as 1.67 times with respect to its mass , the effective temperature is unexpectedly low",
    ". the effective temperatures of the binary star s components can be determined by comparing the depths of the eclipses .",
    "since the stars of npaqr do not show eclipses due to the small orbital inclination , the eclipses do not set in .",
    "our analysis indicates that the star npaqr shows most of the characteristics of the so - called near - contact binaries .",
    "moreover , we detected a third component in the system npaqr .",
    "the third star looks like the primary component in the spectra . using this property and assuming that it is a main - sequence star we determined its distance to be 122 pc , at nearly the same distance with the spectroscopic binary .",
