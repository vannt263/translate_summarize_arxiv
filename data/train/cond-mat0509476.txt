    "it should be added that magnetic exchange through polyoxomolybdates frameworks , especially if more than one possible pathway exists for each contact , has been found to be fairly insensitive to the separation distance of the pair of spin centers .",
    "also , for similar systems based on mononuclear linker groups the bond angles have a stronger effect on the exchange energies than the contact distance.@xcite due to the presence of crystal water molecules in the solid - state structure of \\{ni@xmath0mo@xmath1}@xmath2214  h@xmath7o which space the cluster entities apart , the closest intermolecular ni@xmath42ni distance in the solid state exceeds 7.15   , rendering inter - molecular ( dipole - dipole ) magnetic exchange insignificant .",

    "these steps are found near 4.5 , 8.9 , 20.1 , and 32  t. saturation of the magnetization is not observed until 60  t. for comparison , we show the expected response of a simple heisenberg hamiltonian ( eq .

( [ e-1 - 1 ] ) and the experimental results can not be the result of heating via the magnetocaloric effect . although observed in other compounds , such an effect would only smear out the steps but not shift the step positions . in addition sample heating or cooling in a varying field",
    "is often accompanied by hysteresis , which is absent in this measurement .",
    "the observed step positions thus constitute a challenge not only to the simple heisenberg model given by , but also to more elaborate models incorporating anisotropy terms and biquadratic exchange .",

    "the figure shows the dependence of the observed epr resonance frequencies p1 ( circles ) , p2 ( triangles ) , and p3 ( squares ) on magnetic field .",
    "one immediately notices that two different slopes can be assigned to the data , one corresponding to @xmath53 and another one corresponding to forbidden transitions with @xmath54 .",
    "these dependencies can be qualitatively  and to some extent quantitatively  explained by looking at the zeeman level scheme of the simple heisenberg model ( [ e-1 - 1 ] ) as it is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] .",
    "the strongest transition which we observe in the spectra is the allowed transition p3 with @xmath53 .",
    "since the applied temperature is of the order of the coupling , this transition is actually a sum of several transitions . at low - field values",
    "it is dominated by the transition between ( @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath56 ) , whereas at higher fields the dominant contribution stems from the transition between ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the dependence of the resonance frequency of p3 on the applied field suggests that the zero - field splitting in the triplet is small .",
    "p1 is a low - field transition which connects ( @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath59 ) and thus should be forbidden . in the spectra",
    "its strength is much weaker than that of p3 .",
    "we believe that this transition appears due to mixing of @xmath60 eigenstates that would arise from anisotropic contributions to the hamiltonian .",
    "the line which is plotted through the data points suggests that the zero - field splitting between ( @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath59 ) is probably small , although , the experimental data points  which extend only down to 1.3  t  would also allow a somewhat bigger splitting , especially since the lowest - lying p1 data points appear to deviate from a straight line .",
    "p2 is another rather weak forbidden transition which shares the slope with p1 .",
    "we believe that this transition connects ( @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this transition is not observable below about 7  t due to the fact that this transition occurs only when the mixing of @xmath60 eigenstates is sufficiently strong which is the case around the level crossing at 9  t. the dependence of this transition on temperature , i.e. on the thermal occupation of the level with ( @xmath57 ) is small .",
    "the extrapolation of the field dependence allows one to deduce an approximate isotropic heisenberg coupling from the zero - field energy separation of the triplet and the pentuplet . from eq .",
    "( [ e-1 - 1 ] ) one deduces that @xmath63 , thus one obtains @xmath64  k , which is in very good agreement with the exchange constants deduced from our susceptibility measurements .",
    "the spectroscopic splitting factor can be determined from the slopes of p3 and p1 in fig .",
    "[ f-5 ] to be @xmath65 , which is also in good agreement with the value deduced from the high - temperature behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "it is noteworthy that the high field data of transition p3 have a smaller slope which , if fitted alone ( dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f-5 ] ) , suggests @xmath66 .",
    "however , we want to point out that these considerations are done on the basis of the simple heisenberg model ( [ e-1 - 1 ] ) , that does not take into account that a realistic hamiltonian has to contain anisotropic terms . a more detailed explanation is given at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec-4 ] .    summarizing this part , we find that the zero - field splitting is small .",

    "the exchange couplings , the biquadratic contributions as well as the anisotropy result from the electronic structure , and are ( complicated ) functions of orbital overlaps , lattice stiffness , and spin - orbit coupling . if the electronic structure is noticeably altered by an applied field it is probable that the parameters entering hamiltonian ( [ e-3 - 1 - 1 ] ) are also changed , but very likely in a highly non - linear manner . to the best of our knowledge , so far such dependencies were only observed in certain mn grid molecules,@xcite where the anisotropy changes sign at a level crossing .",
    "it appears plausible to us that besides continuous variations , the parameters can also change abruptly since the molecular structure may relax into new ground states at certain field values .",

    "we therefore investigate simple piecewise parameterizations of the hamiltonian .",

    "the parameters of the hamiltonian compare nicely to those of @xmath11ni@xmath2  grid molecules.@xcite the sign of the anisotropy as well as that of the biquadratic term signal the same behavior , only the absolute value of the biquadratic term is somewhat larger .",
    "the resulting zero - field splitting of the triplet is only 0.15  k , in very good agreement with our epr results .",
    "the fact that the biquadratic term is one order of magnitude larger than usually observed ( @xmath89)@xcite signals that the bonds in the basal triangle of the molecule might be rather soft .",
    "the other four susceptibility measurements , fig .",

    "these parameters differ from those for @xmath83  t in two ways : ( 1 ) the biquadratic contribution is 7  % smaller , ( 2 ) the anisotropy coefficient is three times larger .",
    "although the above parameterization describes the low - field data up to @xmath96  t reasonably well , it fails to reproduce the magnetization data at higher fields .",
    "the dramatic increase of the field spacings between adjacent magnetization steps at 4.5 , 8.9 , 20.1 , and 32  t can not be explained by small changes of the anisotropy @xmath82 or the coupling @xmath40 .",
    "the third field spacing is about twice the first one , which using relation ( [ e-1 - 2 ] ) suggests an exchange coupling that is about 1.25 of the original one . in the following we therefore investigate a model where only the exchange parameters are allowed to depend on field .",
    "this is of course a simplification since all parameters of the hamiltonian ( @xmath40 , @xmath97 , @xmath82 , and @xmath45 ) should be modified in a varying field . for our purpose",
    "we assume a hypothetical exponential dependence of @xmath40 on the absolute value of the external magnetic field @xmath98 which we motivate by a possible change of the overlap of those orbitals that are involved in the superexchange .",
    "such a change could be caused by variations of the bond distances and angles ; the latter are known to have dramatic effects on the exchange parameters . based on the magneto - structural correlations for ni - o cubanes in ref .  , a change of the exchange parameter in \\{ni@xmath0mo@xmath1 }  by the necessary amount would correspond to a change of the bond angles by approximately one quarter of a degree if the effect was attributed solely to bond angle modifications .",

    "[ f-11 ] the zeeman split levels are presented for fields up to 8  t using parametrization * 2*. the thick curves show levels for an orientation of the field axis pointing from the mid point of the basal triangle through the top ni center ( ni ion 1 in fig .  [ f-2 ] ) .",
    "the thinner curves show the levels for orientations with relative angle steps of @xmath106 along a great circle through one of the basal ni centers .",
    "the variation of the level positions with orientation for a fixed absolute value of the external field is especially large at avoided level crossings .",
    "although the final epr line is given by averaging over all orientations one can already deduce from fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] that the epr measurement is in full agreement with the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "the attached symbols for the three observed transitions match the calculated level spacings very well .",
    "to some extent one can even explain the widths of the three transitions , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f-12 ] for a frequency of @xmath107  ghz and a temperature of @xmath108  k. the transition p1 , which occurs between energy levels marked by filled circles in fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] , is rather narrow ; this is connected to the fact that variations of the field direction do not lead to strong variations of the respective levels .",
    "this also implies that the mixing of @xmath60 eigenstates is weak and thus the amplitude of this forbidden transition is small .",
    "p3 on the contrary is an allowed transition which dominates the spectrum . in the investigated field range",
    "it is given mainly by the transition between levels marked by open squares in fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] , but transitions between other ( unmarked ) levels also contribute .",
    "he rather broad line can in part be explained by the rather strong variation of the upper marked level with variations of the field direction .",
    "the transition p2 between levels marked by open triangles in fig .",
    "[ f-11 ] is stronger than p1 but also broader , which can again be understood by looking at the variation of levels .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the magnetic molecule \\{ni@xmath0mo@xmath1}. we find that the main model parameters of the hamiltonian ( i.e. exchange and anisotropy parameters ) have a strong dependence on magnetic field , an effect that may be accompanied by molecular magnetostriction .",
    "all of our efforts to avoid this conclusion lead to a blatant contradiction between theory and experiment .",
    "the discovery of a dependence of hamiltonian parameters on field in \\{ni@xmath0mo@xmath1 }  is quite novel .",
    "nevertheless , it may be a general characteristic of magnetic cluster - based materials with strong lattice coupling .",
    "it is well known that most materials ( including magnetic molecules ) are not rigid.@xcite in addition , only relatively few high - field magnetization studies have been performed to date .",
    "thus , it is of interest to discover whether other magnetic molecules might display a similarly strong dependence of the model parameters on magnetic field in the regime above 20  t.    this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grant no .",
