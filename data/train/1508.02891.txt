    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is firmly established by cosmological and astronomical observations , with its relic abundance measured by the comic microwave background being  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced hubble constant . in spite of the undoubted existence",
    ", we still do not know where to put the dm in the particle spectrum due to the lack of solid evidence from direct searches and identification of its quantum numbers .",
    "although the standard model ( sm ) is very successful in explaining most empirical observations in particle physics , one of its shortcomings is the absence of a dm candidate . to amend this ,",
    "there have been many proposals to extend the sm with a dark sector , in which the lightest member , serving as a dm , can not decay into sm particles due to some dark charge .",
    "weak - interacting massive particles ( wimp s ) has attracted much attention as candidates for the dm because it is naturally accommodated in the tev - scale physics .",
    "for example , non - singlet dm s under the @xmath5 emerge in supersymmetric ( susy ) models such as the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . on the other hand ,",
    "isospin singlet dm s commonly appear in the context of the higgs portal scenarios in which the dm s can communicate with the sm particles only via the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "a lot of work have been done based on effective field theories or on specific renormalizable models , with both approaches complementary to each other .",
    "the former has a strong power in probing the dark sector in a model - independent way .",
    "however , some phenomena such as accidental cancellations due to light particles are often improperly described within this framework , and the latter is more appropriate to address such issues .",
    "one of the unknown properties of the dm is its cp nature . in renormalizable fermionic",
    "dm higgs portal scenarios , it is possible for the dm to have both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings ( denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "explicitly , one may have @xmath8 where @xmath9 an isospin singlet scalar playing the role of messenger between the dark sector and higgs sector , and the phase of fermionic dm field @xmath10 is already rotated so that its mass is real .",
    "if @xmath10 is a singlet under the sm gauge symmetry , it will be hard to probe cp violation in the dark sector as its effect appears only at loop levels in the higgs sector .",
    "if @xmath10 participates in the electroweak interactions , on the other hand , we may detect the existence of such cp violation in electric dipole moment ( edm ) experiments .",
    "in ew - interacting dm ( ewimp ) scenarios  @xcite , the interactions between the dm and the gauge bosons are fixed by the ordinary gauge couplings , leaving the dm mass the only unknown parameter .",
    "however , the dm mass is also completely determined once the thermal relic scenario is assumed .",
    "for example , the dm mass should be around 3  tev in the wino case  @xcite . in the nonthermal relic scenario , on the other hand",
    ", the relic density could be explained by nonthermal production of the dm from heavier particles . in this case , it is conceivable that the dm mass can be as light as @xmath11 gev .    in this letter",
    ", we consider a model in which the dm resides in an su@xmath0 triplet fermion with hypercharge @xmath12 ( wino - like dm ) triplet fermions also emerge in a specific dm model that achieves gauge coupling unification  @xcite . ] and the interaction given in eq .",
    "( [ schichi ] ) .",
    "here we do not confine ourself to the thermal relic scenario and , therefore , the dm mass is taken as a free parameter . in this framework",
    ", we study the cp - violating effects coming from the dark sector on the electron edm in connection with higgs physics . throughout the analysis",
    ", the singlet scalar @xmath9 is assumed to be lighter than 1  tev .",
    "for the heavy @xmath9 case , the interaction between @xmath10 and higgs doublet ( @xmath13 ) would be described by the dimension-5 operator @xmath14 after integrating out the @xmath9 field .",

    ", there is no such a calculation with multiple higgs bosons , and thus more precise estimates are still unknown .",

    "it is noted , however , that if the suppression at the leading order is due to the proximity of the two higgs mass eigenstates , the cancellation is to all orders in strong interactions .",

    "the signal strengths of @xmath101 are universally scaled by @xmath102 , provided @xmath103 , as assumed throughout this paper .",

    "<S> we investigate an electroweak interacting dark matter ( dm ) model in which the dm is the neutral component of the su@xmath0 triplet fermion that couples to the standard model ( sm ) higgs sector via an sm singlet higgs boson . in this setup , the dm can have a cp - violating coupling to the singlet higgs boson at the renormalizable level . as long as the nonzero higgs portal coupling ( singlet - doublet higgs boson mixing ) exists , we can probe cp violation of the dm via the electric dipole moment of the electron . assuming the @xmath1 cp - violating phase in magnitude </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the relationship between the electron edm and the singlet - like higgs boson mass and coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that for moderate values of the higgs portal couplings , current experimental edm bound is not able to exclude the wide parameter space due to a cancellation mechanism at work . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the spin - independent cross section of the dm in this model . it is found that although a similar cancellation mechanism may diminish the leading - order correction , as often occurs in the ordinary higgs portal dm scenarios , the residual higher - order effects leave an @xmath2 correction in the cancellation region . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that our benchmark scenarios would be fully tested by combining all future experiments of the electron edm , dm direct detection and higgs physics . </S>"
