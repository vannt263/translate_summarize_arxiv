    "this article is divided into two parts : the first describes the intricacies and intertwined relations of different application areas of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , and the second contains an application of the discussed concepts to a particular problem in bound - state quantum electrodynamics , namely , the qed corrections of relative order @xmath2 to the hyperfine splitting of @xmath1 states in hydrogenlike ions .    the theory of quantum electrodynamics has been developed as a general theory of electromagnetic interactions of charged fermions and charged bosons with each other , via the action of the quantized electromagnetic field  @xcite . as such , qed has been developed as the first fully quantized theory involving both matter fields and gauge bosons , and among all theories that comprise the standard model , it is still the one that produces the most accurate predictions for experiments  @xcite .    the current article is a contribution to the special issue devoted to the 2010 conference on the physics of simple atomic systems ( psas 2010 ) , held at the les houches conference center in the french alps .",
    "appropriately , the second part contains a calculation of a physical effect of relevance for one of the subjects discussed at the conference , namely , the recent muonic hydrogen lamb shift experiment at paul scherrer institute villigen , switzerland  @xcite . in this experiment , the @xmath3 hyperfine component of the @xmath4 transition in muonic hydrogen is measured . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the transition frequency can be written as the sum of three contributions : the @xmath5 hyperfine structure , the @xmath6@xmath7 fine - structure splitting , and the @xmath7 hyperfine structure contribution .",
    "the current paper is concerned with the evaluation of the qed corrections of relative order @xmath8 to the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the contributions to the hyperfine splitting in this order have recently been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for @xmath9 states ) . here",
    ", we generalize the approach to @xmath10 states and observe a smooth variation of the coefficients parameterizing the qed corrections with the principal quantum number .",
    "our calculation eliminates a possible source for an explanation of the observed discrepancy of experiment and theory for muonic hydrogen and improves the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ appl ] , we contrast the traditional areas of quantum electrodynamics in the description of scattering processes and in the calculations of energy levels in atoms with more applied application - oriented areas such as highly intense laser fields whose importance has risen in recent years . in some sense , this section follows the personal route of the author whose scientific career started in a bound - state calculation  @xcite and who added other subfields over the course of the last ten years .",
    "it is a brief account of both the general principles of quantum electrodynamics to different areas , but also , of the little peculiarities that have to be analyzed in each particular case",
    ". this section might be criticized as containing `` only words '' and the author accepts this criticism as a possible point of view .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ hfs ] , we discuss a particular application of the formalism , namely , the calculation of a qed - induced shift of the hyperfine splitting of @xmath1 states in one - fermion ions .",
    "muonic hydrogen is part of this class of ions .",
    "conclusions are reserved for sec .",
    "[ conclu ] . throughout the article",
    ", we use natural units ( @xmath11 .",
    "qed is a versatile instrument for the description of processes in atoms and molecules , and also , in laser fields .",
    "the formalism of qed essentially relies on time - ordered perturbation theory  @xcite , and we may perform calculations in the theory at various levels of approximation . in general , a the term `` qed calculation '' is reserved for those electrodynamic calculations which would be impossible to carry out without at least quantizing one of the electromagnetic or fermionic fields involved in the problem .",
    "these include , e.g. , pair production processes ( at tree level ) or so - called loop calculations  @xcite , which describe the self - interactions of the quantized fields .",
    "indeed , the approximations which make a calculation possible are completely different in each particular case and must be chosen with care .",
    "for example , in a strong laser field , it makes no sense to quantize the vec potential describing the laser , and classical four - vector potentials are the predominant means for the description of the pertinent interactions .",
    "however , if an electron - positron pair is produced in the presence of a strong laser field , then it becomes necessary to apply quantum theory to the particle creation and annihilation process ( i.e. , to quantize the fermion field , see ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , for a bound electron ( in an atom ) interacting with its own radiation field ( `` self energy '' ) , it is imperative to quantize the electromagnetic field , and indeed , the quantum theory of fields has found its origin and its first confrontation with experiment in this very subfield of physics  @xcite .",
    "the `` laser - dressed relativistic furry picture '' for the description of qed processes in laser fields has been developed over the last few years  in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this picture , the time - dependent laser fields is included in the unperturbed hamiltonian that describes the fermions , via minimal coupling .",
    "formulas which enable a practical evaluation of the fully laser - dressed fermionic ( dirac - volkov ) propagator can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theory of quantum electrodynamics can be used both for the description of rather `` applied '' processes with technological relevance ( such as atoms in contact with surfaces via casimir  polder interactions  @xcite ) as well as for the clarification of questions relevant to fundamental physics , such as the highly accurate description of atomic energy levels in atoms .",
    "we can attempt to summarize the most important application areas of qed as follows :    * one of the more important and traditionally established areas  @xcite of application concerns the spectra of bound systems ( few - electron - systems , including excited states ) , as well as radiative corrections to the electron and muon @xmath0 factors  @xcite . * also of importance",
    "are the spectra of bound systems in additional fields .",
    "the bound electron @xmath0 factor  @xcite is relevant for bound and free electrons under the simultaneous influence of the binding coulomb field and an additional external magnetic field . in the calculation of the hyperfine splitting",
    ", one must take into account the coulomb field , the nuclear magnetic field and , possibly , the radiation field that describes the self - interaction of the electron .",
    "* we can also point to more practically applied subfields  @xcite : casimir interactions ( between plates , atoms , or between an ionic core and a loosely bound rydberg electron ) , and casimir  polder interactions ( i.e. , atom - wall interactions relevant to surface science and nanostructures ) .",
    "* finally , qed is indispensable for the description of laser - related processes : one uses a variant of the furry picture  @xcite , where the ( classical ) laser field is absorbed in the unperturbed hamiltonian , just as much as the ( classical ) coulomb field is absorbed into the unperturbed hamiltonian in bound - state qed  @xcite .",
    "laser - assisted bremsstrahlung , the channeling of electron - positron pairs in laser fields and other fundamental processes like two - photon emission in intense laser fields can be described in this way .",
    "missing from this list is the development of effective field theories which can sometimes leads to very useful approximations to qed , notably , in applications where fields are slowly varying on the scale of the electron zitterbewegung frequency @xmath12 . in the so - called heisenberg - euler lagrangian",
    "@xcite , the virtual fermion - antifermion pairs that lead to mutual interactions of photons ( with frequencies below @xmath13 are integrated out , and an effective interaction is written for the photons .",
    "the matching the scattering amplitudes in an effective and fully relativistic theory also is the basis for the construction of nonrelativistic qed ( nrqed ) ; the latter theory describes bound states  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the fully relativistic , initial formulation of qed for bound state is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is surprising to see how much the above mentioned areas can sometimes be intertwined : e.g , a numerically efficient code for the evaluation of bessel functions is required both for the calculation of spin - angular functions in lamb shift calculations  @xcite , but also for the numerical evaluation of the laser - dressed fermion propagator in intense laser fields  @xcite .",
    "the concurrence @xcite , which is a good measure for the entanglement of correlated photons emitted in a two - photon emission process in atoms  @xcite , can also be used for the description of entangled photons emitted in two - photon transitions among dirac ",
    "volkov states in strong laser fields  @xcite .",
    "another example : the multipole expansion is central to the expansion of the low - energy part of the bound - electron self - energy is powers of @xmath14  @xcite , where @xmath15 is the nuclear charge and @xmath16 is the fine - structure constant . in casimir - polder atom - surface interactions , the multipole expansion becomes an expansion in powers of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bohr radius and @xmath19 is the atom - wall distance  @xcite , but is still based on the same principles as in bound - state perturbation theory .",
    "there are also important and almost trivial connections between the calculation of qed corrections to atomic energy levels and qed corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor and the hyperfine splitting .",
    "e.g. , the @xmath0 factor can be related to an energy correction because it relates the energy levels in an external field to the magnitude of the applied , external , uniform field .",
    "the self - energy of a `` normal '' bound electron involves one emission and one absorption process of a virtual photon .",
    "by contrast , the additional interaction with the added external magnetic potential ( either a uniform magnetic field for the @xmath0 factor or the nuclear dipole magnetic field for the hyperfine splitting ) require us to use at least third - order perturbation theory ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] below ) , with two interactions with the quantized radiation field , and an additional interaction with the external field , the latter being described on the classical level .",
    "consequently , related calculations , which have progressed over a number of decades  @xcite follow the same principles in their initial theoretical formulation .",
    "nevertheless , a great deal of expertise is necessary in order to carry out calculations in the rather demanding subfields of qed .",
    "one example of a surprise is the fact that even in the relativistic dirac theory of atoms , one can evaluate perturbations to the fully relativistic wave function due to external magnetic fields using generalized virial relations  @xcite , whose existence would have been hard to guess given the involved structure of the dirac wave functions and of the dirac ",
    "coulomb propagator  @xcite .",
    "one underlying theme in qed calculations is the regularization of infinities .",
    "these infinities come in various different forms and are not restricted to the famous ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory which have necessitated the development of modern renormalization theory in the first place  @xcite . indeed , the different origins of the infinities also reflect the differences among the various application areas of qed .",
    "let us briefly mention three different examples for the occurrence of infinities and how to deal with them within qed .",
    "first example :  in the calculation of two - photon transitions of dirac - volkov states ( laser - assisted double bremsstrahlung  @xcite ) , we have to regularize the intermediate resonant dirac - volkov states either using their lifetime against one - photon emission ( for continuous - wave laser fields ) or using a finite laser pulse duration , calculating dirac  volkov states for given envelope functions of the laser field .",
    "the physical reason for the divergence in this case is that there is no such thing as a perfect resonance with an infinite lifetime .",
    "second example :  in the treatment of casimir - polder calculations  @xcite , we have to regularize the integrals that describe the interaction of an atom with the fluctuating electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a surface .",
    "one example is simply given by the integral @xmath20 .",
    "an infinitesimal exponential convergence factor must be introduced and leads to the regularization @xmath21 the physical reason for the occurrence and regularization of the infinity is the obvious renormalization condition for the casimir - polder interaction at infinite atom - wall distance .",
    "third example :  in lamb shift calculations  @xcite , we have to regularize and renormalize the vertex calculations which describe the interaction of the electron with the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "one possible approach is to add counterterms to the original qed lagrangian in order to ensure that the renormalized values of the mass and charge of the electron ( after adding the radiative corrections ) correspond to the physical values .",
    "the physical reason for the divergence in this case is that is a part of the vertex corrections is due to corrections to the electron charge ( or mass ) which needs to be reabsorbed into the physical properties of the electron .",
    "these ultraviolet divergences are not to be confused with the divergences in the matching parameter @xmath22 used in order to separate high- and low - energy parts in bound - state calculations  @xcite ; the latter parameter is an asymptotic matching parameter ( see chap .  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that is necessary in order to separate the regions of high - energy virtual photons ( where the energy of the virtual photon is much larger than the binding energy of the electron , and an expansion in the number of coulomb vertices is possible ) and the regime of applicability of the multipole expansion ( low - energy part ) .",
    "an illustrative example is given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary , qed gives us a very powerful formalism , which can be applied almost universally to problems in atomic and laser physics , and dynamical processes .",
    "however , the formalism needs to be adapted to each particular application at hand , and in the course of events , more often than none , yet another unexpected infinity typically appears in a qed calculation , waiting to be regularized .",
    "feynman diagrams for the qed corrections to the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen .",
    "the zigzag line denotes the exchange of a magnetic photon between muon ( @xmath23 ) and nucleus ( proton , @xmath24 ) . ]",
    "in view of the general formalism discussed in sec .  [ appl ] , it is perhaps useful to remember that the hyperfine splitting is caused by the exchange of a magnetic photon between the atomic nucleus and the orbiting particle .",
    "the binding coulomb field is taken into account to all orders , and the furry picture is used .",
    "the self energy correction to the hyperfine splitting involves third - order perturbation theory ( two interactions with the quantized electromagnetic field and one interaction with the nuclear magnetic dipole field ) , and the relevant feynman diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "recently , the self - energy correction to the hyperfine splitting of @xmath26 and @xmath1 states has been analyzed for bound hydrogenlike systems , in both a numerical as well as in an analytic approach  @xcite . within the classification of qed calculations discussed in sec .",
    "[ appl ] , the current treatment represents the case of a traditional application to fundamental processes relevant for bound - state studies .",
    "the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) hamiltonian , in the nonrelativistic approximation , can be written as    [ master ] @xmath27 \\label{hs }   \\vec{h}_s = & \\ ;   \\frac{4 \\pi}{3 m^2 } \\ , \\vec{\\sigma } \\ , \\delta^3(r ) \\ , , \\\\[2ex ] \\label{hd } \\vec{h}_d = & \\ ;   \\frac { 3 \\,\\ , \\hat{r } ( \\vec{\\sigma } \\cdot \\hat{r } ) \\ , \\ ,   - \\vec{\\sigma } } { 2 \\ , m^2 \\ , r^3 } \\ , , \\\\[2ex ] \\label{hl } \\vec{h}_l = & \\ ;   \\frac{\\vec{l}}{m^2 \\ , r^3}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , the vector of the @xmath28 pauli matrices measures the spin of the orbiting particle , @xmath29 measures the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath30 is the nuclear magnetic dipole moment .",
