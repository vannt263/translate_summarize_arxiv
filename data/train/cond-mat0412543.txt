    "we found that the local compressibility exhibits critical behavior ( a power - law decay @xmath117 ) on entering the mott - insulating regions . due to the microscopic nature of the phases ,",
    "spatial correlations appear not to contribute to the critical behavior discussed there .",
    "this is a new form of metal  mott - insulator transition not observed so far in simple periodic systems , and that might be realized in fermionic gases trapped on optical lattices .",
    "the exponent of the power - law ( @xmath72 ) was obtained to be independent of the confining potential and/or strength of the interaction , excluding , however , the unconfined case .",
    "universal behavior was also observed for the variance @xmath118 when @xmath119 . in this case , the observed behavior is shared by the unconfined model .",
    "as opposed to periodic systems , where the appearance of the gap in the insulating phase can be seen by the disappearance of the fermi surface in the momentum distribution function , we found that due to the presence of a harmonic confining potential such a feature is much less evident . in a non - interacting case",
    ", we have shown that although increasing the power of the confining potential sharpens the features connected with the fermi edge , it remains qualitatively different from the homogeneous case .",
    "hence , in fermionic systems the momentum distribution function does not seem to be the appropriate quantity to detect experimentally the formation of mott - insulating domains .",
    "finally , we determined a generic form for the phase diagram that allows to compare systems with different values of all the parameters involved in the model . it can be used to predict the phases that will be present in future experimental results .",
    "the phase diagram also reveals interesting features such as reentrant behavior in some phases when parameters are changed , and phase boundaries with linear forms .",
    "results obtained for finite values of the on - site repulsion were contrasted with the ones for infinite @xmath7 .",
    "we observe that once a mott plateau has appeared in the middle of the trap , density profiles do not change much by increasing the on - site repulsion .",
    "this is in contrast to the variance of the density , which reduces continuously to zero in the mott - insulating phase .",
