    "recently , many freeness theorems about operads and free algebras over various operads have been proved .",
    "an incomplete list includes the following results :    * free dendriform algebras are free as associative algebras ( loday and ronco  @xcite ) ; * free pre - lie algebras are free as lie algebras ( chapoton  @xcite and foissy  @xcite ) ; * free algebras with two compatible associative products are free as associative algebras ( the author s result  @xcite ) ; * the nonsymmetric operads @xmath3 and @xmath4 are free ( salvatore and tauraso  @xcite , bergeron and livernet  @xcite ) ; * the suboperad of the operad @xmath4 generated by the symmetrized pre - lie product is free ( bergeron and loday  @xcite ) .    in this article , we apply grbner bases for operads to derive several freeness theorems that imply all these results and several new ones .",
    "our freeness theorems remind of the magnus s freiheitssatz from the group theory  @xcite and its analogues in other branches of algebra .",
    "many of the results of this paper can be obtained by direct computations that use the grbner basis algorithm  @xcite , however , we tried to replace most of computations by ideas coming from the koszul duality theory  @xcite .    besides obvious applications of freeness theorems to computations of dimensions and bases for our operads",
    ", we hope that in some cases our results have further applications .",
    "in particular , results on freeness as a module are interesting from the homological algebra point of view : free modules are used to construct resolutions , so our freeness theorems may be used to ensure freeness of resolutions .",
    "we hope to address that elsewhere , together with various questions of shuffle homological algebra for non - free modules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ groebner ] , we briefly recall shuffle operads and grbner bases . in section  [ nonsym ] ,",
    "we prove a general criterion for a symmetric operad to be free as a nonsymmetric operad , and show how this criterion applies to the cases of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( first two of these were establised earlier @xcite , the last one is new ) . in section  [ suboperad ] ,",
    "we prove a criterion for a mapping of operads to be an embedding , and apply it to deduce the inclusion @xmath6 ( proved by bergeron and loday by different methods in a forthcoming paper  @xcite ) . in section  [ module ] , we prove a criterion of freeness as a module , and show how this criterion applies to the known cases @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite , and , for a certain class of quadratic operads , to the case @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the operad of ( weakly ) compatible @xmath11-structures ( generalizing our earlier result on compatible associative products  @xcite ) .",
    "the author is grateful to jean - louis loday and bruno vallette for an invitation to the conference `` operads 2009 '' where he came up with some of the ideas used in this article .",
    "he is also grateful to paolo salvatore and muriel livernet for some interesting discussions .",
    "special thanks are due to jean - louis loday for sharing an unpublished result on the symmetrized pre - lie product .",
    "all vector spaces throughout this work are defined over an arbitary field  @xmath12 of zero characteristic .    in this section ,",
    "we give , mostly following @xcite , a brief outline of definitions and the most important facts . for details on symmetric operads and koszul duality , see @xcite and @xcite . for more details on shuffle operads and grbner bases ,",
    "see @xcite .",

    "a _ symmetric operad _ is a monoid in the category of symmetric collections with the monoidal structure given by the ( symmetric ) composition .",
    "it turns out that the forgetful functor is a monoidal functor between the category of symmetric operads and the category of shuffle operads .",
    "consequently , it turns out that to study various questions of linear algebra for operads , it is sufficient to forget the full symmetric structure because the shuffle structure already captures everything .",
    "further in this section , the word `` operad '' means a shuffle operad .",
    "we use the usual way to represent operadic elements by decorated rooted trees .",
    "a tree has ( internal ) vertices , directed edges , and inputs ( leaves ) . for a tree",
    "whose leaves are labelled by an ordered set , its canonical planar representative is defined as follows . in general ,",
    "an embedding of a ( rooted ) tree in the plane is determined by an ordering of inputs for each vertex ( in terms of the planar structure , it is the ordering of inputs from the left to the right ) .",
    "thus , to define a planar embedding , we should be able to compare two inputs of every vertex  @xmath29 .",
    "to do so , we find the minimal leaves that one can reach from  @xmath29 via the corresponding inputs",
    ". the input for which the minimal leaf is smaller is considered to be less than the other one .",
    "note that this choice of a representative is essentially the same one as we already made when we identified symmetric compositions with shuffle compositions .",
    "let us introduce an explicit realisation of the free operad generated by a collection @xmath30 .",
    "the basis of this operad will be indexed by planar representative of trees with decorations of all vertices .",
    "first of all , the simplest possible tree is the degenerate tree ( without internal vertices ) ; it corresponds to the unit of our operad .",
    "the second simplest type of trees is given by corollas , that is trees with one vertex .",
    "we shall fix a basis  @xmath31 of @xmath30 and decorate the vertex of each corolla with a basis element ; for a corolla with @xmath32 inputs , the corresponding element should belong to the basis of  @xmath33 .",
    "the basis for whole free operad consists of all planar representatives of trees built from these corollas ( explicitly , one starts with this collection of corollas , defines compositions of trees in terms of grafting , and then considers all trees obtained from corollas by iterated shuffle compositions )",
    ". we shall refer to elements of this basis as _",
    "tree monomials_.    an ordering of tree monomials of @xmath34 is said to be _ admissible _ , if it is compatible with the operadic structure , that is , replacing the operations in any shuffle compositions with larger operations of the same arities increases the result of the composition .",
    "here we shall describe several admissible orderings which suit our purposes .",
    "all results of this section are valid for every admissible ordering of tree monomials .",
    "recall the following construction crucial for the `` path - lexicographic ordering ''  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath35 be a tree monomial with @xmath32 inputs .",
    "we associate to @xmath35 a sequence @xmath36 of @xmath32 words in the alphabet @xmath31 and a permutation @xmath37 as follows . for each leaf  @xmath38 of the underlying tree @xmath39 , there exists a unique path from the root to @xmath38 .",
    "the word @xmath40 is the word composed , from left to right , of the labels of the vertices of this path , starting from the root vertex .",
    "the permutation @xmath41 lists the labels of leaves of the underlying tree in the order determined by the planar structure ( from left to right ) .    to compare two tree monomials we always compare their arities first .",
    "if the arities are equal , there are several different options of how to proceed .",
    "recall that an ordering of words in the alphabet @xmath31 is said to be admissible , if it is compatible with the semigroup structure on words ( increasing factors increases the product ) .",
    "fix some admissible ordering of words : that can be the lexicographic ordering , or its reverse , or the degree - lexicographic ordering ( compare lengths first , and if they are equal , then compare lexicographically , or its reverse , or something else of the same sort ) .",
    "now , sequences of words can be compared lexicographically : first compare the first words in both sequences , if they are equal , compare the second words etc",
    ". permutations may be compared in the lexicographic order or its reverse .",
    "also , the result depends on what we compare first , the permutations or the sequences of words .",
    "this gives rise to many candidates for an ordering . generalizing  @xcite",
    ", one can prove    for each admissible ordering of words , all the orderings described above are admissible .    for a tree monomial",
    "@xmath35 with the underlying tree @xmath42 and a subtree  @xmath43 of  @xmath42 , let us define a tree monomial  @xmath44 that corresponds to  @xmath43 .",

    ". it would be interesting to describe @xmath117 combinatorially in the spirit of the description of @xmath4 via labelled rooted trees from  @xcite .    to formulate the main new result of this section",
    ", we recall the following general definitions that were given in  @xcite , as a generalisation of the notion of compatible lie brackets ( and the algebraic structure controlled by its koszul dual operad ) to general algebraic structures .",
    "let @xmath71 be a binary quadratic operad generated by binary operations @xmath123 with @xmath124 relations @xmath125 consider two operads @xmath126 and @xmath127 both isomorphic to  @xmath11 .",

    "the suboperads @xmath135 and @xmath136 of @xmath137 control a pair of @xmath11-structures which are not related in any way .",
    "now we are going to define two important ways of imposing additional compatibility relations .        1 .",
    "the operad @xmath10 is the quotient of @xmath140 modulo the ideal generated by @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and the linear compatibility relations .",
    "it is called the operad of linearly compatible @xmath11-stuctures .",
    "the operad @xmath141 is the quotient of @xmath140 modulo the ideal generated by @xmath132 , @xmath133 and the total compatibility relations .",
    "it is called the operad of totally compatible @xmath11-structures .",
    "[ o2ispbw ] let @xmath11 be an operad which has a quadratic grbner basis ( for some admissible ordering ) .",
    "furthermore , assume that all the monomials @xmath145 are normal monomials relative to that grbner basis .",
    "then there exists an admissible ordering for which the operad @xmath10 has a quadratic grbner basis as well , and @xmath10 is a free @xmath11-module .",
    "in particular , free @xmath10-algebras are free as @xmath11-algebras .",
    "let us choose an ordering of tree monomials in @xmath140 as follows . to compare two tree monomials , we first compare their arities , then the number of corollas from the set of generators  @xmath129",
    ", then compare the images of these monomials under the natural homomorphism @xmath146 ( defined on generators by @xmath147 ) , and if all the above procedures give the same result , compare these monomials using the path - lexicographic order , assuming that @xmath148 for all  @xmath149 .",
    "it is clear that this ordering is admissible .",
    "note that from our normal monomial condition it follows that for the operad @xmath150 all the operations @xmath145 are among the leading terms of the grbner basis .",
    "it follows that all underlying trees of normal tree monomials for this operad are `` combs '' : all their vertices form a chain between the root and the leaf labelled  @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider the operad @xmath151 .",
    "since this operad is isomorphic to @xmath152 , we can easily construct a monomial basis for @xmath151 from a monomial basis of  @xmath150 .",
    "let us take the set of all normal tree monomials for @xmath150 and replicate every normal monomial of arity @xmath32 exactly @xmath32 times ; for the @xmath153 replica ( @xmath154 ) , we look at the path from the root to the leaf labelled  @xmath46 , and replace the last @xmath155 vertices of this path @xmath156 by the corresponding generator @xmath157 and the remaining @xmath158 vertices by the corresponding generator  @xmath159 . as a result , the corresponding tree monomial is the least ( with respect to our ordering ) among all the monomials that can be obtained this way ( note that in @xmath151 all these monomials are equal to the least one because of the strong compatibility relations ) .    from proposition",
    "[ k - triang ] , we see that normal tree monomials for @xmath150 form a @xmath47-triangular basis .",
    "this implies that our monomial basis for @xmath151 is @xmath47-triangular as well ( the fact that all normal monomials are combs guarantees `` @xmath47 '' in `` @xmath47-triangular '' ) , so the total compatibility relations form a grbner basis .",
    "consequently , the operad @xmath10 has a grbner basis as well , as the koszul dual to  @xmath151 .",
    "finally , let us notice that for the leading terms of relations of @xmath10 which are not the relations of the first copy of @xmath135 , the roots belong to  @xmath131 ( consistent orderings of monomials for an operad and its dual are opposite to each other ) , which proves the desired result .",
    "our result , despite of the additional assumption on the operad  @xmath11 , are applicable to some new ( not covered by  @xcite ) cases , for example , the operad  @xmath88 ( its koszul dual  @xmath3 is not set - theoretic , and so strohmayer s results do not work , but our assumption applies ) .",
    "it turns out that some restrictions on the operad  @xmath11 should be imposed anyway ( both for the koszulness and for freeness of  @xmath10 as an @xmath11-module ) .",
    "indeed , let us take the nilpotent free operad  @xmath160 with one symmetric generator .",
    "for this operad , it is easy to see that @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 for  @xmath164 .",
    "thus the hilbert series  @xcite of this operad is @xmath165 , which immediately implies that this operad is not koszul ( since the inverse of  @xmath166 has negative coefficients ) .",
    "also , we immediately see that  @xmath167 is not free as a left @xmath160-module ( if it was , it would have an additional generator in arity  @xmath47 which , in turn , would lead to non - zero operations of arity  @xmath168 ) .",
    "it turns out that the result of corollary  [ o2iskoszul ] can be substantially generalized . for",
    "a binary quadratic operad @xmath71 let @xmath169 be the natural projection .",
    "let @xmath49 be a tree monomial with @xmath170 vertices from the free operad on one generator . fix an ordering of vertices of  @xmath49 , and let @xmath171 denote the induced decoration morphism from @xmath172 to @xmath34",
    "; it decorates vertices of @xmath49 with elements of @xmath173 .",
    "an operad  @xmath11 is said to be _ small _ if for every @xmath174 and every tree monomial @xmath77 with @xmath170 vertices the composite map @xmath175 is surjective ( the class of small operads was studied in  @xcite in relation to manin products for operads ; by ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) , smallness of a binary quadratic operad @xmath176 guarantees that for every binary quadratic operad  @xmath64 the hadamard product  @xmath177 and the white product  @xmath178",
    "are isomorphic ) .",
    "modelling the proof of theorem  [ o2ispbw ] , one can easily derive      in fact , in most of the cases of koszul operads , we know an admissible ordering of tree monomials for which the grbner basis is quadratic .",
    "moreover , we do not know any example of a koszul operad generated by binary operations which has no quadratic grbner basis .",
    "such examples should exist ; in the case of quadratic algebras ( that is , quadratic operads generated by unary operations ) , there are some known examples of that sort , see  @xcite .    in the last example",
    "we wish to consider , the operads are regular , so everything is essentially reduced to the level of nonsymmetric operads .",
    "the symmetric operad @xmath181 of dendriform algebras is generated by two binary operations @xmath182 and @xmath183 which satisfy the relations @xmath184 its koszul dual operad @xmath185 of diassociative algebras is generated by two binary operations @xmath186 and @xmath187 which satisfy the relations @xmath188 it is well known that the operad @xmath185 is a symmetrization of a nonsymmetric operad whose @xmath189 component has the dimension  @xmath32 .",
    "we shall see that this allows for proofs similar to those for the pair of koszul dual operads  @xmath4 and  @xmath81 .    if we introduce the new generator @xmath190 , @xmath191 , it is easy to see that this operation is an associative product . in @xcite ,",
    "loday and ronco proved that the free dendriform algebra on one generator is free as an associative algebra with respect to this product .",
    "since the dendriform operad is a symmetrization of a nonsymmetric operad , this essentially means that @xmath181 is a free left module over @xmath192 and hence the free dendriform algebra on any number of generators is free as an associative algebra .",
    "we shall prove this statement using grbner bases for nonsymmetric operads .      in terms of the generators",
    "@xmath190 and @xmath183 , the defining relations of @xmath181 are @xmath193 if we assume that the operation @xmath183 is greater than the operation  @xmath190 , and use the path - lexicographic ordering of trees , the leading terms of relations are @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "we already know that this means an upper bound @xmath32 on the dimension of the @xmath189 component of the koszul dual operad .",
    "thus , the grbner basis is quadratic since this bound is sharp .",
    "the leading terms of the relations ( except for the associativity relation ) have their roots labelled by @xmath183 which proves that @xmath181 is a free left @xmath192-module .",
