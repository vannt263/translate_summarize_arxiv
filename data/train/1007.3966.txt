    "presently , lattice calculations with dynamical light quarks are performed at lattice spacings that are too coarse to resolve the compton wave length of the @xmath0 quark , and therefore special heavy - quark techniques are required .",
    "two such techniques are the fermilab method @xcite and lattice nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
