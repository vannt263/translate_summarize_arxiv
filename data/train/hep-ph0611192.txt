    "one of the features of these models is a unified description of the present accelerating expansion and the generation of the matter and antimatter asymmetry of our universe .",

    "this is a signal in some sense of the cosmological @xmath0-violation mentioned above .",

    "we discuss the possible connection between the two phenomena above associated with the cosmological @xmath0 violation and study the possibility of testing the baryo / leptogenesis with cmb polarization .",
    "we in this paper specifically propose a class of models which give rise to enough amount of baryon number asymmetry required and predict sizable rotations of cmb photons observable in the cmb polarization measurements .",

    "( [ result ] ) and the observational limit for the baryon / photon ratio @xcite , @xmath51 , we find that a successful leptogenesis requires the coupling constant @xmath3 should to be larger than @xmath52 ( at @xmath53 ) .",

    "are expected to be in the form @xcite , [ geometry ] a^=re[(a^+b^+^2 c^+ ... )e^is/ ]  , with @xmath58 a small coefficient .",

    "the equation ( [ null ] ) indicates that photons propagate along the null geodesics , which are unaffected by the chern - simons term .",

    "this means that the polarization vector @xmath70 is not parallelly transported along the light - ray .",
    "it rotates as the photon propagates in spacetime .",
    "we consider here the spacetime described by spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric ds^2=a^2(d^2-_ijdx^idx^j )  , and the curvature scalar @xmath9 is homogeneous , i.e. , only varies with time",
    ". the null condition ( [ null ] ) is ( k^0)^2-k^ik^i=0  .",
    "we assume that photons propagate along the positive direction of x axis , i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . above equation",
    "implies @xmath73 .",
    "gauge invariance guarantees that the polarization vector of the photon has only two independent components which are orthogonal to the propagating direction .",
    "so , we are only interested in how the components of the polarization vector , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , change .",

    "@xmath80 is three dimensional total antisymmetric tensor density with @xmath81 .",

    ", a vector rotated by an angle @xmath87 in a fixed coordinates frame is equivalent to a fixed vector observed in a coordinates frame which is rotated by @xmath88 .",

    "now we consider the constraints on the parameter @xmath92 in ( [ kmu2 ] ) from the current cmb data .",
    "the cosmic microwave background can be characterized by the temperature and polarization completely in each direction on the sky .",
