    "the ma approximations allow us to understand very accurately the holstein polaron physics , throughout the parameter space , for all energies and momenta .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this powerful set of approximations to a much broader class of models with electron - phonon coupling that depends on the phonon momentum .",
    "we first derive a simple generalization , leading to what we will continue to call the ma@xmath2 , ma@xmath3 , ma@xmath4 , etc .",

    "as a test case to gauge these accuracies , we use the one - dimensional ( 1d ) breathing - mode hamiltonian , where high - accuracy numerical results have recently become available.@xcite    the general electron - phonon coupling model that we consider has the following form in momentum space : @xmath8 the first term is the kinetic energy of the electron , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are electron creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath11 is the electron dispersion . for the single electron ( polaron ) problem of interest to us , the spin of the electron is irrelevant and we suppress its index . the second term describes a branch of optical phonons of energy @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the phonon creation and annihilation operators .",

    "the second reason is that exact diagonalization ( ed ) results@xcite have recently become available for its 1d analog , relevant for cuo chains .",
    "we focus here on this 1d breathing - mode model because these results serve as an excellent gauge of the accuracy of the generalized ma approximations .",
    "their availability is very fortunate because although there are many numerical results for the holstein model , it is only due to recent advancements in computational power that more complicated electron - phonon coupling models , such as the breathing - mode hamiltonian , can be investigated numerically .",
    "we also mention that this model has been studied using the self - consistent born approximation ( scba),@xcite but scba is known to be very poor for intermediate and large coupling strengths.@xcite    in the 1d breathing - mode model , one considers a chain with two interlaced sublattices , where the cu sites which host the electron are indexed by integer labels , and the o sites which host the phonons are indexed by half - integer labels .",

    "we begin by describing the simplest ma@xmath2 version of a generalized ma approximation .      for the holstein model",
    ", the ma@xmath2 approximation amounts to replacing all of the free electron propagators in the diagrammatical expansion of the self - energy by their momentum average over the brillouin zone : @xmath63 which is equivalent to replacing all @xmath64 by @xmath65 in eq .",

    "when @xmath15 is independent of momentum .    before we discuss how to systematically improve this result , we briefly review one explanation as to why this is a reasonable first step in obtaining an accurate approximation : in real space this approximation is equivalent to replacing , in all self - energy diagrams , all free propagators @xmath76 , where @xmath28 and @xmath77 index the electron sites.@xcite if the free propagators @xmath78 are evaluated for energies well below the free electron continuum ( and for a system with interactions the polaron ground state is below the free electron continuum ) , it is well known that the free propagator decreases exponentially with increasing distance @xmath79",
    "thus , the most important terms are those with @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ precisely those included within ma@xmath2 , explaining why the approximation should be reasonably accurate at low energies ( spectral weight sum rules then insure that it is similarly accurate for all energies ) .",
    "this also suggests a means to systematically improve the ma@xmath2 approximation . since the propagators with the higher energy ( the energy closer to the free - electron continuum ) decrease exponentially with distance most slowly , the first improvement is to keep all propagators with energy @xmath81 exactly",
    "higher order systematic improvements denoted by ma@xmath82 would amount to keeping all propagators with the argument @xmath83 exactly , for all @xmath84 . in ref .",
    "we derived explicitly the holstein ma self - energy for both @xmath66 and @xmath85 .",
    "as shown and explained there , the @xmath66 order already insures the key improvement of properly predicting the polaron+one phonon continuum , which is usually absent at the @xmath86 level .",
    "the reason we went to @xmath85 for holstein is that , given the simplicity of that model , only at the ma@xmath4 level did we find a momentum - dependent self - energy .",
    "in contrast , for a model with a momentum - dependent coupling even the ma@xmath2 level gives explicit @xmath50 dependence in the self - energy [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ma0 ] ) ] , therefore in the next subsection we only consider the ma@xmath3 generalization .",
    "the main drawback of the ma@xmath2 level of approximation is that it predicts an incorrect location for the electron+phonon continuum that must start at @xmath87 .",
    "this problem is always `` cured '' at the ma@xmath3 level because in real space ma@xmath3 includes states with a phonon cloud near the electron _ and _ a single phonon arbitrarily far away , in other words precisely the type of states that give rise to the polaron+phonon continuum.@xcite mathematically , ma@xmath3 amounts to keeping all propagators with the argument @xmath81 in eq .",

    "in other words , for this model , these simplest versions of the ma approximation register that a phonon cloud is formed at a certain o site , but not whether this leads to a leftwards or rightwards displacement of that site . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", one expects clouds to be formed only on the two o sites neighboring the cu site that hosts the charge , and to point towards the charge .",
    "the effective hopping is related to the overlap of these clouds when the charge hops to a neighboring site .",

    "this explains the higher polaron mobility , hence the lower energy and slower convergence towards the exact asymptotic value for the ma approximations .    for the holstein model",
    ", this problem does not appear because the el - ph coupling is local .",
    "we argue that this problem should also become less serious if the el - ph coupling is longer range , because in that case the relative sign of various displacements is not completely lost in the @xmath127 average .",
