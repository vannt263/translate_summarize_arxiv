    "precise measurements of the top quark mass are among the most important ( standard ) tasks of the ilc project as the top quark mass affects a number of interesting observables either directly or indirectly through quantum effects . to be useful such top mass measurements have to have small uncertainties , but also need to provide information to which mass scheme the measured number refers to .",
    "both aims can be achieved from a threshold scan of the cross section @xmath9 for @xmath10 , from which one expects measurements of the threshold masses , such as the 1s mass , with uncertainties of about @xmath11  mev  @xcite .",
    "another method is based on mass reconstruction which relies on the idea that the peak of the invariant mass distribution of the top decay products is related to the top quark mass .",
    "this method can be applied at any c.m.energy and might also yield uncertainties well below @xmath12  gev  @xcite . however , until recently it was unknown for which mass scheme such measurements can be carried out with small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this is because the naive relation between the observable peak of the invariant mass distribution and the perturbative top quark propagator pole is affected by hard ( i.e. computable ) as well as soft ( i.e. non - perturbative ) qcd effects and the present mc tools do not contain the required information in a systematic form .",
    "obviously the top mass measurements at the lhc  @xcite suffer from the same problem , but the associated theoretical systematic uncertainty might be considerably larger than at the ilc .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a theoretical formalism was presented which remedies this situation , as a first step , for the linear collider framework , where one does not need to account for qcd radiation arising from the initial state . assuming a c.m.energy @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the top quark mass",
    ", one can employ the hierarchy of scales @xmath15 to establish a factorization theorem for the doubly differential top - antitop invariant mass distribution in the peak region around the top resonance : @xmath16 the invariant masses @xmath17 , @xmath18 depend on a prescription @xmath19 which associates final state momenta @xmath20 to top and antitop invariant masses , respectively . for invariant masses in the resonance region",
    "the events are characterized by energy deposits predominantly contained in two back - to - back regions with opening angles @xmath21 associated with the energetic jets or leptons from the top decay plus collinear radiation , and by additional soft radiation populating the regions between the jets , see fig .",
    "[ fig:6topjet ] .    .",
    "the plane separating the two hemispheres is perpendicular to the thrust axis and intersects the thrust axis at the interaction point .",
    "the total invariant mass inside each hemisphere is measured .",
    "our analysis applies equally well to the lepton+jets and the dilepton channels ( not shown).,width=302 ]    we assume that the prescriptions @xmath19 assign all soft radiation to either @xmath22 or @xmath23 where the probability of radiation being assigned to @xmath24 or @xmath25 increases to unity when it approaches the top or antitop direction .",
    "the result for the double differential cross - section in the peak region at all orders in @xmath26 and to leading order in the power expansion in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is given by  @xcite @xmath31    \\nonumber\\\\   & \\times & \\int\\ !",

    "the result was derived using the hierarchy of scales  ( [ scales ] ) , matching qcd onto ( soft - collinear effective theory ) scet  @xcite at the scale @xmath38 , which in turn is matched onto ( heavy quark effective theory ) hqet  @xcite at a scale @xmath39 of order @xmath14 generalized for unstable particle effects associated to the large top width @xmath40  @xcite .",

    "these hard coefficients only affect the overall normalization of the invariant mass distribution and we will therefore not talk about them here .",
    "so let us concentrate on the jet and the soft functions , which determine the shape of the distribution and the location of the resonance peak .",

    "( s-2\\delta m)^2 + \\gamma_t^2 } \\:,\\ ] ] which is the imaginary part of the heavy quark propagator supplemented by a constant width term and describing a breit - wigner distribution having a width @xmath40 .",
    "the residual mass term @xmath51 becomes relevant at higher orders and controls the mass scheme that is used .",
    "for the pole mass scheme @xmath52 to all order in @xmath26 .",
    "it is the width term ( which we can approximate as a constant since we are interested in the resonance region ) that allows us to use perturbation theory for computing the jet function . to understand the role of the wilson lines recall that the two - point function of simple heavy quark fields , evaluated off - shell , is not gauge invariant , a fact that becomes e.g.apparent from the gauge parameter dependence of the perturbative corrections .",
    "the jet functions @xmath36 , however , are gauge - invariant due to the wilson lines and well - defined _ physical _ objects .",
    "physically the wilson lines describe gluons radiated from the antitop ( moving along the four vector @xmath48 ) that are collinear to the top quark ( moving along @xmath43 ) , and it this additional radiation that renders the jet function gauge - invariant and physically meaningful . in momentum space",
    "the wilson lines lead to additional feynman diagrams having @xmath53 eikonal propagators .",
    "having defined the jet function it is now straightforward to address the question which mass scheme one might employ to have a good perturbative behavior of the jet function . at one - loop  @xcite",
    "one finds that the peak position is located at @xmath54 $ ] . recalling also that the pole mass contains a nasty @xmath55 renormalon , it therefore natural to use a mass scheme different from the pole mass that is renormalon free and absorbs at least the major part of the higher order corrections to the peak position such that the resulting series is convergent .",
    "the definition of such a scheme is obviously not unique and can also be defined from moments of the distribution  @xcite .",
    "generically we call such a mass a `` jet mass '' @xmath35 and its perturbative relation to the pole mass reads @xmath56 where the hqet power counting requires that @xmath57 in the resonance region .",
    "using this relation one can relate the jet mass to other mass schemes .",
    "the jet mass @xmath35 has already been used in the formulae shown before . from this examination",
    "we see that top mass one can measure from reconstruction is a jet mass . for sure",
    ", one can not measure the @xmath58 mass from reconstruction because it has @xmath59 and would invalidate the hqet power counting .",
    "the soft function @xmath60 describes the non - perturbative contributions of the invariant mass distribution in the resonance region .",
    "its definition depends on the details of the prescription how soft radiation is associated to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one possible prescription is using a hemisphere mass definition , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 contain everything to the left or right of the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis of each event , see fig .  [ fig:6topjet ] .",
    "it is easy to understand that such a ( and any other ) prescription is leading to a non - perturbative soft function since one can not compute perturbatively how the soft particles are distributed around the hemisphere boundary .",
    "other prescriptions are possible as long as they do not associate soft radiation going in the top direction to the antitop and vice - versa .",
    "this is in contrast to the jet functions which , according to the condition on @xmath63 and @xmath64 stated in sec .",
    "[ sectionfactheo ] are prescription - independent since they describe energetic jets within a small cone with opening angle @xmath21 around the top direction . at leading order in the power counting the allowed prescriptions",
    "do not affect these energetic jets .",
    "for the hemisphere prescription the soft function is defined by the vacuum matrix element @xmath65 where @xmath66 are color indices and the @xmath67 are wilsonlines with soft gluons of the form @xmath68 the @xmath69 and @xmath70 are operators that pick , according to the hemisphere mass prescription , the total @xmath71 and @xmath72 light - cone momentum of the gluons that are in hemisphere @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig:6topjet ] .",
    "these wilson lines describe soft radiation off the top and antitop quark and also render the soft function gauge - invariant .",
    "the factorization theorem ( [ factthm ] ) shows that the soft function needs to be convoluted with the jet functions .",
    "this can be understood physically , since the way how the soft radiation is associated to @xmath61 and @xmath62 has to affect the observed invariant mass distribution .",
    "field theoretically this convolution arises from the fact that the small components of light - cone momenta in the top and antitop jets fluctuate at the same length scales as the soft momenta described by the soft function . at this point",
    "it is also useful to note that @xmath37 is a renormalized object and that its renormalization group evolution can be computed in perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless the actual form of the soft function ( i.e. the initial condition for the soft function evolution at a low energy scale ) is not computable with perturbative methods .",
    "so in practice the soft function needs to be modeled and eventually fixed by experimental data , similar to parton - distribution functions . how a soft model function can be constructed incorporating consistently the required higher order",
    "perturbative information has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given that the soft function is nonperturbative and affects the invariant mass distribution at leading order , one might ask what one has gained from predicting the invariant mass distribution based on  ( [ factthm ] ) and concerning a precise measurement of the top mass from the mass @xmath75 where the resonance is located .",
    "the crucial aspect is that the soft function is universal and appears also in the factorization theorem for event shape distributions for jets originating from massless quarks  @xcite in the dijet region , where the thrust @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the soft @xmath77 wilson lines that arise from massless and from massive quark lines are identical .",
    "so our factorization theorem for the top invariant mass distribution in the resonance region becomes predictive after having determined a soft function from event shape distributions from @xmath78 data , which are already available from lep  @xcite .",
    "such a determination of the soft function was carried out by korchemsky and tafat in ref .",
    "using the factorization theorem it is straightforward to carry out a simple lo analysis using the tree - level result for the jet functions ( i.e. one can set @xmath52 ) and the soft model function determined by korchemsky and tafat : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a normalization factor . from fits to @xmath78 heavy jet mass and thrust lep data they obtained @xmath81 which we adopt in the following .",
    "the analysis illustrates a number of important features related to how the predictions by the factorization theorem depend on the c.m.energy q.    in fig .  [",
    "fig : plot3d]a the double differential invariant mass distribution is displayed for the input values @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84  gev .     in units of @xmath85 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84  gev .",
    "( b ) dependence of the single differential invariant mass distribution as described in the text on the c.m.energy @xmath1 with the same normalization.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   in units of @xmath85 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84  gev .",
    "( b ) dependence of the single differential invariant mass distribution as described in the text on the c.m.energy @xmath1 with the same normalization.,title=\"fig:\",width=173 ]    the conspicuous feature of the predicted distribution is that the observable resonance peak it shifted toward a higher value by about @xmath86  gev .",
    "this feature is one of the important properties of a invariant mass prescription that assigns all soft radiation to the masses . in the factorization theorem it arises from the @xmath87 factor involved in the convolution over the variables @xmath88 .",
    "intuitively it can be easily understood from the fact that the total invariant mass of a fast moving particle with mass @xmath89 plus a soft momentum increases linearly with the soft momentum and the boost factor of the massive particle .",
    "this feature is also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot3d]b where the single differential invariant mass distribution @xmath90 is plotted . here",
    "the integration interval @xmath91 $ ] is twice the size of the measured peak mean half width and centered at the peak mass . for",
    "the single differential distribution one can relate the peak location approximately to the first moment of the soft function by @xmath92}.\\ ] ] interestingly this relation can also be used for fixed @xmath87 for invariant mass prescriptions that differ in the treatment of the soft radiation and lead to different first moments of the soft function . when extrapolated to zero moment linearly",
    "one can obtain an estimate for the jet mass .",
    "we also find that the distribution gets wider with @xmath87 .",
    "this is again a consequence of the @xmath87 factor occurring in the convolution over @xmath88 in the factorization theorem since for increasing @xmath1 the jet function gets effectively smeared over a wider distribution .",
    "the shift of the peak position as well as the widening of the invariant mass distribution have been observed in simulation studies at the ilc  @xcite and the lhc for large @xmath93 events  @xcite and can now be better quantified using the factorization theorem .",
