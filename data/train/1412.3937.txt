    "the sperm of most animals swim by means of a planar flagellar stroke @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a sperm consists of a tail and a head , the latter in many cases having a larger diameter than the tail . in order to estimate the swimming speed for any given power in the framework of low reynolds number hydrodynamics",
    "@xcite it is important to take full account of hydrodynamic interactions . in the early work of gray and hancock @xcite and of lighthill",
    "@xcite the calculations were simplified by the assumption that the swimming velocity of a headless string could be used to find the corresponding thrust needed to move the head , balancing it with the drag on the head as evaluated in infinite fluid .",
    "such a calculation does not take proper account of hydrodynamic interference effects between tail and head @xcite .",
    "higdon performed an improved calculation for both planar @xcite and helical @xcite flagellar swimming which took approximate account of such effects , but he assumed a plane wave stroke .",
    "we find that the optimal stroke is rather different .",
    "in the following we study planar flagellar swimming for a bead - spring chain model with actuating forces @xcite . in order to understand the hydrodynamics of swimming",
    "it is essential to mimic the flow as accurately as possible .",
    "we are not concerned with explaining the motion of the tail in terms of its actual structure @xcite,@xcite , or with understanding the molecular basis of its mechanism @xcite .    by concentrating on the hydrodynamic aspects of the problem we are able to find the optimum mode of small amplitude swimming . in the earlier work",
    "the stroke was assumed to have plane wave character , although gray and hancock @xcite had already remarked that observations of the actual stroke show significant deviations from a plane wave .",
    "end effects are important . the numerical calculations assuming a plane wave showed maximum efficiency for a wavelength corresponding to approximately one wave over the length of the organism @xcite .",
    "the bilinear theory of swimming , as developed for a general assembly of spheres @xcite,@xcite allows the calculation of the optimum stroke of small amplitude . for any stroke one can find the corresponding actuating forces in the bead - spring model which are necessary to perform it . for a chain with a head",
    "we impose a cargo constraint , implying that the actuating force on the head vanishes , so that the force on the head is caused only by direct elastic interactions with the beads .",
    "we find that for long chains the constraint does not prevent the stroke from having near optimal swimming efficiency . for larger amplitudes we amplify the actuating forces and calculate the swimming speed and power from the limit cycle of the motion calculated from stokesian dynamics @xcite .",
    "a continuum model with bending and stretching forces and with simplified hydrodynamics and some form of resistive force theory has been studied in much of the earlier work @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the discrete bead - spring model can be conveniently used in computer simulations .",
    "gauger and stark @xcite have studied the swimming of a chain with rotne - prager hydrodynamic interactions actuated by an applied magnetic field and by induced magnetic dipole interactions .",

    "v we consider the effects of a cargo constraint .",
    "the article ends with a discussion .",
    "in the following we consider a microorganism consisting of a tail and a spherical head or cell body , swimming in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath0 . the organism is propelled through the fluid by action of the tail .",
    "we are primarily interested in a proper description of the hydrodynamics , and choose a simplified description of the tail .",
    "the latter will be modeled as a bead - spring chain consisting of @xmath1 identical spheres of radius @xmath2 linked by harmonic interactions for deviations from equally spaced equilibrium positions .",
    "the spherical head is linked to the last bead by harmonic interaction permitting elastic vibrations about its own equilibrium position .",
    "the equilibrium positions are located sequentially on the @xmath3 axis of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "we consider two limiting instances , one where the head is much larger than the beads , and one where the head is identical with a bead or equivalently , where the chain is headless . in fig .",
    "1 we show as an example a chain consisting of three beads and a head of radius @xmath4 with the beads moving in the transverse direction .",
    "we assume that the motion of the chain of @xmath5 spheres is caused by actuating forces @xmath6 satisfying the constraint @xmath7 the additional assumption that the head is passive is expressed by the cargo constraint @xmath8 .",
    "an @xmath5-chain with the cargo constraint is denoted as an @xmath9-chain .",
    "the forces on the individual spheres are a sum of actuating and elastic interaction forces . for an @xmath9-chain",
    "the force on the @xmath5th sphere is due to elastic interaction only . for longitudinal excitation",
    "we consider actuating forces in the @xmath3 direction and study the motion of the @xmath3 coordinates of the sphere centers .",
    "for transverse planar excitation we consider actuating forces in the @xmath10 direction and restrict attention to the motion of centers in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "in low reynolds number hydrodynamics the flow velocity @xmath12 and pressure @xmath13 of the fluid are assumed to satisfy the stokes equations @xmath14 the fluid moves due to a no - slip boundary condition on the surface of each sphere .",
    "the solution of the hydrodynamic problem for known forces @xmath15 exerted by the spheres on the fluid can be expressed by a mobility matrix @xmath16 relating the sphere translational velocities @xmath17 linearly to the forces . in abbreviated form",
    "the relation reads @xmath18 no torques are exerted , so that it is not necessary to consider the rotational velocities of the spheres .",
    "the mobility matrix depends on the positions of the sphere centers @xmath19 ) , but only via relative distance vectors @xmath20 due to translational invariance .",
    "the forces @xmath21 exerted on the fluid are related to the actuating forces @xmath22 by @xmath23 where the matrix @xmath24 is constant , symmetric , and with the property that the elastic force vector vanishes for a uniform shift of the equilibrium positions @xmath25 without change of relative positions .",
    "the positions @xmath26 change in time according to the equations of stokesian dynamics @xcite @xmath27 the actuating forces @xmath22 are assumed to vary harmonically in time with frequency @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the period .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) tends to a limit cycle .",
    "the mean swimming velocity @xmath30 is identical to the mean velocity of any of the spheres in the final cyclic motion .",
    "the average is over a period of the motion .",
    "we are also interested in the mean power , corresponding to the rate of dissipation in the fluid .",
    "the instantaneous rate of dissipation is @xmath31 .    in swimming the total hydrodynamic force",
    "vanishes at all times . in our case",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath32 the condition is satisfied on account of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) and newton s third law for the interaction forces . in the resistive force theory of gray and hancock @xcite and the slender body theory of lighthill @xcite,@xcite the equation",

    "the right hand side is calculated for a headless chain , and the swimming velocity is calculated from stokes law @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the radius of the big sphere .",
    "it is clear that these calculations are only approximate , and that hydrodynamic interactions are not properly accounted for .    in the calculations of gray and hancock @xcite and lighthill @xcite the stroke of the headless string",
    "is assumed to be given . in the resistive force theory",
    "the corresponding hydrodynamic forces exerted by the string are calculated from assumed longitudinal and transverse friction coefficients .",
    "lighthill @xcite has provided an improved estimate of the friction coefficients . in the slender body theory one",
    "evaluates the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the headless string from integral equations with approximate kernels .",
    "subsequently one evaluates the mean swimming velocity and mean power , assuming the equivalent of eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) and using stokes law .",
    "the assumed motion is of plane wave type , and the mean swimming velocity and mean power are evaluated as a function of wavenumber .",
    "the efficiency , i.e. the ratio of mean speed and mean power , can be optimized as a function of wavenumber .",
    "typically , for a finite string the number of waves for optimum swimming for this type of stroke is of order unity .",
    "higdon @xcite,@xcite employed improved integral equations with hydrodynamic interactions taking account of the head , but he assumed a plane wave stroke .",
    "our strategy is different .",
    "we use the bilinear theory of swimming to optimize the swimming efficiency of an @xmath5-chain with a head . from the corresponding relative displacement vector and assuming harmonic interactions we can calculate the first @xmath1 actuating forces @xmath36 . assuming the cargo constraint @xmath37 and modifying @xmath38 such that eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) is satisfied , we can calculate the swimming mode and mean swimming velocity and mean power of the @xmath9-chain .",
    "the corresponding efficiency is slightly less than the optimum efficiency of the @xmath5-chain without constraint .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that it results in a good estimate of the best set of actuating forces satisfying the cargo constraint .",
    "the same set of actuating forces , multiplied by an amplitude factor , can be used in a stokesian dynamics calculation .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and mean power can be evaluated from the numerically determined limit cycle .",
    "it may reasonably be expected that this procedure provides a good stroke for large amplitude swimming .",
    "the numerical calculations for finite chains with a head show that both for longitudinal squirming and for planar flagellar swimming the stroke is substantially different from a plane wave , in that there is a significantly larger amplitude at the tail end than near the head .    in our calculations we use approximate expressions for the mobility matrix .",
    "for a headless chain we use oseen monopole interactions for simplicity . the calculation",
    "could be improved by use of rotne - prager pair interactions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this would provide better estimates of swimming speed and power , but would make no difference in principle . for a chain with head we use the recently developed approximate mobility matrix for small spheres and a big sphere @xcite , based on oseen s exact green function for a fluid in the presence of a sphere with no - slip boundary condition @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of an appropriate set of actuating forces in more detail .",
    "we look for solutions of eq .",

    "it is of interest to study the dependence on the amplitude of the forces . in fig",
    "14 we show the reduced mean swimming velocity @xmath214 of a @xmath212-chain and a @xmath213-chain as functions of @xmath215 for the same actuating forces multiplied by @xmath66 , where @xmath216 .",

    "the bead - spring chain model of a sperm allows for detailed calculations of the hydrodynamics of swimming motion . in particular , the theory of cyclic motion in the space of relative positions of sphere centers @xcite , and the corresponding construction of an eigenvalue problem permitting optimization of small amplitude motion , provide insights into the nature of the optimal stroke within the class of planar flagellar strokes . presumably sperm in nature",

    "interestingly , the calculations show that swimming by longitudinal squirming is more efficient than planar flagellar swimming .",
    "the bilinear theory provides a good estimate of the optimal stroke .    in the calculations",
    "an approximate mobility matrix with simplified hydrodynamic interactions has been used , but it can be improved , for example by the use of a rotne - prager pair interaction between beads .",
    "the mobility matrix of a chain of spheres can in principle be calculated accurately by use of the multipole expansion method @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a bead - spring model has advantages in computer simulation .",
    "the present theory provides the type of motion for study in stokesian dynamics simulations .",
    "for example , it would be of interest to calculate the mean swimming velocity for variations of the optimal stroke calculated for simplified hydrodynamic interactions",
