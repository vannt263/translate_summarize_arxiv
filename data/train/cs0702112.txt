    "multiple - access channels and two - way channels are two of the earliest channels that were considered in the literature . the multiple - access channel capacity region was determined in @xcite .",
    "the two - way channel was initially examined by shannon , @xcite , where he found inner and outer bounds for the general two - way channel , and determined the capacity region for some special cases . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the inner bound found by shannon was not tight in general .",
    "the capacity region of the gaussian two - way channel was found by han in @xcite .",
    "a related , somewhat more general case called two - user channels was studied in @xcite . for a comprehensive review of these channels ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "a rigorous analysis of information theoretic secrecy was first given by shannon in @xcite . in this work",
    ", shannon showed that to achieve _ perfect secrecy _ in communications , which is equivalent to providing no information to an enemy cryptanalyst , the conditional probability of the _ cryptogram given a message _ must be independent of the actual transmitted message . in other words , the _ a posteriori _ probability of a message must be equivalent to its _ a priori _ probability .    in @xcite",
    ", wyner applied this concept to the discrete memoryless channel .",
    "he defined the wire - tap channel , where there is a wire - tapper who has access to a degraded version of the intended receiver s signal . using the normalized conditional entropy @xmath0 of the transmitted message given the received signal at the wire - tapper as the secrecy measure",
    ", he found the region of all possible @xmath1 pairs , and the existence of a _ secrecy capacity _ , @xmath2 , the rate up to which it is possible to limit the rate of information transmitted to the wire - tapper to arbitrarily small values .    in @xcite , it was shown that for wyner s wire - tap channel , it is possible to send several low - rate messages , each completely protected from the wire - tapper individually , and use the channel at close to capacity .",
    "however , if any of the messages are available to the wire - tapper , the secrecy of the rest may also be compromised .",
    "reference @xcite extended wyner s results in @xcite and carleial and hellman s results in @xcite to gaussian channels . the seminal work by csiszr and krner , @xcite , generalized wyner s results to  less noisy \" and  more capable \" channels .",
    "furthermore , it examined sending common information to both the receiver and the wire - tapper , while maintaining the secrecy of some private information that is communicated to the intended receiver only .",
    "reference @xcite suggested that the secrecy constraint developed by wyner needed to be strengthened , since it constrains the rate of information leaked to the wire - tapper , rather than the total information , and the information of interest might be in this small amount .",
    "it was then shown that the results of @xcite can be extended to ",
    "strong \" secrecy constraints for discrete channels , where the limit is on the total leaked information rather than just the rate , with no loss in achievable rates , @xcite .    in the past two decades ,",
    "common randomness has emerged as a valuable resource for secret key generation , @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that the existence of a ",
    "public \" feedback channel can enable the two parties to be able to generate a secret key even when the wire - tap capacity is zero .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite examined the secret key capacity and _ common randomness _",
    "capacity , for several channels .",
    "these results also benefit from @xcite to provide  strong \" secret key capacities .",
    "maurer also examined the case of active adversaries , where the wire - tapper has read / write access to the channel in @xcite @xcite .",
    "the secret key generation problem was investigated from a multi - party point of view in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "notably , csiszr and narayan considered the case of multiple terminals where a number of terminals try to distill a secret key and a subset of these terminals can act as helper terminals to the rest in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , several new models have emerged , examining secrecy for parallel channels @xcite , relay channels @xcite , and fading channels @xcite . fading and parallel channels were examined together in @xcite .",
    "broadcast and interference channels with confidential messages were considered in @xcite .",
    "references @xcite examined the multiple access channel with confidential messages where two transmitters try to keep their messages secret from each other while communicating with a common receiver . in @xcite , an achievable region",
    "was found in general , and the capacity region was found for some special cases .",
    "mimo channels were considered in @xcite .    in @xcite , we investigated multiple access channels where transmitters communicate with an intended receiver in the presence of an external wire - tapper from whom the messages must be kept confidential . in @xcite , we considered the case where the wire - tapper gets a degraded version of a gmac signal , and defined two separate secrecy measures extending wyner s measure to multi - user channels to reflect the level of trust the network may have in each node .",
    "achievable rate regions were found for different secrecy constraints , and it was shown that the secrecy sum - capacity can be achieved using gaussian inputs and stochastic encoders .",
    "in addition , tdma was shown to also achieve the secrecy sum - capacity .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the general gaussian multiple access wire - tap channel ( ggmac - wt ) and the gaussian two - way wire - tap channel ( gtw - wt ) , both of which are of interest in wireless communications as they correspond to the case where a single physical channel is utilized by multiple transmitters , such as in an ad - hoc network .",
    "we consider an external _ eavesdropper _ that receives the transmitters signals through a general gaussian multiple access channel ( ggmac ) in both system models .",
    "we utilize a suitable secrecy constraint which is the normalized conditional entropy of the transmitted secret messages given the eavesdropper s signal , corresponding to the  collective secrecy \" constraints used in @xcite .",
    "we show that satisfying this constraint implies the secrecy of the messages for all users . in both scenarios ,",
    "transmitters are assumed to have one secret and one open message to transmit .",
    "this is different from @xcite in that the secrecy rates are not constrained to be at least a fixed portion of the overall rates .",
    "we find an achievable _ secrecy rate region _",
    ", where users can communicate with arbitrarily small probability of error with the intended receiver under _ perfect secrecy _ from the eavesdropper , which corresponds to the result of @xcite for the degraded case .",
    "we note that , in accordance with the recent literature , when we use the term perfect secrecy , we are referring to  weak \" secrecy , where the _ rate _ of information leaked to the adversary is limited .",
    "as such , this can be thought of as  almost perfect secrecy \" .",
    "we also find the sum - rate maximizing power allocations for the general case , which is more interesting from a practical point of view .",
    "it is seen that as long as the users are not _ single - user decodable _ at the eavesdropper , a secrecy - rate trade off is possible between the users .",
    "next , we show that a non - transmitting user can help increase the secrecy capacity for a transmitting user by effectively  jamming \" the eavesdropper , and even enable secret communications that would not be possible in a single - user scenario .",
    "we term this new scheme _",
    "cooperative jamming_. the gtw - wt is shown to be especially useful for secret communications , as the multiple - access nature of the channel hurts the eavesdropper without affecting the communication rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transmitted messages of each user essentially help hide the other user s secret messages , and reduce the extra randomness needed in wire - tap channels to confuse the eavesdropper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : system ] describes the system model for the ggmac - wt and gtw - wt and the problem statement .",
    "section [ sec : ach ] describes the general achievable rates for the ggmac - wt and gtw - wt .",
    "sections [ sec : summax ] and [ sec : jam ] give the sum - secrecy rate maximizing power allocations , and the achievable rates with cooperative jamming . section [ sec : results ] gives our numerical results followed by our conclusions and future work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider @xmath3 users communicating in the presence of an eavesdropper who has the same capabilities .",
    "each transmitter @xmath4 has two messages , @xmath5 which is secret and @xmath6 which is open , from two sets of equally likely messages @xmath7 , @xmath8 . let @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "when @xmath388 , the secrecy capacity is seen to be zero , unless user @xmath112 has enough power to _ convert _ user 1 s re - standardized channel gain to less than 1 . for the gtw - wt , it is always optimal for user @xmath112 to jam as long as it enables user @xmath389 to transmit , as seen in figure [ fig : twwtjamp2 ] .",
    "the results show , as expected , that secrecy is achievable for both users so long as we can keep the eavesdropper from single - user decoding the transmitted codewords by treating the remaining user as noise .",
    "since the coding schemes considered here assume knowledge of eavesdropper s channel gains , applications are limited .",
    "one practical application could be securing of a physically protected area such as inside a building , when the eavesdropper is known to be outside .",
    "in such a case we can design for the worst case scenario .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fig : ggmacwtcoljam ] for the ggmac - wt , where we assume a simple path - loss model and fixed locations for two transmitters ( t ) and one receiver ( r ) at the center .",
    "we examine the transmit / jam powers for this area when the eavesdropper is known to be at @xmath390 using a fixed path - loss model for the channel gains , and plot the transmit / jam powers and the achieved secrecy sum - rates as a function of the eavesdropper location .",
    "it is readily seen that when the eavesdropper is close to the bs , the secrecy sum - rate falls to zero . also , when the eavesdropper is in the vicinity of a transmitter , that transmitter can not transmit in secrecy .",
    "however , in this case , the transmitter can jam the eavesdropper effectively , and allow the other transmitter to transmit and/or increase its secrecy rate with little jamming power .",
    "the situation for the gtw - wt is similar , and is shown in figure [ fig : gtwwtcoljam ] . in this case , jamming is more useful as compared to the ggmac - wt , and we see that it is possible to provide secrecy for a much larger area where the eavesdropper is located , as the jamming signal does not hurt the intended receiver .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the gaussian multiple access and two - way channels in the presence of an external eavesdropper who receives the transmitted signals through a multiple - access channel , and provided achievable secrecy rates .",
    "we have shown that the multiple - access nature of the channels considered can be utilized to improve the secrecy of the system .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the total extra randomness is what matters mainly concerning the eavesdropper , rather than the individual randomness in the codes .",
    "as such , it may possible for users whose single - user wire - tap capacity are zero , to communicate with non - zero secrecy rate , _ as long as it is possible to put the eavesdropper at an overall disadvantage_. this is even clearer for two - way channels , where even though the eavesdropper s channel gain may be better than a terminal s , the extra knowledge of its own codeword by that terminal enables communication in perfect secrecy as long as the eavesdropper s received signal is not strong enough to allow single - user decoding .",
    "we found achievable secrecy rate regions for the general gaussian multiple - access wire - tap channel ( ggmac - wt ) and the gaussian two - way wire - tap channel ( gtw - wt ) .",
    "we also showed that for the ggmac - wt the secrecy sum - rate is maximized when only users with  strong \" channels to the intended receiver as opposed to the eavesdropper transmit , and they do so using all their available power .",
    "for the gtw - wt , the sum - rate is maximized when both terminals transmit with maximum power as long as the eavesdropper s channel is not good enough to decode them using single - user decoding .    finally , we proposed a scheme termed _ cooperative jamming _ , where a disadvantaged user may help improve the secrecy rate by jamming the eavesdropper .",
    "we found the optimum power allocations for the transmitting and jamming users , and showed that significant rate gains may be achieved , especially when the eavesdropper has much higher snr than the receivers and normal secret communications is not possible .",
    "the gains can be significant for both the ggmac - wt and gtw - wt .",
    "this cooperative behavior is useful when the maximum secrecy sum - rate is of interest .",
    "we have also contrasted the secrecy rates of the two channels we considered , noting the benefit of the two - way channels where the fact that each receiver has perfect knowledge of its transmitted signal brings an advantage with each user effectively encrypting the communications of the other user .    in this paper , we only presented achievable secrecy rates for the ggmac - wt and gtw - wt .",
    "the secrecy capacity region for these channels are still open problems . in @xcite",
    ", we also found an upper bound for the secrecy sum - rate of the ggmac - wt and noted that the achievable secrecy sum - rate and the upper bound we found only coincide for the degraded case , so that we have the secrecy sum - capacity for the degraded gmac - wt . even though there is a gap between the achievable secrecy sum - rates and upper bounds , cooperative jamming",
    "was shown in @xcite to give a secrecy sum - rate that is close to the upper bound in general .",
    "finally , we note that the results provided are of mainly theoretical interest , since as of yet there are no currently known practical codes for multi - access wire - tap channels unlike the single - user case where in some cases practical codes have been shown to be useful for the wire - tap channel , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , accurate estimates of the eavesdropper channel parameters are required for code design for wire - tap channels where the channel model is quasi - static , as in our models considered in this paper .",
