    "motion in simple liquids at small scales is usually characterized by low reynolds numbers , in which the response of a liquid to a force applied at one point is stokes - like  decaying with distance @xmath0 as @xmath1 away from the origin of the disturbance @xcite . here",
    ", fluid inertia can be neglected , and the force is effectively felt instantaneously everywhere within the medium . in practice , this is a good approximation , for instance , in water at the colloidal scale up to micrometers on times scales larger than a microsecond . at short times or high frequencies , however , fluid inertia limits the range of stress propagation .",
    "any instantaneous disturbance must be confined to a small region for short times .",
    "if the medium is also incompressible , then this naturally gives rise to vorticity and backflow .",
    "in simple liquids , stress then propagates through the diffusive spreading of this vortex .",
    "although this basic physical picture has been known theoretically for simple liquids since the work of oseen in 1927  @xcite and has been shown in computer simulations since the 1960s  @xcite , experimental observation of these effects have been largely indirect , for instance , in the form of short - time corrections to brownian motion @xcite .",
    "direct experimental observation has only recently been possible because of the high temporal and spatial resolution required @xcite .    the finite time it takes for vorticity to propagate leads to persistence of fluid motion that manifests itself in algebraic decay of the auto - correlation function of the velocity of either a fluid element or a particle embedded in the fluid .",
    "this decay is slower than the naive expectation of exponentially - decaying correlations for a massive particle experiencing viscous drag .",
    "thus , the effect is known as the _ long time tail _ effect  @xcite , which characterizes the transition from ballistic to brownian motion of particles in simple liquids .",
    "this effect has been shown to be present even at the atomic level , _",
    "e.g. _ , from neutron scattering experiments on liquid sodium  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the inter - particle correlations and response functions of two particles can be used to directly resolve the flow pattern and dynamics of vortex propagation @xcite .",
    "this was done by measuring the correlated thermal motion of two optically trapped spherical particles using an interferometric technique  @xcite with high temporal ( up to 100  khz ) and spatial ( sub - nanometer ) resolution in both viscous and viscoelastic fluids .",
    "we were able to observe , for instance , the anti - correlation in the inter - particle fluctuations of thermal motion that is characteristic of the vortex propagation .",
    "the method is related to passive two - particle microrheology  @xcite which can be used to measure shear elastic moduli of viscoelastic materials .",
    "the inter - particle response functions @xmath2 , with real ( @xmath3 ) and imaginary ( @xmath4 ) parts defined by @xmath5 are obtained for motion parallel ( @xmath6 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath7 ) to the centerline connecting the two particles . in the passive approach",
    ", we directly measure the imaginary part of the response function from the thermal position fluctuations of the two particles via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "the real part of the response function is then obtained from a kramers - kronig integral  @xcite .    here",
    ", in order to directly measure both real ( in - phase ) and imaginary ( out - of - phase ) parts of the response function , we have developed an active method  @xcite , in which one optical trap drives oscillatory motion of one particle , while the response of a second particle is measured at separation @xmath0 .",

    "the non - linearity , however , can usually be neglected either for small distances or for low velocities  @xcite .",
