    "the origin and manifestation of such an interesting observable is not yet known clearly .",
    "it is reported that the parity doublet is not visible in a nucleus with normal / spherical deformation . however , the existence of parity doublet is possible for nuclei with highly deformed shape . in this case ,",
    "two orbitals with opposite parity lie very close to each other .",
    "since , the parity doublet is only appeared in largedeformed configuration and not in normal or spherical shape , the possibility of its origin may be related to its shape , i.e. with deformed orbitals .",
    "that means , in normal situation , the high lying partner of the doublet does not come nearer to the low lying one but when the nucleus gets deformed , gives rise a nilsson like structure in the largedeformed state .",
    "the shape co - existence , i.e. , two different shapes with very close in energy is also a rare , but known incident in nuclear structure physics @xcite . in this case , both the solutions are nearly or completely degenerate ( different configuration with same energy ) .",
