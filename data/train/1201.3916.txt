    "a variety of unusual phenomena that do not fit into the framework of fermi - liquid theory have been observed in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions .",
    "an interesting example is the emergence of new phases near to putative quantum critical points , observed in many experiments .",
    "examples include the onset of superconductivity close to the itinerant ferromagnetic quantum critical point of uge@xmath0 , @xcite an anomalous anisotropic phase around the metamagnetic quantum critical end point of sr@xmath1ru@xmath0o@xmath2 , @xcite a possible inhomogeneous magnetic state in zrzn@xmath0 , @xcite or the unusual partially ordered phase of mnsi.@xcite this has led to the speculation that the onset of new phases might represent a generic principle.@xcite    in his pioneering work , hertz @xcite studied the paramagnet - to - ferromagnet quantum phase transition of itinerant fermions that occurs by varying the exchange coupling between electron spins .",
    "he derived an effective action for dynamical fluctuations of the bosonic order parameter .",
    "later , millis @xcite used this approach to calculate temperature dependencies of the correlation length , susceptibility and specific heat . in the past decade",
    "several authors @xcite carried out diagrammatic calculations that extend beyond hertz - millis theory .",
    "they showed that the free energy contains a non - analytic dependence on the order parameter and its gradients .",
    "it was argued @xcite that non - analytic terms occur due to additional soft particle - hole modes that couple to the order parameter .",
    "these non - analytic corrections can render the transitions weakly first order at low temperatures and lead to the instability of quantum critical points to the formation of new phases .",
    "we present an alternative , analytical approach - _ quantum order - by - disorder _ - which is able to predict new phases and provides an intuitive physical picture of the problem .",
    "moreover it results in relatively simple calculations , accessible to a broad audience .",
    "it relies on the idea that certain deformations of the fermi surface enhance the phase space available for quantum fluctuations and thus self - consistently lower the free energy .",
    "this results in new phases near to the putative quantum critical point .",
    "note that in the familiar realizations,@xcite the quantum order - by - disorder mechanism is driven by bosonic order - parameter fluctuations . here , the underlying fermionic statistics of the excitations and pauli blocking of phase space is very important .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated@xcite that the formation of the enigmatic partially ordered phase of mnsi@xcite with its peculiar magnetic - ordering pattern can be explained by the fermionic quantum order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "our work builds upon the work of conduit _",
    "et al_,@xcite in which a spiral phase was predicted close to the itinerant ferromagnetic quantum critical point in three spatial dimensions . in that work , the quantum order - by - disorder approach was used with a numerical evaluation of the fluctuation corrections to the free energy in the presence of a spiral state .",
    "we develop an analytical approach that ultimately allows us to extend the framework to include new phases such as the spin nematic , a pomeranchuk - type instability in which the net magnetization is absent and the fermi - surface deformations for spin - up and spin - down electrons are of opposite sign.@xcite    this is achieved through a ginzburg - landau expansion in the vicinity of the finite temperature tricritical point .",
    "we calculate closed expression for the ginzburg - landau coefficients of a uniform ferromagnet and evaluate them analytically in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the ginzburg - landau coefficients of the spiral ferromagnet are related to the coefficients of uniform ferromagnet by averages of certain angular functions .    for the spin",
    "nematic we first develop an expansion of the generating function in powers of the field conjugate to the spin - nematic order parameter .",
    "similarly , the coefficients in this expansion are related to uniform ginzburg - landau coefficients by averages of certain angular functions .",
    "a legendre transform of the generating function recovers the expression for the free energy . by including small deviations from the isotropic free - electron dispersion",
    ", we are able to obtain phase diagrams relevant to a broader range of experimental systems .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the key ideas of quantum order - by - disorder and outline its mathematical setting . in section iii",
    "we proceed to construct the ginzburg - landau expansions for the uniform ferromagnetic , spin - spiral , and spin - nematic states .",
    "this enables us to construct a phase diagram in section iv . finally , in section",
    "v we summarize our results and suggest directions for future work .",
    "the central idea of quantum order - by - disorder is that certain phases have more low - energy quantum fluctuations associated with them .",
    "this lowers their free energy and renders them stable .",
    "the effect of the lowering of the free energy already becomes evident in second order perturbation theory ; the second order contribution to the free energy of the ground - state is always negative .",
    "the mechanism is similar in some ways to the entropic lowering of the free energy in classical systems .",
    "equivalent results for the contribution of quantum fluctuations to the free energy can be derived starting from a functional integral approach .",
    "a well known example of quantum order - by - disorder is that of a quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "if the electron spins are oriented ferromagnetically , no virtual electron hopping is allowed due to the pauli exclusion principle . on the other hand , when the spins are antiparallel ,",
    "electron hopping is allowed .",
    "this hopping lowers the free energy of the system through second order perturbation theory . in this way the antiferromagnetic phase is stabilized due to the effect of quantum fluctuations .",

    "the effects of fluctuations are already seen in self - consistent second order perturbation theory .",
    "the fluctuation corrections to the free energy are given by @xmath14 where the prime over the sum indicates momentum conservation , @xmath15 , and for brevity , we have written the fermi functions as @xmath16    note that the fluctuation corrections to the free energy are calculated self - consistently ; the energies entering the fermi functions are the mean - field dispersions in the presence of a given type of order .    from eq.([uncorrectedfreeenergy ] ) we see that the fluctuations correspond to excitations of virtual pairs of particle - hole pairs of opposite spin and equal and opposite momenta ( spin up particle - hole pairs carry momentum @xmath17 and spin down particle - hole pairs carry momentum @xmath18 ) .",
    "since we need to put in energy to create the particle - hole pairs , the denominator of ( [ uncorrectedfreeenergy ] ) is always positive , which results in _ negative _ contributions to the free energy .",
