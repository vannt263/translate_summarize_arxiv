    "when an overabundance of lithium ( a factor of 100 greater than in the sun ) was first detected in a small sample of t tauri stars , it was speculated that either the circumstellar environment of these stars furnishes fresh lithium , or that the stars are too young to have undergone appreciable lithium destruction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter argument is supported by the meteoritic lithium abundances which , at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , are also found to be several orders of magnitude greater than that of the sun at @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "bodenheimer ( 1965 ) laid out the physics for the destruction of lithium in late - type stars whereby surface lithium is carried via convection to interior regions hotter than @xmath2 k. at such high temperatures , lithium is destroyed in ( p,@xmath3 ) reactions .",
    "the idea that surface lithium abundances could be used as age indicators became widespread .",
    "the question became : exactly how and when does lithium depletion take place ?",
    "early theoretical work , such as that of bodenheimer , predicted that the surface lithium depletion would be a function of stellar mass and age .",
    "however , observations of coeval populations in young open clusters revealed that the relation would not be so simple .",
    "duncan & jones ( 1983 ) , in a study of f , g , and k - type stars in the pleiades cluster ( @xmath4 myr ) , found a spread in the lithium abundance ( as much as 1.0 dex ) for a given mass . since that time",
    ", extensive studies of open cluster stars of varying ages and masses have emerged in the literature . from studies of ic 2602 at 30 myr ( @xcite ) , ic 4665 at @xmath5 myr ( @xcite ) , the @xmath3 persei cluster at 70 myr ( @xcite ) , the pleiades at 120 myr ( @xcite ) , ngc 2516 at 150 myr ( @xcite ) , ngc 6475 at 220 myr ( @xcite ) , ngc 1039 at 250 myr ( @xcite ) , the hyades at 700 myr ( @xcite ) , the praesepe cluster at 700 myr ( @xcite ) , and the much older cluster , ngc 2682 , at @xmath6 gyr ( @xcite ) , we have consistently seen that a spread in lithium abundances at any one mass exists ( for @xmath7 ) up to the age of the hyades .",
    "we also find that the stars with the highest rotation rates are all lithium - rich .",
    "it has been speculated that rotation plays a key role in halting lithium depletion at least up until the age of ngc 1039 ( 250 myr ) . between this and the hyades age , the ultra - fast rotating stars ( loosely defined as those with @xmath8 km / s )",
    "will have spun - down into the classical main - sequence distribution ( @xcite ) , and the corresponding surface lithium abundances will have settled down into a relatively well - behaved distribution with little scatter at any given mass . unfortunately , though , current theoretical models have not successfully explained the , perhaps fortuitous , connection between rotation and lithium depletion .",
    "in fact , rotation actually seems to produce additional mixing thereby slightly enhancing the depletion rate .",
    "this problem has been well - summarized in the work of mendes , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1999 ) .",
    "ventura et al . ( 1998 ) suggest that the missing link is the stellar magnetic field , previously disregarded in theoretical models .",
    "a strong , rotationally induced , dynamo field could inhibit convective mixing .    extending the observational studies to younger populations of stars",
    " the t tauri stars ( tts )  we look for additional clues .",
    "we find that the angular momentum distribution of these stars shows a systematic difference between the mean rotation rate of the weak - lined t tauri stars ( those lacking accretion from a circumstellar disk ) and that of the classical t tauri stars which are actively accreting disk material ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weak - lined tts ( wtts ) , on average , have shorter rotational periods than the classical tts .",
    "edwards et al .",
    "( 1993 ) hypothesize that disk accretion plays an integral role in regulating the angular momentum of the classical tts as they contract towards the main sequence .",
    "the authors suggest that those tts whose accretion is halted early on the hayashi track would lack this effective brake and arrive at the zero - age main sequence as rapid rotators . since all rapid rotators ( with @xmath9 ) at the zams are lithium - rich compared to average depletion curves and since lithium depletion occurs on the pre - main sequence ( in the range @xmath10 ; martn et al .",
    "1994 ) , we look for any systematic differences in the lithium abundance patterns of wtts versus ctts .    two studies comparing the distribution of lithium abundances of classical and weak - lined t tauri stars have been presented .",
    "basri , martn , & bertout ( 1991 ) , in a study of 28 tts in the taurus - auriga star - forming complex , find no difference in the distribution of lithium abundances among classical and weak - lined tts .",
    "magazz , rebolo , & pavlenko ( 1992 ) report similar results in their study of 36 tts in the ophiucus , taurus - auriga , ngc 2264 , chamaleon , and lupus star - forming regions .",
    "interestingly , basri et al .",
    "comments that the most extreme classical tts in their sample appear to be the most lithium - rich objects . and looking more closely at the magazz et al .",
    "sample , the classical tts appear to be slightly more li - enhanced ( on average ) than the weak - lined tts .",
    "while the authors do not give significance to these results , they do point out that the classical tts , sz 24 , is extremely lithium - rich with an abundance far in excess of even the meteoritic value of the solar system .",
    "they speculate that there might be an additional process at work providing a fresh source of lithium .",
    "therefore , if there is any systematic difference between the classical and weak - lined t tauri stars , it is not evident from these studies , and , indeed , the opposite appears to be more likely .    the objective of this study is to look more carefully at the effects of the accretion process on measured lithium abundances .",
    "studies of lithium abundances among classical tts are fraught with pitfalls .",
    "in particular , the continuum veiling , produced by the accretion process , dilutes the stellar spectrum , making it difficult to reconstruct the true photospheric absorption .",
    "we attempt , in this study , to accurately measure the veiling in one classical tts : rw aur ( k4 ; @xmath11 ) .",
    "this star was chosen since it is known to undergo extreme variations in its accretion as measured by the veiling .",
    "we would expect that , if accurate veiling measurement are made and the appropriate corrections are made to the observed spectrum , then reliable lithium abundances could be derived .",
    "fourteen echelle observations of rw aur were collected at various epochs between 1986 and 1996 .",
    "each observation presents a different veiling level .",
    "though the accretion rate may be variable , we would expect to be able to recover a consistent surface lithium abundance .",
    "we do not . the apparent abundances change in an unexpected manner which we report herein .",
    "we discuss the implications this has on lithium depletion and accretion models .",
    "high resolution echelle observations of rw aur were obtained on 29 november through 1 december 1996 using the hamilton spectrograph ( @xcite ) fed by the 3-meter shane telescope of lick observatory .",
    "eighty - eight echelle orders spanning a wavelength range from 3820    to 9275    were recorded on a 2048 @xmath12 2048 thick phosphor - coated ccd .",
    "the observations were made using a 640 @xmath13 slit width ( @xmath14 projected onto the sky ) yielding @xmath15 pixel sampling ( a resolving power of 56,000 ) .",
    "an observing log is given in table  [ obs ] which includes the time at mid - exposure ( expressed as a heliocentric julian date ) , the length of the exposure ( in seconds ) , and the signal - to - noise per pixel at the blaze peak .",
    "these observations are supplemented by previously published data of rw aur which are also listed in table  [ obs ] and discussed in more detail below (  2.2 ) .",

    "the description of the rw aur observations can be found in basri & batalha ( 1990 ) and batalha et al .",

    "it is worth noting a few significant differences between these data and the more recent observations taken november 1996 . in 1994 , the imaging optics of the hamilton spectrograph were refurbished resulting in a narrower and more symmetric instrumental profile as well as a larger separation between echelle orders allowing for a more accurate determination of the scattered light surface . in addition , the older rw aur observations were recorded on a texas instruments 800 @xmath12 800 ccd resulting in a more restricted spectral coverage as well as discontinuous wavelength coverage from one echelle order to the next .",
    "the radial velocity of rw aur is determined for each independent observation of the 1996 epoch using a cross - correlation method similar to that outlined by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the spectral standard , hd 3651 ( k0 , v@xmath33 ) , is used as the template .",
    "its radial velocity is confirmed using the solar spectrum as reference .",
    "all echelle orders are used simultaneously in computing the cross - correlation function after filtering out atmospheric bands and stellar emission lines .",
    "the peaks of the cross - correlation functions define the radial velocities .",
    "radial velocities are also computed for the spectral standards observed during the 1996 epoch to confirm the accuracy of the method .",
    "both the catalog values and our determinations are listed in table  [ std ] . for all but two stars , the differences are less than 1 km s@xmath34 . both hd 206301 and hd 191026",
    "are classified as rs cvn stars , and are therefore expected to show radial velocity variations . and previously published radial velocity measurements of hd 198809 show a peak - to - peak variation of @xmath35 km s@xmath34 .",
    "radial velocities of the rw aur observations are listed in table  [ obs ] .",
    "the associated cross - correlation functions for the nov 1996 observations are plotted in figure  [ xc ] .",
    "we find peak - to - peak variations of more than 20 km s@xmath34  a result also obtained by hartmann et al .",
    "( 1986 )  suggesting the possibility of a close companion .",
    "rw aur is already known to be a multiple system with a and b separated by approximately @xmath36 and b and c separated by approximately @xmath37 . with a flux ratio in the optical of 68:1 ( @xcite )",
    ", we do not expect to find contamination from rw aur b in the spectrum of rw aur a. ghez , white , & simon ( 1997 ) have not found evidence of a closer companion brighter than k=10.6 down to @xmath38 .",
    "however , assuming a distance of 140 pc to rw aur , a resolution of @xmath38 corresponds to a separation of more than 6 au .",
    "since we see variations of more than 20 km / s over a period of just two days , we expect a closer companion to be the cause . since there is no evidence of a secondary set of lines , we proceed with the assumption that the observed spectra are not contaminated by such a companion .",
    "the projected rotational velocities are determined for the 1996 observations after spectral type determination ( see  3 ) .",
    "the spectrum of gj 380 is used as the template .",
    "the entire spectrum is artificially broadened in steps of 5 km s@xmath34 and cross - correlated with the original spectrum .",
    "the fwhm of the resulting cross - correlation functions are then measured as a function of rotational velocity .",
    "rw aur spectra are then cross - correlated with the template and the fwhm measured .",
    "this fwhm is then interpolated along the previously defined distribution thereby defining the projected rotational velocity .",
    "the entire echelle spectrum is strung together to make one vector which is used to compute the cross - correlation function .",
    "this results in a very high quality function with little noise .",
    "however , in practice , it is quite difficult to properly filter out all of the stellar emission lines , especially for those observations of rw aur at high accretion rates .",
    "emission lines produce asymmetries in the cross - correlation functions which produce systematic errors in the @xmath39 determinations .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the dispersion in the measurements listed in table  [ obs ] are due to contaminating emission lines .",
    "this is currently being investigated further .",
    "for an accurate analysis of the continuum veiling , it is necessary to deduce the spectral type of rw aur to within 2 subclasses .",
    "errors larger than this can lead to systematic veiling errors as low ( versus high ) excitation potential lines yield consistently low ( or high , depending on the spectral type in question ) results .",
    "they also work to increase the overall scatter in veiling values measured using large numbers of absorption lines with various dependences on temperature .",
    "to estimate the spectral type of rw aur , we construct a grid of spectral standards ranging from g2 to m2 ( refer to table  [ std ] ) .",
    "we select the observation of rw aur which shows , upon simple inspection , the least veiled spectrum ( hjd=2450419.73527 ) .",
    "spectral orders free of telluric lines and stellar emission lines are pre - selected .",
    "a result will be obtained for each of these echelle orders which will then be averaged together with all other results for the final solution .",
    "we expect that even this low - veiled observation of rw aur will have some excess continuum emission contaminating the underlying spectrum .",
    "we therefore proceed as follows . for each of the pre - selected echelle orders , all spectral standards",
    "are artificially veiled until the best match ( lowest @xmath40 statistic ) to the corresponding wavelength window of rw aur is obtained .",
    "the normalized @xmath40 is computed for each of these solutions and that which produces the best fit is noted . in this manner",
    ", we obtain an initial veiling estimate and a spectral type for each of the spectral orders we have selected , 59 in all .",
    "gj 908.1 provides the best match to the spectrum of rw aur , with a veiling estimate of @xmath41 .",
    "gj 908.1 is classified as k8v in the catalog of gliese & jahreiss ( 1991 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is the only star in our sample of standards that is not classified in the perkins catalog of revised mk types ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in a recent , detailed analysis of k - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , fischer ( 1998 ) computes ( via spectral synthesis techniques ) an effective temperature for this object of 4556 k  more than 400 k larger than the color temperature listed in the gliese & jahreiss catalog . this temperature ( corresponding to k4 ) is confirmed using line ratio techniques .",
    "we therefore adopt a spectral type of k4 for rw aur , consistent with the independent determination of basri & batalha ( 1990 ) .",
    "the method used herein for determining precise veiling values is loosely based on the method described by basri & batalha ( 1990 ) .",
    "a catalog of more than 1000 lines was constructed , and the veiling is computed on a line - by - line basis using gj 908.1 (  3.0 ) as the unveiled reference . after making minor adjustments to the continuum normalization ( relative to a local continuum ) , the template line is convolved with a rotational kernel to match the projected rotational velocity of the program star ( 20 km s@xmath34 ) .",
    "gaussian fits are then made to the program and template lines in question .",
    "the template gaussian is artificially veiled until a @xmath40 minimum is located defining the veiling value for that line .",
    "figure  [ veiling ] displays the resulting veiling values as a function of the rest wavelength of the line .",
    "also shown are linear fits to the distributions .",
    "there is a general trend for the veiling to increase slightly toward bluer wavelengths .",
    "however , a single veiling value for each observation is computed by taking an average of all points between 5500    and 6500  .",
    "these values are tabulated in table  [ obs ] and listed in figure  [ veiling ] .",
    "also listed are the number of lines yielding measurements for each observation .",
    "obviously , as the continuum of rw aur becomes more heavily veiled , the number of absorption lines we can detect decreases substantially ( from more than 500 down to merely 35 in this case ) and the noise becomes more significant .",
    "furthermore , the older hamilton data do not contain as broad of spectral coverage as do the newer observations .",
    "all of these factors are reflected in the dispersion ( sample standard deviation ) measurements which we use to estimate the uncertainty .",
    "veiling determinations for the older data have been previously published ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results are consistent to within the determined uncertainties .",
    "we check for any systematic line - to - line trends that may suggest the use of an inappropriate template . a difference in magnetic activity levels , for instance , may modify the t-@xmath42 relation in the tts relative to the inactive template resulting in generally shallower line profiles .",
    "lines formed closer to the temperature minimum will suffer more than those formed deeper in the photosphere yielding systematic errors in veiling ( @xcite ) .",
    "errors in effective temperature also yield systematic errors due to the fact that different lines have different dependences on temperature ( @xcite ) .    assuming that we have a large sample of lines and given the fact that we are more concerned with relative",
    "as opposed to absolute veiling values , neither of these errors should compromise the science objectives of this project .",
    "however , this is clearly not the case as we get to very large veiling values where the number of lines employed decreases significantly .",
    "furthermore , as we look at the more heavily veiled observations , we find we are restricted to the strongest of absorption lines which may further conspire to produce systematic errors .    plotting all of the data for a low veiling case , we find that the veiling tends to increase towards bluer wavelengths as we would expect if the continuum source is hotter that the stellar photosphere ( figure  [ test ] a ) .",
    "we also note a slight increase in the average excitation potential at redder wavelengths ( figure  [ test ] b ) .",
    "this casts some doubt on the wavelength dependence of the veiling distribution since our program star is undoubtedly more magnetically active than the template star .",
    "it is therefore possible that lines of low excitation potential yield systematically higher veiling values than lines of high excitation potential thereby driving the veiling distribution down towards redder wavelengths .    to check this , we quantify the veiling distribution considering only low and then only high excitation potential lines .",
    "polynomial fits to lines of @xmath43 ( 56 lines ) and @xmath44 ( 51 lines ) are computed and displayed in figure  [ test ] c. a statistically significant increase towards the blue is found in both cases while the magnitude of the veiling decreases slightly ( by @xmath45 ) for the high excitation potential sample .",
    "we conclude that the increase of the veiling distribution towards the blue does reflect the temperature of the emitting source .",
    "we also suspect that the absolute veiling value is influenced by a mis - match in the magnetic activity levels of the program star and the template , though the effect is smaller than the intrinsic ( rms ) error in the veiling measurement ( 0.4 ) .",
    "since , in this study , we are concerned with veiling variations significantly larger than 0.4 , we conclude that this effect does not compromise our results even in the extreme case that our measurements for the high veiling observations are restricted only to low excitation potential lines .",
    "this , however , does not turn out to be the case .",
    "the filled symbols in figure  [ test ] b mark the lines used in the highest veiling observation ( 17 jan 89 ) of rw aur .",
    "we find we actually use more high excitation potential lines to measure the veiling of this observation .    to quantify possible errors in effective temperature , we compute the veiling distribution for the hjd 2450419.73527 observations ( @xmath46 ) using a k2 template and then an m2 template .",
    "redward of 5500  , the k2 template gives an average veiling value of @xmath47 while the m2 yields @xmath48 .",
    "as expected , the measured veiling value increases slightly going from the k2 to k4 template reflecting the fact that most lines are getting deeper as the star gets cooler .",
    "as we look toward an even cooler star ( m2 ) , a significant number of lines become shallower once more and the average veiling value decreases accordingly . again , the errors we find arising from improper spectral classification are smaller than the intrinsic scatter of the measurements and significantly smaller than the range of variations rw aur undergoes .",
    "we select a set of photospheric absorption lines which sample a relatively wide range of excitation potentials and which are not severely blended within the rotationally broadened line width .",
    "these lines are listed in table  [ eqw ] .",
    "weak ( but significant ) subordinate lines which lie within the rotational doppler width are listed in parentheses .",
    "the line equivalent width is measured for each observation of rw aur . in order to de - veil the spectrum and",
    "recover an estimate of the true underlying photospheric line strength , we multiply each equivalent width by a factor of ( 1+v ) , where _ v _ is the veiling listed in table 1 . as shown in basri & batalha ( 1990 ) , this is the line strength one would obtain after subtracting off the excess continuum emission distribution .",
    "we make a simplification in these calculations which is to assume one average veiling value ( given in table  [ obs ] ) for all lines redward of 5500  .",
    "changes in veiling in this wavelength range are small .",

    "given the large number of lines which show no correlation , and given the statistical tests described above , we conclude that the resonance lines of ki , lii , and tii as well as the low excitation potential line of cai are indeed enhanced by the accretion process .",
    "we emphasize not only the low excitation potential but also the low ionization potential of these elements ( 4.34 - 6.11 ev ) .",
    "none of the low excitation potential lines of the higher ip elements , fei , nii , and mni ( 7.43 - 7.87 ev ) , show any indication of a correlation with veiling at our detection level . using the catalogue of solar lines ( @xcite ) and the vald database , we search for other resonance lines which could contribute to our sample , especially those of low ip elements such as tii , vi , rbi , and csi .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to identify any additional lines whose equivalent widths can be recovered at all ( or nearly all ) veiling values and whose rotationally broadened line width is not overwhelmingly blended .",
    "we measure a weak resonance line of rbi ( @xmath60  ) in the low veiling observations .",
    "although this line is of great interest due to its low ionization potential ( 4.18 ev ) , we are unable to detect measurable absorption in the highly veiled spectra .",
    "we note that the lines showing accretion - induced enhancements are resonance lines ( or low excitation potential lines ) of low ionization potential elements . with this in mind",
    ", we consider the possible mechanisms which may be at work .",
    "dark spots arising from localized concentrations of surface magnetic flux can increase the disk - integrated equivalent width of temperature sensitive lines ( those who increase in strength going from photospheric to cooler spot temperatures ) .",
    "this is the case for the resonance lines of lithium and potassium .",
    "however , the effect is predicted to be small ( e.g. @xmath61 for ki @xmath57    in a k6 photosphere with a 14% spot filling factor , and 3000k spot temperature ( @xcite ) ) compared to the large enhancements observed herein ( 300% for lithium , for example ) .",
    "observations also reveal that the disk - integrated effect of surface spots is small .",
    "less than a 15% change in line strength is observed in the lithium resonance line as the large area spots of hii 686 and hii 3163 , two ultra - fast rotating zams stars of the pleiades , rotate in and out of view ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar results are found for the rapidly rotating , weak - lined t tauri stars , p1724 ( @xcite ) and oph 052 and oph 120s ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering the typically slow rotation rates of classical tts ( and rw aur as implied by its small projected rotational velocity ) , we find it very unlikely that the line enhancements are a consequence of dark spots .",
    "we entertain the idea that the line enhancements are true elemental abundance variations , perhaps furnished by disk accretion .",
    "this is perhaps appealing for the lithium enhancements since the surface abundances may be slightly depleted through convective mixing for a star of this estimated mass ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) and age ( @xcite ) . however",
    ", this quickly proves to be unlikely .",
    "if we compute surface lithium abundances using de - veiled lines ( see  6.4 ) , we recover values ( at intermediate accretion rates ) more than an order of magnitude larger than the primordial ( meteoritic ) lithium abundance .",
    "moreover , variations occur on timescales shorter than one day",
    ". we could not explain this considering the accretion of a relatively small amount ( @xmath62 ; @xcite ) of disk gas of no more than meteoritic number densities of lithium , onto the stellar surface .",
    "finally , we are still left with the additional problem of explaining the even larger potassium enhancements , impossible to reconcile if we are correct in assuming that the disk and stellar abundances of potassium should be nearly identical .",
    "this should also be true for titanium .",
    "we consider the presence of a low temperature component to the accretion flow which could furnish a significant number of neutral species of the elements in question .",
    "the gas temperature and density should yield the strongest enhancements in potassium , followed by lithium and then titanium , with no enhancements measured in the higher ip element , manganese . in the following section , we present simple slab models which suggest that the presence of such a cool gas could explain the various enhancements we observe .",
    "we then compute line bisectors which suggest that the excess absorption indeed arises in an infalling gas .",
    "the distribution of cold gas around rw aur is approximated by an isothermal slab model characterized by temperature , density and physical depth .",
    "line and continuum opacities are computed over a range of temperatures ( 1250 to 4000 k ) and densities ( @xmath63 @xmath64 ) while holding the physical depth ( 0.1 r@xmath65 ) and surface area ( 100% of stellar surface ) constant .",
    "the objective is to determine , qualitatively , if a cold gas can yield the relative enhancements in the resonance lines of ki , lii , tii , and mni .",
    "we also include rbi @xmath60    in the analysis even though we do not have a complete set of measurements ( see  5 ) for this resonance line .",
    "it is weak ( @xmath4 m ) in the spectrum of our k4 templates but becomes pronounced in the spectra of l stars ( below 2200 k ) .",
    "the fact that we do not detect this line in the highly veiled observations is an additional constraint on the gas temperature in the slab .",
    "standard continuum opacity sources are included as a means of checking the global stellar extinction .",
    "we demand that the circumstellar gas remains optically thin in the continuum .",
    "level populations which control the line opacities are computed under the assumption of lte .",
    "the lines of the best matching spectral standard ( gj 908.1 ) are used as input to represent the photospheric contribution except in the case of lithium . for the @xmath56 resonance line ,",
    "the low veiling observation of hjd 2450419.73527 ( de - veiled ) is used as input .",
    "we proceed by computing the equivalent widths of the ( first ) veiled and ( then ) extincted line profiles for the highest veiling state we observe ( v=6.1 ) over the above - mentioned grid of slab temperatures and densities .",
    "these equivalent widths are then de - veiled in order to obtain consistency with the observed quantities plotted in figures  [ allpts ] to  [ mc ] .",
    "figure  [ slab ] shows the results . plotted",
    "are the computed line strengths as a function of hydrogen number density at a slab temperature of 2000k , valid for the highest veiling observation ( 17 jan 89 ; v=6.1 ) .",
    "horizontal lines show the observed ( de - veiled ) line strengths of each element .",
    "the hatched area corresponds to the one - sigma uncertainty levels in these observed quantities . a slab temperature of 2000 k and density of @xmath66 ( marked by vertical line ) is able to reproduce the observed line strengths . in the case of mni",
    ", we find that the slab provides no additional line extinction , consistent with our observations . in the case of rbi ,",
    "the slab does furnish a small degree of extinction .",
    "however , at this temperature and at @xmath67 , the resulting line strength is less then 200 m .",
    "lines weaker than this will not be observable at our signal - to - noise in such a highly veiled spectrum .",
    "we do not suggest that our computed slab parameters are necessarily physically meaningful .",
    "the accretion flow is not well represented by an isothermal slab of uniform density as has been shown by magnetic accretion models ( @xcite ) . however , assuming the line enhancements are produced in approximately the same region , such a simplified representation is useful and suggests that a cold component of the accretion flow can yield the relative line enhancements observed .",
    "observational constraints to magnetospheric accretion models are commonly provided by the emission line spectrum as well as the excess continuum emission . both diagnostics probe hot regions .",
    "muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann ( 1998 ) find that average temperatures of the accretion flow must reach 6000 - 10000 k in order to reproduce the hydrogen emission lines .",
    "martin ( 1996 ) computes self - consistent models of the thermal structure of gas inflowing along magnetic field lines for a star with typical ctts properties .",
    "temperatures reach peak values of 6500 - 8000 k , depending on the accretion rate .",
    "however , the initial gas temperature in the region where the magnetic field disrupts the disk ( @xmath68 , in his models ) is arbitrarily fixed at 3000 k. to date , we lack an onservational parameter to constrain this quantity .",
    "since we do not observe large velocities of the excess absorption , this is precisely the region of interest  the region we believe the line enhancements are probing .",
    "this is discussed further in  6.3 .",
    "investigating the effect of various accretion rates on the thermal structure , martin finds that inefficient heating and efficient cooling at high accretion rates result in lower average temperatures in the accretion flow .",
    "in particular , he considers accretion rates of @xmath69 , similar to that estimated for rw aur ( @xcite ) . the thermal structure , though tied to 3000 k at the disk midplane , decreases to 2000 k before rising again as it approaches the stellar surface .",
    "such low temperatures are favorable for explaining the line enhancements reported herein .",
    "we search for any telltale asymmetries in the line profiles which may indicate bulk motion in the gas giving rise to the excess absorption .",
    "for this purpose , we compute the line bisectors of the lii and ki resonance lines obtained in november 1996 ( see table  [ obs ] ) .",
    "we concentrate on this subsample of observations due to the higher precision of the wavelength calibration and radial velocity determinations .    displayed in the upper panel of figure  [ bisectors ]",
    "are the line bisectors of the lii and ki resonance lines for two low veiling observations ( hjd 2450419.73527 , hjd 2450419.84735  diamonds ) and two high veiling observations ( hjd 2450417.80447 , hjd 2450417.94248  asterisks ) .",
    "the lowest veiling observation of rw aur during the 1996 season is overplotted for reference .",
    "a completely symmetric line profile would produce a perfectly vertical line bisector .",
    "blends produce systematic deviations in the line bisectors of all observations , independent of veiling .",
    "but the high veiling observations show additional deviations towards the red .",
    "this can be seen qualitatively in the middle panels which contain the ( de - veiled ) profiles of the lowest ( solid line ; hjd 2450419.73527 ; v=0.6 ) and the highest ( dashed line ; hjd 2450417.80447 ; v=2.7 ) veiling observations of november 1996 .",
    "it is evident that much of the excess absorption generated by the accretion process is redshifted relative to line center .",
    "subtraction of the two veiling states yields redshifted residual absorption profiles ( lower panel ) with line centroids at 9.8 km s@xmath34 for lii and 19.5 km",
    "s@xmath34 for ki .",
    "this lends further support to the hypothesis that the line enhancements arise in an infalling gas and probe relatively low - velocity , low - temperature regions near the co - rotation radius .      using two high - quality , high - spectral coverage observations of rw aur ( hjd 2450417.80447,v=2.7 ; hjd 2450419.73527,v=0.6 ) , we de - veil the spectral regions containing the lithium resonance lines at 6707.7    and use the resulting profiles to compute the lte lithium abundances . we employ the spectral synthesis code , sme , described in valenti & piskunov ( 1996 ) and the line lists returned by the vald database ( @xcite ) .",
    "the code includes a marquardt non - linear least squares algorithm which allows the user to simultaneously solve for selected stellar and/or atomic parameters which minimize the @xmath70 statistic . in this manner",
    ", we obtain a lithium abundance of @xmath71 for the low veiling observation and @xmath72 for the more highly veiled observation .",
    "the lower veiling observation gives us a better estimate of the true lithium abundance on the stellar surface in light of the results presented in  5 .",
    "we find a slightly depleted lithium abundance relative to meteoritic values qualitatively in keeping with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , at a veiling of 0.6 , this is still likely to be an over - estimate .",
    "as expected , the high veiling observation of rw aur yields an abundance significantly larger than meteoritic values as has previously been found for a handful of other ctts ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the accretion - enhanced line strengths of lithium can lead to gross over - estimates in the true surface abundance .",
    "we present , in this communication , a study of high resolution echelle spectra of the classical t tauri star , rw aur , taken sporadically over a period of more than 10 years .",
    "the continuum veiling distribution is determined in the optical by comparing hundreds of stellar absorption lines of a well - matching spectral template star with those of the program star . errors ( both random and systematic ) in the resulting veiling values are investigated .",
    "we find that systematic errors arising from improper spectral classification are less than the actual line - to - line dispersion in the veiling values and significantly smaller than the magnitude of the veiling variations which rw aur undergoes .    in the process of investigating lii @xmath73    as a potential veiling diagnostic ( useful in cases of extremely high continuum veiling which works to wash away all but the strongest absorption lines )",
    ", we find that this particular absorption line is , in fact , enhanced by the accretion process . its line strength ( after applying corrections for the effect of continuum veiling ) more than doubles between the observation of lowest measured accretion and that of the highest measured accretion .",
    "searching for similar behavior among other resonance lines of low ip elements , we find that ki ( @xmath74  ) and tii ( @xmath75  ) are also enhanced by the accretion process , thereby eliminating the possibility that lithium undergoes true abundance variations as the disk supplies fresh lithium which convective mixing then works to deplete .",
    "we conclude that the observed line enhancements are significant , and not merely a consequence of errors in veiling determinations , after finding no such enhancements in a large sample of absorption lines of different excitational potentials and of various ip elements .",
    "approximately 83% of the 29 lines studied show no correlation at all between their line strength and the respective continuum veiling .",
    "we find that the resonance line of the lowest ip element observed , ki ( 4.34 ev ) , presents the most sensitive correlation between veiling and line strength , followed by that of lii ( 5.39 ev ) and then tii ( 6.82 ev ) .",
    "the resonance line of mni ( 7.43 ev ) shows no similar behavior . finding it unlikely that cool magnetic surface spots are responsible for the observed enhancements , we investigate the possibility of an additional source of line opacity arising in a cool gas in the accretion flow .",
    "simple slab models are generated which successfully reproduce the relative line enhancements observed among the 4 resonance lines of ki , lii , tii , and mni at a temperature of 2000 k and density of @xmath76 .",
    "models assume a projected thickness of @xmath77 and a filling factor of 100% ( that is , the entire stellar surface is assumed to be extincted by the accreting gas ) .",
    "while providing line extinction , the slab does not introduce significant continuum opacity .",
    "line bisectors of the ki line profiles are computed , and comparison of those of the low veiling observations with those of the high veiling observations reveal that the excess absorption is preferentially redshifted relative to the stellar rest - frame .",
    "the bisectors of the low and high veiling states differ by merely 10 km s@xmath34 for lii and 20 km s@xmath34 for ki .",
    "centroids of the residual absorption yield the same results .",
    "this leads us to speculate that the line enhancements are indeed generated in an infalling gas located at the beginning of the accretion flow near the co - rotation radius .    as an exercise ,",
    "the surface lithium abundances are computed using veiling - corrected @xmath73    line profiles and ignoring the accretion - induced enhancements .",
    "we find that , as a consequence , surface lithium abundances can be grossly over - estimated . at a veiling of 0.6",
    ", we compute an lte abundance of @xmath78 , while at a veiling of 2.7 , we compute an abundance of @xmath79 .",
    "we hypothesize that the large abundances ( often in excess of meteoritic values ) reported for the highly accreting tts suffer from such systematic errors .",
    "we conclude that the resonance lines of lii , ki , and tii are unreliable lines for measuring continuum veiling in classical tts . however , they may act as an additional probe of the circumstellar environment which has traditionally been left to the emission line spectrum .",
    "we propose that a cool component to the accretion column could explain the observed line enhancements of the low ip resonance lines studied herein .",
    "we also conclude that surface lithium abundance measurements of classical tts are subject to gross systematic errors .",
    "such errors can be minimized by studying systems , such as rw aur , which present largely varying accretion rates . in its low accretion state",
