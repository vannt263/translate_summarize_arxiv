    "the general result of these investigations is the existence of first - order transition between various commensurate and incommensurate magnetic states which invokes a phase separation ( first discussed by visscher  @xcite ) .    to describe the properties of such systems one uses many - electron models like the hubbard , @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange ( kondo ) model and anderson lattice model .",
