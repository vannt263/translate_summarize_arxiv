    "detached eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) provide one of the most precise ( @xmath11 per cent ) and accurate ( largely model and distance independent ) methods for measurement of fundamental stellar properties ( particularly , masses and radii ) . these can be used to place stringent constraints on stellar evolution models .    on the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) ,",
    "such constraints are presently extremely scarce below @xmath12 , and to our knowledge there are only @xmath13 known pms eb systems in this mass range .",
    "these are a @xmath14 , @xmath15 eb @xcite and a @xmath16 , @xmath17 eb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , both in orion ( the former is thought to belong to the ori 1c association ) , with corresponding age @xmath18 , an m - dwarf eb in ngc 1647 ( @xmath19 ; @xcite ) , and two ebs in the onc : a brown dwarf - brown dwarf system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and a @xmath20 , @xmath21 m - dwarf eb ( cargile , stassun & mathieu , submitted ) .",
    "comparison of the ngc 1647 and onc brown dwarf systems to a variety of stellar models ( specifically : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for the former , and @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for the latter ) by the respective authors has indicated that none fit both components of the binaries simultaneously . in the case of the brown dwarf eb , the models do seem to be reasonably consistent with both objects , but the secondary appears to be hotter than the primary , a very surprising result that was not predicted by any of the models .",
    "the study of low - mass stars poses a challenge for stellar models .",
    "stars near to the hydrogen burning limit are sufficiently cool that the interior is in a partially - degenerate state on the main sequence @xcite , and magnetic fields may play an important role @xcite .",
    "the approximations underlying the usual ` grey ' atmosphere models break down , so non - grey model atmospheres must be determined , taking account of effects such as the recombination of molecules ( e.g. h@xmath22 and tio ) due to the low temperatures @xcite .",
    "one of the only ways to test these models is by comparison with precise observations of low - mass stars .",
    "it is therefore essential that a larger sample of pre - main sequence systems be found and characterised , to provide better constraints on the models .",
    "this is the primary aim of the monitor project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a photometric monitoring survey we have undertaken of all suitable nearby , pre - main sequence open clusters and star forming regions , to search for detached eclipsing binary and transiting planet systems .",
    "this publication presents the first of these , a detached eb in the orion nebula cluster , which has age @xmath23 and distance @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "sections [ phot_section ] and [ spec_section ] review the photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis , respectively .",
    "section [ lcanal_section ] presents the light curve analysis and system parameters , and in section [ modelcomp_section ] these are compared with the predictions of stellar models .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in  [ concl_section ] .",
    "eclipses in jw 380 were initially detected in our photometric monitoring data of the onc obtained using the @xmath25 isaac newton telescope ( int ) , with the wide field camera ( wfc ) , during two @xmath26-night observing runs , one in late - november 2004 , and one in january 2005 .",
    "this was supplemented by two further @xmath26-night runs in december 2005 and 2006 .",
    "a single @xmath27 field centred on the trapezium region ( @xmath28 ori ) was observed for the entire time it was at airmass @xmath29 , @xmath30 per night , using alternating @xmath31 @xmath4-band and @xmath32 @xmath5-band exposures . due to the fast ( @xmath33 ) readout of the wfc this gave a cadence of @xmath34 .",
    "a total of @xmath35 exposures were obtained in each passband , for a total time on target of @xmath36 .",
    "our observations are sufficient to give an rms per data point of @xmath37 or better down to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "light curves were extracted for a total of @xmath40 objects using our differential photometry software @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-band light curves in particular are somewhat affected by the presence of nebulosity in the onc region , and show significantly more scatter than the @xmath5-band data .",
    "we therefore used the latter for detection of eclipsing binary systems , and the @xmath4-band observations for confirmation .    due to the extensive intrinsic stellar variability seen in onc stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the search for eclipsing systems was by necessity performed manually",
    "the first candidate detected in this way is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the @xmath5-band light curve ( see the upper panel of fig . [ 290_lc ] ) shows @xmath41 eclipse events , with @xmath42 peak - to - peak out of eclipse variations .",
    "the object appears in the catalogue of @xcite as star @xmath43 , with membership probability @xmath44 derived from proper motion measurements by these authors .",
    "it was also detected by the chandra orion ultradeep project ( coup ; @xcite , star 468 ) , and in the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , as source 2mass j05351214 - 0531388 .",
    "the photometric properties of the object are summarised in table [ 290_phot ] .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath45 magnitudes were derived from the monitor photometry using colour equations from the int wide field survey web pages , and the near - ir @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 magnitudes from the 2mass photometry using colour equations in the 2mass explanatory supplement .",
    "spitzer / irac measurements are from table 1 of @xcite .",
    ".photometric properties of the eclipsing binary system .",
    "errors are not quoted for the int / wfc photometry because these are dominated by systematic errors from the sky subtraction due to the extensive nebulosity in the optical .",
    "we expect that these are @xmath49 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we caution that the effects of the out - of - eclipse modulations are non - negligible in this system , and these have not been modelled at present due to the lack of suitable light curve data .",
    "therefore , the parameters derived from the light curve fitting may be affected by systematic errors due to not properly accounting for the spot - induced photometric variations .",
    "improved light curves will be required to resolve this problem .",
    "we are unable to determine accurate effective temperatures at the present time , so the only comparison which can be made to stellar models with the present data - set is in the mass - radius plane .",
    "figure [ mrrel ] shows a comparison of the observations for the present system with the lyon group stellar models .",
    "the primary and secondary are consistent within the @xmath7 error bars with the @xmath50 model of @xcite , but @xmath51 away from the @xmath52 model . the primary is also consistent within @xmath53 with the @xmath54 model .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is fully consistent with the upper end of the canonical @xmath56 age for the onc @xcite .",
    ", solid lines ; @xcite ) and dusty ( dashed lines ; @xcite ) models from the lyon group , at five ages ( top to bottom ) : @xmath52 ( grey line ) , @xmath55 ( blue ) , @xmath57 ( red ) , @xmath58 ( magenta ) and @xmath59 ( black ) .",
    "systems shown as red points with error bars are existing pre - main sequence binaries from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the small grey points with error bars are a compilation of field systems from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . we have opted to show results from the literature to produce a figure summarising the present empirical constraints on the pms mass - radius relation . the dusty models are included to show the predicted behaviour in the brown dwarf domain.,width=307 ]        figure [ modelcomp ] shows the position of the eclipsing binary relative to models from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results for the @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are consistent with the @xmath55 inferred age from above ; although there are clearly visible differences between the results of these sets of tracks ( especially when comparing @xcite to the others ) , the measurement errors are too large to distinguish them at present . comparing the data with the models of @xcite would indicate a slightly older age of @xmath60 .",
    "however , there is a visible discontinuity in the latter tracks at @xmath55 , and they are not well - sampled over this mass range .    given the present observational errors , it is not yet meaningful to perform a more detailed comparison with stellar models .",
    "we plan to obtain improved photometry and radial velocity measurements to resolve this , in addition to spectroscopy covering suitable lines for determining effective temperatures and flux ratios .",
    "we have reported the detection of a new pre - main - sequence eclipsing binary , jw 380 , which appears to be a member of the orion nebula cluster ( membership probability @xmath44 , systemic velocity within @xmath53 of the cluster systemic velocity ) .",
    "the system consists of a @xmath0 , @xmath61 eclipsing binary with period @xmath62 , blended with a significant ( @xmath63 per cent of the total luminosity ) third light component , which appears to show no significant radial velocity variations over the ( limited ) observing window .",
    "modelling the combined light and radial velocity curves for the system yielded stellar radii of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the primary and secondary of the binary system .",
    "these large radii are consistent with the @xmath64 age stellar models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the @xmath54 age models of @xcite given the masses of the system components .",
    "the systemic radial velocity is consistent with that of the onc , and the detection of a clear lii @xmath65 absorption feature is also suggestive of youth , and hence onc membership .",
