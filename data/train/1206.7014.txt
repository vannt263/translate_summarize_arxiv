    "the copolymer is modeled as a bead - spring chain consisting of @xmath11 beads linearly connected by @xmath12 springs .",
    "the copolymer comprises of two types of monomers ( or beads ) , they are either hydrophobic or hydrophilic . as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] , we consider three different arrangements of hydrophobic beads along the polymer chain .",
    "the hydrophobic beads are distributed either in a random , periodic or block copolymer arrangements .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] represents the three different distributions for a chain with a fraction , @xmath13 , of hydrophobic groups .    each bead in the polymer chain represents a brownian particle , and its dynamics is described by the langevin equation ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the mass , position and velocity of particle @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the random force , @xmath18 , arising from the bombardment of the monomer bead by the solvent molecules is described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 the absolute temperature , and @xmath22 is the frictional drag .",
    "externally applied , equal and opposite forces , @xmath23 , act on the terminal beads of the chain .",
    "however , @xmath24 for the remaining polymer beads .",
    "equation  [ eq : langevin ] was solved numerically using the velocity - verlet algorithm , with a time step @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",

    "we use @xmath31 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 as scales for energy , length , and mass , respectively .",
    "the bond length , @xmath34 , and the mass of a polymer bead , @xmath36 are set to a value of one .",

    "the simulations were carried out in the open - source molecular dynamics simulation package lammps  @xcite .",
    "we used chain sizes of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in our simulations .",
    "the polymer chain is enclosed inside a cubic box of edge length , @xmath57 , ( for instance , @xmath58 @xmath35 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath35 for @xmath61 ) with periodic boundary conditions imposed in all three directions . in order to model the appropriate effective solvent interactions",
    ", we set @xmath62 for the hydrophobic beads and @xmath63 for the hydrophilic ones .",
    "for a homopolymer , a choice of @xmath63 for all beads simulates a polymer chain that demonstrates self - avoiding walk statistics , whereas a value of @xmath62 results in a collapsed globule ( results not shown here ) .",
    "when @xmath64 , we recover gaussian statistics for the homopolymer .",
    "we varied the hydrophobic bead fraction , @xmath2 , between @xmath44 and @xmath65 , to explore the effects of disorder on the force - extension response of the polymer chain .",
    "the initial configuration of the chain was such that a fraction , @xmath2 , of the beads were assigned as hydrophobic and the rest , @xmath66 , were considered to be hydrophilic .",
    "initially , the polymer chain is equilibrated in solution for a period of @xmath67 time steps ( depending on the chain size ) in the absence of any external force ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the equilibration time chosen for a given chain length is such that it is several times larger than the corresponding rouse relaxation time , thus ensuring that the chain has indeed equilibrated before the ensuing pulling cycle .",
    "the chain was then stretched from the equilibrium state to full extension by an incremental increase in pulling force , @xmath69 , from a value of @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "the pulling cycle is followed by a retraction cycle where @xmath69 is decreased from @xmath71 to @xmath70 . during the pulling and the retraction cycles ,",
    "the polymer is equilibrated for a period of @xmath72 time steps ( again depending on the chain size ) at a given value of @xmath69 .",
    "we calculate the time - averaged value of the root mean - square end - end distance , @xmath73 , over the equilibration period .",
    "consequently , the extension of the polymer at that value of applied force is calculated .",
    "the data was averaged over @xmath74 disorder realizations for the three types of distributions and each value of @xmath2 . in the case of the random distribution ,",
    "the five realizations correspond to five statistically different arrangements of hydrophobic groups along the polymer backbone , for the same value of @xmath2 .",
    "the results obtained from these different realizations were used to calculate the average values and standard deviations of the root mean - square end - end distance of the polymer corresponding to a particular value of force and fraction of hydrophobic groups",
    "figure [ fig : rgvsf ] describes the variation of the radius of gyration , @xmath75 , of a copolymer ( @xmath76 ) as a function of @xmath2 , for all three distributions at zero applied force .",
    "we find that as @xmath2 increases , @xmath75 decreases monotonically for all three cases . an increase in @xmath2 results in aggregation of hydrophobic groups leading to a monotonic decrease in @xmath75 .",
    "the variation of @xmath75 with @xmath2 follows near identical trends for both the random and periodic distributions for the entire range of @xmath2 .",
    "both distributions display a sigmoidal behavior , where the polymer chains show a transition from a coiled state to a collapsed , globular state for @xmath77 .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of @xmath75 with @xmath2 for the block copolymer distribution . for @xmath78 , @xmath75 values for the block copolymer distribution",
    "are close to the ones corresponding to the periodic and random ones .",
    "however , for @xmath79 , the rate of change of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath2 is lower than the other two distributions .",
    "also , the block copolymer does not go through a sharp phase transition as the other two distributions . for @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath75 values for all three distributions tend to a common value . at @xmath81",
    ", @xmath75 is the same for all three distributions .    in the case of a block copolymer ,",
    "the hydrophobic groups at one end form a globule , while the rest of the chain assumes a coil structure .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , a greater fraction of the chain is in the globular state , whereas the hydrophilic block remains as a coil .",
    "consequently , the entire chain does not form a compact globule for any value of @xmath2 apart from @xmath82 . however , for the periodic and random distributions , hydrophobic groups are distributed along the entire polymer chain , which enables attractive interactions between hydrophobic groups that are far separated along the chain contour .",
    "this results in a first order coil - to - globule transition at @xmath83 .",
    "thus , copolymers with @xmath84 and zero bending energy organize themselves as compact globules in solution .",
    "however , the equilibrium structure can change if the bending energy cost ( equivalently , the persistence length , @xmath0 ) increases . in addition , the equilibrium structure can also change if there is a change in the periodicity length , @xmath1 , the length scale over which hydrophobic groups are repeated for a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the periodicity length , @xmath1 , defines the disorder correlation length along the polymer contour .",
    "the choice of @xmath1 in our simulations is such that an integer number of periods make up the contour length , and a fraction @xmath2 of the length @xmath1 would comprise of hydrophobic beads , thus reflecting the overall hydrophobic fraction at that scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : rep - phase-400 ] shows equilibrium morphologies of polymers ( for @xmath61 ) as a function of their persistence length @xmath0 , hydrophobic fraction @xmath2 , and periodicity length , @xmath1 . for a semi - flexible chain , a combination of bending energy with the bending modulus @xmath85 , solvent quality @xmath31 and hybridisation energy between hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments dictates the equilibrium morphology .",
    "the table shows configuration snapshots with increasing bending modulus ( or @xmath0 ) along each row and increasing hydrophobic fraction , @xmath2 , as one moves down a column .",
    "it is seen that for small values of persistence length the equilibrium morphology resembles that of a core - shell like particle with the hydrophilic particles at the surface shielding an inner hydrophobic core . as the hydrophobic fraction increases , there are fewer hydrophilic particles to completely cover the globule surface , which exposes some of the hydrophobic beads to the solvent .    with increasing bending modulus it costs energy to bend the chain over length scales less than or comparable to the persistence length @xmath0 . as a result",
    "the core - shell morphology is not seen .",
    "instead the chain manifests itself in either an extended coil , an elongated fold or a loop like morphology . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : rep - phase-400 ] , these newer structures appear over specific ranges of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . for small values of both @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , a globular configuration for small @xmath0 gives way to a coil - like configuration with increasing @xmath0 . for larger values of @xmath2 or @xmath1 , elongated folds and loops are more common , and especially , dominate the lower right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : rep - phase-400 ] .",
    "a polymer with a large @xmath0 value will bend over longer length scales , and if @xmath1 is also large , then its hydrophobic segments will hybridize over longer lengths along the contour and prefer to form an elongated fold or a loop .",
    "the occurence of these structures will also increase as @xmath2 increases , since hybridization of hydrophobic segments becomes much easier .",
    "thus , the loop configuration is observed for large values of hydrophobic fractions , @xmath88 , periodicities , @xmath89 , and persistence lengths , @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "it must be noted though that the ratio @xmath91 and not @xmath0 alone is the crucial parameter as it sets the scale over which sections of the chain can bend and hybridise .",
    "for example for @xmath92 sections of the chain which are a few persistence lengths apart can bend and hybridise . if however a smaller chain size is chosen _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath59 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rep - phase-100 ] such conformations are not energetically favorable and therefore not observed .",
    "the representative configurations for a chain of contour length @xmath59 and @xmath0 between @xmath93 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath94 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rep - phase-100 ] . two distinct configurations are seen here ; core - shell structures similar to the @xmath61 case for low values of @xmath0 , and extended coils for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "although , simulations for both @xmath59 and @xmath61 were carried out for the same values of @xmath0 , it is interesting to note that we do not observe any loop structures for @xmath59 , and fewer elongated folds for @xmath59 when compared to @xmath61 .",
    "this observation further strengthens the argument that the ratio @xmath91 and not @xmath0 alone is the crucial parameter which determines the equilibrium structure of the copolymer .",
    "phase maps based on the equilibrium morphologies of the polymers for both cases , @xmath59 and @xmath61 , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phase - map-100 ] and [ fig : phase - map-400 ] , respectively . a complete listing of equilibrium structures for both @xmath59 and @xmath61 , for all simulated values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 , can be found in the appendix ( tables  [ tab : appendix-1 ] and [ tab : appendix-2 ] ) .",
    "the phase maps indicate the occurence of a particular equilibrium structure as a function of the hydrophobic fraction , @xmath2 , on the @xmath95axis and a dimensionless parameter , @xmath96 , on the @xmath97axis .",
    "the dimensionless parameter , @xmath96 , reflects the ease of association of hydrophobic segments that are separated from each other along the chain contour by a characteristic distance .    in both cases ,",
    "we find that a narrow globule region exists for very small values of @xmath96 that spans the entire range of values of @xmath2 .",
    "an increase in @xmath96 results in a less compact structure with a larger equilibrium size .",
    "thus , for @xmath59 , larger @xmath96 values result in equiilbrium structures that are either coils or extended coils , and span most of the phase map .",
    "however , for certain intermediate values of @xmath96 and large @xmath2 , there is a narrow region where elongated folds are the equilibrium structures . in the case of @xmath59 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath91 , which defines the degree of flexibility of the polymer backbone , varies between 0.006 - 0.25 . as a result , for large @xmath0 ( where @xmath98 ) , the polymer is semiflexible and does not easily bend to form elongated folds or loops",
    "this explains the complete absence of loops in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - map-100 ] , and the existence of only a very narrow region for elongated folds .    for @xmath61",
    ", @xmath91 varies between 0.001 and 0.0625 ( @xmath99 ) , which makes the polymer flexible over the length , @xmath100 .",
    "regardless , an increase in @xmath0 leads to a decrease in chain flexibility . the resulting phase map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - map-400 ] ) , now shows distinct regions corresponding to all four structures , namely , globule , coil , elongated folds , and loops , respectively .",
    "these structures are distributed across the phase map in the following manner .",
    "core - shell globules are observed for very small values of @xmath101 along the left hand - side of the plot .",
    "the coil region is located in the lower right hand - side of the phase map corresponding to large values of @xmath101 and small values of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , loop structures are found predominantly in the upper right hand - side of the phase map , corresponding to large values of both @xmath101 and @xmath2 .",
    "the loop region also extends into a narrow band that lies between the globule and coil regions for small @xmath2 in the lower part of the phase map .",
    "most of elongated fold structures exist in a region between the globule and loop regions for large @xmath2 .",
    "similar to the behavior of the loop region , the elongated fold region also extends to low values of @xmath2 , and appears as a narrow band between globules and loops .",
    "the occurrence of elongated folds for @xmath61 at lower values of @xmath2 ( @xmath102 ) is in contrast with the phase map for @xmath59 , which is marked by an absence of elongated folded structures at @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is because for @xmath61 , the polymer is less rigid , which makes it easier for hydrophobic segments to hybridize over longer lengths of the chain contour , and form folds even at low @xmath2 . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the chain is more rigid and can form folded structures only when a significant hydrophobic attraction energy at large @xmath2 is able to overcome the bending energy cost .",
    "hence , we do not observe folded structures at low values of @xmath2 .",
    "though different equilibrium configurations of polymers has been reported in this study , an order parameter that distinguishes the different phases have not been identified .",
    "the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - map-100 ] and [ fig : phase - map-400 ] demarcating different regions of parameter space where each phase is stable are guides to the eye drawn through the @xmath105 relative stability for each of the phases .",

    "[ fig : phase - map-400 ] parallel to the @xmath106 axis at a value of @xmath107 demarcates the coil ( indicated by @xmath108 ) and looped ( indicated by @xmath109 ) phases .",
    "a thorough analysis of the phase diagram indicating the lines of metastability and spinodal will be carried out in a future study .",
    "we now compare the force - extension response of copolymers with different distributions of hydrophobic groups .",
    "figure  [ fig : fvsext ] shows force , @xmath110 , vs. extension , @xmath111 , for all three distributions at four different hydrophobic fractions , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath59 .",
    "representative force - extension curves for @xmath116 for the same values of @xmath2 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsext200 ] .",
    "we would like to note two important aspects of the force - extension curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : fvsext ] and [ fig : fvsext200 ] .",
    "first , the force - extension curves correspond to completely flexibile polymers with zero bending energy and @xmath117 .",
    "second , the force - extension curves for the periodic distributions represent the smallest periodicity length , @xmath1 , for a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the force - extension behaviour are discussed in the later part of this section .    for small hydrophobic fraction , @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsext](a ) ) , the chain extension increases monotonically with @xmath110 for all three distributions , with little variation between them . for higher",
    "hydrophobic fractions @xmath118 , a first order globule to coil transition is observed at a critical force , @xmath8 . in the case of periodic and random distributions , the hydrophobic groups , which are distributed along the entire chain contour , hybridize with each other to form a compact globule .",
    "therefore , when the magnitude of the applied force is small , the globule is only slightly distorted from its equilibrium conformation .",
    "consequently , the extension remains nearly constant for small @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast , the block copolymer undergoes a relatively larger extension for smaller values of @xmath110 ( @xmath119 ) for @xmath120 .",
    "this is because in poor solvents , the block copolymer consists of a hydrophobic globule at the end of a flexible , hydrophilic coil that is easy to stretch under the application of a tensile force . once the long wavelength fluctuations along the chain backbone have been smoothed out , the end - to - end distance of the chain remains constant upon an increase in the force @xmath110 .",
    "however , beyond the critical force @xmath8 , the chain unravels undergoing a jump discontinuity in size . on further increase in @xmath110 above @xmath8 , the chain stretches out to full extension .",
    "as is expected , the large force behavior is identical for different disorder realizations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsext ] .",
    "we also note the mechanical response between periodic and random distributions for higher hydrophobic fractions @xmath121 , and @xmath122 past the first order globule - coil phase transition is more pronounced as the chain length is increased from @xmath76 to @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsext ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsext200 ] panels(c ) and ( d ) ) . based on our simulations",
    "we conclude that the force - extension curve for the random distribution lies above that of the periodic ones for the parameters quoted here .",
    "comparing the force - extension curves for @xmath59 and @xmath124 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fvsext ] and [ fig : fvsext200 ] , respectively , we find that both are qualitatively the same . in other words ,",
    "an increase in the chain length does not alter the force - extension response .",
    "in fact , we see the same response for the larger chain lengths , @xmath125 and @xmath56 , that we have simualated ( results not shown here ) . figures  [ fig : fvsext ] and [ fig : fvsext200 ] differ only in the values of @xmath8 , which is slightly higher for @xmath116 and also the response past the transition threshold as alluded to in the earlier paragraph .",
    "this can be expected because the overall binding energy of the globule would increase with increase in the number of hydrophobic groups .",
    "figure  [ fig : fcvsf ] shows the variation of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath126 for all three distributions of hydrophobic groups . for @xmath76 , and @xmath127 , the critical force , @xmath8 , required to uncoil",
    "the polymer chain is zero for all three distributions .",
    "this is because for small @xmath2 , the total number of hydrophobic contacts are few .",
    "thus , the polymer remains in a coil - like state , and starts stretching continuously even for small values of @xmath110 . in case of the block copolymer",
    ", @xmath8 increases discontinuously to a large value of approximately @xmath128 ( from a zero value ) for @xmath83 , and with increasing @xmath2 , @xmath8 quickly saturates to a value of @xmath129 .",
    "in contrast , for the periodic and random distributions , @xmath8 appears to increase linearly with @xmath2 for @xmath130 . for @xmath123 chains and a block copolymer distribution of hydrophobic beads ,",
    "the critical force is nonzero beyond a fraction of @xmath131 .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis ( not shown here ) in which the critical hydrophobic fraction is plotted against @xmath132 yields a value of @xmath133 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath134 .",

    ", we find a core - shell equilibrium morphology with the hydrophilic beads on the outside . in case",
    "the polymer chain is small , similar core - shell morphologies , with some hydrophobic beads exposed are seen .",

    "the critical force , @xmath8 , which characterizes this unfolding event is found to increase almost linearly with the disorder correlation length , @xmath1 .",
    "however , as the persistence length increases more complex folded structures ( elongated folds and loops ) are observed at equilibrium . as a consequence ,",
