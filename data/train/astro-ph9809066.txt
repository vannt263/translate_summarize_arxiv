    "the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey , ( henceforth cfgrs ) , is designed to measure the properties of field galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath2 .",
    "it uses complete samples to a fixed limiting magnitude in a particular bandpass within a small solid angle on the sky .",
    "spectra are obtained for every object in the sample with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( henceforth lris ) ( oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) on the 10  m keck telescope .",
    "the defining features of this program that distinguish it from existing and ongoing or planned surveys , such as the cfa1 survey ( @xcite ) , the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ) , the canada - france redshift survey ( henceforth cfrs ; lilly _ et al . _  1995a ,",
    "b ) , the autofib survey ( @xcite ) , the century survey ( @xcite ) , the eso slice survey ( @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) , the deep survey planned by the lick group ( @xcite ) and the 2df survey ( @xcite ) , are that it is possible to reach to fainter magnitudes ( @xmath3  mag , @xmath4  mag ) and that completeness is emphasized rather than sparse sampling over a large field .",
    "the closest counterpart to this approach is the work of cowie _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) , although we note that the present survey covers a larger solid angle at the survey limit .",
    "see koo & kron ( 1992 ) and ellis ( 1997 ) for reviews of the subject .",
    "there are four limitations to `` pencil beam '' redshift surveys of the type described in the present paper when addressing issues of galaxy evolution .",
    "the first is that the faintest fluxes at which sources can be observed in a complete redshift survey are still over four magnitudes brighter than the fluxes of the faintest detectable sources in imaging data .",
    "the second is that the total number of sources and total sky area are both limited by available telescope time because the faintest possible sources are being studied .",
    "this is particularly relevant to attempts to characterize large scale structure .",
    "the third is that it is difficult to measure spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath5the lower limit is set by the [ o  ii ] line at 3727  moving out of the optical regime , the upper limit by when ly@xmath6 enters it .",
    "this may be a crucial period in the formation and evolution of normal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final limitation is the difficulty of generalizing the observed properties in a small field ( which may contain unique features ) to the properties of the field galaxy population as a whole .",
    "this paper presents spectroscopic results from one field located at j005325 + 1234 , the central region of which is part of the medium deep survey ( @xcite ) and among the deepest fields imaged with hst prior to the hubble deep field .",
    "the field measures @xmath7  arcmin@xmath1 with a statistical sample containing 195 infrared - selected objects complete to @xmath8  mag , of which 24 are spectroscopically confirmed galactic stars and 32 can not be assigned spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "( 21 of these have spectra ) .",
    "there are 13 additional objects with redshifts ( including two more stars ) that are just outside the field boundary or are within the field but too faint .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the sample is defined in  [ sampledef ] , which is followed by a description of the spectroscopic observations and redshift determinations in  [ redshiftdet ] .",
    "the galaxy spectra are assigned to spectroscopic and quality classes , a procedure discussed in  [ specclass ] .",
    "the sample , defined in pahre _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , is selected by the criteria that @xmath9  mag within a @xmath7  arcmin@xmath1 field centered at 00 53 23.20 + 12 33 58 ( j2000 ) . in an effort to cut down the thermal background of the standard johnson @xmath10 filter , which has a central wavelength 2.2@xmath11 m and fwhm 0.4@xmath11 m",
    ", there are at least two non - standard filters in this same atmospheric window in common use : the @xmath12 filter of wainscoat & cowie ( 1992 ) and the @xmath13 ( @xmath10short ) filter of persson ( private communication ) and skrutskie _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the latter is used here , and covers at half maximum transmission the wavelength range @xmath14 m . throughout this series of papers , unless otherwise specified , we use @xmath10 ( denoting the standard johnson filter ) and @xmath13 ( denoting the @xmath10short filter ) interchangeably , although the appropriate @xmath13 transmission curve is used when deriving the @xmath15corrections in cohen et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "this sample contains 195 objects , and we refer to this as the `` main '' sample .",
    "it includes 24 spectroscopically confirmed galactic stars .",
    "the remaining 171 objects constitute the `` galaxy '' sample .",
    "we were able to assign redshifts to 139 of these galaxies and this is the `` redshift '' sample .",
    "redshifts were also obtained for several objects that either had @xmath16  mag or lie just outside the boundary of the sample . a few objects which are very faint at both @xmath17 and @xmath10 turned up serendipitously in slitlets intended for nearby brighter objects . adding these 13 additional objects to the main sample",
    "defines the `` total '' sample of 208 .    the photometric data of pahre _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) are already corrected for reddening by the ism in the galaxy .",
    "the variation in @xmath18 across the small field of our survey is insignificant . as is conventional ,",
    "we ignore reddening internal to the galaxies themselves and from the igm .",
    "the objects in this sample were observed using the lris at the keck observatory beginning in october 1994 and ending in january 1998 .",
    "the lris detector is a @xmath19 pixel tektronix ccd .",
    "its dual amplifier readout mode was normally used to save time .",
    "observations were carried out even when the weather was not photometric .",
    "fifteen slit masks were used .",
    "each mask has 25 to 33 slitlets and many objects were observed more than once .",
    "a few of the brightest galaxies were selected as aids to align the masks , and hence were observed many times .    except for the last three masks ( the 1997 and 1998 data ) , the 300 g / mm grating",
    "was used with 1.1  arcsec wide slits .",
    "this produces a scale of 2.46  / pixel and a resolution of 10 .",
    "( this is @xmath204 times higher spectral resolution than that of the cfrs . )",
    "the spectral coverage is @xmath205000 , with the central wavelength depending on the location of the object on the sky with respect to the centerline of the slitmask as well as on the grating tilt .",
    "two 3000 sec exposures were obtained for each of these masks .",
    "the last three masks , containing most of the faintest objects in the sample , were observed with the 155 g / mm grating with 1.0  arcsec wide slits giving a spectral resolution of 20 . two or three 1800 sec exposures were obtained for each of these slitmasks .",
    "each of these lower dispersion spectra was slightly shifted in central wavelength ( i.e. , dithered spectrally between exposures ) .",
    "this forces a more complex reduction , but better signal - to - noise spectra are achieved .",
    "full spectral coverage from the uv through 10,000  is achieved with this grating for essentially all objects at the price of lower dispersion .",
    "these multi - slit spectra were reduced in a standard way .",
    "the bias ( actually right and left amplifier bias levels ) was subtracted .",
    "then , the relevant pieces were cut out of each of the multi - slit spectra for a particular object ( and out of the flat field calibration exposure ) , cosmic rays were removed , the subsets were flattened and the bowing of the spectra ( the s - distortion ) was removed . when necessary , the distortion in the vertical direction along the slit which manifests itself as tilted night sky lines was also removed .",
    "the night sky lines within the spectra themselves were used to define the wavelength scale ; a third order polynomial fit is sufficient .",
    "this means in effect that there are no `` arc '' lines bluer than 5199 .",
    "sometimes that night sky emission line could not be detected , in which case 5577  became the bluest night sky line .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished by fitting a second order polynomial to a range of pixels above and below the object spectrum .",
    "linear fits were used when necessary , particularly when the object was near the top or bottom edge of the slitlet .",
    "the spectra were reduced by jgc using figaro ( @xcite ) scripts and about 20% were also done by dwh using iraf scripts .",
    "jgc measured all the redshifts uniformly , including remeasurement and in some cases rereduction of the spectra done by dwh as well . the redshifts were measured by visually determining the wavelengths of spectral features from plots of the spectra over various wavelength ranges on an interactive display .",
    "the assignment of rest wavelengths to the observed spectral features was straightforward for the brighter objects and for those objects with strong emission lines , but became more difficult for the faint objects showing only absorption line spectra .    while a manual redshift determination may seem outmoded in light of more automatic techniques such as that developed by glazebrook , offer , & deeley ( 1998 ) for the 2df or that of kurtz & mink ( 1998 ) for the cfa surveys , in this situation it is more appropriate . here",
    "the objects are very faint relative to the background sky , the snr is low , the sky subtraction is difficult , the exposures are long ( thus increasing the number of cosmic ray hits ) , and most importantly we do not fully understand what features to expect in the spectra of such faint and distant galaxies .",
    "construction of a set of templates for a machine based redshift search from ( or even for ) this data set would be impossible .",
    "the spectra have been fluxed using long slit observations of standard stars from oke ( 1990 ) taken with the same lris configuration as was used for the multi - slits .",
    "the absolute scale of a fluxed spectrum should be regarded with caution , as the nights were not all photometric , there are substantial slit losses for the more extended objects , and slitmask alignment causes an additional light loss which is variable from mask to mask and from object to object on a given mask . however , the _ shape _ of the continuum for a particular object should be more or less correct , and is often quite useful .",
    "redshifts were measured for each object in each of the slitmasks .",
    "records were also kept of the results for any serendipitous objects that fell onto slits for other targeted galaxies . at the end , the results were compiled , and the very small number of objects with multiple observations that showed discrepancies were studied more carefully to resolve them .",
    "this involved summing all the spectra together , examining the wavelength range of each of the spectra , etc .",
    "the most difficult cases involved objects that show no emission features , but only absorption lines which do not correspond to the standard pattern of balmer lines , h+k doublet , etc . seen in the region of the 4000  break .",
    "since the 4000  region is redshifted into the strong night sky emission lines redward of the optical bandpass for @xmath21 , it was suspected that for such objects @xmath21 . to deal with these particular cases ,",
    "the spectra were compared directly with spectra of high redshift galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the sum of spectra of absorption line galaxies in a cluster at @xmath22 = 1.50 kindly supplied by j.  b.  oke , as well as the sums of spectra of galaxies in the higher redshift peaks in the present sample .",
    "the library of mean ultraviolet spectral energy distributions for stellar groups from iue spectra ( @xcite ) and those of model galaxies from the grid of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) were also examined .",
    "the absorption features in the spectra of many of those objects suspected to be at @xmath21 are real and repeatable .",
    "the uncertainty in the redshifts is because of limited knowledge of this spectral region ( for which the 2800  region is shifted into the optical ) and lack of confidence when there are only two certain features in a spectrum , both absorption lines , as to what the correct identification should be .",
    "a good example is d0k42 ( which has @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , which could have either @xmath25 or the final adopted value of @xmath26 depending on whether the identification assigned to the strongest absorption features is h+k of or 2800 + 2850  ( + ) . in this case , the spectral energy distribution of the fluxed spectra and the absence of a 4000  jump in the @xmath25 case were considered to be persuasive evidence for the higher value .    the composite quasar spectrum of francis _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1991 ) provided a template for line identification in the broad emission line objects .",
    "we assign a quality class to the redshift of each object to give an indication of the associated uncertainty .",
    "table  1 lists the quality classes ( 0 through 9 ) with a brief description of each .",
    "objects with multiple features are assigned quality class 1  3 redshifts , depending upon the security of the redshift .",
    "centroiding uncertainties for high snr spectra are generally considered to be less than @xmath27  fwhm , but with the lower snr prevalent here , we adopt a fwhm as a more appropriate uncertainty .",
    "( the uncertainty from the wavelength fit itself using the night sky lines is small by comparison . ) for a feature at 6000  with @xmath28 , a 2 pixel error with the 300 g / mm grating corresponds to a redshift uncertainty @xmath29 .",
    "single emission line spectra are placed in classes 4,5 .",
    "the emission line is always assumed to be 3727  [ ] .",
    "the cfrs has adopted a similar strategy ( @xcite ) , although their situation is more complex as they are more likely to have confusion between 3727  emission and h@xmath6 emission due to the preponderance of lower redshift galaxies in the cfrs . in our case , with our relatively broad spectral coverage , the absence of h@xmath30 or 4959  emission serves to rule out the possibility that a single emission line is 5007  of [ ] .",
    "it can not be h@xmath6 for lines that appear at wavelengths bluer than the rest wavelength of h@xmath6 , while for redder lines , one would then expect to see h@xmath30 or the 5007  [ ] line in emission .",
    "the only other serious possibility consistent with the absence of features in optical spectra with broad spectral coverage is ly@xmath6 ; this is a serious possibility for some of the faintest objects in the sample , particularly the serendipitous ones , where only a single emission line from a very faint object falls by chance onto our slit , cf .",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) . in such cases ,",
    "broad band colors might be used to look for breaks or uv dropouts , although we have chosen to assign redshifts on the basis of spectroscopy alone .",
    "the presence of a few high redshift objects in our sample should not affect our conclusions which are restricted to the properties of galaxies with @xmath31 .",
    "objects showing a single break , assumed to be the 4000  break , are assigned quality class 8 .",
    "again this is a conservative choice , since at a modest redshift well within the range covered by our survey , the break just to the red of the doublet at 2800  will lie in the optical .",
    "there are only two objects in this class in the total sample .",
    "quality class 9 is for objects showing a single strong absorption feature which , because of the shape of the continuum , we interpret as + at 2800 + 2850  rather than as ca",
    "h+k . there are only three such objects .",
    "quality class 0 is for objects with very low signal and no redshift .    for future reference",
    ", the term `` high quality redshifts '' refers to those with a quality class indicating a secure @xmath22 , specifically quality classes 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 .    to demonstrate that the quality class 1 spectra ( which comprise more than 50% of the extragalactic objects ) actually do have the precision claimed above , figure  1 shows the values of @xmath32 calculated from multiple spectra of a single object where each individual measurement has a quality 1 rating as a function of @xmath17 magnitude .",
    "only the galaxies with multiple spectra among the 60 brightest objects in the sample were used .",
    "there are four or more spectra for three of these galaxies .",
    "a simple spectral classification was used ( table  2 ) .",
    "`` @xmath33 '' ( emission ) denotes an galaxy where the emission lines dominate the spectrum , while the few extreme starburst galaxies that could be identified are denoted by `` @xmath34 '' . in the subsequent discussion",
    ", these two classes are usually referred to collectively as `` @xmath33 '' ( emission ) galaxies .",
    "`` @xmath35 '' ( absorption ) denotes an object where no emission lines are detected , while `` @xmath36 '' ( composite ) is an intermediate case where both emission and absorption ( usually 3727 and h+k ) are seen . when both 3727 and 5007  emission lines are present , the object is denoted `` @xmath33 '' , or , if the absorption spectrum is also visible , `` @xmath37 '' .",
    "the three agn are designated `` @xmath38 '' .",
    "in addition , stars are classified according to the presence or absence of tio bands ( and/or cah bands , for m subdwarfs ) as `` @xmath39 '' or `` @xmath40''and , although there are no examples in the present sample , as `` @xmath41 '' for white dwarfs .",
    "the assignment of a spectral class to a galaxy will depend on its redshift and on the wavelength range covered by the observations .",
    "for example , a galaxy at low redshift with strong emission at 3727 and 5007  will be classified as `` @xmath33 '' , but the same object if seen at @xmath42 when the 2800  region is observed in the optical will show no apparent emission features and will be listed as `` @xmath35 '' .",
    "this is particularly true for objects where the spectral coverage of the data did not extend to @xmath43 .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath44 , an `` @xmath35 '' galaxy is an object that has a spectrum similar to that of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "but at higher redshift , only the strongest emission lines can be detected through the thicket of night sky lines , and a much more diverse group of galaxies will be classified as `` @xmath35 '' based on the presence of absorption lines in the 2500  region .",
    "figure  2 gives illustrative examples of the five spectral classes used for extragalactic objects .",
    "the spectrum of the second brightest agn and the second brightest starburst galaxy are shown , while for the other three spectral classes , the spectrum of the fifth brightest galaxy ( at @xmath17 ) assigned to that class is shown .",
    "the observed @xmath17 magnitudes and @xmath22 are indicated for each object . for the agn and the spectral class `` @xmath36 '' galaxy ,",
    "the residuals from sky subtraction around the very strong night sky line at 5577  were removed by interpolation .",
    "the `` @xmath36 '' galaxy shown has a rather weak 3727  emission line compared to most of the objects in this galaxy spectral class , but the distinction between `` @xmath36 '' and `` @xmath35 '' spectral classes is still clear from the relative strengths of absorption of h and k of caii , the balmer lines , and the molecular bands of ch and cn in this spectral region . the spectrum of a somewhat more typical higher-@xmath22 `` @xmath36 '' galaxy is also shown for comparison .    as will be discussed in cohen _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , there are many galaxies in this field with @xmath45 . at this redshift , the 3727  emission line of [ ] , a key spectral type diagnostic ,",
    "is observed at 5889 , where it overlaps the strong nad doublet in emission from the night sky .",
    "unless the emission from such a galaxy at 3727  [ ] is very strong , it may be lost in the uncertainty of subtracting away the much stronger night sky line .",
    "thus , for this redshift only , the distinction between `` @xmath35 '' and `` @xmath36 '' spectral types has been made on the basis of the presence of the 3880  cn band and the g band of ch at 4300 .",
    "we assign such a galaxy a spectral class of `` @xmath35 '' if those molecular bands are strong , while objects that show 4101  h@xmath46 absorption in their spectra are assigned the spectral class `` @xmath36 '' . a check of 19 objects originally classified as `` @xmath35 '' in this redshift regime revealed three that had to be reclassified from `` @xmath35 '' to `` @xmath36 '' on this basis as well as three others too faint to determine which classification is most appropriate without the guidance of 3727emission , which were left as `` @xmath35 '' .",
    "for the brighter part of this sample with high precision spectra , considerably finer distinction among galaxy spectral classes is possible .",
    "a detailed discussion of the spectral features in the brighter galaxies of this sample is deferred to a future paper ( cohen et al 1999 ) .",
    "table  3 lists the object numbers , positions on the sky , measured @xmath10 magnitudes ( from @xcite ) , redshifts , spectral types , and quality classes for 195 objects in the main sample , followed by the 13 additional objects that constitute the total sample .",
    "table  4 gives the distribution of objects in the main sample over the spectral and redshift quality classes .    within the main sample ,",
    "84% of the objects have measured redshifts .",
    "the completeness is shown as a function of observed @xmath17 and of observed @xmath10 magnitude in figure  3 . as expected and supported by figure  3 , it is the @xmath17 magnitude that primarily determines whether or not a redshift can be measured , rather than the @xmath10 magnitude .",
    "the median @xmath17 magnitude of the objects never observed is 24.6  mag , while the median @xmath17 magnitude of the 21 objects that were observed , but for which no redshift was determined , is 24.3 mag .",
    "this latter group can not contain any strong emission line objects with @xmath47 otherwise their spectra would have already yielded redshifts .",
    "all of the objects with redshifts in the main sample have @xmath17 , @xmath48 and @xmath10 magnitudes from the data of pahre _ et al . _  ( 1998 ) , but several are too faint to be detected in the available @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 images .",
    "the median redshift of the extragalactic objects in the main sample with measured @xmath22 is 0.58 .",
    "even if it is assumed that all of the objects without redshifts are galaxies with @xmath21 , then the median redshift can only increase to @xmath52 .",
