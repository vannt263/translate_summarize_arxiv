    "the best monitored afterglows ( grbs 970228 , 970508 , 980326 , 980519 , 990123 , 990510 ) exhibit a variety of behaviors , indicating that the shape of the optical decay must be determined not only by the intrinsic physics , but also by the nature , structure and composition of the surrounding medium . therefore , optical light curves of grb counterparts need to be frequently sampled for long time intervals , to follow the evolution of the afterglow and to allow mapping the characteristics of the medium .",

    "( 7 arcsec ) of the target to a bright star , we chose to use standard psf - fitting as our photometric technique , and for this purpose we used the daophot ii image data analysis package psf - fitting algorithm ( stetson 1987 ) running within _ midas_. a two - dimensional gaussian with two free parameters ( the half width at half maxima along @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates of each frame ) was modeled on at least 5 non - saturated bright stars in each image .",
    "for each filter , this procedure yields frames magnitude differences among the photometric references of less than 1% in all frames .",
    "the errors associated with the measurements reported in table 1 represent statistical uncertainties ( at 1@xmath12 ) , obtained with the standard psf - fitting procedure .",

    "the source variability ( see magnitude levels in table 1 ) suggests that this is the afterglow of grb000301c .",
    "the light curves in @xmath0 bands are reported in fig .",
    "1 , where our data are complemented with those published by other authors ( sagar et al . 2000 , jensen et al . 2000 , and the gcn circulars archive ) . note that some results presented in this paper supersede preliminary values reported in gcns .",
    "our analysis of upso @xmath1 band data yielded results consistent with those reported by sagar et al .",
    "no correction has been applied for galactic extinction , which is anyway small in the direction of the grb ( @xmath19 = 0.052 , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) ; nor has been subtracted any host galaxy continuum emission , this being negligible ( fruchter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a 5% systematic error was added in quadrature to the errors reported in figs . 1 and 2 to take into account possible photometric discrepancies due to the use of different telescopes and instruments .    the @xmath1 band light curve , the best sampled , exhibits in its early portion a flaring activity with hour time scale ( fig .",
    "1 ) , with an initial increase ( confirmed by s.g .",
    "bhargavi , priv . comm . ) .",
    "the flux then shows a slow decline , lasting about 1.5 days and following approximately a power - law , with a slope @xmath20 0.7 ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the grb trigger time ) .",
    "subsequently the light curve flattens , and an approximately constant , or slightly increasing , behavior is seen till around 3.7 days after the grb .",
    "the flux starts decreasing again thereafter .",
    "this decline , which can be fitted by a very steep power - law ( index @xmath20 3.5 ) , levels off around 5 days after the grb trigger to a  plateau \" of two days duration .",
    "the flux resumes then the decreasing trend , with a shallower power - law of @xmath20 3 , till the end of the monitoring . the late @xmath1 band epoch flux and upper limit reported by fruchter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and veillet ( 2000 ) , respectively , are consistent with this trend .",
    "the @xmath23 band light curve appears well correlated with the @xmath1 band , though less well sampled .",
    "the @xmath23 band points at 3.5 and 3.7 days after the grb suggest a variation opposite to that observed simultaneously in the @xmath1 band .",
    "however , the @xmath23 band variation is not significant and determines only a marginally significant change in the @xmath24 color ( fig .",
    "the @xmath23 band upper limit determined on april 5 with the tng is consistent with the power - law decline of the final portion of the light curve .",
    "the fewer @xmath25 band points show a good correlation of the light curve with that in the @xmath1 band , with no measurable temporal lag ( the @xmath26 color is unchanged , fig .",
    "2b ) . in particular , the @xmath25 band data around 3 - 4 days after the high - energy event also suggest a local flattening of the light curve .",
    "the @xmath27 band data confirm the general steepening observed in the other bands , although the second plateau at 5 - 7 days after the high - energy event is less clearly seen than in the @xmath23 and @xmath1 light curves .",
    "also , a rapid flux increase is apparent at the beginning of the @xmath27 band monitoring , delayed by @xmath47 hours with respect to that seen in the @xmath1 band light curve ( see figs . 1 and 2c ) .",
    "our optical monitoring of the bright grb000301c afterglow has provided one of the best sampled afterglow datasets , especially in the @xmath1 filter .",
    "the long term behavior of this optical afterglow is better described by a continuous steepening , rather than by a single power - law , as expected in afterglows developing in laterally spreading jets ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ; rhoads 1999 ) or decelerating to non - relativistic regimes ( dai & lu 1999 ) , and seen in few other cases .    among equally well monitored grb afterglows , gr000301c appears peculiar in that several shorter time scale variations are superimposed on the long term decrease .",
    "the reality of two of these ( 3.1 - 3.7 days and 5 - 7 days after the event ) is supported by their appearance in more than one band .",
    "the first two points of the @xmath1 and @xmath27 band light curves might suggest a rise and could be reminiscent of the early ( 1 - 2 days after the grb trigger ) light curve of grb970228 and grb970508 ( guarnieri et al . 1997 ; pedersen et al . 1998 ) , although in the latter the initial increase was more structured . in the present case",
    "we can not exclude that the flux is declining since the start of the monitoring , and hour time scale flares modulate this decrease .",
    "some isolated short term variability events are seen in grb980703 ( vreeswijk et al . 1999 ) and grb990123 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ) and are almost totally absent in grb990510 ( e.g. , stanek et al . 1999 ) .",
    "recently , various scenarios have been developed in which intrinsic re - energization of the blast wave , or irregularities of the dense interstellar medium in which the blast is expanding can account for the observed behavior ( panaitescu et al .",
    "1998 ; mszros et al . 1998 ; sari & mszros 2000 ; wang & loeb 2000 ; dai & lu 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , a flattening of the afterglow light curve , similar to that exhibited by grb000301c in the @xmath1 band on days 3.1 - 3.7 and 5 - 7 days after the grb , is predicted by kumar & piran ( 2000 ) as a consequence of the collision of a slow shell ejected at a late time after the grb with an outer shell decelerated by its propagation in the circumburst medium ( see their fig . 5 ) .",
    "we note that the temporal occurrence of the observed flattenings could be consistent with a  colliding shells \" interpretation , while it is incompatible with the time scale implied by an hypernova scenario ( see rhoads & fruchter 2000 )",
    ".    the lack of a clear correlation between the @xmath1 band light curve and the @xmath27 and @xmath28 band light curves ( see rhoads & fruchter 2000 for the latter ) might be due to non strict simultaneity of the data points .",
    "in fact , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 colors as a function of time show only marginally significant deviations from constancy ( fig . 2c and 2d ) , and these are mainly exhibited by color values derived from pairs of measurements separated in time by more than 0.5 hours , the shortest variability time scale observed in this afterglow .",
    "our findings underline the critical importance of intensive multiwavelength observations of afterglow sources .",
    "we thank the staff of the loiano , calar alto , sierra nevada , upso and tng observatories .",
