    "lanthanide - doped nanocrystals are especially promising since their light is emitted from a single atom which is shielded from the environment . as such ,",
    "these new sources are immune to the two major disadvantages of today s emitters : the temporary loss of fluorescence ( blinking ) which is a common feature of quantum dots @xcite and permanent loss of fluorescence ( photobleaching ) which is the major disadvantage of molecular emitters @xcite .",
    "the reliable emission and perfect photostability of lanthanide - doped nanocrystals promise the full control of light - matter interaction at the nanoscale . as a dopant , cerium ( ce@xmath1 ) has strong advantages compared to other lanthanides @xcite .",
    "ce@xmath1-doped nanocrystals have high quantum efficiency due to 5d-4f dipole ce@xmath1 allowed transition . because of the large oscillator strength of the transition , they are extremely bright and fast .",
    "a particularly interesting ce@xmath1-doped nanocrystal is ce@xmath1-doped yttrium aluminum garnet @xmath0 ( yag : ce@xmath1 ) . in bulk , yag : ce@xmath1 is a well - known inorganic compound which has excellent chemical , physical and optical properties @xcite .",

    "it is reported that yag : ce@xmath1 nanocrystals perform better than larger particles for white led application @xcite while they also exhibit no blinking and no bleaching @xcite while ce@xmath1 emission lifetime in yag of 60 ns is relatively four times slower with that of the fastest of 15 ns in ce@xmath1 with different hosts @xcite .",

    ", we may enhance the emissive process into one particular propagating plasmon mode which can be further transferred into a photonic mode of an optical waveguide with high efficiency @xcite .",
    "in the previous experiments , the coupling of individual single light sources to propagating surface plasmon modes on individual metallic nws has been demonstrated for cdse quantum dots @xcite , fluorescent dyed spheres @xcite , and for nv centers in nanocrystal diamonds @xcite , where most emission rate enhancements were in the range of 1.7 - 2.5 folds . .",
    "after collecting four samples , we obtain an average of emission rate enhancements of 2.9 folds .",

    "@xcite . for explaining both observations of yag : ce@xmath1 nanocrystals and fluorescent dyed spheres , we model our single light sources in the proximity of the gold nw with a combination of the lifetime calculations from distribution of emitters inside a sphere based on the analytical model of an electric dipole @xcite and a toolbox for the simulation of metallic nanoparticles ( mnp ) , using a boundary element method ( bem ) approach @xcite",
    "yag : ce@xmath1 ( 0.5 mol@xmath3 ) nanocrystals were prepared by using a combustion synthesis technique @xcite , which was optimized to yield nanoparticles of about @xmath4 20 nm with a small degree of sintering . however , they usually formed micrometer - size clusters as shown in fig .",

    "the yag : ce@xmath1 clusters are highly friable and can be easily broken apart into myriad of nanocrystals by sonic waves ( sonic bath ) for half an hour . the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) image from pristine yag : ce@xmath1 nanocrystals is depicted in fig .",

    "the enhancements for fluorescent dyed spheres are the same with the earlier observation @xcite .",
    "the larger enhancements in yag : ce@xmath1 nanocrystals to those in fluorescent dyed spheres can be strongly correlated either with the refractive index or the diameter of the light sources . in the following discussions",
