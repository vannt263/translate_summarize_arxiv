    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful in explaining a range of observations at hadron colliders and the cern @xmath12 collider , lep .",
    "but it is still widely believed to be an effective theory valid at the electroweak scale , with new physics lying beyond it . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite is widely considered to be the most promising candidate for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the mssm contains supersymmetric ( susy ) partners of quarks , gluons and other sm particles which have not been observed , leading to speculation that they might be too heavy to have observable production rates at present collider energies .",
    "however it has been suggested in @xcite that a light sbottom ( @xmath1 ) with mass @xmath13(@xmath14 gev ) is not ruled out by electroweak precision data if its coupling to the @xmath15 boson is tuned to be small in the mssm .",
    "recently berger _",
    "et al _ @xcite have also proposed a light sbottom and light gluino ( lslg ) model to explain the long - standing puzzle of overproduction of @xmath3 quarks at the tevatron @xcite . in this model gluinos of mass @xmath0 gev",
    "are produced in pairs in @xmath16 collisions and decay quickly into a @xmath3 quark and light sbottom ( @xmath2 gev ) each .",
    "the sbottom evades direct detection by quickly undergoing @xmath17-parity violating decays into soft dijets of light quarks around the cone of the accompanying @xmath3 jet .",
    "the extra @xmath3 quarks so produced result in a remarkably good fit to the measured transverse momentum distribution @xmath18 at nlo level , including data enhancement in the @xmath19 region .",
    "some independent explanations within the sm have also been proposed to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "these include unknown nnlo qcd effects , updated @xmath3-quark fragmentation functions @xcite and effects from changing the renormalization scale @xcite .",
    "but , without an unambiguous reduction in theoretical and experimental errors , the lslg scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "it is also interesting in its own right even if not solely responsible for the tevatron discrepancy .",
    "for example , a light @xmath1 is more natural if the gluino is also light @xcite .",
    "experimental bounds on light gluinos do not apply here as either the mass range or the decay channel is different : only gluinos lighter than @xmath20 gev @xcite are absolutely ruled out .",
    "very recently aleph @xcite has ruled out stable sbottoms with lifetime @xmath21 ns and mass @xmath22 gev .",
    "however , using formulae in @xcite we calculate that even minimal @xmath17-parity violating couplings , as small as @xmath23 times experimental limits , would leave @xmath1 with a lifetime shorter than @xmath24 ns .",
    "light gluino and sbottom contributions to the running strong coupling constant @xmath25(@xmath26 ) have also been calculated and found to be small @xcite .",
    "new phenomenon such as susy @xmath15-decays @xcite and gluon splitting into gluinos @xcite are predicted in this scenario , but the rates are either too small or require more careful study of lep data .",
    "the sbottoms and light gluinos also affect electroweak precision observables through virtual loops . in this case , serious constraints arise on the heavier eigenstate of the sbottom , i.e. @xmath4 . according to @xcite , corrections to @xmath27 are increasingly negative as @xmath4 becomes heavier and it has to be lighter than @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) gev at the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) level .",
    "an extension of this analysis to the entire range of electroweak precision data @xcite yields that @xmath4 must be lighter than @xmath5 gev at @xmath7 level .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the susy decay @xmath32 can contribute positively to @xmath27 @xcite , reducing some of the negative loop effects , and possibly allowing higher @xmath4 masses @xcite .",
    "independently , if large @xmath33-violating phases are present in the model a @xmath4 with mass @xmath34 gev is possible @xcite .",
    "still , it is fair to say that in the face of electroweak constraints the lslg model at least favors a @xmath4 lighter than @xmath35 gev or so .    in this article we study",
    "production and decay of such a heavy sbottom at lepii .",
    "available channels are ( i ) pair production : @xmath36 and ( ii ) associated production : @xmath37 . with lepii center - of - mass energies ranging upto @xmath38 gev ,",
    "the second channel should have produced heavy sbottoms with masses as high as @xmath39 gev .",
    "since they have not been observed , it has been commented that the lslg scenario is disfavored @xcite .",
    "however , searches for unstable sbottoms at lepii have not been done for the decay @xmath40 , which should dominate in this scenario as squarks , quarks and gluinos have strong trilinear couplings in the mssm . in that case",
    ", the fast - moving gluino emitted by @xmath4 would decay quickly into a @xmath3 quark and @xmath1 that are nearly collinear , with @xmath1 subsequently undergoing @xmath17-parity violating decays into light quarks around the cone of the accompanying @xmath3-jet . unless the jet resolution is set very high",
    ", the gluino should look like a fused @xmath3 flavored jet .",
    "overall @xmath4 should appear as a heavy particle decaying into @xmath3 flavored dijets .",
    "on the other hand , the highly boosted prompt @xmath1 produced in the associated process would decay into nearly collinear light quarks and appear as a single hadronic jet .",
    "pair and associated production are therefore naturally described as 4-jet and 3-jet processes respectively at leading order .",
    "pair production in particular should be similar to neutral mssm higgs production in the channel @xmath10 if @xmath41 and @xmath42 have approximately equal masses .",
    "the article is organised as follows : @xmath4 decays are studied in section ii and @xmath40 is found to be dominant , cross - sections and event topology are studied in section iii and the corresponding sm 3-jet background for associated production is studied in section iv . in section",
    "v , lep searches for neutral higgs bosons are used to derive a lower bound on @xmath4 mass .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "sbottom decays in mssm scenarios with large mass splitting between @xmath4 and @xmath1 have been investigated before ; see @xcite for example .",
    "however the scenario where the gluino is also light has not received much attention .",
    "the direct decay products can be purely fermionic ( 1 ) or bosonic ( 2 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 are neutralinos and charginos respectively , @xmath47 is the top quark , @xmath48 are stops , @xmath41 and @xmath49 are neutral @xmath33-even higgs bosons , @xmath42 is the @xmath33-odd higgs and @xmath50 are charged higgs bosons .",
    "the individual widths depend on masses of above particles , but available experimental constraints @xcite are model - dependent and might not all be applicable in the lslg scenario .",
    "however precision @xmath15-width measurements can be used to apply some basic constraints on masses and the sbottom mixing angle .      in the mssm ,",
    "@xmath15-boson couplings to sbottom pairs are given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mixing angle between left and right - handed states : @xmath53 the light sbottom should have a vanishingly small coupling in eqn .",

    "this is achieved with the choice @xmath55 the narrow range @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is allowed @xcite which we use at times to obtain upper and lower bounds .",
    "given that @xmath58 gev , the decay @xmath59 might also take place if @xmath4 is lighter than @xmath60 gev .",
    "however this decay is suppressed both kinematically and by the factor @xmath61 . even for the higher value @xmath62",
    "we calculate @xmath63 mev for @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev .",
    "with the full @xmath15-width having a @xmath66 error of @xmath67 mev and a @xmath68 pull from the theoretical sm calculation @xcite , a lower limit of @xmath69 gev on @xmath4-mass can be set at @xmath70 level without a detailed analysis .",
    "similarly , decays into pairs of neutralinos , charginos and stops might contribute unacceptably to the @xmath15 width and it seems safe enough to apply a lower mass limit of @xmath71 to them for calculation purposes . with the observed top quark mass of @xmath72 gev ,",
    "this rules out the chargino channel @xmath73 as @xmath4 masses @xmath74 gev are being considered .",
    "the decay width for @xmath40 is easily calculated at tree - level using feynman rules for the mssm given in @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( summing over all particles involved in the decay ) is the usual kinematic factor and @xmath78 is the strong coupling evaluated at @xmath79 .",

    "our calculation is most likely an overestimate as mixing angles are ignored and all neutralinos are prescribed the same mass .",
    "this channel has been extensively searched for at lep @xcite , but seems to be at most @xmath95 of the full width in the lslg scenario .",
    "bosonic decays with @xmath96 , @xmath15 in the final state are also found to be small .",
    "we show @xmath97 correct upto an unknown factor @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the stop mixing angle .",
    "for @xmath100 the factor would be @xmath101 . because of the unnaturally low value of @xmath102 mass chosen here , this width rises significantly as @xmath103 approaches @xmath35 gev .",
    "decays into higgs bosons are more complex as besides higgs masses , the widths depend on unknown soft susy - breaking mass terms @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the only available mass constraint is @xmath106 gev at two - loop level in the mssm .",
    "however the excellent agreement between electroweak precision measurements and theoretical predictions with a single sm higgs boson has led to a preference for the `` decoupling limit '' of the mssm higgs sector . in this limit ,",

    "@xmath107 have almost degenerate masses @xmath108 .",

    "though theoretically and experimentally attractive , if the decoupling limit does not hold then other higgs particles might also be light .",
    "the most general lower mass limits from lep on neutral mssm higgs bosons are about @xmath11 gev @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath118 width ( say ) can become larger than @xmath119 of @xmath120 due to the coupling @xmath121 this happens if @xmath122 is larger than @xmath123 tev .",
    "though the possibility is there , we consider it less likely and do not pursue it further . in any event",
    "such a decay would be more important for higher @xmath4 masses , and we show in section iii that @xmath4 production at lepii falls rapidly as its mass nears @xmath35 gev .",
    "we therefore conclude that the strong decay @xmath40 is dominant and other decays are unlikely to be of more than marginal importance at lepii .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows @xmath128 versus @xmath4-mass at @xmath145 gev .",

    "the missing photon channel and smaller @xmath138-factor , @xmath149 , reduces the cross - section further .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the expected number of raw events .",

    "we decay the gluinos into @xmath158 pairs and show the opening angles between final products for some representative @xmath4 masses in fig .",

    "in that case , the @xmath1 arising from gluino decay would further decay hadronically in and around the cone of the accompanying @xmath3 jet .",
    "in practise it would be difficult to distinguish between the overlapping jets , unless a very fine jet resolution is used .",
    "the gluino should then appear for the most part as a single fused @xmath3-flavored jet with perhaps some extra activity around the cone .",
    "the prompt @xmath1 from associated production is highly boosted for most @xmath4 masses within range .",
    "this should result in a very small angular separation between its decay products .",

    "therefore in the observable range @xmath1 should show up as a single hadronic jet .    at leading order",
    "then , associated production is best described as a 3-jet process , with 2 jets that can be tagged as @xmath3 quarks and a hadronic jet from @xmath1 . the relevant background for this would be sm 3-jet events which we discuss in section iv .     opening angles between particle pairs in ( a ) pair production and ( b ) associated production at @xmath145 gev .",

    "<S> a low - energy supersymmetry scenario with a light gluino of mass @xmath0 gev and light sbottom ( @xmath1 ) of mass @xmath2 gev has been used to explain the apparent overproduction of @xmath3 quarks at the tevatron . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the other mass eigenstate of the sbottom , i.e. @xmath4 , is favored to be lighter than @xmath5 gev due to constraints from electroweak precision data . </S>",
    "<S> we survey its decay modes in this scenario and show that decay into a @xmath3 quark and gluino should be dominant . </S>",
    "<S> associated sbottom production at lep via @xmath6 is studied and we show that it is naturally a three - jet process with a small cross - section , increasingly obscured by a large standard model background for heavier @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however we find that direct observation of a @xmath4 at the @xmath7 level is possible if it is lighter than @xmath8 gev , depending on the sbottom mixing angle @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that @xmath4-pair production can be mistaken for production of neutral mssm higgs bosons in the channel @xmath10 . using searches for the latter we place a lower mass limit of @xmath11 gev on @xmath4 . </S>"
