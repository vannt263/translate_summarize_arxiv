    "a remarkable property of two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulent flows is their ability to organize spontaneously into coherent structures such as large - scale vortices and jets ( bouchet and venaille 2012 ) .",
    "a famous example of this self - organization is jupiter s great red spot ( grs ) , a huge anticyclonic vortex persisting for more than three centuries in the southern hemisphere of the planet .",
    "this self - organization of 2d turbulence into large - scale vortices shares fascinating analogies with the self - organization of stellar systems in astrophysics ( chavanis _ et al _ 1996 , chavanis 2002 ) .",
    "basically , geophysical and astrophysical flows are described by the 2d euler equations or by their generalizations ( quasi - geostrophic equations , shallow - water equations , primitive equations ... ) .",
    "the 2d euler - poisson system is known to develop a complicated mixing process generating vorticity filaments at smaller and smaller scales . at the same time",
    ", this mixing process leads to the formation of coherent structures at large scales which look quasistationary provided that a coarse - graining procedure is introduced to smooth out the filaments . in order to explain this self - organization ,",
    "a statistical theory of the 2d euler equation has been proposed by miller ( 1990 ) and robert and sommeria ( 1991 ) .",
    "this statistical theory is the counterpart of the theory of violent relaxation proposed by lynden - bell ( 1967 ) for the vlasov - poisson system describing collisionless stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies . in the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs )",
    "theory , the statistical equilibrium state of the 2d euler equation ( most probable or most mixed state ) is obtained by maximizing a mixing entropy while conserving the energy and the infinite family of casimirs .    of course , the evolution of the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath1 which averages over the filaments and which relaxes towards a quasistationary state is _ not _ given by the 2d euler equation .",
    "we expect that it satisfies a kinetic equation that relaxes towards the maximum entropy state . actually , the relaxation towards the maximum entropy state is not granted since it depends on an hypothesis of ergodicity ( or at least efficient mixing ) that is not always satisfied . indeed , there are many situations in which the evolution of the system is non - ergodic so that the qss differs from the statistical prediction .",
    "an interesting problem is to determine the kinetic equation satisfied by the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath1 .",
    "this is interesting not only at a conceptual level , but also at a practical level . indeed , it is generally not possible to solve the 2d euler equations for the fine - grained vorticity @xmath2 exactly because they develop small - scale filaments that ultimately lead to numerical instabilities .",
    "in addition , we are generally not interested in the small scales but only in the largest scales .",
    "indeed , the observations are always realized with a finite resolution . it is therefore desirable to have an equation for the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath3 that parametrizes at best the small scales and that describes the evolution of the large scales only .",
    "usual parametrizations introduce a turbulent viscosity in the euler equations in order to smooth out the small - scale filaments and prevent numerical instabilities . however , this artificial viscosity breaks the conservation of energy .",
    "it is therefore important to consider more general parametrizations of 2d turbulence that smooth out the small scales while conserving the energy .    in relation to the statistical theory of the 2d euler equation ,",
    "some relaxation equations have been proposed by robert and sommeria ( 1992 ) based on a phenomenological maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) .",
    "these equations are constructed so as to increase the mixing entropy ( @xmath0-theorem ) while conserving all the invariants of the inviscid dynamics ( the energy and the casimirs ) and to relax towards the maximum entropy state .",
    "these equations provide a thermodynamical parametrization of 2d turbulence . in this approach",
    ", the energy is conserved globally thanks to a uniform lagrange multiplier @xmath4 which has the interpretation of a global inverse temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to apply the mepp by enforcing a _",
    "local _ conservation of energy .",
    "this leads to an equation for the vorticity distribution that conserves all the casimirs , the energy , and that increases monotonically the mixing entropy .",
    "however , this equation does not generally converge towards the statistical equilibrium state of the 2d euler equation .",
    "the equation for the coarse - grained vorticity dissipates monotonically all the generalized enstrophies and the vorticity current vanishes for _ any _ steady state of the 2d euler equation .",
    "the steady state that is selected is non - universal .",
    "it is determined by the dynamics in a non - trivial manner ( we have to solve a dynamical equation ) .",
    "interestingly , the equation for the coarse - grained vorticity obtained from the mepp turns out to coincide with a particular case of equations obtained by sadourny and basdevant ( 1981 ) with the anticipated vorticity method .",
    "our approach therefore reveals an interesting connection between the anticipated vorticity method and the mepp when the energy conservation is treated locally .",
    "two - dimensional incompressible and inviscid flows are described by the 2d euler - poisson system @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vorticity and @xmath7 the streamfunction .",
    "they are related to the velocity field @xmath8 by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a unit vector normal to the flow .",
    "starting from a generically unsteady or unstable initial condition , the 2d euler - poisson system is known to undergo a complicated mixing process .",
    "the vorticity @xmath12 develops a filamentation at smaller and smaller scales and never reaches a steady state .",
    "however , if we locally average over these filaments , the resulting coarse - grained vorticity @xmath1 is expected to reach a quasistationary state ( qss ) .",
    "this is known as weak convergence in mathematics .",
    "this qss , which is a particular steady state of the 2d euler equation , usually has the form of a large - scale vortex or a jet .",
    "a nice illustration of this mixing process is given by sommeria _",
    "et al _ ( 1991 ) in connection to the nonlinear development of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in a shear layer .    in order to predict the structure of these qsss as a function of the initial condition , miller ( 1990 ) and robert and sommeria ( 1991 )",
    "have proposed a statistical theory of the 2d euler equation .",
    "the key idea is to replace the deterministic description of the flow @xmath12 by a probabilistic description where @xmath13 gives the probability density of finding the vorticity level @xmath14 in @xmath15 at time @xmath16 .",
    "it satisfies the normalization condition @xmath17 . the observed ( coarse - grained ) vorticity field",
    "is then expressed as @xmath18 .    to apply the statistical theory",
    ", we first have to specify the constraints .",
    "the 2d euler equation conserves the energy @xmath19 and the fine - grained vorticity distribution @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total area occupied by the vorticity level @xmath22 .",
    "this is equivalent to the conservation of the casimirs @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an arbitrary function of the vorticity .",
    "the basic object of the statistical theory is the mixing entropy @xmath25=-\\int \\rho({\\bf r},\\sigma)\\ln \\rho({\\bf r},\\sigma ) \\ , d{\\bf r}d\\sigma\\ ] ] which counts the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate ( robert and sommeria 1991 , chavanis 2002 ) .",
    "the statistical equilibrium state of the 2d euler equation , which corresponds to the most probable state ( i.e. the macrostate that is the most represented at the microscopic level ) , is obtained by maximizing the mixing entropy ( [ mrs6 ] ) while respecting the normalization condition @xmath17 and conserving all the inviscid invariants of the 2d euler equation . if the evolution is ergodic , or at least if mixing is efficient enough , the system will evolve towards the statistical equilibrium state of the 2d euler equation .",
    "it is determined by the maximization problem @xmath26\\quad | \\quad e[\\overline{\\omega}]=e , \\quad \\int\\rho({\\bf r},\\sigma)\\ , d{\\bf r}=\\gamma(\\sigma ) , \\quad \\int \\rho \\ , d\\sigma=1\\rbrace.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical points of the mixing entropy at fixed @xmath27 , @xmath21 and normalization are obtained from the variational principle @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( inverse temperature ) , @xmath21 ( chemical potential ) and @xmath30 are appropriate lagrange multipliers .",
    "this leads to the equilibrium distribution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normalization factor .",
    "the coarse - grained vorticity is then given by @xmath33 differentiating equation ( [ mrs10 ] ) with respect to @xmath7 , it is easy to show that the local centered variance of the vorticity distribution @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 this relation is reminiscent of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in statistical mechanics . since @xmath36 , the statistical theory predicts that the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath37 is a stationary solution of the 2d euler equation . on the other hand , since @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the @xmath40 relationship is a monotonic function that is increasing at negative temperatures @xmath41 and decreasing at positive temperatures @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the statistical theory predicts that the qss ( assumed to be the most mixed state ) is characterized by a monotonic @xmath43 relationship .",
    "this @xmath40 relationship can take different shapes depending on the initial condition . substituting equation ( [ mrs10 ] ) in the poisson equation ( [ mrs1]-b )",
    ", the statistical equilibrium state is obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath44 with adequate boundary conditions , and relating the lagrange multipliers @xmath29 and @xmath45 to the constraints @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",
    "we also have to make sure that the distribution ( [ mrs9 ] ) is a ( local ) maximum of entropy , not a minimum or a saddle point .",
    "the moments of the fine - grained vorticity @xmath46 are conserved since they are particular casimirs .",
    "the first moment is the circulation @xmath47 and the second moment is the fine - grained enstrophy @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "the moments of the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath50 are _ not _ conserved since @xmath51 ( part of the coarse - grained moments goes into fine - grained fluctuations ) .",
    "for example , using the schwarz inequality , we find that @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the enstrophy calculated with the coarse - grained vorticity is always smaller than its initial value while the enstrophy calculated with the fine - grained vorticity is conserved .",
    "therefore , the notion of coarse - graining explains how we can have a decrease of enstrophy in a purely inviscid theory .",
    "by contrast , the circulation and the energy calculated with the coarse - grained vorticity are approximately conserved .",
    "for that reason , the energy and the circulation are called robust invariants while the moments of the vorticity of order @xmath49 are called fragile invariants .",
    "these results may be viewed as a form of inviscid selective decay due to coarse - graining ( not to viscosity ) .",
    "we introduce a family of functionals of the coarse - grained vorticity of the form @xmath53=-\\int c(\\overline{\\omega})\\ , d{\\bf r},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is any convex function ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "it can be shown that these functionals increase with time ( due to mixing ) in the sense that @xmath56 for any @xmath57 .",
    "for that reason they are sometimes called `` generalized @xmath0-functions '' ( tremaine _ et al _ 1986 , appendix a of chavanis 2006 ) or `` generalized entropies '' ( chavanis 2003 ) . however , ( i ) a monotonic increase of @xmath58 ( i.e. an @xmath0-theorem ) and ( ii ) the relaxation of the system towards a maximum of one of these functionals @xmath59 are _ not _ implied by this theorem ( although these properties may be expected in generic situations ) .",
    "we note that the neg - enstrophy ( the opposite of the enstrophy @xmath60 ) is a particular case of such functionals .",
    "for that reason , the functionals @xmath61 are sometimes called `` generalized enstrophies '' .",
    "let us decompose the vorticity @xmath6 and the velocity @xmath8 into a mean and a fluctuating part , namely @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "taking the local average of the euler equation ( [ mrs1]-a ) , we get @xmath64 where the vorticity current @xmath65 represents the correlations of the fine - grained fluctuations . equation ( [ mepp1 ] ) can be viewed as a local conservation law for the circulation @xmath66 . in order to conserve all the casimirs",
    ", we need to consider not only the locally averaged vorticity field @xmath67 but the whole probability distribution @xmath68 now evolving with time @xmath16 .",
    "the conservation of the global vorticity distribution @xmath69 can be written in the local form as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ( unknown ) current associated with the vorticity level @xmath22 .",
    "integrating equation ( [ mepp2 ] ) over all the vorticity levels @xmath22 , we find the constraint @xmath72 .",
    "this accounts for the conservation of the normalization condition @xmath73 .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ mepp2 ] ) by @xmath22 and integrating over all the vorticity levels , we get @xmath74",
    ".    we can express the time variation of energy in terms of @xmath75 , using equations ( [ mrs3 ] ) and ( [ mepp1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the constraint @xmath76 using equations ( [ mrs6 ] ) and ( [ mepp2 ] ) , we similarly express the rate of entropy production as @xmath77    the maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) consists in choosing the current @xmath78 which maximizes the rate of entropy production @xmath79 respecting the constraints @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the last constraint expresses a bound ( unknown ) on the value of the diffusion current .",
    "convexity arguments justify that this bound is always reached so that the inequality can be replaced by an equality .",
    "the corresponding condition on first variations can be written at each time @xmath16 : @xmath83 where @xmath4 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are lagrange multipliers , and leads to a current of the form @xmath86 the lagrange multiplier @xmath87 has been eliminated , using the condition @xmath81 of local normalization conservation .",
    "the vorticity current is @xmath88 the thermodynamical parametrization proposed by robert and sommeria ( 1992 ) can therefore be written as ( for simplicity we do not write the bar on @xmath8 ) : @xmath89 the equation for the coarse - grained vorticity is @xmath90 we note that this equation is not closed since it depends on the local centered enstrophy @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore have to solve equation ( [ mepp8 ] ) for all the levels or write an infinite hierarchy of equations for the moments @xmath92 ( robert and rosier 1997 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the lagrange multiplier @xmath4 is determined by introducing equation ( [ mepp7 ] ) in the constraint ( [ mepp3 ] ) .",

    "subtracting the foregoing equations , we obtain @xmath102 , which is immediately integrated into equation ( [ mrs9 ] ) where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 being a constant of integration",
    ". therefore , the mixing entropy ( [ mrs6 ] ) increases monotonically until the distribution ( [ mrs9 ] ) is reached , with @xmath106 .",
    "it can be shown that a stationary solution of the relaxation equation ( [ mepp8 ] ) is linearly stable if , and only if , it is an entropy _ maximum _ at fixed energy and casimirs .",
    "therefore , this numerical algorithm selects the maxima ( and not the minima or the saddle points ) among all the critical points of entropy .",
    "when several entropy maxima subsist for the same values of the constraints , the choice of equilibrium depends on a complicated notion of `` basin of attraction '' and not simply whether the solution is a local or a global entropy maximum .    in summary ,",

    "the generalized enstrophies ( [ g2 ] ) are not conserved but it does not seem possible to prove whether they decay monotonically or not ( actually , there is no fundamental reason why they should decay monotonically in an inviscid theory ) .    the vorticity current in the relaxation equation ( [ mepp9 ] ) is the sum of two terms .",

    "if we view these individual structures as maximum entropy states , there is no reason why they should all have the same temperature , angular velocity , and linear impulse .",
    "in addition , in order to determine @xmath4 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 in the parametrization ( [ mepp8 ] ) we have to integrate over the whole domain while the physics of the problem should be more local , even though the interaction is long - range . for example , to describe the formation of a large cyclone over a part of the world , it should not be necessary to perform an integral over the whole sphere ( the earth ) as implied by equation ( [ mepp10 ] ) . to solve these problems , chavanis and sommeria ( 1997 )",
    "have proposed a set of relaxation equations that preserve the galilean invariance of the 2d euler equation and that satisfy the conservation of energy , angular momentum and linear impulse locally thanks to diffusion currents .",
    "these equations relax towards individual coherent structures that correspond to statistical equilibrium states ( [ mrs9 ] ) having _ different _ values of temperature , angular velocity , and linear impulse .",
    "they may be interpreted as `` maximum entropy bubbles '' ( chavanis and sommeria 1998 ) . for the moment , this parametrization has never been used in practice .",
    "one difficulty is that we have to consider a large number of coupled equations for each level @xmath22 or an infinite hierarchy of equations for the vorticity moments @xmath129 ( a difficulty inherent to the statistical theory of 2d turbulence ) . in the present paper , we have considered a different approach .",
    "we have used the mepp with a local conservation of energy equal to zero , i.e. we impose @xmath179 instead of @xmath180 with @xmath181 . ] and derived the parametrization ( [ l5])-([l6 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that this parametrization is equivalent to a special case ( [ av1 ] ) of the parametrization of sadourny and basdevant ( 1981 ) based on the anticipated vorticity method , although the equations appear in a different form [ compare equations ( [ l6 ] ) and ( [ av1 ] ) ] .",
    "the new form of equation ( [ l6 ] ) derived in the present paper has a more physical interpretation than the form ( [ av1 ] ) ( see section [ sec_selective ] ) .",
    "an advantage of this parametrization over the parameterizations of robert and sommeria ( 1992 ) and chavanis and sommeria ( 1997 ) is that it yields a closed equation for the coarse - grained vorticity @xmath1 instead of an infinite hierarchy of equations for the vorticity moments @xmath129 .",
    "however , it does not respect the conservation of angular momentum and linear impulse , nor the galilean invariance of the 2d euler equation .",
    "finally , it does not in general relax towards a maximum entropy state unlike the parameterizations of robert and sommeria ( 1992 ) and chavanis and sommeria ( 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , in the parametrization ( [ l6 ] ) or ( [ av1 ] ) the diffusion current vanishes for any steady state of the 2d euler equation .",
    "this may account for non - ergodicity or be a drawback of this parametrization . finally , the relaxation equation ( [ two1 ] ) of chavanis ( 2003 ) is somehow intermediate between these different parameterizations since it relaxes towards a special class of steady states of the 2d euler equations specified by a generalized entropy @xmath182 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this equation in order to conserve energy , angular momentum and linear impulse locally by making the _ ansatz _ @xmath170 $ ] in the parametrization of chavanis and sommeria ( 1997 ) . of course",
    ", it would be interesting to compare the efficiency of these different parameterizations through direct numerical simulations .",
    "we have shown a connection between the anticipated vorticity method of sadourny and basdevant ( 1981 ) and the maximum entropy production principle of robert and sommeria ( 1992 ) when the conservation of energy is treated locally ( instead of globally ) .",
    "this connection is new and is the main result of the paper .",
    "more than showing the relation between two known equations , we have derived from the mepp a new form of equation [ see equation ( [ l6 ] ) ] that turns out , after some algebraic manipulations , to coincide with a special case of the parametrization of sadourny and basdevant ( 1981 ) [ see equation ( [ av1 ] ) ] .",
    "the new form of equation ( [ l6 ] ) , which incorporates a diffusion term and a drift term , has a nice physical interpretation in terms of a selective decay principle .",
    "this gives a new light to both the mepp and the anticipated vorticity method .",
    "the equation for the coarse - grained velocity field is @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the pressure and @xmath75 the vorticity current . taking the curl of equation ( [ v1 ] ) and using the identity @xmath185 and the definition @xmath186 we recover equation ( [ mepp1 ] ) . in section [ sec_l ]",
    ", we have established that @xmath187 using the identity of vector analysis @xmath188 which reduces for a 2d incompressible flow to @xmath189 we obtain @xmath190 under this form , the drift is equivalent to a force directed along the velocity @xmath8 .",
    "it points in the same direction as the velocity when @xmath191 which corresponds to negative temperatures .",
    "it may therefore be interpreted as an anti - friction , or a forcing , that restores the conservation of energy dissipated by the diffusion term . using the equivalent expression @xmath192 of the vorticity current ( see section [ sec_av ] ) , we obtain @xmath193    _ remark : _ with the parametrization of [ sec_local ] , the turbulent terms in equations ( [ v3 ] ) and ( [ v5 ] ) are replaced by @xmath194 and @xmath195 respectively .",
    "chavanis and sommeria ( 2002 ) have developed a statistical theory of the shallow - water ( sw ) equations and they have derived a set of relaxation equations towards the statistical equilibrium state by using a mepp .",
    "this is a generalization of the parametrization ( [ mepp8 ] ) .",
    "the relaxation equations ( [ two1 ] ) and ( [ two2 ] ) have been generalized to the sw equations by chavanis and dubrulle ( 2006 ) .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to generalize the parametrization ( [ l5 ] ) to the sw equations .",
    "this leads to the following set of equations @xmath196",
    "@xmath197 @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202where @xmath203 is the potential vorticity and @xmath204 is the bernouilli function .",
    "the generalized entropies are @xmath205=-\\int c(\\overline{\\omega})h\\ , d{\\bf r}$ ] .",
    "if we apply the anticipated vorticity method of section [ sec_av ] , we get @xmath206 which is equivalent to equation ( [ sw5 ] ) .",
    "the equations derived in sections [ sec_l ] and [ sec_av ] conserve the energy locally , but they do not conserve the angular momentum . for the sake of completeness , using similar methods , we derive here an equation that conserves the angular momentum locally . however , this equation is of little practical interest since it does not conserve the energy can not be perpendicular to both @xmath207 and @xmath15 when these two vectors are not collinear . ] .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum @xmath208 leads to the global constraint @xmath209 . applying the mepp with the local constraint @xmath210 , and writing the variational problem in the form",
    "@xmath211 we obtain the optimal current @xmath212 the lagrange multiplier @xmath213 has been eliminated , using the condition @xmath214 of local normalization conservation .",
    "the vorticity current is @xmath215 the evolution of the lagrange multiplier @xmath133 is determined by introducing equation ( [ a3 ] ) in the local constraint @xmath210 .",
    "this yields @xmath216 implying @xmath217 finally , we obtain the equations @xmath218 and @xmath219 since the diffusion coefficient is unspecified , we can take @xmath220 to avoid dividing by zero when @xmath221 .",
    "proceeding as in section [ sec_l ] , we can show that equation ( [ a7 ] ) conserves the normalization , the casimirs , the angular momentum , and increases monotonically the mixing entropy .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ a8 ] ) dissipates all the generalized enstrophies monotonically .",
    "the vorticity current vanishes for any axisymmetric flow @xmath222 . starting from a non - axisymmetric initial condition , this equation is expected to reach a steady state of the 2d euler equation that is axisymmetric , but its precise form can not be determined _ a priori_. it depends on the dynamics and we have to solve equation ( [ a8 ] ) .    _",
    "remark : _ if we take @xmath223 and ignore the advection term , the solution of equation ( [ a8 ] ) is @xmath224 where the @xmath225 are determined by the initial condition @xmath226 .",
    "we find that @xmath227 for @xmath107 where @xmath228 .",
    "this is a trivial example which shows how the asymptotic state of equation ( [ a8 ] ) is selected .",
    "we can proceed as in section [ sec_av ] to obtain an equation conserving locally the angular momentum while dissipating monotonically all the generalized enstrophies .",
    "we assume that the angular momentum is conserved locally so that @xmath229 .",
    "this implies that @xmath230 where @xmath133 is an arbitrary function . substituting this relation in equation ( [ l9 ] )",
    "we get @xmath231 .",
    "if we take @xmath232 with @xmath136 , we obtain @xmath137 . finally , it is relevant to write @xmath233 where @xmath139 has the dimension of a diffusion coefficient",
    ". therefore @xmath234 . substituting this expression in equation ( [ mepp1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath235 this equation can also be written as @xmath236 since @xmath109 is unspecified , we can take @xmath237 in order to avoid dividing by zero when @xmath221 .",
    "this equation conserves locally the angular momentum and decreases monotonically all the generalized enstrophies .",
    "indeed @xmath238 the diffusion current vanishes for any axisymmetric flow @xmath222 .",
    "actually , equation ( [ a9 ] ) is equivalent to equation ( [ a8 ] ) derived from the mepp . in the present case , this is obvious in view of the last equality in equations ( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) but we can also show it by making the parallel with the calculations of section [ sec_av ] . combining the identity of vector analysis @xmath239 with the relation @xmath240",
