    "the physics of highly charged ions ( hci ) has long and rich history due to the role the ions play in studying laboratory and cosmic plasma .",
    "recently , the interest to the subject was further elevated due to proposals to use hci for exceptionally accurate atomic clock  @xcite and for laboratory search for possible time variation of the fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "the latter proposal suggests the use of hci with optical transitions between states of different configurations .",
    "the existence of such transitions is due to level crossing while moving from madelung to coulomb level ordering along an isoelectronic sequence with increasing nuclear charge @xmath2",
    "one of the main obstacles in the use of hci with optical transitions is absence of experimental data on the spectra of the ions .",
    "theoretical calculations are also difficult just because of level crossing .",
    "level crossing means that the energy interval between states of different configurations is very small ( @xmath3 ) compared to the total ionization energy of valence electrons . as a result , the relative theoretical error in this interval is enhanced @xmath4 times .",
    "for example , different calculations give different ground states for sm@xmath1 , eu@xmath1 , etc .",
    ".    experimental study of the optical transitions is likely to have problems as well .",
    "all these transitions are very weak magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) or strongly suppressed electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions .",
    "this is because level crossing in hci happens mostly between @xmath5 and @xmath6 levels or @xmath7 and @xmath6 levels .",
    "the @xmath8 crossing happens for low ionization degree and there is no level crossing consistent with selection rules for electric dipole transitions . however , electric dipole optical transitions are still possible between many - valence - electron states of hci due to configuration mixing .",
    "these transitions are suppressed because leading configurations do not contribute to the amplitude and small admixture of appropriate configurations make the electric dipole transition possible . in this paper",
    "we suggest to employ dynamic stark shift of single known transition for recovering other optically accessible transitions .",
    "we consider optically accessible transitions in sm@xmath1 and sm@xmath0 ions .",
    "for these ions it is reasonable to consider m1 transitions between first and second exited states ( first exited state is metastable ) for sm@xmath0 and ground to first exited state transition in sm@xmath1 . if differential dynamic stark shift of such transitions in external laser field is measured for different frequencies of the light the information about ion spectra can be extracted .",
    "the value of the dynamic stark shift is determent by e1 or m1 transitions from these two states to other states .",
    "therefore , studying the dependence of the shift on frequency of the laser field can reveal the positions of theses other states .",
    "it is important that in contrast to direct scanning we do nt have to come close to the resonance while its position can be found with very high accuracy .",
    "this may have significant advantage in searching for weak transitions in considered hci .",
    "the results of calculations presented in this paper rely on method described in details in @xcite . a brief description of this method is presented below .",
    "we use the @xmath9 approximation  @xcite .",

    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are operator of momentum and coordinate of electron , @xmath9 is the self - consistent hf potential .    the configuration interaction method combined with the many - body perturbation theory (",
    "the ci+mbpt method  @xcite is used to construct the many - electron states for valence electrons .",
    "the effective ci hamiltonian has the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the single - electron operator and @xmath18 is the two - electron operator .",
    "the single electron operator @xmath19 differs from ( [ hf ] ) by an extra operator @xmath20 @xmath21 this @xmath22 operator represents the correlation interaction between a particular valence electron and electrons in the core .",
    "the two electron part of ( [ h_eff ] ) is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 accounts for screening of coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core electrons .",
    "we calculate the @xmath22 and @xmath24 operators in the lowest , second order of the mbpt .",
    "the ci many - electron wave function is written in a form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are determinants made of single electron eigenfunctions of ( [ hf ] ) combined in a way to have appropriate value of total angular moment @xmath27 .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath28 and corresponding energies are found by solving the matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath29 for lowest states of definite @xmath27 and parity .",
    "electric dipole transition amplitudes are calculated using the time - dependent hartree - fock method  @xcite ( equivalent to the well - known random - phase approximation ) and the ci technique @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-component of the dipole moment operator and @xmath33 is the correction to core potential due to its polarization by external electric field .",
    "electron wavefunctions @xmath34 and @xmath35 were obtained using the ci+mbpt techniques described in previous section .",
    "dynamic stark shift is considered in the appendix . for our analysis",
    "we need scalar polarizability given by ( [ 1pol ] ) .",
    "its calculation involves summation over complete set of intermediate many - electron states .",
    "we use the dalgarno - lewis method  @xcite to reduce this summation to solving a system of linear equations with the ci matrix .",

    "<S> transition amplitudes and energies within optical range for states that contribute to the polarizability of the mentioned transition are presented . employing simple analytical formula for polarizability data in the vicinity of a resonance and assuming that several values of the polarizability for different laser frequencies will be measured one can find the accurate position of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> results of similar calculations of amplitudes and energies of states that contribute to the polarizability of the m1 transition between ground and first excited states of sm@xmath0 are also presented . </S>"
