    "<S> the body of work performed with the aim of grasping the implications that critical changes in the ground state of a given hamiltonian model have for the sharing of entanglement by the parties of a quantum many - body systems is now quite substantial  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has resulted in important progresses made in our understanding of the interplay between critical phenomena of interacting many - body systems and the setting up of genuinely quantum features . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , such success has proven the effectiveness of the cross - fertilization of quantum statistical mechanics by techniques and interpretations that are typical of quantum information theory .    </S>",
    "<S> yet , it has recently emerged that the way correlations of non - classical nature manifest themselves is not necessarily coincident with entanglement , and a much broader definition of quantum correlations should be given  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is encompassed very effectively in the formulation of so - called quantum discord as a measure striving to capture the above - mentioned broadness of quantum correlations  @xcite . in analogy with the case of entanglement , </S>",
    "<S> the relation between quantum discord and the features of quantum many - body models is fundamentally interesting for the understanding of the role that the settlement of quantumness of correlations play in determining the critical properties of such models . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic analysis in this sense , which has only recently been considered  @xcite , is thus highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> this is even more important given that some of the investigations performed so far have indicated that quantum discord is more sensible than entanglement in revealing quantum critical points  @xcite , even for systems that are not at zero temperature  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this is a particularly relevant result , whose validity should also be checked for models that are both finite sized and at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the motivations for such an endeavor stem from the fact that , likely , the properties of quantum many - body systems will be addressed experimentally in systems consisting of , for instance , cold atoms loaded in optical potentials or trapped ions , as in very recent ground - breaking experiments  @xcite . at variance , the studies performed so far have mostly dealt with systems at the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , intuitively , one would expect global measures of general quantum correlations to be well suited to reveal the subtle features at hand here , given that some of the critical changes occurring in the lowest - energy state of many - body systems truly involve ( quasi-)long - range influences among the parties . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis is made very difficult , both at a theoretical and computational levels , by the lack of unambiguous measures of multipartite entanglement in mixed states .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the relation between criticality and global quantum correlations in finite - size systems at non - zero temperature by using a measure of global quantum correlations recently put forward in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and employed by some of us in  @xcite for a quantum many - body system at zero temperature . as canonical examples , we study one - dimensional models that are of genuine physical interest due to the non - trivial features of their phase diagrams , such as the transverse - field ising model , the open - boundary xx model in transverse magnetic field  @xcite , and the so - called cluster - ising model introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter interpolates between the standard antiferromagnetic ising hamiltonian and a topologically ordered _ cluster </S>",
    "<S> _ phase . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows the ability of global discord to detect critical points . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for specific cases among the examples addressed in our work , we bring evidence of a finite - size scaling for global discord and its derivative that are closely related to the behavior of macroscopic features such as the magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tools ] , we start our study by introducing both quantum discord and its global version . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ results ] we then move to the description of a set of physically relevant interacting quantum many - body models that will be studied against the content of global quantum correlations of equilibrium states at temperature @xmath0 and present our results . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we draw up our conclusions and discuss a few open questions that are left to a future addressing . </S>"
