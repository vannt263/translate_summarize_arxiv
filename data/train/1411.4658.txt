    "this apparent violation of the hawking area theorem can be explained by concluding that the energy flux out of the black hole is accompanied by an energy flux into the black hole across its horizon .",
    "this can happen because the polarization of the vacuum under the influence of the gravitational field can increase or decrease the local energy density of the zero - point fluctuations .",
    "the expectation value of the scalar field @xmath2 , also called the vacuum polarization of the field , encodes much of the information on these quantum fluctuations .",
    "computations of @xmath2 are a valuable tool in quantum field theory in curved spacetime , not only on their own regard as a measure of field fluctuations , but also as a tool for studying symmetry breaking effects and as a preliminary step in investigations of the stress - energy tensor and the casimir effect .",
    "candelas studied the effect of vacuum polarization on a scalar field in the schwarzschild black hole background @xcite and was able to calculate an analytical expression for @xmath3 at the horizon .",
    "candelas methods extend easily to charged static black holes , but the case of the rotating black hole is much more challenging ; frolov @xcite was able to calculate the analytical expression for @xmath3 only at the pole of the event horizon .",
    "there have also been numerical investigations of @xmath2 on general static black hole backgrounds beyond the event horizon ( e.g. @xcite for asymptotically flat solutions and @xcite for the asymptotically anti - de sitter case ) , and analytical computations at the horizon of a black hole threaded with a cosmic string @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will focus on the vacuum polarization of the massless minimally coupled scalar field for subtracted geometry black hole backgrounds .",
    "subtracted geometry black holes are solutions of the bosonic sector of n=2 stu supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets .",
    "they are obtained when one subtracts certain terms from the warp factor of the general black holes @xcite .",
    "this subtraction procedure when applied to the `` original '' n=2 stu black holes @xcite modifies their `` warp factor '' in such a way that wave equation becomes separable .",
    "the metric , however , remains a solution of the stu equations of motion .",
    "the subtracted metric can also be obtained from the original one through a scaling limit @xcite , or through a continuously interpolating procedure using a solution - generating transformation @xcite .",
    "the subtracted geometry is asymptotically conical instead of being asymptotically flat .",
    "the subtracted black holes also display a lifhshitz - like symmetry at the boundary and may be interpreted as being confined in an asymptotically conical box .",
    "the modified black holes have the same horizon area and periodicity of the angular and time co - ordinates as the original black holes .",
    "the subtracted black hole geometry is a good approximation to the original one from the horizon to within the radius of the circular photon orbits of the original black holes .",
    "quantum effects on curved spacetime , nevertheless , are often sensitive to non - local aspects of the geometry , and thus it is worth investigating whether the vacuum polarization at the horizon in the subtracted black holes is similar to the original values , or significantly different from them .",
    "differences in quantum effects between original and subtracted black holes were already found in @xcite for the horizon entanglement entropy at the subleading order .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will introduce our notation for describing both the original black holes and their subtracted counterparts . in section 3",
    "we will calculate the analytical expressions for @xmath2 for subtracted geometry black holes and compare it to the previously known value of the original black holes . in the static case",
    "we will calculate the vacuum expectation value at the horizon ; for the rotating case we will calculate the value only at the pole of the horizon . here we will also show that the values of @xmath2 in the original and subtracted geometries are related by the scaling limit mentioned above .",
    "we will also dedicate special discussion to the case of extremal black holes , showing that the original and subtracted results coincide for extremal static black holes ( bps limit ) but not for extremal rotating black holes . in section 4 we will calculate the vacuum expectation value for the interpolating solution from the original black hole to the subtracted limit obtained through the solution - generating transformations .",
    "section 5 contains the summary and discussion . in appendix",
    "a we give the full expression for the green s functions of the subtracted geometry black holes valid outside the horizon , which may be useful in later studies of , e.g. , the vacuum stress - energy tensor and the self force problem .",

    "the matter sources for these black holes solutions are given in @xcite .",
    "the subtracted geometry is defined by the replacement of the function @xmath23 by @xmath24 @xcite , given by :    @xmath25    the different scaling of @xmath9 at @xmath26 ( namely , the dominant terms being @xmath27 instead of @xmath28 ) is what makes the subtracted geometry asymptotically lifhshitz - like instead of asymptotically flat .",
    "the subtracted metric is a solution of the bosonic sector four - dimensional @xmath29 supergravity coupled to three vector supermultiplets .",
    "we will not require for our current purposes the detailed form of matter fields supporting the geometry , which are given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that one can obtain the subtracted geometry through a scaling limit , making in the original black hole metric the redefinitions @xmath30 and taking the @xmath31 limit .    in both the original and the subtracted case",

    "there are no existing analytic tools for computing the vacuum polarization on the entire horizon of rotating black holes",
    ". therefore we will restrict our attention to the general static case , and to @xmath41 at the pole ( @xmath42 ) of the horizon of rotating black holes .",
    "the vacuum polarization for the original schwarzschild and ( at the pole ) kerr - newman black holes have been computed in @xcite .",
    "we will add to these pre - existing computations the original four - charge black hole , and compare all the results with the corresponding subtracted cases .",
    "all our calculations will assume a massless , minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the algorithm for computing the vacuum polarization @xmath41 of a scalar field in a thermal state on a curved background is simple in principle , and is composed of two steps .",
    "the first one is to compute the euclidean green s function @xmath43 , by solving the wave equation on the wick - rotated euclidean manifold with the time periodicity corresponding to the temperature of the field .",
    "the second one is to take the coincidence limit of the green function , regularizing the uv divergences by subtracting appropriate counterterms which depend on the geodesic distance @xmath44 . in our case",
    "we will always implement radial separation , setting @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 in the rotating case ) and @xmath49 .",
    "the wave equation for the euclidean green s function , after wick rotating @xmath50 , is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a convenient rescaled radial variable , and @xmath53 is the determinant of the original metric ( [ metric4d ] ) . for",
    "subtracted geometry , the solution in the general rotating case is expanded as : @xmath54 in the original case the expansion involves lam functions instead of the legendre functions @xmath55 . in the general static case we may , by symmetry ,",
    "omit the sum over the magnetic quantum number @xmath56 ( not to be confused with the black hole mass parameter ) and write directly : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angle between the two points .",
    "expansion ( [ expansionst ] ) is valid in the general static case ( both original and subtracted ) .",
    "the radial wave equation that @xmath59 or @xmath60 satisfy is not solvable in closed form for the original black holes . for subtracted black holes there",
    "exist closed - form solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions , which we provide in the appendix .",
    "it turns out that in both the subtracted and original cases , the radial green s function with one point at the horizon vanishes except when @xmath61 ( static case ) or @xmath62 ( rotating case ) .",
    "therefore we only need @xmath60 and @xmath63 , which are the same in all cases : @xmath64\\,,\\ ] ] here @xmath65 are the legendre polynomials and the legendre functions of the second kinds respectively , and @xmath66 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the external horizon @xmath67 is at @xmath68 .",
    "it follows that in the general static case we have : @xmath69 and in the rotating case we have : @xmath70 where @xmath71 ; the latter expression clearly reduces to the former one for @xmath39 .",
    "the sums are evaluated using the heine identity @xcite : @xmath72 therefore in the general static case we have : @xmath73 and the same expression holds for @xmath42 in the general rotating case .",
    "thus the results of candelas and frolov @xcite for the green function on schwarzschild and kerr - newman generalize to black holes with four charges and with or without subtracted geometry .",
    "the vacuum polarization is given by the limit : @xmath74\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+ } \\left [ \\frac{\\kappa}{8\\pi^2\\,\\epsilon } -\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 \\sigma}-\\frac{1}{96\\pi^2}\\frac{r_{ab}\\,\\sigma^{,a}\\sigma^{,b}}{\\sigma}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is half of the geodesic distance squared between the points @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( with @xmath42 in the rotating case ) .",
    "the two counterterms are the non - vanishing parts of the hadamard expansion of the green s function @xcite .",
    "it is seen that even though the green s function term for subtracted black holes matches the non - subtracted one , the vacuum polarizations in both cases will not coincide .",
    "this is because the counterterms that need to be subtracted from @xmath78 have nontrivial dependence on the warp factor at the subleading order that survives the cancelation of divergences .",
    "for example , the second counterterm vanishes in vacuum solutions like the original schwarzschild and kerr black holes , yet it does not vanish for any of the subtracted black holes .",
    "the sum of the two counterterms in ( [ vacpollimit ] ) must be computed up to order @xmath79 in an expansion in powers of @xmath80 . to achieve this , we write the geodesic distance as :    @xmath81    in the rotating case , the integral",
    "is computed by evaluating the metric function @xmath9 at arbitrary @xmath82 setting @xmath42 at the end of the calculation . even though the integral can not in general be computed in closed form , it is possible to expand the integrand in order to compute @xmath83 accurately to the required order in @xmath80 .",
    "once we have obtained @xmath84 , we can easily compute the second counterterm @xmath85 by using the fact that for radial separation , both in the static case and at the pole in the rotating case , @xmath86 is the only nonvanishing component of @xmath87 and we have @xmath88    the preceding collection of formulas make straightforward the computation of @xmath89 in the general case .",
    "the result may be succinctly expressed as : @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the intrinsic curvature of the horizon ( its gaussian curvature as a two - dimensional surface , evaluated at the pole in the rotating case ) .",

    "term appears with the opposite sign here than in ( [ vacpollimit ] ) ; this is because the finite part of the @xmath93 counterterm provides not only @xmath91 but also an additional contribution proportional to @xmath94 . ]",
    "we give below the results first for each of the non - subtracted black holes , and then for their subtracted counterparts .",
    "the vacuum polarization at the horizon for the general static four - charge original black hole is :    @xmath95    this result is novel , and reduces when @xmath21 and when @xmath38 to the previously known results for the vacuum polarization on the reissner - nordstrm and schwarzschild black holes @xcite : @xmath96    the result at the pole of the general four - charge rotating black hole is readily obtainable as well . because of its great length , we have included it in appendix b. in the limit @xmath21 , it reduces to the kerr - newman result first derived in @xcite : @xmath97 to verify the equality of this result with that of @xcite one must bear in mind that in our notation the standard mass and charge parameters become @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the vacuum polarization at the horizon for the general static four - charge subtracted black hole is : @xmath100 in the particular cases of subtracted reissner - nordstrm and subtracted schwarzschild we obtain : @xmath101    comparing with the corresponding results for non - subtracted black holes , we see that all the results for the horizon vacuum polarization on the static subtracted geometries differ from their original counterparts .",
    "however , the difference is quantitative and not qualitative .",
    "the sign of the result , and the general way it behaves as a function of the parameters , is generally unchanged .",
    "the vacuum polarization at the pole of the fully general four - charge rotating subtracted black hole is relatively simpler than its corresponding non - subtracted expression given in appendix b. it reads : @xmath102^{5/2}}\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & \\big[m\\ , a^2(\\pi_c-\\pi_s)\\left(r_0(\\pi_c^2-\\pi_s^2)-8m\\,\\pi_c\\,\\pi_s\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + 2m^3(\\pi_c+\\pi_s)\\left(2m(\\pi_c^2-\\pi_s^2)+r_0(\\pi_c^2+\\pi_s^2)\\right)-2a^4(\\pi_c-\\pi_s)^3\\big]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as before we use the notation @xmath103 . in the kerr - newman limit @xmath21",

    "these results reduce to the above formulas for static black holes when @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", the subtracted expression turns out to be significantly less simple than frolov s original result ( [ frolov ] ) .",
    "it also presents the qualitative difference of being positive for all values of the parameters , whereas the original result can be vanishing or negative .    to conclude this section",
    ", we remark that there exists an alternative derivation of the vacuum polarization for subtracted black holes . instead of redoing the calculation in ( [ vacpollimit ] ) for the new geometries",
    ", we can apply the scaling limit ( [ rescaling ] ) directly to the original black hole results of section 3.1 .",
    "we have confirmed that performing this transformation on @xmath108 in fact results in the expressions we gave in this section for @xmath109 .",
    "there is a limit in which the subtracted geometry and the original geometry coincide .",
    "this is the so - called bps limit , which consists in rescaling the parameters @xmath110 as follows : @xmath111 and taking the limit @xmath31 .",
    "it is easily seen that this limit results in @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the bps limit describes an extremal static four - charge black hole .",
    "when taking this limit directly on both our original and our subtracted results , we obtain , as expected , the same limiting value : @xmath116    the way the zero result in the extremal limit is achieved in the original black hole and the subtracted one , for the reissner - nordstrm case of all @xmath21 , is plotted in figure [ rnplot ] as a function of the ratio of physical charge ( @xmath117 ) to physical mass ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "we remark in passing that the bps limit does not make each term of the expression ( [ gaussian ] ) vanish separately ; rather , in the bps limit both terms are finite and of opposite value : @xmath119    it is tempting to interpret the vanishing of the vacuum polarization in the bps limit as related to the zero temperature of the extremal black hole and as evidence of the intrinsically thermal nature of the field fluctuations",
    ". however , this interpretation fails to account for the fact that for extremal rotating black holes the vacuum polarization does not vanish . setting @xmath120 results also in an extremal black hole with zero temperature , as can be seen from ( [ defhorizons ] ) and ( [ defkappa ] ) , both for original and subtracted black holes and for any value of @xmath121 .",
    "looking for simplicity just at the pure kerr case @xmath38 , the original vacuum polarization at the pole in this limit is given by @xmath122 and the corresponding subtracted value is given by @xmath123 that is , exactly opposite in sign .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this fact , which could be a mere numerical coincidence .",
    "the values of @xmath124 for both kinds of kerr black holes are not so simply related in the non - extremal case ; the original one exhibits a zero value for @xmath125 ( as first noted by frolov @xcite ) while the subtracted one never vanishes . as a function of the dimensionless variable @xmath126 , these results read : @xmath127 @xmath128^{5/2}}\\,.\\ ] ] these results are contrasted in figure [ kerrplot ] . the change in sign of @xmath129 tracks directly the change of sign of the intrinsic curvature @xmath91 of the near - extremal kerr event horizon that was first indicated by smarr @xcite .",
    "this is because for the original kerr black hole the second term of ( [ gaussian ] ) vanishes . in the subtracted geometry case ,",
    "both terms of ( [ gaussian ] ) contribute and the result is always positive .",
    "in this section we will use an interpolating member of the four - charge family of static black hole solutions to find a formula for the vacuum polarization that interpolates between the original black hole value , its subtracted geometry value , and its value in the bps limit ( which , as we have seen , is zero ) .",
    "stationary solutions of the stu supergravity theory are acted on by the group @xmath130 . in particular , the original ( asymptotically flat ) black holes",
    "may all be obtained by acting with a @xmath131 subset of solution - generating transformations acting on a neutral stationary black hole .",
    "these transformations are parametrized by four boosts @xmath121 and one may obtain asymptotically flat bps solutions in the limit @xmath132 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that acting on any of the original black holes with a different @xmath133 , parametrized by four @xmath134 with @xmath135 , one obtains again all the asymptotically flat original black holes .",
    "however , if any any of the @xmath134 parameters equals unity , we obtain further solutions which are not asymptotically flat . in particular , the subtracted geometries studied in these paper are obtained by setting all but one @xmath134 equal to unity .",
    "if all @xmath134 are set to unity , one obtains a robertson - bertotti - type solution , which coincide with the near - horizon geometries of the asymptotically flat bps black holes .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves in this paper to @xmath136-transformations acting within the subfamily of static black holes , because in this case the transformation linking an original black hole to its subtracted counterpart preserves the mass and charge parameter values along its orbit ,    the @xmath134 transformation only affects the warp factor @xmath9 in the black hole metric .",
    "the warp factor for a static black hole with mass @xmath56 and charges @xmath121 , as a function of the @xmath134 parameters , is given by @xmath137\\,\\\\ & \\equiv & \\prod_j\\left [ a_j r + 2m\\ , b_j\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the static black hole subtracted geometry is obtained by setting : @xmath140 and doing in addition a rescaling of the metric given by : @xmath141    the vacuum polarization of the interpolating four charge black holes is computed straightforwardly as before from ( [ vacpollimit ] ) by computing the geodesic distance , its derivative and the ricci tensor of the interpolating metrics .",
    "the result is written in general in the form :    @xmath142    where the dots indicate all the inequivalent terms obtained by permuting indices .",
    "it is easily checked that the above expression reduces to the original result in the correct limit , @xmath143 where the original result was given in ( [ 4qorig ] ) .",
    "since each @xmath144 vanishes when @xmath145 , the bps limit correctly obtains the vanishing result we discussed above : @xmath146 the value of @xmath147 in the subtracted geometry can be found by setting the @xmath136-parameters to the values ( [ subharrison ] ) , and then performing a rescaling corresponding to ( [ rescaling ] ) on the result , giving : @xmath148 it is verified that this expression agrees with ( [ result4qsub ] ) .",

    "we have focused our attention on two general subclasses : the original black holes , which are asymptotically flat ( and include the usual black holes of the kerr - newman family , in the limit where all charges coincide ) , and the subtracted black holes , which modify the warp factor of the metric ( changing it from ( [ delta0 ] ) to ( [ deltasub ] ) ) and are asymptotically lifhshitz .",
