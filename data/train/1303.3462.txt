    "the study of open quantum systems has recently become a very active field @xcite .",
    "the reasons are many , including the development of quantum information and computation @xcite , quantum optics and scattering systems @xcite . particularly in this latter case",
    "the fractal weyl law has been proposed .",
    "this law predicts the way in which the long - lived resonances of these systems grow as a function of @xmath0 . the fundamental ingredient is the classical invariant set , which in this kind of systems is the repeller , i.e. , the set of trajectories non - escaping in the past and in the future .",
    "in fact , this law says that the number of long - lived quasibound states is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the partial hausdorff dimension of the repeller @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature that has contributed to gain confidence on this conjecture by means of numerical tests conducted on many systems @xcite .",
    "however , open quantum maps have been the main tool in these studies , as they offer great simplicity in the calculations without losing much generality @xcite . for them ,",
    "the fractal weyl law predicts that the resonances grow as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the partial fractal dimension of the repeller .",
    "but if the way to open the system is nonprojective the available literature is very scarce .",
    "recently @xcite this situation has been analyzed for dissipative quantum operations that can be thought as a phase space contraction leading to dissipative dynamics @xcite . in that work",
    "a dissipative baker map has been studied , where all classical initial conditions asymptotically fall on a strange attractor .",
    "the quantum counterpart has been implemented by means of a noise superoperator written in terms of kraus operators @xcite .",
    "the number of long - lived resonances has been found to behave in a rather different way compared to the usual prediction of the fractal weyl law .",
    "in fact , this number grows as a power law in @xmath0 , but the exponent is mainly insensitive to the dimension of the fractal invariant set .    in this work",
    "we analyze this behavior in depth .",
    "we find the weyl law for the spectra of contractive noise . in order to explain its emergence and discrepancies with the usual fractal weyl law",
    ", we first follow the same steps than in the case of scattering systems ( i.e. , having a projective opening ) .",
    "this is done in terms of an initial classical distribution ( that in this case shrinks following the associated dissipation ) evolved up to the quantum to classical correspondence time @xmath5 , the ehrenfest time .",
    "we propose a theoretical expression for this time based on dynamical considerations and confirm its validity by means of the exploration of the classical phase space distributions and the eigenvectors of the contractive superoperator .",
    "however , this reasoning does not lead to a satisfactory explanation .",
    "we conjecture that the strong non - orthogonality of the right eigenvectors is the main reason behind this behavior .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we briefly describe the dissipative model that we have used and give the expression of the weyl law for the contractive baker map . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the numerical results are analyzed and we explore possible explanations for the emergence of the here obtained weyl law supported by studies of the phase space distributions and the properties of eigenvectors . finally , we give our conclusions in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite we have investigated the spectral behavior of the dissipative baker map , which is defined on the 2-torus @xmath6 x @xmath7 by @xmath8    besides contracting the torus in the @xmath9 direction by a @xmath10 factor , this map stretches the unit square by a factor of two in the @xmath11 direction , squeezes it by the same factor in the @xmath9 direction , and then stacks the right half onto the left one . as a result a strange attractor sets in after a few time steps regardless of the nature of the initial condition .    the first step to quantize it is to impose on any state",
    "@xmath12 periodic boundary conditions on the torus , for both the position and momentum representations .",
    "then , we take @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 . there is a finite dimension @xmath17 for the corresponding hilbert space and a discrete set of position and momentum eigenstates , which is given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , whose eigenvalues are @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "a discrete fourier transform , i.e. @xmath22 relates these sets .",
    "we take anti - symmetric boundary conditions , this meaning @xmath23 . for an even @xmath24-dimensional hilbert space",
    ", the quantum baker map is defined in the momentum representation as @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 a unitary matrix ( closed quantum baker map ) .",
    "we introduce dissipation by means of a non - unital quantum operation @xcite implemented by an @xmath27 kraus superoperator of the form : @xmath28 quantum operations act on the density matrix , @xmath29 denotes the place where this later must be inserted in order to implement the corresponding quantum operation . here",
    "@xmath30 are operators that induce transitions towards the momentum state @xmath31 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath32 has the same value as the dissipation parameter of the corresponding classical map .",
    "@xmath33 is a trace preserving ( @xmath34 ) and non - unital ( @xmath35 ) superoperator , which describes a process contracting phase space volume .",
    "the complete quantum dissipative dynamics is obtained by composing @xmath33 with the unitary map ( [ quantumbaker ] ) , @xmath36    in this work we have computed the eigenvalue spectrum of superoperoperator ( [ superoper ] ) for different values of the contraction parameter ( @xmath37 ) and of the dimension ( @xmath38 ) . for each case",
    "we have counted the number of complex eigenvalues @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) with a decay rate @xmath41 smaller than a given value @xmath42 .",
    "the data are collected in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] which displays the fraction of resonances @xmath43 as a function of @xmath10 , @xmath44 and the cut - off value @xmath42 ( in a wide range @xmath45 ) .     as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 are represented by means of up triangles ( in red ) , down triangles ( in black ) , dots ( in blue ) and squares ( in magenta ) , respectively . ]    by fitting these numerical results , we obtain a remarkably compact and simple expression :    @xmath49    the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for four different values of @xmath10 , are given in table [ tab : weyl ] . in the fourth column we display the semiclassical prediction @xmath52 , which will be analyzed in section [ sec3 ] .    .",
    "values of the fitted coefficients @xmath50 ( column two ) and @xmath51 ( column three ) for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "the fourth column displays the semiclassical prediction @xmath52 described in section [ sec3 ] . [ cols=\">,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these findings generalize the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "on the one hand they confirm the existence of a power law dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath44 with an exponent which , in a meaningful range of validity , is fairly insensitive to the value of the dissipation parameter @xmath54 . on the other hand , they hint ( within a precision of @xmath55 ) on a very simple dependence of the prefactor with both @xmath10 and the cut - off value @xmath42 .",
    "we will leave the analysis of this prefactor , which is in general believed to be system - dependent , for future work @xcite and concentrate in the following on the scaling of @xmath53 with @xmath44 .",
    "we will seek for an expression of @xmath51 , in order to determine to which extent this exponent can be related to the underlying classical dynamics . for this",
    "we will follow an approach analogous to the one used in the formulation of the fractal weyl law for chaotic maps with a projective opening @xcite and discuss its limitations in the case of a contractive noise .",
    "a heuristic formulation of the fractal weyl law for chaotic maps with a projective opening is based on the assumption that the number of long - lived resonances ( associated with the classical repeller ) scales as the volume of the evolved initial classical distribution up to the ehrenfest time , that is , the volume of a finite ( ehrenfest)time repeller @xcite .",
    "this volume can be calculated by a combination of two exponential laws that relate the probability to reside in the system ( non escaping trajectories ) and the quantum to classical correspondence .    in the case of a contractive noise the connection between the long - lived resonances and the structure of the classical invariant also exists . in particular we have verified in @xcite that the husimi representation of the projector corresponding to the eigenfunctions with slow escape rate concentrates on the phase space region corresponding to the classical strange attractor .",
    "it seems then natural to generalize the considerations usually applied to chaotic maps with a projective opening to the contractive case and investigate whether this scheme succeeds in accounting for the weyl law of eq.([newweyllaw ] ) .",
    "our starting point will be the following relation @xcite :    @xmath56    between the fraction of long - lived resonances and the volume of the attractor @xmath57 which shrinks exponentially until the ehrenfest time according to :    @xmath58    notice in eq.([propor ] ) the square ( instead of linear ) dependence on @xmath57 , which is due to the use of the superoperoperator formalism to model the contractive noise .",
    "the classical decay rate @xmath59 and the correspondence ( ehrenfest ) time @xmath5 are then the two main ingredients of this approach that should be evaluated",
    ".    the classical decay rate can be easily calculated by following the time evolution of a uniform distribution in phase space under the action of dissipation .",
    "it is straightforward to see that after t time steps the original distribution will occupy @xmath60 fringes in the @xmath11 direction , each fringe having a width @xmath61 . hence the total phase space area occupied by the distribution as a function of time is @xmath62 , and then the classical decay rate is given by @xmath63 .",
    "determination of the ehrenfest time is a more subtle issue",
    ". understood as the time at which the quantum and the classical descriptions differ , we can start our reasoning following the lines of what is done in the case of area preserving maps . in fact , there are two different ways to conceive this correspondence time .",
    "the first one is the time @xmath64 at which a given initial semiclassical distribution ( a coherent state of width @xmath65 , for instance ) spreads up to the border of the system along the unstable direction ( manifold ) .",
    "this time is related to the expansive lyapunov exponent @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 . on the other hand",
    ", the time @xmath68 is that corresponding to the initial distribution shrinking along the stable direction to a size of the order of the planck cell ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this time is related to the contractive lyapunov exponent @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 .",
    "of course , in the case of an area preserving map @xmath72 and both times coincide .",
    "however , under a contractive noise , our dissipative map gives @xmath73 while @xmath74 .",
    "hence , we propose the shortest @xmath75 as the global quantum to classical correspondence time for this map .    in order to verify this assumption ,",
    "we have numerically estimated the correspondence time .",
    "this can be accomplished quite easily by evaluating the overlap @xmath76 between the finite time classical attractor and the husimi distribution of a uniform initial state evolved up to the same time .",
    "if we exploit the fact that for the baker map the interesting features of the distribution ( namely its fractality ) are only in the @xmath9 coordinate we can notably simplify this task .",
    "in fact , we just calculate the norm of the evolved wavefunction , restricted to the region occupied by the classical distribution at any given time . as a result",
    "we have obtained fig .",
    "[ f2 ] where these overlaps are shown as a function of the map iterations .",
    "we have found that , besides small fluctuations and the lack of precision inherent to the discrete time steps of the map , the results confirm our theoretical prediction ( see vertical lines as a guide ) .",
    "( map iterations ) .",
    "upper panel corresponds to @xmath77 , lower panel to @xmath78 .",
    "results for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are represented with squares ( in black ) , dots ( in blue ) and up triangles ( in magenta ) , respectively .",
    "vertical lines show the corresponding theoretical values of @xmath68 for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "( full , dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) . ]    inserting the expressions of @xmath59 and @xmath68 in eq.([propor2 ] ) gives @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the fractal dimension of the classical attractor .",
    "the values of the semiclassical @xmath52 are listed in the fourth column of table [ tab : weyl ] , showing a dramatic discrepancy with the values obtained by fitting our numerical results with eq .",
    "( [ newweyllaw ] ) . besides an overall factor of @xmath84 between @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ", the semiclassical exponent shows a dependence on @xmath10 ( via the fractal dimension of the attractor ) which is absent in the fitted @xmath51 which are practically constant .",
    "then , it becomes clear that the way of reasoning that has provided with a reasonable explanation for the emergence of the usual fractal weyl law for systems subjected to projective noise can no longer be applied to contractive dynamics .",
    "we are now faced with the question of where this discrepancy comes from .    at the basis of eq.([propor ] ) is the assumption that the number of long - lived quantum states can be approximated by the number of planck cells which fit into the phase space volume of the classical invariant set .",
    "this , in turn , supposes that to a good approximation the eigenfunctions supported by this set are non - overlapping . even though we can not strictly speak of orthogonality , since the operators describing open systems are not normal , we know that in the case of projective openings the long - lived eigenfunctions are quasi - orthogonal ( while the short - lived ones present a high degree of degeneracy )",
    "this explains the success of the fractal weyl law in the projective case . in the case of contractive dynamics",
    "we will investigate this point by defining the overlap matrix @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are the right eigenstates corresponding to the superoperator @xmath87 of eq .",
    "( [ superoper ] ) ( this is not to be confused with the biorthogonality of the right and left eigenfunctions of a superoperator , which states that @xmath88 ) .",

    "[ f3 ] , respectively .",
    "a grayscale is used to represent them , going from white corresponding to value @xmath92 to black corresponding to the maximum values .",
    "we observe that the off - diagonal elements are clearly non negligible .",
    "moreover , their value grows with the contractive power of the corresponding map ( as @xmath10 decreases ) . for comparison",
    "we show in panel ( d ) the overlap matrix for a projective case , obtained by opening the baker map along two symmetric bands in the q - direction , of width @xmath93 and centered at @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in this case , as expected , the matrix is almost diagonal .     of the first @xmath91",

    "we have found an expression of the weyl law for the spectra of the contractive baker map .",
    "an analogous simple dependence on @xmath46 has also been obtained for a dissipative kicked top map on the sphere .",
    "we were not able to explain the emergence of this law by means of the usual line of reasoning applied to the projective case .",
    "very simply put , the idea is counting resonances .",
    "this has been traditionally accomplished by partitioning the phase space volume occupied by a finite time classical invariant set ( the repeller ) .",
    "in fact , implies a pseudo orthogonality of the long - lived eigenstates . we could verify that this is indeed the case for the projectively opened baker map , a system that has been paradigmatically used in the fractal weyl law literature .",
    "but when it comes to the dissipative baker map used in this work , we have clearly identified a high degree of non - orthogonality .",
    "this is the main reason behind the failure of the usual reasoning for explaining the emergence of the weyl law .    as a result",
    ", we think that a new method for counting the long - lived resonance other than just partitioning the corresponding volume in phase space into planck cells , is the key to understand the statistical behavior of contractive maps . in the future",
