    "sorting , or ordering of multivariate data is an important and challenging problem in many fields of computational science . since there is no canonical linear ordering for multivariate data ,",
    "many different notions of ordering have been proposed in the literature  @xcite , and the problem is very much application dependent .    in the context of multiobjective optimization ,",
    "ordering by dominance relations has achieved prominence .",
    "a general multiobjective optimization problem involves finding among a set of feasible solutions those that minimize a collection of objectives .",
    "one feasible solution is said to _ dominate _ another if it gives a smaller value for _ every _ objective .",
    "the collection of feasible solutions that are not dominated by any other solution are called _ pareto - optimal _ or _",
    "nondominated_. in the database community the pareto - optimal solutions are called the _ skyline _ of the dataset  @xcite .",
    "the notion of pareto - optimality is widely used in evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization  @xcite , such as the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ( nsga - ii )  @xcite , the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm ( spea )  @xcite , and the pareto envelope - based selection algorithm ( pesa )  @xcite , among many others ( see  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "central to many of these algorithms is the assignment of a fitness to each feasible solution based on sorting all the feasible solutions via dominance .",
    "the nsga - ii algorithm assigns its fitness level via _",
    "nondominated sorting _ , sometimes called _ pareto depth analysis _ ( pda ) , which arranges the feasible solutions into layers by repeatedly peeling off the pareto - optimal solutions .",
    "nondominated sorting has also found applications in gene selection and ranking  @xcite , anomaly detection  @xcite , and multiquery image retrieval  @xcite . as it turns out ,",
    "nondominated sorting is equivalent to the _ longest chain problem _ , which has a long history in combinatorics and probability  @xcite .    due to the wide use of nsga - ii",
    ", there has been significant interest in fast algorithms for nondominated sorting  @xcite .",
    "recently , calder et al .",
    "@xcite established a continuum limit for nondominated sorting that corresponds to solving a hamilton - jacobi partial differential equation ( hje ) .",
    "this result shows that there is a simple asymptotic structure underlying nondominated sorting , and this opens the door to extremely fast algorithms based on exploiting this structure .",
    "calder et al .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a sublinear algorithm for approximate nondominated sorting called _ pde - based ranking _ that is based on estimating the distribution of the data and solving the hje numerically .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we show how to use pde - based ranking to significantly improve the performance of algorithms that are based on nondominated sorting .",
    "to illustrate this in a concrete setting , we propose a new real - time version of the multi - criteria pda anomaly detection algorithm from  @xcite that uses pde - based ranking in place of nondominated sorting .",
    "the computational complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude ( from quadratic to linear ) , and this allows the model to be updated in real - time upon the acquisition of each additional data sample .",
    "we also prove in theorem [ thm : rate ] a convergence rate for the pde - based ranking continuum approximation .",
    "second , we present a new partial differential equation ( pde ) continuum limit for ordering solutions _ within _ the layers generated by nondominated sorting in two dimensions .",
    "this new continuum limit allows us to efficiently explore the tradeoff between multiple objectives . in the context of multi - criteria anomaly detection , we show how to use this pde continuum limit to classify anomalies based on which criterion is more significantly violated .",
    "we give a derivation of these new continuum limits and present a convergence analysis . in both cases , we trade exact algorithms of high computational complexity for fast approximate algorithms that are convergent , meaning that the error in the approximation goes to zero as the sample size grows .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prev ] we review the continuum limit for nondominated sorting from  @xcite , and present the pda multicriteria anomaly detection algorithm from @xcite . in section [ sec : new ] , we derive two new pde continuum limits for ordering points within pareto fronts , and fast upwind schemes for solving these pdes numerically . in section [ sec : algorithm ] , we present our fast pde - based anomaly detection and classification algorithm in the context of streaming data , and in section [ sec : numerics ] we present the results of numerical experiments for both real and synthetic data streams .",

    "hamilton - jacobi equations like generally do not admit classical solutions ( i.e. , continuously differentiable solutions ) due to the possibility of crossing characteristics .",
    "there are , however , infinitely many functions @xmath30 that are differentiable almost everywhere and satisfy at each point of differentiability .",
    "the notion of viscosity solution selects from among these infinitely many feasible solutions the one that is ` physically correct ' for a _ very _ wide range of problems . in this context , the viscosity solution is correct because it captures the continuum limit of the pareto depth function  @xcite .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the computational advantages of pde - based ranking , we consider a concrete application of nondominated sorting to anomaly detection  @xcite .",
    "anomaly detection refers to the problem of detecting patterns in data that deviate from the expected behavior .",
    "it is an important and challenging problem with a wide array of applications , including computer intrusion detection , video surveillance , credit card fraud , and biometrics  @xcite .",
    "many anomaly detection algorithms rely on the availability of a measure of distance ( or similarity ) between data samples , and look for anomalies by finding samples that are far from their nearest neighbors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these algorithms are usually called _ similarity - based _ , and are widely used due to their simplicity and robustness .    in contrast , feature - based algorithms seek to embed the data into a relatively low dimensional euclidean space and make use of the ambient euclidean ( or other ) distance to detect anomalies . techniques used for feature - based algorithms include support vector machines ( svm ) , clustering , neural networks , and statistical approaches based on density estimation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider _ similarity - based _ approaches .    in many applications ,",
    "multiple measures of similarity may be required to detect certain types of anomalies .",
    "for example , when tracking pedestrians in video surveillance , one criterion may correspond to differences in individual walking speeds , while another might correspond to differences in the shapes of trajectories . using multiple criteria",
    "allows one to detect a wider range of anomalies than could be obtained from a single criterion alone .",
    "hsiao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an algorithm for multi - criteria anomaly detection that integrates the information from multiple similarity measures via nondominated sorting ( or pareto depth analysis ( pda ) ) .",
    "suppose we have a training set consisting of @xmath39 objects @xmath40 and @xmath14 measures of similarity @xmath41 for comparing these objects .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume @xmath42a lower score indicates the objects are more similar with respect to the @xmath43 criteria .",
    "the training phase of the algorithm consists of computing the @xmath44 dyads @xmath45^d,\\ ] ] and constructing the pareto depth function @xmath46 by applying nondominated sorting to the @xmath3 points @xmath47 .",
    "recall that @xmath48 if and only if @xmath49 belongs to the @xmath10 pareto front .",
    "the testing phase of the algorithm receives a new object @xmath50 and compares it to all training samples to create @xmath39 new dyads @xmath51 given by @xmath52 fix a number @xmath53 , and let @xmath54 denote the indices of training samples that are among the @xmath53 nearest neighbors of @xmath50 with respect to at least one similarity measure @xmath55 .",
    "the anomaly score for @xmath50 is @xmath56 and @xmath50 is declared an anomaly when @xmath57 is larger than a predefined threshold @xmath58 .",
    "we note that it is possible to allow different values of @xmath53 for each criterion .",
    "the idea is that typical samples should be close to many of their nearest neighbors in one or many similarities , and thus the dyads @xmath51 will lie on earlier pareto fronts",
    ". an anomalous sample should be far from its nearest neighbors in many or all of the similarities , and the dyads will consequently fall on deeper fronts .",
    "the pda anomaly detection algorithm has been validated on real and synthetic data in @xcite and has been shown to achieve state of the art results for integrating information from multiple similarities .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hje ) continuum limit gives information about which pareto front a sample lies on .",
    "it is also important in applications to know where a sample lies within its pareto front , as this gives information about the trade - off between the multiple objectives .",
    "we present here some new pde continuum limits for ordering of points _ within _ pareto fronts in dimension two , and we present fast sweeping numerical schemes for solving the pde .",

    "the numerical solution @xmath79 is computed by sweeping the grid @xmath80 exactly once in the upwind direction @xmath81 .",
    "since each pareto front has in general a different number of points , the values of @xmath63 within different fronts are difficult to compare .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the following normalization : @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the pareto front that @xmath13 belongs to .",

    "we solve with an upwind scheme in the opposite direction : @xmath88 we present a convergence analysis for these new continuum limits in section [ sec : conv_anal ] of the appendix .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "each pde involves the solution of the previous pdes , so they must be solved in the order -- .",
    "we solve numerically using the first order accurate scheme presented in @xcite , which also has linear complexity .",
    "the transport pdes and are degenerate when @xmath89 , which can only happen when @xmath20 vanishes . to avoid this degeneracy , we numerically precondition the density by replacing @xmath20 with @xmath90 .",
    "we propose here a modification of the pda multicriteria anomaly detection algorithm  @xcite to the setting of online streaming data .",

    "we observe the data @xmath92 sequentially and must determine whether @xmath92 is an anomaly based only on the previous history @xmath93 .",
    "due to memory and computational constraints , it may not be feasible to use this entire history , especially when @xmath94 is large .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath95 and consider the windowed history @xmath96 we use the history @xmath97 as training data in order to determine whether @xmath92 is an anomaly . even without memory constraints ,",

    "if we use the pda anomaly detection algorithm with exact nondominated sorting , then we would need to store in memory all of the @xmath100 dyads corresponding to pairs from the history @xmath97 . since the addition of a single new sample can potentially affect the arrangement of _ all _ the pareto fronts , re - training the model when new samples are acquired requires applying nondominated sorting to _ all _ @xmath101 dyads , which has complexity slightly worse than @xmath101 for memory and operations .",

    "the training set consisted of 500 trajectories randomly drawn from a total of 1666 trajectories that day .",
    "the mean aucs of the pde - based and exact sorting based algorithms were @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively and the roc curves are shown in figure [ fig : pedestrian_traj](a ) .",
    "we observe very little difference between the exact sorting and the pde - approximations .",
    "we can not present quantitative results for anomaly classification in this setting as there is no ground truth labeled data available . along with some normal trajectories",
    ", we also plotted some anomalous trajectories with their respective classification scores in figure [ fig : pedestrian_traj](b , c ) .",
    "finally , we applied the pde - based streaming anomaly detection algorithm to a large portion of the pedestrian dataset , spanning over several days of data .",
    "figure [ fig : auc_pedestrian ] shows the auc as a function of artificial time for a simulated stream consisting of 15,000 trajectories with an initial training set of 400 randomly drawn trajectories .",
    "the small labeled portion of the dataset ( approx .",
    "1000 trajectories ) was used to generate the roc curves .",
    "in this paper , we showed how to use some recently discovered pde continuum limits for nondominated sorting to perform anomaly detection and classification in real - time in a streaming setting .",
    "the classification is performed using new pde continuum limits for ordering within the nondominated layers .",
    "we proved convergence rates for the continuum approximations and presented the results of numerical experiments with synthetic and real data that show our algorithm can adapt quickly and efficiently to a changing data stream .",
    "although we focused in this paper on the anomaly detection problem , the ideas are not restricted to this context .",
    "indeed , nondominated sorting is widely used in multiobjective optimization , and the ideas in this paper potentially apply to any such application , leaving many interesting problems for future work .",
    "we give here derivations of the new pde continuum limits presented in section [ sec : new ] .",
    "for ease of reference , we recall some of the definitions from the main paper here .",
    "suppose @xmath36 and let @xmath19 be a sequence of _ i.i.d . _  random variables with continuous density @xmath20 on @xmath59 .",
    "apply nondominated sorting to @xmath5 and then order the points within each pareto front by @xmath60-coordinate .",
    "this defines a function @xmath61 given by @xmath205 by the continuum limit of nondominated sorting ( theorem 1 ) , there are on the order of @xmath206 pareto fronts . since there are @xmath3 points in total , is is reasonable to conjecture that each front has on the order of @xmath206 points .",
    "therefore , we need to normalize @xmath63 by @xmath206 , and suppose that @xmath64 uniformly with probability one , where @xmath65 ^ 2 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] is continuously differentiable .    fix a large value of @xmath3 and consider a point @xmath207 .",
    "fix @xmath208 and let @xmath209 where @xmath210 . since @xmath211 is tangent to the level set @xmath212 , we have @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath214 and @xmath215 are roughly on the same pareto front",
    ". see figure [ fig : alongfronts ] for an illustration .",
    "let @xmath216 denote the rectangle whose diagonal is the line segment from @xmath214 to @xmath215 , and let @xmath217 denote the number of points on the pareto front passing through @xmath214 and @xmath215 that fall within @xmath216 .",
    "then we have @xmath218 here , @xmath219 denotes the gradient of @xmath220 .",
    "when @xmath208 is small , the random variables within @xmath216 are approximately uniformly distributed within @xmath216 .",
    "furthermore , as illustrated in figure [ fig : alongfronts ] , we can scale @xmath216 to the unit box @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] without changing the partial ordering within @xmath216 . hence , it is reasonable to conjecture that @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is a universal constant and @xmath223 is the number of samples falling in @xmath216 . while the value of @xmath224 is not needed for sorting ( since we perform a normalization in below ) , a simple scaling argument that we omit suggests that @xmath225 , so we will take @xmath226 . by the law of large numbers @xmath227 since the side lengths of @xmath216 are @xmath228 and @xmath229 . combining this with @xmath230 , and @xmath226 yields",
    "@xmath231 hence this simple heuristic argument suggests that @xmath220 satisfies the linear transport pde @xmath232    since each pareto front has in general a different number of points , the values of @xmath63 within different fronts are difficult to compare .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the following normalization : @xmath233 where @xmath83 denotes the pareto front that @xmath13 belongs to .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is an index between 0 and 1 that gives information about where the point @xmath13 falls within its pareto front .",
    "the heuristics above suggest that @xmath85 uniformly with probability one , where @xmath234 and @xmath235 is the inverse of @xmath236 . in other words",
    ", we are normalizing @xmath237 by the asymptotic number of points on the front to which @xmath214 belongs .",
    "the expression in is difficult to work with numerically .",
    "we will instead derive a pde for @xmath86 . differentiating yields @xmath238 take the dot product of both sides with @xmath211 and recall to find that @xmath239 since @xmath240 on @xmath241",
    ", @xmath86 can be characterized as the solution of the following transport pde @xmath242    on a slightly more technical note , since @xmath30 is not necessarily differentiable the velocity @xmath211 in the transport equations and is not well - defined . to make sense of these pde",
    "rigorously , we can instead write them in divergence form , since @xmath243 it is possible to prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of and in the sobolev space @xmath244 . such results are outside the scope of this paper , and we intend to pursue them in a future work .",
    "we also note the case of dimension @xmath141 is considerably more complicated , since there is no canonical linear ordering of the points within each front .",
    "if we instead consider ordering the points within fronts via nondominated sorting with respect to different partial orders , it is possible to derive similar continuum limits .",
    "however the pde are highly nonlinear and the analysis is significantly more difficult .",
    "we leave these considerations to future work .",
    "the derivations of the transport equations and are heuristic in nature .",
    "establishing these continuum limits rigorously is an important and challenging pde problem that we plan to pursue in the future . in the meantime , we present here a convergence analysis for the continuum limits and in the case that @xmath245 , i.e. , the samples are independent and uniformly distributed on the unit box @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] . in this case",
    "we can solve all three pdes , , and in closed form .",
    "we have @xmath246 we performed a convergence analysis by drawing @xmath34 independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] and computing @xmath63 and @xmath247 according to their definitions and , respectively .",
    "we measured the discrepancy with the continuum limits in the @xmath248 and @xmath249 norms , computed by @xmath250 and @xmath251 respectively .",
    "the definitions of @xmath252 and @xmath253 are similar .",
    "figure [ fig : conv ] shows the errors for a single realization and various values of @xmath3 ranging from @xmath254 to @xmath255 .",
    "each of the errors is observed to be converging to zero at a rate of @xmath256 where @xmath257 , except for @xmath252 . upon closer inspection ,",
    "the function @xmath258 is discontinuous at @xmath259 , hence uniform convergence is impossible .",
    "this discontinuity reflects the fact that near @xmath259 the pareto fronts cut off an infinitesimal portion of the top corner of the box , and hence @xmath247 transitions from @xmath260 to @xmath261 over an infinitesimally short distance .",
