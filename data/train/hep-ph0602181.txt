    "the hadronic nature of the photon is currently a subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the central question for hadronic interactions of real photons is whether they behave the same as hadrons or whether the additional hard contributions to the total cross sections of photon - induced interactions lead to a faster rise of the total @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections as a function of the energy .",
    "the increase of hadron - hadron total cross sections was theoretically predicted many years ago @xcite and this prediction has been accurately verified by experiment @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the total photoproduction cross sections @xmath8 at hera @xcite and the measurements of the total hadronic cross sections @xmath9 at lep @xcite have also established the increase of photon - hadron and photon - photon total cross sections .",
    "early modeling of these cross sections within regge theory shows a energy dependence similar to the ones of nucleon - nucleon @xcite .",
    "this universal behavior , appropriately scaled in order to take into account the differences between hadrons and the photon , can be understood as follows : at high center - of - mass energies the total photoproduction @xmath8 and the total hadronic cross section @xmath9 for the production of hadrons in the interaction of one and two real photons , respectively , are expected to be dominated by interactions where the photon has fluctuated into a hadronic state . therefore measuring the energy dependence of photon - induced processes should improve our understanding of the hadronic nature of the photon as well as the universal high energy behavior of total hadronic cross sections .",
    "however the comparison of the experimental data and the theoretical prediction , as discussed some time ago @xcite , may also present some subtleties depending on the monte carlo model used to analyze the data . despite the similar energy dependence of hadron - hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon total cross sections ,",
    "there are significant differences between photon induced cross section measurements and those of the purely hadronic processes .",
    "the latter comes from a counting rate @xmath10 , the number of counts / sec/@xmath11 in a narrow interval around the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath12 , extrapolated to the value @xmath13 and normalized by an appropriate factor ( for colliding beams this normalization factor is the luminosity @xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 cross sections are extracted from a measurement of hadron production in @xmath15 processes and are strongly dependent upon the acceptance corrections to be employed .",
    "these corrections are in turn sensitive to the monte carlo models used in the simulation of the different components of an event , and this general procedure produces uncertainties in the determination of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this clearly implies that any phenomenological analysis has to take properly into account the discrepancies among @xmath9 data obtained from different monte carlo generators .    a global description of photon - photon , photon - hadron and hadron - hadron total cross sections is possible by means of qcd - inspired eikonal models @xcite .",
    "in these models the increase of the total cross sections is associated with semihard scatterings of partons in the hadrons .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections is driven mainly by gluon - gluon scattering processes , since @xmath16 at small-@xmath17 values . nevertheless , the gluon - gluon subprocess cross section is potentially divergent at small transferred momenta , and the usual procedure to regulate this behavior is the introduction of a purely _ ad hoc _ parameter separating the perturbative from the non - perturbative qcd region , like an infrared mass scale @xcite , or a cut - off at low transverse momentum @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these arbitrary parameters are adjusted in order to obtain the best fits to the experimental data .",
    "recently we introduced a qcd - inspired eikonal model where the _ ad hoc _ infrared mass scale was substituted by a dynamical gluon mass one @xcite .",
    "one of the central advantages of the model is that it gives a precise physical meaning for the quoted infrared scale .",
    "furthermore , since the behavior of the running coupling constant is constrained by the value of dynamical gluon mass @xcite , the model also has a smaller number of parameters than similar models .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed study of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering in the framework of the qcd eikonal model with a gluon dynamical mass of ref .",
    "we address the question of derivating @xmath0 and @xmath1 total cross sections from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 forward amplitudes , exploring the process underlying the extraction of @xmath1 from the @xmath15 data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly review the qcd - inspired eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass . sec .",
    "iii contains the details of @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross - sections calculations .",
    "the results are presented in the sec .",
    "iv , where we provide fits for the cross sections , discuss the factorization theorem , @xmath4 , and investigate a possible mild dependence of the probability that the photon interacts as a hadron ( @xmath7 ) increases with the energy .",
    "the results are compared to the data handled with the pythia and phojet monte carlo generators .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the high - energy hadron - hadron cross sections are calculated using a recently developed qcd - inspired eikonal model , where the onset of the dominance of gluons in the interaction of high - energy hadrons is managed by the dynamical gluon mass scale @xcite .",
    "the model satisfies analyticity and unitarity constraints , and the hadron - hadron elastic scattering is due to the diffractive shadow of inelastic events . in the eikonal formalism the total cross section is given by @xmath19 , \\label{degt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the square of the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath21 is the impact parameter , and @xmath22 is a complex eikonal function . following the ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the even eikonal as the sum of gluon - gluon , quark - gluon , and quark - quark contributions : @xmath23 , \\label{final4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the overlap function at impact parameter space and @xmath26 are the elementary subprocess cross sections of colliding quarks and gluons ( @xmath27 ) . the overlap function , normalized so that @xmath28 , is associated with the fourier transform of a dipole form factor , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "the odd eikonal @xmath31 , that accounts for the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels , is parametrized as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dynamical gluon mass and the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants to be fitted .",
    "the factor @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 with the dynamical coupling constant @xmath38 set at its frozen infrared value .",
    "the origin of the dynamical gluon mass and the frozen coupling constant can be traced back to the early work of cornwall @xcite , and the formal expressions of these quantities can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    since that the main contribution to the asymptotic behavior of hadron - hadron total cross sections comes from gluon - gluon semihard collisions , the eikonal functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , needed to describe the lower - energy forward data , are simply parametrized with terms dictated by the regge phenomenology : @xmath41 @xmath42 \\ , w(b;\\sqrt{\\mu_{qq}\\mu_{gg } } ) , \\label{mdg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fitting parameters .    in the model the gluon eikonal term @xmath48 ( see the expression ( [ final4 ] ) )",
    "is written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50    here @xmath51 is the convoluted structure function for pair @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the subprocess cross section and @xmath54 is a fitting parameter . in the above expression",
    "it is introduced the energy threshold @xmath55 for the final state gluons , assuming that these are screened gluons @xcite . the structure function @xmath51 is given by @xmath56(\\tau)=\\int_{\\tau}^{1 } \\frac{dx}{x}\\ , g(x)\\ , g\\left ( \\frac{\\tau}{x}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the gluon distribution function , adopted as @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the correct analyticity properties of the model amplitudes is ensured by substituting @xmath61 throughout eqs .",
    "( [ mdg1 ] ) , ( [ mdg2 ] ) and ( [ sloh1 ] ) . other details of the model can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the fitting parameters are shown in table [ parameters ] , in the case of a dynamical gluon mass @xmath62 mev , which is the preferred value for @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering .",
    "the total cross section @xmath63 , the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath64 , and the nuclear slope @xmath65 for proton - proton and antiproton - proton collisions have been found to be well described by the qcd - inspired eikonal model discussed in the last section , which we shall refer simply as the dgm model .",
    "hence we fix the input parameters to the eikonal model calculations by using the data on @xmath2 and @xmath3 reactions in order to make predictions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 using the same values of the parameters .",
    "these values are shown in the table [ parameters ] .",
    "the fact that at high energies a photon can fluctuate itself into a hadronic state open many theoretical possibilities . for example , in the model of block _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the data on @xmath0 total photoproduction and the total hadronic @xmath1 cross sections can be derived from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 forward amplitudes using vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and the additive quark model .",
    "we verify that this procedure , valid for qcd inspired models with an arbitrary infrared scale , can also be applied to our eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass being necessary only minimal changes displayed in the sequence .",
    "thus , considering that a strongly interacting photon behaves as a system of two quarks ( the additive quark model ) , the even amplitude for @xmath0 scattering can be obtained after the substitutions @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the eikonal of eq .",
    "( [ final4 ] ) , resulting in the following expression : @xmath68 .",

    "_ @xcite the above procedure is used to obtain directly the physical eikonal @xmath69 , what means that the odd part of the eikonal that describes @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering is neglected , and @xmath70 .",
    "this is a good approximation at high energies , where the total cross sections @xmath2 and @xmath3 are asymptotically expected to be the same .",
    "however , below @xmath71 gev the @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross sections are different , as happens in other channels like @xmath72 and @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 and @xmath75 . therefore it is reasonable to expect the same behavior for the channels @xmath0 and @xmath76 . to account for these possible differences at low energy in the case of @xmath8 and @xmath77",
    "we apply the prescription dictated by the additive quark model also in the odd eikonal of eq .",
    "( [ oddeik ] ) , @xmath78 and the full physical eikonal , combining the even and odd parts , will be finally given by @xmath79 .",
    "assuming vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , the eikonalized @xmath0 total cross section can be written as @xmath80 , \\label{degt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the probability that the photon interacts as a hadron . in the simplest vmd formulation",
    "this probability is expected to be of @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath64 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are vector mesons . however , there are expected contributions to @xmath7 other than @xmath64 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",

    "@xcite a good fit to the photoproduction data is obtained with the value @xmath86 , which includes a non - vmd contribution of @xmath87 . in this case",
    "there are strong contributions of heavier vector mesons and continuum states .",
    "moreover , the probability @xmath7 may also depend on the energy , which is a possibility that we will explore in this paper .    to extend the model to the @xmath1 channel",

    "apart from the equations that we have displayed above , we will introduce two possible modifications when we present our results in the next section .",
    "one is related to a feasible energy dependence of @xmath7 , and the other is concerned with the requirement of a normalization factor in the @xmath9 calculation .",
    "in our analysis the center - of - mass energy thresholds for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels are the same that one used in the study of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels : @xmath93 gev .",
    "we adopt a @xmath94 fitting procedure , assuming an interval @xmath95 corresponding , in the case of normal errors , to the projection of the @xmath94 hypersurface containing 90% of probability . in the case of 1 , 2 and 3 free parameters , this corresponds to the interval @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "we use the data set for @xmath8 compiled and analyzed by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , with the statistic and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "data on @xmath1 total hadronic cross sections are also available on the pdg compilation , but the @xmath1 data quoted by the pdg are the average of the results obtained by unfolding the data with the pythia @xcite and the phojet @xcite monte carlo generators .",
    "these event generators , based on a model by schuler and sjstrand @xcite ( pythia ) and on the dual parton model @xcite ( phojet ) , are used to simulate photon - photon interactions and , in general , data unfolded with pythia are higher than if unfolded with phojet . as a consequence",
    "we obtain totally different scenarios for the rise of the total hadronic @xmath1 cross section at high energies . for this reason",
    ", we have deconvoluted the data on @xmath9 of the l3 @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations , according to whether pythia or phojet was used .",
    "therefore , instead of using the pdg data for @xmath9 , we performed global fits considering separately the data obtained through the pythia and phojet codes , defining two data sets as    set i : @xmath99 and @xmath100 data ( @xmath101 gev ) , + set ii : @xmath99 and @xmath102 data ( @xmath101 gev ) ,    where @xmath100 ( @xmath102 ) correspond to the data of @xmath1 total hadronic cross section obtained via the pythia ( phojet ) generator .",
    "the unfolded results are depicted in the figure 1 .",
    "this strategy of analysis is similar to the one adopted by block and kang , where a global test of factorization for nucleon - nucleon , @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering was performed through real analytic amplitudes @xcite .",
    "their results have evidenced the critical role played by the monte carlo simulations used by l3 and opal group .",
    "our first analysis ( henceforth referred to as fit i ) consisted in the determination of the @xmath103 values from fits to the data sets defined above . in the fit to the set i we obtained @xmath104 ; the @xmath105 for this fit was 3.29 .",
    "the fit to the set ii has resulted in @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",
    "these values are shown in table ii .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross sections corresponding to these values of @xmath103 are shown by the solid curves in figure 2 .",
    "the results of the fit to the set i are displayed in figs .",

    "2(c ) and 2(d ) . in the fit",
    "i the @xmath105 values are relatively high . however , as we already commented , the extraction of @xmath1 data from @xmath15 processes is strongly sensitive to the monte carlo simulation , and this procedure could require a systematic overall - normalization factor in the experimental data .",
    "in fact , the cross section @xmath108 is determined from the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath109 by means of both the luminosity function @xmath110 for the photon flux and the hadronic cross section @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the cross section extrapolation to real photons ( @xmath112 ) is estimated to be 5 - 7.5% , and this uncertainty is not included in the systematic error of the measurement @xcite . in this case",
    "we can introduce a normalization factor in the @xmath9 data as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite or , what we have chosen to do , just multiply eq .",

    "\\label{hudrt4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    within this approach ( henceforth referred to as fit ii ) we carried out new fits to the sets i and ii described above .",
    "we obtained for the set i ( set ii ) the values @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , with @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "these values are shown in table ii .",

    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , whereas the results of the fit to the set ii are displayed in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) .",
    "we notice that the approach adopted in the fit ii leads to an improvement of the fits , since the @xmath105 values obtained through the fit ii are smaller than ones obtained through the fit i. these results indicate the convenience of introducing a normalization factor in order to account for possible effects not included in the systematic error of @xmath9 data .    in the sequence",
    "we have also explored the possibility that @xmath7 varies with the energy .",
    "such possibility has been raised in the past @xcite , although there are arguments against it @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a phenomenological expression for @xmath7 , implying that it increases logarithmically with the square of the center of mass energy : @xmath121 .",
    "our intention was just to see if the quality of the fit improves in such situation , referred to as fit iii .",
    "the results of the fit to the set i were : @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , with @xmath125 .",
    "the fit results to the set ii were : @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , with @xmath129 .",
    "all these results are shown in table iii and the total cross section curves are depicted in figure 3 , where figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) are related to the set i whereas the figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) are related to the set ii .",
    "considering the smaller @xmath105 values obtained when @xmath7 increases with the energy ( fit iii ) , we believe that this possibility can not be completely neglected .",
    "in all the cases we see that the data of @xmath100 above @xmath71 gev can hardly be described by our model , but this is also a problem for other models in the literature @xcite based on the factorization assumption @xmath130    assuming the correctness of these models we may interpret the steeper rise of the @xmath9 appointed by the pythia as a possible signal of violation of the factorization relation . otherwise this behavior indicates a possible failure of the pythia generator at high - energies . the latter possibility is qualitatively supported by the results depicted in the figures 3(c ) and 3(d ) , that show that the shape and normalization of the phojet cross sections are in good agreement with the factorization relation ( [ fact ] ) .",
    "our first aim and main result was to show that an eikonal qcd inspired model based on a nonperturbative infrared dynamical gluon mass scale @xcite , with the help of vector meson dominance and the additive quark model , can successfully describe the data of the total photoproduction @xmath0 and total hadronic @xmath1 cross sections .",
    "the calculation is similar to the one of block _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , with the advantage that in the dgm model one has a physical meaning for the infrared scale , and the coupling constant is not a free parameter , turning out to be related to the dynamical gluon mass scale .",
    "we promoted some minor changes in the calculation , assuming that @xmath7 , the probability that a photon interacts as a hadron , has a logarithmic increase with @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to a improvement in the fit , i. e. it lowers the @xmath105 values .",
    "there are pros @xcite and cons @xcite about this possibility .",
    "we just point out that the logarithmic increase of @xmath7 with @xmath20 is quite favored by the data .",
    "we verified that the data of @xmath100 above @xmath71 gev can hardly be described by our model , but this is also a problem for other models in the literature . assuming the correctness of these models we could say that the phojet generator is more appropriate to obtain the @xmath9 data above @xmath71 gev .",
    "connected with this comment we can recall that recently block and kaidalov demonstrated that the factorization relation ( [ fact ] ) does not depend on the assumption of an additive quark model , but more on the opacity of the eikonal being independent of the nature of the reaction @xcite .",
    "hence , according to this result , we argue that it will be difficult for qcd - inspired models incorporating the total cross section factorization hypothesis to accommodate the @xmath108 data with @xmath131 gev unfolded with the pythia monte carlo generator .",
