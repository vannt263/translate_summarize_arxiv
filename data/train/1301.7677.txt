    "the successful launch of the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray space telescope affords us an ideal opportunity to investigate the inner workings of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the ability of the _ fermi_-lat detector to scan the entire @xmath0-ray sky every three hours allows us to study the @xmath0-ray emission from agn , unbiased by activity state or agn sub - class .",
    "this ability has revealed the blazar subclass of agn to be the most numerous class of known @xmath0-ray sources ( @xcite ) , with approximately equal number of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lac objects ( @xcite ) . furthermore , not only do blazars dominated the extra - galactic @xmath0-ray sky , but during brief periods of intense flare activity , they can outshine galactic @xmath0-ray sources as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the radio lobes of the nearby radio galaxy , centarus a ( @xcite ) , the @xmath0-ray emission region of agn remains unresolved .",
    "as such , the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission within blazars remains an open question . answering this question is an active area of agn research , with two main schools of thought :",
    "on the one hand , some believe the @xmath0-ray emission originates from within the broad line region ( blr ) of the agn , while on the other hand , some believe the @xmath0-ray originates further out from the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) , within the molecular torus ( mt ) region of the agn .    traditionally the @xmath0-ray emission has been assumed to be close to the base of the relativistic jet , within the blr .",
    "the reasoning for this assumption is two - fold : broad - band spectral energy distribution modelling and rapid @xmath0-ray flux variability on small timescales .",
    "multi - wavelength ( mwl ) observations of fsrqs have found the broad - band spectral energy distribution to be adequately described by a leptonic model , with the emission region located within @xmath12 schwarzschild radii from the central smbh ( for example , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , the rapid flux variability implies a small emission region size .",
    "this is often interpreted as evidence of the emission region being located close to the base of the jet .",
    "this interpretation is based on the assumption that the full width of the relativistic jet is responsible for the observed @xmath0-ray emission and that the size of the emission region , @xmath13 , is simply related to the opening angle of the relativistic jet , @xmath14 , and the distance from the smbh , @xmath15 , via @xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the wealth of information afford to us by the _",
    "fermi_-lat detector has found evidence of spectral breaks at gev energies in the @xmath0-ray spectrum of some agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "these spectral breaks have been interpreted in the context of @xmath0-ray absorption through photon - photon pair - production with the he lyman recombination continuum of the blr ( @xcite ) , thus pointing to a blr origin of the observed @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "it is worth noting though , that this interpretation has recently been brought into question ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0-ray emission from agn has also been suggested to originate from the mt region of the jet , on the parsec - scale distance from the central smbh .",
    "this suggestion is primarily based on the results of recent mwl observations which have found @xmath0-ray flaring events to be accompanied by flare events at optical or radio wavelengths , with some of these radio flares being resolved on a parsec - scale distance from the smbh ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for an mt origin of the @xmath0-ray emission comes from the detection of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emission from fsrqs . to date",
    ", 3 fsrqs have been detected at energies @xmath17 gev , of which pks 1510 - 089 is one ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the photon - rich environment of the blr of fsrqs is believed to severely attenuate any @xmath0-ray emission through photon - photon pair production , resulting in a spectral cut - off above @xmath9 gev ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite ) . as such , the detection of vhe emission is difficult to explain with a pure blr - origin for the observed @xmath0-ray .",
    "one of the primary arguments against an mt origin for the @xmath0-ray emission is that the further an emission region is from the central smbh , the bigger it is through the combined effects of adiabatic expansion and the opening angle of the jet .",
    "however , this argument is only valid if the entire width of the relativistic jet is responsible for the observed @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "what is more , this argument assumes that process of adiabatic expansion is dominant over any re - collimation process that occurs along the length of the jet .",
    "the latter assumption is not valid if the jet undergoes re - confinement ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , detailed computer simulations have found that jet instabilities can result in large over - densities in the matter distribution at large distances from the central smbh ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , using the above arguments , evidence has been found for the the @xmath0-ray emission region of pks 1510 - 089 to be located in both the blr and the mt . from the first 11 months of _ fermi_-lat operation , abdo et al . concluded that the @xmath0-ray emission originated from within the blr ( @xcite ) ; this conclusion primarily being driven by the presence of a cut - off in the @xmath0-ray spectrum . however , both marscher et al . and orienti et al .",
    "have concluded from their respective mwl campaigns of pks 1510 - 089 that the @xmath0-ray originates from outside blr region ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with their conclusions primarily based on the flaring events being observed simultaneously at @xmath0-ray , optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "it is important to note however , that these three mwl studies focused on three separate flaring events .",

    "this approach has two important caveats : firstly , for consecutive flux values where the difference is less than a factor of two , the variability timescale calculated is essentially a prediction of how long it would take for a double or halving of flux to occur if the observed change in flux continued at its current rate .",
    "secondly , the variability timescales calculated assumes that the flux increase or decrease is constant throughout the 3 hour bin , and as such , should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "probing timescales smaller than those observed is primarily limited by the 3 hour period that _",
    "fermi_-lat takes to scan the entire sky and the amount of time a source is in the bore sight of the lat instrument where the sensitivity is the greatest .",

    "was found to be @xmath68 hours at mjd@xmath69 , and the shortest halving decay time , @xmath70 , was @xmath6 hours at mjd@xmath71 .",
    "it is worth highlighting that there are several instances of variability on even smaller timescales , for example on mjd@xmath72 the intrinsic variability timescale was @xmath73 hours , however with large uncertainties in the variability timescale , these events do not satisfy the @xmath74 criterion .",
    "a similar study was undertaken by @xcite for the fsrqs 3c 454.3 , 3c 273 and pks b@xmath75 utilising @xmath76 years of lat observations .",
    "this study revealed intrinsic flux variability in the @xmath77 hour range , but only at the @xmath78 level of certainty .",
    "furthermore , foschini et al . adopted a conservative approach , and only calculated the variability timescale between subsequent flux measurements with a @xmath78 difference in magnitude .",
    "if the same approach is applied to the variability events in table 1 , the shortest rise and decay timescales are still found to be @xmath68 and @xmath6 hours respectively . indeed , even requiring a @xmath79 difference in consecutive flux values to calculate the associated doubling / halving timescale ,",

    "the implications for the size of this variability is discussed in 4 .",
    "taking the doppler factor of the relativistic jet into consideration , causality implies that the size of an emission region , r , with a doppler factor where @xmath32 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the angle to the line of sight . ]",

    "radio observations of pks 1510 - 089 during february to june 2010 have shown that structures within its relativistic jet have doppler factors of @xmath90 ( @xcite ) , while observations during 1998 to 2001 show similiar values of @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if one assumes these rather extreme values for the doppler factor are a good representation of the average velocity structure within pks 1510 - 089 s relativistic jet , the emission regions of the flares reported here are found to be less than @xmath92 parsecs in size .",
    "this suggests that only a very small portion of the relativistic jet is responsible for the observed @xmath0-ray flares .    while these rapid variability timescales allow us to gain insights into the physical properties of the @xmath0-ray emission region , the extreme nature of the variability does little to constrain the location of the emission region .",
    "small structure within the relativistic jet is not unique to just the inner regions of the agn ; small over - densities of plasma can occur in the jet at both the sub - parsec , blr , and the parsec - scale , mt region ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "external to the jet however , the environment of the blr and mt are significantly different , with the energy distribution of the blr photon field peaking at uv energies , while in the mt it peaks at ir energies .",
    "this difference in photon energies , and the subsequent cooling effect they have on the energy distribution of the particle population within the emission region , can be utilised to constrain the origin of the @xmath0-rays .",

    "<S> i present a study of the high - energy @xmath0-ray properties of the flat spectrum radio quasar , pks 1510 - 089 , based on 3.75 years of observations with the large area telescope ( lat ) detector on - board the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray space telescope . throughout the observing period , the 0.1 gev @xmath1 300 gev @xmath0-ray flux was highly variable , undergoing several flaring events where the daily flux exceeded 10@xmath2 photons @xmath3s@xmath4 on 3 separate occasions . </S>",
    "<S> the increased photon statistics of these large flares allowed the observations to be re - analysed in 6 and 3 hour intervals , revealing flux doubling timescales as small as @xmath5 hours during the flare rise time , and flux halving timescales of @xmath6 hours during the flare decay . </S>",
    "<S> these are the smallest variability timescales measured to date at mev@xmath7gev energies for the flat spectrum quasar class of active galactic nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 photons @xmath3s@xmath4 flare events were also studied in more detail in an attempt to uncover evidence for the location of pks 1510 - 089 s @xmath0-ray emission region . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> two approaches were used : ( i ) searching for an energy dependence to the cooling timescales , and ( ii ) searching for evidence of a spectral cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> the combined results of these two approaches , along with the confirmation of @xmath9 gev photon flux from pks 1510 - 089 , suggest the presence of multiple @xmath0-ray emission regions being located in both the broad line region and molecular torus region of pks 1510 - 089 .    </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the highest photon events within the 3.75 year data set finds pks 1510 - 089 to be a source of @xmath10 gev @xmath0-rays at the @xmath11 confidence level ; a observational property which is difficult to explain in the traditional view that @xmath0-ray emission from active galactic nuclei originates from the base of the relativistic jet . </S>",
    "<S> this gives further weight to the argument that there are multiple , simultaneously active @xmath0-ray emission regions located along the relativistic jet of active galactic nuclei .    </S>",
