    "electromagnetic fields , especially magnetic fields play a role in astrophysics in the context of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "a complete relativistic understanding of such situations requires studying the coupled einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "of special interest are stationary axisymmetric situations since isolated matter configurations in thermodynamical equilibrium belong within relativity to this class , see @xcite . since the stationary axisymmetric einstein - maxwell equations in vacuum in the form of ernst @xcite are completely integrable ( see @xcite ) , powerful solution generating techniques from the theory of solitons are at hand to obtain physically interesting solutions .",
    "but the equations in the matter region  which is generally approximated as an ideal fluid  do not seem to be integrable .",
    "this makes it difficult to find global solutions which hold both in a three - dimensionally extended matter region and in vacuum .    to obtain global solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations with these methods , one",
    "is thus limited to two - dimensionally extended matter distributions , i.e.  surface layers .",
    "infinitesimally thin disks have been discussed in newtonian astrophysics as models for certain galaxies , see @xcite , and as models for the matter in accretion disks around black holes , see @xcite and references therein . in this case",
    "the equations in the matter region reduce to ordinary differential equations the solutions of which determine boundary data for the vacuum equations .",
    "alternatively surface layers can be obtained by ` cut and glue ' techniques .",
    "bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite studied static spacetimes , from which they removed a strip and glued the remainder together .",
    "the non - continuous normal derivatives at the gluing plane lead to a @xmath2-type energy - momentum tensor which can be interpreted as an infinitely extended disk made up of counter - rotating dust .",
    "this method was extended in @xcite to generate disk sources of the kerr - metric . with the same techniques , disk sources for kerr - newman metrics @xcite , static axisymmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields @xcite and",
    "conformastationary metrics @xcite were given .",
    "counter - rotating disks are discussed in astrophysics as models for certain @xmath3 and @xmath4 galaxies ( see @xcite and references given therein ) .",
    "these galaxies show counter - rotating matter components and are believed to be the consequence of the merger of galaxies .",
    "recent investigations have shown that there is a large number of galaxies ( see @xcite , the first was ngc 4550 in virgo ) which show counter - rotating streams in the disk with up to 50 % counter - rotation .    by construction",
    "all disks due to ` cut and glue ' techniques have an infinite extension but finite mass since the mass of the spacetime is not changed by the method .",
    "the matter in the disks can be interpreted as a two - dimensional fluid with a purely azimuthal pressure .",
    "if the energy conditions in the disk are satisfied and if the pressure in the disk is positive , the matter can alternatively be interpreted as consisting of two counter - rotating streams of pressureless matter , so - called dust . in the pure vacuum case",
    "this is best done by introducing observers rotating with the disk in a way that the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal for them .",
    "it can be shown that the corresponding dust streams move on geodesics of the inner geometry of the disk . in the electro - vacuum case , the corresponding condition on the matter is motion on electro - geodesics , i.e.  solutions to the geodesic equation in the presence of a lorentz force .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this is a more restrictive condition than in the pure vacuum case .",
    "for vacuum so - called riemann - hilbert techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) were used to generate solutions for disks of finite extension .",
    "explicit metrics could be given in terms of theta functions on hyperelliptic riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "since these two - sheeted surfaces are a generalization of the well - known elliptic surfaces , a powerful theory is at hand to treat hyperelliptic functions .",
    "the main advantages of this class are that it is very rich ( ` solitonic ' solutions as the kerr solution for a rotating black hole are contained as limiting cases ) , and that a whole subclass with physically interesting solutions could be identified in @xcite by studying the analyticity properties of the solution . the corresponding solutions for the electro - vacuum are given on three - sheeted surfaces @xcite which are mathematically less well understood .",
    "recent progress in this context was made by korotkin @xcite by considering the riemann - hilbert problem on multi - sheeted coverings of the complex plane .",
    "the solutions to this problem which can be used to solve the einstein - maxwell equations are again given in terms of theta functions .",
    "until now there are , however , no explicit examples for physically realistic disk solutions on three - sheeted riemann surfaces .",
    "therefore an intermediate step was taken in @xcite where hyperelliptic solutions with charge were studied .",
    "these solutions were obtained by exploiting the @xmath1 invariance of the stationary einstein - maxwell equations ( see @xcite to @xcite ) .",
    "using a so - called harrison transformation @xcite , one can generate solutions with charge from solutions to the pure vacuum equations .",
    "a remarkable property of the corresponding spacetimes is the fact that their gyromagnetic ratio is always identical to 2 as in the case of the kerr - newman black holes .",
    "this is of interest in the context of claims in @xcite that this property is a hint on a deep connection between general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics . by studying the asymptotics of harrison - transformed pure vacuum solutions",
    ", it was shown that the thus obtained solutions will always have a non - vanishing total charge which limits their astrophysical relevance since charges seem to neutralize in our universe .",
    "this is a hint that astrophysically interesting solutions without total charge , but non - vanishing magnetic fields in terms of theta functions are to be expected only on three - sheeted surfaces .",

    "we add some concluding remarks .",
    "to illustrate the basic concepts used in the following sections , we will briefly recall some facts on newtonian dust disks .",
    "in newtonian theory , gravitation is described by a scalar potential @xmath5 which is a solution to the laplace equation in the vacuum region .",
    "the units in this article are chosen in a way that the newtonian gravitational constant , the dielectric constant and the velocity of light are equal to 1 .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and place the disk made up of a pressureless two - dimensional ideal fluid with radius @xmath9 in the equatorial plane @xmath10 . in newtonian theory stationary perfect fluid solutions and thus also the here considered disks are known to be equatorially symmetric .",
    "since we concentrate on dust disks , i.e.  pressureless matter , the only force to compensate gravitational attraction in the disk is the centrifugal force .",
    "this leads in the disk to ( here and in the following @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angular velocity of the dust at radius @xmath6 . since all terms in ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "are quadratic in @xmath14 there are no effects due to the sign of the angular velocity .",
    "the absence of these so - called gravitomagnetic effects in newtonian theory implies that disks with counter - rotating components will behave with respect to gravity exactly as disks made up of only one component .",
    "we will therefore only consider the case of one component in this section .",
    "integrating ( [ eq1 ] ) we get the boundary data @xmath15 with an integration constant @xmath16 which is related to the central redshift in the relativistic case .    to find the newtonian solution for a given rotation law @xmath13 , we have to construct a solution to the laplace equation which is everywhere regular except at the disk where it has to take the boundary data ( [ eq1 ] ) . at the disk",
    "the normal derivatives of the potential will have a jump since the disk is a surface layer .",
    "notice that one only has to solve the vacuum equations since the two - dimensional matter distribution merely leads to boundary conditions for the laplace equation .",
    "in the newtonian setting one thus has to determine the density for a given rotation law or vice versa , a well known problem ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) for newtonian dust disks .",
    "there are several ways to construct newtonian dust disks .",
    "we will only outline two possibilities which can be used with some modifications also in the relativistic case .",
    "one way to construct newtonian disks is to start with a known equatorially symmetric solution to the laplace equation , for instance the solution for a point mass @xmath17 , @xmath18 then a strip of width @xmath19 is cut out of the space symmetrically to the equatorial plane .",
    "the solutions for positive and negative @xmath7 are displace in @xmath7-direction by @xmath20 and glued together at the equatorial plane .",
    "the discontinuity at this plane leads to a surface layer of infinite extension .    in the example of a point mass considered by kuzmin @xcite and toomre @xcite",
    ", this leads to the solution @xmath21 the surface density @xmath22 at the equatorial plane is just given by @xmath23 , in the example @xmath24 by construction the spacetime has finite mass @xmath17 since the asymptotics have not been changed by the procedure of cutting and glueing .",
    "the disk is infinite , but the mass density decreases because of ( [ eq : point3 ] ) as @xmath25 . since the mass density is positive , the matter in the disk can be interpreted as a disk of dust . the angular velocity as defined in ( [ eq1 ] ) is in this example given by @xmath26 asymptotically the angular velocity satisfies the kepler relation @xmath27 for test particles .",
    "thus the matter in the disk behaves for large distances from the center as free particles .",
    "though the gravitational field ( [ eq : point ] ) can be seen as generated by the self - gravitating matter in the disk , particles in large distances from the center can be viewed as test particles since the the density tends to zero .",
    "the so constructed disks thus have physically acceptable properties : a positive mass density and a finite mass .",
    "though they have an infinite extension , the density decreases rapidly for @xmath28 .",
    "since the laplace equation is linear , arbitrary linear combinations of potentials of the form ( [ eq : point ] ) will always leads to infinite disks .",
    "evans and de zeeuw @xcite considered disk potentials of the form @xmath29 which leads to the general classical disk formula .",
    "bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite used this technique to generate disk solutions to the static axisymmetric einstein equations .      to generate disks of finite extension , we use an approach which can be generalized to some extent to the relativistic case .",
    "the resulting expression will be shown to be equivalent to the poisson integral for a distributional density .",
    "we put @xmath30 without loss of generality ( we are only considering disks of finite non - zero radius ) and obtain @xmath5 as the solution of a so - called riemann - hilbert problem ( see e.g.  @xcite and references given therein ) . the solution can be written in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( hlder continuous on @xmath33 ) and where @xmath33 is the covering of the imaginary axis in the upper sheet of @xmath34 between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xmath34 is the riemann surface of genus 0 given by the algebraic relation @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 has to be subject to the conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it may be checked by direct calculation that @xmath5 in ( [ newton2 ] ) is a solution to the laplace equation except at the disk .",
    "the reality condition on @xmath38 leads to a real potential , whereas the symmetry condition with respect to the involution @xmath41 leads to equatorial symmetry .",
    "the occurrence of the logarithm in ( [ newton2 ] ) is due to the riemann - hilbert problem with the help of which the solution to the laplace equation was constructed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath42 is determined by the boundary data @xmath15 or the energy density @xmath22 of the dust via @xmath43 or @xmath44 respectively where @xmath45 .",
    "this can be seen in the following way : + at the disk the potential takes due to the equatorial symmetry the boundary values @xmath46 and @xmath47 both equations constitute integral equations for the ` jump data ' @xmath42 of the riemann - hilbert problem if the respective left - hand side is known . the equations ( [ newton3 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are both abelian integral equations and can be solved in terms of quadratures , i.e.   ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) .    to show the regularity of the potential @xmath5",
    ", we prove that the integral ( [ newton2 ] ) is identical to the poisson integral for a distributional density which reads at the disk @xmath48 where @xmath49 and where @xmath50 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . eliminating @xmath42 in ( [ newton3 ] ) via ( [ eq5 ] ) we obtain after interchange of the order of integration @xmath51 which is identical to ( [ eq7 ] ) since @xmath52 .",
    "thus the integral ( [ newton2 ] ) has the properties known from the poisson integral : it is a solution to the laplace equation which is everywhere regular except at the disk where the normal derivatives are discontinuous .",
    "we note that it is possible in the newtonian case to solve the boundary value problem purely locally at the disk . the regularity properties of the poisson integral",
    "then ensure global regularity of the solution except at the disk .",
    "such a purely local treatment will not be possible in the relativistic case .",
    "the above considerations make clear that one can not prescribe both @xmath5 at the disk ( and thus the rotation law ) and the density independently .",
    "this just reflects the fact that the laplace equation is an elliptic equation for which cauchy problems are ill - posed .",
    "if @xmath42 is determined by either ( [ eq4 ] ) or ( [ eq5 ] ) for given rotation law or density , expression ( [ newton2 ] ) gives the analytic continuation of the boundary data to the whole spacetime . in case",
    "we prescribe the angular velocity , the constant @xmath53 is determined by the condition @xmath54 which excludes a ring singularity at the rim of the disk . for rigid rotation ( @xmath55 )",
    ", we get e.g.@xmath56 which leads with ( [ newton2 ] ) to the well - known maclaurin disk .      in a newtonian theory gravity and electromagnetism decouple",
    ". disks of pressureless charged matter will lead to a gravitational potential @xmath5 as above and to electric and magnetic fields . for disks with only one component of dust , there will be necessarily a magnetic field due to the rotating charges .",
    "static solutions are possible if two streams of charged dust with equal densities are exactly counter - rotating . in this case",
    "the magnetic field vanishes since the effects of both streams concerning magnetic fields just compensate .",
    "this trick was used by morgan and morgan @xcite within general relativity to describe static disks : in the case of two identical streams of counter - rotating particles the so - called ` gravitomagnetic ' effects of relativity cancel , and the resulting spacetime is static .    in the electrostatic case ,",
    "the electric potential is also a solution to the laplace equation .",
    "if we assume the electrical density @xmath57 to be proportional to the matter density @xmath22 in the case of a dust disk ( both densities are surface densities ) , i.e.  @xmath58 , we get from newton s law @xmath59 the relation @xmath60 thus one can infer the tangential derivative at the disk for given @xmath14 and constant @xmath61 and then solve the boundary value problem for the laplace equation as above .",
    "the electric and the gravitational potential are in this example just proportional",
    ". similarly one can prescribe @xmath22 and obtain @xmath14 from ( [ newton ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 has to be smaller than 1 . for @xmath63 , the angular velocity in the dust disk vanishes .",
    "in this section we study the einstein - maxwell equations in the presence of one killing vector .",
    "we explore the group structure of the equations and give the harrison transformation which generates electro - vacuum solutions from pure vacuum solutions .",
    "the solutions contain an additional real parameter related to the total charge .",
    "general properties of the transformed spacetimes as the asymptotics are discussed . in the stationary axisymmetric case , complete integrability of the equations is established .",
    "it is instructive to consider first the maxwell equations in the absence of gravity , i.e.  on a flat background . in standard notation , the equations for the electric and respectively magnetic fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 read @xmath66 since @xmath67 , one can define ( up to gauge freedoms ) a vector potential via @xmath68 .",
    "it is convenient for the relativistic treatment in the following sections to introduce four - dimensional notation .",
    "we use the convention that greek indices take the values @xmath69 and latin indices the values @xmath70 .",
    "a four - dimensional vector potential @xmath71 is introduced which is related to the tensor @xmath72 of the electromagnetic fields via @xmath73 in vacuum , the maxwell equations read ( indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric ) @xmath74 they can be obtained from the action @xmath75    obviously the equations ( [ max ] ) are invariant under the discrete exchange @xmath76 .",
    "in addition they are invariant under the continuous rotations @xmath77 or in terms of the fields , @xmath78 .",
    "this is the well known @xmath79 symmetry of the maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "it can be used to ` generate ' solutions from known ones : if for instance a solution with vanishing magnetic field is given , the @xmath79-symmetry can be applied to generate from the given electric field a solution with non - vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the transformed fields contain a new real parameter . in case",
    "there is an electric monopole moment , there will be a magnetic monopole moment in the transformed solution .",
    "this often limits the physical relevance of the so generated solutions .    in the stationary case",
    ", the potential @xmath80 can be chosen to be independent of the time coordinate @xmath81 . since @xmath82",
    ", we can define a scalar potential via @xmath83 , the well - known magnetic potential for stationary fields .",
    "the equation @xmath67 implies @xmath84 . in four - dimensional language which will be needed in the einstein - maxwell case ,",
    "this construction works as follows : since @xmath85 is a three - dimensional antisymmetric tensor , it can be dualized to an axial vector by contraction with the totally antisymmetric @xmath86-tensor .",
    "the maxwell equations ( [ max ] ) @xmath87 imply that this vector must be a gradient of some potential @xmath88 .",
    "we can thus define the potential @xmath88 via @xmath89 the potentials can be combined to the complex potential @xmath90 . in this case",
    "the action is just given by @xmath91 and the maxwell equations read @xmath92 in the stationary case , the maxwell equations are thus equivalent to the laplace equation for a single complex potential @xmath93 .",
    "in the einstein - maxwell case , the maxwell equations have the same form as in ( [ max ] ) , only the partial derivatives have to be replaced by covariant derivatives since the spacetime is no longer flat , @xmath94 the tracefree energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath95 the einstein equations have the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the metric of the spacetime , @xmath98 the ricci tensor and @xmath99 the ricci scalar . with ( [ eq : enmom ] ) we get for ( [ eq : einstein ] ) @xmath100 equations ( [ max ] ) and ( [ einstein ] ) form the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "they can be derived from the action @xmath101 since the maxwell fields only enter the einstein equations via the energy - momentum tensor , the @xmath79 symmetry ( [ eq : u1 ] ) carries over to the einstein - maxwell case and can be used to generate solutions as before .    in general one would expect that the above @xmath79 invariance of the einstein - maxwell equations is the only symmetry of the equations even in the presence of killing symmetries in the spacetime .",
    "however , it turns out that a much bigger symmetry group exists already for a single killing vector .",
    "it is convenient to use a projection formalism which goes back to ehlers @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite for additional references .",
    "the case considered here can be viewed as a special case of the standard dimensional reduction of kaluza - klein @xcite and supergravity theories @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the metric is written in the form @xmath102 we are considering here for convenience the stationary case , i.e.  we use coordinates in which the timelike killing vector is given by @xmath103 , all potentials are independent of @xmath81 . however , the results hold with minor changes for general killing vectors .",
    "coordinates are introduced for convenience , the dimensional reduction can also be carried out in a coordinate - independent way . we assume that the killing vector is timelike throughout the spacetime , i.e.  that its norm @xmath104 does not vanish .",
    "the vector potential is decomposed as the metric into pieces parallel and orthogonal to the killing vector , @xmath105 .",
    "the lagrangian of ( [ eq : action1 ] ) can then be written in the form @xmath106 where @xmath34 is a three - dimensional lagrangian density , where @xmath107 , and where @xmath108 .",
    "all indices are raised and lowered with @xmath109 .",
    "note that the tensor @xmath110 vanishes only if the killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal in which case the spacetime is static .",
    "the first part of the maxwell equations ( [ max ] ) can be written in the form @xmath111 which implies @xmath112 . with this relation or by varying ( [ eq : langrangean ] ) with respect to @xmath113 , we obtain @xmath114 we can define as before the potential @xmath88 via @xmath115 again @xmath116 and @xmath88 can be combined to the complex electromagnetic potential @xmath90 .",
    "similarly we get by varying ( [ eq : langrangean ] ) with respect to @xmath117 @xmath118 this can be dualized as above by introducing the so - called twist potential @xmath119 via @xmath120 the potentials @xmath104 and @xmath119 can be combined to the complex ernst potential , @xmath121    the scalars @xmath119 and @xmath88 replace the vectors @xmath117 and @xmath113 .",
    "the corresponding three - dimensional lagrangian reads with @xmath122 @xmath123 the line element @xmath124 describes the invariant metric of the riemannian symmetric space @xmath125 $ ] in some coordinates .",

    "harrison transformations offer the possibility to generate solutions with charge from pure vacuum solution .",

    "we assume that the pure vacuum solutions which we want to submit to a harrison transformation satisfy these conditions . to ensure that the transformed solutions have the same asymptotic behavior",

    "note that in this formulation the solution of the riemann - hilbert problem is not unique ; different solutions are related by so - called schlesinger transformations ( multiplications from the left with appropriate matrix - valued rational functions ) .",
    "it is known that the riemann - hilbert problem can not be solved explicitly in terms of known special functions in the generic case .",
    "the largest class of explicitly solvable problems known so far is in the class of problems with quasi - permutation monodromies ( when each row and each column of monodromy matrix contain exactly one non - vanishing entry ) .",

    "the electro - geodesic equations leads to additional conditions on the matter which can only be satisfied in a certain range of the physical parameters . `",

    "these surfaces are hyperelliptic , which makes the use of the powerful hyperelliptic calculus possible .",
    "these solutions contain the ` solitonic ' solutions as the kerr solution as limiting cases .",
    "an important feature of the algebro - geometric solutions is that general regularity theorems can be established .",
    "thus the question of global regularity in the exterior of the disk source can be addressed . with these techniques , disks of finite extension",
    "can be constructed as the presented family of counter - rotating dust disks which leads to new solutions to the einstein equations .",

    ", it was shown that the disks always have a non - vanishing total charge and a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 . to generate solutions without total charge but with non - trivial magnetic field",

    "<S> we review explicit solutions to the stationary axisymmetric einstein - maxwell equations which can be interpreted as disks of charged dust . </S>",
    "<S> the disks of finite or infinite extension are infinitesimally thin and constitute a surface layer at the boundary of an electro - vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the einstein - maxwell equations in the presence of one killing vector are obtained by using a projection formalism . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to equations for three - dimensional gravity where the matter is given by a @xmath0 $ ] nonlinear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 invariance of the stationary einstein - maxwell equations can be used to construct solutions for the electro - vacuum from solutions to the pure vacuum case via a so - called harrison transformation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the corresponding solutions will always have a non - vanishing total charge and a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> since the vacuum and the electro - vacuum equations in the stationary axisymmetric case are completely integrable , large classes of solutions can be constructed with techniques from the theory of solitons . the richest class of physically interesting solutions to the pure vacuum case due to korotkin is given in terms of hyperelliptic theta functions . </S>",
    "<S> the harrison transformed hyperelliptic solutions are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> as a concrete example we study the transformation of a family of counter - rotating dust disks . to obtain algebro - geometric solutions with vanishing total charge which are of astrophysical relevance , three - sheeted surfaces have to be considered .    </S>",
    "<S> the matter in the disk is discussed following bik et al . </S>",
    "<S> we review the ` cut and glue ' technique where a strip is removed from an explicitly known spacetime and where the remainder is glued together after displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuities of the normal derivatives of the metric at the glueing hypersurface lead to infinite disks . </S>",
    "<S> if the energy conditions are satisfied and if the pressure is positive , the disks can be interpreted in the vacuum case as made up of two components of counter - rotating dust moving on geodesics . in electro - vacuum the condition of geodesic movement is replaced by electro - geodesic movement . as an example we discuss a class of harrison - transformed hyperelliptic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the range of parameters is identified where an interpretation of the matter in the disk in terms of electro - dust can be given . </S>"
