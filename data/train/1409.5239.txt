    "from the three prominent forms of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics presented by dirac  @xcite , the point form ( pf ) is the least explored .",
    "however , it possesses virtues that are worth exploiting for the study of relativistic composite systems .",
    "one of the most important features is that of the 10 generators of the poincar algebra , those forming the lorentz subgroup , rotations and boosts , are kinematic ( free of interactions ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the most familiar instant - form ( if ) , where the boost operators make changes of reference frames challenging , since they carry interaction terms ( they are dynamical ) .",
    "this is particularly problematic in quantum field theories , where the number of particles is not conserved .   the front form ( ff ) , despite being the form with the larger kinematical group ( containing 7 generators ) ,",
    "has the drawback that rotations are interaction dependent , and thus it makes the addition of angular momentum of relativistic interacting particles troublesome  @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", a considerable number of articles have been written with the goal of developing a new formalism able to describe the structure of hadrons or , more generally , of relativistic bound states in terms of the properties of their constituents by using the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics ( pfrqm ) ( cf .",
    "relativistic quantum mechanics , unlike quantum field theory , considers a restricted number of degrees of freedom .",
    "poincar invariance is ensured in this formalism by using the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite .",
    "its point - form version introduces a free velocity operator , that is multiplied by the interacting mass operator and leads to an interaction - dependent four - momentum operator  @xcite . using a coupled - channel approach for that mass operator",
    ", we can describe the physical process from which invariant amplitudes and hadronic currents can be calculated .",
    "an appropriate description of the structure of the current poses several problems , and it is not straightforward to derive electroweak currents with all the required properties . two basic features are poincar covariance and cluster separability  @xcite .",
    "our formalism in pfrqm has helped to understand the electroweak structure of hadrons in several ways .",
    "it was initially applied to calculate the spectrum and decay widths of vector and axial - vector mesons within the chiral constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "later , electromagnetic properties of spin-0 and spin-1 two - body bound states with equal - constituent masses were studied  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the relativistic multichannel formalism was extended to unequal - mass constituents and to weak decay form factors in the time - like momentum transfer region  @xcite .",
    "an additional condition that has to be satisfied by systems of unequal - constituent masses is to respect the heavy - quark symmetry predictions in the extreme case in which one of the masses is infinitely heavier than the other  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that our approach respects the required heavy - quark symmetry predictions  @xcite , i.e. relations between electromagnetic and weak form factors appear in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this guarantees that the formalism is general enough to be applied to systems of arbitrary constituent masses , and gives us the freedom to apply it to heavy - to - heavy , heavy - to - light and light - to - light meson transitions .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide the result of the application of our formalism to all these cases .",
    "@xcite provides the basis and the main motivation for the present work .",
    "there is a second important issue we would like to address .",
    "it is known that the bakamjian - thomas construction produces problems related to cluster separability  @xcite , which enter the calculation of form factors and may lead to unphysical contributions in the electromagnetic current  @xcite .",
    "it was observed in  @xcite that this is not the case in time - like processes , such as the weak decays we are going to consider in this work .",
    "weak form factors can be extracted unambiguously and there is no need to introduce any additional spurious contribution to ensure the required covariant properties of the hadronic currents .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the cluster problem is not present .",
    "the cluster problem is intrinsic to the bakamjian - thomas construction and we do not know any relativistic quantum mechanical approach that eliminates the cluster problem completely  @xcite .",
    "the need for additional covariants in space - like processes is similar to the occurrence within the covariant light - front formulation of carbonell et al .",
    "@xcite , in which the orientation of the light front has to be considered explicitly in order to render the front - form approach manifestly covariant .",
    "in fact , comparisons between the point- and the front - form electromagnetic form factors show that the number of needed spurious contributions in spin-0 and spin-1 two - body systems coincides in the pf and ff cases  @xcite . in ff ,",
    "one way to cure this problem is the introduction of pair - creation currents  @xcite , such as the so - called @xmath7-graphs .",
    "this is particularly necessary in ff when one considers time - like processes , where it is not possible to use the very convenient @xmath9 . for @xmath10 , additional covariants",
    "associated with zero modes are necessary in order to provide the appropriate lorentz structure of the weak current and a certain frame dependence of the form factors is encountered in processes that involve spin-1 mesons when the latter are considered as simple valence @xmath11 bound states  @xcite .",
    "these problems are closely related to the violation of rotational invariance in the calculation of one - body - current matrix elements in ff .",
    "as mentioned above , in pf we do not encounter such kind of covariance problems in the current for time - like momentum transfers and there is no need for introducing spurious contributions .",
    "thus , it is now interesting to consider a detailed numerical comparison between the point- and the front - form results for time - like processes . for this comparison",
    ", we choose the light - front quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite , and use the same harmonic - oscillator wave function and adopt the same harmonic - oscillator and mass parameters .",
    "non - valence contributions are not considered explicitly in this work , neither in the work of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since non - valence contributions enter differently in every form of dynamics , it is expected that considering the meson as a valence quark - antiquark pair only must result in different resulting form factors as well .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore twofold : on the one hand we apply the pfrqm approach to several particular cases of semileptonic decays using the harmonic - oscillator wave function that was used in previous works and obtain results that can be compared with experiments and with other approaches . with this",
    "we do not intend to make accurate predictions , but rather to explore the applicability of our pfrqm approach to a broader range of reactions . on the other hand",
    ", we perform a numerical comparison with an analogous front - form approach in which , as in our case , no additional nonvalence contributions are considered explicitly .",
    "our purpose is to pose the question about the different role that non - valence contributions such as @xmath7-graphs play in each role .",
    "the encountered differences reflect the fact that effects coming from vacuum fluctuations have to be treated differently in each form .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii condenses the most important steps in the procedure used by the pfrqm approach and applies it to the process of a general weak semileptonic decay . in section",
    "iii we present and analyze our numerical results obtained in several particular cases for pseudoscalar mesons decaying into a pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath12 ) as well as to vector mesons ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we compare our results with the analogous front - from approach and discuss the encountered numerical differences .",
    "conclusions and outlook are presented in section iv .",
    "two important concepts of this formalism , _ velocity states _ and _ vertex operators _ , are presented in appendices a and b , respectively .",
    "the starting point of the derivation of currents and form factors in pfrqm is the physical processes in which such form factors are measured . in this work",
    "we examine semineptonic decays of mesons . in order to describe the processes in a fully poincar - invariant way ,",
    "a multichannel version of the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite is employed . in the point form version of the bakamjian - thomas construction the four - momentum operator factorizes into an interacting mass operator and a free four - velocity operator : @xmath14 the four - velocity operator is free of interactions and is defined by @xmath15 .",
    "it describes the overall motion of the system .",
    "the mass operator @xmath16 , which depends on internal variables only , is the quantity of interest , since it contains the information of the internal structure of the system .",
    "the procedure to calculate invariant amplitudes of hadronic reactions , from which currents and form factors can be extracted , has been elaborately explained along several works , in which both electromagnetic and weak decays are considered ( see  @xcite for illustration , and  @xcite for deep details ) .",
    "we summarize here the most important steps that are required for the study of the processes in which we are interested , and will refer to the more extended literature when necessary .    we will consider @xmath12 meson transitions as well as @xmath13 meson transitions .",

    "thus , it might not be sophisticated enough to establish quantitative predictions which could be compared with experiments .",
    "nonetheless , it is necessary to carry out such calculations for several decays in order to understand how the point - form approach compares with other approaches and to learn at least qualitatively how the transition form factors depend on the kind of transition considered .",
    "numerical studies within such a simple model will serve as our starting point for future developments in pfrqm .",
    "we are particularly interested in comparisons with front - form results and in the role of non - valence contributions in the description of currents and form factors . in front form ,",
    "such non - valence contributions turn out to become important when one goes from space - like to time - like momentum transfers , and thus they may play a role in the point - form approach as well . for time - like momentum transfer it is not possible to use the @xmath9 frame in front form . as a consequence ,",

    "the importance of the @xmath7-graph contributions decreases with increasing the mass of the heavy quark and it vanishes in the heavy - quark limit , since an infinitely heavy quark - antiquark pair can not be produced out of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the numerical values obtained for the isgur - wise function within the point form approach agree with those obtained within the analogous front - form quark model   @xcite .",
    "as soon as the decay form factors are calculated for finite physical masses of the heavy quarks , differences between the point- and front - form approach must appear .",

    "<S> differences between point and front forms that are not seen in the heavy - quark limit of @xmath6-systems appear . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are attributed to the different role that the non - valence contributions play in the description of hadronic reactions in each form . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued how contributions from missing @xmath7-graphs can be estimated . </S>"
