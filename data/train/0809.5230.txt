    "the local su(2 ) rotation for the @xmath0 model@xcite is conveniently written using spinon doublets in the usual notation , @xmath10 . in terms of these doublets ,",
    "the sf state is defined by the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the pauli matrices , and the sum @xmath14 is taken over pairs of nearest - neighbor sites . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the following su(2 ) rotation : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "note that for @xmath17 , the sf hamiltonian is rotated to a @xmath1-wave superconductor , @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 represents the @xmath1-wave mean field with pairing @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the nonsuperconducting mean field with staggered u(1 ) fluxes equal to @xmath22 through each plaquette of the square lattice .",
    "the intermediate states for general @xmath6 contain both @xmath1-wave pairing and staggered fluxes .",
    "we now consider the mean - field hamiltonian at the intermediate values of @xmath6 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 as usual , the chemical potential @xmath26 is added to enforce the desired average particle number .",
    "we have also added a phenomenological next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath27 .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath20 of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmf ] ) are the effective parameters describing the variational ground state and quasiparticle spectrum of the @xmath0 model , for the physically relevant value @xmath29 : the hopping @xmath28 only weakly depends on doping ( at small doping ) and is approximately given by @xmath30.@xcite at @xmath31 doping , @xmath20 decreases slightly from @xmath32 in the sc state to @xmath33 in the sf state.@xcite    the value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping is taken to be @xmath34 , to mimick the experimental fermi surface observed in cuprates .",
    "earlier studies of gutzwiller - projected wavefunctions suggest that such an effective next - nearest - neighbor hopping may appear in the underdoped region as a consequence of strong correlations , even in the absence of the term in the physical hamiltonian.@xcite note that we keep this term unrotated in eq .  .    in our model , physical quantities at finite temperature",
    "are given by an appropriate functional integral over the mean - field parameters @xmath35 , weighted by a free energy which is almost flat in the directions parametrized by @xmath36 .",
    "as indicated earlier , we restrict our study to staggered su(2 ) rotations parametrized by the angle @xmath6 . at the same time , we neglect the amplitude fluctuations of @xmath20 , since the energy scale associated with these fluctuations is high : of the order of @xmath4 , in our approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy scale @xmath37 , responsible for the @xmath6-fluctuations , is much lower : at 10% doping it is estimated as @xmath38 ( per lattice site ) from variational monte carlo calculations.@xcite    the free energy describing classical fluctuations of @xmath6 contains a @xmath6-dependent `` condensation energy '' ( of the order @xmath39 ) and a gradient term@xcite @xmath40 .",
    "we assume a situation where the resulting correlation length @xmath41 is much larger than one lattice spacing.@xcite in this case , the characteristic temperature , below which the condensation energy selects the superconducting state over the staggered - flux one , is @xmath42 ( the same scale determines the temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless - type transition).@xcite for temperatures above that scale , but below @xmath43 , @xmath44 the order parameter slowly varies in space and takes all possible values related by the su(2 ) rotation .",
    "therefore , in this temperature range , we can approximate the classical fluctuations by an equal - weight statistical average over the uniform states with all possible values of @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding integration measure for @xmath6 is @xmath45 , inherited from the invariant measure on su(2 ) .",

    "this band doubling only happens for weak branches and at positive energy .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the asymmetry we find here is in the location of the two pseudogap coherence peaks with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "a different asymmetry in the renormalization of the coherent spectral weights in the superconducting state at low doping has been reported in recent variational monte carlo calculations , where the gutzwiller constraint @xmath5 is taken into account exactly.@xcite we expect that such a spectral - weight asymmetry is also present in our model ( if one includes the gutzwiller projection ) , but a confirmation would require an extensive numerical work .",
    "the most striking prediction of our model , the formation of a staggered - flux gap above the fermi energy , is difficult to verify directly in arpes experiments , because this effect only appears at positive energy , around @xmath93 . on the other hand , our more subtle prediction",
    ", the combination of superconducting and staggered - flux gaps into a single asymmetric gap , appearing in the antinodal region of the cuprates may well be within current experimental reach .",
    "however , it is clear that the widely applied energy - symmetrization of the photoemission intensities  @xcite inevitably destroys all such signs in the arpes spectra",
    ". a careful explicit removal of temperature- and device - dependent factors from the arpes intensity will be extremely important in order to detect these effects .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate experimental and theoretical effort in this direction .    _ note added . _",
    "after submission of this work , a possibly relevant arpes study of the pseudogap phase of underdoped bi2212 was published.@xcite these authors found a gap asymmetry in the experimental spectral function which is in agreement with our findings .",
    "an alternative approach to ours was able to fit these data with a phenomenological spectral function.@xcite    we would like to thank patrick a.  lee , tao li , alexander g.  abanov , george jackeli , mike r.  norman , and davor pavuna for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> we use an su(2 ) mean - field theory approach with input from variational wavefunctions of the @xmath0 model to study the electronic spectra in the pseudogap phase of cuprates . in our model , the intermediate - temperature state of underdoped cuprates </S>",
    "<S> is realized by classical fluctuations of the order parameter between the @xmath1-wave superconductor and the staggered - flux state . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral functions of the pure and the averaged states are computed and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts a photoemission spectrum with an asymmetric gap structure interpolating between the superconducting gap centered at the fermi energy and the asymmetric staggered - flux gap . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry of the gap changes sign at the points where the fermi surface crosses the diagonal @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most unusual and debated feature of high - temperature superconductivity  ( htsc ) is the pseudogap  ( pg ) phase , the high - temperature phase in the underdoped region of the phase diagram between the destruction of superconductivity at @xmath3 and the pseudogap temperature @xmath4.@xcite while the zero - temperature phase diagram of htsc is relatively well understood , there is currently much experimental and theoretical interest in the intermediate - temperature pg phase . in this phase , </S>",
    "<S> several surprising experimental features appear : e.g.  angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  ( arpes ) shows a state which is partially gapped on the experimental fermi surface.@xcite    theoretically , the low - temperature physics of htsc is well described by variational wavefunctions of the @xmath0 model.@xcite the antiferromagnetic parent state at half filling is destroyed as doping is increased . due to the gain of spin - exchange energy in the gutzwiller - projected state , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath1-wave mean - field order is favored away from half filling . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic dome for the off - diagonal order can be reproduced variationally.@xcite low - lying gutzwiller - projected quasiparticle excitations reproduce well many experimental features.@xcite the main disadvantage of the variational approach is that it is a zero - temperature theory and can not easily be extended to finite temperature or to high - energy excitations.@xcite    many years ago , it was noticed that there is a redundant description of gutzwiller - projected fermionic wavefunctions exactly at half filling , parametrized by local su(2 ) rotations.@xcite away from half filling , this redundancy is lifted . </S>",
    "<S> later , wen and lee _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ proposed a slave - boson field theory , where the redundancy is promoted to a dynamical su(2 ) gauge theory away from half filling.@xcite the advantage of the su(2 ) slave - boson approach is that it incorporates strong correlations when gauge fluctuations around the mean - field saddle points are included . </S>",
    "<S> integrating over all gauge - field configurations in this approach enforces the gutzwiller constraint @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the slave - boson mean - field theory is then not restricted to low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the su(2 ) approach to the @xmath0 model predicts that a state with staggered magnetic fluxes through the plaquettes of the square lattice should be close in energy to the @xmath1-wave superconductor at low doping.@xcite in fact , a staggered su(2 ) rotation on nearest - neighbor sites transforms the @xmath1-wave superconductor  ( sc ) into the staggered - flux  ( sf ) state . </S>",
    "<S> these two states are identical at half filling . at small doping , one expects the local symmetry to be weakly broken , and the su(2 ) rotation provides a route to construct a low - lying nonsuperconducting variational state for the weakly doped @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the proposal by wen and lee that the pure sf state should be realized in the vortex cores of htsc.@xcite indeed , it was confirmed numerically that the gutzwiller - projected sf state is a very competitive ground state of the @xmath0 model.@xcite further support for the su(2 ) approach came from the discovery of sf correlations in the gutzwiller - projected @xmath1-wave superconductor.@xcite    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the so - called `` staggered @xmath6-mode '' which interpolates between the sc and the sf states.@xcite as the temperature is increased through @xmath3 in the underdoped compounds , vortices proliferate and eventually destroy the phase coherence . in order to form energetically inexpensive vortices in the superconductor </S>",
    "<S> , the order parameter rotates to the sf state inside the cores.@xcite however , in contrast to vortex cores , we do not expect a pure sf state to be realized in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the pg state should be viewed as a thermal average over different intermediate states between the sf and the sc state , parametrized by appropriate su(2 ) rotations .    in the superconducting phase at low temperature , it is sufficient to include gaussian fluctuations away from the superconducting state . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> honerkamp and lee found that coupling to the gaussian @xmath6-mode strongly depletes the antinodal quasiparticles.@xcite this is in contrast to zero temperature , where gutzwiller - projected excitations show rather weak reduction of spectral weight in the antinodal region as shown by the authors.@xcite at temperatures between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , strong fluctuations toward the sf state are expected to affect the electronic spectral functions even more . in the present work , we are interested in the electron spectral intensities in the pseudogap region , i.e.  in the presence of large fluctuations of the order parameter between the sc and the sf states .    </S>",
    "<S> our model bears some similarity to the @xmath7-model approach for the su(2 ) gauge theory of the @xmath0 model , introduced by lee _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite in contrast to these authors , we do not use a self - consistent mean - field treatment , but we consider an effective model with input from gutzwiller - projected variational wavefunctions of the @xmath0 model .    </S>",
    "<S> a complementary study was conducted by honerkamp and lee who considered su(2 )  fluctuations in an inhomogeneous vortex liquid.@xcite these authors computed the density of states and helicity modulus , and found that a dilute liquid of sf vortices would account for the large nernst signal observed in the pseudogap phase.@xcite in the present paper , we are particularly interested in the implications of the fluctuating - staggered - flux scenario for the arpes spectra .    finally , let us note that our model concerns the low - energy spectra of cuprate superconductors , @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . the interesting high - energy anomalies ( @xmath9 ) which were discovered in recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite works are not in the scope of the current discussion .    </S>",
