    "is given a procedure for constructing cluster - tilted algebras : let @xmath1 be a triangular algebra of global dimension two over an algebraically closed field @xmath2 , and consider the @xmath1-@xmath1-bimodule @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the standard duality , with its natural left and right @xmath1-actions .",
    "the trivial extension of @xmath1 by this bimodule is called the _ relation - extension _ of @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown there that , if @xmath1 is tilted , then its relation - extension is cluster - tilted , and every cluster - tilted algebra occurs in this way .",
    "this relation between tilted and cluster - tilted algebras has been studied further in @xcite .",
    "inspired by the complete slices in the module categories of tilted algebras , the authors introduced the concept of _ local slices _ as a generalization of complete slices , by relaxing a convexity condition .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that every cluster - tilted algebra @xmath5 admits a local slice @xmath6 and that , for every such local slice @xmath6 , the quotient algebra @xmath7 of @xmath5 by the annihilator of @xmath6 is a tilted algebra with complete slice @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , there is a unique component in the auslander - reiten quiver of @xmath5 , called the _ transjective component _ , that contains all local slices .",
    "indecomposable modules in this transjective component are called _",
    "transjective_.    in the module category of a tilted algebra , a complete slice should be thought of as a rather special configuration reproducing the quiver of a hereditary algebra to which our algebra tilts .",
    "it is well - known that an algebra is tilted if and only if it admits a complete slice , see , for instance @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above situation , the existence of a local slice does _ not _ characterize cluster - tilted algebras . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that if the cluster - tilted algebra is of tree type , then _ every _ indecomposable transjective module lies on a local slice . on the other hand , the authors also gave an example of an indecomposable transjective module over a cluster - tilted algebra of type @xmath8 that does _ not _ lie on a local slice .",
    "however , the questions  which indecomposable transjective modules do not lie on local slices \" , and ",
    "how many of these modules do exist \" , remained open .",
    "it is the purpose of the current paper to answer both questions for arbitrary cluster - tilted algebras .",
    "first , we characterize the indecomposable transjective modules that do not lie on a local slice in theorem [ thm ls ] , using the completion of strong sinks defined in @xcite .",
    "then we prove that the number of isoclasses (= isomorphism classes ) of indecomposable transjective modules not lying on local slices is finite , and we actually give a sharp bound for this number in corollary  [ cor 2 ] .",
    "throughout this paper , algebras are basic and connected finite dimensional algebras over a fixed algebraically closed field @xmath2 . for an algebra @xmath5 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the category of finitely generated right @xmath5-modules .",
