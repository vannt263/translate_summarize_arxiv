    "however , unlike the nmssm , the light singlet state decouples to @xmath153 or almost decouples from the mssm fields , in the first case because @xmath13 has no @xmath145 component while in the latter case the coefficient of the trilinear term must be chosen to be very small for phenomenological reasons . in both cases however the existence of the light field causes a phenomenon of amsb non - decoupling , described by pomarol and rattazzi ( pr )  @xcite , which effects the low energy mass spectrum as discussed below .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath156 ( eq .  ( [ eq : spotca ] ) ) .",
    "the vacuum described in section  [ sec : potmin ] clearly generates a higgs @xmath46-term @xmath157 which is naturally of the right order of magnitude .",
    "it also , however , generates a soft breaking higgs @xmath155-term of the form @xmath158 which is too large ; a generic problem with the scenario which has been noticed by a number of authors .",
    "there is , however another weyl invariant operator which generates both @xmath46-term and a @xmath155-term , to wit @xmath159where @xmath160 is the conformal compensator field .",
    "this gives @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "thus we have @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "it is clear that if we proceed to determine @xmath46 and @xmath155 via the electroweak minimisation conditions in the customary way then this amounts to a degree of fine - tuning in order to achieve @xmath165      pr  @xcite propose an ingenious solution to this problem as follows .",
    "they introduce the further contribution to the superpotential @xmath166 the superpotential @xmath167 produces at one loop kinetic mixing of @xmath14 and @xmath168 : @xmath169 the large vev for @xmath14 produces a large supersymmetric mass term for @xmath168 , so that it decouples at low energies and can be eliminated via its equation of motion which for small @xmath170 is @xmath171 giving rise to a contribution to the effective low energy theory of the form @xmath172 and hence via anomaly mediation a contribution to the @xmath17 term @xmath173 and an associated contribution to the @xmath155-term of the form @xmath174 thus one achieves a @xmath155 of the right order of magnitude ( relative to @xmath175 ) .",
    "then if @xmath21 and @xmath22 were sufficently small that the contributions to @xmath155 associated with them were of similar size to @xmath176 then we would have @xmath177 and @xmath178 , so that once more we can determine @xmath179 via electroweak minimisation .",
    "( if we assume that the pr mechanism is the only source of @xmath179 then it is difficult to achieve the electroweak vacuum  @xcite , because eq .  ( eq : prmu ) would mean @xmath17 and @xmath155 were not independent . )",
    "the problem with this scenario is that in order to write down the superpotential @xmath180 we must abandon the @xmath181 symmetry which rendered our theory natural .",
    "this is because the simultaneous presence of the @xmath182 term and the @xmath183 term requires @xmath14 and @xmath168 have the same symmetry properties . as a result",
    "a natural theory would also allow additional terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spotb ] ) of the form @xmath184 and @xmath185 which unfortunately spoil the mechanism proposed by pr .      here",
    "we propose a very simple mechanism which does not involve additional fields to generate the @xmath46 and @xmath155 terms of the correct magnitude in a way consistent with the @xmath186 symmetry .",
    "this is achieved through the case @xmath187 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : spotcb ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath12-breaking proceeds exactly as before and so from eq .",
    "( eq : spotcb ) we obtain a @xmath17-term of the form @xmath188 . since @xmath189 is of order the @xmath12 breaking scale it is therefore necessary to assume that @xmath21 is very small .",
    "we will return to this point presently .",
    "the reason that we can achieve a suitable @xmath155-term is that since @xmath190we can , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : rp ] ) and ( [ eq : rpp ] ) , arrange by making @xmath191 that @xmath192 .",

    "quantitatively we have @xmath196thus we retain naturalness by avoiding the need for cancellation between distinct contributions to @xmath155 .",
    "although we do require two dimensionless couplings ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) to be small this can be achieved by , for example , the froggatt - nielsen mechanism , generating these terms through higher dimension terms suppressed by a large messenger mass .",
    "the existence of a light singlet field , @xmath199 introduces additional contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking terms due to the non - decoupling phenomenon discussed in pr @xcite .",

    "these equations apply in the limit @xmath202 where @xmath203 one sees that the effect of these non - decoupling terms is simply to retain the contributions of the @xmath204 gauge boson to the soft breaking terms even though the @xmath204 gauge coupling freezes out at the breaking scale @xmath205 thus for example we have for the soft @xmath206 coupling , @xmath207 ,    @xmath208    where we have for simplicity retained only the top - quark yukawa coupling .",
