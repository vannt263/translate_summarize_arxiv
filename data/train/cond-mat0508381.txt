    "it is clear by now that hts have many non - conventional physical properties , and they are the reason why the fundamental interaction is yet to be discovered . in some cases it is possible that these unusual properties result from the variation in the average density of holes ( or charge carriers ) @xmath6 in the cuo@xmath8 planes  @xcite .",
    "many experimental features show that the density of charge carriers @xmath6 plays an important role in the physics of the hts .",
    "it is observed that the zero temperature superconducting gap @xmath9 increases when @xmath6 diminishes  @xcite , which is an unexpected behavior since the critical temperature @xmath10 vanishes for low values of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it is also experimentally observed that for some compounds the electrical charges are highly inhomogeneous in the cuo@xmath8 planes  @xcite .",
    "these intrinsic charge inhomogeneities  @xcite are not related to crystal defects .",
    "although it may be not so strong in some cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the inhomogeneity observed in these materials may be related to the fact that the holes injected into the cuo@xmath8 planes by chemical doping may leave behind charged dopant ions  @xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneity may produce regions with spatially varying @xmath11 and a variation in the local density of states ( ldos )  @xcite .",
    "many similar results from scanning tunneling microscopy were reported lately on clean surfaces@xcite . inside the bulk , nuclear quadrupolar resonance ( nqr ) experiments@xcite have also measured that the charge inhomogeneity increases as the temperature decreases , exactly as one expects in a phase separation transition@xcite .",
    "since an inhomogeneous medium does not have translational symmetry , we applied the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) formalism  @xcite , conceived originally to deal with finite systems . to reproduce the intrinsic charge inhomogeneity we consider a nonmagnetic local disorder potential , which has only the effect of changing the local chemical potential on each site of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to obtain a distribution of local superconducting gaps @xmath2 , and a distribution of local density of charge carriers @xmath5 for an entire hts family .",
    "we show that with the same magnitude of the disorder strength , the underdoped compounds become more inhomogeneous than the overdoped ones , which is in accordance with neutron diffraction experiments  @xcite . for the @xmath1-wave gap we observe that for very low disorder strength the distribution of local superconducting gaps gains significant weight near @xmath11=0 and",
    "the distribution of local charge carriers starts to bifurcate .",
    "this behavior differs from the @xmath7-wave gap symmetry distributions  @xcite , which needs higher values of disorder strength to have similar behavior .",
    "to describe the charge carriers dynamics in the cuo@xmath12 planes of the hts we consider an extended hubbard hamiltonian in a square lattice @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the usual fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath15 , with lattice parameter @xmath16=1 and spin @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the density operator , and @xmath19 is the hopping between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the magnitude of the on - site repulsion , and @xmath23 is the magnitude of the nearest - neighbour attractive interaction .",
    "@xmath24 is the chemical potential , and @xmath25 is the magnitude of the local disorder potential at site @xmath20 , defined here as a random independent variable , uniformly distributed over @xmath26 $ ] , similar to what ghosal et al  @xcite made to a s - wave superconductor .",
    "the value of @xmath25 assigned to the site @xmath15 controls the strength of the disorder .",
    "we do not know the origin of @xmath25 , but it is possible to speculate its origin : it can be due to phase segregation , as in the case of la@xmath12cuo@xmath27 , which has been observed to form oxygen rich and poor phases  @xcite , or ion diffusion as observed in microcrystals of bi2212  @xcite .",
    "these findings , together with the nqr experiment of singer et al@xcite , led us argue that is very likely that the upper pseudogap line is the onset of phase separation or bimodal decomposition  @xcite in cuprates superconductors .",
    "however , independently of its origin , the effect of @xmath25 enters in our calculations by the change of the local chemical potential at each site @xmath20 and , as a consequence , the local density of charge carriers @xmath28 , gives rises to the charge inhomogeneity . whether such charge non - uniformity is in form of stripes@xcite is still an open question .",
    "there are many ways of introducing the effects of disorder , for instance , ovchinnikov et al  @xcite considered magnetic impurities and nunner et al .",
    "@xcite assumed a disorder in the pairing strength coupled with @xmath25 .",
    "to apply the bdg theory to the hamiltonian ( [ a ] ) , one may define the pairing amplitudes , or pair potentials  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30=@xmath31@xmath32,@xmath31@xmath33 are unit vectors for a square lattice . in the mean - field theory eq.([a ] ) can be solved using these pairing amplitudes .",

    "the oscillations of the theoretical curves in fig.[fig0 ] are associated with the number of hopping integrals : to embrace the entire range where the superconductivity of lsco exists , it was necessary to consider hopping integrals from the first to the fourth neighbour , which generates the oscillations in the @xmath9 @xmath68 @xmath6 phase diagram .    to study the disorder effects , with the same coupling parameters and hopping integrals used in the homogeneous case , we calculate the distributions of local @xmath1-wave superconducting gaps @xmath76 $ ] and local hole densities @xmath67 $ ] . in fig.[fig2 ] we plot @xmath76 $ ] for the @xmath77=0.15 compound .",

    ", for @xmath4=0.045@xmath56 the disorder generates a distribution of @xmath11 around the average gap value @xmath9 . as we have already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the maximum local gap is measured in the tunneling experiments and it seems to increase with the level of inhomogeneity@xcite . from fig.[fig2 ] we see that , indeed , the disorder spreads the distribution @xmath66 $ ] , what increases the maximum local superconducting gap . since the experimental leading edge shift , interpreted as the magnitude of the superconducting gap  @xcite , increases dramatically in the underdoped region , we can speculate that this is possibly the result of the inhomogeneity in the cuo@xmath12 planes of the underdoped compounds .",

    "we can see in fig.[figa2 ] that , as the average density @xmath6 increases , rms.rel diminishes , i.e. , the range over which the superconducting gap @xmath9 is distributed also diminishes , which indicates again that as @xmath6 goes into the overdoped region , the compounds become more homogeneous .    in fig.[fig5 ]",
    "we show the spatial variation map of @xmath11 , in the 22@xmath8122 lattice , for three different compounds for a particular realization of the random potential ( @xmath4=0.10@xmath56 ) : in fig.[fig5]a we have the near - optimum compound ( @xmath6=0.15 ) , and in fig.[fig5]b and c , we have two overdoped compounds , @xmath6=0.20 and 0.30 , respectively . in the figures the light regions corresponds to high local superconducting gaps , and",

    "we observe the coexistence of light regions and dark regions , indicating a high inhomogeneous regime . as the density increases ,",
    "most of the regions become darker , indicating a more homogeneous medium .",
    "therefore , we conclude again from the figures that , as the density @xmath6 increases , the systems tend to become more homogeneous , in agreement with fig.[fig4 ] . what means that a d - wave superconductor becomes more homogeneous as the concentration of holes or doping level increases .",

    "the random potential @xmath4 , within a bdg formalism , was considered as the effect of the electronic inhomogeneity produced by the dopants .",
    "the results demonstrated that , for particular values of the coupling parameters and hopping integrals , the decay of @xmath9 as @xmath6 increases , can be reproduced with this local calculation .",

    "furthermore , with all parameters fixed but the average density , the underdoped compounds have a clear tendency to be more inhomogeneous than the overdoped ones , which is in agreement with experimental findings  @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig5 ] , the spatial variation of local superconducting gaps exhibits regions of high @xmath11 enclosed by low @xmath11 regions , which favours the possibility that the superconducting phase is reached by the percolation of many superconducting patches or stripes  @xcite .",
