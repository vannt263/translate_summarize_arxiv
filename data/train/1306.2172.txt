    "@xmath0  cm signal ] against a background of the cosmic microwave background is a promising tracer of the cosmic dark ages , cosmic dawn , and the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "detecting the spatial fluctuations of @xmath0  cm brightness requires many hundreds of hours of integration with large radio synthesis telescopes , owing to its faintness as compared to galactic and extragalactic foregrounds @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the sky averaged @xmath0  cm brightness also called the global signal , is bright enough to be measured within a day s worth of integration based on a signal to noise ratio argument @xcite . since the received frequency of redshifted @xmath0  cm photons corresponds to cosmic redshift , accurately estimating the sky averaged brightness temperature as a function of frequency will provide insights into the evolution of hi during the dark ages , cosmic dawn , and the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "+ thermal uncertainties are not the limiting factor in global @xmath0  cm experiments , and spectral contamination due to systematic artifacts have impeded a reliable detection thus far @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the signal in such experiments is the variation of @xmath0  cm brightness temperature with frequency , any instrumental or observational systematic that affects the measured bandpass power poses a severe limitation .",
    "these systematics are especially limiting since the foregrounds are @xmath10 orders of magnitude larger than the expected @xmath0  cm signal .",
    "consequently , measuring the @xmath0  cm signal spectrum requires precise understanding of frequency dependent effects of instrumental gain , instrumental noise contribution , antenna beam shape , and ionospheric effects , coupled with spatially and spectrally varying foregrounds ( galactic and extragalactic ) .",
    "the effects of these parameters are not always mutually separable , further complicating calibration and signal extraction efforts .",
    "+ ongoing global @xmath0  cm experiments have primarily focused on frequencies ranging from @xmath11  mhz to @xmath12  mhz ( @xmath13)@xcite . dark ages and cosmic dawn experiments at lower frequencies are being planned , or are being commissioned dark ages radio explorer ( dare ) @xcite , large - aperture experiment to detect the dark ages @xcite , and broadband instrument for the global hydrogen reionization signal ( bighorns ) experiment @xcite , among others .",
    "global @xmath0  cm work especially in the lower frequency band requires a strict assessment of systematic chromatic corruptions .",
    "the reasons for this are threefold .",
    "( i ) firstly , the magnitude of ionospheric effects such as refraction and absorption increase rapidly with decreasing frequency .",
    "( ii ) secondly , galactic foreground brightness temperatures increase with decreasing frequency as a power law with a relatively steep spectral index of about @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , any systematic corruptions which are multiplicative , which many of the ones in such experiments are , may undermine @xmath0  cm signal detection efforts more severely at lower frequencies .",
    "( iii ) finally , the increased fractional bandwidth in the lower frequency band leads to an increased variation of antenna beams across the measurement bandwidth , giving larger chromatic effects .",
    "+ receiver gain and noise temperature may be calibrated by switching the receiver between the sky and known man - made noise sources .",
    "such techniques have been demonstrated with moderate success in global @xmath0  cm experiments @xcite .",
    "however , little attention has been paid in the literature to chromatic ( frequency dependent ) antenna beam and ionospheric effects .",
    "these effects have thus far been assumed to be ` spectrally smooth ' and possibly fitted away along with the foregrounds .",
    "they have thus escaped qualitative and quantitative treatment one of the primary aims of this paper .",
    "+ chromatic effects must be studied in conjunction with algorithms that are used to separate the measured sky spectrum into foregrounds and the @xmath0  cm signal . due to the lack of sufficiently accurate foreground models at these frequencies , such algorithms must rely on some priors on the differential properties of foregrounds and the @xmath0  cm signal . these algorithms typically exploit ( i ) the spectral smoothness of power - law - like foregrounds in comparison to less smooth structure expected in the @xmath0  cm signal , and/or ( ii ) the angular structure of foregrounds as opposed to isotropic nature of the global @xmath0  cm signal . spectral smoothness of foregrounds may be exploited by casting the measured sky spectrum in a basis where foregrounds have a sparse representation unlike the @xmath0  cm signal .",
    "we may call such techniques spectral - basis methods , since they only use spectral smoothness as a prior .",
    "one such basis set suggested in literature , which we will call ` logpolyfit ` , uses polynomials in logarithmic space as basis to represent the time averaged spectrum @xcite . exploiting priors on the angular structure of foregrounds for global @xmath0  cm experiments",
    "has not received due attention in literature , save a recent effort by @xcite , who in light of their simulations , recommend measurements with an angular resolution of @xmath10  degrees .",
    "practical implications of a narrow beam ( highly chromatic sidelobes etc . ) remain to be evaluated .",
    "moreover , ongoing and proposed global @xmath0  cm experiments have near - hemisphere fields of view and lack any meaningful angular resolution .",
    "it is then instructive to place limits on the extent to which beam and ionospheric chromatic effects can confuse @xmath0  cm signatures in the context of spectral - basis algorithms another primary aim of this paper .",
    "+ in this paper , we simulate the contribution of foregrounds ( with chromatic effects ) to the measured antenna temperature and evaluate an optimal set of basis functions for a sparse representation of foregrounds . by casting the foregrounds and the expected @xmath0  cm signal in this basis",
    ", we place limits on the amount of @xmath0  cm signal power that will be lost to foreground confusion in any spectral - basis technique .",
    "since the optimal basis functions are not known apriori in real measurements , we may resort to predefined analytic basis functions such as polynomials . in this paper , we show that polynomials in logarithmic space ( ` logpolyfit ` ) are incapable of even detecting the presence of a template @xmath0  cm signal in simulated data in the frequency range of @xmath1  mhz to @xmath15  mhz .",
    "+ in this paper , we propose an alternative spectral - basis method which we call ` svdfit ` , that evaluates a suitable basis using the measured data itself . despite hemispherical fields of view of ongoing experiments , earth rotation couples angular structure of the foregrounds into the time domain , while the global @xmath0  cm signal being isotropic ,",
    "has no temporal structure . `",
    "svdfit ` uses the time variable component of the measured dynamic spectra to compute an efficient basis in which the foregrounds and chromatic effects have a sparse representation , but not the @xmath0  cm signal itself .",
    "we will show that a ` svdfit ` is better than ` logpolyfit ` in ascertaining the presence of a template @xmath0  cm signal in our simulated data .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that for complete reconstruction of the @xmath0  cm signal spectrum , spectral smoothness is an inadequate prior in the above frequency range , and ultimately extracting the @xmath0  cm signal spectrum will require modeling of the foregrounds , antenna beam , and ionospheric effects via a full measurement equation .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "details of the simulations used herein are described in section [ sec : simu ] . in section [ sec : iono ] we describe our two - layered ionospheric model ( f- and d - layers ) .",
    "we derive approximate expressions for chromatic effects from these two layers , and also quantify the level at which we expect these effects .",
    "in section [ sec : chrom ] we use the results of our simulations to compute an optimal basis to represent the foreground induced antenna temperature , and quantify the extent to which foregrounds and chromatic effects confuse the @xmath0  cm signatures in spectral - basis methods .",
    "we then describe a novel foreground removal technique which we call ` svdfit ` , and also evaluate the efficiency with which ` logpolyfit ` and ` svdfit ` remove foregrounds and chromatic effects . finally in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we draw conclusions and recommendations for future work .",
    "this section describes the simulations used in this paper . we assume perfect bandpass calibration of receiver gain and receiver noise .",
    "we will discuss bandpass calibration in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we also assume that the antenna beam does not vary with time .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since a dipole beam is a function of its mechanical shape , and hence , we do not expect noticeable variations in the antenna beam so long as the dielectric environment of the antenna does not change considerably .",
    "we build our simulations from smaller modules , each incorporating a different stage of signal corruption .",
    "the end result of our simulations is a dynamic spectrum measuring sky brightness temperature as a function of time and frequency .",
    "the following enumeration along with figure [ fig : simu ] describe the parameters in our modular simulations .        1 .   _ location _ : we assume the observation location to be one of the lofar stations ( de602 ) near munich , germany , for which we have data in hand .",
    "the de602 station is built on slightly sloping land .",
    "we assume the latitude and longitude of observations ( @xmath16n , @xmath17e ) to be that point on the locally flat ellipsoid which ` sees ' the same sky as de602 at any instant of time . though this corresponding point and de602 have slightly different horizons , we discount this fact since we are primarily concerned with the chromatic effects of the beam and ionosphere in this paper .",
    "sky model _ : our simulations can use either of two sky models : ( i ) the @xmath18  mhz all sky map by @xcite scaled with a global temperature spectral index of @xmath14 , or ( ii ) the all - sky model by @xcite that is a linear combination of observations at different frequencies .",
    "while the second sky - model presents a more realistic scenario , we use the first sky model as a reference model to study the spectral nature of chromatic effects due to the ionosphere , lofar lba dipole beam , and the foreground itself .",
    "_ antenna beam _ : to study the effects of the chromatic lofar lba dipole beam while facilitating comparison with previous work , we present simulations with two beams : ( i ) a frequency independent @xmath19 beam ( @xmath20 is the zenith angle ) considered by @xcite in their simulations , and ( ii ) a realistic frequency dependent lofar lba beam obtained from electromagnetic simulations of the antenna geometry including the finite ground - plane ( see figure [ fig : lba_pattern ] ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of the antenna beam results in the sky being weighed differently at different frequencies and hence couples spatial structure on the sky into the frequency domain .",
    "+ +    4 .   _",
    "@xmath0  cm signal _ : the main feature of the global @xmath0  cm signal expected in the @xmath1  mhz to @xmath15  mhz range is a relatively broad absorption feature @xcite @xcite . since we do not address a full signal reconstruction here , we approximate this absorption feature as a negative gaussian centered at about @xmath21  mhz , with fwhm of @xmath22  mhz . spatial fluctuations of the signal are expected to be on small angular - scales ( @xmath23  degree ) , and are averaged away by the broad dipole beam .",
    "recent work has shown that relative velocity between baryons and dark matter may imprint fluctuations on the observed @xmath0  cm brightness on @xmath24  mpc scales @xcite , that correspond to several degrees in the sky .",
    "however , single dipoles typically have fields of view spanning several tens of degrees , and hence , we safely ignore any observable brightness fluctuations in the @xmath0  cm signal .",
    "_ ionospheric model _ : ionospheric effects may be divided into static effects and dynamic effects .",
    "dynamic effects include time variant phenomenon such as ( i ) scintillation induced by turbulence in the ionospheric plasma @xcite , and ( ii ) refraction from large scale traveling ionospheric disturbances @xcite .",
    "while we expect these effects to average away for long integration time scales , there has not been a comprehensive study thus far on their effects on global @xmath0  cm experiments , and we defer a discussion on these effects to a future paper . in this paper , we only study static ionospheric refraction and absorption . in section [ sec : iono ] , we describe these static effects in detail . in particular , we show in section [ sec : iono ] that a static ionosphere causes ( i ) frequency dependent deviation of incoming electromagnetic rays ( chromatic refraction ) which we model by ` stretching ' the antenna beam accordingly , and ( ii ) frequency and direction dependent absorption due to electron collision with air molecules which we model as a multiplicative loss factor on the antenna beam .",
    "these two effects , when applied on the fiducial antenna beam , give us an effective antenna beam which we use to compute the observed dynamic spectra .",
    "_ gridding and computation _ : the sky temperature at a given time and frequency is computed by pixel wise multiplication of the sky model and the effective antenna beam , followed by integration of this product over all pixels while taking their solid angle into account . for a given epoch @xmath25 , and frequency @xmath26 , this computation may be represented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the simulated antenna temperature , @xmath29 is the sky brightness temperature ( sky model ) which is a function of zenith angle @xmath20 and azimuth angle @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the antenna beam as a function of frequency and sky position .",
    "note that due to earth rotation , @xmath29 changes with time . as mentioned before ,",
    "ionospheric effects may be absorbed into the beam term , and if the beam in equation ( [ eqn : mmeq ] ) is replaced by an effective beam @xmath32 , then equation ( [ eqn : mmeq ] ) is the measurement equation which describes the computations in our simulation .",
    "+ usually , the antenna beam and the sky model are specified in different co - ordinate systems , and have to be brought to a common grid to numerically compute a discretized form of equation ( [ eqn : mmeq ] ) .",
    "it is easier to re - grid and interpolate a smoothly varying antenna beam as opposed to the global sky model that has more complex structure due to the galactic disk and point - like sources .",
    "we thus work in the co - ordinate system of the sky model ( ra , dec ) and interpolate the effective antenna beams at each frequency and time epoch to the sky grid .",
    "an example sky model , antenna beam , and ionospheric refraction induced deviation angle on the sky grid is shown in figure [ fig : simu ] for a single frequency channel at a sidereal time of @xmath33h@xmath33m@xmath33s . for different values of sidereal time",
    ", the effective beam will be shifted along the right ascension axis .",
    "the end product of the simulations is a dynamic spectrum ( @xmath34 from equation [ eqn : mmeq ] ) in time - frequency domain .",
    "an example dynamic spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : typical_spectrum ] .",

    "this section describes the static model we use for the ionosphere in greater detail , and the origin and nature of chromatic refraction and absorption .",
    "the bulk of refraction and absorption occur at two separate layers of the ionosphere the f - layer and the d - layer respectively .",
    "we thus evaluate two refractive index values for typical conditions in these two layers , and then use the earth - ionosphere geometry to compute the refractive ray deviation and the absorptive loss factor for different frequencies and directions .",
    "the ionosphere is a magnetized plasma whose complex refractive index is given by the appleton - hartree equation @xcite that relates the refractive index to the electron density , magnetic field , and the geometry of wave propagation .",
    "we computed the change in refractive index due to the earths magnetic field to be less than @xmath35 part in @xmath36 for the f - layer and less than @xmath37 percent for the d - layer .",
    "we ignore this effect since it is smaller than the refractive index variations induced by day to day changes in ionospheric electron density , and we present results for a broad range of electron densities .",
    "additionally , the change in refractive index due to a magnetic field is different for left - hand and right - hand circularly polarized radiation , and results in an effect called faraday rotation . in this paper , we ignore faraday rotation by assuming the sky to be unpolarized on scales comparable to our antenna beam .",
    "we thus model the ionospheric refractive index using a simplified form of the appleton - hartree equation that does not include the magnetic field term : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron plasma frequency , and @xmath40 is the electron collision frequency",
    ". the electric field of a plane wave traveling in a homogeneous ionospheric layer is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the speed of light in free - space , and @xmath43 is the distance measured along the direction of propagation in the ionosphere .",
    "+ the real part of the refractive index @xmath44 is mostly sensitive to the electron density , and causes a change in the phase velocity ( from that in free space ) resulting in refraction . the imaginary part of @xmath44 ( negative in our case ) is mostly sensitive to the electron collision rate that in turn depends on the electron density , atmospheric gas density , and temperature .",
    "the imaginary part exponentially dampens the wave amplitude causing absorption .",
    "+ due to its low atmospheric gas density ( giving a low collision rate ) and high electron density , we model the f - layer with a real , frequency dependent refractive index @xmath45 , to account for ionospheric refraction . due to its high atmospheric gas density ( giving a high collision rate ) and low electron density , we model the d - layer with an imaginary , frequency dependent refractive index ( @xmath46 ) to account for ionospheric absorption .",
    "+ we expect most of the global @xmath0  cm observations to take place during night - time when ionospheric electron density is at its lowest . additionally , this avoids the need to model the complex and time - variant spectrum of the sun as a foreground source .",
    "we will thus assume values for a typical mid - latitude night - time ionosphere in the absence of intense solar activity .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and references therein from which we have drawn parameter values for typical ionospheric f- and d - layer conditions .",
    "the following subsections compute the refractive and absorptive effects of such an ionosphere .",
    "most of the ionospheric electron column density is accounted for by the f - layer that extends between a height of @xmath47  km and @xmath48  km from the earth s surface . the electron density outside of this layer",
    "is known to fall off rapidly .",
    "though the electron density does vary within the f - layer , to first order , we model the f - layer as a homogeneous shell between the heights of @xmath49  km and @xmath50  km .",
    "we assume a constant electron density of @xmath51  m@xmath52 which gives a typical mid - latitude electron column density of @xmath53  tec units tec units equals a column density of @xmath54 electrons per m@xmath55 .",
    "ionospheric tec is routinely monitored by measuring the propagation delay in gps signals .",

    "this value is typical of winter - time in mid - latitudes where lofar is situated .",
    "tec values are typically higher ( i ) during daytime , ( ii ) closer to the equator , and ( iii ) during summer . additionally , ionospheric tec is sensitive to solar and sunspot activity . due to the above reasons , we will also present results for higher tec values .",
    "+    ]    figure [ fig : refrac_illus ] depicts the refractive effect of the ionospheric f - layer .",
    "any incoming ray suffers snell s refraction at the upper and lower boundaries of the f - layer .",
    "if the earth were flat , there would be no net deviation in the ray .",
    "due to the curvature of the earth ( and hence the ionosphere ) there is a net deviation @xmath56 .",
    "this deviation is zero for a source at zenith , and increases as we move towards the horizon .",
    "hence , the ionosphere acts like a spherical ` lens ' that deviates incoming rays towards zenith . since the ionospheric refractive index is a strong function of frequency , @xmath56 is also a function of frequency .",
    "consequently , the ionosphere is a chromatic lens .",
    "figure [ fig : refrac_illus ] also depicts a horizon ray that marks the radio horizon , that is below the geometric horizon .",
    "this radio horizon is different at different frequencies .",
    "this chromatic lensing of the sky due to ionospheric refraction is an important effect for global @xmath0  cm experiments that use dipoles with near hemispherical fields of view .",
    "+ it is difficult to derive a closed form expression for @xmath57 , and hence we compute it numerically by applying snell s law at the two interfaces .",
    "nevertheless , we may use an analytical approximation to study the dependency of @xmath58 , on @xmath20 and @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mean height of the f - layer ( @xmath61  km in our case ) and @xmath62 is the radius of the earth which we assume to be @xmath63  km .",

    "these curves are obtained from simple ray tracing and not from equation ( [ eqn : devangle ] ) .",
    "the curves approximately follow a @xmath7 dependence as expected .",
    "we also use the value of @xmath56 for the horizon ray ( see figure [ fig : refrac_illus ] ) to compute the percentage increase in visible sky area as compared to the geometric horizon for each frequency .",
    "this percentage is also plotted in figure [ fig : devangle ] , and is not only frequency dependent , but also of the order of a few percent even for favorable ionospheric conditions .",
    "since the foregrounds are @xmath66 orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath0  cm signal , a frequency dependent additional sky area of a few percent adds an amount of power which is @xmath67 orders of magnitude higher than the expected @xmath0  cm signal .",
    "hence , it is important to consider the chromatic effects of ionospheric refraction at the horizon and rapidly decreasing as we move towards zenith @xcite .",
    "however this refraction is expected to be non - chromatic @xcite and hence , we disregard it for the purposes of this paper . ] .",
    "+ the refractive lensing effect of the ionosphere may be absorbed into the antenna beam .",
    "we do this by ` stretching ' the antenna beam by an amount @xmath56 to form an effective beam that now includes the effects of chromatic f - layer refraction .",
    "if the antenna beam is represented as @xmath68 , then the new effective antenna beam may be represented as @xmath69 which gives the instantaneous measured antenna temperature of @xmath70 note that the effective beam does not integrate to unity like the original antenna beam .",
    "it integrates to a value larger than unity due to the additional sky area added by refraction of sub - horizon rays into the original antenna beam .",
    "since the dipole beam is ` stretched ' by an amount equal to @xmath56 which is a strong function of frequency , the sky is weighted differently at different frequencies in equation ( [ eqn : mmeq ] ) .",
    "this couples spatial structure in the sky to frequency structure in the measured antenna temperature spectrum .",
    "it is important to note that this chromatic mixing happens even if the original antenna beam itself is frequency independent .",
    "+ finally , we quantify the approximate extent and nature of chromatic refraction by considering a simple case where ( i ) the sky brightness temperature is a power law with the same spectral index @xmath71 everywhere ( @xmath72 ) , and ( ii ) the original antenna beam is frequency independent and is given by @xmath73 . the effective antenna beam ( due to chromatic refraction ) is then given by @xmath74 which on taylor - expansion about @xmath20 gives @xmath75 note that the effective beam is now chromatic , while the original antenna beam is not .",

    "we find that the antenna temperature evaluates to the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are independent of frequency , and depend only on the sky brightness , antenna beam , and geometric terms . equation ( [ eqn : f_final ] ) shows that chromatic refraction will add a new component to the original @xmath82 sky brightness temperature .",

    "the chromatic foregrounds can now be fit away by the basis functions @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "however , since the sky brightness and the lofar lba beam are both more complicated , we will resort to more realistic simulations in section [ sec : chrom ] to accurately evaluate the nature and extent of chromatic refraction .",

    "<S> lofar s low band antennas ( lba ) may be used in the frequency range @xmath1  mhz to @xmath2  mhz ( @xmath3 ) to measure the sky averaged redshifted @xmath0  cm brightness temperature as a function of frequency , or equivalently , cosmic redshift . </S>",
    "<S> these low frequencies are affected by strong galactic foreground emission that is observed through frequency dependent ionospheric and antenna beam distortions which lead to chromatic mixing of spatial structure into spectral structure . </S>",
    "<S> using simple models , we show that ( i ) the additional antenna temperature due to ionospheric refraction and absorption are at a @xmath4% level @xmath5 to @xmath6 orders of magnitude higher than the expected @xmath0  cm signal , and have an approximate @xmath7 dependence , ( ii ) ionospheric refraction leads to a knee - like modulation on the sky spectrum at @xmath8plasma frequency . using more realistic simulations , we show that in the measured sky spectrum , more than @xmath9% of the @xmath0  cm signal variance can be lost to confusion from foregrounds and chromatic effects . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that foregrounds and chromatic mixing may not be subtracted as generic functions of frequency as previously thought , but must rather be carefully modeled using additional priors and interferometric measurements .    </S>",
