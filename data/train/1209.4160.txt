    "given a bounded open convex subset @xmath0 of a euclidean space , d. hilbert proposed in @xcite ( 1895 ) a natural metric @xmath4 on @xmath0 , now called the _",
    "hilbert metric_. it is defined for @xmath5 in @xmath0 as the logarithm of the cross ratio of the quadruple @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the point where the ray from @xmath8 through @xmath9 hits the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "this defines a metric on @xmath0 , which is finslerian and projective .",
    "we recall that a finslerian metric on @xmath0 ( or , more generally , on a differentiable manifold ) is determined by a norm on each tangent space in such a way that the distance between two point in @xmath0 is equal to the infimum of lengths of paths joining them , where the length of a path is computed by integrating along it the norms of vectors tangent to this path .",
    "this norm function is usually called the _ minkowski functional _ of the metric .",
    "we also recall that a metric on a subset of euclidean space is said to be projective if euclidean straight lines are geodesics for that metric .",
    "the open unit disc in @xmath3 equipped with its hilbert metric @xmath10 is a prominent example of a projective metric , since it is klein s model of hyperbolic @xmath11-space , and it was the motivating example for hilbert when he defined his metric for more general convex sets .",
    "the value @xmath10 of the hilbert metric on @xmath0 can be written , for @xmath5 , as @xmath12    p. funk  @xcite looked at the first term of the right hand side of the above equation as a kind of metric , even though it is not symmetric in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is now called the _",
    "funk metric_. the reader is referred to funk s paper @xcite and to the papers @xcite for some historical and technical background on the funk metric .",
    "more generally , given a set @xmath13 , we can consider functions @xmath14 satisfying the following two properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath15 for all @xmath8 in @xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath16 for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath13 .    in @xcite ,",
    "such a function @xmath19 is named _ weak metric_. note that in this definition neither the symmetry @xmath20 nor the nondegeneracy @xmath21 are assumed .",
    "a weak metric may be finslerian in the sense that it is induced by a _",
    "weak norm _ on each tangent space in the same way as a genuine metric can be finslerian . here ,",
    "a _ weak norm _ on a vector space is a function @xmath22 satisfying    1 .",
    "@xmath23 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath22 is convex .    for brevity , we shall call a weak metric a _",
    "metric _ , and when such a function does or does not satisfy the other axioms satisfied by a metric , we shall mention it explicitly whenever this is needed .",
    "we recall that hilbert s fourth problem from the collection of mathematical problems he presented in 1900 at the second international congress of mathematicians in paris , is entitled :  problem of the straight line as the shortest distance between two points . \"",
    "hilbert elaborates on this statement in @xcite , and he also places the problem in a historical perspective .",
    "mathematicians however agree on the fact that hilbert s formulation of the problem is rather vague , which makes this problem ( like several others in hilbert s collection ) , admit several different precise formulations and therefore several possible solutions .",
    "a possible ( and probably the most common ) formulation of that problem is in two parts , as follows : ( 1 ) to characterize the metrics on subsets of euclidean space for which the euclidean straight lines are geodesics , and ( 2 ) to study such metrics individually .",
    "( we note by the way that the axioms of a metric space as we intend it today had not been formulated at the time hilbert proposed his problems ; they were given later on by maurice frchet in his thesis ( 1907 ) . )",
    "herbert busemann , who spent much of his career engaged with that problem , gave it the following formulation ( see @xcite ) , which is close to the one we gave above : ",
    "the fourth problem concerns the geometries in which the ordinary lines , i.e. lines of an n - dimensional ( real ) projective space @xmath24 or pieces of them are the shortest curves or geodesics .",
    "specifically , hilbert asks for the construction of these metrics and the study of the individual geometries . \"",
    "for the funk and the hilbert metrics in hyperbolic and in spherical geometry , we shall see the non - euclidean geodesics are geodesics for these metrics .",
    "it is then natural to address the question of considering hilbert problem iv in these non - euclidean settings , that is , the problem of characterizing and of studying individually the metrics on subsets of the sphere and on subsets of hyperbolic space for which the spherical and the hyperbolic straight lines respectively are geodesics .",
    "we shall see that these problems amount to the euclidean problem .",
    "a related fact is that despite of the lack of linear structure in the hyperbolic and spherical geometries , when it comes to the geometry of hilbert metrics , one can still capture the projective geometry and the so - called incidence geometry in a manner almost identical to the one in the euclidean situation , from the viewpoint of convex geometry .",
    "we further remark that the projective structure only appears in the geometry of hilbert metrics , and not in that of funk metrics .",
    "the authors would like to thank norbert acampo for sharing his enthusiasm and ideas .",
    "first we collect some known facts about the funk and hilbert metrics defined on convex subsets of euclidean spaces .",
    "we set the presentation in @xcite as our reference for the funk and hilbert metrics , and we also refer to the first part of the paper @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be an open convex subset of euclidean space @xmath3 .",
    "note that we allow @xmath0 to be unbounded .",
    "there are three different descriptions of the funk metric .",
    "the first one is the original definition which we already referred to : @xmath25 for @xmath5 in @xmath0 , the point @xmath26 being the intersection point of the euclidean ray @xmath27 from @xmath8 though @xmath9 with the boundary @xmath28 when such an intersection point exists , @xmath29 being the unit tangent vector in @xmath3 pointing from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . in the case where the euclidean ray @xmath27 is contained in @xmath0 ( and therefore does not intersect the boundary ) , we set the distance @xmath30 to be 0 .",
    "this makes the function @xmath31 defined on the whole set @xmath32 and continuous with respect to the topology of @xmath3 .",
    "the second description is the variational interpretation of the above value using the geometry of supporting hyperplanes ; we set : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the set of all supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 .",
    "this is given in @xcite .",
    "in the literature , a variational characterization of hilbert metrics appears in the work of nussbaum ( @xcite , 1988 ) , where the supporting hyperplanes are treated as the elements of the dual space ; note that the funk metric was not mentioned in that work .",
    "finally , the finsler structure @xmath35 of the funk metric is given by the following function ( the minkowski functional ) on vectors @xmath36 at each tangent space to @xmath0 at @xmath8 : @xmath37 this is a weak norm on each tangent space which is defined so that the funk distance is described as the infimum of lengths of curves : @xmath38 the infimum being taken over the piecewise @xmath39-curves @xmath40 in @xmath0 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we emphasize that for a convex domain @xmath43 , the three quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are all equal to each other , and we set @xmath47 for every @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath0 .    the aim of this paper is to consider funk - like metrics in non - euclidean geometries : hyperbolic and spherical .",
    "formally , the exposition is very similar in the two cases",
    ". we shall first give an exposition of the theory in the case of the @xmath11-dimensional hyperbolic space and we shall then mention the changes needed for the case of spherical geometry .",
    "given an open convex set @xmath0 in @xmath48 , we shall define a funk - type metric ( which we shall call the _ funk metric _ of @xmath0 ) , and provide three descriptions of it corresponding to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the euclidean funk metric case .",
    "we shall also study the geodesics of this metric .",
    "we recall that a path @xmath52 \\rightarrow ( x , d)$ ] in a metric space @xmath53 is said to be geodesic when for any @xmath54 , the equality @xmath55 is satisfied .",
    "we start by representing the convex set @xmath0 as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ( open ) half space bounded by a totally geodesic hyperplane touching @xmath58 at the boundary point @xmath59 and containing the convex set @xmath58 . in analogy with the euclidean situation , we call these submanifolds _ supporting hyperplanes _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the index set @xmath34 is the set of all supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 .",
    "that for every boundary point @xmath60 there exists a supporting hyperplane @xmath61 follows from the definition of convexity of @xmath0 . in general , there can be more than one supporting hyperplane of @xmath0 at @xmath62 . for later use ,",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the set of supporting hyperplanes at @xmath64 .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the hyperbolic metric in @xmath2 .",
    "+ given two distinct points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a convex set @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath66 the geodesic ray starting at @xmath8 and passing through @xmath9 and where , as in the euclidean case , @xmath29 is the unit tangent vector at @xmath8 of the arc - length parameterized geodesic in @xmath2 connecting @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "[ d : funk - h ] for a pair of points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath67 , the funk ( asymmetric ) distance from @xmath8 to @xmath9 is defined by @xmath68 where the point @xmath26 is the intersection with the boundary @xmath28 of the hyperbolic geodesic ray @xmath69 from @xmath8 though @xmath9 .",
    "we shall see below that the function @xmath70 satisfies indeed the triangle inequality .",
    "we will consider only the case where the ray @xmath69 is not contained in @xmath0 .",
    "the other case can be dealt with easily .",
    "we first recall a classical trigonometric identity on the hyperbolic plane @xmath71 . for a given hyperbolic right triangle @xmath72 with angles",
    "@xmath73 with @xmath74 and with side lengths @xmath75 and @xmath76 opposite to the vertices @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , we have @xmath79 the formula is a special case of the sine rule which is recalled in the appendix .    note that a euclidean right triangle with corresponding labelling would satisfy @xmath80 and we have here an instance of a correspondence which often occurs between the euclidean and the hyperbolic trigonometric formulae where the hyperbolic formulae are obtained by replacing the side lengths by the hyperbolic sines of these lengths , and similar transformations .",
    "( see as an example the sine rule in the appendix . )",
    "choosing a point @xmath81 on the side @xmath76 and letting @xmath82 be its nearest point projection on the side @xmath83 , we have another right triangle @xmath84 with angles @xmath85 , with @xmath86 , and with side lengths @xmath87 opposite to the vertices @xmath88 and @xmath82 respectively , satisfying @xmath89 as the ratios @xmath90 and @xmath91 are equal to @xmath92 , we shall say that the two triangles @xmath72 and @xmath84 are _ similar _ with the side lengths being weighted by the @xmath93 function .",
    "we now let @xmath94 be a supporting hyperplane for @xmath0 at @xmath26 , namely , @xmath95 .",
    "we note the similarity ( in the above sense ) between the right triangles @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the foot of the point @xmath60 on the hyperplane @xmath94 , or , putting it differently , where @xmath99 is the nearest point projection map .",
    "the two triangles @xmath96 and @xmath97 lie in a hyperbolic plane @xmath71 isometrically embedded in @xmath48 which is uniquely determined by the three points @xmath100 it contains .",
    "thus , we have @xmath101 by the above similarity property of triangles , the right hand side of the equality is independent of the choice of @xmath94 in @xmath102 .",
    "now by the convexity of @xmath0 , the quantity @xmath103 in definition [ d : funk - h ] can be characterized variationally as follows .",
    "define @xmath104 by @xmath105 with @xmath106 . consider the case @xmath107 .",
    "when the hyperplane @xmath108 supports @xmath0 at @xmath7 , we have @xmath109 and otherwise ( when @xmath110 ) the point @xmath111 lies outside @xmath0 . when @xmath112 , by the similarity property between the triangles @xmath113 and @xmath114 again , we have @xmath115 note that the closest point to @xmath8 along the ray @xmath116 of the form @xmath117 is @xmath7 .",
    "this in turn says that a hyperplane @xmath108 which supports @xmath0 at @xmath26 maximizes the ratio @xmath118 among all the elements of @xmath119 ; that is ,    @xmath120    hence we have the following characterization of the funk metric @xmath70 for @xmath67 :    the funk metric on a convex subset @xmath67 has the following variational formulation : @xmath121    with this formulation , one can readily see that @xmath103 satisfies the triangle inequality , for @xmath122    note that the triangle inequality becomes an equality when @xmath123 is satisfied . for this to occur , we only need to have @xmath124 . indeed , let @xmath94 be an element of the set @xmath124 . then the boundary points @xmath26 and @xmath125 share the same supporting hyperplane @xmath94 , and therefore @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128 inducing the equality",
    ". the observation is summarized as in the following proposition . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath0 ,",
    "we denote , as before , by @xmath129 the geodesic ray starting at @xmath8 and passing through @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath0 be an open convex subset of @xmath130 such that @xmath28 contains some hyperbolic geodesic segment @xmath131 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb h}^2 $ ] which we denote by @xmath132 and let @xmath8 and @xmath18 be two distinct points in @xmath0 such that @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath134 be the intersection of @xmath0 with the hyperbolic plane @xmath71 in @xmath48 containing @xmath135 .",
    "then , for any point @xmath9 in @xmath134 satisfying @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 .    a notable situation when one has @xmath124 is when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are collinear , meaning that they lie on a common geodesic , with @xmath9 lying between @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "this in turn says that the hyperbolic geodesics are funk geodesics , or  as hilbert would say  that the funk metric is projective .",
    "this result is a hyperbolic analogue of corollary 8.2 of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath94 is in the set @xmath139 and the three points @xmath140 do not lie on a geodesic , the concatenation of the geodesic segments @xmath141 and @xmath142 is also a funk geodesic , a situation occurring when the boundary set @xmath28 contains a hyperbolic geodesic segment ; a statement which is a hyperbolic analogue of corollary 8.4 of @xcite .",
    "we next consider the complementary situation where @xmath143 for any pair of distinct points @xmath144 .",
    "geometrically this characterizes strict convexity of the domain @xmath0 , namely the boundary @xmath28 contains no closed line segment . from the preceding argument",
    ", it follows that the only way the equality for the triangle inequality occurs is when the three points @xmath17 and @xmath18 are collinear .",
    "hence , for strictly convex domains , the funk geodesics consist of line segments only .",
    "equivalently , given a pair of distinct points in @xmath0 , there is a unique funk geodesic connecting them .",
    "this corresponds to corollary 8.8 of @xcite .",
    "we summarize this in the following    [ prop : geod - f ] let @xmath0 be an open convex subset of @xmath2 and let @xmath145 be its funk metric .",
    "then ,    1 .",
    "the hyperbolic geodesics of @xmath0 are also funk geodesics ; 2 .",
    "the funk geodesics of @xmath0 are hyperbolic geodesics if and only if @xmath0 is strictly convex , that is , if its boundary does not contain any nonempty open hyperbolic segment .",
    "there is another proof of proposition [ prop : geod - f ] that gives at the same time the triangle inequality for the funk metric .",
    "it imitates the classical proofs of the triangle inequality given in the case of the euclidean funk geometry that are given in @xcite p. 158 and",
    "@xcite p. 85 .",
    "we present it in the appendix of this article .",
    "let us also note the following    any hyperbolic geodesic segment starting at a point @xmath8 in @xmath0 and ending at a point on @xmath146 is ( the image of ) a geodesic ray for the funk metric on @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from the formula defining the funk metric ( definition [ d : funk - h ] ) and the fact that the hyperbolic geodesics in @xmath0 are funk geodesics .",
    "let us consider the particular example of a funk metric , where the open convex set @xmath0 is an ideal triangle of @xmath71 .",
    "we choose the case of the ideal triangle because such a triangle exists only in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we can model the triangle to be the region in the upper half plane bounded by the @xmath9-axis , which we call @xmath147 , the line @xmath148 , which we call @xmath149 and the semi - circle @xmath150 connecting the origin and @xmath151 and which is perpendicular to the real line .",
    "the lines @xmath152 are also the supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 . without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that two distinct points @xmath153 and @xmath154 in @xmath0 are located so that the hyperbolic geodesic ray from @xmath153 through @xmath154 hits the @xmath9-axis @xmath147 at @xmath155 , and hence the hyperbolic funk distance @xmath156 is realized by @xmath157 .",
    "then an elementary calculation gives an explicit value of the funk distance as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the absolute value of the slope of the ( euclidean ) line segment connecting @xmath160 and the ( hyperbolic ) foot of @xmath160 on the @xmath9-axis @xmath147 .",
    "we next consider the infinitesimal linear structure of the funk metric @xmath70 , by identifying it with a finsler norm on the tangent spaces .",
    "we first recall the euclidean setting . in this",
    "setting , the funk metric is induced by a finsler structure , the _ tautological weak finsler structure _ in the sense of  @xcite , given by the following minkowski functional : @xmath161 in this formula , the supremum is achieved when the supporting hyperplane @xmath108 supports @xmath0 at the point where the ray @xmath162 meets the boundary set @xmath163 . using similarity of euclidean triangles , this can be written as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the unit tangent vector at @xmath8 with direction opposite to the gradient vector of the functional @xmath166 .",
    "we note that the gradient vector field s integral curves are the geodesics which meet the supporting hyperplane perpendicularly .",
    "the infinitesimal linear structure of the funk metric is obtained by linearizing the following expressions for a fixed @xmath167 , @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a geodesic ray with @xmath170 and @xmath171 and where @xmath172 is the point where the geodesic ray and the hyperplane @xmath108 intersect .",
    "we then have @xmath173    in turn , in the hyperbolic space we identify the value of the minkowski functional for the funk metric @xmath70 as @xmath174 or equivalently as @xmath175 where @xmath165 is the unit tangent vector at @xmath8 whose direction is opposite to the one of the gradient vector of the functional @xmath176 at @xmath8 . in this formula , it is easy to see that the supremum is achieved when the point @xmath172 coincides with a boundary point @xmath177 , namely @xmath178 .",
    "the two representations come from the linearizations of @xmath179 respectively , where @xmath180 is a geodesic ray with @xmath170 and @xmath171 and where@xmath172 is the point where the geodesic ray and the hyperplane @xmath108 intersect .    in either representation ,",
    "it is easy to see that the functional is convex in @xmath181 , since the functional @xmath182 is convex ( linear in particular ) in @xmath36 for each fixed @xmath106 , and since by taking the @xmath183 over @xmath184 , the convexity is preserved .",
    "alternatively one can see the convexity of the _ indicatrix _ @xmath185 , that is , the set of vectors with norm equal to one : @xmath186 by noting that for @xmath187 and @xmath188 in @xmath189 , we have @xmath190 this says @xmath191 lies inside the indicatrix @xmath189 , hence the unit ball of the norm @xmath192 is a convex set in @xmath193 .",
    "we now show that the infimum , among all piecewise @xmath39-paths @xmath194 with given endpoints , of the length computed with the finsler norm @xmath192 coincides with the funk metric .",
    "namely :    the finsler distance @xmath195 induced by the minkowski functional @xmath192 ( [ fo:1 ] ) or ( [ fo:2 ] ) coincides with the hyperbolic funk metric @xmath70 on @xmath196 .    for a given pair of points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath0 , let @xmath197 be the hyperbolic geodesic ray @xmath198 from @xmath8 through @xmath9 , and let @xmath199 be the point where this geodesic ray hits the boundary @xmath163 ( with the notation we have been using in the euclidean case ) .",
    "then the @xmath70-length of the curve @xmath200 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 is @xmath201 thus , the finsler distance @xmath202 is bounded above by the funk- type distance @xmath103 .    on the other hand , consider the convex set in @xmath48 bounded by the supporting hypersurface @xmath203 alone .",
    "this set has its own funk metric , @xmath204 there is a simple comparison @xmath205 , as @xmath206 is the supremum of @xmath207 over all the supporting hypersurfaces of which @xmath203 is one .",
    "hence for the pair @xmath208 , the value @xmath209 provides a lower bound for @xmath103 .",
    "as we have the equality @xmath210 we conclude that @xmath211 .",
    "we end this section by the following result , which contrasts with the case of euclidean geometry :    [ prop : nonconvex ] given a point @xmath8 in @xmath0 , the funk distance function @xmath145 is not convex in @xmath9 .",
    "consider a point @xmath8 in @xmath0 and a constant speed geodesic segment @xmath212 \\rightarrow   { \\mathbb h}^n$ ] with @xmath213 where @xmath9 is any point in @xmath0 .",
    "for a fixed supporting hyperplane @xmath108 of @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath165 the vector field that is the vector opposite to the gradient vector field of the functional @xmath214 .",
    "then the first and second derivative of the funk distance function are given as : @xmath215 and @xmath216    note that the quantity @xmath217 is equal to @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the angle between the velocity vector @xmath220 and the unit vector @xmath221 , and that the speed @xmath222 is constant over time .",
    "now the negative sectional curvature of @xmath48 implies that the angle @xmath219 is increasing in @xmath223 , which in turns implies @xmath224 therefore the value of the second derivative can not be of a definite sign , proving the claim .",
    "it is known ( @xcite ) that in contrast , the euclidean funk metric @xmath103 _ is _ convex in @xmath9 .",
    "we shall use the language we are used to in euclidean and hyperbolic geometry , namely , we shall call a _ hyperplane _ a complete totally geodesic codimension - one subspace . likewise , a ( closed or open ) connected component in @xmath1 bounded by a hyperplane is called a _",
    "half - space_.    the definition of a convex set on the sphere is more delicate than the one in euclidean or in hyperbolic space , because given any distinct two points on the sphere , there are two distinct geodesics ( arcs of great circle ) joining them . even if we insist on geodesics of shortest length , for some pairs of points of the sphere ( namely , for points which are diametrically opposite ) , there are two distinct geodesics of shortest length . for this reason ,",
    "we give the following    a subset @xmath0 of the sphere is said to be _ convex _ if @xmath0 is contained in an open half - space and if every pair of points in @xmath0 can be connecetd by a geodesic which is contained in @xmath0 .      given a convex set @xmath0 in @xmath1 ,",
    "represent it as @xmath225 where @xmath57 is a half - space bounded by a hyperplane @xmath61 tangent to @xmath163 at a boundary point @xmath59 .",
    "we call these submanifolds @xmath61 _ supporting hyperplanes _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the set @xmath226 indexes the set of all supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 , and the set @xmath227 denotes the set of supporting hyperplanes at the boundary point @xmath59 .",
    "[ sph.cvx ]    we are considering the sphere of radius one , that is , the space of constant curvature @xmath228 . otherwise , if the curvature is different from one , a constant factor has to be inserted in the trigonometric formulae .",
    "then for a point @xmath8 in the convex set @xmath0 and a hyperplane ( great sphere ) @xmath61 supporting @xmath0 at a boundary point @xmath177 , note that @xmath229 is at most @xmath230 . we also note that unless the point @xmath8 is the center of the hemisphere bounded by @xmath61 , the nearest point projection of @xmath8 to @xmath61 is single valued .",
    "now we define the funk metric in spherical geometry .",
    "we use the angular metric on the sphere , and we shall assume that the diameter of the open convex set @xmath0 is @xmath231 for reasons that will become apparent immediately after the next definition .    [ d : funk - s ] for a pair of points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath232 , we define the funk ( asymmetric ) metric by @xmath233 where ( as in the euclidean and the hyperbolic cases ) the point @xmath7 is the first intersection point of the boundary @xmath163 with the geodesic ray @xmath234 from @xmath8 through @xmath9 , and @xmath29 is the unit tangent vector at @xmath8 of the arc - length parameterized geodesic connecting @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "<S> the goal of this paper is to introduce and study analogues of the euclidean funk and hilbert metrics on open convex subsets @xmath0 of hyperbolic or spherical spaces . at least at a formal level , </S>",
    "<S> there are striking similarities among the three cases : euclidean , spherical and hyperbolic . </S>",
    "<S> we start by defining non - euclidean analogues of the euclidean funk weak metric and we give three distinct representations of it in each of the non - euclidean cases , which parallel the known situation for the euclidean case . as a consequence , all of these metrics are shown to be finslerian , and the associated norms of the finsler metrics are described . the theory is developed by using a set of classical trigonometric identities on the sphere @xmath1 and the hyperbolic space @xmath2 and the definition of a cross ratio on the non - euclidean spaces of constant curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to the concept of projectivity invariance in these spaces . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the geodesics of the funk and hilbert metrics . in the case of euclidean ( respectively spherical , hyperbolic ) geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the euclidean ( respectively spherical , hyperbolic ) geodesics are funk and hilbert geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> natural projection maps that exist between the spaces @xmath3 , @xmath2 and the upper hemisphere demonstrate that the theories of hilbert geometry of convex sets in the three spaces of constant curvature are all equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the same can not be said about the funk geometries .    </S>",
