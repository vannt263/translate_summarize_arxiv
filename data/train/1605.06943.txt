    "supramolecular polymerisation , @xmath0amyloid fibril formation , actin and microtubule polymerisation all have two features in common : ( i ) some form of activation and ( ii ) reversible elongation.@xcite activation can happen in many different ways , the most important being conformational switching @xcite and a minimum number of monomers coming together before elongation can take place ( nucleation).@xcite generally , the activation constant for the above - mentioned systems is very small compared to the elongation constant , giving rise to very sharp polymerisation transition as a function of , e.g. , the temperature , concentration , acidity and so on .",
    "this makes the polymerisation transition reminiscent of a phase transition.@xcite hence , if we keep aside details of the actual activation mechanism and other system - specific details , we can hope to understand the universal and the most interesting behavior of many such systems by relying on notions from the statistical mechanics of the phase transitions.@xcite    even though our understanding of the thermodynamics of supramolecular polymers and the role of activation or nucleation,@xcite solvent,@xcite conformational @xcite and compositional disorder @xcite has made great advances , much less is known about the underlying reversible polymerisation processes.@xcite the most extensively studied kinetic reaction rate models were initially set up to describe the equilibration of the length distribution of worm - like surfactant micelles in response to a temperature jump , and stress relaxation under shear flow via the dynamical breakdown and re - growth of polymeric assemblies.@xcite four kinetic pathways have been identified in this context : ( i ) end evaporation and addition,@xcite ( ii ) scission and recombination,@xcite ( iii ) end - interchange,@xcite and ( iv ) bond - interchange.@xcite in principle , one should consider not a single but a hybrid of pathways,@xcite but this is rarely done.@xcite    the reaction rate or master equations are invariably highly non - linear integro - differential equations , some of which elude exact analytical solutions even in linearised form.@xcite only in some limiting cases asymptotic analytical results have been obtained for the temporal evolution of the length distribution within the end - evaporation - and - addition and scission - recombination kinetics applying the rate - equation approach outside of the linearised regime.@xcite not surprisingly , it is tempting to obtain closed - form equations for first few moments only , presumably requiring the assumption that the shape of the probability distribution function does not change with time",
    ". this in turn requires pathways to be tuned in such a way that it may not be possible to obtain correct thermodynamic equilibrium ( e.g. , by assuming irreversible scission).@xcite    in this paper we present as an alternative to the above - mentioned approaches , a phenomenological dynamical landau theory for activated reversible polymerisation processes that makes use of what is known about the kinetics of phase transitions .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it allows for straightforward coupling of the equilibrium polymerisation to other kinds of macroscopic phase transition , such as phase separation and the spontaneous alignment in liquid crystalline states @xcite as well as to flow fields.@xcite the coupling is straightfoward because all the phenomena ( polymerisation , phase ordering of various kind ) can be treated on an equal footing in terms of appropriate order parameters . here , we focus on studying the dynamics of polymerisation in the absence of any symmetry breaking and flow fields , leaving that for future work .",
    "our theory is able to describe kinetic phenomena like hysteresis , overshooting , undershooting and the existence of a lag time observed experimentally , yet has only a single kinetic parameter .",
    "we argue that this parameter controls in some sense the relevant weights of different molecular pathways implicit in the theory .",
    "we find that our theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations on the assembly kinetics of @xmath0amyloids , at least if we renormalize the theory with an appropriate time scale .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we construct a thermodynamically consistent landau free energy involving two relevant non - conserved order parameters , representing two moments of the full distribution function , and then use that to construct our dynamical equations.@xcite the two moments we focus attention on are the polymer fraction and degree of polymerisation .",
    "we ignore any spatial variation and presume the system is well mixed at all times .",
    "our two nonlinear differential equations describing the temporal evolution of the two order parameters in essence depend on only two dimensionless groups .",
    "one , the describes the strength of the thermodynamic driving force towards polymerisation and the other , , selects the relaxation pathway . in section iii , we solve the linearised version of these equations and investigate transient phenomena known as `` overshooting '' and `` undershooting '' .",
    "the former has been observed in nucleated self - assembling polymer solutions of tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) coat protein @xcite and of actin.@xcite we analyse the delayed response before assembly takes off , an observable studied extensively in different types of system , in section iv .",
    "there , we solve our nonlinear evolution equation using the method of `` matched asymptotic expansion '' ( mae ) and obtain , in analytical form , the lag time as a function of the relevant mass action variable and the initial conditions . in section v",
    ", we provide an interpretation for our pathway control variable .",
    "we also discuss the phenomenon of temporal hysteresis and match our analytical results with experimental data for @xmath0amyloid fibril assembly and obtain excellent agreement if we allow for an offset .",
    "we end this paper with a summary and conclusion in section vi .",
    "our problem of interest is activated polymerisation in dilute yet well - mixed solution .",
    "this implies that we consider two basic components : assembly active polymers and assembly inactive monomers .",
    "inactive monomers have to acquire a high - energy , activated state to be able to polymerize .",
    "activated monomers convert inactive into active ones upon binding .",
    "if the latter does not require any free energy input , this is known as `` autosteric '' or `` auto - catalytic '' binding.@xcite if it does require a free energy input , we have conventional activated polymerisation.@xcite both types of polymerisation turn out to obey the same statistics , i.e. , the mass action models that describe these statistics are equivalent.@xcite    we arbitrarily choose the autosteric model . in it , the free - energy difference between active and inactive states is @xmath1 , and the free - energy gain upon bonding is @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the overall concentration ( mass fraction ) of monomers in the solution .",
    "if we now invoke the law of mass action and assume that the free monomers , the dimers , the trimers , etc .",
    ", do not mutually interact , we obtain for the active polymers an exponential distribution with an average degree of polymerisation that we denote @xmath4 .",
    "a fraction @xmath5 of the material is in the polymerised , i.e. , active state .",
    "the overall mean aggregation number , including active and inactive species , we denote @xmath6 . under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", one can show that @xcite f = , where @xmath4 obeys an equation of state given by x=1-|n_a^-1+k_a |n_a ( |n_a-1 ) . here",
    ", @xmath7 is our mass - action variable and @xmath8 the activation constant , where , @xmath9 denotes the thermal energy with @xmath10 boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 the absolute temperature .",
    "note that the mean degree of polymerisation averaged over active and inactive species obeys @xmath12 .    from eqn .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we deduce that @xmath13 .",
    "if we demand that @xmath14 and @xmath15 , then @xmath16 .",
    "so , indeed , the polymerisation transition becomes infinitely sharp in the limit @xmath14 , with @xmath17 it is straightforward to show that in this limit the heat capacity exhibits a jump at the polymerisation point @xmath18 , as to be expected from mean - field arguments.@xcite the limit @xmath14 is sensible because experimental values are typically @xmath19.@xcite    now that we have convinced ourselves that the polymerisation transition resembles a phase transition,@xcite we may attempt to describe it by constructing a landau free energy that will become a starting point of a dynamical theory .",
    "we recall that there are two types of distribution : an exponential size distribution of active polymers and a distribution over active and inactive material .",
    "this implies that we should be able to describe the thermodynamics of activated polymerisation with only two order parameters , one representing the fraction of polymerised material @xmath5 and the other describing the mean aggregation number of active material @xmath4 . from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we conclude that whilst @xmath5 is critical in the limit @xmath14 , @xmath4 is not . in this limit @xmath5",
    "is non - zero only if @xmath20 yet @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , from eqn .",
    "( 2 ) we find that at @xmath18 , @xmath23 if @xmath24 .",
    "hence , only @xmath5 exhibits a sharp transition at the polymerisation point.@xcite    parenthetically we note that for @xmath25 , eq . ( 1 ) suggests that @xmath26 and it seems therefore that as @xmath5 becomes critical , so does @xmath4 .",
    "however , because we are interested in the limit @xmath14 , the product @xmath27 going to zero does not mean that @xmath4 also goes to zero or even to unity as we have just seen .",
    "hence , it makes sense not to use @xmath4 as order parameter but instead a quantity proportional to @xmath27 . in this case",
    "both order parameters are zero below the critical point @xmath18 , and non - zero and finite above it even in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to point out in this context that our statistical mechanical model is identical to the tobolsky - eisenberg model for ( spontaneous ) sulfur polymerization , which is an example of activated equilibrium polymerization.@xcite wheeler and pfeuty@xcite have shown that a magnetic spin lattice model , the so - called n - vector model , becomes equivalent to the tobolsky - eisenberg theory in the limit @xmath28 . in that model",
    ", the spin - spin coupling constant corresponds to our elongation constant @xmath29 , whereas the magnetic field strength maps onto the activation constant @xmath30 .",
    "wheeler and pfeuty show that in their prescription the number concentration of polymers depends linearly on the external field .",
    "hence , in the limit of zero magnetic field , the number concentration of polymers tends to zero .",
    "a vanishing number concentration of polymer chains has to accommodate a finite polymerized mass , giving rise to a diverging mean degree of polymerization above the critical point .",
    "this confirms that it is not sensible to use @xmath4 as an order parameter in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that a sensible landau free energy describing nucleated polymerisation must involve two coupled order parameters . in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", this free energy should retrieve eqn .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) or ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , which are equivalent in the appropriate limit @xmath14 . to stay within the philosophy of landau theory we opt for the latter ,",
    "because it allows us to invoke the relevant control variable , @xmath31 , and let it play a role similar to temperature .",
    "the mass action variable @xmath32 depends on the solution conditions , that is , the concentration @xmath3 , the temperature @xmath11 and , depending on the type of system , on the solvent , the acidity and the salinity that ( apart from temperature ) control the binding free energy @xmath33 .",
    "as we have seen , the polymer fraction @xmath34 shows a sharp continuous transition , which is a signature of a second order phase transition , requiring a landau free energy function consisting of even powers of the corresponding order parameter . to satisfy two essential properties of the theory , i.e. , a second - order - like transition and non - negativity of polymer fraction @xmath5",
    ", we select this order parameter to be @xmath35 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we denote our first order parameter as @xmath36 , giving us the first two terms in our free energy ( per particle ) as @xmath37 , in accordance with the requirements of the free energy for the second order phase transition , and showing a transition at @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath39 is transition point of the control variable @xmath31 , even though minimizing this free energy does not quite produce eqn .",
    "( 3 ) yet as it is off by a factor of two .",
    "this , we fix below .",
    "apart from the critical order parameter @xmath40 that is related to the fraction of active material @xmath5 , we have to introduce another order parameter , @xmath41 , that somehow describes the degree of polymerisation of the active material , @xmath4 , and that is a proper order parameter . as already suggested , an in this context natural order parameter would be @xmath42 , which is also critical but which in our model is enslaved by @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests a contribution to the free energy density a term proportional to @xmath43 , and a coupling term that establishes the enslavement of @xmath41 to @xmath40 .",
    "we have to keep in mind that in equilibrium we have to obey eqn .",
    "this we manage by adding to our free energy the terms @xmath44 .",
    "the introduction of the coupling term @xmath45 ensures that we automatically obey eqn .",
    "( 1 ) _ and _ ( 3 ) in equilibrium , that is , if we minimize the free energy with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in conclusion",
    ", we obtain the following free energy per solute molecule @xmath46 that obeys , = -(1 -x^-1 ) s_1 ^ 2 + s_1 ^ 4 + s_2 ^ 2 - s_1 ^ 2 s_2 , and that meets all requirements .",
    "note that as usual @xmath9 denotes the thermal energy .",
    "as another thermodynamic consistency check , we calculate the specific heat using this free energy .",
    "it turns out to be consistent with that obtained invoking the law of mass action ( or the equivalent microscopic thermodynamic theory).@xcite we refer to appendix a for details .",
    "now that we have defined our free energy landscape , we can build on that our dynamical theory . using the appropriate description for non - conserved order parameters ( model",
    "a),@xcite we set @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 phenomenological relaxation rates for our order parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in line with common practice , and in the absence of a clear microscopic interpretation , we presume these relaxation rates to be independent of the order parameters",
    ". as we shall see , this simplification will prove sufficient to produce all known dynamical behaviours of supramolecular assembly , including a lag phase , overshoots and hysteresis .",
    "the resulting dynamical equations now read @xmath50 where we introduced a dimensionless time , @xmath51 , and a the ratio of relaxation rates @xmath52 that will prove to be our kinetic pathway controller . in principle , this could point towards a microscopic interpretation of the kinetic parameters and a possible evaluation of whether , and if so , how , they should depend on the order parameters .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "superficially , this set of coupled dynamical equations looks very simple . however , their highly non - linear character heralds not only a complex dynamical behavior but also difficulty in dealing with them analytically .",
    "their non - linear character can be reduced somewhat by a simple transformation : @xmath53 and @xmath54 . here",
    ", @xmath5 is as before the fraction of polymerised material , and @xmath55 is a measure for the degree of polymerisation of the active material that from now on we call the renormalised active degree of polymerisation or renormalised mean polymer length . inserting this into eqn .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we obtain & = & 4 ( 1 - ) f ( ) + 4 f ( ) - 8 f()^2 , + & = & f ( ) - ( ) .",
    "note that if we solve the above set of dynamical equations with the initial condition @xmath56 , they will not evolve towards the correct equilibrium point , i.e. , the minimum of the free energy .",
    "this is to be expected , as our theory is a dynamical mean field theory , if the starting point is a maximum free energy state , the order parameters will not evolve in the absence of fluctuations . in the present study ,",
    "we choose not to include noise and hence focus on `` seeded polymerization '' . also notice that the highest order non - linear term in eqn .",
    "( 8) is now quadratic rather than cubic as is the case in eqn .",
    "( 6 ) , and the quadratic term in eqn . ( 7 ) becomes linear in eqn .",
    "this makes a linear analysis more accurate .",
    "as we shall show in the next section , even at the linearised level our governing equations give rise to the interesting transient phenomena of overshooting and undershooting .",

    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , has evaded us . a numerical evaluation of eqn .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) in fig .",
    "( 1 ) shows that if we perturb the fraction of polymerised material and/or their mean aggregation number away from their equilibrium values , these quantities do not necessarily relax in a simple exponential fashion , but can exhibit a transient response of non - monotonic growth or decay before approaching equilibrium .",
    "there are two types of non - monotonic relaxation that we call and .@xcite what this means precisely , will become clear below . note that overshooting of the polymerised fraction has been observed in actin assembly,@xcite and that of the active degree of polymerisation in tmv coat protein assembly.@xcite we have not been able to find examples of undershooting ; most experimental studies focus on assembly rather than disassembly .",
    "interestingly , overshooting and undershooting present themselves to us even in a linearised version of the governing equations , which we can solve exactly .",
    "the analytical solution allows us to demarcate different kinetic regimes dominated by overshooting , undershooting and simple exponential relaxation for both quantities @xmath5 and @xmath55 . to linearize eqns .",

    "both these equilibrium conditions are true if and only if @xmath74 , for any finite value of @xmath31 .",
    "but in the limit @xmath71 , the equilibrium solution , @xmath75 , becomes unstable .",
    "( 1 ) shows that both numerical and linear solutions point at the existence of overshooting , undershooting and exponential monotonic relaxation .",
    "we never find overshooting and undershooting in both observables .",
    "what kind of response and in what variable we find the different types of response depends entirely on the initial conditions , i.e. , on the values that our two order parameters have at time zero .",
    "the demarcation between different types of behavior we can evaluate using the linearised theory . for this purpose , we define the ( dimensionless ) time of transient response , @xmath76 , as the time at which the quantity showing a non - monotonic transient response is at its extremum . from eqn .",

    "( 12 ) through ( 16 ) .",
    "the transient times can not be zero for the solutions obtained from a linear analysis because of the absence of any sigmoidal response at that level of approximation .",
    "as overshooting and undershooting can occur in both @xmath5 and @xmath55 , but never in both , this gives rise to four sets of initial conditions for each type of the transient response .",
    "we tabulate these in table i , for positive and negative perturbation around the equilibrium values , and notice that the demarcation of the various regimes depend on both @xmath31 and @xmath79 , so on thermodynamics and kinetics .",

    ", we can deduce this by calculating the curvature of the quantity showing transient response at the point of the extremum , that is , by calculating the second derivative of @xmath5 and @xmath55 with respect to time .",
    "conditions that we derive from the second - derivative test turn out to be extremely complicated expressions , and hence we use a simpler method to find what kind of transient response our order parameters show .",
    "it hinges on evaluating the slope of @xmath5 and @xmath55 at zero time and connecting that to the expected response from table i. for instance , if conditions are such that @xmath5 shows transient behavior and if the slope at zero time is negative ( positive ) then we know that we are dealing with undershooting ( overshooting ) .",
    "( 2 ) shows how the initial conditions dictate whether we have overshooting , undershooting or monotonic relaxation .",
    "although this `` phase diagram '' is inferred from a linear analysis , it gives us information as to when overshooting or undershooting will occur for a specified set of parameters .",

    "indeed , table i is exhaustive in describing all regimes of initial conditions that are mutually exclusive among the three different kinds of response .     and @xmath93 as a function of their initial conditions .",

    "2 , if the initial conditions are such that the system starts in the region between the local equilibrium conditions then no transient response is observed .",
    "if we start with initial conditions away from the equilibrium point , the system first transiently evolves towards either condition 1 or 2 , depending on the initial conditions and once that has been accomplished , both the order parameters simultaneously decay to satisfy eqn .",
    "( 3 ) . in the process of @xmath5 following @xmath55 , or vice versa depending on the initial conditions and the value of pathway controller , our order parameters show overshoot , undershoot or monotonic response .",
    "this implies that the only transition that is sensitive to the value of @xmath79 , is that between undershoot and overshoot .",
    "obviously , it would be very useful to have a physical interpretation for the existence of the various regimes shown in table i and in fig .",
    "( 2 ) . for instance",
    ", the question arises what plausible mechanism causes overshooting to occur in the polymerised fraction .",
    "this occurs , as per table i , under conditions where the initial mean degree of polymerisation of active material is large and the polymerised fraction is much smaller compared to its equilibrium value . in that case , assembly starts with very few but very long filaments .",
    "these filaments can efficiently tend to equilibrium by breaking , and in the process create new nucleation centers .",
    "the number of segments a filaments has broken into depends on two factors : ( 1 ) length of the polymer and ( 2 ) probability of breaking of bonds ( which in principle is also a function of length of the polymer ) .",
    "if a large polymer has been broken into a number of nucleation centers greater than the equilibrium number of polymers , then each newly created nucleation center extends towards the equilibrium length .",
    "this in turn causes the amount of polymerised material to be more than the equilibrium value and hence leads to the disintegration of some of the polymers in the end to satisfy the law of mass action .",
    "this is what we indeed observe as an overshoot in the polymerised fraction , which first increases to a value greater than equilibrium value and then decays towards equilibrium .",
    "we conclude that the overshoot in @xmath5 is directly connected with polymers being able to fragment by random scission .",

    ", we use the conventional definition , that is , we find the time at which we have the maximum growth rate , determine the tangent at that point and identify its time intercept as the lag time.@xcite of course , to be able to do this we have to supply the dynamical equations with initial conditions . the equilibrium relation between the polymerised fraction and the mean polymer length is @xmath113 , but we arbitrarily choose @xmath114 for @xmath107 , and hence we start off with out - of - equilibrium initial conditions .",

( 2 ) .",
    "the origin of the lag time is the time required to create nucleation centers , which then grow into equilibrium polymers . indeed , increasing the initial polymerised fraction is equivalent to seeding the system,@xcite and hence these pre - nucleation seeds then start elongating straight away , reducing the overall time required for nucleation .",

    "what we have not shown , however , is that in disassembly a lag phase is always absent .",
    "hence , there is an inherent asymmetry between the polymerisation and depolymerisation kinetics .",
    "we call this asymmetry in the kinetics _ temporal hysteresis_. it is of interest to study in more detail in what way assembly is different from disassembly and what the parameters are that affect this .",
    "we confine ourselves to the hysteresis under conditions characterized by a lag phase in the assembly and use analytical solution for polymerised fraction , eqn . ( 18 ) , for that purpose .    to be able to compare the assembly and disassembly kinetics in a quantitative fashion , we perform a theoretical cyclic quench experiment , using our model . for this",
    ", we quench the system from one equilibrium state @xmath143 to another equilibrium state @xmath144 , and after equilibration has taken place we quench back from @xmath145 to @xmath146 . the former is an assembly process that potentially experiences a lag phase and the latter a disassembly process that does not have a lag phase . for a meaningful comparison between assembly and disassembly , we define the quantity @xmath147 , where @xmath59 is the long - time ( equilibrium ) value of the polymerised fraction , @xmath5 , after the quenching .",
    "if assembly and disassembly do not exhibit hysteresis , the function @xmath148 is identical for the two processes in our cyclic quench experiment .",
    "if there is hysteresis , this is no longer the case .",
    "we find that the magnitude of temporal hysteresis , to be specified in more detail below , depends on two factors : i ) the width of the quench interval , @xmath149 , and ii ) the distance of the quench interval from the critical point @xmath18 .",
    "as to be expected , in the limit @xmath150 , we do not find any hysteresis as the quench experiment is perturbative and hence the problem becomes a linear one . also , as @xmath143 moves away from the critical point at @xmath18 , the level of hysteresis decreases and , indeed , in the limit @xmath151 hysteresis is absent .",
    "the reason is that , as we have seen in the preceding sections , the lag phase for the assembly ceases to exist for the large initial polymerised fraction . in this case",
    "@xmath152 need not be very small for the hysteresis to vanish .    to support these two statements",
    ", we define a quantity that we call the hysteretic area , @xmath153 , defined as the area between the kinetic curves , @xmath148 , for the assembly and disassembly in a cyclic quench experiment up to the point of intersection of the two , see also fig .",
    "( 7 ) . to understand the reason for the existence of the hysteretic area",
    ", we revisit eqn .",
    "( 18 ) , and note that the polymerised fraction , @xmath5 , has two time scales : one associated with the apparent growth rate @xmath154 independent of initial conditions , and the half time @xmath132 that does depend on the initial polymerised fraction .",
    "the latter quantity becomes negative if the initial conditions are such that the system evolves to equilibrium via disassembly . as a consequence ,",
    "disassembly evolves with only one of these two relaxation times , whereas assembly has both of them .",
    "this difference in time scales between assembly and disassembly gives rise to non - overlapping kinetic curves , and hence to a non - zero hysteretic area and also an intersection point .",
    "for this reason , it makes sense to focus on area between the two curves upto the point of intersection that gives us the quantitative measure for the level of hysteresis .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "( 8) , showing the hysteretic area , @xmath153 , for various quenches between @xmath143 and @xmath145 .",

    "the figure also shows that the hysteretic area decreases as @xmath143 moves away from the critical point , @xmath18 .",
    "this confirms that we can indeed conclude that the hysteretic response of polymerisation _ vs _ depolymerisation disappears as we move away from critical point @xmath18 and hence is a characteristic of nucleated or activated self assembly .",

    "see also the main text.,width=316 ]    we used our results of section ( iv ) for the lag phase to study the potential kinetic asymmetry between the assembly and disassembly .",
    "our analysis of the lag phase along with that of the transient response , discussed in section ( iii ) , turns out to allow us to provide a physical or molecular interpretation of the phenomenological parameters in our theory .",

    "@xmath31 describes the final thermodynamic state of the solution , as we have shown in section ( ii ) , whereas @xmath79 controls the temporal evolution of the polymerised fraction , @xmath5 , and the mean polymer length of active material , @xmath4 , towards that final thermodynamic state that potentially takes place via a plethora of pathways.@xcite    the relative weight of each of the pathways governs in the end the precise kinetics of our linearly polymerizing system , and this suggests that there must be a connection between the parameter @xmath79 and the relative weight of these pathways .",
    "this is why we referred to it as the pathway controller . to justify that @xmath79 must indeed be a pathway controller , we revisit fig .",
    "( 5 ) showing how the parameter @xmath79 influences in what way the polymerised fraction evolves as a function of time .",
    "initial conditions are such that at zero time the fraction of polymerised material is vanishingly small and ( eventually ) equilibrates to the value of one half . in the limit @xmath158 , however , we obtain a pseudo plateau that arguably hints at how the pathways and the value of @xmath79 are related .",
    "this pseudo plateau emerges because of a diverging time scale that emerges post lag - phase , in the late - stages of the assembly process .",
    "we also find a similar pseudo plateau for the mean polymer length , @xmath4 .",
    "the reason that we associate this psuedo plateau with a specific reaction pathway , is that semenov and nyrkova find within the rate equation approach a similar late - stage diverging time scale for the so - called scission - recombination pathway.@xcite they conclude that in the limit @xmath14 , the mean polymer length of the active material displays a signature of critical slowing down in particular for @xmath159 .",
    "however , the critical region vanishes in that same limit @xmath14 and hence should not be observable in the limit where our theory is valid .",
    "what remains in the semenov - nyrkova theory is the time scale that scales as @xmath160 and that time scale diverges irrespective of the value of the mass action variable , @xmath31 , which is also true for our model.@xcite so , this suggests that our @xmath158 limit should represent reversible scission - recombination pathway .",
    "other aspects of the kinetics point in the same direction , in particular the transients .",
    "indeed , we observe in fig .",
    "3 that the magnitude of the overshoot increases with decreasing value of the pathway controller , @xmath79 . in section ( iii ) , we rationalized the existence of an overshoot in terms of almost instantaneous scission of very few , very long polymers combined with a somewhat slower unspecified growth mechanism .",
    "as @xmath79 increases , overshooting becomes less prominent and disappears completely for @xmath105 : this ties in with a decreasing ability of the polymers to break and create nucleation centers that then can grow .",
    "as @xmath118 , scission must be absent within our interpretation .",
    "the polymers will in that case be nucleated from inactive monomers and hence we see the lag phase emerging instead of an overshoot .    in conclusion , we have a kinetic parameter in our phenomenological theory that plausibly acts as a pathway controller . a natural question that now arises",
    "is : if @xmath79 is indeed the pathway controller , then why is the lag time independent of it ? to answer this question , we need to understand that the lag time arises as a consequence of the existence of a nucleation barrier and effectively takes place at the monomer level , i.e. , does not involve any polymers .",
    "the reason is that an assembly inactive monomer needs to transition to an assembly active state before it can partake in a polymerisation reaction .",
    "naively , the lag phase is controlled on the one hand by the free energy difference between the active and inactive monomer states , and on the other by the thermodynamic driving force towards the polymerised state .",
    "this explains why , as @xmath131 , the lag time diverges as the thermodynamic driving force becomes zero .",
    "it does not explain , however , why in our model , even for infinite thermodynamic driving force , so for @xmath71 , the lag time does not vanish .",

    "as we have discussed in previous section , our lag time remains non - zero even for infinite concentration , whereas in the experiments the lag time does tend to zero with increasing concentration .",

    "<S> although pathway - specific kinetic theories are fundamentally important to describe and understand reversible polymerisation kinetics , they come in principle at a cost of having a large number of system - specific parameters . here , we construct a dynamical landau theory to describe the kinetics of activated linear supramolecular self - assembly , which drastically reduces the number of parameters and still describes most of the interesting and generic behavior of the system in hand . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological approach hinges on the fact that if nucleated , the polymerisation transition resembles a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to describe hysteresis , overshooting , undershooting and the existence of a lag time before polymerisation takes off , and pinpoint the conditions required for observing these types of phenomenon in the assembly and disassembly kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the phenomenological kinetic parameter in our theory is a pathway controller , i.e. , it controls the relative weights of the molecular pathways through which self - assembly takes place . </S>"
