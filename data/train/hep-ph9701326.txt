    "indent in the previous papers [ 1 - 4 ] the properties of color tubes and their fission are considered on the basis of a semi - phenomenological effective lagrangian of ( 1 + 1 ) - dimensional theory of two scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 describing the simultaneous change of color tube chromoelectric field and radius [ 1 ] . from the point of view of our theory",
    "a color tube is a soliton kink ( @xmath3)+antikink ( @xmath4)- like solutions of field equations .",
    "the color charges are arranged in walls @xmath3 and @xmath4 that are moving apart in opposite directions with large momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the color tube is a metastable state and it is `` hadronized '' by fission to primary hadrons , which decay into observable particles .",
    "we are interested in inclusive spectra ( is ) of primary hadrons created by fission of a tube with small surface oscillations .",
    "our approach to the tube fragmentation into hadrons is close to artru- menessier model [ 5](as well as other models [ 6 - 9 ] based on artru - menessier approach ) . from the point of view of our effective 1 + 1 dimensional theory",
    "a color tube is a kink and an antikink ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) that are moving apart in opposite directions and between which the color tube is formed .",
    "the breaking of the tube is a transition from the state of a pair ( @xmath7 ) to a state(@xmath8)that is degenerate with it and such that , between extra pair ( @xmath9 ) that have been formed inside the tube , we have a true vacuum state ( the color field is equal to zero ) .    at each stage of hadronization process",
    "the tube splits into pieces with arbitrary masses as far as the distance between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 walls of piece becomes of the order of thickness of the wall .",
    "this causes growth of kink mass and rapid decrease of the probability of tube fission and therefore the hadronization process stops .",
    "the produced pieces form the primary hadrons that can be attributed to stable hadrons ( pions and kaons ) as well as hadron resonances .",
    "we limit ourselves by particles with light cone momentum @xmath10 small in comparison with the initial light cone momentum of the tube @xmath11 .",
    "generally the procedure of is calculation is the following .",
    "we must integrate over the probability of tube fission at @xmath12 space - time points that formed the pieces with given light cone momenta over all allowed positions of fission space - time points [ 5,9,10 ] .",
    "the basic quantity for calculation is the probability of tube fission as a function of fission point @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dimensionless space and time coordinates of fission point .",
    "we shell use the probability @xmath16 that includes the tube surface small oscillation corrections .    in our tube model",
    "there are two kinds of surface oscillations with large and small quanta masses that play different roles in the tube formation and subsequent evolution [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the large -mass oscillations play essential role in the formation of color tube [ 2 ] : they lead to the breaking of the tube ( with the probability @xmath17 ) that just begins grow .",
    "only small amplitude of @xmath18 small mass oscillations remain in created pieces [ 2 ] .",
    "fission probability of such a tube is small and accordingly its evolution time is large .",
    "the tube grows lengthwise and its length become much larger then radius .",
    "small mass oscillations produce corrections to exponential factor of fission probability of long tube that are proportional to oscillation amplitude squared @xmath19.\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the function which explicit form depends on initial shape of color tube . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the dimensionless kink mass and tube tension respectively .    for is calculation",
    "we need to more accurately calculate the fission probability including the pre - exponential factor corrections .",
    "therefore before going to calculate is we discuss ( in section 2 ) the general approach to pre - exponential factor calculation for tunneling transition process from false vacuum + smal classical field to true vacuum and calculate a fission probability including the tube surface oscillations corrections with pre - exponential factor accuracy ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we obtain a general formula for tube breaking in @xmath0 different space - time points that is leading to production of @xmath24 pieces with lengths @xmath25 respectively .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in conclusions .",
    "here we shell explore the pre - exponential factor in the probability @xmath16 ( per unit time and per unit length ) of transition false vacuum + classical field @xmath26 true vacuum in minkowski space .",
    "following the general approach of ref.[12 ] we consider the lagrangian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the field variable , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; the metric is @xmath32 .",
    "we denote the initial state false vacuum and classical field variables respectively by @xmath33 and @xmath34 and final state true vacuum field by @xmath35 .",
    "the tunneling transition in which we are interested takes place from the state @xmath36 into such state @xmath37 that for @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40 and for @xmath41 the field @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that @xmath34 is the field of small classical oscillations and express it in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the amplitudes and modes of normal oscillations , respectively .    as it was shown in ref.[12 ] the `` most probable escape path '' ( mpep ) in the function space connecting from @xmath46 to @xmath37 can be described by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the function of time . to obtain the solution of tunneling problem the pair @xmath49",
    "must be considered as the dynamical variables and the field functional integral should be treated as a path integral over functions @xmath50 .",
    "let us consider first the case when all @xmath51 . as it was shown in ref.[2 ] the proper choice for collective variable @xmath52 is the kink - antikink ( @xmath53 ) configuration solution of field equations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 located at @xmath54 and @xmath55 , moving with velocities @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively [ 2 ] @xmath58 it must be noted that @xmath59 inside the interval @xmath60 and @xmath61 far away from this region .",
    "it is obvious that the mpep parameter @xmath50 coincide with @xmath55 at @xmath62 and with @xmath54 at @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the center of the @xmath53 pair .",
    "thus the transition amplitude for tunneling process can be written in the form @xmath65 \\label{path}\\ ] ] where @xmath66-l[a_i])\\ ] ] is the effective lagrangian of dynamical variable @xmath48 that describes the tunneling process .",
    "it is easy to verify that in the thin wall approximation ( i.e. when the sizes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are much less then @xmath67 ) for @xmath68 we obtain @xmath69+\\rho(\\lambda_{\\bar{k}}- \\lambda_k)\\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the mass of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath70 the first term in ( 7 ) is the lagrangian of the free motion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with velocities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , and the second term is the contribution to the volume energy of the region between @xmath3 and @xmath4 from @xmath71 , @xmath23 is the ( constant ) energy density per unit length .",
    "now we proceed to calculate the @xmath48 path - integral in the quadratic approximation . according to the semiclassical ideology [ 12 - 21 ] the quadratic approximation for tunneling amplitude path - integral ( [ path ] )",
    "can be obtained by expanding of the effective action around the mpep that is classical solution of equation of motion for @xmath72 for imaginary time @xmath73 [ 18 ] .",
    "thus we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 obeys the equations @xmath76 with the initial conditions [ 2 ] @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "now after simple calculations in quadratic approximation for amplitude @xmath79 we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the imaginary part of `` classical '' action for mpep @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 with boundary conditions for @xmath85 @xmath86 the time of the motion @xmath3 and @xmath4 under barrier @xmath87 and @xmath88 are given by the relations [ 2 ] @xmath89 and we obtain for @xmath90 the following simple expression @xmath91 where @xmath92    the path integral @xmath90 can be easily calculated by generalized @xmath93-function method [ 10,18 ] and after extracting zero mode contribution [ 12,13,19 ] we obtain @xmath94 where v is the volume of space - time .",
    "thus for transition probability @xmath16 we obtain the following expression @xmath95    the above expression is closely related to the result previously obtained by voloshin [ 21 ] , who calculated transition probability by using the `` bubble '' effective lagrangian in euclidean space . as we have seen the same expression",
    "can be derived also directly in minkowski space although the minkowski @xmath68 differs from euclidean @xmath96 .",
    "now we will show that the @xmath68 have the form ( 22 ) for wide class of lagrangians allowing a true and false vacuum states and @xmath3 and @xmath4-like instanton solutions of field equations that connect the true vacuum to the false vacuum .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear lagrangian of fields @xmath97 ( @xmath98=1,2, ... @xmath99)that has the form @xmath100 where the matrix @xmath101 and potential @xmath102 are the functions of fields @xmath97 .",
    "we assume existence of the extrema of @xmath102 on sets of fields @xmath103 and @xmath104 that correspond to true and false vacua respectively and @xmath3 - and @xmath4 -type solutions of field equations .    without any loss of generality we can assume that @xmath101 is a diagonal matrix . then functional integral measure for lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) has the form @xmath105 = \\prod_{n } { \\cal{d } } a_n \\delta_f^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the determinant of matrix @xmath101 .",
    "let us introduce new field variables @xmath107 as follows @xmath108 in such a way that the jacobian of this variable transformation is proportional to @xmath109 . in these new field variables",
    "the functional integration measure has a very simple form @xmath110=\\prod{d \\varphi_n}\\ ] ] and for the lagrangian we obtain the following expression @xmath111 where @xmath112    from our assumption ( [ nvar ] ) it follows that the mpep in the @xmath113-function space is the @xmath114-type @xmath115 solution of the field equations with the same @xmath48 for all @xmath0 .",
    "the `` lorentz invariance '' tells us that the @xmath116 are dependent only on variable @xmath117 . now substituting in  ( [ lag2 ] ) the new mpep @xmath118 and passing to path integral over @xmath50 we obtain for @xmath68 in the thin wall approximation the same expression ( [ lag ] ) with new definitions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath119 [ \\partial{\\varphi_l}^{k\\bar{k}}/\\partial x],\\\\ \\rho=(\\lambda_{\\bar{k}}- \\lambda_k)^{-1}\\int dx [ u(\\varphi^{k\\bar{k}})-u(\\varphi^{f})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is set of @xmath113 -fields that correspond to set of @xmath121-fields .",
    "it is obvious that repeating the above path integral calculation procedure in quadratic approximation we obtain for transition probability the same expression ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "up to here we have considered only transition from false vacuum to true vacuum .",
    "now we return to the principal subject of our calculations : the probability of transition false vacuum+classical field @xmath26 true vacuum .",
    "the field configuration @xmath122 which is degenerate with @xmath123 can be approximated by @xmath124 where @xmath122 is given by formula ( [ akk ] ) .    in with the choice of @xmath125 in this form we must mention two facts .",
    "first , this approximation for @xmath122 implies that we have fixed the variations of the form of @xmath3 and @xmath4 beforehand , both in view of the effect of small classical field and process of motion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the following in the thin wall kink approximation we neglect in general the change of the form of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( the corresponding corrections are small ) .",
    "second , the motion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 now is asymmetric relative to the point @xmath64 , since , generally speaking , @xmath126 depends in a nontrivial way both on coordinates and time . now proceeding as in ref .",
    "[ 2 ] in the thin wall limit for the effective lagrangian we obtain @xmath127 where @xmath68 is the effective lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) of with @xmath128 , and second term in right hand side is the contribution to the volume energy of the region between @xmath3 and @xmath4 from small classical oscillations of the field , and @xmath129\\ ] ] is the lagrangian of @xmath0-th normal mode of oscillations .    to calculate the effective action in the quadratic approximation we expand @xmath130 around new mpep ,",
    "that is , classical solution of equation of motion for @xmath130 for imaginary time @xmath15 . proceeding as in ref.[2 ] after simple but slightly cumbersome calculations",
    "we obtain up to terms @xmath131 @xmath132 where @xmath133 re f(x_0,t_0),\\\\ & & x_0=x_0+(m/\\rho ) \\sin{\\theta } \\cos{\\theta}/|\\cos{\\theta}|,\\\\ & & t_0=t_0 + i(m/\\rho)cos{\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath134 is the `` classical '' action for mpep [ 2 ] : @xmath135 and the function @xmath136 is defined by the integrals @xmath137 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int_{0}^{1 } dz\\int_{-(1-z^2)^{1/2}}^{(1-z^2)^{1/2 } } dz ' f_n(y(z'),t(z ) ) - \\int_{-1}^{1 } dz f_n(y(z),t_0)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138    thus the probability of tunneling transition has the form @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 denotes a functional determinant with vanishing eigenvalues removed .",
    "using generalized @xmath93-function method [ 18,20 ] we obtain for @xmath142 the expression @xmath143 where @xmath144 \\approx ( a^2/\\rho ) \\sum",

    "the only influence is an appearance of the new factor which depends on the classical field and makes the resulting probability to be a function of point of the transition origin .",
    "we do not enter here into a discussion of physical effects arising from small classical field ( see discussion in ref.[2 ] ) and only note that the field appearance can stimulate a `` catastrophical '' ( with @xmath147 ) transitions .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to obtain the probability @xmath16 of color tube fission including the small surface oscillation effects with pre - exponential factor accuracy . in other words ,",
    "we want to calculate the fission probability @xmath16 per unit length and per unit time of a color tube which has the radius @xmath148 and color electric field @xmath149 and length @xmath150 at the moment of its formation , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the stationary color tube radius and electric field respectively .    in order to calculate @xmath16 we use the previously constructed quasi - phenomenological model [ 1 ] , based on ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory of two scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath153 describing the simultaneous change of the radius of a tube and a chromoelectric field .    to study the tube fission it is convenient to choose field variables @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( where @xmath156 is the color interaction constant ) .then the lagrangian of the tube has the form [ 1 ] @xmath157\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 and the metric is @xmath32 .    it should be emphasized that we are dealing with two scalar fields and , accordingly ,",
    "the system of vacuum states of a hamiltonian @xmath159 consists of pairs of fields @xmath160 that correspond to one eigenvalue @xmath161.here we restrict ourselves to the first false vacuum state @xmath162 that corresponds to a quark tube .    as stated above in our model",
    "a color tube is kink and antikink ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) that are moving apart in opposite directions and between which the fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 are nonzero and equal to values@xmath163 and @xmath164 where @xmath151 and @xmath165 are the fields that correspond to unstable vacuum and @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the small classical fields .",
    "the breaking of the tube is a transition from the state of pair @xmath168 to a state @xmath169 which is degenerate with it and such that , between extra pair @xmath170 that are formed inside the tube we have a true vacuum with @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 ( ref.[2 ] )    let us consider first the case of a long tube and pair @xmath174 which is formed far from the ends of the tube .",
    "then the effect of the ends can be neglected , the tube can be regarded as infinite , and one can confine oneself to the thin wall approximation for @xmath175 .    as was shown in ref.[2 ]",
    "the mpep connecting initial and final states is the @xmath176 configuration of fields @xmath177 parameterized by one function @xmath48 . following the procedure of ref .",
    "[ 2 ] after some calculations we obtain ( in the thin wall approximation ) the effective lagrangian of @xmath50 in the form [ 2 ] @xmath178 + \\rho[\\lambda_{\\bar{k}}-\\lambda_k]\\\\-\\sum_{1}^{2}{a_n}^2 \\int_{\\eta_0-\\lambda_{\\bar{k}}}^{\\eta_0+\\lambda_k } d\\eta   f^{(n)}(\\eta,\\tau).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath179 is the energy density in the tube , @xmath180\\ ] ] is the renormalized ( dimensionless ) mass of the soliton , and @xmath181\\ ] ] is the lagrangian of small surface oscillations of the tube [ 2 ] , @xmath182 and @xmath183 is the amplitude of @xmath0-th oscillation mode .",
    "note that the presence of two fields @xmath184 and @xmath2 in @xmath68 manifests itself in the renormalization of the mass of the soliton and in the two contributions @xmath185 corresponding to the two kinds of small oscillations [ 2 ] .",
    "now the path integral that define the transition amplitude can be calculated in quadratic approximation just in the same way as it was made in previous section and one obtains for the tube fission probability @xmath186 where term @xmath187 accounts for the small oscillations of a tube surface that are created at the moment of tube formation .",
    "the functions @xmath188 contain the contributions of two different origin @xmath189 the part @xmath190 comes from the classical action for mpep and has the form @xmath191.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second contribution @xmath192 comes from the determinant of operator that describe the quadratic corrections to mpep action in path integral . for @xmath192",
    "one obtains ( see sec.2 ) @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 \\\\ & & f^{(n)}(\\tau_0 + ( m/\\epsilon^2)\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta/|\\cos\\theta| , i(m/\\epsilon^2)\\cos\\theta+\\tau_0).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as noted above the large - mass oscillations @xmath196 cause fission of tube in a very short time .",
    "thus the construction of tube itself terminates after all high frequency oscillations have been `` used '' on this fission and a tube has been formed in which only low - frequency interrelated oscillations of a radius and of a electric field @xmath197 and @xmath198 are kept .",
    "this means that on the tube which is formed , only those amplitudes of the oscillations of small mass @xmath199 survive for which the probability of fission stimulated by these oscillations can no longer become @xmath200 .",
    "it can be easily shown [ 2 ] that for sufficiently large @xmath201 and far from the edges of the tube with @xmath202 and @xmath203 at the moment of tube formation @xmath204 , the field @xmath205 is the function of @xmath206 only .",
    "accordingly , @xmath207 is the function of s and one have for probability of a tube fission @xmath208    so far we have considered one mpep soliton or , equivalently , tube fission via quark - antiquark pair of one type creation inside the tube . in real world",
    "the tube fission take place via @xmath209 pairs of many flavors or various diquark ect.pairs creation . in our tube model to each type of particle - antiparticle pair corresponds its own mpep or , other words , its own @xmath168-soliton with mass @xmath210 .",
    "this means that in the functional integral contribute many different mpep s and the total probability @xmath16 is the sum of partial probabilities @xmath211 of each type mpep s .",
    "thus one obtains @xmath212    it is evident that the sum ( [ prob4 ] ) is dominated by the term of smallest kink mass .",
    "however to calculate the inclusive spectra of primary hadrons of different types we need also other partial probabilities .",
    "when the distance of the kink wall from the end of the tube becomes of the order of the thickness of the wall , the influence of the end of the tube becomes important and , strictly speaking , the thin wall approximation for the@xmath175 that has been formed near the end of the tube is no longer applicable . it was shown in ref.[3 ] that the mass of @xmath213 increases with the decrease of the distance between the world point of the center of fission @xmath214 and the end of the tube , the probability of the fission should decrease near of the tube end .",
    "thus , even if the previous fission occurred at a distance @xmath215 from the tube end , first the fragment that has been formed `` expands '' in such a way that its length become greater than @xmath216 and only then does the real chance for the tube to break again .",
    "in our model the tube is formed by the color electric field of the moving ( in opposite directions in @xmath217 frame ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the motion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is decelerated by the tube tension and they will oscillate back and forth just as the yo - yo relativistic string . after some time the tube will break into two parts by production of a pair of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the space - time point @xmath218 . at later time",
    "another pair @xmath53 will be produced at @xmath219 and so on.the successive breaking of the tube form pieces of small length that are primary hadrons .",
    "for further discussion it is useful to introduce light - cone variables @xmath220 and @xmath221 and consider the process of tube breaking in @xmath222 coordinates in cm frame .",
    "we begin with the case of one type of kink .",
    "let us consider first the probability of tube fission into two pieces i.e. let the @xmath223 be the probability of tube breaking in only one world point .",
    "any breaking in the point @xmath218 means that now we have two independently developing tubes .",
    "the corresponding probability is the product of two factors : one is the probability @xmath224 $ ] that there is not any breaking before the world point @xmath225 or , in other words , inside the area @xmath226 , limited by the continuation of trajectories of created @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath226 is the area @xmath227 on fig.1 or is the strip @xmath228 where @xmath229 the second factor @xmath230 is the probability of tube breaking in the point @xmath231 .",
    "thus we have @xmath232    now we pass to the fission at the points @xmath233 and @xmath234 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "there are two different cases .",
    "the first one is that there are supplementary breaking between points @xmath231 and @xmath235 ( or in the area @xmath236 ) .",
    "then the probability @xmath237 is the product of : + ( i ) the probability @xmath223 that the first breaking point is @xmath231 ; + ( ii ) the probability @xmath238 , ( where @xmath239 is the area @xmath240 ) , that the point @xmath235 is just the new breaking point [ 5,10 ] .    thus we have @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the area @xmath243 or sum of strips @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "if the piece produced due the breaking @xmath231 and @xmath235 is not broken and develops like the `` yo - yo '' string then , we have an additional factor @xmath246 $ ] where @xmath247 is the area @xmath248 , that is , the probability that there is no any breaking in the @xmath249 .",
    "finally we have the same expression ( 70 ) with the only replacement @xmath250 $ ] .",
    "now it is easy to see that the probability of n successive breaking can be written in the form @xmath251e^ { - w(s_n)},\\ ] ] where the integration area is limited by the continuation of trajectories of created @xmath3 and @xmath4-s . for small kink mass",
    "the integration area @xmath252 is the sum of successive strips ( see fig.3 ) @xmath253 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for each stable piece produced by @xmath254 -th and @xmath255 -th adjacent breaking the supplementary strip @xmath256 $ ] must be added .    for many types of kinks repeating the above arguments we obtain for the probability of @xmath0 successive breaking when at point @xmath231 is created @xmath257 - pair of type @xmath258 , at point @xmath235 - of type @xmath259 etc . the following expression @xmath260e^{-w_t},\\ ] ] where @xmath261is the partial probability of tube breaking at the point @xmath262 due the creation @xmath257 pair of type @xmath263 given by the expression  ( [ prob6 ] ) and @xmath264",
    "is calculated using the formula  ( [ prob7 ] ) with evident replacement @xmath265 [ total probability ] @xmath266 with @xmath267 given by eq .",
    "( [ prob4 ] ) .",
    "the above expressions enable us to calculate the exclusive and inclusive spectra of primary hadrons , i.e. , the spectra of pieces of given length .",
    "the procedure of calculation is the following .",
    "we must integrate the probability of fission that form the pieces with momenta @xmath268 over all allowed positions of fission space - time points .",
    "it is convenient to use the the light - cone coordinates @xmath269 and @xmath270 and light - cone momenta @xmath271 and center - of - mass system of parent tube .",
    "since the light - cone momentum of piece produced by pair @xmath272 is given by @xmath273 the requirement that produced piece has light - cone momentum equal to @xmath274 means that the difference @xmath275 must be equal to @xmath276 .",
    "we can take this into account by introducing into integrand the @xmath277 and @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the piece transversal mass , for each piece .",
    "then we choose such an ordering of the fission points that corresponds to the momentum space region we are interested in .",
    "( it must be noted that each ordering of fission points corresponds to its specific region of momentum space . )",
    "the fission point ordering can be easily taken into account by introducing into the integrand @xmath280 - functions for @xmath269 and @xmath270 coordinates .",
    "now the integration area is the @xmath281-cube ( @xmath282 ) where @xmath0 is the number of breaking points .    for exclusive spectra",
    "the integrand is the probability of @xmath283 adjacent fission only .",
    "this means that all pieces ( except two that contain the edges of parent tube ) have the common point of @xmath168 pair creation .",
    "rather more complicated situation is for an inclusive spectra . in this case",
