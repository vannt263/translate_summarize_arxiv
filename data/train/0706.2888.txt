    "in the relatively new field of quantum information science , there have been limited numbers of true breakthroughs .",
    "the quantum computer remains a machine on paper only , for a working realization has proved elusive .",
    "for one of the most powerful tools that the quantum computer would provide , namely the reduction of the factorization problem to polynomial time by shor s algorithm , the most successful implementation to date has been to factor the number 15 into 3 times 5 [ 1 ] .",
    "the quantum computer might remain unrealized for years to come .",
    "indeed , kak has suggested that the current quantum circuit model for quantum computers is fundamentally flawed and new models must be developed to tackle the problem [ 2 ] .    while there have been limited strides in some areas of quantum information science , one area in particular",
    "has produced realizable solutions in the field of cryptography .",
    "quantum key distribution protocols have been successfully implemented and have produced commercially available products .    in this paper , we will discuss a new protocol proposed by kak called the `` three stage protocol . ''",
    "to kak s protocol , we will introduce a modification which allows for greater security against man in the middle attacks .",
    "in addition , we introduce a new single stage protocol which similarly allows for security against such attacks .",
    "the usefulness of quantum key distribution lies in the properties of the qubit , the quantum unit of information . since a qubit is an object representing a quantum superposition state , the qubit",
    "can not be copied .",
    "this is commonly called the no - cloning theorem [ 3 ] .",
    "this property ensures that during qubit data transmission , it is impossible for an evesedropper ( eve ) to simply make copies of the qubits being sent , and thus manipulate these copied qubits to obtain the message .",
    "this useful property allows quantum data transmission to be used effectively in key distribution protocols as shown in [ 3 ] .",
    "when a private key can be transmitted securly along a quantum channel , then secure classical communication between the two parties ( alice and bob ) can be achieved using the private key ( figure 1 ) .",
    "one private key cryptosystem in use today is the vernam cipher , also called the one time pad . according to nielsen and chuang , the security of the private key used in the vernam cipher is sometimes ensured by transmitting it via such low - tech solutions as clandestine meetings or trusted couriers .",
    "the need for better transmission protocols is obvious .",
    "in [ 4 ] , s. kak proposed a new quantum key distribution protocol based on secret unitary transformations ( figure 2 ) .",
    "his protocol , like bb84 , has three stages , but unlike bb84 , it remains quantum across all three stages . in the first stage , alice manipulates the message @xmath0 , which is simply one of two orthogonal stages ( e.g. @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) by means of a unitary transformation @xmath3 , known only to her .",
    "bob receives the new state , and in the second stage , applies his own secret transformation @xmath4 , which is both a unitary transformation , and one that commutes with @xmath3 , and sends the result back to alice . in the third stage , alice applies the hermitian conjugate of her transformation , @xmath5 , and sends the result back to bob .",
    "since @xmath6 , bob simply applies @xmath7 and obtains the previously unknown state , @xmath0 .",
    "the suceptability of both bb84 and kak s three - stage protocol to man in the middle attacks has been documented [ e.g. 5,6 ] , and various methods to counter these attacks have been proposed [ e.g. 7,8 ] .",
    "in such an attack , the eavesdropper , eve , can attempt to thwart the communication between alice and bob in one of the following ways ( figure 3 ) .",
    "* eve receives the message from alice by impersonating bob .",
    "eve then decodes alice s message , and , now impersonating alice , duplicates this message to bob . in this scenerio , both eve and bob obtain the secret message . *",
    "eve impersonates bob and decodes alice s message as in scenerio 1 , but instead of relaying the actual message to bob , eve relays a different message of her own choosing . in this scenerio",
    ", only eve obtains the secret message . *",
    "eve impersonates bob , but is not able to decode alice s message .",
    "instead , she impersonates alice and sends her own message to bob . in this scenerio ,",
    "communication between alice and bob is blocked , but no secret message is comprimised .",
    "in kak s paper [ 4 ] , he suggests using secret real valued orthogonal transformations to encrypt the qubits . under orthogonal transformations of the same form ( see below ) , the selection of the angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 by alice and bob respectively does not affect the outcome of the protocol .",
    "furthermore , both alice and bob do not need to know what each other s angle selection is .",
    "the reason that a man in the middle attack can be carried out is that when @xmath3 is assumed to be real valued , it is very easy for eve to find another unitary transformation , @xmath10 , which commutes with @xmath3 .",
    "this is the underlying assumption by both perkins [ 5 ] , and basuchowdhuri [ 7 ] .",
    "indeed , for a 2x2 real valued unitary transformation ( i.e. an orthogonal transformation ) , there is a limitation on its form .    consider a 2x2 transformation : @xmath11 then , for @xmath3 to be orthogonal ( unitary ) , @xmath12 .",
    "this gives rise to the following equations : @xmath13 these equations are satisfied only when @xmath3 has one of the two following forms : @xmath14 a rotation , as kak proposed , or @xmath15      \\mathbf{u_{2}(\\theta ) } =      \\begin{bmatrix }          cos(\\theta)&sin(\\theta)\\\\sin(\\theta)&-cos(\\theta )      \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] a reflection across the line @xmath16 .",
    "the three - stage protocol demands that while bob does nt know the value of @xmath8 that alice is using , he must know which of the two above forms of @xmath3 that alice chooses .",
    "the reason for this is that while @xmath17 commutes with @xmath18 for any @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath19 commutes with @xmath20 for any @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath17 does not commute with @xmath20 in general .",
    "so we will consider the choice of the form of @xmath3 to be public information .",
    "once this information is known , bob simply needs to choose his own angle @xmath9 , and his transformation @xmath4 will be of the same form as @xmath3 .",
    "+ @xmath21 + it is easy to see that when the same form is used , @xmath3 and @xmath4 commute ( i.e. @xmath22 )",
    ". + for form 1 : @xmath23\\ ] ] @xmath24 applying trigonometric identities , @xmath25 since @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same form , it is clear that they commute .",
    "+ for form 2 : @xmath26\\ ] ] @xmath27 again , applying trigonometric identities , @xmath28    since @xmath3 and @xmath4 always commute given the same form , then for eve to impersonate bob and obtain alice s secret message , she only needs to select any angle @xmath29 and use it in her own transformation @xmath10 where @xmath10 is of the same form as @xmath3 .",
    "using @xmath10 , eve can obtain the secret state @xmath0 in the exact same way that bob can obtain it .",
    "in addition , eve can relay a message to bob using her own @xmath10 transformation . since bob",
    "does nt know what alice s @xmath3 transformation is , eve s @xmath10 is a valid substitution .",
    "suppose now instead of a orthogonal ( i.e. unitary and real value ) transformation , alice chooses a more general complex valued unitary transformation , @xmath30 when alice chooses a @xmath3 of this form , it is more difficult for bob to find another transform , @xmath4 which commutes .",
    "we see that when @xmath31 then @xmath32 and @xmath33 these transformations commute only when @xmath34 ( or any 2@xmath35 multiple ) . for bob to decode alice s message , he must have more information than simply the form of her transformation .",
    "he must know also the value of @xmath8 that she has chosen .",
    "while this might seem to be a hindrence to the protocol , it allows for much greater security against a man in the middle attack .",
    "eve attempts to intercept alice s message to bob by choosing a @xmath10 to impersonate bob s @xmath4 . as we saw earlier , when @xmath3 is real valued",
    ", eve can simply pick any angle @xmath29 and generate a transformation @xmath10 that commutes . but with a complex valued @xmath3 , eve can not guarantee a commuting transformation without knowing the value of @xmath8 . consider eve s choice of a @xmath29 without knowledge of @xmath8 . then , @xmath36 .",
    "when , as in the variation to kak s protocol described above , bob knows the value of @xmath8 that alice has chosen for her transformation @xmath3 ( assuming as above that the form of @xmath3 is public information ) , then he has full knowledge of @xmath3 . in this situation",
    ", alice and bob can forego the second two stages of the protocol and let bob perform the transform @xmath5 to obtain the unknown state @xmath0 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we have simply , @xmath37 .",
    "in this situation , there is no need for @xmath3 to be complex valued .",
    "we can have , as kak proposed in [ 4 ] , @xmath38 so for eve to intercept the message @xmath0 and properly decode it , she would have to know the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the strength of this protocol is dependent on keeping the value of @xmath8 a secret known only to alice and bob .",
    "we enhance the security of our protocol by allowing for @xmath8 to change , which blocks any attempt by eve at a statistical analysis of the qubits .",
    "we assume that before secure transmission may begin , there is some other secure protocol that alice may use to transmit her initial value of @xmath8 to bob .",
    "one example is perkins protocol which uses trusted certificates [ 6 ] .",
    "suppose we restrict @xmath8 to the upper half plane of the unit circle .",
    "after @xmath39 qubits are successfully transmitted from alice to bob , the qubits @xmath40 to @xmath41 will be used to obtain the new value of @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath42 data bits selected by alice for these @xmath42 qubits will represent an integer @xmath43 such that if @xmath44 is the @xmath45th bit transmitted ( @xmath46 ) , then @xmath47 . when these four qubits are received by bob and decoded , alice and bob adjust their transformations @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively such that @xmath48 after this , alice transmits @xmath39 more qubits to bob before again changing the value of @xmath8 . in this fashion ,",
    "any attempt by eve to obtain the value of @xmath8 with no prior knowledge would be extremely difficult .",
