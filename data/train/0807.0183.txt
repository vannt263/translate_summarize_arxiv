    "since the isolation of 2-dimensional ( 2d ) graphene sheets in 2004 @xcite , there has been substantial interest in patterning them into quasi-1d graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) @xcite .",
    "this interest is motivated by the ability to tune the bandgap of gnrs by lithographic processes , and the consequent freedom it is expected to afford in lithographic bandgap - engineered electronic devices .",
    "gnrs as thin as @xmath0 nm have been achieved , exhibiting bandgaps approaching 0.3 - 0.4 ev , which makes them attractive for many low - power device applications @xcite .",

    "it is essential to identify the major sources of carrier scattering in thin gnrs . to that end",
    ", this work presents a comprehensive analysis of various scattering mechanisms in gnrs .",
    "analytical scattering rates for phonon , impurity , and line - edge roughness ( ler ) scattering are derived taking the gnr wavefunctions into account .",
    "it is shown that carrier mobilities in gnrs are not necessarily limited by edge roughness scattering ; similar to the case in 2d graphene , surface impurity @xcite and phonon scattering play important roles , depending on the carrier concentrations , widths , and temperature .",
    "the results of this work are expected to provide useful strategies towards improvements in carrier transport properties in gnrs for various applications .",

    ", we consider the zone - boundary phonon of energy @xmath102 mev , with an optical deformation potential @xmath103 ev / cm , assumed to be the same as for 2d graphene .",
    "optical phonon scattering is inelastic ; at low bias voltages and small electric fields , optical phonon emission by carriers is energetically forbidden , and absorption is damped by the high energy and low population of lo phonons . since the emission of optical phonons is possible only if the kinetic energy of carriers exceeds @xmath104 , this mechanism is important only for highly energetic carriers .",

    "= 3.3 in    since the scattering potential is only dependent on the longitudinal axis , the scattering is intra - subband .",
    "the square of matrix element of the nth subband is given by @xmath119 leading to a scattering rate @xmath120    since @xmath121 , the scattering rate is proportional to @xmath122 , and if the ler scattering rate is dominant , the mobility should scale with the width of the gnr as @xmath123 .",
    "this behavior contrasts with interface / surface roughness scattering in traditional semiconductors with parabolic bandstructures .",
    "since energy eigenvalues in such traditional semiconductors are proportional to @xmath124 , confinement of carriers into a length scale of @xmath24 leads to a roughness scattering limited mobility which scales as @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "thus , the bandstructure of gnrs make them _ inherently more robust _ to ler scattering than parabolic bandgap semiconductor nanostructures of comparable size .",
    "in addition to the the @xmath126 dependence of the ler scattering rate , the dependence on the roughness amplitude is @xmath127 . the factor @xmath128 is maximized for @xmath129 , indicating that ler scattering is the most severe for those carriers in the gnr that have fermi wavelengths of the same order as the correlation length of the fluctuations .",
    "= 3.3 in    the ler scattering rates evaluated for realistic gnrs are plotted in figure [ ler_scatrate ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "figure [ ler_scatrate ] ( a ) shows the ler scattering rate as a function of the roughness amplitude , ranging from @xmath1301% to @xmath13050% of the gnr width , for nominal gnr widths @xmath131 3 , 5 , 8 , & 12 nm . the correlation length for this plot is @xmath132 nm .",
    "figure [ ler_scatrate ] ( b ) illustrates the dependence of the scattering rate on the fermi - level ; as the fermi level in the gnr is increased by a gate voltage , the fermi - wavelength of carriers decrease , and therefore , ler scattering becomes more sensitive to roughness at shorter correlation lengths .",
    "therefore , for @xmath133 and for @xmath134 , the ler scattering rate is low .",
    "we note here that for very rough gnr edges characterized by @xmath135 , it is possible that carriers are localized in quantum - dot like confining potentials ; transport in such rough gnrs will occur by hopping and tunneling between localized states as opposed to diffusive band - transport ( see @xcite ) . the transport treated in this work",
    "is restricted to the diffusive band - transport regime .      due to an impurity charge located at @xmath136 with respect to the gnr which is on the @xmath137=0 plane ( see figure [ impscatfig ] ) , the unscreened scattering potential experienced by a mobile electron located at @xmath138 in the gnr is given by the coulomb potential @xmath139 where @xmath137 is the distance of the impurity from the gnr plane and @xmath63 is average relative dielectric constant of materials on the two sides of the gnr @xcite .",
    "the distance of the impurity from the origin is @xmath140 .",
    "the _ screened _ impurity perturbation matrix element is then given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the change in the carrier wavevector along the gnr axis upon scattering , and @xmath143 is the zeroth order modified bessel function , and @xmath144 is the screening factor in equation [ screeningfactor ] .    in order to get the scattering rate due to all impurities , we integrate over the distribution of impurities . for the most general distribution of impurities , the scattering rate is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is an effective scattering ` cross - section ' with dimensions of length , given by @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the volume - density of the impurities which can vary with the distance from the gnr plane , @xmath149 is the thickness over which the impurities are distributed .",
    "this general formalism allows us to evaluate , at the same time , the effect of scattering by volume - distributed impurities as well as impurities located at the gnr surface .",
    "if the charged impurities are located at the gnr / dielectric interface or on the gnr surface , then the scattering rate is found unambiguously by taking @xmath150 and @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the 2d impurity density .",
    "for the evaluation of the scattering rates in the rest of the paper , we consider the volume ( bulk ) and surface impurities separately to highlight their relative importance .",
    "this is motivated by the recent finding that for 2d graphene , surface impurities are responsible for low - field mobility , and when they are removed , an order of magnitude improvement in mobility is observed , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "= 2.3 in    the rates for each type of scattering mechanism are first evaluated as a function of carrier energy to gauge their relative importance .",
    "they are plotted in figure [ scatrates ] for a gnr of @xmath153 nm width at @xmath154 k. the relevant parameters used for the calculation are a edge roughness characterized by @xmath155 nm , a bulk impurity density @xmath156/@xmath157 , and a surface impurity density @xmath158/@xmath93 .",
    "in addition to the individual scattering rates , the total scattering rate obtained by matheissens rule as a sum of the individual scattering rates is also shown . for the specific case of the parameters chosen ,",
    "the ler scattering is seen to dominate at low carrier energies , followed by coustic phonon and surface impurity scattering .",
    "the effect of bulk impurities is found to be relatively weak compared to ler and surface impurities .",
    "it is possible to experimentally lower ( or eliminate ) scattering due to ler , bulk , and surface impurities , as they are not _ intrinsic _ to the gnr , and such techniques are expected to be developed in due course .",
    "the intrinsic scattering mechanisms - due to acoustic and optical phonons , are also shown in the figure . due to the dependence of the scattering rates on the 1d dos of the gnr ,",
    "the general trend is a decrease of scattering rates as the energy of the state increases from the band edge ( @xmath159 ) , and then the appearance of a step at the onset of the next subband .",
    "when the energy of a state is @xmath160 , optical phonon emission is allowed , and for such high energy states , optical phonon scattering dominates over all other scattering mechanisms .",
    "this is especially important at high - bias conditions , when high - energy states are occupied .",
    "optical phonon scattering is responsible for the saturation of current flow through the gnr , leading to a sharp degradation of carrier mobility .",
    "the same has been found earlier for carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "we restrict the rest of the discussion here to low - bias mobilities .",
    "= 3.3 in    using the formalism for the calculation of carrier mobilities outlined in section [ formalism ] , the carrier mobility is calculated for a 5 nm wide gnr as a function of temperature for three different locations of the fermi level .",
    "the impurity densities used in this calculation are @xmath156/@xmath157 and @xmath158/@xmath93 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ mob5 nm ] .",
    "when the fermi level is located in the bandgap at @xmath161 from the dirac point , the carrier mobility is severely affected by surface impurity scattering at low temperatures as seen in figure [ mob5nm](a ) . above @xmath130200",
    "k , acoustic phonon scattering dominates the scattering rate .",
    "the dominance of surface impurity scattering for this case is due to the fact that when @xmath161 and the temperature is low , the net mobile electron density in the conduction band is low , and screening is weak . as the fermi level is raised to the conduction band edge - @xmath162 ( figure [ mob5nm](b ) ) and then above it - @xmath163 ( figure [ mob5nm](c ) ) , surface coulomb impurities are strongly screened , and ler scattering dominates at low temperatures . at and around room temperature",
    ", acoustic phonon scattering still limits the electron mobility .",
    "the effect of ler scattering is felt only when the surface impurity density is low .",
    "the surface impurity scattering rate scales inversely with the density of impurities ; thus if the surface impurity density is much higher , say @xmath164/@xmath93 , it becomes the dominant scattering mechanism , limiting the room temperature mobility to @xmath165 @xmath93/v.s .",
    "mobilities in this range has been recently reported in ultrathin gnrs @xcite , but due to the lack of experimental evidence of the gnr edge roughness of such samples , it is early to make a direct comparison .",
    "however , from the analysis , it can be concluded that such values of mobilities are not _ intrinsic _ , and result from either ler or surface impurity scattering .",
    "= 3.3 in    if the width of the gnr is lowered to @xmath166 nm but with a roughness the same as the 5 nm wide gnr , ler scattering becomes stronger .",
    "figure [ mob3 nm ] depicts the relative importance of the various scattering mechanisms at different temperature for three locations of the fermi level .",
    "as can be seen , ler scattering starts dominating at and around room temperature as well , overtaking acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "if one considers the case when surface and bulk impurities are absent , the mobility will be determined by the relative importance of acoustic phonon and ler scattering .    finally , if the surface impurity density is lowered to a level @xmath167/@xmath93 , the ler and acoustic phonon scattering mechanisms are of the most interest .",
    "under such a condition , the mobility is plotted as a function of the gnr width for a constant edge roughness in figure [ mobintrinsic ] .",
    "the crossover of the ler and acoustic phonon scattering rates occurs at @xmath168 nm for the chosen edge roughness parameters .",
    "for narrow ribbons , ler scattering dominates , but as the width of the gnr is increased , the ler scattering rate decreases as @xmath169 , making the gnrs of widths 5 nm and above relatively insensitive to edge roughness scattering . as @xmath170 , the acoustic phonon scattering rate limit on the mobility approaches that of 2d graphene ; indeed , mobilities as high as 120,000 @xmath93/v.s have been recently observed in suspended 2d graphene sheets when the surface impurities were removed by current - induced annealing @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , it is shown from analytical modeling that low - field carrier transport in gnrs is affected by intrinsic scattering by acoustic phonons , in addition to line edge roughness and impurity scattering .",
    "impurities sticking to the gnr surface or at the interface of gnrs and underlying substrates are much more deleterious than those embedded in the underlying substrate .",
    "for very thin gnrs , the mobility is degraded by ler scattering , which reduces the mobility as the fourth power of the gnr width . for many technologically relevant gnr widths ,",
    "ler scattering is weaker than the intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering .",

    "fringing fields are neglected here due to the 1d geometry of the gnr .",
    "this approximation does not have a major impact on the dominant scattering rate determination , since bulk impurity scattering is found to be weaker than the surface impurity ."
