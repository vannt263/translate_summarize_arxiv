[ ] to derive an approximate expression for the resistivity that highlights its scaling properties , @xmath208 \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{t_{{\\footnotesize k}}}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath209 is the bcft kondo scale and the prefactors are in correspondence with the precise definition of this scale as given in our previous work . it is important to remark again that the asymptotic expansion for small temperatures is valid only for @xmath210 . for consistency ,",
    "the same definition of the kondo scale @xcite was used for both plots in figs .  1 and 2 ( the prefactors in the definition are of course not universal and depend on the particular convention ) .",
    "it is here interesting to discuss the experimentally measured low-@xmath126 resistivity of the thoriated @xmath0 compound , mentioned in the introduction , which shows a @xmath1 behavior but with a positive coefficient .",
    "as discussed in refs .",
    "[ ] , this would imply that in the ( single - impurity ) kondo model framework this system exhibits a strong electron - impurity coupling ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "it was speculated that such a regime was achievable near mixed valence in the context of the ( single - impurity ) two - channel anderson model ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for a review ) . our results , however , do not support those ideas .",
    "perhaps , since @xmath211@xmath212@xmath0 with @xmath213 is far from the dilute limit , lattice effects might play a role in reversing the sign of that coefficient .",
    "while later measurements on the same compound have confirmed the @xmath1 behavior with a positive coefficient @xcite , on the other hand , a @xmath1 scaling of the resistivity with a negative coefficient has been recently observed in a different uranium - based heavy - fermion material , @xmath214 ( but only for large dopings , @xmath215 @xcite , when a single - impurity description of the low - temperature physics is not always expected ) .",
    "in a previous article @xcite we presented the technical details of the bcft solution of the two - channel anderson model and discussed its asymptotic low - temperature thermodynamics . in that context",
    "we were able to make the connection with the full solution obtained using the thermodynamic bethe - ansatz formalism and could explicitly match the scaling fields with the microscopic parameters of the lattice hamiltonian .",
    "here we completed the task by calculating dynamical- and transport - related quantities ( the single - electron green s function , the electron and impurity self - energies , and the resistivity ) . using our previous results from ref .",
    "[ ] , these quantities are parametrized directly in terms of the energy difference between impurity configurations in the original hamiltonian ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we have shown , in particular , how our analytic expression for the impurity self - energy captures the low - frequency behavior in agreement with the results of other nonperturbative techniques like wilson s numerical renormalization group method @xcite . as we mentioned in the introduction , having reliable access to transport quantities is of crucial importance for the comparison and interpretation of experiments that continue to seek indisputable realizations of multi - channel kondo physics .",
    "the work presented here furthers our understanding of two - channel kondo physics in mixed - valent scenarios , thus widening the range of possible candidate systems for experimental realizations .",
    "we would like to thank f.  b.  anders for discussions about his recent nrg results for this model and for useful correspondence .",
