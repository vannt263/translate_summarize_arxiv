    "high - energy electrons emit the specific radiation while penetrating through single crystals .",
    "the shape of the spectrum and the intensity of this radiation depend on the electron energy and crystal orientation .",
    "this phenomenon has been widely investigated theoretically and experimentally ( see e.g. , @xcite and references cited there ) .",
    "photon beams obtained in such a way may be used , for example , in photo - production experiments of different kind . in particular , they may serve as @xmath0 - beams in @xmath1-colliders .    in this paper , we focus on the polarization properties of emitted photons as the polarization offers additional opportunities in the experimental study .",
    "initial electrons are assumed to be unpolarized .",
    "then , using crystals , only linear polarization may be obtained .",
    "we start with the well known formula derived by means of the quasi - classical operator method ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remember , that within this method the probabilities of qed processes may be expressed by way of classical trajectories of charged particles , provided that the external field involved satisfies some conditions specified in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the electric field of a crystal responsible for the coherent processes satisfies these conditions . in this stage",
    ", we have to solve a two  -  dimensional mechanical problem .",
    "further consideration exploits the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the mechanical problem mentioned becomes essentially one  -  dimensional for the angles of incidence ( w.r.t . some major crystal axis ) , @xmath2 , which satisfy the condition @xmath3 .",
    "the magnitude of the angle @xmath4 depends on the electron energy and the axis chosen .",
    "it was accurately determined in @xcite being sufficiently larger than the characteristic angle for axial channelling .",
    "note that the region @xmath5 is not interesting here , as we do not expect any polarization of the radiation from unpolarized electrons at axial channelling . in the angular region of interest ,",
    "a finite set of the most strong planes containing the axis is important .",
    "moreover , the azimuthal angle domains , where the influence of the planes on a motion should be taken into account exactly , do not overlap",
    ". then we have for the transverse ( w.r.t .",
    "the axis ) velocity of an electron : @xmath6 . in this expansion",
    ", the first term represents the exact solution for the transverse velocity in the field of the only one plane of the set .",
    "the second term gives the contribution of other planes which can be taken into account using a perturbation theory and , additionally , the rectilinear trajectory approximation .",
    "note that periods of the one  -  dimensional motion ( `` slow '' ) are noticeably larger then those in the perturbation term ( `` fast '' ) .",
    "the slow component is present when the velocity is almost aligned with one of the planes .",
    "it disappears when the velocity of a particle forms sufficiently large angles with each plane of the set . in this case",
    ", the perturbation theory in the whole crystal potential is applicable being the essence of the so called coherent bremsstrahlung ( cb ) theory .",
    "it is clear that the transverse motion of a particle is two  -  dimensional but the component which needs the exact calculation is one  -  dimensional . to find the latter ,",
    "we propose the new approximate form of the actual plane potential which provides the precise fit for any crystal plane and allows one to find an analytic expression for the trajectory . that is done in appendix a where also the explicit form of the velocity fourier - transform is obtained .    in section 2 ,",
    "general expressions are derived giving the instantaneous ( probabilities per unite time or length ) characteristics of the radiation",
    ". then they are analyzed and simplified .",
    "we discuss the qualitative features of the phenomenon and present results of numerical calculations for thin crystals .",
    "it turns out , that , for the two types of the azimuthal orientation mentioned above , not only spectra but also polarization distributions are utterly different . in a practical use , sufficiently thick crystals are needed to get a noticeable yield . in this case , we can not neglect the multiple photon emission , their absorbtion due to the @xmath7-pair production , and the radiative energy loss of charged particles . in other words , for thick crystals , we must consider the @xmath8-shower .",
    "such a consideration is performed in section 3 , using the formulas obtained in section 2 along with those describing the @xmath7-pair production by polarized photons .",
    "so , we describe the shower development , taking into account the polarization of photons for both basic qed - processes involved .",
    "some results of monte - carlo simulations are presented for settings used in na43 ( see @xcite ) and na59 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) experiments at cern .",
    "the consideration performed allows one to decide for the optimal crystal type , thickness , and orientation providing necessary characteristics of a polarized photon source .",
    "let us start with the well known formula ( see , e.g. , eq.(16.7 ) in @xcite ) which describes spectral , angular , and polarization distributions of photons emitted by unpolarized electrons ( positrons ) at given motion : @xmath9\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the photon momentum , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the electron energy , and @xmath16(\\varphi ( \\varepsilon ) -2 ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the electron velocity on the classical trajectory @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the electron mass , @xmath20 .",
    "if we set @xmath21 ( @xmath22)in the expression for @xmath23 , the formula ( [ photen ] ) will describe the radiation from the scalar ( zero - spin ) particle ( see e.g. , part 9 in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this substitution rule holds for all subsequent formulas in this section .",
    "remember that the vectors @xmath24 in eq.([ltt ] ) correspond to the polarization which would be measured by some detector and , thereby , have nothing to do with the polarization of emitted photons .",
    "the latter is described by the matrix , @xmath25 in the contraction @xmath26 .",
    "we introduce the vector , @xmath27 ( @xmath28),which describes the analyzing ability of a detector , by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 can be presented in the same form : @xmath31 .",
    "then we have @xmath32 in this equation , the stokes vector of the radiation , @xmath33 , is defined .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 gives the value of @xmath35 summed up over polarizations .",
    "we assume further that the angular divergence of the electron beam is small enough .",
    "then the same is true for arising photon beam provided that electron energy is sufficiently large ( @xmath36 ) , as the emission angle of a photon ( w.r.t .",
    "the particle velocity ) is typically of the order of @xmath37 . in this case , we can choose some axis ( z - axis ) such that the momenta of all charged particles and photons make small angles,@xmath38 , w.r.t . this axis:@xmath39",
    "let @xmath40 denotes the component of an arbitrary vector @xmath41 transverse to the axis chosen .",
    "using relations @xmath42 we can remove z - components of all the vectors from eq .",
