    "it is nothing less but exhilarating to contemplate future neutrino detectors reaching effective volumes of @xmath0tons and effective areas of @xmath1@xmath2 by exploiting totally novel detection methods such as radio , acoustic , atmospheric fluorescence and horizontal air shower techniques .",
    "this is at a time when we are operating a single neutrino telescope of only @xmath3@xmath4 effective area , depending on the science  @xcite .",
    "its extension to a kilometer - scale neutrino observatory , icecube , is still at the proposal stage .",
    "neutrino detectors can be classified in four categories , which are delineated by the energy for which the instruments have been optimized :    1 .",
    "* mev * detectors : for studying the sun and detecting supernovae , 2 .",
    "* gev  tev * dumand - class telescopes : possibly , the first instruments to look beyond the sun , but , more importantly , with sufficiently low threshold to demonstrate the novel techniques that use ice and water as a cherenkov medium by detecting atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "amanda is the first in this category , others will be commissioned in mediterranean waters , 3 .",
    "* tev  pev * kilometer - scale observatories such as icecube@xcite .",
    "these represent , as far as we know , the best - buy for opening up the field of high energy neutrino astronomy , 4 .",
    "* eev * detectors specializing in answering the mystifying questions raised by the existence of 100eev cosmic rays , and the apparent absence of a greisen cutoff .",
    "although optimized in different energy bands , the missions of these instruments can overlap . in this",
    "talk we discuss the potential of icecube to do the science envisaged for the projects of interest to this meeting , such as the radio observatories , the auger air shower array and the space - based atmospheric fluorescence detector owl .",
    "these discussions are important for two reasons : i ) for exploring the full potential of a detector , possibly beyond the specific goals it was designed for , and ii ) in order to avoid compromising the performance of an instrument by concentrating on science better done by others . while i ) is obvious , ii ) is important and often controversial .",
    "for instance , should one consider the study of oscillating atmospheric neutrinos , superbly performed with superkamiokande - type detectors , when optimizing the performance a high energy neutrino telescope ?",
    "as far as astronomy beyond the gev signals of egret is concerned , the case for using neutrinos as messengers is compelling@xcite . of all high - energy particles , only weakly interacting neutrinos can directly convey astronomical information from the edge of the universe and from deep inside the most cataclysmic high - energy processes . copiously produced in high - energy collisions ,",
    "travelling at the velocity of light , and undeflected by magnetic fields , neutrinos meet the basic requirements for astronomy .",
    "their unique advantage arises from a fundamental property : they are affected only by the weakest of nature s forces ( but for gravity ) and are therefore essentially unabsorbed as they travel cosmological distances between their origin and us .",
    "the first suggestions that kilometer - size neutrino telescopes were required to do the science originated with early estimates of the flux produced by the highest energy cosmic rays interacting with microwave photons . with time , and after consideration of the diverse scientific missions of astroparticle physics with high energy neutrinos , we have confirmed that the science does require construction of a kilometer - scale neutrino detector , and the challenge has therefore been one of technology .",
    "the only demonstrated solution is to use a `` natural '' detector consisting of a thousand billion liters ( a teraliter ) of instrumented natural water or ice . after commissioning and operating",
    "the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) , the amanda collaboration is ready to meet this challenge and has proposed to construct icecube , a one - cubic - kilometer international high - energy neutrino observatory in the clear deep ice below the south pole station .",
    "icecube will be an array of 4,800 optical modules within a cubic kilometer of clear ice .",
    "frozen into holes 2.4 kilometers deep , to be drilled by hot water , the uppermost optical modules will lie 1,400 m below the surface .",
    "simulations anchored to amanda data show that the direction of muon tracks can be reconstructed to 0.5 degrees above 1pev .",
    "icecube will be capable of identifying neutrino type , or flavor , by mapping showers of cherenkov light from electron and from tau neutrinos .",
    "most important , it will measure neutrino energy .",
    "energy resolution is critical , because there should be very little background from atmospheric neutrinos at energies above 100 tev .",
    "in this talk we concentrate on super - eev science such as topological defects , super - heavy relics and neutrinos associated with the greisen cutoff . their detection is usually not considered as a high priority in designing the architecture of neutrino telescopes .",
    "it has been realized for some time that topological defects are unlikely to be the origin of the structure in the present universe @xcite .",
    "therefore the direct observation of their decay products , in the form of cosmic rays or high energy neutrinos , becomes the only way to search for these remnant structures from grand unified phase transitions@xcite .",
    "this search represents an example of fundamental particle physics that can only be done with cosmic beams .",
    "we here point out that a kilometer - scale neutrino observatory , such as icecube , has excellent discovery potential for topological defects .",
    "the instrument can identify the characteristic signatures in the energy and zenith angle distribution of the signal events .",
    "our conclusions for topological defects extend to other physics associated with @xmath5ev energies .    to benchmark the performance of icecube relative to owl@xcite , chosen as an example of an instrument optimized to @xmath6eev energy ,",
    "we use the following theorized sources of super - eev neutrinos :    * generic topological defects with grand - unified mass scale @xmath7 of order @xmath8gev and a particle decay spectrum consistent with all present observational constraints@xcite , * superheavy relics @xcite , which we normalize to the z - burst scenario@xcite where the observed cosmic rays with @xmath9ev energy , and above , are locally produced by the interaction of super - energetic neutrinos with the cosmic neutrino background , * neutrinos produced by superheavy relics which themselves decay into the highest energy cosmic rays@xcite , and * the flux of neutrinos produced in the interactions of cosmic rays with the microwave background@xcite .",
    "this flux , which originally inspired the concept of a kilometer - scale neutrino detector , is mostly shown for comparison .",
    "our results are summarized in table 1 where we compare the event rates for icecube , discussed later , with those for owl calculated in reference@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is clear , while effective volume and area for owl apparently exceed those of icecube by many orders of magnitude , the events rates are comparable .",
    "this is a consequence of the duty cycle , reduced efficiency , and higher threshold of the owl detector .    .65em",
    ".comparison of neutrino event rates for three representative neutrino fluxes for owl@xcite and icecube@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 1 shows the @xmath10 fluxes used in the calculations .",
    "we first calculate the event rates corresponding to the largest flux from topological defects @xcite allowed by constraints imposed by the measured diffuse @xmath11-ray background in the vicinity of 100 mev .",
    "the corresponding proton flux has been normalized to the observed cosmic ray spectrum at @xmath12ev ; see fig.2 of reference @xcite .",
    "models with @xmath13 appear to be ruled out @xcite and hence they are not considered in the calculation . as an example of neutrino production by superheavy relic particles , we consider the model of gelmini and kusenko @xcite . in figs.2 and 3",
    "we show the event rates as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "we assume a muon energy threshold of 1 pev .",
    "we also show in both plots the event rate corresponding to the waxman and bahcall  bound \" @xcite .",
    "this bound represents the maximal flux from astrophysical , optically thin sources , in which neutrinos are produced in @xmath14-@xmath14 or @xmath14-@xmath11 collisions .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino events are not shown since they are negligible above the muon energy threshold we are using .",
    "the area under the curves in both figures is equal to the number of events for each source . in fig.4",
    "we plot the event rates in which the produced muon arrives at the detector with an energy greater than @xmath15(threshold ) .",
    "in fig.5 we finally present the angular distribution of the neutrino events for the different sources .",
    "the characteristic shape of the distribution reflects the opacity of the earth to high energy neutrinos , typically above @xmath16100 tev .",
    "the limited column density of matter in the atmosphere essentially reduces the rate of downgoing neutrinos to interactions in the 1.5 km of ice above the detector .",
    "the events are therefore concentrated near the horizontal direction corresponding to zenith angles close to @xmath17 .",
    "the neutrinos predicted by the model of gelmini and kusenko are so energetic that they are absorbed , even in the horizontal direction as can be seen in fig.5 .",
    "energy measurement is critical for achieving the sensitivity of the detector claimed . for muons , the energy resolution of icecube",
    "is anticipated to be @xmath18 in the logarithm of the energy , possibly better .",
    "the detector is definitely able to determine energy to better than an order of magnitude , sufficient for the separation of eev signals from atmospheric neutrinos with energies below 100 tev .",
    "notice that one should also be able to identify electromagnetic showers initiated by electron and tau - neutrinos .",
    "the energy response for showers is linear , and expected to be better than 20% .",
    "such eev events will be gold - plated , unfortunately their fluxes are expected to be even lower .",
    "for instance for the first td model in table 2 ( p=1 , @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 ) , we expect @xmath21 contained shower per year per @xmath2 above 1 pev initiated in charged current interactions of @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding number for the gelmini and kusenko flux is @xmath23 .",
    "one should also worry about the fact that a very high energy muon may enter the detector with reduced energy because of energy losses .",
    "it can , in principle , become indistinguishable from a minimum ionizing muon of atmospheric origin @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the ionization as well as catastrophic muon energy losses which are incorporated in the calculation of the range of the muon . in the pev regime region",
    "this energy reduction is roughly one order of magnitude , it should be less for the higher energies considered here .    in conclusion ,",
    "if the fluxes predicted by our sample of models for neutrino production in the super - eev region are representative , they should be revealed by the icecube observatory operated over several years .",
