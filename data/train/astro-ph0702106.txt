    "among the high energy ( above tens mev ) afterglow of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) detected so far , that of grb 940217 is the longest and also the most energetic one .",
    "the sub - gev emission lasted more than 5000 seconds and it included also a 18 gev photon @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in the energy range @xmath1 to 18 gev , can not be fitted with a simple power law ( see fig .",
    "3 of hurley et al .",
    "a new spectral component in the energy range larger than several tens mev is needed .",
    "this finding motivates many interesting ideas : ( i ) the interaction of ultra - relativistic protons with a dense cloud @xcite , ( ii ) synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) scattering in early forward / reverse shocks or during the prompt emission @xcite and ( iii ) an electromagnetic cascade of tev @xmath2rays in the infrared / microwave background @xcite .",
    "however , the two important observation facts : ( a ) the count rate of high energy photons is almost a constant ( b ) the typical energy of these photons is nearly unchanged , have not been satisfactorily reproduced .    to interpret the unusual high energy afterglow of grb 940217 , the physical processes involved in the early grb afterglow phase",
    "is highly needed .",
    "the successful launch of the _ swift _ satellite did open a new window to reveal what happens in the early grb afterglow phase . as summarized in zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and nousek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in a canonical _ swift _ grb x - ray afterglow lightcurve some interesting features are emerging , including the very early sharp decline ( i.e. , phase - i ) , a shallow decline of the x - ray afterglow ( i.e. , phase - ii ) , and the energetic x - ray flares ( i.e. , phase - v ) . the interpretation and the implication of these features",
    "have been discussed in great detail ( see mszros 2006 ; piran & fan 2007 ; zhang 2007 for recent reviews ) . for phase - ii , which interests us here ,",
    "a widely considered explanation is a significant energy injection @xmath3 ( see zhang et al . 2006 and nousek et al . 2006 and the references therein ) .",
    "however , the energy injection process , if there is , seems to be not all the story . as shown in fan & piran ( 2006 ) , for some grbs with good quality multi - wavelength afterglow data , the x - ray and optical light curves break chromatically and thus challenge the energy injection model ( see also panaitescu 2006 , huang .",
    "an assumption additional to the energy injection to solve such a puzzle is that the shock parameter(s ) may be shock strength dependent ( i.e. , time - dependent ) .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) radiation of the external forward shock undergoing a significant energy injection .",
    "the shock parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the fraction of shock energy given to the shocked electrons and magnetic field , are assumed to be time - dependent .",
    "we show the high energy afterglow of grb 940217 could be given rise to in such a scenario .",
    "in this section we calculate the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) radiation of the external forward shock undergoing a significant energy injection and evolving shock parameters .",
    "* synchrotron radiation . * as usual , we assume that the electrons accelerated by the shock would follow the power law distribution @xmath6 for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the minimum lorentz factor of shocked electrons ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) . then following yost ( 2003 ) and",
    "fan & piran ( 2006 ) , the observed typical frequency of synchrotron radiation is @xmath9 . where @xmath10 is the redshift of the grb , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy fraction occupied by the electrons and magnetic field respectively",
    ", @xmath11 is the isotropic energy , @xmath12 is the observer time . here",
    "the convention @xmath13 has been adopted in cgs units throughout the text , and we have taken the spectral index of the electron distribution @xmath14 . the observed cooling frequency is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the surrounding medium density , @xmath17/2 $ ] is the compton parameter , @xmath18 ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "the peak flux is @xmath19 . where @xmath20 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath21 cm .",
    "so in the fast cooling phase ( @xmath22 ) the light curve is ( sari 1998 ) : @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "while in the slow cooling phase ( @xmath29 ) the light curve is : @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "please note that in previous works the evolution of the compton parameter @xmath36 has always been ignored .",
    "however , if @xmath37 , then the effect of @xmath36 evolution should be considered . from the relation",
    "@xmath38 we know that , in the fast cooling phase , @xmath39 , then @xmath36 is independent of the time , while in the slow cooling phase @xmath36 should evolve with time .",
    "@xmath40 , then we get    @xmath41    so we find @xmath42 , then @xmath43 , and so we have @xmath44 for @xmath35 .",
    "* the ssc emission . * the effect of ssc process on grb afterglow emission has been discussed by several authors ( e.g. wei & lu 1998 , 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "the typical frequency of ssc emission is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the minimum lorentz factor of shocked electrons , @xmath47 is the bulk lorentz factor , the cooling lorentz factor @xmath48 , then the cooling frequency of ssc emission is @xmath49    the peak flux of the ssc emission is ( sari & esin 2001 ) @xmath50    therefore , in the fast cooling phase , the light curve is @xmath51    and in the slow cooling phase , the light curve is @xmath52    again , if considering @xmath36 evolution , then , @xmath53 for @xmath54 .      *",
    "a. the ssc emission with energy injection .",
    "* in the standard fireball model , the shock energy @xmath11 is assumed to be constant . however , there are increasing evidences that the shock energy may increase with time during some period .",
    "one good example is the discovery of the `` shallow decay phase '' in the early x - ray light curves of many grbs , which is usually attributed to the energy injection ( zhang 2006 ; nousek 2006 ) .",
    "now we consider the case that there is significant continuous energy injection into the fireball , so the fireball decelerates less rapidly and the afterglow emission will show a shallow decline . the dynamical evolution and the synchrotron radiation signature for energy injection have been discussed by many authors ( rees & mszros 1998 ; dai & lu 1998 ; cohen & piran 1999 ; zhang & mszros 2001a ; zhang 2006 ; nousek 2006 ; fan & xu 2006 ) .    here",
    "we assume the energy injection takes a form @xmath55 @xcite , then the fireball energy evolves with time as @xmath56 , the fireball radius @xmath57 , the minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath58 , the observed typical frequency of synchrotron radiation @xmath59 , the cooling lorentz factor @xmath60 , and the observed cooling frequency of synchrotron radiation @xmath61 , the peak flux @xmath62 .",
    "the typical frequency of ssc emission is @xmath63 , the cooling frequency of ssc emission is @xmath64 , and the peak flux of ssc radiation is @xmath65 . using these relations , we can get the light curves of synchrotron radiation and ssc emission with energy injection .",
    "* b. the ssc emission with evolving shock parameters .",
    "* in the standard fireball model , the shock parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are assumed to be constant . however , it is also possible that these quantities may vary with time .",
    "yost ( 2003 ) , fan & piran ( 2006 ) and ioka ( 2006 ) have discussed the afterglow emission with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being time - dependent . by modeling the afterglow of several grbs , it was found that the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the forward shock are quite different from that of reverse shock ( fan 2002 ; zhang , kobayashi & mszros 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; wei 2006 ) .",
    "we note that the forward shock is ultra - relativistic , while the reverse shock is mild - relativistic , so this result suggests that the shock parameters may be correlated with the strength of the shock .",
    "following fan & piran ( 2006 ) , here we simply assume @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and since @xmath68 , so @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "then we can obtain the light curve of synchrotron radiation and ssc emission .",
    "* c. the ssc emission with both the above effects .",
    "* it is also possible that during the shock evolution , both the shock energy and the shock parameters evolve with time . based on the previous analysis ,",
    "we can obtain the synchrotron radiation and ssc emission light curves easily .",
    "table 1 gives the temporal index @xmath71 of the afterglow emission , where @xmath72 is adopted .",
    "we define @xmath73 , where @xmath74 corresponds to the contribution of the standard emission , @xmath75 represents the contribution of the energy injection , @xmath76 stands for the contribution of evolving shock parameters , and @xmath77 comes from the evolution of compton parameter y. for example , if we only consider energy injection , then @xmath78 . if only evolving shock parameters is considered , then @xmath79 . if both the effects are considered , then @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath37 , then the term @xmath77 should be included .",
    "grb940217 was a very famous burst for its long - lasting high energy afterglow emission ( hurley 1994 ) .",
    "the high energy photons ( @xmath81 mev ) were recorded for about 5400 seconds , including an 18 gev photon @xmath82 4500s after the low energy emission had ended .",
    "the 30 mev to 30 gev egret spectrum is @xmath83 , excluding the 18 gev photon . by integrating this spectrum ,",
    "the fluence at @xmath84 mev is @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , for this grb there are two important observation facts : ( a ) the count rate of high energy photons is almost a constant ; ( b ) the typical energy of these photons is nearly unchanged .",
    "this two facts imply that the flux should be nearly a constant @xmath86 .    based on the above analysis , if we assume that the energy injection occurred at time @xmath87 500s , and we take the parameters as follows : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , then at this time , the typical frequency of ssc emission is @xmath93 mev , the cooling frequency of ssc emission is @xmath94 gev , and the peak flux of ssc emission is @xmath95 , which is quite agreement with the observation .",
    "in addition , we note that the observed photon energies lie between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and since the spectrum is very soft , @xmath98 , so the index of electron distribution is @xmath99 . from table 1",
    "we can find that , in the standard case , the flux would decrease with time as @xmath100 , which is obviously inconsistent with the observation .",
    "if we consider energy injection , then @xmath101 , since @xmath102 , so the flux would decay steeper than @xmath103 , which is still inconsistent with the observation .",
    "then , there is only one choice - the shock parameters should evolve with time .",
    "if we take @xmath104 ( which is suggested by the recent _ swift _ xrt data , see zhang 2006 ) , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , then the flux would be nearly a constant , which is agreement with the observation .    in order to investigate the ssc emission more carefully , fan ( 2007 )",
    "have developed a numerical code to calculate the compton process self - consistently for grb high energy afterglow emission . using this code",
    ", we calculate the ssc emission numerically , the result has been shown in fig.1 , the parameter are : the initial kinetic energy is @xmath107 erg , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the energy injection form is taken to be @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at late times",
    ", the energy injection disappears and @xmath116 . from fig.1",
    "we find that the numerical results are consistent with the analytic estimates and can well account for the observation ( both the light curve and the spectrum ) of grb940217 .",
    "since its discovery , the long - lasting high energy afterglow emission of grb 940217 has been extensively discussed ( e.g. katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1994 ; plaga 1995 ; cheng & cheng 1996 ; dermer 2000 ; wang et al .",
    "2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001b ; guetta & granot 2003 ; peer & waxman 2004 ) . however , we note that the ssc emission of the standard afterglow model can not well account for the observation of grb940217 . for example , dermer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) calculated the synchrotron - self - compton emission during the blast wave propagation , but their spectrum is very hard , which is inconsistent with the observation of grb 940217 . as shown in tab.1 , the flux of ssc emission would decrease with time as @xmath100 for a @xmath117 that is needed to reproduce the very steep mev to gev spectrum , even when considering the energy injection , the flux would still decay steeper than @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the nearly constant of the high energy flux strongly suggests that other physical processes should be involved , such as the evolution of shock parameters and/or energy injection considered in this paper .",
    "some possible energy injection processes have been proposed in rees & mszros ( 1998 ) and dai & lu ( 1998 ) , while the possible physical scenario giving rise to the time - evolving shock parameters are far from clear @xcite .",
    "the peculiar chromatic break detected in quite a few early x - ray and optical afterglow data @xcite , however , did indicate such a possibility .    in previous analysis ,",
    "the dependence of the compton parameter @xmath36 on time has always been ignored . however , from table 1 we can see that , in some cases , the influence of @xmath36 evolution can not be ignored . for example , in the standard case ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , i.e. without energy injection and the shock parameters are constant ) , the light curves of synchrotron radiation ( @xmath35 ) and ssc emission ( @xmath54 ) will be flattened by @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively for @xmath14 . if @xmath122 , then the effect will be more prominent , the light curves of synchrotron radiation ( @xmath35 ) and ssc emission ( @xmath54 ) will be flattened by @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "so under some circumstances , the effect of @xmath36 evolution should be considered .",
    "glast will be lunched soon , and it is expected that glast will detect high energy emission ( 20 mev to 300 gev ) of grbs , which may open a new window to understand the physical processes occurred in grbs . we hope that glast can detect more events like grb940217 , and this can provide important clues to explore the nature of grbs ( see fan 2007 for extensive discussions ) .",
