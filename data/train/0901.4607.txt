    "the discovery of superconductivity ( sc ) in the iron ( fe)-based oxypnictide lafeaso@xmath14f@xmath15 , reaching a superconducting transition temperature @xmath11 = 26 k , has attracted considerable interest in the fields of condensed - matter physics and material science @xcite . shortly after this discovery , it was reported that @xmath11 of lafeaso@xmath16f@xmath17 increases up to 43 k upon the application of pressure @xcite , and the replacement of the la site by other rare earth ( re ) elements significantly increases @xmath11 up to more than 50 k @xcite .",
    "these findings have provided a new material base for searching high-@xmath11 sc .",
    "the structure of mother materials contains an alternate stacking of re@xmath3o@xmath3 and fe@xmath3as@xmath3 layers along the c - axis where the fe atoms of the feas layer are located in a fourfold coordination forming a feas@xmath18 tetrahedron .",
    "the mother material lafeaso is a semimetal with a stripe antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order with @xmath19 or @xmath20 @xcite . the substitution of fluorine for oxygen and/or oxygen deficiencies at the lao layer yield a novel sc @xcite .",
    "in particular , a very sharp superconducting transition in resistance under @xmath21 for ndfeaso@xmath1 ensures a homogeneous electronic state even in an oxygen - deficient sample @xcite .",
    "remarkably , lee et al . found that @xmath10 increases to the maximum value of 54 k when the feas@xmath18 tetrahedron is transformed into a regular one @xcite .",
    "another family of feas - based superconductors without oxygens has been reported in the ternary compound ba@xmath14k@xmath22fe@xmath23as@xmath23 with @xmath24 38 k @xcite . in this compound ,",
    "layers consisting of edge - sharing feas@xmath18 tetrahedra are separated by ba(k ) layers .",
    "moreover , sc was also reported in @xmath25-fese with @xmath24 8 k @xcite .",
    "this compound is composed of stacking layers of fese , resembling the feas layers in lafeaso@xmath14f@xmath22 , but containing neither any ba(k ) atoms nor lao sheets .",
    "the present experimental facts suggest that systematic studies of the local electronic state at the fe site are quite important to elucidate the origin of sc in the iron - based compounds .    in this paper , we report @xmath5fe - nmr and @xmath6as - nqr / nmr studies of the superconducting and normal - state properties of fe - based pnictide high-@xmath11 superconductors .",
    "we review the previous results on refeaso@xmath0 published elsewhere @xcite , and present the recent results on ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of lafeaso@xmath0 , prfeaso@xmath1 , ndfeaso@xmath1 , and ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 were synthesized via the high - pressure synthesis technique described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although the real oxygen content of the samples may be greater than the nominal ( intended ) values due to the oxidation of the starting re elements , powder x - ray diffraction measurements indicate that these samples are almost entirely composed of a single phase .",
    "the @xmath11s for all samples were determined by susceptibility measurement , which indicated a marked decrease due to the onset of sc below @xmath24 20 k , 28 k , 28 k , 22 k , 46 k , and 53 k for lafeaso@xmath26 , @xmath5fe - enriched lafeaso@xmath7 , lafeaso@xmath1 , lafeaso@xmath27 , prfeaso@xmath1 , and ndfeaso@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "note that the lattice parameters @xmath28 = 4.0226 and @xmath29 = 8.7065 of @xmath5fe - enriched lafeaso@xmath7 are very close to those of lafeaso@xmath1 ( @xmath28 = 4.0220 and @xmath29 = 8.7110 ) , indicating that the physical properties of both samples are compatible .",
    "@xmath11 of lafeaso@xmath27 is lower than that of lafeaso@xmath1 because the former is in an overdoped regime .",
    "this result is corroborated by the fact that the lattice parameters of lafeaso@xmath27 are smaller than those of lafeaso@xmath1 ( @xmath24 28 k ) .",
    "the samples were moderately crushed into powder for the nqr / nmr measurements .",
    "@xmath5fe - nmr and @xmath6as - nqr / nmr measurements were performed by using the phase coherent pulsed nmr / nqr spectrometer in the temperature ( @xmath30 ) range between 4 k and 280 k. @xmath31 was measured using the saturation recovery method .",
    "figure [ spectrum](a ) shows the @xmath5fe - nmr spectra for lafeaso@xmath7 obtained by a sweeping frequency ( @xmath32 ) at a magnetic field @xmath33 11.97 t at 30 k. for @xmath34 parallel to the @xmath35-plane , a single nmr spectrum is observed with a very narrow linewidth with @xmath3620 khz .",
    "this result indicates that the feas layers of this sample are rather homogeneous irrespective of the oxygen deficiency in the lao layer . for @xmath34",

    "a transferred hyperfine - coupling constant at the as site @xmath53 consists of two contributions in the isotropic term of a transferred hyperfine field ( @xmath54 ) and the anisotropic one of a pseudo - dipole field ( @xmath55 ) @xcite , both of which are induced by neighboring fe-@xmath56 spin polarization . from a plot of @xmath57 versus @xmath58 with @xmath30 as an implicit parameter , @xmath59",

    "this result suggests the possible existence of an isotropic gap in a very - low - temperature regime , providing firm evidence of spin - singlet cooper pairing through the direct measurement of the local spin susceptibility by means of the @xmath5fe - knight shift .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath63 at the @xmath5fe site was determined from a single exponential recovery curve of @xmath5fe nuclear magnetization as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective nuclear magnetizations for the thermal equilibrium condition and at time @xmath67 after the saturation pulse .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . [ ferecovery ] , @xmath68 was uniquely determined from a single exponential function of @xmath69 in the entire @xmath30 range , revealing that the electronic state of the present sample is homogeneous .",

    "considering that @xmath5fe - nmr @xmath31 measured in the sc mixed state under @xmath33 6.309 t exhibits a @xmath30 dependence similar to that of @xmath6as - nqr @xmath82 , it would be expected that the presence of vortex cores would not affect the quasiparticle excitations in the sc state considerably .",
    "this implies that the @xmath31 measurements can clarify the sc gap structure although it has been measured under @xmath34 .",

    "in fact , the results of @xmath99s for @xmath5fe and @xmath6as in the sc state are consistent with the latter model .",
