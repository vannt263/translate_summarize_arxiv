    "in order to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters there is a lot of future experimental projects which would have ability of precision measurement .",
    "it means that we may have sensitivity to not only the standard oscillation parameters but also some new physics effect on neutrino sector . in this talk",
    ", we discuss about probing the non - standard neutrino physics with future long baseline experiment based on the works@xcite@xcite .    due to limitations of space",
    ", we would like to concentrate mainly on the work of non - standard neutrino interaction with neutrino factory .",
    "since early time , it is suggested the possible existence of non - standard interaction(nsi ) of neutrinos with matter@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss about probing such a nsi with future long baseline experiments .    introducing the lagrangian for nsi : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi constant , @xmath3 for the species of fermions in the earth e , u , d , and @xmath4 . in this notation , @xmath5 is the effective coupling normalized by week interaction .",
    "concentrating on the effect of nsi in neutrino propagation , the evolution equation is written as ,    @xmath6 ~          \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }                      \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu \\\\",
    "\\nu_\\tau           \\end{array }   \\right ) \\label{nsi - evolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where u is the maki - nakagawa - sakata flavor mixing matrix@xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the electron number density in the earth , and @xmath9 describes the total effect of nsi coming from charged fermion e , u , d. though off - diagonal @xmath10 parameters may have complex phase , we assume in this talk that all @xmath9 s are real .    in order to improve the sensitivity to nsi , we examine the power of golden channel at neutrino factory@xcite .",
    "neutrino factory has a great sensitivity to @xmath11 . considering that @xmath9 produces non - standard flavor changing effect",
    ", it is natural to expect that we have a high sensitivity also to nsi parameters .",
    "in fact , the contribution to oscillation probability @xmath12 of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are same order to the one of @xmath15 .",
    "though this feature helps us to probe the nsi , but at the same time possible existence of nsi may destroy the precision measurement of @xmath0 and cp - phase @xmath16 , the so called confusion problem @xcite@xcite .    see the upper panels of figure [ fig_th13del_const ] .",
    "this is the allowed region of standard oscillation parameters @xmath11 and @xmath16 on neutrino factory with a detector at 3000 km obtained by marginalizing certain combinations of two @xmath9 s .",
    "as noted above , the sensitivity to the standard oscillation parameters become significantly worse . in particular",
    "we can not determine the nonzero value of @xmath0 even at the input value of @xmath17 for the case with @xmath18 .     and cp - phase @xmath16 with use of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 channel for various combination of nsi elements @xmath9 .",
    "the upper(middle ) panels are for a detector at 3000(7000)km , and the bottom panels for the combined one .",
    "the input values of @xmath9 are zero , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the figure complements those in @xcite with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . ]    in order to solve this confusion problem , we consider the 2nd detector at 7000 km .",
    "this is nearby so called magic baseline@xcite@xcite , where @xmath25 km for constant earth matter density @xmath26g / cc .",
    "the magic baseline is the special distance because @xmath12 is independent of the solar oscillation parameters and @xmath16 . at the magic baseline ,",
    "oscillation probability with @xmath14 is written as@xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . with the information of complex phase @xmath16 at 3000 km , we can determine a certain combination of @xmath0 and @xmath14 at the magic baseline .",
    "this advantage helps us solve the confusion problem .",
    "bottom panels in figure [ fig_th13del_const ] are the allowed region of @xmath31 and @xmath16 with the combined information of two detectors .",
    "the sensitivity becomes dramatically higher .",
    "the synergy effect is also powerful for probing the nsi .",
    "figure [ fig_eps_const ] presented the allowed region of the nsi parameters .",
    "though it is very hard to determine the @xmath32 with a individual detector , we can determine the nsi parameters very accurately if we combine the two .    .",
    "]    in this work@xcite , the sensitivity reach for @xmath9 we have obtained is : @xmath33 in more recent work with information of @xmath34 disappearance channel@xcite , the sensitivity reach to nsi parameters in @xmath35 sector is reported as @xmath36 they confirmed that the two detector setting at @xmath37 km and @xmath38 km , which is similar to ours , is close to optimal even if nsi in matter are considerd .",
    "notice that it is nothing but the standard ids - nf setup@xcite@xcite .",
    "finally we would like to point out that even though the true value of @xmath0 vanishes or extremely small , in which case we can not measure the cp - phase @xmath16 neither , we would have a reasonable sensitivity to non - standard neutrino interaction .",
    "it is because the contribution of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath12 remains as @xmath39 and @xmath40 terms in the perturbative formula .",
    "in the relatively near future experiment , we have the sensitivity to nsi on the @xmath41 sector @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we briefly mention hare the potential of t2kk@xcite for searching the nsi using @xmath34 disappearance channel@xcite .    for small @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath34 disappearance channel can be written by two flavor approximation . in such system , the effects of nsi to oscillation probability are large with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and , @xmath46 .",
    "so concentrating these @xmath10 s , the sensitivity at 2 @xmath47 cl .",
    "may be reached by t2kk setup : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath45 is assumed zero because only the difference can be measured .",
    "we discussed the power of the two detector setting at different baseline distance for probing non - standard neutrino physics .",
    "neutrino factory , especially with two detectors at 3000 and 7000 km , is a powerful setting for solving the confusion problem that make the precision measurement of standard oscillation parameters untenable if we consider the possible existence of nsi .",
    "it is also useful to search the nsi even for extremely small value of nsi parameters .",
