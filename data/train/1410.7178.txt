    "an electron incident on a superconductor from a normal metal , with an energy smaller than the superconducting energy gap , can not propagate into the superconductor and thus should be perfectly reflected .",
    "however , andreev discovered a mechanism for transmission , in which an electron may form a cooper pair with another electron and be transmitted across the superconductor .",
    "as a consequence of charge conservation a hole must be left behind , which , as a result of momentum conservation , should propagate in a direction opposite to that of the incident electron .",
    "this process is termed andreev reflection  @xcite .    apart",
    "from providing a confirmation for the existence of cooper pairs and superconductor energy gaps  @xcite , this process may also have applications in spintronics .",
    "it has been suggested that point contact andreev reflection can be used to probe spin polarization of ferromagnets by fabricating ferromagnet - superconductor nanojunctions  @xcite .",
    "materials - specific modelling of such experiments , however , is complex and so far it has been somehow unsatisfactory . for instance",
    "tight - binding based scattering theory  @xcite and green s functions theory  @xcite calculations found poor fits to the experimental data for ferromagnet - superconductor junctions , while produced excellent fitting to normal metal - superconductor junctions results . based on this observation",
    ", xia and co - workers suggested that there may be an interaction between the ferromagnet and superconductor which is not accounted for in the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the simple interpretation and two - parameter btk model fitting of experimental data to extract the spin polarization of various ferromagnets , was also called into question .",
    "more recently , chen , tesanovic and chien proposed a unified model for andreev reflection at a ferromagnet - superconductor interface  @xcite .",
    "this is based on a partially polarized current , where the andreev reflection is limited by minority states and the excess majority carriers provide an evanescent contribution .",
    "however , this model has also been called into doubt by eschrig and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they pointed out that the additional evanescent component is introduced in an _ ad - hoc _ manner , and that the resulting wavefunction violates charge conservation .",
    "so , the debate about the correct model to describe andreev reflection at a ferromagnet - superconductor junction seems far from being settled .    among other mesoscopic systems ,",
    "andreev reflection has also been measured in carbon nanotubes ( cnts )  @xcite .",
    "there has been a theoretical study of normal metal - molecule - superconductor junction from density functional theory based transport calculations  @xcite . in this study",
    "it was shown that the presence of side groups in the molecule can lead to fano resonances in andreev reflection spectra .",
    "topological insulators , a very recent and exciting development in condensed matter physics , have also been shown to be characterized by perfect andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "wang and co - authors have recently suggested performing a self - consistent calculation of the scattering potential to study andreev reflection at normal metal - superconductor junctions  @xcite .",
    "they calculated the conductance for carbon chains sandwiched between a normal and a superconducting al electrode and found different values depending on whether or not the calculation was carried out self - consistent over the hartree and exchange - correlation potential .",
    "however , the theoretical justification for such a self - consistent procedure is at present not clear .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to argue that the variational principle , which underpins the hohenberg - kohn theorems , is still obeyed when a pairing energy is added _ by hand _ to the kohn - sham potential . in principle a rigorous self - consistent treatment should use the superconducting version of density functional theory  @xcite , which probably remains computationally too expensive for calculating the interfaces needed to address a scattering problem",
    ". given such theoretical landscape and the fact that a non self - consistent approach to density functional theory based transport calculations has shown excellent agreement to experimental results for normal metal - superconductor junctions , we follow this methodology in the present work .    in this paper",
    ", we study andreev reflection in normal - superconductor junctions , including all - metal junctions and carbon nanotubes sandwiched between normal and superconducting electrodes .",
    "we take into account the atomistic details of the junction by using density functional theory to obtain the underlying electronic structure , and then employ an extended btk model to solve the normal - superconductor scattering problem .",
    "our transverse momentum resolved calculations allow identifying the contributions to conductance from different parts of the brillouin zone .",
    "we also study the variation of conductance as a function of an applied potential difference between the electrodes for various normal metal - superconductor junctions , by performing approximate finite bias calculations .    after this introduction",
    ", the rest of our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ formulation ] we summarize the extended btk model and beenakker s formula , which we employ in this work . in the subsequent section  [ results ] ,",
    "we present our results for cu - pb , co - pb and au - al junctions , as well as al - cnt - al junctions .",
    "we also include the computational details in each of these subsections .",
    "finally , we conclude and summarize our findings in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "for the sake of completeness , here we briefly summarize the extended btk model  @xcite that we use to study andreev reflection at a normal metal - superconductor interface . following refs .",
    "[ ] , we begin with the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the single particle hamiltonian for majority ( @xmath2 ) and minority ( @xmath3 ) spins , @xmath4 is the pairing potential and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "the energy @xmath7 sets the reference to the fermi energy , @xmath8 .",
    "we follow the approach of beenakker consisting in inserting a layer of superconductor in its normal state between the metal - superconductor interface .",
    "this ensures that at the fictitious normal metal - superconductor interface the only scattering process is andreev scattering .    , indicated by the arrow .",
    "self - energies are used to simulate the effect of semi - infinite leads attached to the edge of the scattering region . ]",
    "other scattering processes are accounted for at the junction between the normal metal the and superconductor in its normal state . at this interface",
    "the scattering matrix can be written as @xmath9 here the superscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the right- and left - going states and the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the normal and fictitious normal metal regions , respectively .",
    "the normal state scattering matrix reads @xmath14    now at the fictitious normal metal - superconductor interface @xmath15 where the factor @xmath16 is @xmath17 , \\quad |\\varepsilon|<\\delta \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\delta}[\\varepsilon-\\mathrm{sign}(\\varepsilon)\\sqrt{\\varepsilon^{2}-\\delta^{2 } } ] , \\quad |\\varepsilon|>\\delta\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the states in the normal metal are given by @xmath18    then the reflection coefficients for the complete system are @xmath19 and @xmath20    finally the conductance of the system is given by @xmath21 the implicit assumptions in the above derivation are that the superconducting order parameter is switched on abruptly as a step function ( i.e. , there are no proximity effects ) and the order parameter is much smaller than the fermi energy ( the so - called andreev approximation ) .",
    "a great simplification occurs if one considers scattering at fermi energy , namely @xmath22 , and the presence of time reversal symmetry , i.e. , the normal metal is not a ferromagnet .",
    "the above expression for conductance reduces to @xmath23 where the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix product @xmath24 are @xmath25 .",
    "this is the beenakker s formula  @xcite .",
    "notice that all the dependence on the superconductor pairing has dropped out and the conductance depends on the normal state transmission eigenvalues . in this case superconductivity enters implicitly in the form of a boundary condition . in our first - principles transport code smeagol",
    "@xcite , we construct the full scattering matrix and then use the expressions in equations  ( [ ree ] ) and  ( [ rhe ] ) to evaluate the conductance from equation  ( [ gnsfull ] ) .",
    "for the special case of @xmath26 , we construct the transmission matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain its eigenvalues by numerical diagonalization .",
    "these are then interted into the beenakker s formula [ equation  ( [ gnsbeenakker ] ) ] to obtain @xmath27 , while a direct summation of the eigenvalues yields @xmath28 .",

    "was employed for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we choose an energy cutoff of 400 rydberg for the real space mesh , and a double-@xmath40 polarized basis set .",
    "the lattice constants of cu ( @xmath41 ) and pb ( @xmath42 ) are quite different , however a matching is obtained by rotating cu unit cell by a @xmath43 angle . in this geometry a small strain ( @xmath44% ) exists on both cu ( compressive ) and pb ( tensile ) . for the self - consistent calculation we use a @xmath45 in plane monkhorst - pack grid , while transport quantities are evaluated over a much denser @xmath46 @xmath47 grid .    , between cu and pb .",

    "the scattering region for a cu - pb junction is shown in fig .",
    "[ cu - pb - setup ] .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the plane orthogonal to the transport direction , and open boundary conditions along the direction of transport .",
    "we plot the available channels for both electrodes resolved over the brillouin zone ( bz ) at the fermi energy in fig .",
    "[ cu - pb - kp](a ) . for the left electrode ( cu )",
    "four channels are available in quadrants centered at the edge of the bz , with a residual region around the zone center in which either three or two channels are available . for the right electrode ( pb ) around the bz center",
    "there exists a rectangular region with three open channels , while at the bz corners there are small pockets of reduced available channels , which even drop down to zero .",
    "the normal conductance , @xmath34 , is large over almost the entire bz , along with small pockets of lower transmission at the edges of the bz , which are inherited from the reduced channel pockets in the pb electrode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cu - pb - kp](b ) . another small conductance pocket is present at the zone center , which originates from the distribution of open channels across the bz in the cu electrode .",
    "the overall conductance remains largely unchanged as the cu - pb distance is increased from @xmath50  1.5 to 3.0  .",
    "next we show the normal metal - superconductor junction conductance , @xmath27 , in fig .",
    "[ cu - pb - kp](c ) . at @xmath50 1.5  ,",
    "the pockets of small conductance at the zone edges are more prominent , as compared to @xmath34 . moreover , the region around @xmath51 , with reduced conductance is also larger . on increasing the distance to 2  ,",
    "these low conductance pockets shrink in size and the overall conductance increases . at larger distances , a broader region of low conductance develops and this reduces overall @xmath27 . in table",
    "[ cu - pb - tab ] , we provide the @xmath47-averaged value of the conductance above ( @xmath34 ) and below ( @xmath27 ) the pb superconducting temperature . for both quantities a maximum is obtained at @xmath50 2  .",
    "we also tabulate the ratio @xmath52 , which is the quantity expressing the zero - bias suppression due to andreev reflection . for a single channel btk model describing an ideal interface",
    "this ratio is exactly two , however when one takes into account the band structure mismatch and the underlying electronic structure of the electrodes a much lower value for this ratio can be obtained . for the cu - pb equilibrium distance ( @xmath53  )",
    "we find @xmath52 close to 1.4 , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 1.38 reported in ref .  .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we study the variation of normalized conductance as a function of an applied bias , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ al - cnt - bias ] . at low bias , for al - cnt(3,0)-al junction",
    "the normal metal - superconductor conductance is greater than the normal conductance .",
    "interestingly , the situation is reversed at a voltage of 0.1  mv .",
    "in contrast , for al - cnt(4,0)-al junction , the normalized conductance remains negative for voltages less than the superconducting gap .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied andreev reflection in normal - superconductor junctions using density functional theory based transport calculations .",
    "this approach allowed us to include the atomistic details of the junction electronic structure in the extended blonder - tinkham - klapwijk model .",
    "we studied au - al and cu - pb all metal junctions and calculated the normal and normal - superconductor conductances for different separations of the two materials at the interface .",
    "our transverse momentum resolved analysis has allowed us to identify contributions to these quantities from different parts of the brillouin zone .",
    "we found that the conductances for junctions in the superconducting state follows a similar @xmath47-point dependence as the normal state conductance .",
    "in other words , andreev reflection is higher in brillouin zone regions , where transmission is also high .",
    "we have also investigated co - pb ferromagnet - superconductor junctions . in this case , while at zero bias , our results satisfactorily match the experimental reports , a discrepancy was revealed at a finite bias , particularly at voltages close to the superconductor gap .",
    "this could possibly be attributed to stray magnetic fields from the ferromagnet or to proximity effects , both causes which are not included in the extended blonder - tinkham - klapwijk model .",
    "we further studied andreev reflection from carbon nanotubes sandwiched between normal metal and superconducting electrodes and found @xmath52 ratios to lie on opposite sides of unity for @xmath54 ( higher than one ) and @xmath55 ( lesser than one ) carbon nanotubes .",
    "this highlights the sensitivity of such calculations to details and the need for a truly atomistic theory for tackling this problem .",
    "concerning the potential outlook for future studies , our work provides a stepping stone for analyzing with first - principles methods the experimental setups needed to investigate and detect majorana fermions .",
    "these particles , which are their own anti - particles , are expected to play a crucial role in topological quantum computing and have recently garnered significant attention in the condensed matter community .",
    "after several theoretical proposals , signatures of this particle were found experimentally in large spin - orbit nanowires in proximity with superconductors  @xcite . however , a number of issues remain unresolved and important questions need to be answered to confirm that indeed majoranas were observed",
    ". our implementation of the phenomenology of andreev reflection in a first - principles approach can be quite useful to study such a setup , in particular , by taking into account the underlying electronic structure of the nanowires . when combined with the order-@xmath56 implementation of our smeagol code  @xcite , which allows us treating thousands of atoms",
