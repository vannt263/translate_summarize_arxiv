    "the absorption - line systems found in quasar / gamma - ray burst spectra , the so - called `` quasar absorption systems '' , provide us with a unique probe of galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "the systems offer valuable opportunities to explore the physical and chemical properties of inter - galactic media and/or intervening galaxies ( e.g. , the amount of neutral gas and metals , the gas dynamics ) .",
    "in particular , because the absorption feature provides basic information about hydrogen gas which is a main component of galactic gas , hi absorption systems have been studied extensively as means of placing stringent constraints on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "recently , radio surveys have provided large samples of hi - selected galaxies and significantly improved our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "the hi - selected galaxies have been explored in blind surveys of the hi emissions , for example , the slice survey ( ss ; e.g. , spitzak & schneider 1998 ) , the arecibo dual - beam survey(adbs ; e.g. , rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) , the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; e.g. , zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ; meyer et al . 2004 ) , the hideep survey ( hideep ; e.g. , minchin et al .",
    "2003 ) , the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ; walter et al . 2008 ) , and the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; e.g. , giovanelli et al .",
    "these surveys result in an accurate measurement of the basic properties of galactic hi - gas ( e.g. , the hi mass function , himf ) .",
    "when the hi - selected galaxies exist on a line of sight to quasar / gamma - ray burst , the hi - selected galaxies can be hi - absorption systems due to having the hi column densities as high as those of hi absorption systems . in this paper , using a model of galaxy formation , we aim to reveal the basic properties of hi absorption systems by focusing on hi - selected galaxies in blind radio surveys .    among the hi absorption systems , damped lyman @xmath0 absorption ( dla ) systems have been studied because the high hi column densities ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) are considered to be a good probe of an early stage of star formation processes .",
    "the origin of dla systems has been argued on the basis of the observational properties .",
    "it has been considered as , for example , rapidly rotating gaseous disks of massive spiral galaxies ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "1986 ) , and so on .",
    "theoretical studies , utilizing numerical simulations and semi - analytic models , have been tackled to revealing the nature of dla systems and a relationship to galaxy population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "although the studies reproduce many properties of dla systems , definite conclusion has not been reached yet .",
    "for example , at high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) , dla systems have high number densities per unit redshift ( the incidence rate ) @xmath17 and large velocity widths @xmath18 of the absorption lines . using models under an assumption that dla systems arise mainly in galactic disks of virialized halos ,",
    "the high number densities require large number of less massive galaxies . however , the predicted velocity widths @xmath18 of absorption lines produced by less massive systems appear to be smaller than the typical values of observed ones @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the high number densities are also attributed to large cross sections of the other population , for example , extended gas that resides within / outside virial radii of halos , outflow gas due to supernova explosions , tidal gas related to galaxy interactions , and so on . at high redshifts , the mixed population , in addition to compact disks , may give rise to damped lyman @xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "there are the dedicated attempts to detect the host galaxies of dla systems by optically deep - imaging observations ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1994 , 1997 ; le brun et al . 1997 ; rao & turnshek 1998 , 2000 ; turnshek et al .",

    ". a few cases of successful identifications suggest that the host galaxies of dla systems present mixed morphological types of galaxies .",
    "however , in many cases , it is a challenging task to identify the host galaxies in the emission of the optical surveys , because many host galaxies are very faint and/or very compact .    at low redshifts ( @xmath21 )",
    ", it is expected that more dla hosts can be identified even in the case when their luminosities are low . in the observation , for example , @xcite have compiled data for host galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , their sample size is still small ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "they argued that the sample is dominated by galaxies with low - luminosities and small impact parameters .",
    "@xcite have theoretically investigated galaxies having hi column densities as high as those of dla systems ( hereafter , dla galaxies ) at low redshifts using a semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "we concluded that dla galaxies consist primarily of low luminosity galaxies with small sizes ( typical radius @xmath23 @xmath24kpc , surface brightness in the @xmath3-band @xmath25 to @xmath26 mag arcsec@xmath27 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the observations that , at low redshifts , dla systems arise primarily in galactic disks rather than tidal gas caused by galaxy interactions or gas driven by galactic winds .",
    "moreover , in our conclusion , ( 1 ) dla galaxies have typical star formation rates ( sfrs ) @xmath28 @xmath29 yr@xmath30 and ( 2 ) that the difficulty in identifying dla galaxies is due not only to their faintness but also to a _ masking effect _ which occurs when the point spread function ( psf ) of the respective background quasars masks the dla galaxies .",
    "we suggest that @xmath31 of dla galaxies suffer from this masking effect .",
    "thus , dla galaxies in the local universe significantly should consist of the optically - faint and compact systems that require another approach to host galaxy detection in observations .    to understand dla systems , it is useful to investigate hi - selected galaxies detected in radio surveys because they contain a large amount of neutral gas that potentially gives rise to strong absorption lines when bright emission sources exist behind them .",
    "the adbs , hipass , and things provide significantly large samples for dla galaxies compared to those of the optical counterparts of dla systems identified in the optical and near - infrared images at @xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the large radio samples show interesting properties ( e.g. , hi cross - section and hi mass ) of dla galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the study of radio samples can offer _ statistically _ valuable information about dla galaxies and opportunities for exploring the evolution of dla systems .",
    "the advantage of using the radio samples is summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the radio survey has no bias against optically low surface brightness galaxies that may be missed by optical and near - infrared surveys , ( 2 ) the identification process is free from the masking effect because no bright sources are located behind them , and ( 3 ) the sample size is much larger than those of dla optical counterparts .    by employing our model for dla galaxies ,",
    "we investigate the number of hi - selected galaxies that can be dla galaxies .",
    "next , we focus on the optical properties ( e.g. , sfr ) of dla galaxies to explore how dla galaxies should be detected in optical surveys .",
    "finally , we investigate the number of hi - selected galaxies that can be host galaxies of other quasar absorption systems such as sub - dla systems that exhibit hi column densities lower than those of dla systems .",
    "this study of hi - selected galaxies offers valuable opportunities for exploring the low - redshift end of the evolution of dla and sub - dla systems .",

    "we focus on another population of absorption systems , namely sub - dla systems , and argue how they contribute to the local galaxy population . in section 6 , we derive several implications from our results .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusion in section 7 .",
    "we employ a semi analytic model of galaxy formation for dla galaxies ( * ? ? ?",

    "it has been shown that this model accounts for the observational properties of local galaxies , such as luminosity functions and cold gas mass fractions @xcite .",

    "the outline of this model is described as follows .",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath35cdm cosmological model with parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 km s@xmath30 is the hubble parameter ) , and @xmath41 , the normalization of the power spectrum of density fluctuations given by @xcite .",
    "the number of progenitors of a dark halo is given by an extended press - schechter model .",
    "the mass function at @xmath34 is provided by the press - schechter mass function @xcite .",
    "the realizations of progenitor histories are computed by the method developed by @xcite .",
    "we focus on halos with circular velocity @xmath42 km s@xmath30 because we assume that less massive systems ( @xmath43 km s@xmath30 ) correspond to diffuse accretion masses .",
    "the main difference from the previous model is a value adopted for the threshold on the accretion mass , @xmath44 ; @xmath44 @xmath45 km s@xmath30 in papers i and ii .",
    "we assume that baryonic gas comprises cold and hot phases .",
    "when a halo collapses , halo gas is assumed to be shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo and distributed in a singular isothermal sphere ( _ hot gas _ ) .",
    "the gas component partly cools by radiative cooling processes .",
    "the cooled gas is called ` _ cold gas _ ' . here",
    "we use a metallicity - dependent cooling function ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "after the cold gas falls onto a central region of the halo , stars are formed from the cold gas .",
    "the sfr is assumed to be @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the masses of stars and cold gas , respectively , and @xmath49 is the timescale of star formation .",
    "we simply assume that the sfrs are constant in the galactic disks .",
    "following our previous models , we assume the timescale of star formation ; @xmath50 .",
    "in papers i and ii , we found that , to account for several observational properties of the dla hosts , @xmath49 should be constant with redshift and dependent on the circular velocity @xmath51 of the halos hosting dlas , i.e. , ( @xmath52 , @xmath53)=(@xmath54 , @xmath55 km s@xmath30 ) .",
    "here we determine the parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) by matching the hi mass function to those that have been observed .",
    "initially , we adopt a set of parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53)=(@xmath54 , @xmath55 km s@xmath30 ) and @xmath56 gyr , the same set as used for the previous model ( constant star formation model ) in papers i and ii .    moreover , we also consider another model for star formation , adopting a different set of parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "assuming that the star formation timescale @xmath57 , adopting small ( large negative ) values of @xmath52 indicates that the star formation timescales are longer in less massive galaxies .",
    "this leads less massive galaxies to have lower sfrs and then produces high number densities of low @xmath2 galaxies . here",
    "we employ a model in which the star formation rates are low in less massive systems by adopting @xmath58 .",
    "hereafter , we call the two models : high star formation ( hs ) model with @xmath59 and low star formation ( ls ) model with @xmath58 .",
    "the normalizations of the star formation timescale , ( @xmath60 , @xmath53)=(@xmath61 gyr , @xmath55 km s@xmath30 ) , are identical for both models .",
    "supernova feedback processes are incorporated in this model .",
    "the rate of reheating by supernova feedback is assumed to be @xmath62 . because the feedback process should affect the physical condition of the gas more drastically in less massive galaxies , we assume that @xmath63 , where the parameter sets , ( @xmath64 , @xmath65)=(@xmath66 km s@xmath30 , @xmath67 ) km s@xmath30 slightly smaller than @xmath68 km s@xmath30 adopted in papers i and ii because this better matches the observational data of hi mass functions as presented below .",
    "we have confirmed that this makes little difference to our previous results in papers i and ii . ] for the hs model and ( @xmath69 km s@xmath30 , @xmath67 ) for the ls model , are required to account for the observed optical luminosity functions of local galaxies .",
    "the results for optical luminosity functions are argued in section 3 .",
    "we include the merging of galaxies in this model . in our model ,",
    "when two or more dark halos merge , the central galaxy in the largest progenitor halo becomes the new central one .",
    "the other galaxies become satellites dwelling in the largest halo of the central galaxy .",
    "we assume that the merging of _ galaxies _ in a common halo occurs due to two types of mechanisms : dynamical friction and random collision .",
    "when satellite galaxies merge with the central one , the merging occurs on the dynamical friction timescale . in the merging of satellites ,",
    "they collide randomly within the mean - free timescale . after the merging of two galaxies ( e.g. , a and b )",
    ", a starburst occurs and all cold gas is consumed by the star formation if the mass ratio , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , is larger than @xmath72 ( _ major merger _ ) .",
    "otherwise , no star formation activity occurs when the mass ratio is smaller than @xmath72 ( _ minor merger _ ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath73 in the same way as in papers i and ii .",
    "we address the definition of the size and the hi column density of a dla galaxy . in this model ,",
    "the radial distribution of the hi column density follows an exponential profile with an effective radius of a gaseous disk , @xmath74 , obtained by assuming the specific angular momentum conservation of the cooling hot gas .",
    "the dimensionless spin parameter of dark halos has a log - normal distribution with an average of @xmath75 and a logarithmic variance of @xmath76 . using the above assumptions , we calculate the following quantities .",
    "the first is the central column density provided by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath79 is the mean molecular weight . in this procedure , in order to take into account the inclination , @xmath80 of gaseous disks in each galaxy , we create random realizations of the inclinations , and then calculate the cross section and the column density .",
    "the second is the size of a dla galaxy defined by a radius @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath15 .",
    "here we adopt the conventional threshold for the hi column density of dla systems .",
    "the third is the hi column density of a dla galaxy , which is defined as the column density averaged over radius within @xmath81 .",
    "first , we present the optical luminosity function and the hi mass function ( himf ) of local galaxies provided by the optical and the radio surveys .",
    "these properties are strong indicators used to probe the physical conditions of nearby galaxies with statistically significant confidence because , for the optical luminosity function , the sample size of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is quite large , more than 30,000 ( blanton et al . 2005 ) , and , for the himf , the sample size from the hipass is about @xmath83 ( zwaan et al .",

    "it appears that the abundance of bright galaxies ( @xmath85 ) is slightly higher than the observation .",
    "this is partly because , for simplicity , we adopt total magnitudes instead of the petrosian magnitudes that the sdss team uses .",
    "this makes simulated galaxies more luminous than the observed ones .    in figure 1(b ) , we show the @xmath84-band luminosity function of galaxies ( solid  line ) for the ls model .",
    "the ls model reproduces the faint - end slope of the luminosity function .",
    "however , the abundance of bright galaxies , particularly at @xmath86 , is slightly lower than that for the hs model that reproduces the observation . for the ls model , by adopting @xmath87 km s@xmath30 instead of @xmath66 km s@xmath30 used for the hs model , the reheating rate by supernova feedback is higher than that for the hs model .",

    "the shapes of luminosity functions of dla galaxies are similar to those of galaxies in the whole range of the observed magnitudes , indicating that many ( bright and faint ) galaxies have gaseous disks with hi column densities large enough to give rise to damped ly@xmath0 absorption lines when they are on a line of sight to the background quasar . in other words ,",
    "the low - redshift dla systems arise not only in bright @xmath89 galaxies but also in faint ones .",
    "the hi mass function ( himf ) is one of the most important statistical properties of local galaxies .",
    "while the optical luminosity function describes the distribution of stellar mass , the himf describes the distribution of cold gas mass .",

    ".    figure 2(a ) shows the himf of galaxies for the hs model ( solid line ) .",
    "the predicted himf is similar to a schechter - type function .",
    "blind 21 cm surveys have shown that hi - selected galaxies follow an himf , @xmath90 , that can be well fitted by a schechter function with a faint - end slope @xmath0 , @xmath91 , e.g. , for the hipass sample , @xmath92 in the mass range @xmath93 @xcite . however , because the survey fields and/or the sample sizes are different , the slopes of himfs still appear to differ from survey to survey ( e.g. , @xmath94 to @xmath95 ) .",
    "this may be due to environmental effects in which the slope depends on the local galaxy density . taking into account this uncertainty , we present the range of himfs provided by various blind surveys ( the shaded region ; henning et al .",

    "however , in the low - mass end , the predicted abundance is somewhat lower than the hipass observations . although the small observational sample at @xmath97 accounts for some uncertainties in the low - mass end , for the hs model , the underprediction is mainly due to the high star formation rates suppressing the formation of low @xmath2 galaxies .    in figure 2(b ) , we show the himf for the ls model ( solid  line ) .",
    "the ls model also produces a good match to the observations . in comparison to the data range of number densities",

    "the circular velocity threshold @xmath247 , which gives the lowest circular velocity for galactic halos , sensitively depends on the intensity of uv radiation and the reionization process .",
    "thus , the threshold @xmath44 should affect the number of less massive galaxies and the shape of himfs .",
    "for example , somerville ( 2002 ) investigated the effect of suppressing the formation of less massive galaxies due to the squelching of gas infall by the ionizing background radiation in order to resolve the excess number of dwarf galaxies predicted by a semi - analytic model .",
    "they find that halos with @xmath248 km s@xmath30 are not able to accrete gas .",
    "this suggests that photoionization squelching suppresses formation of less massive galaxies in halos with @xmath248 km s@xmath30 .",
    "however , okamoto et al . ( 2008 ) argued that , in somerville ( 2002 ) , the fitting function , concerning accreted gas in a halo , overestimates the mass of the halo within which gas can cool . on the basis of the result obtained by the numerical simulation , the authors require the threshold @xmath44 to be less than @xmath249 km s@xmath30 .",
    "for the hs model in our calculation , adopting a small threshold of @xmath44 @xmath250 km s@xmath30 may produce an increase of less massive galaxies and give better agreement with the observed abundance at the low - mass end of himfs .",
    "the underestimate of himfs at low - mass end might also be caused by the shape of the adopted halo mass function used here . in this calculation , we adopt a mass function of dark halo progenitors given by an extended press  schechter formalism .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations show some discrepancies between the mass function of dark halos and those given by the extended press - schechter formalism , in particular for those at the low mass end ( e.g. , somerville et al .",
    "2000 ; yahagi , nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; li et al . 2007 ) .",
    "although no definite conclusion has yet been reached regarding which mass functions should be adopted here , this may cause an underestimation of the number densities of less massive galaxies at @xmath251 .",
    "it should be noted that there are uncertainties in the determination of the himf slope from observations .",
    "the low - mass end of the himf suffers from statistical uncertainties due to the small sample size .",
    "for example , the adbs sample includes only a dozen galaxies and the hipass does @xmath252 galaxies with @xmath97 . additionally , there are also uncertainties in the distance estimation @xcite",
    ". however , the himf slope should place stringent constraints on the formation of dwarf galaxies as well as the optical luminosity function .",
    "this is a clear point that deserves further investigation .",
    "it is also valuable to note the total hi mass density parameter , that is the hi mass density of galaxies as a fraction of the cosmic critical density .",
    "we find @xmath253 @xmath254 @xmath133 for the hs model and @xmath255 @xmath254 @xmath256 for the ls model . in comparison to the observations , we find that the hi mass density parameter for the hs model is consistent with the hipass measurement @xmath257 @xmath254 @xmath133 @xcite .      here",
    "we address the number density per unit redshift @xmath17 .",
    "our results present @xmath17 of dla galaxies",
    "@xmath258 at @xmath34 for the hs model and @xmath259 for the ls model .",
    "the ls model produces larger @xmath17 than the hs model because , for the ls model the low sfrs in dla galaxies cause high hi column densities above the dla threshold . in observations , the adbs sample for dla galaxies at @xmath34 yields @xmath260 @xcite , the hipass @xmath261 @xcite and @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "these are consistent with our results .",
    "because our models reproduce the @xmath17 and cross sections , our result suggests that , even in the case that less - massive dla galaxies ( @xmath263 ) are taken into account , dla systems at @xmath34 arise primarily in galactic disks rather than tidal gas caused by galaxy interactions or gas driven by galactic winds .",
    "furthermore , our models predict @xmath17 of sub - dla galaxies : @xmath264 for the hs model and @xmath265 for the ls model .",
    "these are roughly @xmath266 times larger than those of dla galaxies .",
    "we also find that there is no difference between the sub - dla @xmath17 for the two models . the reason is considered as follows . at a given redshift , the @xmath17 is described as @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is the number fraction of sub - dla galaxies to galaxies , @xmath269 is the number density of galaxies , and @xmath122 is the cross section of the galactic disk .",
    "we showed that there is little difference in the cross - sections @xmath122 between the models .",
    "however , for the hs model , the number fractions of sub - dlas @xmath268 are larger than those for the ls model , while the ls model produces the number densities @xmath270 higher than those of the hs model .",
    "this results in no significant difference between the values @xmath271 and @xmath17 for the two models .",
    "our result is also consistent with an estimation of @xmath272 at redshift @xmath273 on the basis of an analysis of the hi column density distributions of high - redshift sample @xcite .",
    "many ideas concerning the nature of dla systems have been proposed through observational / theoretical studies : large , massive spiral galaxies ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "1986 ) , proto - galactic infalling gas that is not virialized ( e.g. , haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 ) , and so on .",
    "although it is not clear which scenarios are valid , a dramatic change in the nature of dlas may occur at redshift @xmath274 from the results of the numerical simulations ( e.g. , gardner et al .",
    "2001 ; nagamine et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) and semi - analytic models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; maller et al . 2001",
    "; okoshi et al . 2004 ; okoshi and nagashima 2005 ; johansson and efstatiou 2006 ) . at redshift @xmath275",
    ", the radio observations suggest that compact hi objects ( @xmath1 ) mainly exhibit the hi column densities comparable to those of dla systems .",
    "they are consistent with our results showing that compactly bound systems including less massive ones ( @xmath13 ) show the basic properties of dla systems .",
    "if the compactly bound objects also comprise sub - dla galaxies , how can they be detected in the observations ?",
    "in future , when the large samples including less massive galaxies at @xmath251 become available , it is probable to identify them as sub - dla galaxies rather than dla ones .",
    "the hi - selected samples have an advantage in terms of detectability of the optical counterparts over those of quasar absorption systems , sub - dla systems .",
    "because the hi - selected samples provided by the blind surveys are not behind bright background quasars , they do not suffer from the masking effect .",
    "no glare of background quasars does not prevent from the detection of weak optical emission lines from the hi - selected galaxies if their surface brightness is very low",
    ". if the host galaxies of sub - dla systems are compact , the masking effect would be serious in the searches particularly for the optical counterparts of sub - dla systems just as much as dla systems . in the optical surveys for less massive galaxies ( @xmath13 )",
    ", it would be quite valuable to pay attention to some of the difficulties in detecting the sub - dla hosts due to the compactness and the faintness .",
    "some observations suggest that a sub - dla host comprises compact and less massive systems ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "for example , tripp et al .",
    "( 2005 ) explored a nearby sub - dla system with @xmath276 at @xmath277 on the periphery of the virgo cluster by using the space telescope imaging spectrograph on board the _ hubble space telescope_. they argue that they could not find any bright galaxies in the proximity of the line of sight toward the background quasar pg1216 + 019 .",
    "the nearest galaxy is a sub-@xmath89 galaxy with a projected distance of @xmath278 kpc .",
    "however , a radio observation successfully detected the radio emissions using the westerbrock synthesis radio telescope @xcite .",
    "the emission feature is very compact ; it is located within @xmath196 arcsec ( @xmath279 kpc ) of the quasar sight line .",
    "they argue that , because the velocity spread of the emission line is between @xmath249 and @xmath280 km s@xmath30 , the radio emission feature indicates the hi masses , @xmath281 @xmath282 .",
    "the result also suggests that compactly bound objects will be identified as the host galaxies of sub - dla systems .",
    "indeed , it may not be surprising that sub - dla galaxies are very optically faint , consistent with our result , e.g. , the mean luminosity in the @xmath3 band is @xmath283 at @xmath284 @xmath285 for the ls model .",
    "this observation agrees with our prediction that sub - dla galaxies with low hi - masses are very faint and compactly bound objects .",
    "sub - dla systems may be associated with high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "some radio observations show that the hvcs near m31 and m33 have typical hi column densities of @xmath180-@xmath286 @xmath15 , hi masses of @xmath287-@xmath288 and sizes of @xmath289 kpc @xcite . on the basis of estimates of the dynamical and virial masses ,",
    "the hvcs are likely gravitationally bounded systems . for hi clouds in the milky - way halo ,",
    "some of the absorption features in the spectra toward the background quasars are similar to those of intervening quasar absorption systems @xcite .",
    "these properties are consistent with those of sub - dla systems predicted by our models .",
    "it is probable that these systems are the sub - dla hosts .",
    "to reveal the sub - dla hosts , it needs to statistically compare the radio characteristics of the hvcs with the properties of intervening hi absorption systems toward quasar / gamma - ray burst .",
    "further investigation of the sub - dla hosts requires a large sample of less massive objects ( @xmath13 ) , which would be the candidates for sub - dla galaxies .",
    "indeed , a program aimed at obtaining a census of such less massive objects in a radio survey is now on going .",
    "a recent hi blind survey , the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey , aims to detect on the order of @xmath290 extragalactic hi emission sources out to @xmath291 including ones with hi masses @xmath292 by covering @xmath293 deg@xmath294 of sky @xcite .",
    "this survey is specifically designed to determine the basic properties of hi - selected galaxies statistically , including the determination of the himf , particularly at the faint end ( @xmath97 ) . in conjunction with optical studies ,",
    "the alfalfa survey will provide us with the basic properties of the optically faint and less massive galaxies including several results presented here : the sfr-@xmath2 relation , the relationship between hi cross section and @xmath2 , and the hi diameter function .",
    "the alfalfa survey is able to map the peripheries of hi - selected galaxies to a hi column - density limit on the order of @xmath295 @xmath15 that corresponds to the threshold of the sub - dla systems .",
    "this means that the survey also provides valuable opportunities for exploring the nature of quasar absorption systems , e.g. , sub - dla systems . in the near future ,",
    "comprehensive studies based on large samples of low hi - mass objects will reconcile the local galaxy population with the quasar absorption systems .",
    "we have investigated the properties of hi - selected galaxies in comparison with quasar absorption systems at redshift @xmath34 within a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario using a semi - analytic model . by drawing a detailed comparison between the properties of the hi - selected galaxies and the hi absorption systems",
    ", we find that dla galaxies consist primarily of optically - faint , compactly bound - systems .",
    "furthermore , for the purpose of reconciling the quasar absorption system with the galaxy population , we have investigated the properties of local hi - selected galaxies .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "the sfrs in hi - selected galaxies correlate tightly with the hi masses , sfr @xmath128 @xmath129 , @xmath6 in the range of hi mass @xmath7 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the sfr ranges widely from @xmath141 to @xmath134 @xmath29 yr@xmath30 with the mean logarithmic sfr @xmath296sfr [ @xmath29 yr@xmath144 \\rangle$ ] @xmath297 ( figure 8) .",
    "in contrast , the relationship between the @xmath4-band luminosity and the hi mass is quite broad ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "there is no statistically significant difference between hi mass functions of dla galaxies and galaxies at @xmath107 @xmath29 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that dla galaxies correspond primarily to hi - selected galaxies detected in blind radio surveys at @xmath107 @xmath29 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "sub - dla galaxies will replace dla ones as the dominant population ( figure 9 ) at the low - mass end ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the number fractions of sub - dla galaxies to galaxies are between @xmath298 and @xmath169 at @xmath11 and between @xmath299 and @xmath170 at @xmath13 .",
    "if the detection limits on the hi mass in the blind radio surveys are low enough to detect less massive systems ( @xmath13 ) , the population detected by the surveys will switch to being dominated by sub - dla galaxies instead of dla ones .",
    "in addition to being a good probe of dla systems , the hi - selected galaxies can be a strong probe of sub - dla systems .",
