    "there are various experimental methods to determine the boltzmann constant including acoustic gas thermometry @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; dielectric constant gas thermometry @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , johnson noise thermometry ( jnt ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and doppler broadening @xcite , @xcite .",
    "codata ( committee on data for science and technology ) will determine the boltzmann constant as a weighted average of estimates determined with these methods .",
    "here , we focus on jnt experiments which utilize a quantum - accurate voltage - noise source ( qvns ) .    in jnt ,",
    "one infers true thermodynamic temperature based on measurements of the fluctuating voltage and current noise caused by the random thermal motion of electrons in all conductors . according to the nyquist law , the mean square of the fluctuating voltage noise for frequencies below 1 ghz and temperature near 300 k can be approximated to better than 1 part in billion as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant",
    ", @xmath2 is the thermodynamic temperature , @xmath3 is the resistance of the sensor , and @xmath4 is the bandwidth over which the noise is measured .",
    "since jnt is a pure electronic measurement that is immune from chemical and mechanical changes in the material properties of the sensor , it is an appealing alternative to other forms of primary gas thermometry that are limited by the non - ideal properties of real gases .",
    "recently , interest in jnt has dramatically increased because of its potential contribution to the  new si \" ( new international system ) , in which the unit of thermodynamic temperature , the kelvin , will be redefined in 2018 by fixing the numerical value of @xmath1 .",
    "although almost certainly the value of @xmath1 will be primarily determined by the values obtained by acoustic gas thermometry , there remains the possibility of unknown systematic effects that might bias the results , and therefore an alternative determination using a different physical technique and different principles is necessary to ensure that any systematic effects must be small . to redefine the kelvin , the consultative committee on thermometry ( cct ) of the international committee for weights and measures ( cipm ) has required that",
    "besides the acoustic gas thermometry method , there must be another method that can determine @xmath1 with a relative uncertainty below 3@xmath5 . as of now",
    ", jnt is the most likely method to meet this requirement .    in actual experiments , transmission lines that connect the resistor and the qvns to preamplifiers",
    "produce a ratio spectrum that varies with frequency . due",
    "solely to impedance mismatch effects , for the frequencies of interest , one expects the ratio spectrum to be an even polynomial function of frequency where the constant term ( offset ) in the polynomial is the value @xmath6 provided that dielectric losses are negligible .",
    "the theoretical justification for this polynomial model is based on low - frequency filter theory where measurements are modeled by a  lumped - parameter approximation . \"",
    "in particular , one models the networks for the resistor and the qvns as combination of series and parallel complex impedances where the impedance coupling in the resistor network is somewhat different from that in the qvns network .",
    "for the ideal case where all shunt capacitive impedances are real , there are no dielectric losses . as a caveat , in actual experiments , other effects including electromagnetic interference and filtering aliasing also affect the ratio spectrum . as discussed in @xcite , for the the recent experiment of interest , dielectric losses and other effects are small compared to impedance mismatch effects . as an aside , impedance mismatch effects also influence results in jnt experiments that do not utilize a qvns @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    based on a fit of the ratio spectrum model to the observed ratio spectrum , one determines the offset parameter @xmath6 .",
    "given this estimate of @xmath6 and values of other terms on the right hand sided of eq .",
    "3 ( which are known or measured ) , one determines the boltzmann constant .",
    "however , the choice of the order @xmath7 ( complexity ) of the polynomial ratio spectrum model and the upper frequency cutoff for analysis ( fitting bandwidth @xmath8 ) significantly affects both the estimate and its associated uncertainty . in jnt",
    ", researchers typically select the model complexity and fitting bandwidth based on scientific judgement informed by graphical analysis of results .",
    "a common approach is to restrict attention to sufficiently low fitting bandwidths where curvature in the ratio spectrum is not too dramatic and assume that a quadratic spectrum model is valid ( see @xcite for an example of this approach ) .",
    "in contrast to a practitioner - dependent subjective approach , we present a data - driven objective method to select the complexity of the ratio spectrum model and the fitting bandwidth .",
    "in particular , we select the ratio spectrum model based on cross - validation @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we note that in addition to cross - validation , there are other model selection methods including those based on the akaike information criterion ( aic ) @xcite , the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite , @xmath9 statistics @xcite .",
    "however , cross - validation is more data - driven and flexible than these other approaches because it relies on fewer modeling assumptions . since the selected model determined by any method is a function of random data , none perform perfectly . hence , uncertainty due to imperfect model selection performance should be accounted for in the uncertainty budget for any parameter of interest @xcite , @xcite .",
    "failure to account for uncertainty in the selected model generally leads to underestimation of uncertainty .    in cross - validation ,",
    "one splits observed data into training and validation subsets .",
    "one fits candidate models to training data , and selects the model that is most consistent with validation data that are independent of the training data . here",
    "( and in most studies ) consistency is measured with a cross - validation statistic equal to the mean square deviation between predicted and observed values in validation data .",
    "we stress that , in general , this mean square deviation depends on both random and systematic effects . for each candidate model",
    ", practitioners sometimes average cross - validation statistics from many random splits of the data into training and validation data set @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here , from many random splits , we instead determine model selection fractions determined from a five - fold cross - validation analysis .",
    "based on these model selection fractions , we determine the uncertainty of the offset parameter for each fitting bandwidth of interest .",
    "we select @xmath8 by minimizing this uncertainty .",
    "as far as we know , our resampling approach for quantification of uncertainty due to random effects and imperfect performance of model selected by five - fold cross - validation is new . as an aside , for the case where models are selected based on @xmath9 statistics , efron @xcite determined model selection fractions with a bootstrap resampling scheme .    in @xcite , the complexity of the ratio spectrum and the fitting bandwidth",
    "were selected with an earlier version of the method described here for the case where @xmath8 was no greater than 600 khz . here ,",
    "we re - analyze the data from @xcite but allow @xmath8 to be as large as 1400 khz . in this work",
    ", we also quantify an additional component of uncertainty that accounts for we stress that this work focuses only on the uncertainty of the offset parameter in ratio spectrum model . for a discussion of other sources of uncertainty that affect the estimate of the boltzmann constant , see @xmath10 . in a simulation study",
    ", we show that our methods correctly selects the correct ratio spectrum for simulated data with additive noise similar to observed data .",
    "finally , for experimental data , we quantify evidence for a possible linear temporal trend in estimates for the offset parameter .",
    "following @xcite , to account for impedance mismatch effects , we model the ratio of the power spectral densities , @xmath11 , as a @xmath7th order even polynomial function of frequency as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a reference frequency ( 1 mhz in this work ) . throughout this work , as shorthand , we refer to this model as a @xmath15 model if @xmath16 , a @xmath17 model if @xmath18 , and so on . the constant term , @xmath19 in the eq .",
    "4 model corresponds to @xmath20      the time to acquire data varied from 15 h to 20 h. for each run , fourier transforms of time series corresponding to the resistor at the triple point of water temperature and the qvns were determined at a resolution of 1 hz for frequencies up to 2 mhz .",
    "were formed for frequency blocks of width 1.8 khz .",
    "for the frequency block with midpoint @xmath21 , for the @xmath22th run , we denote the estimate for the resistor and qvns for the @xmath22th run as @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively where @xmath25 1,2 , @xmath26 45 .",

    "we denote the values @xmath19 and @xmath27 as @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "even though @xmath32 and @xmath33 vary from run - to - run , we assume that temporal variation of their difference , @xmath34 , is negligible .",
    "later in this work , we check the validity of this key modeling assumption .",
    "the component of uncertainty of the estimate of @xmath27 for any run due to imperfect knowledge of @xmath3 is approximately 2 @xmath35 .",
    "the estimated weighted mean value of our estimates , @xmath36 , is 1.000100961 .",
    "the weights are determined from relative data acquisition times for the runs .",
    "following @xcite , for each frequency , we pool data from all 45 runs to form a numerator term @xmath37 and a denominator term @xmath38 . from these two terms , we estimate one ratio for each frequency as ( see figure 1 ) . from the eq . 6 ratio spectrum",
    ", we estimate one residual offset term @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the weighted mean of @xmath27 values from all runs .      in our cross - validation approach ,",
    "we select the model that produces the prediction ( determined from the training data ) that is most consistent with the validation data .",
    "since @xmath27 varies from run - to - run , we correct @xmath41 spectra so that our cross - validation statistic is not artificially inflated by in @xmath27 .",
    "the corrected ratio spectrum for the @xmath22th run is where @xmath42 in effect , given that our calibration experiment measurement of @xmath33 has negligible systematic error , the above correction returns produces a spectrum where the values of @xmath19 should be nearly the same for all runs .",
    "we stress that after selecting the model , we estimate @xmath43 from the uncorrected eq .",
    "6 spectrum .    in our cross - validation method , we generate 20 000 random five - way splits of the data .",
    "in each five - way split , we assign the pair of spectra , ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 , from any particular run to one of the five subsets by a resampling method .",
    "each of the 45 spectral pairs appears in one and only one of the five subsets .",
    "we resample spectra according to run to retain possible correlation structure within the spectrum for any particular run .",
    "each simulated five - way split is determined by a random permutation of the positive integers from 1 to 45 .",
    "the first nine permuted integers corresponds to the runs assigned to the first subset .",
    "the second nine correspond to the runs assigned to the second subset , and so on . from each random split , four of the subsets are aggregated to form training data , and the other subset forms the validation data . within the training data , we pool all @xmath44 spectrum and all @xmath46 spectrum and form one ratio spectrum . similarly , for the validation data , we pool all @xmath41 spectrum and @xmath46 spectrum and form one ratio spectrum .",
    "we fit each candidate polynomial ratio spectrum model to the training data , and predict the observed ratio spectrum in the validation data based on this fit .",
    "we then compute the ( empirical ) mean squared deviation ( msd ) between predicted and observed ratios for the validation data .",
    "for any random five - way split , there are five ways of defining the validation .",
    "hence , we compute five msd values for each random split . the cross - validation statistic for each @xmath7 ,",
    "cv(@xmath7 ) , is the average of these five msd values .",

    "to get some insight into this issue , we study the performance of our method for idealized simulated data that are free of systematic measurement error .",
    "we simulate three realizations of data based on the estimated values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 in table 3 . in our simulation , for each run , we set @xmath78 = 0 , @xmath79 = 1 and @xmath80 equals the sum of the predicted ratio spectrum and gaussian white noise . for each run",
    ", the variance of the noise is determined from fitting the ratio spectrum model to the experimental ratio spectrum for that run . for simulated data ,",
    "the @xmath7 , @xmath69 and @xmath81 spectra exhibit fluctuations similar to those in the experimental data ( figures 4,5,6 ) .",

    "the difference between the two results , 0.55 @xmath31 , is small compared to the uncertainty of either result .",
    "we expect imperfections in our fitting bandwidth selection method for various reasons .",
    "first , we conduct a grid search with a resolution of 25 khz rather than a search over a continuum of frequencies .",
    "second , there are surely fluctuations in @xmath69 due to random effects that vary with fitting bandwidth .",
    "third , different values of @xmath8 can yield very similar values of @xmath69 but somewhat different values of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to determine an additional component of uncertainty , @xmath89 , that accounts for uncertainty due to imperfect here we equate @xmath89 to the estimated standard deviation of estimates of @xmath90 corresponding to the five @xmath8 values that yielded the lowest @xmath69 values ( figures 3 and 7 ) .",

    "@xmath94 3.29 @xmath31 . as a caveat",
    ", the choice to quantify @xmath89 as the standard deviation of the estimates corresponding to @xmath8 values that yield the five lowest values is based on scientific judgement .",
    "for instance , if we determine @xmath95 based on the the @xmath8 values that yield the ten lowest rather the five lowest values @xmath69 , for the three simulation cases and the observed data we get @xmath96 0.55 @xmath31 , 1.08 @xmath31 , 1.42 @xmath31 , and 0.73 @xmath31 respectively .      from the corrected eq.7 spectra",
    ", we estimate @xmath97 for each of the 45 runs by fitting our selected ratio spectrum model ( @xmath98 8 and @xmath83 1250 khz ) to the data from each run by the method of ls ( figure 8) .",
    "ideally , on average , these estimates should not from run - to - run assuming that our eq . 8 correction model based on calibration data is valid .",
    "from these estimates , we determine the slope and intercept parameters for a linear trend model by the method of weighted least squares ( wls ) where we minimize @xmath99 above , for the @xmath22th run , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the estimated and predicted ( according to the trend model ) values of @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the inverse of the squared asymptotic uncertainty of associated with our estimate determined by the ls fit to data from the @xmath22th run .",
    "we determine the uncertainty of the trend model parameters with a nonparametric bootstrap method ( see appendix 1 ) following @xcite ( table 5 ) .",
    "we repeat the bootstrap procedure but set @xmath104 to a constant .",
    "this analysis yields an estimate of the null distribution of the slope estimate corresponding to the hypothesis that there is no trend .",
    "the fraction of bootstrap slope estimates with magnitude greater than or equal to the magnitude of the estimated slope determined from the observed data is the bootstrap @xmath105-value @xcite corresponding to a two - tailed test of the null hypothesis .",
    "for the @xmath8 values that yield the five lowest values of @xmath106 , our bootstrap analysis provides strong evidence that @xmath102 varies with time . at the value of @xmath82 575 khz",
    ", there is a moderate amount of evidence for a trend .    for each @xmath8 choice ,",
    "we test the hypothesis that the linear trend is consistent with observations based on the value of @xmath107 .",
    "if the observed data are consistent with the trend model , a resulting @xmath105-value from this test is realization of a random variable with a distribution that is approximately uniform between 0 and 1 .",
    "hence , the large @xmath105-values reported column 7 of table 5 suggest that the asymptotic uncertainties determined by the ls method for each run may be inflated . as a check",
    ", we estimate the slope uncertainty with a parametric bootstrap method where we simulate bootstrap replications of the observed data by adding gaussian noise to the estimated trend with standard deviations equal to the asymptotic uncertainties determined by the ls method .",
    "in contrast to the method from @xcite , the parametric bootstrap method yields larger slope uncertainties .",
    "for instance , for the 1250 khz and 575 khz cases , the parametric bootstrap slope uncertainty estimates are larger than the corresponding table 5 estimates by 30 @xmath108 and 23 @xmath108 respectively",
    ".    could result due to heteroscedasticity ( frequency dependent additive measurement error variances ) .",
    "this follows from the well - known fact that when models are fit to heteroscedastic data , the variance of parameter estimates determined by the ls method are larger than the variance of parameter estimates determined by the ideal wls method .",
    "based on fits of selected models to data pooled from all runs , we test the hypothesis that the variance of the additive noise in the ratio spectrum is independent of frequency . based on the breush - pagan method @xcite , the @xmath105-values corresponding to the test of this hypothesis are 0.723 , 0.064 , 0.006 , 0.001 , 0.001 and 0.001 for fitting bandwidths of 575 khz , 900 khz , 1150 khz , 1175 khz , 1225 khz , and 1250 khz respectively .",
    "hence , the evidence for heteroscedasticity is very strong for the larger fitting bandwidths .    for a fitting bandwidth of 1250 khz ,",
    "the variation of the estimated trend over the duration of the experiment is @xmath109 .",
    "in contrast , the uncertainty of our estimate of @xmath110 determined under the assumption that there is no trend is only 3.29 @xmath31 ( table 4 ) .",
    "the evidence for a linear trend at particular fitting bandwidths above 900 khz is strong ( p - values are 0.012 or less ) ( column 5 in table 5 ) . in contrast , the evidence ( from hypothesis testing ) for a linear trend at 575 khz ( the selected fitting bandwidth in @xcite ) is not as strong since the p - value is 0.049 .",
    "however , the larger p - value at 575 khz may be due to more random variability in the estimated offset parameters rather than lack of a deterministic trend in the offset parameters .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the uncertainty of the estimated slope parameter due to random effects generally increases as the fitting bandwidth is reduced , and that fact that all of the slope parameter estimates for cases shown in table 5 are negative and vary from -0.440 @xmath31 / day to -0.164 @xmath31 / day . together , these observations strongly suggest a deterministic trend in measured offset parameters at a fitting bandwidth of 575 khz . currently , experimental efforts are underway to understand the physical source of this ( possible ) temporal trend .",
    "if there is a linear temporal trend in the offset parameters at a fitting bandwidth of 575 khz , with slope similar to what we estimate from data , the reported uncertainty for the boltzmann constant reported in @xcite is optimistic because the trend was not accounted for in the uncertainty budget . to account for the effect of a linear trend on results",
    ", one must estimate the associated systematic error due to the trend at some particular time .",
    "unfortunately , we have no empirical method to do this . as a further complication ,",
    "if there is a trend , it may not be exactly linear .",
    "for electronic measurements of the boltzmann constant by jnt , we presented a data - driven method to select the complexity of a ratio spectrum model with a cross - validation method . for each candidate fitting bandwidth , we quantified the uncertainty of the offset parameter in the spectral ratio model in a way that accounts for random effects as well as systematic effects associated with imperfect knowledge of model complexity .",
    "we selected the fitting bandwidth that minimizes this uncertainty .",
    "we also quantified an additional component of uncertainty that accounts for imperfect knowledge of the selected fitting bandwidth . with our method , we re - analyzed data from a recent experiment by considering a broader range of fitting bandwidths and found evidence for a temporal linear trend in offset paramaters . for idealized simulated data free of systematic error with additive noise similar to experimental data ,",
    "our method correctly selected the true complexity of the ratio spectrum model for all cases considered . in the future",
    ", we plan to study how well our methods work for other experimental and simulated jnt data sets with variable signal - to - noise ratios and investigate how robust our method is to systematic measurement errors .",
    "we expect our method to find broad metrological applications including selection of optimal virial equation models in gas thermometry experiments , and selection of line - width models in doppler broadening thermometry experiments",
