    "grain boundaries in graphene have been found to affect the mechanical , electronic and thermal properties of the material@xcite .",
    "the grain boundaries commonly consist of dislocations , in the form of pentagon - heptagon defect pairs , and cause out - of - plane buckling of the graphene sheet@xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies show that dislocations can be introduced into pristine graphene using a focused electron beam@xcite , suggesting the possibility of adjusting the properties of the material .",
    "the possibility of manipulating the properties of graphene could be particularly important in applications related to phononics and heat management@xcite , where control of the vibrational properties and thermal conductivity of graphene is essential .",
    "the effect of grain boundaries on the thermal conductivity of graphene has previously been studied using both molecular dynamics and greens function methods @xcite . however ,",
    "out of these studies only liu et al.@xcite , who consider transport along the boundary , mention the influence of out - of - plane buckling .",
    "also , these studies give no detailed insight into the scattering processes of specific phonon modes .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the scattering of long - wavelength flexural acoustic phonons at grain boundaries in graphene for several incidence angles using molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "this particluar phonon mode was chosen since it is believed to contribute significantly to the thermal conductivity@xcite .",
    "two grain boundaries are considered in this paper , one with a misorientation angle of @xmath1 and one with a misorientation angle of @xmath2 .",
    "both grain boundaries display substantial out - of - plane buckling , with a periodic variation in height along the grain boundary due to the distribution of defects .",
    "the boundaries are found to act as diffraction gratings for the phonons , and strongly suppressed transmission is also observed for specific angles . in particular , the transmission is as low as 4 % for incidence angles near @xmath0 at both boundaries .",
    "a previous investigation limited to phonons normally incident on the grain boundary showed that the scattering was due almost entirely to the out - of - plane buckling of the boundary@xcite . based on this result",
    "a continuum mechanical model was constructed , where the grain boundary was modeled as a static out - of - plane displacement .",
    "the model showed good agreement with the md results . here , we extend this continuum mechanical model to the case of non - normal angle of incidence in order to gain a qualitative understanding of the scattering mechanism .",
    "all md simulations have been performed using the program package lammps ( large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator)@xcite .",
    "the interaction between carbon atoms has been modeled using the tersoff potential@xcite with the potential parameters given by lindsay and broido@xcite .",
    "this set of parameters has been chosen due to its improved description of acoustic phonon modes in graphene .",
    "the considered grain boundaries are symmetric tilt grain boundaries and consists of periodic arrays of pentagon - heptagon defects .",
    "the @xmath1 grain boundary has a period of 1.5 nm in the @xmath3 direction , parallel to the grain boundary ( see figure [ fig : gb ] ) , while the @xmath2 boundary has a period of 2.4 nm .",
    "the grain boundaries have been constructed using the method described in ref . .",
    "for the @xmath1 boundary this results in a grain boundary buckling @xmath4 nm high and @xmath5 nm wide .",
    "due to the defect distribution the buckling height varies periodically along the grain boundary with an amplitude of @xmath6 nm . the @xmath2 boundary has a buckling height of 1.5 nm and a buckling width of 5 nm , wih a variation of 0.1 nm along the boundary .    ,",

    "the amplitudes @xmath15 are calculated according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an amplitude and @xmath18 is the width of the wavepacket in the @xmath19 direction ( perpendicular to the grain boundary ) .",
    "the resulting wavepacket is localized in the @xmath19 direction , centered around @xmath20 in real space and around a wavevector @xmath21 in reciprocal space .",
    "all wavevectors @xmath22 are required to be reciprocal lattice vectors of the simulation supercell . with periodic boundary conditions applied in the @xmath3 direction ( parallel to the grain boundary )",
    "this gives @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an integer and @xmath25 is the size of the supercell in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the polarization vectors @xmath12 and dispersion relation @xmath26 have been obtained from the dynamical matrix of the perfect lattice using the general utility lattice program , gulp@xcite , and the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been set to @xmath27 and @xmath28 nm , respectively .",
    "since the focus of this study is long - wavelength phonons , the upper limit for @xmath29 has been set to @xmath30 nm@xmath31 , which limits the possible values of @xmath24 and @xmath32 . to extend",
    "the range of possible @xmath24 values the size of the simulation supercells in the @xmath3 direction has been increased . for the @xmath1 boundary",
    "it has been tripled , so that @xmath33 nm , while for the @xmath2 boundary it has been doubled , giving @xmath34 nm . the supercells of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 boundaries are 260 and 400 nm long in the @xmath19 direction , respectively .",
    "fixed boundary conditions are applied in this direction and all atoms less than @xmath35 nm from the supercell edge are held immobile .    in our previous study of phonon scattering at graphene grain boundaries a simple continuum mechanical model of the system",
    "was constructed in order to further confirm the results and to facilitate future studies of systems too large to model using md@xcite . the model built on the observation that the main cause for scattering of long - wavelength phonons at the grain boundary is the buckling . here , we have extended the previously used model from one to two dimensions for the case of the @xmath1 boundary , and incorporated the periodic height variation of the buckling .",

    "the grain boundary buckling has been included in the form of a static out - of - plane displacement .",
    "finite - difference time - domain methods have been used to propagate wavepackets similar to the ones used in md and to study scattering against the buckling .",
    "results of these calculations can be directly compared to the md simulation results .",
    "the details of the continuum mechanical model can be found in the appendix .",
    "the time evolution of the kinetic energy in both grains for a wavepacket with @xmath44 nm and @xmath45 interacting with the @xmath1 boundary can be seen in figure [ fig : ekin_t ] . here , grain 1 is defined as the grain in which the pulse is introduced , and grain 2 is the other grain .",
    "changes in the kinetic energy of the grains can be seen at two points .",
    "after @xmath46 ps , the kinetic energy in grain 1 decreases to @xmath47  % of the total kinetic energy while the kinetic energy of grain 2 increases to 27  % , indicating that the pulse has reached the grain boundary .",
    "the second change occurs at @xmath48 ps , where the energy of grain 1 decreases further in two steps , first to @xmath48  % and then to @xmath49  % . between these two points",

    "[ fig : ekin_t ] ]    the most surprising feature of figure [ fig : ekin_t ] is the stepwise change in energy beginning at @xmath48 ps , which seems to indicate that there are two pulses arriving at the grain boundary about @xmath28 ps apart .",
    "a closer examination of the scattered pulses shows that this is indeed the case .",

    "t1 has the same wavevector as the incident pulse .",
    "since the propagation velocity of the pulse depends on the value of @xmath50 , these two pulses will propagate with different velocities and thus give rise to the stepwise change in kinetic energy seen in figure [ fig : ekin_t ] .",

    "the @xmath50 value of the scattered pulses , @xmath74 , is given by momentum conservation : @xmath75 this shows that the buckled , periodic grain boundaries act as diffraction gratings for long - wavelength flexural acoustic phonons .",
    "grain boundaries functioning as diffraction gratings for phonons has previoulsy been used to model the behaviour of the thermal conductivity in ionic materials@xcite .    unlike the previously described case where @xmath76@xcite , scattering into in - plane vibrational modes is negligible for all cases with @xmath77 and @xmath45 . some movement in the @xmath3 direction",

    "it is clear that the same peaks appear , showing that diffraction occurs also in the continuum mechanical model .",

    "the presented results improve our understanding of how phonons interact with grain boundaries in graphene and suggest that such defects could indeed be useful in manipulating the vibrational properties of the material .",
