    "we calculate the spectrum as a function of @xmath193 and use @xmath194 t. for the resonance field @xmath195 mhz used in the experiment @xcite this is consistent with @xmath196 where @xmath197 mhz / t @xcite . a comparison of formula ( [ ks2 ] ) for this set of material - dependent parameters with experiment",

    "note that the sample used for the nmr experiment has been annealed thus dramatically reducing the amount of excess oxygen and the associated chain breaks compared to the sample used for the susceptibility measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_fit ] .",
    "the theory predicts a central peak corresponding to the bulk susceptibility value and two shoulders with separation @xmath203 ( see curve theory i in fig .  [ fig_nmr ] ) which are caused by the maxima of the local susceptibility ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig_chain ] ) . theoretically , we find that @xmath204 , i.e. , the separation of the shoulders increases @xmath205 with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "the central peak , however , has a much more complex structure than predicted .",
    "the peak is split ( feature @xmath206 in fig .",
    "[ fig_nmr ] ) and has prominent shoulders ( feature @xmath207 in fig .",
    "[ fig_nmr ] ) .",
    "these features are only observed in experiment at temperatures @xmath208 k , whereas at higher temperatures the theoretical prediction agrees well with experimental data ( not shown ) .    to explain the additional features in the nmr spectra at @xmath208 k we have to take the interchain coupling into account .",
    "sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 shows three - dimensional nel ordering at @xmath209 k. according to the usual chain mean field argument the interchain coupling should therefore also be of order @xmath210 k. this estimate is consistent with band structure calculations @xcite . as we have already demonstrated numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig_ladder ] , a ladder - like interchain coupling as present in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 leads to a reflection of susceptibility oscillations .",
    "therefore another typical knight shift is expected to be present in the nmr spectra , related to the maxima of the reflected oscillations .",
    "as long as @xmath211 we can calculate this effect perturbatively .",
    "starting from the definition of the local susceptibility given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) we obtain to first order @xmath212 here , the lower index @xmath96 stands for the infinitely long chain without chain breaks whereas the lower index @xmath213 denotes the chain with a chain break at site @xmath214 .",
    "both , the two - point correlation @xmath215 and the local susceptibility @xmath216 have a uniform and a staggered part in the low temperature limit .",
    "we therefore find @xmath217 with @xmath218 and @xmath219 here eq .",
    "( [ staggpart4 ] ) has to be used for @xmath220 while @xmath221^{k}$ ] is the staggered part of the bulk two - point correlation function . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ladder ] , formula ( [ reflection ] ) is compared with the numerical result and good agreement is found .",
    "if we take these reflections into account , then also the additional features in the nmr spectra are explained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nmr ] ( curve theory ii ) .",
    "in particular , the shoulders with separation @xmath222 directly correspond to the maxima of the reflected susceptibility oscillations .",
    "the splitting of the peak @xmath206 is of different origin .",
    "it is in fact not a splitting but rather a loss of intensity at the value which corresponds to the bulk susceptibility .",
    "the oscillations and reflected oscillations spread over the entire crystal at low temperatures so that there are simply no sites left which show bulk behavior . rather interestingly ,",
    "the peak usually associated with the bulk susceptibility value therefore turns into a dip at low temperatures due to the presence of chain breaks and interchain couplings .",
    "finally , we also want to shed some light on the role played by the geometry of the interchain couplings .",
    "to this end , we consider an interchain coupling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_geom](c ) .",
    "such a coupling is realized in srcuo@xmath0 with a ferromagnetic @xmath223 $ ] @xcite .",
    "using again first order perturbation theory we find in this case @xmath224 separating this into a uniform and a staggered part we find @xmath225 and @xmath226 therefore no reflections will occur in this case to first order in perturbation theory consistent with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_zigzag ] .",
    "this also means that an nmr spectrum for srcuo@xmath0 would not show any shoulders associated with the coupling to the nearest neighbor chain .",
    "reflections in chains further away might , however , be still possible which then would again lead to additional structures in the nmr spectra at low temperatures .",
    "we have investigated here how chain breaks and interchain couplings affect the physical properties of spin chain compounds .",
    "a weak coupling of two heisenberg chains is an irrelevant perturbation in the renormalization group sense whereas the weakening of a bond in an otherwise homogenous chain is relevant .",
    "open boundary conditions are therefore the stable fix point .",
    "due to this reasoning it is expected that a wide class of perturbations like impurities or dislocations present in any real compound can be effectively described at low energies as a chain break .",
    "an experimental measurement then corresponds to taking an average over an ensemble of finite chain segments with open boundaries .    by combining a low - energy effective field theory with bethe ansatz",
    "we have derived parameter - free formulas for the thermodynamics of finite spin-@xmath2 heisenberg chains with open boundary conditions .",
    "particular emphasis was put on a calculation of the susceptibility . due to the broken translational invariance",
    "there exists a site - dependent staggered susceptibility in addition to the uniform site - independent part .",
    "however , even the uniform part is affected by the open boundary conditions in the sense that a surface contribution arises which is not present for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown that susceptibility measurements on sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 doped with non - magnetic pd ions are well described by the theory presented here .",
    "one of the complications arising for this compound is , however , that even the undoped sample apparently already has a relatively large amount of chain breaks which are believed to be caused by excess oxygen .",
    "the impurity concentration used in the theory to fit the experimental data therefore differs significantly from the nominal pd concentration .",
    "the emerging picture nevertheless seems to be consistent - at least at low impurity concentrations - with a fixed concentration of additional chain breaks already present in the undoped sample .",
    "it would certainly be of some value to obtain experimental data for this or some other spin - chain compound where the impurity concentration is well controlled and a direct comparison with theory therefore possible .",
    "furthermore , we used the field theory to calculate nmr spectra .",
    "importantly , the knight shift is proportional to the _ local _ susceptibility so that the staggered site - dependent part of the susceptibility , which can not be observed in a bulk susceptibility measurement , becomes observable .",
    "as has already been shown previously @xcite , the staggered susceptibility leads to a broad background in the nmr spectra with edges caused by the maxima of the staggered susceptibility .",
    "for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 it has , however been found that the nmr spectra at low temperatures show puzzling additional features which have been ascribed in @xcite to a coupling to phonons .",
    "here we have shown that these features quite naturally arise in a spin - only model if the known interchain couplings are taken into account .",
    "it is also important to note that the geometry of the interchain couplings is crucial . as a specific example we considered in addition to the ladder - like",
    "interchain coupling relevant for sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 also the zigzag - like interchain coupling realized in srcuo@xmath0 . in the latter case",
    "no additional structures in the nmr spectra related to this interchain coupling will occur .",
    "nmr experiments on spin chain compounds are therefore not only helpful to study impurity effects , they can also be used to investigate the geometry and strength of interchain couplings .",
