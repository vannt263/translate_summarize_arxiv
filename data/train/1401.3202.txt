    "this consideration has stimulated a large body of research aimed at the design of high - capacity backhaul links  @xcite .",
    "one design challenge is that the use of high - order constellations to increase throughput ( @xmath4 qam has been recently demonstrated in commercial products ) makes the overall system extremely sensitive to _ phase noise _ ,",
    "i.e. , to phase and frequency instabilities in the radio - frequency ( rf ) oscillators used at the transmitter and the receiver . a fundamental way to characterize the impact of phase noise on the throughput of microwave backhaul links is to study their shannon capacity .",
    "unfortunately , the capacity of the phase - noise channel is not known in closed form even for simple channel models , although capacity bounds and asymptotic results in the limiting regime of high snr have been reported in the literature .",
    "lapidoth characterized the capacity of the general class of stationary phase - noise channels ( the widely used wiener model  @xcite belongs to this class ) in the high - snr regime  @xcite .",
    "specifically , he showed that whenever the phase - noise process has finite differential - entropy rate , the high - snr capacity is equal to half the capacity of an awgn channel with the same snr , plus a correction term that accounts for the memory in the phase - noise process .",
    "this result has been recently extended to the _ waveform _ phase - noise channel in  @xcite .",
    "the high - snr capacity of the block - memoryless phase - noise channel ( a non - stationary channel ) has been characterized in  @xcite .",
    "    for the non - asymptotic regime of finite snr , only capacity bounds are available in the literature .",
    "katz and shamai  @xcite provided tight upper and lower bounds on the capacity of the memoryless phase - noise channel .",
    "they also established that the capacity - achieving distribution is discrete with an infinite number of mass points .",

    "the impact of phase noise on the achievable rates of massive mimo systems has been recently discussed in  @xcite .",

    "we present a non - asymptotic capacity upper bound for the case of wiener phase noise and the practically relevant scenario when the transmit codewords are subject to a peak - power constraint , which is more stringent than the average - power constraint analyzed so far in the phase - noise literature .",
    "this upper bound improves on the one recently reported in  @xcite , which was derived under the assumption of codewords subject to an average - power constraint . when particularized to constant - modulus constellations and to single - antenna systems , our bound recovers the upper bound obtained in  @xcite .",

    "the gap between our upper bound and the information rates achievable with 64-qam is about @xmath2 for medium / high snr values .",
