    "the production of heavy flavour ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks ) in @xmath4 collisions has been studied at lep  @xcite for many years and will be an important field of study at tesla  @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied in proton - photon collisions at hera  @xcite , and in proton - proton collisions at the tevatron  @xcite . whereas originally the measured charm cross sections were well described by the parton evolution according to the standard collinear approach , the measured beauty cross sections were a factor 2 - 4 larger than predictions .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that an improved description of the heavy quark fragmentation function together with new parametrizations of structure functions and resumming next - to - leading logarithms in nlo qcd calculations result in an improved description of the b meson cross section in @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions .",
    "also the application of @xmath7-factorization and an unintegrated gluon density for the proton gives beauty cross sections which are in good agreement with data from @xmath5 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate if the @xmath8 cross section also can be explained in @xmath9 collisions by using @xmath7- factorization and an unintegrated gluon density for the photon .    in a previous study @xcite , using @xmath7-factorization , the unintegrated gluon density in the photon was calculated using a simplified solution to the ccfm formalism @xcite proposed by @xcite . as an alternative approach also a generalization of the gbw saturation model @xcite",
    "was used to obtain the unintegrated gluon density . in the present study",
    "we will use the complete ccfm evolution equations to determine the unintegrated gluon density in the photon and calculate the heavy quark cross section with help of the cascade monte carlo program .",
    "it is well known that the proton not only consists of three valence quarks , but also of virtual gluons that hold the quarks together .",
    "these gluons can split up in quark - antiquark pairs , called sea quarks , which in turn can emit gluons , see figure  [ photon]a .",
    "a photon colliding with a proton may therefore interact either with one of the valence quarks or with one of the sea quarks .    in analogy with the proton",
    ", a photon can be seen as a flux of ( virtual ) quarks and gluons . however , the photon does not consist of any valence quarks , and must first fluctuate into a virtual quark - antiquark pair which can emit gluons , see figure  [ photon]b . when a photon interacts with a virtual quark in another photon , the former is said to resolve the latter .",
    "how much of the photon that is resolved depends on the resolving power ( virtuality @xmath10 ) of the photon .",
    "so , what a photon with a low @xmath10 will resolve as a quark , a photon with a higher @xmath10 might resolve as a quark and a gluon which is radiated by the quark , sharing the original quark momentum .",
    "a photon with a very high @xmath10 may also resolve the soft gluon as having split up in a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this means that the more we resolve the more quarks we see at smaller @xmath11 , since each daughter particle must have less momentum than the mother .",
    "the density of quarks and gluons thus depends on @xmath10 , a phenomenon called scaling violation . for photons ,",
    "this @xmath10 dependence occurs already with the anomalous part of the splitting , i.e. the splitting of the photon into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the density of quarks and gluons is described by the density function @xmath12 which is just the probability that a parton of type @xmath13 ( quark or gluon ) is carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 of the photon , at a scale @xmath14 .",
    "the scale is generally denoted @xmath15 , since it does not always have to be the virtuality of the photon that sets the scale .",
    "the structure function of the photon can then be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electric charge of parton @xmath13 and one sums over all quark flavours .",
    "of course , the photons can not interact with the gluons , since @xmath18 , and @xmath19 does not depend on the gluon structure function explicitly ( in lo and nlo in the dis factorization scheme @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the quark density at small @xmath11 is driven by the gluon density , it is possible to extract @xmath20 . in general , the cross section that a parton @xmath13 from one photon will interact with a parton @xmath21 from another photon and form the final state @xmath22 is @xmath23 where the parton densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe the probability of finding partons @xmath13 and @xmath21 with momentum fractions @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the partonic cross section @xmath28 describes the probability that the two particles @xmath13 and @xmath21 will create the final state @xmath22 .",
    "the partonic cross section is proportional to the square of a matrix element ( me ) , which in turn depends on the masses , virtualities , couplings etc . of the particles involved .",
    "the integral is over all @xmath26 and @xmath27 allowed by the kinematics . unlike the partonic cross section , the parton densities",
    "can not be calculated from first principles . instead ,",
    "experimental fits and phenomenological methods must be used in order to describe the parton distributions inside the photon .",
    "all factors in equation  ( [ xsec ] ) above only depend on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 and the scale @xmath15 .",
    "this means that all partons are assumed to travel in the same direction as the incoming particle , i.e. they have no transverse momenta .",
    "it is therefore called a collinear approximation . however , at large energies , where small @xmath11 gluons are probed , the transverse momenta @xmath7 of the partons are expected to be important . therefore , the cross sections are factorized  @xcite into a @xmath7-dependent partonic cross section @xmath29 , where the incoming partons are treated off - mass shell , and a @xmath7-dependent parton density function @xmath30 .",
    "the equivalent to equation  ( [ xsec ] ) then becomes @xmath31 the function @xmath30 is called the ( @xmath7- ) unintegrated gluon density and is related to the collinear one by @xmath32 where @xmath30 describes the probability to find a gluon with a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 and a transverse momentum @xmath7 at a scale @xmath15 . inverting the relation ( [ pdf1 ] ) gives that an unintegrated gluon density may be obtained by differentiating an integrated gluon density with respect to @xmath15 , @xmath33 note that the unintegrated gluon density obtained in this way only depends on one scale , since @xmath34 . to distinguish the different parton distributions ,",
    "the notation following @xcite is used : @xmath35 is the parton distribution in the collinear approach , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the one- and two - scale distributions in the @xmath7-factorization approach .",
    "when using off - shell matrix elements of leading order ( @xmath38 ) , some next - to leading order ( @xmath39 ) processes in the collinear approach are effectively included , in addition to all collinear leading order processes .",
    "heavy quark production in photon collisions can be explained by three mechanisms , shown in figure  [ prodmech ] . at small @xmath40 ,",
    "the cross section is dominated by the direct part ( a - c ) . in this case , the photons couple directly to the quarks , and the process is therefore not dependent on the quark and gluon content in the photon .",
    "hence , the lowest , or zeroth , order process ( a ) can be calculated in pure qed , while first order corrections , including real ( b ) and virtual ( c ) gluon radiation , also depend on the qcd coupling constant .",
    "these corrections have been calculated in @xcite and were found to contribute 30@xmath41 of the cross section in the direct case .",
    "it has also been shown that the direct part alone ( including corrections ) can not reproduce the measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quark production in @xmath6 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 collisions .    in the single resolved case ( d - f ) , one of the photons splits up in a flux of quarks and gluons , where one of these gluons fuse with the other photon .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections are shown in ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "since this process depends on the quark and gluon distribution in the photon , it can not be calculated using perturbative qcd , but must be treated phenomenologically .",
    "the direct and single resolved processes are predicted to give equal contributions to the cross section at @xmath44  gev @xcite . in ( g ) and ( h ) is shown the double resolved case , where both photons split up and create a heavy quark pair .",
    "this process gives a smaller contribution than the direct and single resolved processes , since it depends on @xmath45 , but it becomes increasingly important with increasing energy .    in @xmath6 reactions",
    "there are additional contributions to heavy quark production , which have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the most important contribution comes from initial or final state radiation of a @xmath46 , which decays into a heavy quark pair .",
    "the cross section of other processes discussed in @xcite are typically several orders of magnitude smaller at linear collider energies .",
    "only the diagrams shown in figure  [ prodmech]a , d , e and g have been taken into account in this analysis .",
    "the processes in figure  [ prodmech ] are all of zeroth , first or second order in the strong coupling @xmath47 , and the matrix elements have all been calculated using perturbative qcd . however , in high energy collisions it is possible to have many gluon emissions , making the zeroth , first and even second order calculations insufficient to decribe the data . due to the self coupling of the gluons ,",
    "the complexity of the processes increases rapidly with increasing order , making perturbative calculations very difficult .",
    "instead one uses evolution equations to generate the higher order emissions .",
    "these equations describe , under certain approximations , how a mother parton is split into two daughter partons , one of which is emitted whereas the other continues as a propagator parton .",
    "the daughter propagator parton is then split into two daughters and so on .",
    "this creates a parton ladder , as illustrated in figure  [ ladder ] .",
    "the general structure of an evolution equation is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the parton density functions for the mother and daughter propagator gluons , @xmath51 is the input gluon density function and @xmath52 is the splitting kernel describing the probability that the parton @xmath13 is split into two partons @xmath21 and @xmath53 . in the following discussion ,",
    "the evolution starts at the bottom in figure  [ ladder ] and continues towards the quark box .",
    "the possible splittings are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "there are a number of different evolution equations , each one taking different parts of the full calculation into account and evolving the density functions in different variables .",
    "a short presentation of three different approaches follows , where the first is valid for large @xmath15 , the second is valid for small @xmath11 and moderate @xmath15 , and the third is valid for both these regions .",
    "the latter is of special importance for this paper .",
    "the dglap  @xcite evolution equation is of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the density of partons carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 probed at a scale @xmath59 , and @xmath60 describes the probability that a parton @xmath13 is split into two partons @xmath21 and @xmath53 with a fraction @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the original parton momentum , respectively .",
    "the probability that a gluon splits into two gluons is given by @xmath63 where the terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 are called the singular terms , since they give infinite contributions when @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the equation ( [ dglap ] ) thus describes the probability change of finding a parton of type @xmath21 with momentum fraction @xmath11 as we increase the scale @xmath59 . in the dglap formalism",
    ", the gluon chain in figure  [ ladder ] is assumed to be strongly ordered in virtuality @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the four momentum of parton @xmath13 .",
    "this means that in each splitting @xmath70 one can approximate @xmath71 compared to @xmath72 , and since @xmath73 these partons are considered to be massless ( or on - shell ) .",
    "it can be shown that the ordering in virtuality implies that also the transverse momentum of the propagator partons are strongly ordered ( at small @xmath74 ) according to @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "hence , in each splitting one can approximate @xmath77 , which means that the dglap approach is a collinear approximation ( which is obvious since there is no @xmath7-dependence in ( [ dglap ] ) )",
    ". it can be shown , that using the dglap evolution is equivalent to resum terms of the form @xmath78 in the expansion of the cross section .",
    "hence , the dglap approximation is only valid at large @xmath59 where these terms will dominate .",
    "the bfkl  @xcite evolution equation resums the terms @xmath79 in the expansion , and is thus only valid at small @xmath11 .",
    "it is of the form @xmath80 here , the function @xmath81 is the splitting kernel equivalent to @xmath82 in ( [ dglap ] ) .",
    "the evolution is made in increasing @xmath83 , since @xmath84 has been assumed .",
    "this implies that the emitted gluons will take a large fraction of the propagator momentum . however , there is no ordering in @xmath85 or @xmath86 , so the collinear approximation can not be used , and the incoming partons of the matrix elements must be taken off - shell ( the particles can have a virtual mass ) . another important consequence of bfkl is that unintegrated parton densities must be used in ( [ bfkl ] ) , i.e. they must depend on @xmath7 .",
    "the ccfm @xcite evolution equation is valid both at large and small @xmath11 , since it resums terms of both the form @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this means that at large @xmath11 the ccfm evolution will be dglap - like , and at small @xmath11 it will be bfkl - like .",
    "the ccfm evolution includes angular ordering in the initial state cascade , which means that the emission angles of the partons with respect to the propagator increases as one moves towards the quark box , @xmath89 where the maximum allowed angle @xmath90 is set by the hard quark box , @xmath91 this is written in the sudakov variables , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the four momenta of the produced heavy quarks and the incoming particles , respectively ( see figure  [ ladder ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the positive and negative light - cone momentum fractions of the heavy quark pair , and @xmath98 is the sum of the transverse momentum vectors of the heavy quark pair .",
    "the momenta of the emitted gluons can be written similary , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the momentum fraction of the emitted gluon , @xmath101 is the transverse momentum of the gluon , and @xmath102 is , as usual , the squared center of mass energy . here",
    ", we have assumed that all particles are massless .",
    "the ccfm equation is written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the rescaled transverse momenta of the emitted gluons and @xmath105 . in this formalism , ( [ angord ] )",
    "becomes @xmath106 when @xmath66 we have @xmath107 , i.e. ordering in rescaled transverse momentum , which means that the evolution is dglap - like . in the limit @xmath67",
    "the angular ordering gives no restrictions on the rescaled transverse momentum .",
    "also , ( [ bfkl2 ] ) holds because of the definition of @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the evolution is bfkl - like .",
    "the sudakov form factor @xmath108 describes the probability that there are no emissions from the starting scale @xmath109 to the maximum rescaled transverse momentum @xmath110 . the ccfm splitting function @xmath111 is defined as @xmath112 which is somewhat different than the dglap splitting function ( [ dglapsplitting ] ) .",
    "first of all , the ccfm splitting function only includes the singular parts of the dglap splitting function .",
    "the other difference is that there is one additional function @xmath113 , called the non - sudakov form factor , in ( [ ccfmsplitting ] ) .",
    "the non - sudakov form factor originates from the fact that , in ccfm and bfkl , all virtual corrections in the gluon vertex are automatically taken into account , see figure  [ regge ] .",
    "this is called the reggeization of the gluon vertex .",
    "as was already mentioned , higher order processes are very difficult to calculate using perturbative qcd . moreover , it is not quarks that are detected in the experiments , but hadrons .",
    "the transition from parton level ( figure  [ prodmech ] , for example ) to hadron level takes place over long distances where @xmath47 is large .",
    "hence , perturbation theory is not valid here . to overcome this problem , monte",
    "carlo ( mc ) generators are used . for each event , these programs generate all the particles , their four - momenta and all the kinematic variables according to certain theoretical prescriptions .",
    "the higher order gluon emissions are simulated by evolving the parton ladder according to some evolution equation ( dglap , bfkl , ccfm etc . ) , and the transitions to hadron level can also be implemented via hadronization models .",
    "the monte carlo generator cascade  @xcite is based on the ccfm evolution equation and thus uses unintegrated parton desities and off - shell matrix elements . for technical reasons ,",
    "a backward evolution is used , where first the hard scattering is generated and then the initial state cascade ( the gluon ladder ) is evolved from the quark box to the incoming particles . in this evolution only gluon emissions are treated , that is , only the splitting @xmath114 is considered . cascade also performs the hadronization , using the lund string model in jetset / pythia  @xcite .",
    "the evolution machinery was first tested using the one - loop ( dglap - like ) evolution for the proton and the photon .",
    "then , the unintegrated gluon density for the photon was obtained using the full ccfm evolution .",
    "the uncertainties in the evolution are discussed in section  [ unc1 ] .",
    "since the distributions obtained with the ccfm evolution were compared with the derivative of standard gluon density functions , taken from  @xcite , a short discussion of the differentiation method will be given first .",
    "alternative methods to calculate the unintegrated gluon density can be found in @xcite .",
    "two numerical differentiation methods were tested : dderiv  @xcite and dfridr  @xcite , which are based on rombergs principle of sequence extrapolation and richardson s deferred approach to the limit , respectively .",
    "the first test was to differentiate the simple function @xmath115 with respect to @xmath11 . here",
    ", both methods gave good results , but only after adjusting a parameter in dderiv .",
    "a second test was to differentiate the grv  @xcite density function with respect to the scale @xmath59 , then to integrate over @xmath86 and compare the results with the original grv distribution .",
    "this was done because we will later use equation ( [ pdf2 ] ) which relates the unintegrated parton density function @xmath36 to the integrated one @xmath116 .",
    "the adaptive gaussian method taken from  @xcite was used for the integration . as seen in figure  [ deriv2 ] , the dfridr routine reproduced the distribution succesfully , except in the high @xmath11 region which will be discussed later . however , with the same value of the parameter as used above , the dderiv approach gave unacceptable results , and only after changing this parameter again the obtained distribution ( which is shown in the figure ) started to resemble the original one .",
    "because of this poor reproduction of the input distribution , and its sensitivity to the choice of parameter , we decided to use dfridr instead of dderiv .",
    "the deviations from the original distribution at high @xmath11 is due to the fact that the function  ( [ pdf2 ] ) becomes negative in this region .",
    "this is because of the scaling violation : as the scale @xmath15 increases , smaller distances are resolved and as a consequence we resolve more gluons with small @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath117 ) and less gluons with high @xmath11 . in figure  [ deriv3 ] is shown how the point , where the derivative becomes negative , changes with @xmath118 .",
    "the smallest @xmath11-value for this point is obtained with @xmath119  gev , where @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath36 is interpreted as a probability , the method becomes invalid at such high @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the unintegrated gluon density was made using the ccfm equation in a forward evolution procedure based on the monte carlo technique as described in  @xcite .",
    "an initial gluon distribution is chosen as well as a starting scale @xmath121 and a rescaled transverse momentum @xmath122 , which is related to the emission angle ( see equations ( [ emang1 ] ) and ( [ emang2 ] ) ) , for the first emitted gluon .",
    "the default values @xmath123  gev was obtained by a fit to the proton structure function  @xcite .",
    "the evolution then starts with @xmath124 , and @xmath125 chosen from a gaussian distribution around @xmath121 to simulate a fermi motion of the partons .",
    "@xmath126 is chosen from the initial gluon distribution using the monte carlo method .",
    "the branching is then repeated until the next emitted gluon would have a higher @xmath127 than @xmath128 . this is repeated @xmath129 times for each of the 50 different maximum @xmath130 chosen from @xmath131  gev in steps of @xmath132 , thus giving a distribution @xmath133 in a @xmath134 grid of @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath132 . for values between the gridpoints",
    "the method of linear interpolation is used . with the unintegrated parton distribution avaliable",
    ", a backward evolution scheme can be used for the simulation of the parton emissions .      to make sure that the evolution procedure is working ,",
    "the evolution was first made for the proton with a grv input distribution ( using the default values @xmath137  gev ) and using the one - loop approximation  @xcite , which means that the ccfm evolution is reduced to the dglap evolution , with the difference that the ccfm one - loop evolution still treats the full kinematics , i.e. it takes the transverse momentum @xmath7 into account .",
    "this is done by putting @xmath138 in the splitting function ( [ ccfmsplitting ] ) and reducing the condition ( [ qcond ] ) to ordering in transverse momentum ( [ dglapkt ] ) .",
    "the obtained distribution @xmath139 was then integrated over @xmath86 , @xmath140 and compared to the original grv distribution at different scales , see figure  [ protondglap ] .",
    "the small differences are due to the fact that the splitting function only contains the singular parts , and that only the splitting @xmath114 is considered .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions are still in good agreement which indicates that the evolution machinery is working .",
    "the situation for the photon is a bit different , since the structure function , in addition to the hadronic component , now also consists of a pointlike component which reflects the splitting of the photon into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "also , there are no sum rules equivalent to those in the proton case that constrain the quark distributions in the photon .",
    "however , these differences do not matter , since we only use the gluon distribution and the gluon splitting @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ photondglap ] shows the evolved distribution for the photon , using the same parameters as in the proton case and the grv as input distribution , compared to the input distribution at different scales .",
    "the one - loop evolved and the grv distributions show a similar behaviour , although the one - loop evolved distribution is a bit steeper at large scales .",
    "it is not surprising that the one - loop evolution does not give equally good agreement in the proton and the photon case , since the same parameters have been used in both one - loop evolutions , while different techniques and starting scales for the proton and the photon were used to obtain the original grv distributions .    from the above",
    "we conclude that the one - loop evolution is able to reproduce the input distributions reasonably well , and hence that the evolution machinery is working for the ccfm one - loop case .",
    "a similar test can not be done for the full ccfm evolution , since the obtained distributions should be different from the ones obtained with ccfm one - loop evolution .",
    "however , it has already been shown @xcite that the ccfm evolution is working for the proton , in the sense that it can explain data , for example @xmath8 production at the tevatron , which could not be explained with other methods .",
    "since the only difference between the photon and proton evolution is the starting distribution , it can be assumed that the ccfm evolution will work also for the photon .      after making sure that the parton evolution scheme gives consistent results , the unintegrated gluon density for the photon",
    "was evolved using the full ccfm evolution procedure .",
    "the obtained distributions integrated over @xmath86 are compared in figure  [ photonccfm ] to the grv distribution , which was used as input distribution .",
    "one of the more obvious differences is that the ccfm evolved distribution is much higher than the original grv .",
    "this is due to differences in the definition of the integrated gluon density ; one can either integrate over @xmath141 or over @xmath142 .",
    "the difference is a factor @xmath143 , which explains the main part of the normalization difference .",
    "we can also note that the ccfm evolved distribution is less steep than the original grv .",
    "this is a consequence of that the non - sudakov form factor @xmath144 when @xmath67 and thereby screens the @xmath65 factor in the splitting function .",
    "this results in a lower splitting probability compared to the dglap case ( where @xmath138 ) which becomes visible in the small @xmath11 ( small @xmath74 ) region where the factor @xmath65 dominates the splitting function .    in figure  [ photonccfmun ]",
    "is shown the unintegrated distribution as a function of @xmath11 for different values of @xmath7 , and as a function of @xmath86 for different values of @xmath11 , compared to the derivative of grv . here ,",
    "@xmath145  gev .",
    "also in figure  [ photonccfmun]a we see that the ccfm distribution in general is higher ( except at very high @xmath7 ) and we can also see the non - sudakov supression at small @xmath11",
    ". we should also remember that the derivative method becomes invalid at high @xmath11 because @xmath146 becomes negative .",
    "this explains the big difference between the ccfm evolved distribution and the grv at @xmath119 gev , because the derivative becomes negative already at @xmath147 ( see figure  [ deriv3 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ photonccfmun]b one can see the typical exponential @xmath7-dependence of the derivative of grv .",
    "since the grv distribution is only defined for @xmath148 gev@xmath149 , it is replaced with @xmath150 for @xmath151 gev@xmath149 @xcite .",
    "we can also note that the probability for the gluons to have a @xmath152 gev@xmath149 in the ccfm approach is significant , which would not be possible using dglap .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath86-ordering in the dglap evolution , where @xmath86 is always less than @xmath15 , see ( [ dglapkt ] ) , and the non - ordering in @xmath86 in the ccfm evolution , where the gluons can have any kinematically allowed value of @xmath86 .      in the evolution of the unintegrated gluon distributions above",
    ", the grv density was used as input distribution , with @xmath123  gev given from a fit to the parton density of the proton @xcite .",
    "a natural question is how sensitive the results are to the selected starting distribution and the parameters chosen .",
    "therefore , the evolution was made also with the sas @xcite parton distribution as input ( and keeping @xmath137  gev ) , and also with the grv parametrization as input but with @xmath153  gev and @xmath154  gev , @xmath153  gev and @xmath155  gev , and @xmath156  gev and @xmath157  gev .",
    "the various distributions obtained are compared to the previous ones in figure  [ uncertain ] and  [ uncertain_un ] .",
    "when comparing the integrated distributions ( figure  [ uncertain ] ) we see that there is only a weak dependence on the starting value @xmath122 , such that the distribution becomes somewhat flatter at large @xmath122 .",
    "this can be understood , since a larger starting angle would mean that it takes less emissions to reach the maximum value ( since there is angular ordering ) , and less emissions would mean that the gluon entering the matrix element ( gluon @xmath158 in figure  [ ladder ] ) would have a larger longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 .",
    "a change in @xmath121 makes a significant difference , where a smaller @xmath121 gives a distribution which is lower at small @xmath11 .",
    "one can also see that the evolution depends on the choice of input distribution , where the main features of the input distribution remains after the evolution , see also figure  [ originalpdf ] .    also when comparing the unintegrated gluon densities in figure  [ uncertain_un ] , we see that the dependence on @xmath122 is small while changing @xmath121 makes a significant difference , especially in the region @xmath159 .",
    "this is probably due to details in the evolution : in order to avoid soft emissions a cut - off scale @xmath121 is defined .",
    "thus if the propagator gluon has @xmath160 a real emission is allowed , but it is not if @xmath161 . since there is no ordering in @xmath7 in the ccfm evolution any propagator gluon along the evolution chain might get @xmath161 after a real emission . in that case ,",
    "the evolution of the propagator is continued until @xmath160 and a real emission is allowed .",
    "the obtained unintegrated gluon density was used as an input to the mc generator cascade to calculate heavy quark cross sections in @xmath6 collisions , which are compared to lep data . also , predictions for heavy quark cross sections in @xmath6 and @xmath1 collisions at tesla energies are given .",
    "the @xmath6 cross sections can be calculated using the relation @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the photon flux in the electron , @xmath164 is the center of mass energy in the @xmath9 system , @xmath165 is the virtuality of photon @xmath13 and @xmath166 is the cross section for the subprocess @xmath167 .",
    "the direct and single resolved cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 quark production in @xmath6 collisions were calculated with cascade and compared with the results in @xcite . since the direct cross section is independent of the gluon content in the photon , and hence independent of evolution equations , these cross sections should agree . in heavy flavour production ,",
    "cascade uses off - shell matrix elements as calculated in  @xcite .",
    "errors were found in  @xcite ( eq .",
    "b16 ) where a factor @xmath168 was missing in the direct cross section ( @xmath169 being the color factor and @xmath170 being the em charge of the produced quarks ) . with these factors taken into account ,",
    "the direct cross sections from cascade and from leading and next - to - leading order calculations @xcite were in good agreement , see table  [ crosstest ] . for the single resolved case ,",
    "the dglap evolution was used with the gluon density according to grv to describe the photon structure and with cuts and parameters as in @xcite .",
    "as seen , also these cross sections where in good agreement .",
    "the aim of this comparison is just to show that the basic machinery for cross section calculations in cascade is working .",
    ".__direct and single resolved charm and beauty cross sections calculated with cascade and compared to leading and next - to - leading order ( in parenthesis ) calculations in @xcite ( drees ) . here , @xmath171 , @xmath172  gev , @xmath173  gev and @xmath174  gev .",
    "in cascade , the scale factor 0.5 was used to obtain the correct scale . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in figure  [ eexsec ] are shown the obtained cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 quark production in @xmath6 collisions calculated with the @xmath7-factorization approach , using off - shell me and a ccfm unintegrated gluon density evolved from a starting distribution given by grv , compared to the collinear ( dglap ) predictions and data @xcite . here ,",
    "the masses @xmath175  gev and @xmath176  gev were used for the ccfm cross sections , while @xmath173  gev and @xmath177  gev were used for the cross sections calculated with dglap .",
    "this variation of the quark masses gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the calculation .",
    "one can see that the @xmath7-factorization approach describes the charm data reasonably well and that it gives larger cross sections compared to the collinear method .",
    "one can also see that the choice of mass makes a significant difference , such that a smaller mass gives a larger cross section .",
    "nevertheless , the cross sections obtained with @xmath178  gev@xmath179  gev all lie within the experimental uncertainties .    the cross sections for @xmath8 production , on the other hand , are not well described . however , in the ccfm approach , one has to determine carefully the normalization of the cross sections .",
    "the reason for this is that the normalization of the unintegrated gluon density does not have to be the same as for the standard gluon densities generated according to the collinear scheme , since the integration is made over different regions ( i.e. the integral over @xmath180 is from @xmath181 to @xmath15 in the collinear approach , whereas in the ccfm formalism the integral is over all kinematically allowed @xmath86 ) and the matrix elements are different .",
    "this normalization factor has to be applied to the single and double resolved cross sections , but not to the direct cross section since it is independent of the gluon density .",
    "the contribution of the direct and resolved cross sections are shown in figure  [ xsecdirres ] .",
    "as seen , the differences between ccfm and dglap are due to differences in the resolved contributions of the cross sections .",
    "normalizing the ccfm cross section to the charm data at @xmath182  gev for @xmath177  gev , by applying a normalization factor @xmath183 to the single and double resolved cross sections , gives a much steeper behaviour of the total cross section , as seen in figure  [ xsecnorm ] .",
    "however , the ccfm predictions are still in good agreement with the charm data at @xmath184  gev .",
    "the normalization also improves the situation for the @xmath8 cross section , where our calculations give @xmath185  pb at @xmath182  gev .",
    "this can be compared to standard collinear nlo predictions which give @xmath186  pb @xcite and results based on  @xcite , giving @xmath187  pb using a kmr gluon density , and @xmath188  pb using a gbw gluon density at the same energy .",
    "the ccfm cross sections are of the same order but a bit larger than nlo standard calculations , which has also been observed in @xmath42 collisions at hera .",
    "thus , the improvement is not sufficient fully to describe the @xmath8 data , which is still a factor 2 - 3 above predictions .",
    "the ccfm predictions for heavy quark production in @xmath6 collisions at tesla energies are shown in figure  [ xsec2norm ] . here ,",
    "the normalization factor @xmath183 has been applied for the resolved cross sections . with a charm mass of @xmath177",
    "gev the ccfm predictions at @xmath189  gev are    @xmath190  pb .    for beauty , the predictions are    @xmath191  pb    using a beauty mass of @xmath173  gev .",
    "figure  [ xsecgam ] shows the charm and beauty cross sections in @xmath9 collisions at tesla energies calculated using the ccfm evolution .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath183 has been applied to the resolved contributions . at @xmath189  gev ,",
    "the predicted cross sections are    @xmath192  nb    for charm and    @xmath193  nb    for beauty . also here",
    ", the masses @xmath177  gev and @xmath173  gev were used .",
    "figure  [ xsecgam ] also shows the resolved contributions of the cross sections .",
    "as seen , the single and double resolved cross sections dominate the total cross section at these energies .",
    "the reason for this is that the direct contribution , in contrast to the resolved ones , decreases with energy , and is only about 1@xmath41 of the total cross section at @xmath194  gev .",
    "the cross section for heavy quark production depends on the unintegrated gluon density and the partonic cross section .",
    "these in turn depend on a few parameters which are not fixed by theory but have to be determined from fits to experimental data , and therefore give rise to some uncertainties in the calculations .",
    "these uncertainties are discussed below and shown in figure  [ xsecvar ] for @xmath6 collisions .    *",
    "the ccfm evolution * of the unintegrated gluon density is sensitive to the input gluon density , the starting scale @xmath121 and the starting value for the rescaled transverse momentum @xmath122 .",
    "the default values in this analysis are @xmath123  gev , obtained from a fit to the parton distribution in the proton @xcite , with a grv input distribution .",
    "the gluon densities obtained with @xmath156  gev and @xmath157  gev , and sas input distribution with @xmath123  gev showed the largest differences compared to the gluon density obtained with the default option ( see figure  [ uncertain ] ) .",
    "therefore , the cross sections were calculated also with these gluon densities to get an estimate of the error .    *",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath47 * is , despite its name , not a constant , but varies with the energy scale @xmath195 , according to ( in a first approximation ) @xmath196 here , @xmath197 is the number of quark flavours with mass less than the energy scale @xmath195 , and @xmath198 is a constant which has to be determined by experiments .",
    "the value of @xmath198 also depends on the order that the process is calculated at . however , it is not clear how to compare the value of @xmath198 used in the ccfm approach with the one used in nlo dglap , since the first order in the ccfm approach includes some second order diagrams in the dglap approach .",
    "the default value was chosen to be @xmath199  gev , which was also used in the evolution of the unintegrated gluon density , but @xmath200  gev ( used in  @xcite ) was also tested . *",
    "the energy scale @xmath195 * is of the order of the typical momentum transfer , but the exact choice of scale should be such that the higher order contributions in the perturbative expansion of the cross section are minimal .",
    "the standard choice is @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath101 is the transverse momentum of the heavy quarks in the center of mass frame of the heavy quark system . to show the effect of the choice of @xmath195 , the scale @xmath203",
    "is also used here as a comparison .",
    "* the quark masses . * since the quarks are always confined in colorless hadrons , their masses can not be measured directly . instead , the masses must be extracted from hadron properties . however ,",
    "this can be done in various ways depending on the exact definition of the quark masses , and different methods lead to slightly different results .",
    "therefore , the heavy quark masses are varied such that @xmath204  gev @xmath205  gev and @xmath178  gev @xmath206  gev .",
    "this variation of the quark masses gives the largest uncertainty , and can therefore be used as an estimate of the total uncertainty , as seen in figure  [ xsec2norm ] , for example .",
    "in figure  [ xsecvar ] is shown the cross sections for heavy quark production in @xmath6 collisions , calculated with different choices of @xmath198 , @xmath15 and unintegrated gluon densities .",
    "one can see that a change in @xmath198 from @xmath207  gev to @xmath208  gev gives the largest variation of the cross sections , while changing @xmath15 and the gluon density has a smaller effect .",
    "however , all these uncertainties are small compared to a change in the quark masses , see figure  [ eexsec ] .",
    "the unintegrated gluon density for the photon was obtained with the full ccfm evolution for the first time .",
    "the ccfm evolved gluon density for the photon was used as input in the mc generator cascade , and cross sections for heavy quark production in @xmath6 collisions were calculated and compared to lep data .",
    "also , predictions for charm and beauty production in @xmath6 and @xmath9 collisions at tesla energies are given .",
    "in @xmath6 collisions , the obtained cross sections were somewhat larger than nlo dglap predictions , but in good agreement with the charm data from lep .",
    "the ccfm approach made a slight improvement compared to the standard collinear approach for the beauty cross sections .",
    "however , the improvement did not fully account for the discrepancy to the @xmath8 data .",
