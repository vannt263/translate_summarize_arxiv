    "the structural graph similarity or distance of graphs has been attracting attention of researchers from many different fields , such as mathematics , social network analysis , biology or chemistry .",
    "the two main concepts which have been explored are exact ( based on isomorphic relations and computationally demanding , see @xcite and references therein ) and inexact graph matching ( one example here is graph edit distance , see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with the later concept , and study interrelations of graph distance measures by means of inequalities .",
    "graph distance measure is a mapping @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is any set of graphs @xcite",
    ".    given two graphs with @xmath2 vertices , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the edit distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 , is the minimum cost caused by the number of edge additions and/or deletions that are needed transform @xmath3 into @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath6 has been introduced by bunke @xcite .",
    "a topological index @xcite is a type of a molecular descriptor that is calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound , and usually represents numerical graph invariant @xmath7 .",
    "some novel class of graph distance measures based on topological indices have been introduced by dehmer et al . @xcite .",
    "the same authors continued research from @xcite and proved various inequalities and studied comparative graph measures based on the well - known wiener index , graph energy and randi ' c index . for more results on graph entropy measures",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we focus on the graph distance measure introduced in @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an arbitrary real number and @xmath7 and @xmath10 are certain graph invariants . note that @xmath11 is actually is a distance measure for real numbers , and for more mathematical properties see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be a connected graph on @xmath2 vertices .",
    "the distance between the vertices @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the wiener index is one of the oldest distance - based topological indexes @xcite , and defined as the sum of all distances between any two vertices of a graph : @xmath17 randi ' c index @xcite is suitable for measuring the extent of branching of chemical graphs , and is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a degree of the vertex @xmath14 .",
    "denote by @xmath20 the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of @xmath15 .",
    "the energy of a graph is introduced by gutman @xcite equals to @xmath21 while the distance measure based on shannon s entropy @xcite is defined as @xmath22    by setting @xmath23 in the shannon entropy formula , we can also obtain the new entropy based on the degree powers @xcite , denoted by @xmath24 : @xmath25    the following three conjectures are proposed in the same paper of dehmer et al .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be any two trees with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "then , it holds @xmath28    let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be any two trees with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "then , it holds @xmath29    let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be any two trees with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "then , it holds @xmath30    in this note , we are going to construct a family of pairs of trees that do not satisfy conjecture 1 and 3 , and then disprove conjecture 2 by providing specific examples of equienergetic trees from the literature .",
    "the authors from @xcite verified the conjectures on all trees with small number of vertices and these counterexamples have more than 12 vertices . in section 4",
    ", we are going to refine some results on the graph edit distance and shannon entropy from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "by definition , the reverse inequality @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath32 using the fact that @xmath33 is a strictly increasing function , it is further equivalent to @xmath34 we are going to construct a family of tree pairs @xmath35 on @xmath2 vertices that have the same wiener index and different randi ' c index , and thus left side of the above inequality will be 0 .",
    "more examples of non - isomorphic trees having equal wiener index are introduced by rada in  @xcite .     and @xmath27 with equal wiener index .",
    "]    in figure 1 , we can attach arbitrary trees @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the vertices @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and it is an easy exercise to verify that these trees are non - isomorphic and have the same wiener index ( the sum of all distances from the vertex @xmath38 to the vertices not in @xmath36 and @xmath37 is constant in both trees and equals 26 ) .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "randi ' c index is a local topological index , and the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 depends only on the edge weights around vertices @xmath13 , @xmath39 , @xmath14 and @xmath38 . by direct computation , it follows @xmath44    as @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be arbitrary integer numbers , the above difference is almost never equal to zero - and this completes the counterexample construction for conjecture  1 .    for conjecture 3 , we need to construct a family of pairs of trees that satisfy @xmath47 for any @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a tree composed of caterpillar having @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 and @xmath38 leaves attached to any tree @xmath26 .",
    "then by definition it holds @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the remainder of the summation for the randi ' c index of the subtree @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in the pairs of quadruples @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that @xmath55    the main trick for the exhaustive search is to fix @xmath56 and search among perfect squares , as that will make the calculation easier . after running a simple code for iterating through all triples less than 100 , we get multiple examples of pairs of trees with equal randi ' c index ( see figure 2 ) : @xmath57 or @xmath58     and @xmath27 with equal randi ' c index . ]    for these graph pairs , we obviously have @xmath59 , given that the degree sequences are different . by definition we get @xmath60 and @xmath59 is equivalent to @xmath61    the above approadh can be easily generalized to @xmath62 for an arbitrary @xmath48 .",
    "the same idea can be applied to conjecture 2 , which is equivalent to @xmath63    for trees with the same spectra it obviously holds that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "here we can construct non - cospectral trees with the same energy and non - zero difference of their @xmath66 invariants .",
    "there are many examples of non - cospectral equienergetic trees in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and by direct verification for some of them we can conclude that @xmath67 .",
    "for the first pair of trees defined in @xcite , it can be directly computed that @xmath68 ( by ignoring zero eigenvalues ) .",
    "note that until now no general method for construction of such trees is known .",
    "this refutes conjecture  2 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a probability vector , namely @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the shannon s entropy of @xmath72 has been defined by @xmath73 we denote by @xmath74 the graph distance measure of @xmath75 .",
    "the authors in @xcite proved the following result :    let @xmath15 and @xmath76 be two graphs with the same vertex set . denote by @xmath77 and @xmath78 be the probability vectors of @xmath15 and @xmath76 , respectively . if @xmath79 for each @xmath80 , then we infer @xmath81 where @xmath82    since the sum of the coordinates of the probability vectors @xmath72 and @xmath83 is equal to 1 and @xmath79 we easily conclude that @xmath84 and therefore @xmath85 .",
    "this finally means that the above result needs to be reformulated by dropping the condition for probability vectors .",
    "the authors from @xcite focused on graphs whose distance can be obtained by performing only one graph edit operation , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "this is used to determine which measure is the powerful and most useful one .",
    "they presented such results on randi ' c index and graph energy , but did not obtain similar bounds for the wiener index .",
    "the authors are grateful to maja kabiljo for her remarks and discussions that helped to improve the article .",
    "we are also sincerely thankful to an anonymous referee for the constructive remarks and references ."
