    "magnetic fields are believed to play a crucial role in the physics of jets and outflows in young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "the models presently proposed to explain the outflow engine in low mass ysos rely on a magneto - centrifugally driven mechanism ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "whether the magnetic field also defines the launching mechanism and properties of jets in high mass ysos is still unclear .",
    "some observational findings suggest that the formation of intermediate- to high - mass stars also proceeds via disk accretion as in its low - mass counterparts , powering similarly highly collimated outflows @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the interstellar ( is ) magnetic field can be relevant in the maintenance of jets , as is suggested by the simulations of @xcite . from an observational perspective ,",
    "@xcite , based on a sample of classical t tauri stars , suggested that the objects with bright and/or long jets might have their disk axes parallel to the interstellar magnetic field .    and are very luminous herbig - haro ( hh ) objects discovered by @xcite , who presented optical imaging and spectroscopy of the sources .",
    "they are located in eastern carina in the southwest portion of the dark cloud @xcite near the bright - rimmed hii region bbw 47 @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered infrared cluster # 59 from @xcite is also coincident with the hh pair .",
    "a more complete description of the optical objects in this region is presented by @xcite .",
    "the estimated distance to the optical / infrared objects in this region is in the 2.7  2.9 kpc range .",
    "dcld290.4 + 01.9 , which has a size of 28@xmath2 12 , is included in the co(j=1 - 0 ) catalogue of @xcite .",
    "this line has a well defined gaussian shape with a fwhm of 1.0  km  s@xmath3  and @xmath4 = -19.8 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "infrared observation were recently used to detect and study the physical properties of the @xmath5 jet @xcite .",
    "his @xmath5 and [ fe ii ] continuum - subtracted narrow band images nicely trace the line emission morphology in the outflow .",
    "a co molecular outflow is also present @xcite .",
    "@xcite present imaging circular polarimetry of hh135/hh136  which suggests a helical magnetic field in the outflow .",
    "the emission knots of hh135  and hh136  are distributed in a practically straight line @xcite .",
    "this could be interpreted as an evidence for two jets with a common origin . however , both jets are dominated by blue - shifted components , which has led @xcite to propose that each hh object had a different source .",
    "subsequent infrared polarimetry of the extended emission associated with the hh objects has shown that they have a common illuminating source , namely @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction of these two observations can be avoided by the scenario proposed by @xcite . in this picture , the hh136  jet is deflected by a molecular cloud , changing from a red - shifted jet near the iras source to a blue - shifted one in its extremity ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "iras11101@xmath15829  is a luminous ( @xmath6 ) yso @xcite associated with molecular masers of different species @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that it is a herbig ae / be stars encircled by a dust disk . in particular , the presence of a 6.7ghz methanol maser points to a high - mass yso @xcite .",
    "the masers profiles have @xmath4 in the range -24 to -21 km  s@xmath3 , indicating a kinematic distance of approximately 3 kpc .",
    "this velocity is similar to that of the dcld290.4 + 01.9 , which suggests that the iras source and the dark cloud are associated .",

    ". these data also indicate a total cloud mass of 230  m@xmath7 , consistent with the mass estimated by @xcite of 150  m@xmath7  using co observations .    in this work , we present a study of the magnetic field in the interstellar medium ( ism ) around the pair hh135/hh136  using polarimetric optical data .",
    "polarimetry of the optical nebula associated with the hh135/hh136  is also obtained .",
    "a brief discussion of the iras11101@xmath15829  and hh136 - 6 sources is presented . in section [ sec_obs ]",
    ", we describe the polarimetric data and their reduction .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in section [ sec - res ] . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "the observations have been done in 2005 february 12 with the 0.60-m boller & chivens telescope at the observatrio do pico dos dias , brazil , operated by the laboratrio nacional de astrofsica , brazil , using a ccd camera modified by the polarimetric module described in @xcite .",
    "the employed technique eliminates the sky polarization @xcite .",
    "the ccd array used was a site back - illuminated , @xmath8 pixels .",
    "the above telescope and instrumentation gives a field - of - view of 105 @xmath2 105 ( 1 pixel = 062 ) .",
    "the data have been taken with an @xmath9 filter .",
    "polarimetric standards stars @xcite have been observed in order to calibrate the system and estimate the instrumental polarization .",
    "the measured values of the unpolarized standard stars were consistent with zero within the errors .",
    "measurements using a glan filter were also performed to estimate the efficiency of the instrument .",
    "they indicate that no instrumental correction is needed .",
    "the reduction has been done using using the iraf facility .",
    "the images have been corrected for bias and flat - field .",
    "counts in the ordinary and extraordinary images of each object were used to calculate the polarization using the method described in @xcite .",
    "we have utilized the iraf package pccdpack @xcite in the polarimetric analysis .",
    "we obtained the polarimetry of around 1600 objects in the field - of - view .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in the following section .",
    "the ordinary and extraordinary images of the extended emission associated with hh135/hh136   did not overlap allowing image polarimetry to be performed .",
    "it has been done considering circular apertures of 2 pixels ( @xmath1012 ) radius centered in points distant from each other by 4 pixels ( @xmath1025 ) in each ccd direction .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec - res ] .",
    "in addition , we have performed differential photometry using as calibrators usno objects in the ] results and discussion ----------------------      the direction of the magnetic field component in the plane of the sky can be traced by the position angle of the optical polarization .",
    "it is valid if one assumes that the polarization originates from the dicroic absorption of the star light by non - spherical interstellar grains aligned by the superparamagnetic mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; a recent review on grain alignment can been found in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig_histo_all ] shows the number distribution of the position angle of polarization , @xmath11 , for objects with @xmath12 , which corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "we have also discarded objects that have positions superposed to the outflow . using these restrictions",
    ", we reduce our sample to 303 objects .",
    "the distribution is clearly bimodal with peaks at approximately 55  and 100 .",
    "therefore , we performed a two - gaussian fit which is also shown in figure [ fig_histo_all ] .",
    "the fitted parameters and errors for bins of 10  are shown in table [ tab - gauss ] ( lines 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the results are statistically the same for smaller or larger bin widths .",
    "an inspection of the data shows that these two populations have distinct spatial distributions and polarization magnitudes .",
    "this is illustrated in figures [ fig_small ] and [ fig_largep ] in which we have respectively plotted the results for objects with polarization modulus smaller and larger than @xmath14 ( an arbitrarily chosen number ) .",
    "the objects with small values of polarization tend to be distributed in regions where the extinction is less pronounced ( figure [ fig_small ] - left ) . in the right panel of figure [ fig_small ]",
    ", we show the histogram of the position angle of this sub - sample as well as a gaussian curve with the same mean and dispersion of that of figure [ fig_histo_all ] centered at  100 .",
    "the agreement indicates that the population responsible for this peak in figure [ fig_histo_all ] is well represented by polarization magnitudes smaller than 1.5% .",
    "the large vectors tend to be located in a strip running from the southwest to the northeast of the image which roughly corresponds to the dark cloud ( figure [ fig_largep ] - left ) .",
    "again , one of the gaussian curves in figure [ fig_histo_all ] fits well the distribution of position angles .",
    "our interpretation of the above results is that the population with smaller values of polarization corresponds to foreground objects in the line of sight to the hh pair , while the more polarized objects have their polarization produced by grains associated with dcld290.4 + 01.9 , hence tracing the magnetic field alignment in the star forming region itself . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have used the compilation of @xcite to verify the polarization behavior in a larger field - of - view .",
    "we selected the objects within a 5@xmath2 5  field centered at hh  135 and with @xmath15 ( 85 objects ) .",
    "the number distribution of the position angles and a gaussian fit are shown in figure [ fig_heiles ] .",
    "the gaussian parameters are presented in table [ tab - gauss ] ( fourth line ) . in spite of the larger dispersion ,",
    "the mean position angle of heiles objects compares well with that of our suggested foreground component .",
    "the mean polarization magnitude of heiles objects is 1% , which is also consistent with our data .",
    "these results corroborate the supposition that the population having a mean angle around 100  corresponds to the large scale , and probably foreground , ism .",
    "another way to constrain the origin of each population is to determine the behavior of the polarization with distance , which , however , can not be properly estimated with our data . from a statistical point of view , a faint object is generally farther than a bright one .",
    "so , an alternative , despite limited , approach is to check the polarization dependence with magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig_pol_mag ] shows that the polarization tends to increase with magnitude .",
    "this corroborates our hypothesis that the larger polarization values are associated with objects at larger distances .",
    "the above discussion gives us confidence that the small polarization component is associated with the foreground ism in the direction of the hh pair .",
    "consequently , we should subtract this component from the observations to obtain the is polarization produced by aligned dust _ in _ the star forming region . to estimate a value to the foreground component",
    "we have averaged the polarization of the objects with the observed polarization smaller than 1.5% .",
    "this totalizes 212 objects with a mean polarization of 0.59 @xmath16 0.36% @ 93.4  ( the quoted error is the standard deviation of the distribution ) .",
    "this value was subtracted from our sample of 303 objects .",
    "( we would like to note that all the arithmetics has been done using the stokes parameters q and u ) .",
    "the number distribution of @xmath11 for objects with @xmath15 is plotted in figure [ fig_histo_foreg ] .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian fit is shown in the second line of table [ tab - gauss ] .",
    "this distribution , which should represent the magnetic field orientation in the hh135/hh136  region , is similar to the uncorrected , but not the same .",
    "the mean position angle is at 419 @xmath16 12 .",
    "the direction of the interstellar magnetic field found above can be compared with the geometry of the young stellar object , in particular , with the outflow direction .",
    "the jet position angle ( from north to east - equatorial coordinates ) has been estimated using the line joining iras  11101@xmath15829 and a given line emitting knot .",
    "they are : hh135 , hh136/a - b - d - h .",
    "there are other knots , but whose emission occurs mainly in the continuum , so they could not trace the jet .",
    "the adopted position angle for hh136  is the average of its four knots .",
    "the resulting position angles are : @xmath17 for hh135 ; and @xmath18 for hh136 .",
    "therefore , the component of the interstellar magnetic field in the plane of sky ( @xmath1042 ) and the yso outflow are approximately parallel .",
    "an interstellar magnetic field aligned with the jet is the best configuration for the propagation of the outflow in the ism , as recently demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "these authors conducted two - dimensional numerical simulations of clumps ( which , in their models , represent time - dependent ejection from ysos ) propagating in a magnetized ism .",
    "they found that jets moving parallel to the ambient magnetic field can propagate to much longer distances when compared with those that propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "they claim that this could explain the correlation found by @xcite for classical t tauri stars ; namely , the bright and long jets tend to be parallel to the interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "the jet associated with hh135/hh136  has a projected size of approximately 0.5 pc and high luminosity , so in this object we could be seeing the effect of a parallel is magnetic field keeping the jet .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have found evidence of a helical magnetic field in the outflow of hh135/hh136  based on infrared circular polarization , which can concur to collimate the jet .",
    "the present evidences , however , can not state unambiguously which magnetic configuration is predominantly acting as the main large - scale collimating mechanism in this high - mass yso .",
    "the emission lines of @xmath5 and [ fe ii ] in hh135/hh136  indicate a fast , dissociative j - type shock @xcite .",
    "it is evidenced by the different space distributions of these emissions . in a j - type shock ,",
    "the transverse ( relative to the propagation direction ) magnetic field is small .",
    "so the magnetic field direction inferred from our large - scale measurements may be similar to that in the ism in which the shock propagates .",
    "however , we should again recall a possible helicoidal field in the outflow @xcite , which would produce a c - type shock or a j - type shock with precursors .",
    "more observations in order to constrain the detailed shock physical conditions - as , for instance , the @xmath5 v=0 transitions - may be helpful in disantangling the magnetic field geometry in the outflow region .",
    "we could also ask if the geometry of dcld290.4 + 01.9  has some correlation with the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig_large_scale ] shows a 05 @xmath2 05 dss2 red image centered at dcld290.4 + 01.9 .",
    "the lines represent the contour plot of the flux at 100  @xmath0 m from iras .",
    "hh135/hh136  can be seen in the lower right quadrant , northeast of the hii region bbw  47 .",
    "the denser portion of the cloud - as illustrated by the obscuration at optical wavelengths and dust emission at infrared - seems to be elongated in the northeast - southwest direction . if this is true , the interstellar magnetic field , the hh outflow , and the cloud elongation are all nearly parallel .",
    "this configuration is similar to what occurs in lynds  1641 @xcite .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky , @xmath19 , can be estimate using    @xmath20    where : @xmath21 is the mass density of the ism ; @xmath22 , the one - dimensional turbulent velocity ; and @xmath23 , the dispersion of the magnetic field direction .",
    "this expression was proposed by @xcite and relies on the equipartition of turbulent kinetic and magnetic energies and isotropy of the motions in the medium .",
    "the overall ideia behind this formula is still accepted @xcite , notwithstanding different effects could lead the above equation not to be the best estimate of the actual field : large fluctuations of the magnetic field amplitude ; acting of the nonmagnetic forces on the gas ; inhomogeneity of the interstellar material @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations of polarimetric maps of molecular clouds indicate that this formula overestimates the magnetic field by a factor 2 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath23 in the star formation region can be estimated by the standard deviation of the fitted gaussian to the number distribution of the position angle of the intrinsic polarization ( see second line of table [ tab - gauss ] ) .",
    "this number is , however , an overestimate of the dispersion of the magnetic field direction since it includes the observational error associated with the @xmath11 measurement . following the procedure suggested by @xcite , we obtain a @xmath23 value of 133 .",
    "the turbulent velocity was considered that of the dark cloud and measured by @xcite as 1  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "a total mass density of @xmath24 g @xmath25 has been estimated from the number density of @xmath5 presented in @xcite , which was based on cs(j=2 - 1 ) measurements near the iras source . considering a factor of 0.5 to equation ( [ eq_cf ] ) -",
    "as discussed above - we obtain an interstellar magnetic field strength of 90 @xmath0 g .",
    "however , we would like to note that this value should be interpreted as the order of magnitude of the field .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "on one hand , the observational values used in the magnetic field calculation have their own uncertanties .",
    "on the other hand , the values of the mass density , magnetic field dispersion , and turbulent velocity can be tracing different portions of the ism .",
    "@xcite obtained that a single estimation of @xmath19 with the above procedure can be in error by a factor of 7 .",
    "in addition , we would like to note that the above estimate of @xmath19 should be associated with the large scale ism around hh135/hh136 , not with the outflow region . this value is larger than that measured in the diffuse ism of a few @xmath0 g , but it is in the range obtained for star forming regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the alignment of outflows with magnetic fields in clouds cores through numerical simulations .",
    "they found that the outflow tends to be aligned with the large - scale ( @xmath26 5000 au ) magnetic field if the magnetic field _ in the core _ is larger than 80  @xmath0 g .",
    "our above estimate of 90  @xmath0 g may be interpreted as the strength in the dark cloud , i.e. , the initial magnetic field before the collapse ( the b@xmath27 of @xcite ) .",
    "so the enhanced magnetic field in the collapsing core that originated the yso has probably exceeded the limiting value of 80  @xmath0 g , making plausible that in this region the geometry of the magnetic field in the original cloud determined the direction of the yso outflow .",
    "figure [ fig_imagepol ] shows the imaging linear polarimetry of the emission nebula associated with hh135/hh136 .",
    "the background image is from our data : the object is seen twice because of the beam splitting produced by the calcite block .",
    "only measurements with @xmath28 are plotted .",
    "the vectors sizes show that the polarization can be as high as 30% .",
    "the position angles define a clear centro - symmetric pattern , typical of scattering , whose center has been calculated and coincides with knot hh  136-e ( following the denomination of @xcite ) . from north to south , this knot is the second bright source in our image .",
    "the centers calculated using the data over the hh  135 region or the hh  136 region are the same .",
    "hh  136-e is the brightest point in the r band image , having a magnitude of 14.37 mag .",
    "the knot b , the second brightest , has a magnitude of 14.78 mag , which corresponds to a flux 30% smaller than knot e. in both estimates we have used an aperture radius of 3 pixels (= 18 ) .",
    "our imaging r - band polarimetry indicates hh136-e as the illuminator center of the scattering pattern , so it is unequivocally associated with the region .",
    "previous k - band polarimetry of the same region @xcite shows also a centro - symmetric pattern , but whose center is coincident with iras  11101@xmath15829 .",
    "the dominant source in the infrared region is nirs  17 ( @xcite - see also figure 5 of @xcite ) , which is coincident with knot j. they suggested that the iras source is obscured from our view by an optically thick disk , which is evidenced by the `` polarization disk '' , but illuminates the associated nebula through the optically thinner pole .",
    "the optical depth of a dusty medium grows from infrared to optical wavelengths .",
    "therefore , in the r band , the disk around the iras source can be optically thick even at its pole , thus preventing any flux to escape .",
    "this could explain why iras11101@xmath15829  is not the source of the optical light being scattered in the nebula .",
    "however , it remains as an open question the nature of the knot e.    hh136-e is the brightest r - band source in the outflow region and is associated with the infrared source nirs  9 , whose infrared colors are consistent with a pre - main - sequence object @xcite .",
    "it has a very strong optical and infrared continuum , being practically absent of [ s ii ] , @xmath5 and [ fe ii ] emission @xcite .",
    "this makes a herbig - haro nature quite improbable . in spite of the suggestion from schmidt plates that knot",
    "e has an important h@xmath29 emission , no slit spectroscopy at its exact position has been done .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the knots hh136-a , hh136-b , hh136-e , and hh135  can be done using denis @xcite and 2mass @xcite data , and our photometry .",
    "none of these sources are detected in longer wavelengths .",
    "the sed of knot e has a rising slope from i to k band .",
    "a black body fit to this curve provides a bolometric luminosity of @xmath104  l@xmath7 , which would correspond to a zams star of @xmath102  m@xmath7 .    to explain the non - trivial radial velocity structure of the emission knots , and considering a same exciting source for hh135  and hh136  as indicated by previous k - band polarimetry ,",
    "@xcite have proposed a scenario in which one of the jets coming out from the exciting source is deflected by a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "the region of zero velocity is located around knots d , e , f , and g ( figure [ fig - sources ] ; see also figure 7 of @xcite ) . in this region",
    "there is also a slightly increase of the @xmath30co antenna temperature @xcite .",
    "besides , there is a msx source between knot f and g , which could represent the point of collision .",
    "so another possibility to the nature of knot e would be the point where the jet collides with the molecular cloud .",
    "a spectroscopic analysis of knot e as well as a detailed velocity study of the whole complex can probably shed some light in what is going on in this region and the true nature of this object .",
    "figure [ fig_sed ] shows the sed of iras 11101 - 5829 based on literature data ( see figure legend for the references ) . to estimate the bolometric luminosity of iras11101@xmath15829  we integrate a cubic spline to its sed which provides a value of @xmath31  l@xmath7 at a distance of 2.7 kpc",
    "this is in agreement with previous estimates from @xcite of @xmath32 l@xmath7 and from @xcite of @xmath33 l@xmath7 .",
    "both of them are based on iras data , but consider different corrections .",
    "the above luminosity can be used to constrain the stellar mass . using the massive stars evolutionary tracks of @xcite for z = 0.02",
    ", we estimate an interval of 11    25  m@xmath7  for the mass of the central object .",
    "the higher masses are obtained if the object is very young , with a convective envelope .",
    "the sed of an embedded source contains more information than just the luminosity of the central object .",
    "it results from the reprocessing of the stellar flux in the circumstellar environment . to exploit this aspect ,",
    "we have used the recently available grid of models of @xcite to reproduce the observed sed of iras11101@xmath15829 .",
    "we have concentrated on models whose parameters are :    * @xmath34 l@xmath7  @xmath35 l @xmath36 l@xmath7  - see discussion above ; * 11 m@xmath7  @xmath35 m @xmath35 25 m@xmath7  - see discussion above ; * i = 814 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider that the jets make an angle with the plane of sky of @xmath105  and that the disk is perpendicular to the jets . among the inclinations provided by @xcite",

    ", this corresponds to 37 .",
    "this is the largest aperture provided by the models .",
    "we have used it in order to approximate the the angular resolution of iras of @xmath10 90 .",
    "we have then 307 models which have been visually inspected .",
    "in doing this , we have selected the best 41 models for which we have calculated the @xmath37 values .",
    "we have found that the models # 3020025 and # 3007152 produced the smallest @xmath37 .",
    "table [ tab - sed ] shows the parameters of the models - we ask the reader to see a complete description of them in @xcite .",
    "this simple modelling provides a object with a mass of @xmath10 13 m@xmath7 , which puts the yso near the zams , with a age of  @xmath38 years .",
    "the above result is unexpected considering the presence of jets that are typical of a younger object . to discuss that issue",
    ", we would like to initially recall the optical knot j ( = nirs 17 ) .",
    "it is located at 18 from the iras11101@xmath15829  center position .",
    "however the error ellipse of this source is 19 x 5 , so it includes the optical / infrared source ( see figure [ fig - sources ] ) . in the ir and optical , the knot emission is dominated by a strong continuum and does not have [ s ii ] emission lines @xcite .",
    "so a herbig - haro nature appears to be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "the sed presents two maxima : in @xmath1060@xmath0 m and @xmath39 m .",
    "the above modelling has implicitly assumed that its near ir portion is caused by the circumstellar disk emission in the observer direction and therefore it should have the same center position of the far infrared emission .",
    "this might not be the case for hh135/hh136 .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , a possible geometry is one in which the near infrared yso emission ( produced in disk ) is obscured from the observer direct view , but it can flow from the pole and illuminate the nebular material in the jet region .",
    "we propose that the near ir sed ( the knot j ) is the yso reflected light in the pole cavity , as seen in hh  46 @xcite .",
    "in such a case , if the yso emission was isotropic , the knot j should trace the yso s sed .",
    "however , we should recall that the yso emits anisotropically .",
    "supposing the adopted inclination is correct , the knot j should receive the emission from a smaller inclination which has a larger near ir component .",
    "so the sed for an inclination of @xmath1081 as seen from a direct view , should have smaller fluxes at these wavelengths .",
    "this would result in models having properties of a more embedded , consequently younger , object . to do a proper modelling",
    "it would be necessary to know the 3d configuration of the knot j and the yso .",
    "we have presented optical linear polarimetry of hh135/hh136  and the nearby ism .",
    "our main results are listed below .    *",
    "the polarization of stars mapping the magnetic field in the star forming region is nearly parallel to the herbig haro outflow .",
    "we suggested that the elongation of dcld290.4 + 01.9  is also parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "* we estimated the interstellar magnetic field strength as of order 90 @xmath0 g . *",
    "the interstellar magnetic field direction and magnitude are adequate to play a role in determining the outflow direction and keeping the jet collimation",
    ". however , a collimation by a helicoidal magnetic field in the jet region is not discarded . *",
    "the r - band nebula associated with the hh pair has a clear reflection pattern whose center is the knot hh136-e .",
    "it seems to be a star , but its nature could not be securely determined and deserves more observational effort . * a simple modelling of the iras11101@xmath15829  sed indicates a mass of 13 m@xmath7  and an age of 1 myr , which is inconsistent with the presence of jets in the object .",

    "<S> the polarimetry of the field stars reveals two populations : one corresponds to a foreground interstellar component ; the other originates in the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the herbig - haro pair and , therefore , can be used to study the magnetic field in the star forming region . </S>",
    "<S> its direction is aligned with the jet of hh135/hh136 , which could be an indication that the interstellar magnetic field is important in the outflow collimation . </S>",
    "<S> the interstellar magnetic field magnitude was estimated to be of order 90 @xmath0 g . according to recent numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> an interstellar magnetic field of such strength can be important in the definition of the outflow direction . </S>",
    "<S> there is also evidence that the associated dark cloud has an elongation parallel to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> our image polarimetry of the extended emission associated with hh135/hh136  shows a centro - symmetric pattern pointing to the knot e of hh  136 . </S>",
    "<S> previous near infrared polarimetry traces a different illumination center , namely iras11101@xmath15829  - the probable exciting source of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be explained if the yso emission is completely blocked in optical wavelengths and the dominant optical source in the region is the knot e , whose nature is uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the spectral energy distributions of hh136-e and iras11101@xmath15829  is presented . </S>"
