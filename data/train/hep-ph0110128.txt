    "many nucleon properties can not be computed from first principles even though the fundamental theory that describes the strong interaction processes of hadrons , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is well established . in qcd hadrons are composites of quarks and gluons whose interactions are described within the non  abelian gauge theory of color @xmath0",
    ". however , perturbative techniques are not applicable in the low  energy region .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to consider models which can be deduced or at least motivated from qcd . in this context",
    "it has been fruitful to observe that qcd contains a hidden expansion parameter , @xmath1 , the number of colors .",
    "generalizing from @xmath0 to @xmath2 and assuming the confinement phenomena , qcd becomes equivalent to a theory of weakly interacting mesons in the limit of large @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "that is , the coupling constants of the meson interactions scale like @xmath3 while baryon masses and radii scale like @xmath1 and @xmath4 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "meson lagrangians may possess localized solutions to the field equations with finite field energy , the so  called solitons .",
    "soliton energies scale inversely with the meson coupling and their extensions approach constants as the coupling increases .",
    "it was thus conjectured that baryons emerge as solitons in the effective meson theory that is equivalent to qcd  @xcite .",
    "although this meson theory can not be derived from qcd , low ",
    "energy meson phenomenology provides sufficient constraints to model this theory .",
    "especially chiral symmetry and its breaking in the vacuum are essential .",
    "this introduces non  linear interactions for the pions , the ( would  be ) goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry , via the chiral field @xmath5 effective lagrangians are constructed from @xmath6 that are invariant under global chiral transformations @xmath7 .",
    "as @xmath8 at least two derivatives are required @xmath9 extracting the axial current @xmath10 from @xmath11 provides the electroweak coupling and determines the pion decay constant @xmath12 from @xmath13 .",
    "having established such a chiral model , a finite energy soliton solution must be obtained and quantized to describe baryon states .",
    "i will outline this approach in section 2 . in section 3",
    "i will consider three flavor extensions thereof with special emphasis on the role of flavor symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "i will employ these methods to compute axial current matrix elements of baryons in section 4 .",
    "these matrix elements are essential ingredients for the description of the nucleon spin structure  @xcite as they reflect its various quark flavor contributions  @xcite and they parameterize hyperon beta  decay .",
    "the effects of flavor symmetry breaking will be essential to discuss the strange quark contribution . in section  5",
    "i will discuss a different approach by starting from a simple model for the quark flavor dynamics .",
    "using standard bosonization techniques  @xcite this model is rewritten as a ( non  local ) meson field theory which can be shown to support chiral solitons  @xcite . as i will describe in sections  6 and  7 , the quark degrees of freedom can be traced through the bosonization procedure for the amplitude of virtual compton scattering .",
    "this paves the way to compute nucleon structure functions from the chiral quark soliton .",
    "finally section 8 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "scaling considerations show that the model  ( [ lag0 ] ) does not contain stable soliton solutions",
    ". therefore skyrme added a stabilizing term  @xcite @xmath14 + \\frac{1}{32e^2}{\\rm tr}\\left ( \\left[u^\\dagger\\partial_\\mu u , u^\\dagger\\partial_\\nu u\\right ] \\left[u^\\dagger\\partial^\\mu u , u^\\dagger\\partial^\\nu u\\right]\\right)\\ , , \\label{lagsk}\\ ] ] that is of fourth order in the derivatives but only quadratic in the time derivatives .",
    "there are other approaches to extend @xmath11 such that stable soliton solutions exist , as _",
    "e.g. _ including vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "although such extensions appear physically more motivated , i will stick to the skyrme model for pedagogical reasons when explaining the soliton picture for baryons .",
    "the soliton solution to ( [ lagsk ] ) assumes the famous hedgehog shape @xmath15 the equations of motion become an ordinary second order differential equation for the chiral angle @xmath16 that are obtained by extremizing the classical energy e_cl = e_cl[f]=d^3r \\ { ( r^2f^2 + 2sin^2f)+ ( 2f^2 + ) } .",
    "[ ecl ] it can be argued  @xcite that the baryon number equals the winding number associated with the mapping  ( [ hedgehog ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath17/\\pi$ ] .",
    "hence the boundary conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponding to unit baryon number determine the chiral angle uniquely .",
    "this soliton does not yet describe states of good spin and/or flavor as the _ ansatz _  ( [ hedgehog ] ) does not possess the corresponding symmetries .",
    "such states are generated by restoring these symmetries through collective coordinates @xmath20 @xmath21 and subsequent canonical quantization thereof  @xcite .",

    "the generalization to three flavors is carried out straightforwardly by taking @xmath30 with the hedgehog  ( [ hedgehog ] ) embedded in the isospin subgroup .",

    "furthermore , as it is linear in the time derivative it constrains @xmath32 to be quantized as a fermion ( for @xmath1 odd ) .",
    "the second extension originates from flavor symmetry breaking that is reflected by different masses and decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath33 the explicit form of @xmath34 is model dependent , however , the techniques to study its effects on baryon properties are general .    in @xmath0",

    "the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 reduces to sets of ordinary second order differential equations for isoscalar functions which only depend on the strangeness changing angle @xmath45  @xcite that can be integrated numerically .",
    "only the product @xmath46 appears in these differential equations which is thus interpreted as the effective strength of the flavor symmetry breaking . a value in the range @xmath47 is required to obtain reasonable agreement with the empirical mass differences for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 baryons  @xcite .",

    "that is , the baryon wave  functions exhibit strong distortion from flavor covariance .",
    "it is interesting to see what influence this has for baryon properties , in particular the hyperon beta  decay for which flavor covariance is known to work very well  @xcite .",

    "it will be necessary to trace the quark degrees of freedom as the meson model is constructed .",
    "as already mentioned , this can not be accomplished in qcd and therefore i will utilize a simpler model of the quark flavor dynamics .",

    "function leads to a significant reduction of the polarization of the strange quarks inside the nucleon .",
    "in the second part of these lectures i describe how an effective meson theory that contains chiral soliton solutions can be constructed from a simplified model for the quark flavor dynamics .",
    "since the quark degrees of freedom can be traced through this bosonization procedure it is possible to compute nucleon structure functions from this soliton .",
    "it turns out that additional correlations are introduced due to the unavoidable regularization which is imposed in a way to respect the chiral anomaly .",
