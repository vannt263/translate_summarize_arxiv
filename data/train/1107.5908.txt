    "these are exciting times for groups working on the modeling of photoinduced open strangeness production on the nucleon @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , over the last couple of years high - quality data in an extended energy range have become available .",
    "the data include single and double polarization observables .",
    "the selfanalyzing character of the @xmath5 facilitates so - called complete measurements for the @xmath6 process .",
    "these measurements could provide a way to determine the four independent amplitudes for kaon photoproduction at various combinations of the kinematic variables @xmath7 .",
    "modeling of @xmath4 reactions poses some real challenges which stem from the fact that one is dealing with a weak channel ( with cross sections of the order of @xmath8 ) in an energy range where one expects many overlapping resonances .",
    "accordingly , the background - resonance separation is even more challenging than in the pion production channels .",
    "coupled - channel approaches provide an analysis framework which are very demanding on human resources and involve a large amount of parameters .",
    "they represent tools to analyze photomeson production data in the search of @xmath9 and @xmath10 information like masses , widths and transition form factors , the regge - plus - resonance ( rpr ) framework for @xmath4 and @xmath11 developed by the ghent group @xcite is an economical single - channel model with very few parameters .",
    "the rpr model is sufficiently simple so that it can be used as elementary production operator in hypernuclear calculations for example . in this contribution , we illustrate that the rpr model has predictive power .",
    "first , one can reasonably predict @xmath12 observables from amplitudes which are optimized against the @xmath13 data .",
    "second , fair results for `` neutron '' targets are obtained by appropriately transforming the amplitudes for kaon photoproduction on the proton .",
    "cross sections as a function of the kaon - hyperon invariant mass @xmath14 for @xmath15 and two values of the four - momentum transfer @xmath16 .",
    "the dashed lines show the computed contribution from the background diagrams .",
    "the solid lines include the background and resonant contributions .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]    in the rpr model for @xmath17 the background is described by reggeizing the feynman diagrams involving pseudoscalar @xmath18 and vector @xmath19 meson exchange in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "this results in a mere three parameters which fully determine the background @xcite . adding the electric part of a reggeized @xmath21-channel born diagram ensures that one obtains a gauge - invariant model @xcite . in the rpr-2007 version of the model the background parameters are optimized against the @xmath22 data for @xmath23  gev .",
    "these data were obtained in the sixties and seventies , and it has been pointed out recently that there may be some normalization issues @xcite .",
    "the rpr-2011 version of the model uses the high - energy part of the recent jefferson lab data of ref .",
    "@xcite to optimize the background parameters .",
    "the resonance contributions are added to the reggeized background at the amplitude level .",
    "the resonances constitute the @xmath21 channel and are treated in the standard fashion with feynman diagrams .",
    "the rpr-2007 model considers the contribution of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 resonances to @xmath29 . since",
    "2007 more data have become available and this has allowed us to study also the role of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "not all of these resonances are identified to play a considerable role .",
    "the results of this analysis of the @xmath13 data will constitute the basis of the rpr-2011 model .",
    "the resonance parameters are tuned against the @xmath6 data .",
    "for some observables ( like the photon asymmetries for example ) one finds that the background describes the gross feature of the data .",
    "we adopt the view that the @xmath36 data provide a stringent test of the predictive power of the rpr model . a comparison between the rpr-2007 predictions and recent @xmath37 data is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the measured longitudinal and transverse cross section are of equal magnitude and exhibit a flat energy dependence .",
    "it is observed that the three - parameter background provides a fair estimate of the data .",
    "the resonances add some structure and some additional strength and improve the overall quality of agreement with the data .",
    "photon asymmetries as a function of the kaon - hyperon invariant mass @xmath14 for various @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed lines show the computed contribution from the background diagrams .",
    "the solid lines include the background and resonant contributions .",
    "the data are from @xcite .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical errors .",
    "systematic errors amount to @xmath39 . ]",
    "strangeness photoproduction involves two @xmath5 ( @xmath13 , @xmath40 ) and four @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) channels . in order to connect the various channels",
    ", it suffices to convert the coupling constants featuring in the rpr interaction lagrangians . in the strong interaction vertices one can fall back on isospin symmetry to determine the conversion factors for the coupling strengths between the different channels . in the electromagnetic interaction vertices in the @xmath21 channel the coupling strengths",
    "@xmath46 can be written in terms of the photocoupling helicity amplitudes @xmath47 .",
    "for example , after equating the proton and neutron mass , one finds for a @xmath48 with @xmath49 @xmath50 experimentally determined values for the helicity amplitudes are available from analyses like said @xcite or rpp @xcite of the pion production data . unfortunately , in the second and higher resonance region relevant to kaon photoproduction the extracted values for @xmath47 have considerable error bars and are only available for some selected resonances .",
    "in addition , the various analyses often produce inconsistent results . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have addressed the issue whether the rpr model can predict @xmath45 observables starting from a limited set of parameters which are constrained against the @xmath51 reaction channel . in figure",
    "2 we show the computed rpr result for the @xmath45 photon asymmetries .",
    "the data result from selecting quasi - free events in @xmath52 measurements .",
    "the model calculations include both the background and the resonant contribution and represent predictions which are anchored to the @xmath42 channel through isospin symmetry .",
    "it is remarkable that with the background diagrams one obtains a fair description of the angular and energy dependence of the photon asymmetries .",
    "one can conclude that rpr framework allows one to determine the background contributions to @xmath4 in a highly resilient fashion .",
    "the resonance contributions to the @xmath45 photon asymmetries are rather moderate . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the resonances represent large corrections to the differential cross sections .",
    "with regard to the resonance contributions , the mentioned uncertainties on the helicity amplitudes heavily restrain the predictive power of the rpr model and other isobar models for @xmath53 .",
    "the error bars on the helicity amplitudes , for example , give rise to sizable theoretical error bands in the computed resonance contributions @xcite .",
    "the rpr model provides the elementary production operator for a recently developed covariant model for @xmath54 reactions @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath55 final - state interactions ( fsi ) has been evaluated . at low missing momenta ,",
    "the effect is small and the deuteron acts as a real neutron target . at high missing momenta ,",
    "the @xmath55 fsi are large . under those conditions ,",
    "the @xmath54 reaction provides a good window on the elusive @xmath55 interaction . at high missing momenta ,",
    "however , the cross sections are small and the computed @xmath54 observables are prone to uncertainties stemming from the deuteron wave function and the off - shell extrapolation of the elementary production operator ."
