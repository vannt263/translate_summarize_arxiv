    "<S> nitrogen - doped carbon nanotubes can provide reactive sites on the porphyrin - like defects . </S>",
    "<S> it s well known that many porphyrins have transition metal atoms , and we have explored transition metal atoms bonded to those porphyrin - like defects in n - doped carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure and transport are analized by means of a combination of density functional theory and recursive green s functions methods . </S>",
    "<S> the results determined the heme b - like defect ( an iron atom bonded to four nitrogens ) as the most stable and with a higher polarization current for a single defect . </S>",
    "<S> with randomly positioned heme b - defects in a few hundred nanometers long nanotubes the polarization reaches near 100% meaning an effective spin filter . </S>",
    "<S> a disorder induced magnetoresistance effect is also observed in those long nanotubes , values as high as 20000% are calculated with non - magnectic eletrodes .    since their discovery by iijima in 1991 , </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes@xcite ( cnt ) have become the subject of intense research due to their potential for applications,@xcite such as in novel electronic devices.@xcite furthermore , in a seminal paper by tsukagoshi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ cnts entered the realm of spintronics , whereby one envision the possibility of using the electron spin , instead of its charge , as information carrier.@xcite in that work the authors demonstrated that the spin coherence length of polarized electrons injected onto cnts is larger than 300 nm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , carbon nanotube devices could be used to manipulate spins in a coherent manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the prototypical spintronics device uses spin - polarized electrons , which are injected from a source into an unpolarized region and analyzed by a polarized drain . within this arrangement the so - called giant magnetoresistance effect ( gmr)@xcite manifests itself by altering - via an external magnetic field - the relative orientations of the magnetic moments of the electrodes . from a practical point of view </S>",
    "<S> this setup usually involves sandwiching different materials . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to this has been given by kirwan et al . </S>",
    "<S> whereby initially unpolarized electrons are scattered by magnetic impurities adsorbed on the surface of a segment of a carbon nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> this way , both the electrodes as well as the device itself are made of the same material .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to this has been given by kirwan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite whereby initially unpolarized electrons are scattered by magnetic impurities adsorbed on the surface of a segment of a carbon nanotube.@xcite this way , both the electrodes as well as the device itself are made of the same material , thus avoiding issues related to surface matching at the interface consequently hindering spurious scattering .        </S>",
    "<S> however , one of the issues concerning the use of cnts as spintronics devices is the need to incorporate dopants or defects in order to change their electronic transport properties . closed shell species </S>",
    "<S> do not interact very strongly with the pristine wall of a carbon nanotube.@xcite furthermore , transition metal atoms are more likely to form clusters when interacting with the pristine wall of the nanotube .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite even linear chains of fe atoms are more energetically favorable than free standing iron atoms .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    one possible path to circumvent this problem is to incorporate doping agents during the growth process . in that context , carbon nanotubes sythetized in a nitrogen - rich atmosphere - the so - called @xmath0 nanotubes - are potential candidates.@xcite it has already been demonstrated that these nanotubes could be , for example , used as gas sensors for a variety of chemical species.@xcite    the most stable defect in these structures is a pyridine - like defect consisting of a 4 nitrogen divacancy ( 4nd).@xcite this defect ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1]a ) is formed by two vacancies surrounded by four substitutional nitrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously exploited the reactivity of this defect to attach ammonia molecules and study the behavior of the system as a sensor.@xcite interestingly , this defect is similar to molecules in the porphyrin class , in particular , to a molecule known as heme - b ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1]b ) , which is found , for instance , in hemoglobin and myoglobin . </S>",
    "<S> this heme b molecule has an iron atom bonded to the site with four nitrogens . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is intuitive to assume that an iron atom - and other transition metal ( tm ) atoms - gets bonded to the 4nd defect of the carbon nanotubes .    </S>",
    "<S> the heme b - like defect has been recently synthesized by lee et , al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite their stability was studied by means of repeated cyclic voltammograms , and they have not observed significant differences after @xmath1 cycles , which is attributed to the stability of the covalent incorporation of the atoms .    the use of carbon nanotubes - or any other long one dimensional system - with defects , however , poses an additional problem ; the position of the defects can not be controlled during growth . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a device with a large number of randomly positioned defects . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to obtain quantitatively meaningful theoretical predictions , one must take into consideration the effects of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> it is generally assumed that disorder has a detrimental effect . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , we have shown that one - dimensional boron - doped graphene nanoribbons can present near - perfect conductance polarization due to disorder.@xcite such an effect should not depend on the system under consideration provided there was a difference in transmission probabilities for majority and minority spin cases for a single scatterer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the introduction of a large number of defects with non - zero magnetic moment leads not only to structural disorder , but also to a magnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the magnetic moments of the impurities might be pointing in random directions . </S>",
    "<S> we can then consider that , in the absence of a magnetic field , approximately half of the moments are pointing up and half of them are pointing down . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field would tend to align the magnetic moments leading to an analogous to the magnetoresistance effect without the need to rely on a multilayered material .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we show that porphyrin - like cnts can exhibit a nearly - perfect polarization and extremely large disorder induced magnetoresistance ( as high as 20000% ) driven by disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder was simulated using cnts containing a large number of magnetic impurities randomly positioned along the tube . </S>",
    "<S> for those calculations we used a combination of density functional theory@xcite coupled to recursive green s functions methods@xcite .    we have initially performed _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations within density functional theory ( dft)@xcite for a segment of a ( 5,5 ) @xmath0 nanotube containing a 4nd defect ( figure [ figure1]a ) . as we have said before </S>",
    "<S> , the porphyrin molecules can have different tm in the 4nd site , as shown in figure [ figure1]b . </S>",
    "<S> we , thus , performed calculations using iron , cobalt , manganese and nickel atoms in the middle of the 4nd defect . </S>",
    "<S> the final arrangement for the case of iron is presented in figure [ figure1]c . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , nine irreducible cells of the pristine system were used to describe the region containing the defect . </S>",
    "<S> the computational code used was siesta  @xcite which uses a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) as basis set . in the particular case of this work </S>",
    "<S> we have employed a double zeta basis set with polarization orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as parametrized by perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite ( pbe ) for the exchange correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the atomic coordinates have been optimized using a conjugated gradient scheme until the forces on atoms were lower than 0.03 ev /  .    furthermore , in order to assess whether the transition metal atoms in adjacent cells are magnetically coupled@xcite we simulated a supercell with 18 irreducible cells ( twice the initial size ) with two heme - b - like defects ; one case with ferromagnetic ordering ( @xmath2 ) , and another with a antiferromagnetic one ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy difference ( e@xmath4-e@xmath5 ) is negligible for all transition metal atoms considered in this work , so we infer that there s no magnetic coupling in our system .    for the electronic transport calculations , the system - following the procedure proposed by carolli _ _ </S>",
    "<S> et al__@xcite - is initially divided in three regions namely , the right and the left electrodes and a central scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> the electrodes for our system are taken as semi - infinite repetitions of the pristine carbon nanotube . in the absence of spin - orbit interactions </S>",
    "<S> one assumes the two spin fluid approximation , whereby one can calculate the electronic transport properties of the majority and minority spins independently of each other . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the landauer - bttiker  @xcite formula to calculate the transmission coefficients of the system .        in order to access the electronic transport properties of a more realistic system with hundreds of nanometers we use a combination of dft and recursive green s function methods .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to do so , we split up a long nanotube into small pieces . </S>",
    "<S> each piece is simulated using a separate dft calculation as already described previously , and the hamiltonian and overlap opperators respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 are stored . for our ( 5,5 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 nt we also have to consider five different rotations for the position of the defect . with those smaller blocks we build up a long nanotube , ranging from 20 to 600 nanometers , by randomly placing the segments with defects together with pristine pieces , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ long ] . </S>",
    "<S> one then recursively reduce the system to two renormalized electrodes coupled via an effective scattering potential that contains all the information about the central region .    in the low bias limit </S>",
    "<S> the differential spin - dependent conductance can be calculated by the landauer - buttiker formula for the current @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi distribution function for a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the total conductance is then given by the sum of the majority and minority conductances , @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in order to quantify the spin filtering effect of this device , we calculate the degree of polarization@xcite @xmath11    secondly , as discussed earlier one also needs to take into consideration the relative orientations of the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> one can analyze the changes in conductance due to an external magnetic field that tends to align the local magnetization of each impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field in our calculations is taken into consideration only in the alignment of the magnetic moments , it has no other effect on the electronic structure of our system . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the value of this disorder induced magnetoresistance ( mr ) is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 corresponds to the total conductance for the case where all of the magnetic moments are pointing along the same direction , and @xmath14 is the total conductance for the case where there is an equal distribution of positive and negative magnetic moments .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , in these long and disordered @xmath0 nanotubes , different defect distributions along the @xmath0 give different values of conductance . in order to get statistically meaningful values of conductance </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated about 200 random arrangements for each concentration and length of the nanotubes .     </S>",
    "<S> for cn@xmath15 nanotube containing an iron atom ( heme - b - like defect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the net magnetic moment of the system is localized in the iron atom.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    upon placing the different tm atoms in the 4nd , we observe that they strongly bind with a similar final structure in all situations . </S>",
    "<S> table [ table1 ] shows the binding energies and the final magnetization of the system for each one of the tm atoms . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , the binding energies are relatively high ( the reference is the isolated atom infinitelly separated from the nanotube ) . </S>",
    "<S> one also sees a local magnetic moment in all cases , except for the nickel atom . a similar behavior was also observed by shang , _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ .@xcite in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rhoupdn ] we present the local magnetic moment , @xmath16 of the heme b - like defect . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we can notice a highly localized magnetic moment in the iron atom .    .binding energy , magnetization and polarization for different transition metal atoms bonded to the 4nd defect . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ lengths100 ]    in order to address the effect of a magnetic field applied to the system and the possibility that not all the magnetic moments are completely aligned we also considered that only 80% of the defects are magnetically aligned . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure [ condpol2 ] , and the linear fits for the localization lengths also are presented in table [ lengths100 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can note a decrease ( increase ) in localization length for majority ( minority ) spin compared to the 100 % case . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since one is moving towards higher magnetic disorder , _ i.e. _ the 50 % case . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ condpol2]c we can see a polarization near 100% for 700 nm long @xmath0 nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the magnetoresistance ( fig . [ condpol2]d ) presents values which are one order of magnitude lower than the fully aligned arrangement , but it is still in the 1000 % range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even in the case where not all spins are aligned , there is still an extremely large disorder induced magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this disorder - driven gmr effect is extremely robust toward fluctuations in the alignment of the magnetic moments .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used an ideal paramagnet model to estimate the needed magnetic field to obtain a 80% magnetization at 300k and 3k . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the needed magnetic field at ambient temperature is about 200 t , making it impracticable for ambient temperature devices . </S>",
    "<S> for a temperature of 3k the needed field will be about 2 t for an 80% magnetization and about 5 t for a 95% magnetization , so it s possible to observe the predicted effects in this paper in low temperature experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary we have observed that transition metal atoms bind strongly to nitrogen defects in cn@xmath15 carbon nanotubes in a fashion similar to heme b molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the end result is a scattering site with a localized magnetic moment on the transition metal atom that leads to a small conductance polarization in the case of a single impurity . for a large number of such impurities randomly distributed along carbon nanotubes a few hundred nanometers long </S>",
    "<S> , it leads to near perfect polarization and a large magnetoresistance ( up to 20000% ) . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of the system proposed here is the fact that they do not need polarized electrodes as it is usually the case . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that , at low temperature , this effect could be measured experimentally . </S>"
