    "with the advent of mesoscopic physics , it has become possible to experimentally investigate quantum phase coherent properties of electrons in solid state conductors in a controlled way . in particular , in ballistic mesoscopic samples at low temperatures , electrons can propagate up to several microns without loosing phase information .",
    "this opens up the possibility to investigate electrical analogs of various optical phenomena and experiments .",
    "an investigation of such analogs is of fundamental interest . on the one hand",
    ", it allows one to establish similarities between the properties of photons and conduction electrons , a consequence of the wave nature of the quantum particles . on the other hand",
    ", it also allows one to investigate the differences between the two types of particles arising from the different quantum statistical properties of fermions and bosons . for many - particle properties , such as light intensity correlations or correspondingly electrical current correlations , noise , the quantum statistical properties are important .",
    "@xcite both the wave - nature of the particles as well as their quantum statistics are displayed in a clearcut fashion in interferometer structures . in this work",
    "we are concerned with the electrical analogs of two well known optical interferometers , the single - particle mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer and the two - particle hanbury brown twiss ( hbt ) interferometer .",
    "the mz - interferometer is a subject of most textbooks in optics .",
    "@xcite in the framework of quantum optics , considering individual photons rather than classical beams of light , the interference arises due to the superposition of the amplitudes for two different possible paths of a single photon .",
    "this leads to an interference term in the light intensity .",
    "the mz - interferometer is thus a prime example of a single particle interferometer.@xcite various electronic interferometers with ballistic transport of the electrons have been investigated experimentally over the last decades , as e.g. aharonov - bohm ( ab ) rings@xcite and double - slit interferometers.@xcite detailed investigations of dephasing in ballistic interferometers was carried out in refs .",
    "[ ] . only very recently was the first electronic mz - interferometer realized by ji et al.@xcite in a mesoscopic conductor in the quantum hall regime .",
    "a high visibility of the conductance oscillations was observed , however the visibility was not perfect .",
    "this led the authors to investigate in detail various sources for dephasing .",
    "as a part of this investigation , also shot noise was measured .",
    "still , some aspects of the experiment are not yet fully understood .",
    "theoretically , seelig and one of the authors@xcite investigated the effect of dephasing due to nyquist noise on the conductance in a mz - interferometer .",
    "the effect of dephasing on the closely related four - terminal resistance in ballistic interferometers @xcite was investigated as well .",
    "dephasing in ballistic strongly interacting systems is discussed by le hur .",
    "@xcite following the experimental work of ji et al.,@xcite marquardt and bruder investigated the effect of dephasing on the shot - noise in mz - interferometers , considering dephasing models based on both classical@xcite as well as quantum fluctuating fields .",
    "@xcite very recently , frster , pilgram and one of the authors @xcite extended the dephasing model of refs .",
    "[ ] to the full statistical distribution of the transmitted charge .",
    "the hbt - interferometer @xcite was originally invented for stellar astronomy , to measure the angular diameter of stars .",
    "it is an intensity , or two - particle,@xcite interferometer .",
    "the interference arises from the superposition of the amplitudes for two different two - particle processes .",
    "importantly , there is no single particle interference in the hbt - interferometer .",
    "consequently , in contrast to the mz - interferometer there is no interference in the light intensity , the interference instead appears in the intensity - intensity correlations .",
    "moreover , the intensity - intensity correlation also display the effect of quantum statistics .",
    "photons originating from thermal sources tend to bunch , giving rise to positive intensity cross correlations . for the electronic analog of the hbt - interferometer , it was the corresponding anti - bunching of electrons that originally attracted interest .",
    "it was predicted @xcite that the electrical current cross correlations in mesoscopic conductors would be manifestly negative , i.e. display anti - bunching , as a consequence of the fermionic statistics of the electrons .",
    "negative current cross correlations were subsequently observed in two independent experiments.@xcite recently , anti - bunching for field emitted electrons in vacuum was also demonstrated.@xcite the two - particle interference in the hbt - experiment has received much less attention .",
    "we emphasize that while the bunching of the photons was necessary for obtaining a finite , positive cross correlation signal , it was the two - particle effect that was of main importance to hbt since the angular diameter of the star was determined from the two - particle interference pattern . in electrical conductors , two - particle effects in ab - interferometers",
    "were investigated theoretically in refs .",
    "only very recently two of the authors and sukhorukov@xcite proposed a direct electronic analog of the optical hbt - interferometer which permits to demonstrate two - particle interference in an unambiguous way .    in this work",
    "we investigate and compare in detail the current and and zero - frequency noise in electronic mz and hbt interferometers .",
    "we consider interferometers implemented in mesoscopic conductors in the integer quantum hall regime , where the transport takes place along single edge states and quantum point contacts ( qpc s ) serve as controllable beam splitters .",
    "the effect of finite temperature , applied bias and asymmetry , i.e. unequal length of the interferometer arms , is investigated .",
    "the strength of the interference contribution is quantified via the visibility of the phase oscillations .",
    "the dependence of the visibility on the beam splitter transparencies as well as on the temperature , voltage and asymmetry is discussed in detail . of interest is the comparison of visibility of the shot - noise correlation of the mz - interferometer and the hbt - intensity interferometer . shot noise correlations in the mz - interferometer exhibit two contributions , one with the fundamental period of @xmath0 and a second harmonic with period @xmath1 .",
    "the shot noise correlations in the hbt - interferometer , even though they are due to two particle processes , are periodic with period @xmath0 .",
    "thus the aharonov - bohm period can not be used to identify the two particle processes which give rise to the hbt effect .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether the hbt two - particle processes have any other signature , for instance in the temperature or voltage dependence of the visibility of the shot - noise correlation .",
    "we find that this is not the case . to the contrary , we find that the the shot noise correlations in the hbt intensity interferometer behave qualitatively similar to the @xmath0 shot noise correlation in the mz - interferometer .",
    "in contrast the @xmath1 contribution in the shot noise of the mz - interferometer decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature , voltage or dephasing rate than the @xmath0 oscillation in the mz- or hbt - interferometer .",
    "we investigate dephasing of the electrons propagating along the edge states by connecting one of the interferometer arms to a fictitious , dephasing voltage probe . in all cases ,",
    "the current and noise of the mz - interferometer as well as the noise in the hbt - interferometer , the effect of the voltage probe is equivalent to the effect of a slowly fluctuating phase .",
    "in the paper we consider implementations of the mz and hbt interferometers in mesoscopic conductors in strong magnetic fields , in the integer quantum hall regime.@xcite the typical system is a two - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor heterostructure , with the lateral confinement of the electron gas controllable via electrostatic gating .",
    "the transport between reservoirs@xcite connected to the conductor takes place along edge states.@xcite the edge states , quantum analogs of classical skipping orbits , are chiral , the transport along an edge state is unidirectional .",
    "scattering between edge states is suppressed everywhere in the conductor except at electrostatically controllable constrictions , qpcs.@xcite for a magnetic field that does not break the spin degeneracy of the edge states , each edge state supplies two conduction modes , one per spin .",
    "these properties make conductors in the integer quantum hall regime ideal for realizing analogs of optical experiments .",
    "first , the edge states correspond to single mode waveguides for the light .",
    "the unidirectional motion along the edge states allows for `` beams '' of electrons to be realized .",
    "second , the qpc s work as electronic beam splitters with controllable transparency . moreover",
    ", due to chirality the beamsplitters are reflectionless , a property essential for the mz and hbt interferometers but difficult to achieve for beam splitters in conductors in weak ( or zero ) magnetic fields.@xcite these properties of conductors in the quantum hall regime have been demonstrated experimentally in a number of works , see e.g. [ ] .    theoretically , several works have been concerned with the conductance and noise properties of beam splitters and interferometers in quantum hall systems , for a recent reviews see e.g. refs . [ ]",
    "recently , it was proposed to use these appealing properties of edge states in the context of orbital @xcite quasi - particle entanglement in static @xcite and dynamic @xcite systems as well as for quantum state transfer.@xcite    it is interesting to note that the edge state description also hold for conductors at even higher magnetic fields , in the fractional quantum hall regime . as examples",
    ", the fractional charge has been determined in shot - noise experiments@xcite and the quantum statistical properties of the fractionally charged quasi - particles have been investigated theoretically in beam - splitter@xcite and hbt@xcite geometries .",
    "various interferometer structures have also been considered.@xcite very recently , a mz - interferometer in the fractional quantum hall regime was proposed.@xcite in this work we however consider only the integer quantum hall effect , where the quasi - particles are noninteracting and the electrical analogs to optical experiments can be directly realized .",
    "this discussion leads us to consider single mode , multi - terminal conductors with noninteracting electrons .",
    "the principle aim of this work is a comparison of the mz and hbt - interferometers . in reality in both interferometers interactions ( screening )",
    "play a role both for the voltage and temperature dependence .",
    "a non - interacting scattering approach is not gauge invariant but requires a treatment of screening .",
    "@xcite however , these effects are expected to be simliar in the two interferometers and will not affect the main conclusions of this work . therefore ,",
    "below we treat non - interacting qausi - particle interferometers .",

    "we are not interested in any particular mechanism for dephasing but consider instead a phenomenological model , a dephasing voltage probe .",
    "the idea of using a voltage probe to induce dephasing was introduced in refs .",
    "a voltage probe connected to a mesoscopic sample was considered , leading to a suppression of coherent transport due to inelastic scattering .",
    "the probe model , originally considered for the average current , was extended to treat the effect of inelastic scattering on shot noise by bttiker and beenakker@xcite by considering a conservation of current fluctuations at the probe as well . later de jong and beenakker@xcite extended the voltage probe concept and introduced a ( fictitious ) voltage probe which breaks phase but does not dissipate energy .",
    "scattering in the voltage probe is ( quasi-)elastic . this",
    "is achieved with the help of a distribution function in the voltage probe which conserves not only total current like a real voltage probe , but conserves current in every small energy interval .",
    "such a probe provides a model of pure dephasing .",
    "the different probe models have been used as qualitative models in a number of works , see refs .",
    "[ ] for a review . for an application to quantum hall systems ,",

    "the model is based on the assumption that the current is conserved on a time scale @xmath28 , much shorter than the time of the measurement but much longer than the time between injection of individual electrons , here of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "one could however consider a more general voltage probe model that takes into account a more complicated dynamics of the probe .",
    "a detailed discussion of such a general model in the light of recent work@xcite is however deferred to a later work .",
    "here we only note that below we find that the voltage probe in both the mz and hbt - interferometers only gives rise to a suppression of the phase dependent terms in conductance and noise , just as one would naively expect to be the effect of pure dephasing .",

    "<S> we investigate the visibility of the current and shot - noise correlations of electrical analogs of the optical mach - zehnder interferometer and the hanbury brown twiss interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical analogs are discussed in conductors subject to high magnetic fields where electron motion is along edge states . </S>",
    "<S> the transport quantities are modulated with the help of an aharonov - bohm flux . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the conductance ( current ) visibility and shot noise visibility as a function of temperature and applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> dephasing is introduced with the help of fictitious voltage probes . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of these two interferometers is of interest since the mach - zehnder interferometer is an amplitude ( single - particle ) interferometer whereas the hanbury brown twiss interferometer is an intensity ( two - particle ) interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison is only possible for the shot noise of the two interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the visibility of shot noise correlations of the hanbury brown twiss interferometer as function of temperature , voltage or dephasing , is qualitatively similar to the visibility of the first harmonic of the shot noise correlation of the mach - zehnder interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the second harmonic of the shot noise visibility of the mach - zehnder interferometer decreases much more rapidly with increasing temperature , voltage or dephasing rate . </S>"
