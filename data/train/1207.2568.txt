    "how to apprehend the beginning of the hot  big bang \" model has been still a significant issue .",

    "however , the universe still requires a beginning , since in inflationary scenario any backward null or timelike geodesic has a finite affine length @xcite .",
    "the idea of the emergent universe is interesting @xcite,@xcite , in this scenario the universe originates from a static state in the infinite past . in emergent universe scenario",
    ", it seems that there might be not a beginning , since the affine length of backward null or timelike geodesic is classical infinite .",
    "however , for the model , in which the initial static state is constructed by applying a positive curvature , the static universe will inevitably collapse quantum mechanically @xcite,@xcite .    in refs.@xcite,@xcite , after the universe emerges from the static state , the inflation will be required to set the initial conditions of  big bang \" model , i.e.the homogenizing and the scale invariant primordial perturbation .    however , when the universe emerges , or begins to deviate from static state , it might be slowly expanding . in ref.@xcite , it has been for the first time observed that the slow expansion might adiabatically generate the scale invariant curvature perturbation , see @xcite for that induced by the entropy perturbation .",
    "thus it might be imaginable that in emergent universe scenario , the initial state of  big bang \" evolution could be set during this slowly expanding period . during the slow expansion",
    ", @xmath0 is required @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus in ref.@xcite , the phantom has been applied for a phenomenological studying .",
    "recently , the cosmological application of galileon , @xcite , or its nontrivial generalization @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , has acquired increasing attentions , e.g. see @xcite,@xcite for dark energy , @xcite,@xcite for inflation , @xcite for curvaton and @xcite for bouncing universe , in which @xmath0 can be implemented stably , there is not the ghost instability .",
    "the models of the emergent universe scenario can be realized with galileon , e.g.@xcite , and also @xcite .",
    "however , in refs.@xcite,@xcite , the adiabatic perturbation is not scale invariant , thus the obtaining of the scale invariant curvature perturbation has to appeal to the conversion of the perturbations of other light scalar fields , i.e. the mechanism similar to that in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , we showed that actually the scale invariant curvature perturbation may be adiabatically generated @xcite . here , with ref.@xcite",
    ", we will make the relevant scenario clearer .    here",
    ", we will parameterize the evolutions of the slow expansion , which emerges from a static state in infinite past , into different classes , and clarify how the adiabatical perturbation generated could be scale invariant for these parameterizations .",
    "when the slow expansion phase ends , the universe reheats and the evolution of  big bang \" model begins . we have showed in ref.@xcite that one of these parameterizations can be realized by applying a generalized galileon . here",
    ", we will show that the other parameterization can be also realized similarly , and the results may be consistent with the observations .",
    "that in infinite past the universe is a static state , in which @xmath1 is constant , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the physical size of initial universe , requires h0 , when t - infinity .",
    "[ hrequire]thus the corresponding evolutions can be parameterized as h & ~ & 1^b(t_*-t)^b+1 , [ h1 ] + & or & e^-(t_*-t ) , [ h2]where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constant .",
    "thus in infinite past the behavior of @xmath7 is power law or is exponential .",
    "however , of course , the behavior of @xmath8 could be also double exponential h & ~ & e^-e^(t_*-t ) , [ h3 ] + & or & higher exponential.here , we will be only limited to ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath9 is given by a & ~ & e^ 1/[^b(t_*-t)^b ] , ( parameterizationi ) [ model1 ] + & or & e^e^-(t_*-t ) , ( parameterizationii ) , [ model2]where @xmath10 is set in the infinite past .",
    "when @xmath11 , @xmath12 for ( [ model1 ] ) and @xmath13 for ( [ model2 ] ) .",
    "thus in the regime @xmath14 , the universe is slowly expanding . thus we may define the  emergence \" as a period of slow expansion , which emerges from a static state in infinite past .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been showed that in a cosmological scenario , if @xmath15 , this scenario will be incomplete in the infinite past , since any backward null geodesic will have a finite affine length , i.e. a beginning is required . here",
    ", @xmath16 is an average over the affine parameter , and is defined as @xcite h_average=^t_fh()d^t_fd < 1^t_fd , [ ha]where @xmath17 is the affine parameter of the backward null geodesic , @xmath18 , which gives ^t_fh()d=^a(t_f)da < 1 . [ hda]eq.([ha ] ) is universal , independent of models .",
    "thus with ( [ hda ] ) , @xmath19 implies that the affine length @xmath20 must be finite .",
    "we can calculate the affine length of the backward null geodesic for the slow expansion , which is parameterized as ( [ model1 ] ) or ( [ model2 ] ) , which is ^t_f d & = & ^t_f a dt , + & ~ & e^x_1x_1 ^ 1 + 1/b_0^x_1f+_0^x_1f 1x_1 ^ 2 + 1/be^x_1dx_1 , [ lambda2 ] + & or & e^x_2x_2_0^x_2f+_0^x_2f",

    "when @xmath21 , the result of ( [ lambda1 ] ) is the same with that of ( [ lambda2 ] ) , thus the affine length of the backward null geodesic in parameterization ( [ model1 ] ) is same with that in parameterization ( [ model2 ] ) , which implies that ( [ model2 ] ) is actually the limit case of ( [ model1 ] ) .    here , the definition of @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
