    "a growing number of observational studies of globular cluster systems ( gcss ) have revealed interesting correlations between physical properties of gcss and those of their host galaxies ( see brodie & strader 2006 for a recent review ) . for example , strader et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that mean colors of metal - poor globular clusters ( gcs ) correlate with luminosities of their host galaxies and accordingly suggested that mean gc metallicities ( @xmath1 ) depend on luminosities ( @xmath2 ) of their host galaxies such that @xmath15 .",
    "similar results ( @xmath16 ) were found using the advanced camera for surveys on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ by peng et al .",
    "( 2006 ; p06 ) .",
    "brodie & strader ( 2006 ) have suggested that the relation was steeper in the past .",
    "they argue that more enriched metal - poor gcs form first in low mass objects ( from early collapsing peaks at high redshift ) .",
    "these low - mass building blocks merge , ultimately forming the massive galaxies of high density regions today .",
    "thus the slope , particularly at the high mass end , flattens over time .    although such observed correlations between the physical properties of gcss and their host galaxies have been suggested to contain fossil information of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; forbes & forte 2001 ; west et al . 2004 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) , the details remain largely unclear owing to the lack of theoretical and numerical studies of gcss .",
    "based on dissipationless numerical simulations of major galaxy mergers with gcs , bekki & forbes ( 2006 ) first demonstrated that the gcs radial density profiles dependent on galaxy luminosity can be understood in terms of the number of major merger events experienced .",
    "the dependence of gc destruction on host galaxy mass has also been suggested to be important for understanding the inner radial density profiles ( baumgardt 1998 ; vesperini et al .",
    "2003 ; capuzzo - dolcetta 2006 ) .",
    "the formation of gcs in low - mass dark matter halos at high redshifts have been investigated by numerical and theoretical studies ( e.g. , broom & clarke 2002 ; mashchenko & sills 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the physical properties of gcss have recently been discussed by several authors based on hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios where gc formation occurs at high redshifts ( e.g. , beasley et al .",
    "2002 ; kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ; santos 2003 ; bekki 2005 ; rhode et al .",

    "( 2002 ) first demonstrated that the observed bimodal color distributions of gcss in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced by a semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "they also presented gc colour vs galaxy magnitude relations , however they did not fully reproduce the observed trend .",
    "although these previous works discussed some physical properties of gcss in galaxies , they did not explore in detail .",
    "the correlations between gcss and those of their host galaxy .",
    "thus it remains unclear how the physical properties of gcss evolve in a hierarchical merging cosmology .",
    "the properties of _ metal - poor gcs ( mpcs ) _",

    "we investigate the structural , kinematical , and chemical properties of mpcs .",
    "we also present several predictions for the expected correlations between properties of mpc systems ( such as half - number radii , effective surface number densities , and velocity dispersions ) . since the present model is based on dissipationless simulations of mpc formation within halos at high redshifts , the origin of _ metal - rich gcs ( mrcs ) _",
    "( [ fe / h ] @xmath17 @xmath19 ) formed somewhat later during dissipative merging will not be discussed .",
    "we plan to investigate mrcs in a future paper by combining the present high - resolution cosmological simulation with semi - analytic models similar to those used by beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe our numerical models of mpc formation and their assumed initial properties . in  3 , we present our numerical results on ( i ) @xmath8 relations , ( ii ) scaling relations between properties of mpcs , and ( iii ) metallicity - magnitude relations for luminous mpcs in massive galaxies ( the so - called ` blue - tilt ' ) . in  4 , we discuss our results .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "appendices explore scaling relation dependency on m@xmath20/l and z@xmath21 . throughout this paper ,",
    "gcss in our simulations are composed only of mpcs .",
    "we simulate the large scale structure of gcs in a @xmath22cdm universe with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 km @xmath26 @xmath27 , and @xmath28 by using the adaptive mesh refinement @xmath29body code developed by yahagi ( 2005 ) and yahagi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is a vectorized and parallelized version of the code described in yahagi & yoshii ( 2001 ) .",
    "we use @xmath30 collisionless dark matter ( dm ) particles in a simulation with the box size of @xmath31mpc and the total mass of @xmath32 .",
    "we start simulations at @xmath33 and follow it until @xmath4 in order to investigate physical properties of old gcs outside and inside virialized dark matter halos .",
    "we used cosmics ( cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ) , which is a package of fortran programs for generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation simulations ( bertschinger 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "our method of investigating gc properties is described as follows .",
    "firstly , we select virialized dark matter subhalos at a truncation redshift @xmath3 by using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( davis et al . 1985 ) with a fixed linking length of 0.2 times the mean dm particle separation .",
    "the minimum particle number @xmath34 for halos is set to be 10 . for each individual virialized subhalo with a half - mass radius of @xmath35 , particles within @xmath36",
    "are labeled as `` gc '' particles and are considered to be old mpcs .",
    "this procedure for defining gc particles is based on the assumption that energy dissipation via radiative cooling allows baryons to fall into the deepest potential well of dark - matter halos and finally to be converted into gcs . the value of the truncation radius ( @xmath37 = @xmath36 ) is chosen , because the size of the old gcs in the galactic gc system ( i.e. , the radius within which most galactic old gcs are located ) is similar to @xmath36 of the dark matter halo in a dynamical model of the galaxy ( bekki et al .",
    "we assume that old mpc formation is truncated completely after @xmath3 and investigate the dependences of the results on @xmath38 .",
    "physical motivation for the truncation of gc formation is described later .",
    "secondly , we follow gc particles formed before @xmath3 until @xmath4 and thereby derive locations @xmath39 and velocities @xmath40 of gcs at @xmath4 .",
    "we then identify virialized halos at @xmath4 with the fof algorithm and investigate whether each gc is within a halo .",
    "if gcs are found to be within a halo , the mass of the host halo ( @xmath12 ) and physical properties of the gcs are investigated .",
    "if a gc is not in any halo , it is regarded as an intergalactic gc .",
    "the number fraction of these depends on @xmath38 but is typically less than 1 % ( e.g. , @xmath17 0.3 % for @xmath41 ) .",
    "we do nt consider intergalactic gcs further in this current paper .",
    "thus , the present simulations enable us to investigate the physical properties only for old mpcs due to the adopted assumption of collisionless simulations .",
    "the physical properties of mrcs which may form later during dissipative merger events ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ) are not investigated .",
    "we assume that the initial radial profiles of gcss ( @xmath42 ) in subhalos at @xmath3 are the same as those described by the universal `` nfw '' profiles ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) with @xmath43 in their outer parts .",
    "the mean mass of subhalos at @xmath3 in the present simulations is roughly similar to the total mass of dwarf galaxies today .",
    "minniti et al . ( 1996 ) found that the projected ( @xmath44 ) density profiles of gcss in dwarfs is approximated as @xmath45 , which translates roughly to @xmath43 using a canonical conversion formula from @xmath46 into @xmath42 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , the above @xmath47 dependency can be regarded as reasonable .",
    "below we mainly show the fiducial model with @xmath42 similar to the nfw profiles and @xmath48 .",
    "although we base our gc models on observational results of gcss at z=0 , we can not confirm whether the above @xmath42 and @xmath37 values are reasonable for gcss in low - mass subhalos at z @xmath49 6 owing to the lack of observational data for gcss at high redshifts .",
    "although our present results on the @xmath8 relation and the blue tilt at @xmath4 do not depend strongly on the initial distributions of mpcs , structural properties of gcss do depend on the spatial distribution .",
    "for example , if we choose smaller @xmath37 at @xmath3 , the final projected number distributions of gcss becomes more compact .      in order to investigate the mean metallicities of mpcs in galaxy - scale halos at @xmath4",
    ", we need to allocate initial metallicities to all gcs formed before @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that gcs in a halo at @xmath38 have identical metallicities of @xmath1 and that the metallicities are a function of the total stellar mass ( or luminosity ) of the halo .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have found that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 for @xmath52band luminosities in des and de , ns . this relation is similar to @xmath5 discovered by strader et al .",

    "this translates to @xmath55 if gcs follow field stars in dwarfs .",
    "prompted by these theoretical and observational studies , we adopt the following relation at high redshift between [ fe / h ] ( or log @xmath1 ) of mpcs and @xmath2 : @xmath56 }   = { \\alpha}_{\\rm gc } \\times \\log l + { \\beta}_{\\rm gc},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are set to be 0.5 and -6.0 in the present study . we show the models with these values , because they are more consistent with the observed @xmath8 relation .    in order to derive @xmath2 for halos with masses @xmath12 at @xmath4 , we assume a mass - to - light - ratio ( @xmath59 ) dependent on @xmath12 .",
    "recent observational studies based on galaxy luminosity functions for luminous galaxies suggests that @xmath59 depends on @xmath12 as @xmath60 ( marinoni & hudson 2002 ) .",
    "dekel & silk ( 1986 ) proposed that @xmath61 for low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , which can be interpreted as @xmath62 .",
    "these studies suggest that the @xmath12-dependences of @xmath59 are different between low- and high - luminosity galaxies ( see also zaritsky et al .",
    "we thus adopt two different @xmath12-dependent @xmath59 ratios for galaxy - scale halos in the present study . for halos above a threshold halo mass of @xmath63 ,",
    "we adopt the following : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant and the value of @xmath59 at @xmath66 . for halos below a threshold halo mass of @xmath63",
    ", we adopt the following : @xmath67 we assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are reasonable values . since the threshold mass @xmath63 has not yet been so precisely determined by observational studies ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath63 can be a free parameter in our simulations .",
    "we however confirm that this @xmath63 for a reasonable range is not so important as other parameters ( e.g. , @xmath59 dependences ) .",
    "we thus mainly show the results of the models with @xmath69 .    in calculating @xmath1 from @xmath2 at @xmath3 , we need to derive @xmath2 from @xmath12 at @xmath3 .",
    "it is , however , observationally unclear what a reasonable @xmath12-dependent @xmath59 is for halos at @xmath3 .",
    "we accordingly investigate two extreme cases : one is that @xmath70 for all halos at @xmath3 and the other is that the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath59 is the same between @xmath4 ( equations 2 and 3 ) and @xmath3 .",
    "the total _ stellar _ mass ( @xmath71 ) of a halo is estimated from @xmath12 by using the adopted @xmath12-dependent @xmath59 and the following stellar - mass - to - light - ratio ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is highly likely that @xmath12-dependences of @xmath59 are different between different redshifts , because of ( i ) evolution ( e.g. , aging ) of stellar populations with different ages and metallicities and ( ii ) evolution of baryonic mass fraction . although observational studies on the redshift evolution of the `` fundamental plane '' of early type galaxies ( e.g. , van de ven et al .",
    "2003 ) have provided some clues to stellar population evolution it remains observationally unclear whether evolution of baryonic mass fraction is seen in galaxies : kinematical data sets for precisely estimating total masses of galaxies are currently unavailable for very high-@xmath73 galaxies .",
    "the present models , which do not allow us to make explicit predictions on redshift evolution of @xmath59 , have difficulties to determine which of the above two is responsible for the possible redshift evolution in @xmath12-dependences of @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore do not intend to discuss the origin of the redshift evolution in @xmath12-dependences of @xmath59 in the present paper .",
    "the stellar population synthesis models by vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a salpeter imf show that @xmath72 in the @xmath74-band for stellar populations with [ fe / h ] = @xmath75 ( 0.0 ) is 0.22 ( 0.39 ) for 0.5 gyr and 2.03 ( 4.84 ) for 12.6 gyr .",
    "although @xmath72 depends strongly on age and metallicity of the stellar population , we use a constant @xmath72 of 1 for all halos because of the lack of information on stellar populations in the simulated galaxy - scale halos . a discussion on the dependences on @xmath72 is given in appendix b.    given",
    "the fact that most of the virialized halos at @xmath38 are of low - mass ( @xmath76 ) then the low - metallicities used to derive @xmath72 should be reasonable .",
    "we adopt @xmath77 , which is the average value between 0.5 and 12.6 gyrs in metal - poor stellar populations _ both _ for @xmath38 and @xmath4 for halos with different masses .",
    "although this adoption is more idealized , it helps us to derive more clearly the evolution of the @xmath78 relation between @xmath38 and @xmath4 without having complicated dependences of @xmath72 on ages and metallicities of stars in halos ( that can not be modeled directly in the present study ) .",
    "if we adopt a higher @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xmath79 ) , the simulated @xmath78 relation at @xmath4 is shifted to lower metallicities for a given stellar mass but with the same relation slope .",
    "the luminosity function of gcs has been observationally suggested to be universal and have the following form ( e.g. , harris 1991 ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant , @xmath82 = @xmath83 , and @xmath84 mag ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "we adopt this luminosity function and allocate luminosities to gc particles by generating random numbers for @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath86 @xmath88 .",
    "we note that our results are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath82 or @xmath89 .",
    "previous studies have suggested that stellar galactic nuclei ( gn ) in nucleated low - mass galaxies might be observed as very massive gcs after the host galaxy of the gn is destroyed during merging with , and accretion onto , more massive galaxies ( e.g. , zinnecker et al . 1988 ; freeman 1993 ; bassino et al .",

    "we thus adopt the following relation between the total masses of gn ( @xmath91 ) and the total stellar masses of their hosts @xmath71 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is considered to be a free parameter in the present study .",
    "recent observations of stellar populations of sgn in nearby galaxies suggest that gn have a significant contribution from young stellar populations and thus suggest that gn are growing with time ( e.g. , walcher et al .",

    "recent cosmological simulations have demonstrated that truncation of gc formation by some physical mechanism ( e.g. , reionization ) is necessary to explain the very high specific frequency ( @xmath103 ) in cluster ellipticals , structural properties of the galactic old stars and gcs , and the mass - dependent @xmath103 trend ( santos 2003 ; bekki 2005 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ; rhode et al .",

    "these diverse gcs structures are due to the differences of merging histories of halos ( e.g. , the number of low - mass subhalos that were virialized before @xmath38 which merged to formed a halo ) .",
    "the mean metallicities and metallicity distribution functions of gcss in galaxies are also diverse depending on their merging histories .    fig .",

    "although the dispersion in [ fe / h ] at @xmath4 is significantly large for a given metallicity bin , the @xmath123 relation at @xmath124 becomes flatter at @xmath4 .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the mean metallicities of mpcs in galaxies correlate with the total masses of their host galaxies and thus with those of dark matter halos .",

    "the dependences of this correlation on @xmath38 are given in appendix a.    fig .",
    "3 shows that the initially steep @xmath8 relation at @xmath124 becomes significantly flatter at @xmath4 due to hierarchical merging of low - mass galaxies formed at high @xmath73 .",

    "3 demonstrates that the observed @xmath8 relation ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) at @xmath4 can be reasonably well reproduced by the model with an initial @xmath8 relation of @xmath126 at @xmath124 .",
    "we find that such a steep initial @xmath8 relation at @xmath38 is indispensable for reproducing the very flat yet significant correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 at @xmath4 .",
    "the flattening of the initial @xmath8 relation can be seen also in models with different @xmath38 ( see appendix c )    figs . 4 and 5 show why the initial steep @xmath8 relation becomes flatter during the hierarchical growth of galaxies .",
    "4 shows that the final ( @xmath127 ) mean metallicity of the mpcs in a galaxy with @xmath128 is lower ( @xmath129 ) than the initial mean metallicity ( @xmath130 ) of its progenitor low - mass halo with @xmath131 , which is the most massive halo among those forming this galaxy at @xmath124 .",
    "this galaxy grows via merging and accretion of 74 low - mass halos , all with gcss of different metallicities between @xmath124 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the mpcs in the accreted `` building blocks '' are metal - poor , the metallicity of the gcs in the final galaxy is lower than that of the gcs of its progenitor halo .",
    "there is thus a decrease in the mean metallicities of gcss during galaxy evolution between @xmath38 and @xmath4 which is driven by merging and accretion of low - mass halos and their lower metallicity gcss .",
    "5 shows the differences in mean metallicities ( @xmath1 ) between gcss in galaxies at @xmath4 and those in their progenitor low - mass halos at @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath132 ) . although the dispersion in @xmath133 is quite large in more massive galaxies , the absolute values of @xmath133 are significantly larger in more massive galaxies .",
    "this means that more massive galaxies at @xmath4 have experienced a larger number of merging and accretion events of lower - mass halos with lower @xmath1 , so that the final @xmath1 at @xmath4 is lower .",
    "low - mass galaxies at @xmath4 , on the other hand , have not experienced so many mergers and accretion events that act to increase their masses and decrease their @xmath134 . such galaxies are of low - mass because they have only grown slightly through merging / accretion since their virialization at @xmath124 . as a result of this and forming relatively many gcs in the progenitor halo ,",
    "their @xmath1 does not change so much from their original values at @xmath124 .",
    "thus the mass - dependence of @xmath133 is the main reason for the flattening of the @xmath8 relation between @xmath38 and @xmath4 .",
    "6 shows that if the @xmath135 ratios in galaxies are variable at @xmath124 and @xmath4 , then the simulated @xmath136 relation is not a good fit to the observed one .",
    "these results , combined with those in fig .",
    "3 , demonstrate that the model with a constant @xmath135 at @xmath124 can better reproduce the observed flat @xmath8 relation for a given initial @xmath8 relation .",
    "given the fact that both the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath135 and @xmath8 relation at @xmath124 are observationally unclear , there are two possible interpretations for the derived steeper @xmath8 relation at @xmath4 in the variable @xmath135 models .",
    "one possibility is that the variable @xmath135 is more reasonable , and thus the initial @xmath8 relation at @xmath124 should be much flatter than the adopted one of @xmath126 .",
    "the other possibility is that a constant @xmath135 is more reasonable and the observed @xmath12-dependence of @xmath135 at @xmath4 is achieved during galaxy evolution between @xmath124 and @xmath4 .",

    "a possible exception was ngc 4472 .",

    "( 2006 ) . in each of these acs studies the mrcs showed no corresponding trend .",

    "here we have demonstrated that luminous mpcs in more massive galaxies show metallicity - luminosity relations in that brighter gcs have redder colors @xmath173 a trend qualitatively similar to the observed blue tilts . in our simulations",
    "the reason for the `` simulated blue tilts '' is that luminous mpcs originate from stellar galactic nuclei ( gn ) of the more massive nucleated galaxies with a luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "the present study thus suggests that galaxies which experienced a larger number of accretion / merging events of nucleated low - mass galaxies are more likely to show a blue tilt .",
    "since the frequency of accretion / merging events is generally higher in more massive galaxies , the blue tilts are more likely to be present in high luminosity than low luminosity galaxies .",
    "thus not all galaxies are expected to have blue tilts .",
    "since these simulated gcss are composed both of stripped normal gcs ( with no initial mass - metallicity relation ) and of stripped gn with a mass - metallicity relation , their detection in observational data may depend on their relative numbers .",
    "although we find clear blue tilts in our simulations , it is not clear what role stripped galactic nuclei play in the observed blue tilts to date .",
    "for example , spitler et al . ( 2006 ) find the blue tilt is not simply a feature of luminous mpcs but seems to extend down to luminosity function as far as is measurable .",
    "furthermore the mpc luminosity function is well fit by a standard gaussian , or t@xmath174 function , even at the luminous end .",
    "thus the tilt does not appear to be due to an additional population but rather a ` tilting ' of the existing mpc system .",
    "more deep data on a variety of systems are required to confirm these trends .",
    "a direct comparison between simulations and observational data needs to account for many factors , such as the number of gn vs bona fide gcs , contamination rates , the presence of dust and measurement errors ( which tend to cause spreads in both magnitude and colour ) .    the observed colors and metallicities of gn in dwarfs ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 ; mieske et al 2006 ) appear to suggest most gn can not be metal - rich clusters as they have lower metallicities .",
    "the apparent absence of a mrc color - magnitude relation may therefore reflect the fact that most mrcs do not originate from gn .",
    "our simulated blue tilt , due to the stripped nuclei of ( defunct ) low - mass galaxies , is one of many possible scenarios for the origin of the blue tilt .",

    "although this is due partly to the way we estimate @xmath11 for a gcs in our models , the significant difference between the exponents of the @xmath115 terms between the virial and the simulated relations strongly suggests that the deviation has a physical meaning .",

    "a1 shows that the initially steep @xmath123 relation at @xmath186 becomes flatter in the model with @xmath187 , though the degree of the flattening is less significant in this model than in the model with @xmath104 .",
    "this reflects the fact that galaxies experienced a smaller number of galaxy merging ( which can flatten the @xmath123 relation ) between @xmath3 and @xmath4 in this model .",
    "a2 shows that the @xmath123 relation is almost flat in the model with @xmath188 , which means that hierarchical merging of low - mass galaxies between @xmath38 and @xmath4 almost completely erases out the original steep @xmath123 relation : this simulated @xmath123 at @xmath4 is inconsistent with the observed one .",
    "these results shown in figs . a1 and a2 thus suggest that the degree of the flattening in the @xmath123 relation depends on @xmath38 in the sense that models with earlier truncation of gc formation show the larger degree of the flattening .",
    "the absence of low - mass galaxies with gcs for @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) in the model with @xmath188 is inconsistent with observations .",
    "b1 shows that the original @xmath8 relation becomes significantly flatter between @xmath38 and @xmath4 in the model with @xmath191 .",
    "the locations of galaxies on the @xmath71-@xmath1 plane are shifted to the righter directions owing to the larger stellar masses of galaxies in this model with higher @xmath72 . as a result of this ,",
    "the simulated @xmath1 for a given @xmath71 is slightly smaller than the observed one .",
    "the change in @xmath72 however does not change the final slope in the @xmath8 relation in comparison with the model with @xmath77 .",
    "the flattening of the @xmath8 relation between @xmath38 and @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath72 , as long as we adopt assumptions of ( i ) a constant @xmath72 at @xmath3 and ( ii ) an initial @xmath8 relation of @xmath126 .",
    "this means that if we adopt a slightly higher value of @xmath192 for the higher @xmath72 model , the observed relation can be better reproduced under the above assumptions .",
    "thus high values of @xmath192 are required in the models with higher @xmath72 and with the above assumptions for the observation to be well reproduced .",
    "figs . c1 and c2 show the simulated @xmath78 relations ( thus @xmath8 relations for the fixed @xmath72 ratios ) for the models with @xmath38 = 6 and 15 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from these figures and fig .",
    "5 that the model with @xmath104 can better reproduce the observed flat @xmath8 relation ( or @xmath78 one ) . the model with @xmath188",
    "shows the @xmath8 relation flatter than the observed one whereas the model with @xmath187 shows the steeper one . in the model with @xmath188 ( @xmath187 ) , a larger ( smaller ) number of merger events for",
    "a longer ( shorter ) time scale between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can flatten the original @xmath8 relation at @xmath3 to a larger ( smaller ) extent .",
    "this is the essential reason why the simulated @xmath8 relation depends on @xmath38 .",
    "thus the growth of galaxies via hierarchical merging / accretion of low - mass halos with and without mpcs between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can flatten the original @xmath8 at @xmath3 owing to merging / accretion of mpcs with different metallicities . if @xmath38 corresponds to the epoch of reionization ( @xmath193 ) and it is determined from future observations , then the results of numerical simulations shown in figs .",
    "6 , c1 , and c2 imply that we can infer the original @xmath8 at @xmath194 by comparing the simulations with the observed @xmath8 at @xmath4 .",
    "d1 shows that the dynamical correlations are different between different @xmath38 , in particular , for @xmath71-dependences of @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath10 is steeper for higher @xmath38 whereas the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath11 is not so different between different @xmath38 .",
    "the slope in the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath115 is negative for @xmath104 and 15 and positive for @xmath187 .",
    "the derived differences in the @xmath71-dependences of dynamical properties of gcss between different @xmath38 suggest that future observational studies on the @xmath71-dependences can provide some constraints on @xmath38 .",
    "structural properties of gcss have been suggested to provide constraints on @xmath38 ( santos 2003 ; bekki 2005 ; moore et al .",
    "the present study suggested that if ( i ) the adopted @xmath8 relation at @xmath3 ( @xmath126 ) is reasonable and realistic and ( ii ) @xmath135 does not depend on galaxy masses at @xmath3 , the observed @xmath8 relation at @xmath4 could also provide constraints on @xmath38 .",
    "it is therefore an important observational test whether @xmath38 derived from the observed @xmath71-dependences is consistent with @xmath38 derived from the structural and chemical properties of gcss .",
    "we adopted an assumption of a universal gc mass ( luminosity ) function with the same lower ( @xmath195 ) and upper ( or luminosity ) mass cut off ( @xmath196 ) for all halos in the present study . since recent observations have suggested a possible maximum mass @xmath197 of star clusters in galaxies ( e.g. , gieles et al .",
    "2006 ) and correlations between @xmath197 and physical properties of their host galaxies , such as star formation rates ( e.g. , larsen & richtler 2000 ) , the above assumption on the fixed @xmath196 could be less realistic .",
    "we thus investigated the models with @xmath198 relations ( i.e. , @xmath199 ) suggested by numerical simulations of kravtsov & gnedin 2005 .",
    "e1 shows the result of the model with @xmath200 and @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "owing to the introduction of the @xmath198 relation , the overall distribution of mpcs on the @xmath151-[fe / h ] in this model appears to be only slightly more similar to the observed blue tilt than the model shown in fig .",
    "the least square fits to the simulation data show that @xmath203}$ ] ( i.e. , @xmath204 ) .",
    "this @xmath204 relation is however still significantly steeper than the observed one of @xmath156 ( harris et al .",
    "although the models with steeper @xmath198 relations can show flatter @xmath205 relations , the simulated dispersions in @xmath151 for given metallicity bins ( in particular , for [ fe / h ] @xmath206 ) are too large to be consistent with observations .",
    "these suggest that the models with @xmath198 relations still miss some important ingredients of gc formation .",
    "we discuss these problems in our forthcoming papers ( bekki et al .",
