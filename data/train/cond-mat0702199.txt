    "the quantum phase transitions between the insulating and metallic state are found to be characterized by the scaling exponent @xmath151 for the diverging localization length .",
    "this value is consistent with that found in previous numerical studies of the two - dimensional metal to insulator transition in the symplectic universality class.@xcite we did not find the value @xmath152 , recently observed by onoda et al .  in ref .",
    ", that was interpreted as the signature of a new universality class at the transition between the @xmath0 quantum spin - hall insulating and the metallic state .",
    "it is important to remember the similarities and differences between our network model and the lattice model studied in ref .  .",
    "common to the two models is that , in the absence of disorder , they support a host @xmath1 quantum spin - hall state ( a host @xmath0 insulator for brevity ) whereby an odd number of kramers doublet edge states cause an accumulation of spin at the edges under an applied electric field .",
    "the crucial difference lies in the spatial correlation of the disorder potential added to the host @xmath0 insulator . on the one hand , in ref .",
    "disorder is introduced as a random on - site potential that has no spatial correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "our network model is obtained by perturbing the host @xmath0 insulator with a spatially smooth disorder potential that breaks the host @xmath0 insulator into droplets of @xmath0 insulators .",
    "the network model can thus be viewed as a coarse - grained effective model for @xmath0 insulating droplets that are weakly coupled through quantum tunneling .    the intrinsic symmetry ( time reversal ) respected by the statistical ensemble of random hamiltonians or scattering matrices is not changed by the range of the spatial correlation of the disorder .",
    "the hypothesis of universality would then suggest that the same critical scaling should be observed at the localization - delocalization transitions in the lattice model of ref .   and in our network model .",
    "the apparent violation of the universality by the two numerical results can be reconciled if one assumes that there is a long crossover length scale beyond which microscopic differences between the two models become irrelevant .",
    "corrections from irrelevant scaling variables may strongly depend on the range of the disorder potential , as in the case of the plateau transition in the second landau level,@xcite and it could well be that the system sizes studied in ref .",
    "were not large enough .",
    "verification of this scenario is left for future work .",
    "the fact that our network model is built out of two chalker - coddington network models coupled in a time - reversal invariant way has important consequences .",
    "criticality in each chalker - coddington network model can be encoded by the field theory of a single ( two - components ) dirac fermion coupled to a random vector potential , a random mass , and a random scalar potential.@xcite it then follows by continuity ( for small enough @xmath33 ) that the two lines of critical points emerging from the chalker - coddington critical point in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] can be encoded by a field theory for two flavors of dirac fermions .",
    "it is their coupling by disorder that prevents the emergence of a time - reversal symmetric and topologically driven quantum critical behavior.@xcite",
