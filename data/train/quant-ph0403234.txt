    "however , as far as the determination of @xmath8 is concerned , the formula ( [ detgammasolution ] ) does not give any reliable estimate .",
    "this results from the fact that , in the experiment , we have to work with small detection efficiencies @xmath85 so that small uncertainties on @xmath86 have much larger influence on @xmath8 than on @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , if we take the derivative of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to @xmath87 , we find , @xmath88 this shows that in our experimental setup , the determinant is about 400 times more sensitive to small uncertainties on @xmath87 than the trace .    in order to gain information on the determinant of the covariance matrix as well as to increase the accuracy of the estimate of its trace , we used the full set of measurements for the different beamsplitter transmittances by performing a maximum - likelihood estimation as introduced in the previous section .",
    "the logarithm of the likelihood function @xmath89 given by eq.([l ] ) was computed from the measured data , the above estimate of the overall detection efficiency @xmath43 , and the values of the transmittance @xmath58 obtained from direct power transmission of the probe beam .",

    "consequently , no reliable estimate of the determinant could be obtained from our experimental data , the log - likelihood maximization method returning essentially a random value between 1 and @xmath91 .",

[ expresult1](a )",
    ", ( b ) , ( c ) , and [ expresult2](b ) take into account the fact that no estimate of the determinant better than the bounds  ( [ constraints ] ) could be obtained by the photon - counting method given the estimate of the trace .",
    "we also tried various other numerical methods - such as least squares inversion - but neither provided a reliable estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "some better insight on the intrinsic difficulty to get an estimate of @xmath8 can be obtained by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eqpj ] ) as @xmath93 it becomes clear that the determinant is linked to the second - order dependence of @xmath94 in the transmittance , while the trace can be directly obtained from the linear dependence of @xmath94 .",
    "the basic difficulty to estimate @xmath8 results from the fact that the relevant information is hidden in terms of order @xmath95 , which are very small for our experimental data given the low values of @xmath43 .",
    "one could then try to increase the overall apd detection efficiency @xmath43 by releasing either the spatial or spectral filtering conditions .",
    "however , from an experimental point of view , this does not seem realistic for several reasons .",
    "first , we would move to a region where the physics become multimode , which is clearly outside the framework of the developed model . in principle",
    ", the photon counting method allows one to check whether the single - mode description of the experiment is appropriate or not .",
    "if only a single mode is detected , then @xmath96 should be a quadratic polynomial in @xmath97 , cfr .",
    "( [ pjpolynom ] ) . more generally , if the detector effectively registers light from @xmath98 modes in a gaussian state , then @xmath96 becomes a polynomial of @xmath99-th order in @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "so , after measuring @xmath101 as a function of @xmath100 one could perform a fitting to determine the minimal number of modes @xmath98 that is necessary for the description of the observed signal . however , a successful application of this technique would require a very high precision in the measurement of @xmath101 and a high @xmath43 .",
    "a second problem with removing the spatial and/or spectral filters is that we would loose any possibility to cross - check our results with classical parametric gain or homodyne measurements .",
    "last , even in the case of no spatial filter and 10  nm spectral filter , the overall apd detection efficiency will remain low given our experimental setup , and we do not expect to gain much according to our numerical simulations of the constraints on the global efficiency presented below .",
    "we have seen that the low apd detection efficiency @xmath43 precludes a reliable estimate of @xmath8 via the photon - counting method .",
    "it is thus important to determine the efficiency @xmath43 that should be attained in order to be able to estimate @xmath8 with acceptably small errors .",
    "more generally , it is interesting to investigate the dependence of the estimation errors on @xmath43 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the experiment for several values of @xmath43 , the other parameters of the simulation being chosen in accordance with the experimental values . in particular , we have assumed a measurement repetition rate @xmath75  khz and a total measurement time @xmath102  s for each transmittance @xmath58 . the total number of measurements for each @xmath58 is then given by @xmath103 .",
    "we have further assumed that measurements were carried out for four different transmittances @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and we used the experimentally obtained values @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a typical example ( corresponding to a pump average power of 1.21mw ) .",
    "the determinant and the trace of @xmath2 were estimated from the simulated experimental data with the help of the maximum - likelihood technique described in the preceding section . since the ml estimator is generally biased , we define the deviation of the estimate from the true value as @xmath110 where @xmath111 indicates averaging over an ensemble of experiments . in practice , we simulated 1000 times the whole experiment , from data acquisition to the ml estimation , and we then calculated ( [ sigma ] ) by averaging over the ensemble .",
    "since the total number of measurements @xmath112 was very large , we approximated the binomial distribution of @xmath67 by a normal distribution with the same mean and variance .",
    "besides the statistical fluctuations of @xmath67 and the intrinsic difficulty of estimating @xmath8 at low detection efficiencies , other factors contribute to the estimation errors , namely the uncertainty in the knowledge of @xmath58 and @xmath43 . to isolate the errors stemming from low @xmath43 , we have first assumed that all parameters @xmath58 and @xmath43 are known precisely , hence the statistical fluctuations of @xmath67 are the only source of errors .",
    "the resulting @xmath113 is plotted as circles in fig .",
    "[ directfig4 ] .",

    "the uncertainties of @xmath58 and @xmath43 significantly increase the estimation error for higher @xmath43 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations taking into account that @xmath58 s are known with an uncertainty of @xmath118% , and the relative uncertainty of @xmath43 is @xmath119% which corresponds to the actual experimental situation .",
    "the resulting @xmath113 is plotted as squares in fig .",
    "[ directfig4 ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath113 is much higher than in the previous case , except for the region of very small @xmath43 . to obtain a satisfactorily accurate estimate of @xmath8 with @xmath120 ,",
    "we need @xmath121% .    in order to demonstrate that @xmath122% is indeed sufficient for the whole range of values of the pump power , we have simulated the results of an experiment at @xmath122% for the same values of the pump power as in figs .  [ expresult1 ] and [ expresult2 ] .",

    "[ directfig5 ] which shows the mean estimated values of @xmath8 as well as the resulting error bars .",
    "we find that these estimates are in very good agreement with the true values used in the simulation .",
    "finally , note that our numerical simulations also confirm that the estimate of @xmath7 is very accurate : we have found that @xmath123 even for @xmath43 as low as 1% .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that direct photon - counting detection can be used , instead of homodyning , to evaluate the squeezing and purity of an arbitrary single - mode gaussian state . for the rather generic states that we considered ,",
    "the trace of the covariance matrix can be accurately determined , even with an overall detection efficiency @xmath124 in the percent range , while its determinant ( related to the state purity ) requires a much higher @xmath124 , typically around 50% .    in principle , such efficiencies are well within the reach of silicon photon - counting avalanche photodiodes , but an important problem remains : most sources do not emit single - mode gaussian light , but rather multimode light .",
    "this is not a problem when a homodyne detection is used , because the local oscillator acts as a very efficient single - mode filter . on the other hand ,",
    "a photon counter detects photons in any mode .",
    "therefore , detecting a good approximation of a single mode state requires appropriate spatial and spectral filters , respectively obtained from pinholes and diffraction gratings .",
    "unless a special effort is made , these filters will have a low overall transmission ( a few percent in our experiment ) , and thus the direct detection method will fail to determine the state purity .    in principle , there are various ways for improvement , which are open for further experimental work .",
    "ideally , the source itself should emit single mode light , which might be obtained by appropriate phase - matching conditions in a @xmath125 non - linear crystal . on the filtering side ,",
    "interferometric multidielectric filters provide transmission values which are much higher than standard slits and grating set - ups .",
    "a combination of these various techniques will be probably needed to reach the high overall efficiencies needed for many potential applications .    as a conclusion",
    ", it appears that a broad variety of techniques is available to characterize quantum continuous variables , and that these methods will certainly continue to develop for applications in quantum cryptography , quantum communications , and possibly quantum computing .",
    "perhaps the most appealing application of the photon - counting method is the direct determination of the entanglement of two - mode gaussian states by measuring only the purity of the two - mode state and the marginal purities of the single - mode states on each side @xcite .",
    "all these purities can be determined with the photon counting method using only local measurements .",
    "the distinct feature of this approach is that no interferometric stability is required if one is dealing with squeezed vacuum states , which is the case in many experiments .",
