    "in 1965 , birch , chowla , hall , and schinzel @xcite asked a question which soon became famous:[bchs ]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be two coprime polynomials with complex coefficients ; what is the possible minimum degree of the difference @xmath9 ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is reasonable to suppose that @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same degree and the same leading coefficients .",
    "let us take @xmath12 , @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 .",
    "then the following was conjectured in  @xcite:[init - problem ]    1",
    ".   for @xmath9 one always has @xmath15 .",
    "this bound is sharp : that is , it is attained for infinitely many values of @xmath16 .",
    "the first conjecture was proved the same year by davenport @xcite .",
    "the second one turned out to be much more difficult and remained open for 16 years : in 1981 stothers @xcite showed that the bound is in fact attained not only for infinitely many values of @xmath16 but for all of them .",
    "the above problem may be generalized in various ways .",
    "the following one was considered in 1995 by zannier @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be two partitions of  @xmath18 , @xmath19 and let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two coprime polynomials of degree @xmath18 having the following factorization pattern : @xmath20 in these expressions we consider the multiplicities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 as being given , while the roots @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not fixed , though they must all be distinct . the problem is to find the minimum possible degree of the difference @xmath27 . in his paper , zannier proved the following .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the greatest common divisor of the numbers @xmath29 . if @xmath30 then @xmath31 and this bound is always attained . if , on the other hand , @xmath32 , then a weaker bound @xmath33 is valid , and it is also attained .",
    "[ def : dz - triple ] let @xmath34 $ ] be coprime polynomials with factorization pattern ( [ eq : p - and - q ] ) , @xmath35 , while the degree of the polynomial @xmath36 equals @xmath37 .",
    "then the triple @xmath38 is called a _ davenport ",
    "zannier triple _ , or , in a more concise way , a _",
    "dz - triple_.    the main subject of this paper is a study of dz - triples _ defined over _ @xmath5 , that is , the triples @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a preliminary work is carried out in section  [ sec : dessins ] .",
    "first , we show that bound ( [ eq : main - bound ] ) follows from the riemann ",
    "hurwitz formula for the function @xmath40 .",
    "then we reduce the problem about polynomials to a problem about _ weighted bicolored plane trees_. a weighted bicolored plane tree is a _ plane tree _",
    "( `` plane '' means that the cyclic order of branches around each vertex is fixed ) whose vertices are colored in black and white in such a way that the ends of each edge have opposite colors , and whose _ edges are endowed with positive integral weights_. the _ degree of a vertex _ is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges incident to this vertex .",
    "the sum of the weights of all the edges is called the _ total weight _ of the tree .",
    "we show that a dz - triple with prescribed factorization pattern ( [ eq : p - and - q ] ) exists if and only if there exists a weighted bicolored plane tree of the total weight @xmath41 having @xmath42 black vertices of degrees @xmath43 and @xmath44 white vertices of degrees @xmath45 . as a corollary ,",
    "we give a spectacularly simple proof of stothers s 1981 result for the squares and cubes , namely , the attainability of the lower bound @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , see example  [ ex : stothers ] .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : dessins ] as well as the framework of the whole paper are based on the theory of _ dessins denfants _ ( see , e.g. , chapter  2 of @xcite , or a collection of papers  @xcite , or a recent book  @xcite ) .",
    "this theory establishes a correspondence between simple combinatorial objects , graphs drawn on two - dimensional surfaces , and a vast world of riemann surfaces , algebraic curves , number fields , galois theory , etc .    in section  [ sec :",
    "existence ] we prove the existence theorem for weighted bicolored plane trees .",
    "namely , we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a tree with the above characteristics is inequality ( [ qwert ] ) .",
    "the attainability of bound is deduced from this result . in section 4",
    "we establish bound ( [ no - qwert ] ) and its attainability in the case when inequality is not satisfied .",
    "although bounds and ( [ no - qwert ] ) and their attainability were proved by u.zannier , we reprove these results here for the sake of completeness , and also in order to show how the pictorial language clarifies and simplifies the exposition .",
    "in sections  [ sec : unitrees ] and [ sec : galois ] we study dz - triples defined over @xmath5 .",
    "this case is the most interesting one since by specializing @xmath49 to a rational value one may obtain an important information concerning differences of integers with given factorization patterns .",
    "this subject is actively studied in number - theoretic works : see , for example , a recent paper by beukers and stewart  @xcite ( 2010 ) and the bibliography therein .",
    "our approach here is based on the following corollary of the theory of dessins denfants which gives a sufficient ( though not necessary ) condition for a dz - triple to be defined over @xmath5 : the triple is defined over @xmath5 if there exists _ exactly one _ weighted bicolored plane tree with the degrees of black vertices equal to @xmath43 , and the degrees of white vertices equal to @xmath45 .",
    "we will call such trees _",
    "unitrees_.    in section  [ sec : unitrees ] we prove the main result of the paper , namely , a complete classification of unitrees : see theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "the formulation of this theorem is rather long so we do not enunciate it in the introduction .",
    "we mention only that the class of unitrees consists of ten infinite series of trees and ten sporadic trees which do not belong to the above series .    while the results of section  [ sec : unitrees ] may be considered as conclusive , section  [ sec : galois ] represents only first steps in a far - ranging programme of study of the galois action on weighted plane trees and of combinatorial invariants of this action .",
    "this approach permits to find yet more dz - triples defined over @xmath5 and also to study dz - triples over other number fields .",
    "note that essentially all previously found examples of dz - triples over  @xmath5 correspond either to unitrees or to the trees constructed in section  [ sec : galois ] .",
    "we have also found quite a few new examples of dz - triples .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : further ] we mention some further possible developments of the subject .",
    "this paper deals only with the combinatorial aspect of the whole construction .",
    "the computation of the corresponding dz - triples is postponed to a separate publication ( see @xcite ) since the techniques used for this purpose are very different form the ones used in this paper .",
    "in particular , a great deal of symbolic computations as well as certain polynomial identities are required . for an individual unitree",
    ", the computation of the corresponding dz - triple is a difficult task but the verification of the result is easy . indeed ,",
    "when polynomials @xmath50 ( together with their appropriate factorizations ) are given , it is immediate to observe that their coefficients are rational , and the only thing to verify is that @xmath51 is indeed equal to @xmath4 . the situation becomes significantly more complicated for infinite series of trees since in this case the proof may become rather elaborate .",
    "let @xmath17 be two partitions of @xmath18 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and let @xmath55 $ ] be two polynomials of degree @xmath18 with the factorizations @xmath56 we suppose all @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 to be distinct .",
    "let the difference @xmath36 have the following factorization : @xmath60 our goal is to minimize @xmath61 ; obviously , @xmath62 consider the following rational function of degree @xmath18 : @xmath63 note that @xmath64    [ def : crit - value ] a point @xmath65 is called _ critical value _ of a rational function @xmath66 if the equation @xmath67 has multiple roots .",
    "the expressions written above for the function @xmath68 provide us with at least three critical values of @xmath66 :    * @xmath69 , provided that not all @xmath21 are equal to 1 ; * @xmath70 , provided that not all @xmath22 are equal to 1 ; and * @xmath71 , if only we do not consider the trivial case @xmath72 ; if @xmath73 then @xmath66 has a multiple pole at infinity .    denote @xmath74 the other critical values of @xmath66 , if there are any , and let @xmath75 be the number of preimages of  @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; by the definition of a critical value , @xmath78 .",
    "[ lem : r ] the number @xmath79 of distinct roots of the polynomial @xmath51 is @xmath80    in fact , equality ( [ eq : r ] ) is a particular case of the riemann ",
    "hurwitz formula , but for the sake of completeness we give its proof here .",
    "[ [ proof . ] ] proof .",
    "+ + + + + +    let us draw a _ star - tree _ with the center at 0 and with its rays going to the critical values @xmath81 , see figure  [ fig : star ] .",
    "considered as a map on the sphere , this tree has @xmath82 vertices , @xmath83 edges , and a single outer face with its `` center '' at @xmath84 .",
    "now let us take the preimage of this tree under  @xmath66 .",
    "we will get a graph drawn on the preimage sphere which has @xmath85 edges since each edge is `` repeated '' @xmath18 times in the preimage .",
    "its vertices are the preimages of the points @xmath86 , so their number is equal to @xmath87 .    what occurs to the faces ?",
    "if we puncture at @xmath84 the single open face in the image sphere , we get a punctured disk without any ramification points inside .",
    "the only possible unramified covering of a punctured open disk is a disjoint collection of punctured disks ; their number is equal to the number of poles of @xmath66 , namely , @xmath88 ( @xmath79 roots of  @xmath51 and @xmath84 ) . inserting a point into each puncture",
    "we get @xmath88 simply connected open faces in the preimage sphere . the fact that they are simply connected implies that the graph drawn on the preimage sphere is connected .",
    "thus , the preimage of our star - tree is a plane map .",
    "what remains is to apply euler s formula : @xmath89 which leads to .",
    "@xmath90    notice that in order to prove lemma [ lem : r ] , instead of the tree of figure  [ fig : star ] , we could take any other plane map with vertices at the critical values ( see e.g. the proof of proposition [ prop : thom ] below ) .",
    "we have @xmath91    the proof follows from ( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : r > r ] ) .",
    "@xmath90    note that @xmath61 can not be negative ; therefore , when @xmath92 the latter bound can not be attained . in this case",
    "one can attain the bound @xmath93 , that is , the polynomial @xmath51 can be made equal to a constant .",
    "this situation is studied in more detail in section  [ sec : weak - bound ] .",
    "equation provides us with guidelines of how to get the minimum degree of  @xmath51 .",
    "[ prop : lower - bound ] bound is attained if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath94 . *",
    "the number @xmath95 of the critical values of @xmath66 other than @xmath96 , is equal to zero , so that the sum @xmath97 in the right - hand side of   is eliminated altogether . the tree of figure  [ fig : star ]",
    "is then reduced to merely the segment @xmath98 $ ] . *",
    "all the roots of @xmath51 are simple , that is , @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 .",
    "another formulation of the same condition : the partition @xmath101 , @xmath102 , which corresponds to the multiplicities of the poles , has the form of a hook : @xmath103 .    the conditions which imply the existence of such a function  @xmath66 will be obtained in section  [ sec : existence ] .",
    "considering rational functions with only three critical values brings us into the framework of the theory of _",
    "dessins denfants_. here we give a brief summary of this theory ( only in a planar setting ) ; the missing details , proofs , and bibliography can be found , for example , in  @xcite , chapter 2 .",
    "a rational function @xmath104 is called _ belyi function _ if it does not have critical values outside the set @xmath105 .",
    "for such a function , the tree considered in the proof of lemma  [ lem : r ] is reduced to the segment @xmath98 $ ] .",

    "dessin_.    the dessin @xmath106)$ ] is a connected graph drawn on the sphere , and its edges do not intersect outside the vertices .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 may also be considered as a plane map .",
    "this map has a bipartite structure : black vertices are preimages of @xmath108 , and white vertices are preimages of  @xmath109 .",
    "the degrees of the black vertices are equal to the multiplicities of the roots of the equation @xmath110 , and the degrees of the white ones are equal to the multiplicities of the roots of the equation @xmath111 .",
    "the sum of the degrees in both cases is equal to @xmath112 , which is also the number of edges .",
    "the map @xmath107 being bipartite , the number of edges surrounding each face is even .",
    "it is convenient , in defining the face degrees , to divide this number by two .",
    "[ def : face - degree ] we say that _ an edge is incident to a face _ if , while remaining inside this face and making a circuit of it in the positive ( trigonometric ) direction , we follow the edge from its black end toward the white one .",
    "thus , only half of the edges surrounding a face are incident to it .",
    "moreover , each edge is incident to exactly one face .",
    "the _ degree of a face _ is equal to the number of edges incident to it .    according to this definition and to the remarks preceding it , every edge is incident to one black vertex , to one white vertex , and to one face .",
    "the sum of the face degrees is equal to @xmath112 .",
    "inside each face there is a single pole of  @xmath66 , and the multiplicity of this pole is equal to the degree of the face .",
    "the triple @xmath113 of partitions @xmath114 which correspond to the degrees of the black vertices , of the white vertices , and of the faces of a dessin , is called a _",
    "passport _ of the dessin .",
    "[ def : comb - orbit ] a set of the dessins having the same passport is called a _ combinatorial orbit _ corresponding to this passport .",
    "the construction which associates a map to a belyi function works also in the opposite direction .",
    "two bicolored plane maps are _ isomorphic _ if there exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the sphere which transforms one map into the other , respecting the colors of the vertices .",
    "let @xmath115 be a bicolored map on the sphere .",
    "then , the sphere may be endowed with a complex structure , thus becoming the riemann complex sphere , and a representative of the isomorphism class of @xmath115 can be drawn as a dessin  @xmath107 obtained via a belyi function .",
    "the following statement is a particular case of the classical riemann s existence theorem :    [ prop : belyi - exist ] for every bicolored plane map @xmath115 there exists a dessin @xmath107 isomorphic to @xmath115 , that is , @xmath106)$ ] where @xmath66 is a belyi function .",
    "the function @xmath116 is unique up to a linear fractional transformation of the variable @xmath49 .    of course , when we draw a map we do not respect the specific geometric form of the corresponding dessin .",
    "we are content with the fact that such a dessin exists .",
    "now proposition  [ prop : lower - bound ] may be reformulated in purely combinatorial terms :    [ prop : attain ] the lower bound is attained if and only if there exists a bicolored plane map with the passport @xmath113 in which the partitions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given , and @xmath117 has the form @xmath118 where @xmath109  is repeated @xmath119 times .    in geometric terms , all the faces of our map except the outer one must be of degree  1 . recall that the _ number _ of faces , which is equal to @xmath88 , is prescribed by euler s formula .",
    "[ ex : stothers ] let us look once again at the problem posed by birch et al . in @xcite ( see page  ) . in order to show that if @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath9 , then the lower bound @xmath120 is attained , we must construct a map with the following properties : all its black vertices are of degree  3 ; all its white vertices are of degree  2 ; and all its finite faces are of degree 1 .    in order to simplify our pictures we sometimes use the following convention .    [",
    "con : without - white ] when all the white vertices are of degree 2 , it is convenient , in order to simplify a graphical representation of such maps , to draw only black vertices and to omit the white ones , considering them as being implicit .",
    "in such a picture , a line connecting two black vertices contains an invisible white vertex in its middle , and is thus not an edge but a union of two edges .",
    "the construction of the maps we need to solve the above problem about @xmath121 is trivial : first we draw a tree with all internal nodes being of degree  3 , and then attach loops to its leaves : see figure  [ fig : stothers ] .",
    "we see in this example a remarkable efficiency of the pictorial representation of problems concerning polynomials .",
    "if this representation was known in  1965 , the proof of the conjecture would have taken 16  minutes instead of 16  years .",
    "as it was told in proposition  [ prop : belyi - exist ] , a belyi function @xmath122 corresponding to a dessin is defined up to a linear fractional transformation of @xmath49 . in this family of equivalent belyi functions",
    "it is always possible to find one whose coefficients are algebraic numbers .",
    "if we act simultaneously on all the coefficients of such a function by an element of the _ absolute galois group _ @xmath123 , that is , by an automorphism @xmath124 of the field  @xmath125 of algebraic numbers , or , in other words , if we replace all the coefficients @xmath25 of @xmath66 by their algebraically conjugate numbers @xmath126 , we obtain once again a belyi function .",
    "furthermore , one can prove that in such a way the action of @xmath123 on belyi functions descends to an action on dessins .",
    "there exist many combinatorial invariants of this action , the first and the simplest of them being the passport of the dessin .",
    "thus , a combinatorial orbit ( see definition  [ def : comb - orbit ] ) may constitute a single galois orbit , or may further split into a union of several galois orbits .",
    "every combinatorial orbit is finite , and therefore every galois orbit is also finite .",
    "one of the most important notions concerning the galois action on dessins is that of the field of moduli .",
    "let @xmath107 be a dessin , and let @xmath127 be its stabilizer .",
    "since the orbit @xmath107 is finite , the group @xmath128 is a subgroup of finite index in @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the maximal normal subgroup of @xmath123 contained in @xmath128 . according to the galois correspondence between subgroups of @xmath123 and algebraic extensions of @xmath5",
    ", there exists a number field @xmath130 corresponding to @xmath131 .",
    "this field is called the _ field of moduli _ of the dessin @xmath107 . by construction ,",
    "this field is unique : a dessin can not have two different fields of moduli .    below we list some properties of the fields of moduli .",
    "let @xmath132 be an orbit of the galois action on dessins .",
    "* the field of moduli @xmath130 is the same for all the elements of the orbit . *",
    "the degree of @xmath130 as an extension of @xmath5 is equal to @xmath133 . * the coefficients of belyi functions corresponding to the dessins",
    "@xmath134 , if they are chosen as algebraic numbers , always belong to a finite extension @xmath135 of  @xmath130 . *",
    "the action of the group @xmath123 on the orbit @xmath136 coincides with the action of @xmath137 . *",
    "the action of @xmath138 on belyi functions may change a position of a dessin @xmath134 on the complex sphere but does not change its combinatorial structure ; in other words , as a map , the dessin in question remains the same .    in the absolute majority of cases",
    "the situation is much simpler : the field of moduli of an orbit is the smallest number field to which the coefficients of the corresponding belyi functions belong .",
    "however , in some specially constructed examples we need a larger field  @xmath139 to be able to find belyi functions . there exists a simple _ sufficient condition _ which ensures that the coefficients do belong to @xmath130 , see @xcite : this condition is the existence of a _ bachelor_.    [ def : bachelor ] a _ bachelor _ is a black vertex ( a white vertex ; a face ) such that there is no other black vertex ( no other white vertex ; no other face ) of the same degree .",
    "[ rem : bachelor ] if a dessin contains several bachelors then up to three of them can be placed at rational points , that is , at points in @xmath140 , and this will not prevent the belyi function for the dessin in question to be defined over the field of moduli .    for the dessins we study in this paper",
    "a bachelor always exists : it is the outer face ( since all the other faces are of degree  1 ) .",
    "recalling that the degree of @xmath130 is equal to the size of the orbit we may conclude the following :    summarizing what was stated above we may affirm the following :    [ prop : in - q ] if for a given passport @xmath113 , where the partition  @xmath117 is of the form @xmath118 , there exists a unique bicolored plane map , then there exists a corresponding belyi function with rational coefficients , and therefore there also exists a dz - triple with rational coefficients .    note that proposition  [ prop : attain ] , which concerns the existence , is of the `` if and only if '' type , while proposition  [ prop : in - q ] , which concerns the definability over @xmath5 , provides only an `` if''-type condition .",

    "we have @xmath456 so the white vertices of the dessin @xmath443 ( which are not shown explicitly in figure  [ fig : composition ] ) are the roots of @xmath457 , that is , they are equal to @xmath458 .",
    "now , the critical values of the polynomial @xmath459 that is , the values of @xmath287 at the roots of @xmath460 , are equal to exactly @xmath458 .",
    "therefore , the composition @xmath461 is once again a belyi function , and all its poles except infinity are simple .",
    "the corresponding dessin is shown in figure  [ fig : composition-2 ] .",
    "it is obvious that the dessin @xmath462 is not the only one having the passport @xmath463 .",

    "nevertheless , the dessin thus obtained is defined over @xmath5 by construction .",
    "now the dessins @xmath448 and @xmath462 , being defined over @xmath5 , may themselves serve for a similar construction : if , for example , @xmath400 is a polynomial with coefficients in @xmath5 whose critical values are vertices of @xmath462 , then the function @xmath464 is a belyi function corresponding to a dessin @xmath465 , all of whose finite faces are small . in such a composition , only @xmath66 has to be a belyi function while the subsequent terms may have more than three critical values .",
    "the group of the orientation preserving automorphisms of a plane tree is always cyclic .",
    "if it is @xmath466 then the belyi function for the corresponding map is @xmath467 where @xmath66 is the belyi function for the map corresponding to a single branch of the tree ( the vertex of this branch , which will become the center of the symmetric tree , must be put to the origin ) . among the unitrees classified in section  [ sec :",
    "unitrees ] , the trees @xmath384 and and @xmath51 are symmetric ( of order 3 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "some elements of the infinite series may also be symmetric ( for special values of parameters ) .",
    "we leave it to the reader to see that the series @xmath131 and @xmath286 are compositions ( although the composition in this case is not reduced to a rotational symmetry ) , and that a multiplication of all the weights of the edges of a tree by a factor @xmath184 can be represented as a composition with the following belyi function : @xmath468      [ def : primitive ] a permutation group of degree @xmath18 acting on a set @xmath469 , @xmath470 , is called _ imprimitive _ if the set @xmath469 can be subdivided into @xmath95 disjoint _ blocks _ @xmath471 of equal size @xmath472 , where @xmath473 , such that an image of a block under the action of any element of the group is once again a block . a permutation group which is not imprimitive",

    "its monodromy group is imprimitive .",
    "thus , a covering which is not a composition has a primitive monodromy group .",
    "however , in a vast majority of cases this group is equal to either @xmath474 or @xmath475 , for a very simple reason : a permutation group generated by a randomly chosen pair of permutations is @xmath474 or @xmath475 with a probability close to  1 .",
    "this is why special groups are of a particular interest : since _ the monodromy group is a galois invariant _ , such a group gives an additional invariant in the absence of the composition .    in the case of weighted trees ,",
    "that is , in the case of coverings realized by belyi functions with all poles except one being simple , the monodromy group must contain a permutation of the cycle structure @xmath476 : it is the monodromy permutation corresponding to a loop around infinity on the riemann sphere .",
    "motivated by our study of weighted trees , gareth a. jones classified all special permutation groups containing such a permutation , see @xcite ( 2012 ) .",
    "in particular , it is shown that in all such cases @xmath477 .",
    "this property is based on two results .",
    "the first is an old theorem by jordan  ( 1871 )  @xcite stating that a primitive group containing a permutation with the cycle structure @xmath476 is @xmath478-transitive .",
    "the second is the complete list of multiply transitive groups : it is based on the classification theorem of finite simple groups .",
    "the classification due to jones looks as follows ( we use standard notation for projective , cyclic and affine groups and for the mathieu groups ) :    [ th : jones ] let @xmath335 be a primitive permutation group of degree @xmath18 not equal to @xmath474 or @xmath475 .",

    "[ ex : special ] there are six weighted trees of degree @xmath509 with the passport @xmath510 .",

    "the other trees form a single galois orbit over a field of degree  5 .    in order to establish that the group in question is indeed @xmath512",
    "we may proceed as follows .",
    "first , we draw the bicolored map represented by this tree , as it is done in figure  [ fig : primitive-1 ] , right . then , we label the edges of the map and write down two permutations : the first one represents the cyclic order of the edges around its black vertices in the counterclockwise direction , while the second one represents the cyclic order of the edges around their white vertices in the same direction . in our case",

    "for the other five trees with the same passport the same maple package shows that the size of their monodromy group is @xmath524 , so the group in question is  @xmath511 .",

    "there are five trees with the passport @xmath525 .",
    "one of them is symmetric and therefore forms a galois orbit containing a single element and thus defined over @xmath5 .",
    "three trees have the monodromy group  @xmath511 ; they form a cubic galois orbit .",
    "finally , the remaining tree shown in figure  [ fig : primitive-2 ] has the monodromy group @xmath512 .",
    "therefore , it forms a galois orbit in itself and is thus defined over  @xmath5 .      a dual to a map is usually constructed as follows .",
    "first , one puts a new vertex inside every face of the initial map : this vertex is called `` center '' of the face . then , the centers of the adjacent faces are connected by edges in such a way that every edge of the initial map is crossed in its `` middle point '' by a new edge .",
    "a dual of a dual is the initial map .    for the _ bicolored maps _ a specific variant of the above construction",
    "is used , when only black vertices are considered as vertices , while the white vertices play the role of the edge midpoints .",
    "an association is thus made between the faces of the initial map and _ black vertices _ of the dual map .",
    "the white vertices belong to both maps .",
    "more exactly , a center of a face is connected by edges with all the white verices lying on the border of the face : see an example in figure  [ fig : dual ] where the initial map is shown in an unbroken line , and its dual , in a dashed line ; the black vertices of the dual map are designated by the little squares .    from the point of view of belyi functions , if @xmath122 is a belyi function for the initial map then @xmath526 is a belyi function for its dual .",
    "indeed , @xmath527 interchanges 0 and @xmath84 while leaving 1 untouched .",
    "therefore , the former poles become roots ( i.e. , black vertices ) , and vice versa .    [",
    "def : autodual ] a bicolored map is called _ self - dual _ if it is isomorphic to its dual map .    of course",
    ", the fact that a map is self - dual does not mean that @xmath528 where @xmath66 is its belyi function .",

    "the self - duality is an invariant of the galois action : if a function satisfies an algebraic relation while the other function does not satisfy the same relation , they can not belong to the same galois orbit .",
    "a weighted tree represents a map whose all faces except one are of degree  1 .",
    "therefore , its dual map must have all its black vertices except one being of degree  1 .",
    "this can only happen if the dual map corresponds to a weighted tree of diameter  4 : it has a black vertex of a degree greater than  1 ( its central vertex ) , while all its black leaves are of degree  1 .",
    "therefore , if we are interested in self - dual maps which correspond to weighted trees then we must consider only the trees of diameter  4 .",
    "the condition on the branches of such trees in order for them to be dual to each other is shown in figure  [ fig : dual - branches ] .",

    "therefore , for them the self - duality can not serve as an additional galois invariant leading to a splitting of the combinatorial orbit into two ( or more ) galois orbits .",
    "the world of dessins denfants is rich with various specific cases .",
    "let us consider , for example , the set of dessins shown in figure  [ fig : zannier-5 ] .",
    "they constitute a combinatorial orbit for the passport @xmath543 where @xmath544 , @xmath545 , and @xmath546 .",
    "we might navely suppose that this combinatorial orbit also constitutes a galois orbit ; if this were the case , this orbit would be defined over a field of degree  4 ( since it has four elements ) . however , the reality is more complicated and , in fact , more exciting .",
    "namely : the dessin @xmath517 is the only one having a rotational symmetry of order  3 around a black vertex .",
    "therefore , the singleton @xmath547 constitutes a galois orbit .",
    "two dessins @xmath518 and @xmath516 are the only ones which have rotational symmetry of order  2 , the center being a white vertex ( we recall that the white vertices , being all of degree  2 , are not shown explicitly in the picture ) .",
    "therefore , the set @xmath548 must also be taken apart from the combinatorial orbit .",
    "there are two _ a priori _ possibilities : @xmath518 and @xmath516 may make two galois orbits , both defined over @xmath5 , or they may make a single galois orbit defined over a quadratic field . but any map whose belyi function is defined over a real field must be axially symmetric since it remains invariant under the complex conjugation .",
    "this observation excludes the possibility of two orbits over @xmath5 , and it also excludes a real quadratic field .",
    "we may conclude that the set @xmath548 constitutes a single galois orbit defined over an imaginary quadratic field .",
    "the dessin @xmath184 is not symmetric and does not have any other specific combinatorial features .",
    "but it remains solitary , and therefore it constitutes a galois orbit all by itself . since the orbits @xmath547 and @xmath549 consist of a single element ,",
    "their belyi functions are defined over @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the dessin  @xmath184 is defined over @xmath5 for no other reason than the fact that _ it remains alone after all the other galois orbits are taken away_.    this combinatorial orbit is markworthy for the reason that different authors returned to it , or to some of its elements , many times .",
    "the belyi function for @xmath517 was computed by birch and already appeared in  @xcite ( 1965 ) ; the one for @xmath184 was computed 35  years later by elkies  @xcite ( 2000 ) .",
    "all the four belyi functions were independently computed by shioda @xcite ( 2004 ) . in particular , he found out that the orbit @xmath550 is defined over the field @xmath551 .",
    "shioda had already used as a starting point the above combinatorial orbit ; the other authors have apparently made a `` blind '' search .",
    "our combinatorial approach does not make the computational part of the work any easier .",
    "its advantage is elsewhere .",
    "it consists in the fact that , before any computation , we may be sure of the following .",
    "* there exist exactly four non - equivalent belyi functions with the passport @xmath552 ; here `` non - equivalent '' means that they can not be obtained from one another by a linear fractional change of variables .",
    "* belyi functions corresponding to @xmath517 and @xmath184 are defined over  @xmath5 .",
    "* belyi function corresponding to @xmath517 is a rational function in @xmath553 ( because of the threefold symmetry of the dessin @xmath517 ) .",
    "* belyi functions for the orbit @xmath548 are defined over an imaginary quadratic field .",
    "more examples similar to this one are given below .",
    "all the examples in this section are borrowed from the paper  @xcite by beukers and stewart , which was one of the sources of inspiration for our study . in their paper , the authors consider only the case of powers of polynomials .",
    "namely , they look for polynomials @xmath7 and @xmath8 , _ defined over _ @xmath5 , for which the degree @xmath554 attains its minimum",
    ". the degrees of polynomials in question are @xmath555 , @xmath556 where the parameter @xmath79 may be greater than  1 .",
    "the passport of the corresponding tree is @xmath557 .",
    "the authors find , as we do , several infinite series of dz - triples ( which they call davenport pairs ) , and several sporadic examples .",
    "the first such example , for which @xmath558 , corresponds to our sporadic tree @xmath385 .",
    "the next one , @xmath559 , corresponds to the sporadic tree @xmath2 .",
    "however , the subsequent examples do not correspond to anything we have found up to now .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "it turns out that here we encounter once again the phenomenon that we already explained in section  [ sec : galois - split ] .",
    "there exist two trees corresponding to the passport @xmath560 : they are shown in figure  [ fig : split-7 - 3 ] .",
    "we see that one of the trees is symmetric , with the symmetry of order  3 , while the other one is not .",
    "therefore , this combinatorial orbit splits into two galois orbits , and hence both trees are defined over @xmath5 .",
    "the left - hand one corresponds to the example given in  @xcite .",
    "note that an axial symmetry is not a galois invariant .",
    "the situation for the passports @xmath561 and @xmath562 is similar to the previous one .",
    "for the first passport there are two trees , and one of them is symmetric while the other is not ( see figure  [ fig : split-8 - 3 ] ) ; therefore , both are defined over  @xmath5 . for the second passport",
    "there are three trees ( see figure  [ fig : split-10 - 3 ] ) .",
    "one of them is symmetric with the symmetry of order  2 ; one is symmetric with the symmetry of order  3 ; and one is asymmetric .",
    "therefore , all the three trees are defined over @xmath5 . in both cases `` sporadic '' polynomials given in  @xcite",
    "correspond to asymmetric trees .",
    "the next example given in @xcite corresponds to the passport @xmath563 .",
    "this time , there are three trees : one of them is symmetric with the symmetry of order  2 ; another one is symmetric with the symmetry of order  4 ; the third one is asymmetric .",
    "all the three are therefore defined over @xmath5 .    for the passport @xmath564",
    "there are four trees .",
    "one of them is symmetric with the symmetry of order  5 ; two are symmetric with the symmetry of order  2 ; the remaining tree is asymmetric",
    ". therefore , the combinatorial orbit containing four trees splits into three galois orbits .",
    "the asymmetric tree corresponds to the sporadic example given in @xcite .",
    "we leave it to the reader to draw the trees in question .",
    "[ ex : why ] all known combinatorial invariants fail to explain why the tree with the passport @xmath565 shown in figure  [ fig : why ] is defined over @xmath5 .",
    "the trees corresponding to this passport have 13 edges , so the outer face is of degree 13 , which is prime .",
    "this implies that this tree can not be a composition .",
    "indeed , the outer face of a tree @xmath448 corresponding to a composition @xmath450 can only be ramified over the outer face of the tree @xmath443 , so the degree of the outer face of @xmath448 should be the product of the degree of the outer face of @xmath443 and of @xmath451 .",
    "but 13 can not be a product of two integers .",
    "now , the monodromy group can not be special because of theorem  [ th : jones ] .",
    "the tree can not be self - dual either since its diameter is greater than  4 , etc .    for the moment",
    ", this example is the only one of its kind .",
    "however , one can not hope to reduce the whole body of galois theory to combinatorics .",
    "note nevertheless that the direction of `` diophantine invariants '' ( see the next section ) for the weighted trees remains entirely unexplored .",
    "this example is also borrowed from the paper by beukers and stewart @xcite .",
    "there are no trees in their paper ; the dz - triple corresponding to this example , as well as several other sporadic triples , are found by a brute force computation using grbner bases .",
    "here we discuss briefly some possibilities for further research . to begin with , there are quite a few results known for ordinary trees , which might eventually be generalized to weighted trees",
    ".      it would be very interesting to find an enumerative formula which would count the number of weighted trees having a given passport .",
    "however , this problem may turn out to be very difficult because of the fact that the same passport can be realized by a tree and by a forest .",
    "therefore , an inclusion - exclusion procedure might be necessary , preventing a nice closed formula of goulden ",
    "jackson s type ( see formula ( [ eq : gj ] ) ) .",
    "right now we can prove only much more modest results , namely , enumerate the weighted trees by their weight and number of edges .",
    "we formulate these results without proof .",

    "it would be interesting to produce a complete classification of such cases .",
    "the condition of _ planarity _ , being added to theorem  [ th : jones ] , imposes strong constraints on the numbers of vertices and faces of the corresponding maps . in  @xcite ,",
    "the complete list of ordinary special trees is compiled .",
    "this list is finite : it contains 48  trees , the biggest degree being  31 .",
    "we are pretty sure that the list of special weighted trees is also finite and can be drawn up .",
    "the following two examples may be found in @xcite .",
    "the first one is due to adrianov . consider the following passport for ordinary trees : @xmath590 ( here @xmath591 and @xmath584 ) .",

    "a simple computation shows that these trees are defined over the field @xmath592 where @xmath593 .",

    "both trees become defined over @xmath5 , and this splitting of the combinatorial orbit into two galois orbits does not have any specific combinatorial reason : it is due to certain diophantine relations between vertex degrees . once again",
    ", it would be interesting to extend this scheme to weighted trees .",
    "the next example is maybe the most spectacular one .",
    "we consider the ( ordinary ) trees corresponding to the passport @xmath597 ( here @xmath598 and @xmath584 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that there exist exactly three ordinary trees having this passport .",
    "therefore , they are defined over a cubic extension of @xmath5 ; the cubic polynomial generating this field may be written explicitly .",
    "now , we ask the following question : is it possible that this polynomial has a rational root ?",
    "if yes , then the combinatorial orbit in question will split into two galois orbits , one defined over @xmath5 , and the other one quadratic .",
    "it turns out that the search for polynomials having a rational root can be reduced to the search for rational points on a particular elliptic curve .",
    "the curve in question contains infinitely many rational points .",
    "we have computed the first 11 solutions .",
    "the smallest one corresponds to trees having @xmath599 edges ( @xmath600 , @xmath601 ) ; the 11th solution corresponds to trees having @xmath602 edges .",
    "similar constructions certainly must also exist for weighted trees .",
    "let us revisit the initial problem about the minimum degree of the polynomial @xmath603 , see page  .",
    "when there are no dz - triples defined over  @xmath5 , we may relax the condition of the @xmath61 being the least possible and thus obtain solutions with bigger @xmath61 but , in return , defined over @xmath5 .",
    "two example of this kind are shown in figures [ fig : deg - relaxed ] and  [ fig : deg9-instead-8 ] . in the first one ,",
    "@xmath604 but @xmath605 instead of  7 since one of the faces is of degree  3 instead of  1 . in the second example , @xmath606 but @xmath605 instead of  8 since , instead of two black vertices of degree  3 we have here one black vertex of degree  6 .",
    "now let us look at the second example .",
    "though a computation of the belyi function in this case is not difficult , it is still interesting to analyze this example in purely combinatorial terms .",
    "the map shown on the right in figure  [ fig : deg9-instead-8 ] is a unimap @xmath171 of figure  [ fig : trees2maps ] , which is also equal to the unitree @xmath386 in figure  [ fig : sporadic-8 ] .",
