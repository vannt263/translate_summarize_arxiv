    "since the pioneering experiments of smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite-@xcite , the single - molecule micromechanical studies have become one of the central themes in molecular biophysics .",
    "these techniques have contributed substantially into our understanding of the properties of various biomolecules and their interactions .",
    "the original stretching experiments with the double - stranded dna ( ds - dna ) were followed by the theoretical work of marko and siggia  @xcite who demonstrated that the observed elastic response ( _ i.e. _  the dependence of the ds - dna end - to - end extension on the applied stretching force ) is in remarkable agreement with the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model of polymer elasticity . within this model ,",
    "the chain is described as a constant - length rod with finite bending rigidity subjected to the thermal fluctuations .",
    "various modifications and refinements of the wlc model have been proposed over the past decade to include additional effects , such as torsional constrains  @xcite , bond elasticity , and sequence disorder  @xcite .",
    "recently , a discrete version of the wlc has been suggested as a plausible model for the single - stranded dna ( ss - dna )  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the modifications of the wlc model are within the domain of linear elasticity , and the overall non - linearity of the observed response is associated with the entropic nature of the problem .    in this paper , we discuss an intrinsically non - linear generalization of the wlc that takes into account effects of the localized structural defects on its elastic response .",
    "in particular , we study a generic model of the wlc with reversible kink - like singularities .",
    "this model is relevant to several systems of interest .",
    "first , the kink - like defects can be used to model the sharp bending of the ds - dna backbone associated with binding of certain proteins  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , the protein - mediated looping of the dna would normally result in a non - trivial mutual alignment of the ends of the loop , which can also be interpreted as a kink defect .",
    "typically , such dna - protein interactions are sequence - dependent , and there is a strong preference for the proteins to bind to the particular sites on the dna . however , in a realistic situation the non - specific binding takes place as well , and it may affect the overall properties of the dna in vivo .",
    "since the stretching experiments can probe the elastic properties on the single - molecule scale , they may be used to extract the information about the parameters of such dna - protein interactions .",
    "the theoretical study of this paper is important for the interpretation of the results of this type of future experiments .",
    "this problem was recently addressed in a general context of the dna - deforming proteins  @xcite . in that work , a discrete version of the wlc model",
    "was used to obtain the stretching curves with the numerical transfer matrix technique . in our paper ,",
    "use of the continuous model allows us to obtain a variational analytical result and compare it against the numerics .",
    "in addition , our approach yields important insights into the underlying physics associated with the predicted elastic behavior .",
    "the only significant limitation of the continuous model is that it does not allow one to approach the ( hypothetical ) saturation regime where the dna gets completely covered by the proteins .    the other system where our model is relevant is the ss - dna .",
    "while several models have already been proposed to describe its elastic properties , neither of them is sufficiently justified by the microscopic structure of the molecule , and all of these models break down at high enough stretching forces .",
    "analysis of the backbone structure of the ss - dna suggests that the traditional models such as the wlc or the freely - joint chain ( fjc ) are unlikely to be adequate as the coarse - grained description of the chain .",
    "indeed , on the atomic level the conformations of the ss - dna are mainly associated with rotations of certain bonds .",
    "it is well known in the context of the general polymer physics that such rotations typically involve transitions between the discreet _",
    "trans _ and _ gauche _ states , which are normally described with the rotational isomer model  @xcite . on the other hand , there are also elastic modes associated with small deviations of the torsional angles from their local equilibrium values ( _ i.e. _  from these _ trans _ and _ gauche _ states ) .",
    "the wlc would be a natural model for describing the long - wavelength elastic modes due to these small deformations . in order to account for both types of conformations",
    ", one needs to construct a hybrid description that would unify the two classical models of polymer physics .",
    "in fact , our problem of the wlc with reversible kinks has all the essential features of such a hybrid model .",
    "indeed , the local _ trans _ conformation can be viewed as a `` no - kink '' state , while the _ gauche _ state can be considered as a kink since it corresponds to a turn in the overall direction of the backbone .",
    "our model is different from a recent model by wiggins , phillips and p.  nelson  @xcite , where the kinks are taken as freely - bending hinges instead of the fixed - angle singularities considered here . in most cases of the biological relevance the fixed - angle kinks appear as a more adequate description of the respective singularities than the free hinges .",
    "in particular , the _ gauche _ states are characterized by the specific angles between the bonds fixed by the chemistry of the polymer ( ss - dna ) .",
    "similarly , protein binding and protein - mediated looping feature some characteristic angles determined by the nature of the proteins , although these angles may vary over some range of values  @xcite ( we consider modification of our fixed - angle results for the case of these deformable kinks with thermal fluctuations at the very end of this work ) .",
    "our results will be seen to depend on the kink angle quite substantially , and thus this extra parameter is important . a model with soft annealed kinks similar to @xcite",
    "was also considered recently by yan and marko  @xcite in the context of dna cyclization .    in the following section we first describe our model for a worm - like chain with reversible kinks , and",
    "then outline a general approach to its solution by drawing an analogy to the quantum rotator .",
    "subsequently , we solve the resulting evolution equation both analytically ( by the variational method ) and numerically ( by direct integration ) , and compare the results .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in both the weak - force and the strong - force limits as well as in the intermediate regime , and draw physical conclusions from our findings .",
    "[ [ model . ] ] model .",
    "we consider a worm - like polymer chain with rod - like bending elasticity .",
    "the persistence length of the unperturbed chain is denoted by @xmath0 , and the total length of the chain @xmath1 is much greater than the persistence length throughout this paper .",
    "we presume that kink - like structural defects can exist anywhere along the chain .",
    "these defects are reversible and can appear and disappear spontaneously , with certain free - energy penalty associated with each of them . we should emphasize that we neglect the sequence dependence of kink probability , thus limiting ourselves to the case of non - specific dna - protein binding only .",
    "each kink is characterized by the ( fixed ) opening angle @xmath2 ( fig .  [ geometry ] )",
    "; this value is the same for all the kinks and is an external parameter of the problem .",
    "the presence of each kink costs finite amount of the free energy @xmath3 ( at zero stretching force ) , which is also assumed to be the same for each kink .",
    "the structural defects are local , _",
    "i.e. _  they are characterized by a microscopic length scale @xmath4 much smaller than the persistence length @xmath0 and can be considered as point - like for most practical purposes .",
    "we also neglect any direct interaction of the kinks separated by more than @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the three length scales of the problem are related by @xmath5 .",
    "an important quantity is the average line density of the kinks @xmath6 in the absence of the applied stretching force .",
    "this quantity is defined as the boltzmann probability of the existence of a kink per characteristic length scale of a kink site @xmath4 : @xmath7 at each site of length @xmath4 , there might be either a kink [ factor @xmath8 or no kink [ factor 1 ] , with the probability of having a kink at an arbitrary site ( per unit length ) given by the expression above . note that in practice we assume that @xmath9 , and therefore @xmath10 _ i.e. _  kinks are rare and far apart , and only few possible sites are occupied by the kinks .",
    "the chain is stretched by applying force @xmath11 in the @xmath12 direction of the euclidian coordinates .",
    "the effective energy of a chain segment between two adjacent kinks is given by the sum of the bending energy and the coupling to the stretching force : @xmath13\\,ds .",
    "\\label{energy}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the coordinate along the chain , @xmath15 is the unit tangent vector of the chain at @xmath14 , and kink number @xmath16 is located at coordinate @xmath17 [ so that @xmath18 .",
    "this expression was used by marko and siggia  @xcite and in some earlier works on worm - like chain elasticity .",
    "this time , however , it does not apply to the entire chain ; instead , it applies only to the chain segments between kinks . at each kink",
    "( _ i.e. _  at @xmath17 ) the tangent vector experiences an abrupt change of its orientation and hops to a direction @xmath19 away from the preceding one .",
    "mathematically , this can be written as a constraint @xmath20    [ [ analogy - to - the - quantum - rotator - and - the - free - energy . ] ] analogy to the quantum rotator , and the free energy .",
    "let @xmath21 be the orientational distribution function for the chain ends .",
    "then the probability distribution for the tangent vector @xmath22 at coordinate @xmath14 for inner points of the chain is simply @xmath23 .",
    "function @xmath24 satisfies a schrodinger - like equation for evolution along the chain .",
    "this can be demonstrated by the path - integral technique  @xcite where path integration is conducted over all possible chain conformations , thus accounting , among other things , for the entropy of the chain . a more illustrative ( though less rigorous ) way to obtain the same equation also exists  @xcite . here",
    ", we will only notice that each term in the effective energy  ( [ energy ] ) has a counterpart in this schrodinger - like equation , in the same way as each term of the mechanical energy in classical mechanics has a counterpart in the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian .",
    "thus , an unperturbed chain ( without any kinks ) obeys the evolution equation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 the term with the laplacian in @xmath22 arises from the term with the @xmath14-derivative in the effective energy  ( [ energy ] ) , while coupling to the external force remains the same [ up to the sign change ] ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 is the hamiltonian of the quantum rotator in quantum mechanics .",
    "now we need to add a term to this hamiltonian responsible for the non - local constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "this teleportation - like term changes the direction of @xmath22 abruptly , with the tangential vector @xmath15 hopping instantly by a finite angle @xmath19 at the location of a kink .",
    "such behavior is described by a delta - functional kernel in the hamiltonian : @xmath28 where the full hamiltonian is now @xmath29 and the @xmath30 factor provides the proper normalization of the kernel . the number of such non - local hops of the tangential vector ( _ i.e. _  the number of kinks ) yields the proportionality constant in the expression above .",
    "thus , the missing pre - factor is simply the average line density of the kinks @xmath6 , and the full hamiltonian is @xmath31    the structure of the evolution equation @xmath32 suggests the standard procedure for solving this kind of quantum - mechanical - like problems : expansion in eigenfunctions of the time - independent ( _ i.e. _  @xmath14-independent ) schrodinger equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues , respectively . since each of the terms in such an expansion depends on the exponent of ( the negative of ) the corresponding eigenvalue , it is easy to conclude that for sufficiently long chains most terms in the expansion die off very fast , and only the smallest - eigenvalue term governs the long - chain behavior .",
    "thus , we are interested in the lowest eigenvalue @xmath35 of the equation  ( [ eigenproblem ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the chain is then simply related to this lowest eigenvalue by @xmath36 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "[ [ variational - solution . ] ] variational solution .",
    "since the lowest eigenvalue is being sought , we use the variational method for finding the analytical solution to eigenproblem  ( [ eigenproblem ] ) .",
    "application of the force makes the @xmath12 direction highly preferable for the tangential vector , and therefore the distribution function @xmath34 must be strongly - peaked at @xmath37 .",
    "conventionally , we choose @xmath38 as a trial function , or @xmath39 upon proper normalization ( @xmath40 ) . here",
    "@xmath41 is the variational parameter .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue can then be estimated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 evaluating the last expression with trial function  ( [ trialfunction ] ) yields @xmath44 , \\label{freeenergy}\\ ] ] where we introduced @xmath45 .",
    "minimization with respect to @xmath41 gives the implicit dependence of @xmath41 on the applied force or , being inverted , the explicit dependence of the force on @xmath41 : @xmath46 note that here and everywhere below @xmath41 is the particular value of the variational parameter that minimizes the free energy ( instead of the generic variable implied until this point ) .",
    "knowledge of the free energy as a function of force  ( [ freeenergy ] ) also allows one to determine the extension of the chain : @xmath47 thus , equations  ( [ force ] ) and ( [ extension ] ) provide the parametric dependence of the force on the extension , with @xmath41 playing the role of the parameter .",
    "this extension curve is shown in fig .",

    "i.e. _  when @xmath50 .",
    "the new physics introduced by the kinks is represented by the term proportional to @xmath6 in equation  ( [ force ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the first and the second terms in this equation is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath51 , which has the physical meaning of the average number of kinks per the persistence length in the absence of force .",

    "clearly , the elastic response of the chain with kinks is characterized by the renormalized persistent length @xmath57 this quantity reduces to the bare persistence length @xmath0 in the absence of kinks ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is also apparent that @xmath58 , and therefore a worm - like chain with kinks is _ harder _ than a worm - like chain without them .",

    "it may appear that analogous renormalization was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite as well , however , these works consider quenched sequence disorder , and thus the physical origin of their renormalization is very different .    for high bending rigidity ( @xmath59 ) ,",

    "this result deserves some discussion as it turns out to be closely related to the flory result for _ trans - gauche _ rotational isomers  @xcite . if a _ gauche _",

    "hence , the response of a worm - like chain with kinks to the strong stretching is dominated mostly by the bare worm - like - chain elasticity .",
    "in addition , kinks contribute an exponential correction to that main - order result , which can be interpreted as due to the `` ideal gas of kinks '' .",
    "indeed , the second term in equation  ( [ freeenergy ] ) is the average line density of the kinks in the presence of the stretching force , and it is equivalent to the concentration of the molecules in the ideal gas .",
    "thus , the second term in equation  ( [ strongforces ] ) derived from the free energy  ( [ freeenergy ] ) is analogous to the relation @xmath71 for the pressure of the ideal gas .",
    "[ [ high - rigidity - small - kink - angle - numerical - results . ] ] high rigidity , small kink angle , numerical results .    probably the most interesting feature of fig .",
    "[ extensioncurve ] is related to the middle portion of the high - rigidity extension curves , where an instability region with @xmath72 is present .",
    "this instability region exists when parameter @xmath51 is greater than the `` critical '' value @xmath73 , _",
    "i.e. _  when the chains are of high rigidity",
    ". the `` critical '' value is determined by the conditions @xmath74 and is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the solution to @xmath77 and is large for all kink angles ( the lowest @xmath76 is around 5 for small kink angles ) .",
    "the last equation allows for simple analytical solutions in the limits of small kink angles ( @xmath78 ) and large kink angles ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , the analytical asymptotics of @xmath73 in these two limits are readily available : @xmath80 and @xmath81 these asymptotics as well as the exact numerical solution for @xmath73 are shown in fig .",
    "[ critical ] . as can be observed in this figure ,",
    "the `` critical '' value is much lower for sharp kinks , and hence for smaller kink angles the instability region is present for much lower values of @xmath51 and lies in the range of the measurable stretching forces in fig .",

    "this instability behavior is similar to the behavior of the van - der - vaals curves for the ordinary liquid - gas system and hence suggests the co - existence of two `` phases '' .",
    "of course , no true phases can exist in a one - dimensional system like the dna molecule under consideration , however , for the worm - like chain with kinks it may be appropriate to think of `` kink - free '' and `` kink - rich '' portions of the chain instead of the true phases .    in order to check this `` two - phase '' hypothesis , we conduct a direct numerical solution of the evolution equation  ( [ evolution ] ) with the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in order to avoid the delta - functional singularity inside the integration in the last term ,",

    "( [ evolution ] ) on each step and setting the @xmath14-derivative ( the left - hand side ) equal to the result .",
    "this procedure is stopped when the relative change of the relative extension @xmath87 evaluated at each step becomes very small and hence @xmath21 itself becomes the stationary distribution function .",
    "such an approach yields more precise results for all the quantities since it does not make any _ a priory _ assumptions about the shape of the distribution function .",

    "however , for rigid chains and small kink angles , we observe existence of a secondary peak in addition to the main peak .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the variational and the numerical results can be explained by inadequacy of the trial function in the variational method , which ignores the possibility of the secondary maximum .",
    "the location of the secondary peak corresponds approximately to the angle @xmath19 away from the direction of the applied force ( @xmath12 ) , _ i.e. _  there is an unusually high portion of chain segments at angle @xmath19 to the force .",

    "therefore , the proposed theory should be applicable to the ss - dna whose conformations may involve both the discrete _ trans - gauche _ rotations of the chemical bonds and small deformations giving rise to the continuous elasticity . another important class of systems where our model is applicable is the ds - dna with sharp protein - induced bends .    in the limit of weak stretching forces , the elastic response of the kinked dna chain is characterized by a renormalized persistence length , which is smaller than the bare persistence length .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the observation made in the earlier numerical work on the problem  @xcite .",
    "we obtained the analytical expression for the renormalized persistence length and showed that the classical results for both the pure wlc and the rotational isomer models can be recovered exactly as limits of our expression .",
    "furthermore , by using the variational approach , we calculated the complete non - linear response of the chain to the stretching .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the direct numerical solution over a substantial range of the model parameters .    in the limit of strong stretching forces",
    ", we recover the pure worm - like - chain behavior with exponential corrections due to the `` ideal gas '' of kinks .",
    "the variational theory breaks down in the regimes of high chain rigidity and small kink angles . in this case , the analytical curves have signatures of instability similar to those of the van  der  waals gas . by analyzing our numerical results ,",
    "we conclude that this behavior corresponds to the creation of multi - kink objects , _",
    "e.g. _  kink pairs .    for soft kinks , where the opening angle can fluctuate and thus relax the overall energy of the chain , we found that the number of kinks increases compared to the hard - kink case , and the dna gets harder to extend .",
    "the major limitation of our model is that we have neglected the sequence - specific effects by assuming that the kink energy is constant along the chain .",
    "while this may be a reasonable first approximation to both problems of the ss - dna elasticity and the non - specific protein - dna binding , a significant future work is needed in order to include the effects of the sequence disorder .",
    "several experimental tests of our results can be suggested . in the case of the ss - dna , in order to probe the `` pure '' elastic response of the chain one needs to exclude the effects of base - pairing and the electrostatic interactions . in the existing experiments , these effects",
    "are not suppressed , and thus direct comparison is not possible at the moment .",
    "( note that the electrostatic and the base - pairing contributions were _ simulated _ in ref .",
    "@xcite instead of being excluded experimentally . )",
    "however , in the future an experiment can be done at the conditions of very strong screening ( _ i.e. _  at high salt concentration ) with all - purine or all - pyrimidine ss - dna sequences to avoid these contributions ."
