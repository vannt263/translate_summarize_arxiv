    "the recent discovery of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in uge@xmath1 @xcite urhge @xcite and zrzn@xmath1 @xcite has led to renewed interest in the relationship between ferromagnetism and superconductivity . by contrast , the relationship between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity has been more thoroughly studied @xcite , since it is relevant to many compounds , such as the cuprates @xcite , borocarbides @xcite , heavy fermion superconductors @xcite and the layered organic superconductors @xcite .",
    "particular interest has been focused on superconductivity on the border of a magnetic phase and in particular in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "this is observed experimentally in cuprates , several heavy fermion systems , layered organics and uge@xmath1 .",
    "it is also thought that urhge@xmath1 may be essentially similar to uge@xmath1 but under the influence of chemical pressure @xcite .",
    "similarly , the ferromagnetism in zrzn@xmath1 also shows a qcp at high pressures .",
    "but in this case , unlike uge@xmath1 , the highest superconducting transition temperatures are observed at ambient pressure , that is at the furthest point from the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic qcp .",
    "theoretically it is thought that at or near to the qcp quantum spin fluctuations , can lead to spin - fluctuation induced pairing . for the case of ferromagnetic qcp",
    "this was first studied by fay and appel ( who also suggested that zrzn@xmath1 might be a suitable system in which to observe this effect ) . in this case",
    "the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations lead to spin - triplet pairing , by analogue with the case of superfluid @xmath2he .",
    "by contrast , in the case of quantum critical antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations spin - singlet d - wave pairing states are favoured @xcite .",
    "currently , very little is known about the superconducting pairing state in the ferromagnetic superconductors uge@xmath1 , urhge and zrzn@xmath1 . if the pairing mechanism is indeed caused by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , then we might expect spin - triplet pairing states . however , presently there is insufficient evidence in support of this hypothesis to be decisive .",
    "thus it is still legitimate to consider other scenarios .",
    "in fact this is what we shall do here . in short ,",
    "we point out that the decline of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , with pressure could be a simple consequence of p - wave pairing of arbitrary origin in an exchange field .    in particular we will consider a simple model of the coexistence between ferromagnetism and superconductivity based on a parameterised electron - electron attractive interaction of unspecified origin .",
    "we will derive bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) and gap equations for this model using the hartree  fock  gorkov approximation .",
    "we will consider separately the cases of : spin singlet ( s - wave ) pairing , opposite spin pairing ( osp ) and equal spin pairing ( esp ) spin triplet ( p - wave ) states .",
    "solving the gap equations for these pairing states , we will then illustrate some important properties of superconductivity in the presence of ferromagnetism .",
    "we consider superconductivity arising in a hubbard model with an effective attractive pairwise interaction @xmath4 , acting between electrons at crystal sites @xmath5 , @xmath6 with spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in principle",
    "this effective interaction could arise from either conventional pairing mechanisms , such as electron - phonon coupling , or exchange of spin - fluctuations . here",
    "we shall assume that the effective interaction is both short - ranged in space , namely @xmath9 only for @xmath10 or nearest neighbours , and non - retarded .    in the ferromagnetic state we must also include the effective exchange field caused by the ferromagnetism .",
    "this enters in the model hamiltonian as to the zeeman splitting @xmath11 .",
    "thus the complete hamiltonian for this model is    @xmath12    where the @xmath13 are the usual annihilation ( creation ) operators , @xmath14 is the number operator and the @xmath15 are the components of the vector of pauli matrices    @xmath16    in this context we should note that the ferromagnetism of zrzn@xmath1 is accurately described by the lsda as a weak itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "experimentally the exchange splitting is clearly resolved in de haas - van alphen experiments @xcite and band structure calculations ( also presented in reference @xcite ) are in excellent agreement with these experiments . moreover ,",
    "the calculated moment ( 0.18@xmath17 ) is close to the observed moment ( 0.17@xmath17 ) .",
    "both the curie temperature , @xmath18 , and low temperature magnetisation are linear functions of pressure @xcite .",
    "hence the low temperature magnetisation is a linear function of @xmath18 , in line with the predictions of the stoner model .",
    "the most unusual magnetic property of zrzn@xmath1 is that , although a field of 0.05  t is enough to form a single magnetic domain , the ordered moment is unsaturated up to 35  t @xcite .",
    "this is far more naturally understood in an itinerant model such as lsda or the stoner model than , say , the heisenberg model . on the other hand ,",
    "we hasten to add that it is not clear whether this picture is useful for the ferromagnetic superconductor uge@xmath1 , since there the moments are much more strongly localised .    making the usual hartree - fock ",
    "gorkov approximation , such that @xmath19 , and using the spin - generalised bogoliubov ",
    "valatin transformation ,    @xmath20    subject to the completeness relation    @xmath21    we find that the bogoliubov de gennes ( bdg ) equations for this hamiltonian are    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the normal ( that is non superconducting and non ferromagnetic ) state energy and @xmath24 .    the superconducting order parameter , @xmath25 , is calculated self - consistently from    @xmath26    we now introduce the balain - werthamer ( bw ) transformation ,    @xmath27    which separates the superconducting order parameter into a singlet ( scalar ) part , @xmath28 and a triplet ( vector ) part , @xmath29 . in terms of these parameters",
    "the bdg equations can be rewritten as    @xmath30    using this formalism , it is also possible to calculate the free energy in the general case .",
    "this is given by    @xmath31   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\times \\big [ u_{\\alpha\\sigma'}(-{\\bi}{k } ' ) v_{\\beta\\sigma'}^*({\\bi}{k } ' ) f_{{\\bi}{k}'\\sigma ' } + v_{\\alpha\\sigma'}^*(-{\\bi}{k } ' ) u_{\\beta\\sigma'}({\\bi}{k } ' ) \\big ( 1 - f_{{\\bi}{k}'\\sigma ' } \\big ) \\big ] \\bigg ) \\nonumber \\\\   + \\sum_{{\\bi}{k}\\alpha\\beta\\sigma } \\big ( { \\bi}{\\sigma}_{\\alpha\\beta } \\cdot { \\bi}{h } \\big ) \\big ( u_{\\alpha\\sigma}^*({\\bi}{k } ) u_{\\beta\\sigma}({\\bi}{k } ) f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma } + v_{\\alpha\\sigma}({\\bi}{k } ) v_{\\alpha\\sigma}^*({\\bi}{k } ) \\big(1-f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma}\\big ) \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\   - k_bt \\sum_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma } \\big [ f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma } \\ln{f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma } } + \\big(1 - f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma}\\big ) \\ln{\\big ( 1-f_{{\\bi}{k}\\sigma } \\big ) } \\big ] \\label{eqn : free energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this stage one must resort either to solving these equations numerically @xcite , or to studying special cases . in this paper",
    "we shall take the later approach .",
    "first , we begin by considering the case singlet pairing only ( i.e. @xmath32 ) . in section [ section : triplet ]",
    "we will consider the case of only triplet pairing ( i.e. when @xmath33 ) .",
    "in the case of a s - wave spin singlet superconductor , it was shown by fulde , ferrel , larkin and ovchinnikov ( fflo ) that the superconducting ground state becomes non - uniform for small external exchange fields .",
    "this solution is well known , and we shall not study it here . on the other hand there are also solutions which are spatially uniform . whichever of these solutions is the ground state",
    "can only be determined by calculating the free energy for both and finding which is the lower solution . in strong fields",
    "the fflo state will be the minimum , but in weaker fields the fflo state will be unstable to the uniform solution . in the rest of this section we study the gap equations for the spatially uniform case .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath28 transforms as a scalar under spin rotation .",
    "thus , if there is no superconductivity in the triplet channel , we can , without loss of generality , rewrite the bdg equations as    @xmath34    by rotating our spin reference frame so that @xmath35 .",
    "can be separated into two sets of bdg equations , so we have    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    it is now a simple matter to regain the standard result for the spectrum of a singlet superconductor in a spin only magnetic field :    @xmath38    with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the four corresponding energy levels are sketched in fig ,  [ fig : singlet spectrum ] .",
    "clearly reduces to the standard bcs expression for the spectrum of a singlet superconductor in the absence of exchange splitting as @xmath41 . also , when @xmath42 equations ( [ eqn : singlet bdg a ] ) and ( [ eqn : singlet bdg b ] ) reduce to the usual bdg equations @xcite and we see that we are justified in associating @xmath28 with the usual singlet superconducting order parameter @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear from that    @xmath44    and it can also be shown that    @xmath45    and @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 is , of course , of the same mathematical form as the spectrum of a singlet superconductor in the absence of exchange splitting .",
    "however , it is _ not _ correct to say that @xmath48 _ is _ the spectrum of a singlet superconductor in the absence of exchange splitting as the value of @xmath28 ( although , importantly , not the value of @xmath49 ) depends on @xmath50 in general .    substituting our expressions for the eigenvectors of the bdg into the self - consistency condition ( [ eqn : self_const ] ) we find that the gap equation is    @xmath51    in the absence of exchange splitting the gap equation regains its familiar bcs form .",
    "however , we note that surprisingly the exchange splitting dependence of the gap only enters via the fermi ( @xmath52 ) term .",
    "this means that when @xmath53 the gap equation becomes    @xmath54    which is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "we must now ask what this result means physically .",
    "the most obvious conclusion is that , at zero temperature , the gap in independent of exchange splitting .",
    "this is true , but with one condition , which we will discuss below .",
    "the gap equation is a non - linear integral equation . and , as such , has , in general , more than one solution .",
    "( for example the trivial solution @xmath55 is always a solution . )",
    "all that we have actually shown is that for any given solution @xmath28 is independent @xmath11 at @xmath53 . to find the ground state we must consider all possible solutions and calculate the free energy of each solution . in the absence of exchange splitting the gap equation can be derived by minimising the free energy with respect to the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the trivial solution is only the ground state when no other solution exists .",
    "however , no such proof exists for a superconductor in a finite exchange splitting .",
    "this means that it is perfectly possible there to be a phase transition from the superconducting to normal states as the exchange splitting is increased at zero temperature .",
    "any such phase transition will be perfectly first order in the sense that the order parameter will jump from zero ( above the critical exchange splitting , @xmath56 ) to some finite value ( below @xmath56 ) and remain at that value for all @xmath57 .",
    "the order parameter as a function of exchange splitting will therefore resemble a heaviside step function .",
    "of course , as in general other superconducting phases can exist ( such as the fflo state ) phase transitions can also occur between different superconducting phases in a similar manner @xcite .",
    "such a phase transition was first studied independently by clogston @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite who both , in fact , assumed the independence of @xmath28 on @xmath50 that we have derived above . using this assumption they were able to show from simple thermodynamics that if the exchange splitting is greater than @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the superconducting gap at zero temperature ( and zero exchange splitting ) then the normal state has a lower energy than the s - wave superconducting state .",
    "this is known both of as clogston  chandrasekhar limiting and as pauli - paramagnetic limiting .",
    "chandrasekhar limiting clearly applies to all singlet states , but does not necessarily apply to triplet states . in most superconducting materials @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , if a superconductor has a large upper critical field in comparison to the clogston ",
    "chandrasekhar limit this is good evidence for triplet superconductivity . the fflo state can also display @xmath61 . clogston ",
    "chandrasekhar limiting has been observed in the layered organic compound @xmath62(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 @xcite when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the layers ( which prevents the formation of orbital currents due to the highly two dimensional nature of the material ) .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have solved the gap equation numerically for a cubic lattice .",
    "we assumed @xmath63 ( i.e. an on - site interaction ) corresponding to the case of local s - wave pairing .",
    "the comparison between the calculated superconducting and normal state free energies , leads to the phase diagram given in .",
    "this calculated phase diagram is in excellent agreement with that calculated from the baltensperger ",
    "sarma equation @xcite .",
    "however , while the baltensperger ",
    "sarma equation only allows for the calculation of the superconducting - metal phase transition , our numerical gap equation solution allows for the evaluation of the order parameter at any point in @xmath64 space and hence for the evaluation of thermodynamic variables such as the heat capacity ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the volume of the first brillouin zone .    a numerical study of these equations @xcite shows that , in an exchange field , the thermodynamic functions see an effective gap , @xmath67 , i.e.    @xmath68    where    @xmath69",
    "we will now consider the properties of a triplet superconductor in a magnetic field . using a similar approach to the singlet case above we are able to derive many of the same physical quantities .",
    "this highlights both similarities and differences between the singlet and triplet cases , which may perhaps help in identifying the pairing state symmetry in specific ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "before we begin we will generalise a useful theorem due to de gennes @xcite .",
    "we begin by writing the bdg equations ( [ eqn : spin gen bdg ] ) in a pseudo - spinor notation :    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    and @xmath72 multiplying by @xmath73 , taking the complex conjugate , parity inverting and exchanging the rows of leads to    @xmath74    as both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are even under parity inversion .",
    "we have therefore shown that if @xmath77 is an eigenvector of the spin - generalised bdg equations in a magnetic field , with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath75 then , @xmath78 is also an eigenvector and that the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath7 can take two values ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) we have identified all of the eigenstates .",
    "this analysis holds for both triplet and singlet states .",
    "( for a singlet state with @xmath82 it clearly reduces to the theorem of de gennes . ) the spectrum for a singlet superconductor in an exchange field ( shown in ) is clearly in agreement with this theorem .    when studying triplet states , and particularly when studying the effect of exchange splitting on the triplet state , it is useful to introduce the notion of unitary and non - unitary states . for a triplet state",
    "@xmath83    and , in the absence of exchange splitting ,    @xmath84    it is therefore useful to introduce the vector @xmath85 which is defined by    @xmath86    it is clear that @xmath85 is a _",
    "real _ vector .",
    "a unitary state is defined as any state in which @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .    by setting the singlet order parameter , @xmath28 , to zero",
    "we can write down the bdg equations for a triplet superconductor in an exchange field ,    @xmath89    the eigenvalues of these bdg equations are given by @xcite    @xmath90    where    @xmath91    in zero field we clearly have the usual result for the spectrum a triplet superconductor .",
    "again , we can also derive the expressions for thermodynamic quantities in a general triplet state .",
    "for example the heat capacity is given by    @xmath92    and the ( vector ) magnetisation , @xmath93 , is given by    @xmath94    following the methods of sigrist and ueda it can be shown @xcite that in the absence of exchange splitting the gap equations for a triplet superconductor are    @xmath95 .",
    "\\label{eqn : gap eqn non unitary no exchange   splitting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , these methods do not generalise to a finite exchange splitting .",
    "fortunately triplet states can be separated into three classes : those that contain only osp states , those that contain only esp states and those that contain both osp and esp states .",
    "the first two cases represent a great simplification and we will now study these special cases .",
    "however , it should be noted that neither of the formalisms presented below can deal with states that contain both osp and esp such as the b and b@xmath1 phases .",
    "an osp state is defined as any state for which @xmath96 for all @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in this limited sense , we may describe @xmath97 as parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "much as in the case of singlet pairing we can , without loss of generality , rotate the system , recalling the @xmath97 transforms as a vector under rotation , so that    @xmath98    again we can separate into two bdg equations and hence , in a similar manner to which we derived the singlet gap equation , we find that the gap equations for osp triplet superconductivity are    @xmath99    note that this equation is of precisely the same mathematical form as the singlet gap equation . both the phase diagram and the effective gap seen by thermodynamic probes are the same as we earlier found for singlet superconductivity .",
    "however , this time the effective gap seen by thermodynamic probes is given by @xcite    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the mean gap at the fermi surface .",
    "all singlet pairing states are , by definition , osp states .",
    "thus it appears that , in the presence of exchange splitting , the important property of a state is whether it is an osp or an esp state , not whether it is a triplet or a singlet state .",
    "an esp state is defined as any state for which @xmath102 for all @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in this limited sense , we may describe @xmath97 as perpendicular to @xmath11 . in this case , for @xmath103 , the spin triplet bdg equations are    @xmath104    we can now easily separate the bdg equations into a pair of bdg equations for up electrons ,    @xmath105    and a set of bdg equations for down electrons ,    @xmath106    using the self - consistency condition we easily find that the gap equations are    @xmath107    with    @xmath108    as @xmath109 from below , @xmath110 and hence @xmath111 .",
    "therefore the gap equation becomes    @xmath112    thus , near @xmath113 the gap equation is linear .",
    "this allows @xmath113 to be determined very accurately .",
    "further by comparing the transition temperatures of various symmetries one can find which has the highest transition temperature and hence which state occurs for @xmath114 .    clearly , one can not , in general , use the linearised gap equation to study transitions from one superconducting state to another as the gap equation can no longer be linearised below the first superconducting transition .",
    "the exception to this rule is the transition from an esp state with only one type of pairing to an esp state with both @xmath115 and @xmath116 pairing ( an example of such a transition is the transition from the a@xmath117 phase to the a@xmath1 phase ) , because of the complete separation of the spin - up and spin - down subsystems in the presence of exchange splitting and the absence of opposite spin pairing or spin flip processes .",
    "we solved the linearised gap equations ( [ eqn : linearised gap eqn ] ) numerically for parameters chosen of zrzn@xmath1 ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . to do this",
    "we used a simple cubic tight binding model and a k - space integration mesh of @xmath118 points .",
    "we use such a large array for two reasons .",
    "a fine integration mesh is required to accurately determine the density of states ( dos ) . our method ( implicitly ) requires an accurate calculation of the spin dependant dos , @xmath119 .",
    "this is particularly important in our case as we are varying the exchange splitting and thus we are changing the @xmath119 , so any errors in evaluating @xmath120 will lead to significant errors in our calculation of the variation of @xmath113 with @xmath50 .",
    "we show the results of our numerical calculations in figure [ fig : numerical_res_zz_fit ] .",
    "the line is a cubic curve fitted to the numerical data . for any given exchange splitting , @xmath50 , there are two transition temperatures , corresponding to the two separate spin components of the esp order parameter .",
    "we have plotted the transition temperature for @xmath115 pairing on the positive @xmath50 side of the graph and the transition temperature for @xmath116 paring on the negative @xmath50 scale .",
    "there are several reasons for plotting the data in this way .",
    "\\(i ) in this way the graph shows the behaviour of the @xmath115 pairing state over a full range of exchange splitting , from positive to negative .",
    "\\(ii ) we see that the point @xmath42 is not a special case , and the curve is smooth there .",
    "\\(iii ) we also have a larger data range to fit over , and thus increase the accuracy of the cubic fit .",
    "zero exchange splitting is not a special point because in both the non - linear and linearised gap equations exchange splitting is mathematically equivalent to a change in chemical potential .",
    "thus , the graph plotted in the manner shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical_res_zz_fit ] can also be interpreted as a plot of critical temperature of the of the triplet a phase as a function of the chemical potential in zero exchange splitting .",
    "we now plot the critical temperature for both @xmath115 and @xmath116 pairing on the same graph ( figure [ fig : numerical_res_zz ] ) .",
    "this plot shows is then the ( @xmath50 , @xmath121 ) superconducting phase diagram for our model .",
    "( this , of course , assumes that no further phase transitions occur at low temperatures . )",
    "the higher transition temperature is the transition to the a@xmath117 phase ( where only @xmath122 pairing occurs ) and the second transition is a transition to the a@xmath1 phase ( where @xmath123 pairing begins ) . in the paramagnetic state ( the line @xmath42 ) the superconducting state is an a phase as the superconducting order parameter is the same for both the @xmath115 and @xmath116 pairing states .",
    "( the a@xmath1 phase becomes the a phase via a cross over , rather than a phase transition . )",
    "the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig : numerical_res_zz ] is clearly equivalent to the a@xmath117-a@xmath1 splitting of @xmath2he in a magnetic field .",
    "experimental measurement of this phase transition in @xmath2he due to remeijer are reported reference @xcite . at first sight figure [ fig : numerical_res_zz ] and reference",
    "@xcite appear rather different , however the are in fact almost identical , as we will now show .",
    "the dimensionless measure of the exchange splitting for the remijer experiments is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the fermi temperature and @xmath126 is the nuclear magnetron for @xmath2he , while for our calculation the dimensionless exchange splitting is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the bandwidth .",
    "the experiments of remeijer were not performed at constant pressure , which complicates the analysis somewhat , however they conclude that    @xmath129    where @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the range @xmath132 at an effective pressure of 3.4  mpa i.e the splitting is , to a very good approximation linear . the equivalent exchange splitting in our calculations",
    "is @xmath133  ev .",
    "it can clearly be seen from figure [ fig : numerical_res_zz ] that our calculations give an approximately linear splitting between the a@xmath117 and a@xmath1 phase transitions over the range of exchange splitting @xmath134  ev . hence our results are consistent with the what is known about @xmath2he .",
    "( although , of course , we had no right to expect this agreement as our parameters where chosen for zrzn@xmath1 and not @xmath2he . )",
    "further this illustrates the fact that ferromagnetic superconductors will provide an excellent laboratory in which to study the splitting of the a@xmath117 and a@xmath1 phase transitions ( and the non - linear splitting in particular ) over a far greater range of exchange splitting than is possible in @xmath2he .",
    "further , when the effects of scattering from non - magnetic impurities are included this model gives results that are qualitatively consistent with the observed pressure dependence of @xmath113 in zrzn@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have derived gap equations for superconductivity in coexistence with ferromagnetism .",
    "we have done this for s - wave singlet states and for p - wave triplet states with either esp or osp pairing .",
    "we used these gap equations to study the behaviour of these states as a function of exchange splitting .    for the singlet state we found that our gap equations reproduced the clogston  chandrasekhar limiting behaviour and the phase diagram of the baltensperger ",
    "sarma equation ( neglecting the possibility of an fflo state ) .",
    "we also showed that the singlet gap equation leads to the result that the superconducting order parameter is independent of exchange splitting at zero temperature .",
    "this fact was assumed in the derivation of the clogston ",
    "chandrasekhar limit .",
    "osp triplet states showed a very similar behaviour to the singlet state in the presence of exchange splitting .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the effect of exchange splitting on a superconducting state is determined by whether the state contains osp or esp .",
    "( all singlet states are , by definition , osp states . )    in contrast , esp triplet states show a very different behaviour in an exchange field . in particular there is no clogston  chandrasekhar limiting .",
    "further , @xmath113 is actually increased by exchange splitting because @xmath119 is changed by the exchange splitting and @xmath113 is dependent on @xmath119 .",
    "this effect is well known in @xmath2he , but has previously only been studied in a ginzburg ",
    "landau formalism @xcite .",
    "the gap equations presented here will allow for far more detailed study of both the increase of @xmath113 and for the study of the splitting of the a@xmath117 and a@xmath1 phases by exchange splitting .",
    "if the experimentally occurring ferromagnetic superconductors are esp triplet pairing states , as seems likely from the absence of clogston  chandrasekhar limiting , then these systems will allow for study of this effect at far greater exchange splittings than can be archived with magnetic fields in @xmath2he .",
    "the gap equations presented here will also be useful for studying these materials in their own right , in particular we hope that the will prove useful for identifying the superconducting pairing symmetry of these ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "our formalism is quite general , and can be applied to more realistic band structures and pairing models , although the additional complication of the vector potential will have to be overcome before one can make complete theoretical predictions for these materials .",
