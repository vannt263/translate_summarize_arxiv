    "the aim of this paper is to exhibit the analogy and relationship between two seemingly unrelated theories . on the one hand , the tannakian formalism , giving a duality theory between affine group schemes ( or , more generally , gerbs ) and a certain type of categories with additional structure , the tannakian categories . on the other hand , a general notion of internality in model theory , valid for an arbitrary first order theory , that gives rise to a definable galois group .",
    "the analogy is made precise by deriving ( a weak version of ) the fundamental theorem of the tannakian duality ( theorem  [ tan : main ] ) using the model theoretic internality .",
    "the tannakian formalism assigns to a group @xmath0 over a field @xmath1 , its category of representations @xmath2 . in the version we are mainly interested in , due to saavedra ( @xcite )",
    ", the group is an affine group scheme over a field .",
    "a similar approach works with groups in other categories , the first due to krein and tannaka , concerned with locally compact topological groups .",
    "another example is provided in section  [ dif ] . in the algebraic case ,",
    "the category is the category of algebraic finite - dimensional representations .",
    "this is a @xmath1-linear category , but the category structure alone is not sufficient to recover the group .",
    "one therefore considers the additional structure given by the tensor product .",
    "the tannakian formalism says that @xmath0 can be recovered from this structure , together with the forgetful functor to the category of vector - spaces .",
    "the other half of the theory is a description of the tensor categories that arise as categories of representations : any tensor category satisfying suitable axioms is of the form @xmath2 , provided it has a `` fibre functor '' into the category of vector spaces .",
    "our main references for this subject are the first three sections of  @xcite and  @xcite .    in model theory ,",
    "internality was discovered by zilber as a tool to study the structure of strongly minimal structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "later , poizat realised ( in  @xcite ) that this notion can be used to treat the galois theory of differential equations .",
    "the definable galois correspondence outlined in theorem  [ mod : internality ] has its origins there .",
    "later , the theory was generalised to larger classes of theories ( @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) , and applied in various contexts ( e.g. , @xcite extended the differential galois theory to arbitrary `` @xmath3-groups '' definable in @xmath4 ) .    in appendix b of  @xcite ,",
    "internality was reformulated in a way that holds in an arbitrary theory .",
    "one is interested in the group of automorphisms @xmath5 of a definable set @xmath6 over another definable set @xmath7 .",
    "a set @xmath6 is internal to another set @xmath7 if , after extending the base parameters , any element of @xmath6 is definable over the elements of @xmath7 .",
    "the idea is that under this condition , @xmath6 is close enough to @xmath7 so that the @xmath5 has a chance to be definable , but the requirement that a base extension is required prevents it from being trivial .",
    "the theorem is that indeed @xmath5 is the group of points of a ( pro- ) definable group ( see theorem  [ mod : internality ] ) .",
    "this theory is reformulated again in  @xcite , where the same construction is described as an abstract duality theory between definable groupoids in a theory @xmath8 , and certain expansions of it , called internal covers .",
    "it is this formulation that we use .",
    "the main results of the paper appear in sections  [ alg ] and  [ dif ] . in section  [ alg ]",
    "we apply internality to prove the fundamental result on tannakian categories ( theorem  [ tan : main ] ) .",
    "this is done by constructing , for a tensor category @xmath9 an internal cover @xmath10 of @xmath11 .",
    "models of this theory correspond , roughly , with fibre functors on @xmath9 .",
    "the theory of internality provides a definable group in @xmath11 , and this is the group corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "the other parts of the theory follow from the galois theory , and from the abstract duality theory of  @xcite .    the result we prove is weaker than the original theorem  [ tan : main ] in the following ways .",
    "first ,  [ tan : main ] states that a certain functor is representable by an affine algebraic group , but we only prove that its restriction to the category of fields agrees with such a group ( see also question  [ q : functor ] below ) .",
    "second , our proof works only in characteristic @xmath12 .",
    "finally ,  [ tan : main ] is covered , in part , by the general model theoretic statement  [ mod : action ] , but the rest of the proof is only sketched , since it is not significantly different from the proof found in  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the proof has the advantage that it is simple and more `` geometric '' than the algebraic one .",
    "it also has the advantage that the method is applicable in a more general context .",
    "one such application , concerning usual galois theory , is briefly discussed in remark  [ alg : galois ] .",
    "a more detailed application appears in section  [ dif ] , where we define the notion of a differential tensor category , and explain how the same model theoretic approach gives an analogous theorem ( theorem  [ dif : main ] ) there ( though the method again gives a weaker result , in the same way as in the algebraic case ) .",
    "a similar result , using a somewhat different language , was first obtain using algebraic methods in  .",
    "it seems obvious that similar formalisms are possible in other contexts ( e.g. , difference fields , real closed fields ) .",
    "we note that , though model theory provides a general method of proof of such results , the right notion of a `` tensor category '' is new , and can not be deduced directly from this method .",
    "the first two sections contain background material .",
    "section  [ mod ] contains some general notions from model theory , as well as a statement of internality result , and some auxiliary remarks on it .",
    "section  [ tan ] gives a short review of tannakian categories , with enough terminology and results to state the main theorem .",
    "both sections are provided with the hope that the paper will be accessible to a wide audience ( both within model theory and outside it ) , and that the information contained there will provide the reader with enough information to at least get a feeling for the nature of the results .",
    "we mention also that there is a result in the other direction : it is possible to define the analogue of internal covers and recover a group object in a general categorical context , and recover the model theoretic result from it .",
    "this result will appear separately .",
    "several questions ( some vague ) remain unanswered in the paper .",
    "the main ones , from my point of view , are the following .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    as described in remarks  [ alg : deligne1 ] and  [ alg : deligne2 ] , the main results of  @xcite have very natural model theoretic translations .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that there is a model theoretic proof , especially of the main theorem ( which translates to having no new structure on @xmath11 ) , but i could not find it .",
    "the case when @xmath9 is neutral appears to be easier from the algebraic point of view ( and is proven already in  @xcite ) , but model theoretically i do nt know how to do even this case .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    conversely , the results and methods of  @xcite and  @xcite seem to suggest that one can do `` model theory '' inside a tannakian category ( and perhaps more generally in a tensor category ) . for example , as can be seen from  [ alg : equiv ] , the statement of  [ tan : main ] can be viewed as saying that @xmath9 has elimination of quantifiers and elimination of imaginaries .",
    "i think it would be interesting to find out if this makes sense , and make it precise .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    [ q : functor ] what is a general model theoretic machinery to prove results as in  [ alg : mainexr ] , but in full generality ? ( rather than just for fields ) .",
    "this can also be asked purely in terms of functors ( though in this context there is probably no answer ) : assume there is a functor @xmath13 from @xmath1-algebras to sets ( or groups ) , and a scheme ( or group scheme ) @xmath0 with a map @xmath14 that is a bijection on fields .",
    "what are conditions on @xmath13 that allow us to deduce that this map is an isomorphism ?",
    "i would like to thank ehud hrushovski for suggesting this approach , and for help along the way .",
    "i would also like to thank anand pillay for his interest and useful remarks .",
    "in this section , we recall some notions from model theory . some elements of the model theoretic language are briefly sketched in  [ mod : intro ] through  [ mod : imag ] .",
    "these appear in most texts on model theory , for example @xcite or  @xcite .    in the rest of the section , we recall the main model theoretic tool that we use , namely internality , and the definable galois group .",
    "we shall , for the most part , follow the presentation and terminology from  @xcite .",
    "the only new results in this section appear after the statement of the theorem ( theorem  [ mod : internality ] ) , though most of them are implicit in  @xcite .",
    "[ mod : intro ] we briefly recall that a _ theory _ is collection of statements ( axioms ) written in a fixed formal language , and",
    "a _ model _ of the theory @xmath8 is a structure consisting of an interpretation of the symbols in the language of @xmath8 , in which all the axioms of @xmath8 hold .",
    "for example , the theory @xmath15 of algebraically closed fields can be written in a language containing symbols @xmath16 , and a model of this theory is a particular algebraically closed field .    a _ formula _ is written in the same formal language , but has _ free variables _ , into which elements of the model can be plugged .",
    "for the example of @xmath17 above , any finite collection of polynomial equations and inequalities can be viewed as a formula , but there are other formulas , involving quantifiers .",
    "any such formula @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 contain all free variables of @xmath20 ) thus determines a subset @xmath21 of @xmath22 , for any model @xmath23 , namely , the set of all tuples @xmath24 for which @xmath25 holds .",
    "two formulas @xmath20 and @xmath26 are _ equivalent _ if @xmath27 for all models @xmath23 .",
    "an equivalence class under this relation is called a _ definable set _ ( so , in this paper",

    "if @xmath23 is the model of some theory , the set of all statements ( in the underlying language ) that are true in @xmath23 is a theory @xmath28 , and @xmath23 is a model of @xmath28 .",
    "we will assume all our theories to be multi - sorted , i.e. , the variables of a formula can take values in any number of disjoint sets .",
    "in fact , if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are sorts , we view @xmath31 as a new sort .",
    "in particular , any definable set is a subset of some sort . by a statement such as `` @xmath32",

    "the proof is completely analogous to the proof of the corresponding statement  [ tan : main ] , which is given , respectively , in  [ alg : mainexr ] ,  [ alg : equiv ] and  [ alg : mainrec ] .",
    "we only mention the differences .    for  ( [ dif : mainexr ] ) , the main point is again that @xmath590 is isomorphic to @xmath591 ( functorially in @xmath205 ) , where @xmath592 is a definable copy of the internality group inside @xmath207 .",
    "the sort @xmath207 is now a pure differentially closed field , so the result follows from the fact that any definable group in @xmath4 is differential algebraic ( @xcite ) .",

    "we only mention the definition of the evaluation map ( using the notation there ) : it is enough to the evaluation on ( the interpretation of ) @xmath120 , since the rest is as in the algebraic case .",
    "we define the evaluation @xmath594 by induction on @xmath41 : @xmath595 is the usual evaluation . if @xmath596 , the map @xmath597 is a derivation on @xmath598 , and so defines a linear map from @xmath599 to @xmath207 .",
    "inspection of the definition of @xmath600 ( for vector spaces ) reveals that this map descends to a linear map @xmath601 on @xmath600 .",
    "the rest of the proof is the same as in  @xcite , namely , the kolchin closed set @xmath593 is determined by the finite dimensional linear space spanned by the defining equations , and this space is an elements of some grassmanian , which is , in turn , a closed subset of some projective space ."
