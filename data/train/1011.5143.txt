    "due to the wide variety of their ground states , ce based ternary intermetallic compounds have attracted large attention during the last years .",

    ", the competition between kondo and rkky interactions results in different ground states depending on their relative magnitudes  @xcite : the formation of long - range magnetic order depends quadratically on the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath7 , while the development of a local kondo ground state depends exponentially on @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless effective exchange coupling parameter @xmath7 correlates the exchange interaction , @xmath8 , between @xmath5 localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons with the electronic density of states at the fermi level , @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , small values of @xmath7 favor long range magnetic order , while for large values of @xmath7 a paramagnetic kondo - screened ground state is anticipated . at the borderline between these two regimes",
    "non fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior has been observed .",
    "+ apart from this classical scenario other mechanisms , e.g. , via a change of the effective spin degeneracy @xmath10 may occur .",
    "the latter was analyzed by coleman @xcite .",
    "this additional mechanism seems to be relevant for the ground state of the heavy fermion system ceni@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xcite . in the substitution series",

    "for the synthesis of the samples of ceni@xmath11co@xmath12ge@xmath1 materials of high purity were used : ce : 4n ; la : 3n8 ( ames mpc ) ; ni : 4n5 ; co : 4n8 ; ge : 5n .",
    "they were prepared by arc melting under argon atmosphere followed by an annealing process at @xmath13c for two weeks inside an evacuated quartz tube .",

    "between @xmath33 and @xmath34 the low temperature susceptibility decreases dramatically . this huge change in the magnetic properties",
    "can not only be caused by a marked increase of the kondo screening but also by a reduction of the effective spin degeneracy .",

    "the two samples with a small co concentration ( @xmath24 and @xmath46 ) exhibit a similar behavior but with enhanced residual resistances at low temperature .",

    "the kondo lattice behavior disappears and the residual resistance increases further .",
    "the cusps in the electrical resistivity for @xmath45 indicate the afm transition , already observed in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data .",
    "+ in order to study the crossover from single - ion kondo behavior towards long range afm order , the magnetic contribution to the specific heat @xmath40 ( fig[fig2]b ) was extracted by subtracting the total specific heat of the corresponding la compounds with unoccupied @xmath5 states . for ceni@xmath0ge@xmath1 two pronounced maxima around 5 und 35k",
    "are obtained .",
    "the first schottky - like anomaly is associated with a quasi - quartet ground state characterized by a subtle splitting into two doublets @xmath47 and @xmath48 which interacts with the kondo screening on the same energy scale @xcite .",
    "the second maximum is associated with the @xmath49 cf doublet . with increasing co concentration",
    "the upper maximum remains almost constant , while the lower maximum shifts to higher temperatures ( 10k for @xmath25 ) .",
    "this refers to a reduction of the effective spin degeneracy @xmath10 like it was found in ceni@xmath11cu@xmath12ge@xmath1 @xcite and appears to be the driving force for the afm ordering . for @xmath50 the afm phase transition at low temperatures",
    "is observed .",
    "studying the ground state evolution in ceni@xmath11co@xmath12ge@xmath1 , we found already for small co concentrations @xmath31 a logarithmic divergence of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath51 , as it is typical for a qcp transition .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic susceptibility of these compounds shows a flattening instead of the logarithmic divergence which would be expected in case of a temperature independent sommerfeld - wilson ratio @xmath52 .",
    "a further increase of the co content @xmath18 leads to a significant pronounced increase of the kondo temperature but nonetheless afm order appears in this system .",
    "the latter is counter - intuitive to the usual doniach picture and seems to result from a reduction of the effective spin degeneracy @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that a similar scenario is observed also in ceni@xmath11cu@xmath12ge@xmath1 @xcite , where the @xmath53 electron count changes in the opposite way , clearly suggests that the reduction of the effective spin degeneracy away from the paramagnetic quasi - quartet ground state in ceni@xmath0ge@xmath1 plays a crucial role in the formation of long range afm order in the system ceni@xmath54ge@xmath1 ( @xmath55 cu , co ) .",
