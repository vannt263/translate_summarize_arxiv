    "in chirally stacked few layer graphene systems @xcite two sublattice sites , one in the top layer and one in the bottom layer , are disconnected from the near - neighbor interlayer hopping network and partially isolated .",
    "this geometric feature leads to a gapless semiconductor with weakly dispersive conduction and valence band edges , and therefore to an enhanced role for electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "the low - energy sublattice degree - of - freedom in chirally stacked @xmath1 layer graphene can be viewed as a @xmath2 pseudospin , with @xmath3-pseudospins corresponding to top layer states and @xmath4-pseudospins to bottom layer states . in this language",
    "the conduction and valence band eigenstates at wavevector @xmath5 have @xmath6 plane pseudospin orientations , _",
    "i.e. _ they have equal weight in top and bottom layers , and azimuthal angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . a number of years ago we predicted@xcite on the basis of an unrestricted hartree - fock mean - field - theory that these circumstances would lead to ground states with pseudospin order , and in particular to a state in which the pseudospins rotate out of the @xmath6 plane by a @xmath9-dependent polar angle toward either the north or the south pole , breaking layer - inversion symmetry @xcite and inducing a gap @xcite in the charged excitation spectrum .",
    "recent bilayer experimental work @xcite has yielded clear evidence for broken symmetry states , although a consensus on the character of their order has not yet been achieved . at the same time a substantial body of theoretical work @xcite has used a variety of different approaches to study bilayer graphene .",
    "the general consensus of this work is that the ground state is a pseudospin ferromagnet .",
    "it has become clear however that because of quantum fluctuations that are not captured by mean - field theory , the gapped state competes closely with a gapless anisotropic state in which the net pseudospin alignment is in the @xmath6 plane , not the @xmath10 direction .",
    "this paper addresses that competition .",
    "as we will explain in more detail later , some features of the bilayer graphene system present awkward obstacles to theory . first among these is the property that the conduction and valence bands are weakly dispersive only over the small part of the brillouin zone where inter - layer tunneling plays an essential role . elsewhere in the brillouin zone interaction effects",
    "are expected to be similar to those in single - layer graphene , producing strong quasiparticle velocity enhancements,@xcite and spectral weight rearrangements,@xcite but not order .",
    "the small number ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12-electrons per carbon atom in the strongly correlated region of momentum space is an obstacle for theories of the ordered state that are based primarily on a lattice model of graphene .",
    "the narrow momentum - space distribution of the most important virtual states also creates difficulties for continuum models because it makes the physics sensitive to the long - range of the coulomb interaction . in this paper",
    "we report on calculations in which lattice effects are completely ignored and the long - range of the coulomb interaction is not treated explicitly . in our view",
    "the continuum approach we use is strongly motivated by the low - density of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "our use of short - range interactions can be crudely justified by appealing to screening considerations , and arguing that the momentum - independent interaction parameters we use represent an average over the relevant portion of momentum space . although not fully rigorous in this sense , we believe that the conclusions we reach by following this approach systematically are nevertheless valuable and consistent with recent experimental work.@xcite    this paper elaborates on ideas presented in a series of closely related earlier papers @xcite in which the ground state is estimated on the basis of perturbative renormalization group ( prg ) calculations .",
    "these calculations differ among themselves most essentially in the approximate ways they account for lattice scale physics and long - range interactions . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the model we study and restate some identities and observations that are useful in developing its perturbation theory .",
    "section iii presents new results for the prg interaction flows of this model , emphasizing the role of exchange interactions between electrons with the same spin and valley states and commenting on the flavor number ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the interaction parameter flows . in section",
    "iv we explain how the prg pseudospin susceptibilities , whose divergences suggest the character of the low - temperature order , depend on the renormalized interaction strengths . finally in section v we present our conclusions and discuss the relationship of our work to experiments and to other theoretical work on this system .",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) is described approximately at low - energies by the @xmath13 version of the chiral band hamiltonian:@xcite @xmath14c_{{\\bm q}\\beta i}.\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : band ] ) @xmath15 are pauli matrices which act on the ( greek ) layer labels and @xmath16 is a spin - valley flavor label .",
    "we have used the notation @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here @xmath19 labels @xmath20 and @xmath21 valleys located at inequivalent brillouin zone ( bz ) corners and @xmath22 is wavevector measured from the bz corner .",
    "it is convenient to perform a rotation in blg pseudospin space@xcite in the @xmath23 valley to eliminate the valley dependence of the band hamiltonian , in order to make our discussion more concise in the following sections .",
    "the blg chiral band hamiltonian applies @xcite at energies smaller than the interlayer hopping scale @xmath24 mev and larger than the trigonal warping scale @xmath25 mev .",
    "we discuss the important role of trigonal warping in the band - structure later .",
    "the physics discussed in this paper applies to bilayers when @xmath13 and partly generalizes to @xmath26-layer chirally ( abc ) stacked graphene multilayers,@xcite although the chiral band hamiltonian @xmath27 applies over narrower ranges of energy for larger @xmath26 .",
    "we will focus our attention on the @xmath13 case hereafter .",
    "@xmath28 can be viewed as specifying a momentum @xmath29-dependent effective magnetic field that acts on the bilayer layer - pseudospin degree - of - freedom : @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and the orientation angle of @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding matsubara green s function is @xmath35^{-1 } = { \\mathcal g}_{{\\bm q}\\rm s}(i\\omega_{\\rm n})+{\\mathcal g}_{{\\bm q}\\rm",
    "t}(i\\omega_{\\rm n } ) \\ ; { \\bm n } \\cdot { \\bm \\sigma}\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 whereas @xmath39 . when expressed explicitly as a @xmath40 matrix , @xmath41 the off - diagonal _ triplet _ component captures processes in which electrons propagate between layers",
    "; its momentum - orientation dependent phase factor plays an essential role in the one - loop prg calculations described in the next section .",
    "the frequency sums which appear in loop diagrams are readily evaluated : @xmath42 these two results express the property that fluctuations involve interband transitions . in the prg",
    "each loop diagram is multiplied by appropriate interaction constants ( discussed below ) and then integrated over momentum labels near the model s flowing cutoff @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the blg density - of - states per flavor . the second frequency sum in eq.([eq : freq_sum_gf ] ) vanishes in the long - wavelength static limit because it has contributions from intra - band particle - hole excitations only . because @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 , this integral diverges logarithmically when the high - energy cut - off",
    "is scaled down by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "the prg calculation is therefore very similar to the corresponding calculation for a 1des .",
    "this rather surprising property of blg is directly related to its unusual band structure which yields fermi points rather than fermi lines in neutral systems , and quadratic rather than linear dispersion.@xcite",
    "in systems with short - range interactions , finite momentum ( gradient ) corrections are irrelevant in the rg flows .",
    "we therefore ignore the wave - vector transfer dependence of scattering processes starting already at the @xmath13 chiral model s ultraviolet cut - off energy @xmath49 . in the low - energy continuum model of blg electrons carry spin , and both layer and valley pseudospin labels . in a scattering event ,",
    "both the two incoming and two outgoing particles can therefore have one of eight labels and the general scattering function therefore has @xmath50 distinct values , even when gradient corrections are ignored .",
    "the number of distinct coupling constants in the rg flow equations is much smaller , however , because many values are zero and others are related to each other by symmetry .",
    "one simplification is that interactions conserve spin and , in the continuum model , both layer and valley pseudospin at each vertex .",
    "the role of spin in our model is therefore equivalent to the role of valley . we do however choose to allow the interaction strength between electrons in different ( @xmath51 ) layers to be weaker than that between electrons in the same ( @xmath52 ) layer so that the interactions are layer - pseudospin dependent .",
    "the internal loops in the prg calculation contain two fermion propagator ( green s function ) lines . because we seek a momentum - independent effective interaction we simplify the calculation by evaluating the coarse - graining correction to the effective interaction for the case where all incoming and outgoing electrons are at the dirac point .",
    "( as we comment in the discussion section , this approximation is made less innocent by the layer pseudospin structure of the band eigenstates . )",
    "these propagators conserve both spin and valley pseudospin , but as we have seen above , not the layer pseudospin . from eq.([eq : phasefactor ] ) we see that a phase factor @xcite @xmath53 appears when a propagator transfers electrons between layers .",
    "unless these layer transfers enter an equal number of times in each direction , the integrand in a feynman diagram will contain a net phase factor related to chirality and vanish upon angular integration of the virtual momentum .",
    "the total layer number ( the @xmath10 component of layer pseudospin ) is therefore also conserved.@xcite this property combined with flavor invariance limits the number of independent interaction parameters to three , two for interaction processes involving electrons in the same layer or different layers that conserve layer index , and one for interaction processes between electrons in different layers accompanied which interchange layer indices .",
    "we refer to the three distinct processes , illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma ] , as @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .    if flavor invariance is broken , either due to microscopic lattice effects that violate @xmath57 invariance or due to broken symmetries , the number of interaction parameters increases .",
    "for example , if the bare interactions are spin and valley dependent in an arbitrary way , the number of independent _ antisymmetrized _ interaction parameters increases from three to ten:@xcite @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61,@xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in this notation",
    "the first label follows the convention explained above for the layer pseudospin dependence of the interaction , whereas the second and third labels refer to valley and spin respectively , and distinguish the interaction between particles with the same ( @xmath52 ) or different ( @xmath51 ) spin or valley .",
    "the number of entries in this list of interactions has been reduced by two by appealing to fermi statistics for the case of @xmath68 interactions , those between particles with the same spin and valley labels . in that case interchanging the labels of outgoing electrons yields an indistinguishable and canceling amplitude for particles in the same layer .",
    "although we can choose to retain @xmath69 in the rg flows , it can not contribute to any physical observable .",
    "similarly , since @xmath61 and @xmath70 are interchanged by reversing outgoing labels they differ only by a sign and it is sufficient to retain one parameter . the number of independent interacting parameters in the analysis by vafek @xcite and by lemonik _ et al._,@xcite who impose the symmetry of the underlying blg crystal but do not explicitly account for antisymmetrization is nine . for @xmath57 invariant models the number of parameters is three , but antisymmetrization allows us to retain only one coupling constant in the single flavor ( @xmath71 ) case , and the physical implications of the flowing interactions are more apparent if we do so.@xcite a convenient choice @xcite is to retain @xmath61 .",
    "we take the view that the underlying lattice @xcite is unlikely to play an important role in determining whether the broken symmetry state is gapped @xcite or gapless,@xcite though it is key to selecting @xcite between distinct gapped states @xcite that are equivalent in an @xmath57 invariant model . therefore , the number of interactions parameters that appear in the calculation described below is three in the general case with unbroken flavor invariance and one for the special case of @xmath71 .      in this subsection",
    "we explore the similarities and differences between blg and 1des s by temporarily neglecting the spin and valley degrees - of - freedom .",
    "we choose the single effective interaction parameter to be @xmath72 .",
    "a prg analysis determines how the bare interaction at the @xmath73 scale , @xmath74 , is renormalized by integrating out the high energy fermion degrees of freedom . at one loop level",
    "the coarse - graining contributions to the effective interaction are described @xcite by the three higher order diagrams labeled zs , zs , and bcs .",
    "the internal loops in these diagrams are summed over the high - energy labels .",
    "the main merit of the prg is that it treats all virtual processes on an equal footing ,    it is well known that in a 1des the zs loop vanishes while the zs and bcs diagrams cancel , implying that the interaction strength does not flow to large values and hence that neither the cdw repulsive interaction nor the bcs attractive interaction instabilities predicted by mean - field theories survive the quantum fluctuations they neglect .",
    "the key features of blg order physics can be understood in terms of two properties of these one - loop diagrams ; ( i ) the particle - particle ( bcs ) and particle - hole ( zs , zs ) loops have the same logarithmic divergences as in the 1des case in spite of the larger space dimension and ( ii ) the zs loop , which vanishes in the 1des case , is finite in the blg case and the bcs loop vanishes instead .",
    "both of these changes are due to the layer pseudospin triplet contribution to the single - particle green s function as we explain below .",
    "the net result is that interactions flow to strong coupling even more strongly than in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the key step in one - loop prg calculations is identifying the coupling factors attached to the loop in each diagram .",
    "since only opposite layer interactions need to be retained for @xmath71 models , all scattering functions have two incoming particles with opposite layer labels and two outgoing particles with opposite layer labels , much like the 1des case.@xcite the external legs in the scattering function feynman diagrams are labeled by the layer index ( @xmath75 top layer and @xmath76 bottom layer ) .",
    "the corresponding labels for the 1des case @xcite are the chirality , @xmath77 for right - going and @xmath78 for left - going .",
    "we refer to these as the single - particle labels below when a comment refers to both 1des and blg cases .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zszs1](a ) , at the upper vertex of the zs diagram the incoming and the outgoing @xmath79 particles induce a @xmath80 particle - hole pair in the loop , while the incoming and outgoing @xmath80 particles at the lower vertex induce a @xmath79 particle - hole pair .",
    "the zs contribution is absent in the 1des case @xcite because propagation is always diagonal in interaction labels .",
    "however , this correction survives for blg because the single - particle green s function has a triplet contribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq_sum_gf ] ) ) which is off - diagonal in layer index . here",
    "we find @xmath81    the zs loop shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zszs1](b ) corresponds to repeated interaction between a @xmath79 particle and a @xmath80 hole .",
    "this is the channel responsible for the 1des mean - field cdw instability @xcite in which coherence is established between @xmath77 and @xmath82 particles.@xcite in both 1des and blg cases it has the effect of enhancing repulsive interactions .",
    "its evaluations for the two cases correspond quite closely , because this loop diagram involves only particle - propagation that is diagonal in interaction label .",
    "we find that @xmath83    the bcs channel corresponds to repeated interaction between the two incoming particles . in the 1des case",
    "the contribution from this loop ( see fig .  [ fig : bcs1 ] ) cancels the zs contribution@xcite , leading to marginal interactions and luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "this same kind of bcs correction for blg reads @xmath84    in the blg case there is an additional bcs loop contribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bcs2 ] ) in which the incoming @xmath79 and @xmath80 particles both change layer labels before the second interaction .",
    "this contribution is possible because of the triplet pseudospin propagation and , in light of eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq_sum_gf ] ) , gives a bcs contribution that has the opposite sign compared to the normal contribution : @xmath85    it follows that the bcs loop contribution is absent in the blg case because @xmath86 therefore , at one - loop level , the renormalization of interlayer interaction is @xmath87 these results and the comparison with 1des s are summarized in table  [ table : one ] and imply the following rg flow equation for blg : @xmath88 if we follow the flows from the model s microscopic cutoff we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath74 is the bare interaction .",

    "these results verify our original theoretical predictions @xcite and are consistent with recent experimental observations in dual - gated ultra - clean suspended blg devices.@xcite    finally , we point out that an interlayer potential breaks @xmath57 invariance in the @xmath113 case , leading to a range of stability for a state in which three flavors are polarized toward one layer and one flavor toward the other layer when an ordered state appears . for instance , a possible mass term in a mean - field theory with broken layer - inversion symmetry can be proportional to @xmath187 .",
    "this gapped state breaks parity inversion and time reversal symmetries , favored by small interlayer electric and magnetic fields @xcite that break @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "the difference between this state and other spontaneously broken symmetry states can be further appreciated as follows in our full model with _ approximated _ @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "this state reduces the full symmetry to @xmath188 with three goldstone modes , in contrast to the three possible states in flavor spin channel that break the symmetry down to @xmath189 with four goldstone modes , and there is no soft mode in the flavor charge channel .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to shed light on the pseudospin ferromagnet ground state of blg by carrying out a conventional perturbative renormalization group calculation for a model with @xmath57 invariance in spin - valley space , and examining interaction corrections to spin and charge pseudospin susceptibilities . the prg flows lead to strong layer interchange scattering processes which favor gapless nematic ( @xmath6-plane pseudospin ferromagnet ) ground states , competing with the gapped ( @xmath10-direction pseudospin ferromagnet ) states favored by intra - flavor exchange interactions and predicted @xcite by mean field theory .",
    "the role of exchange is especially dominant in the single - flavor @xmath71 case in which the prg flow equations lead to divergent interactions which vanish when projected onto the many - fermion hilbert space .",
    "for @xmath71 the interactions enter observable only in the combination @xmath128 that is uniquely allowed by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we conclude that the most likely ground states are gapped spin - channel ising pseudospin ferromagnets , in agreement with some @xcite recent experiments , although the competition becomes closer when the number of flavors is larger , and quite close for the physically relevant @xmath113 case . according to our estimates ,",
    "broken symmetry states appear at energy scales slightly larger than those at which trigonal warping effects in the single - particle hamiltonian @xcite start to have a large influence on the band structure , splitting the vorticity @xmath13 vortex of the chiral model into four @xmath190 dirac points .",
    "the strength of our conclusions is limited by our neglect of the long - range character of coulomb interactions and by the fact that our one - loop prg calculations become unreliable once the effective interactions flow to strong values , _",
    "i.e. _ once @xmath191 .",
    "the details of our calculations are conventional and in particular evaluate the loop corrections to scattering amplitudes for the case in which both incoming and out - going momenta are at the dirac point .",
    "this simplification is normally justified by the irrelevance of gradient corrections to the effective interactions .",
    "as we now explain , in the case of blg , this approximation likely overestimates the strength of the @xmath56 layer interchange interactions .",
    "consider for example the zs process which is non - zero because of the triplet layer off - diagonal contribution to the green s functions , as we have approximated in eq.([eq : zs ] ) .",
    "when the incoming electrons have finite momenta @xmath192 and @xmath193 , the momentum arguments of the virtual states in the loop diagram are @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the triplet propogator phase factors which are integrated over @xmath196 in the loop correction to @xmath56 therefore becomes @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "notice that this phase factor has a singular dependence on @xmath192 and @xmath193 at small @xmath196 and that the approximation we have used previously , in which we replace @xmath199 by zero , is valid only for @xmath200 .",
    "when the phase factors are taken into account the @xmath56 scattering amplitude has an additional phase factor which will average to a value smaller than one in physical observables like the pseudospin susceptibilities .",
    "it therefore appears to us that our calculation likely overestimates the strength of the interactions which favor the nematic state .",
    "the gapped states have the interesting property that they support large momentum space berry curvatures,@xcite which can lead to interaction - induced quantum hall effects .",
    "the regions of momentum space near both k and k valleys flavor contribute @xmath201 to the hall conductivity for each spin .",
    "when all flavors make a contribution of the same sign , the total hall conductivity is exactly @xmath202 .",
    "this gapped bilayer state is therefore a quantized anomalous hall ( qah ) insulator @xcite with chiral edge states . because of its nontrivial overall orbital moment@xcite",
    "the qah state is favored by a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the state in which the sense of layer polarization is opposite for opposite spins and for opposite valleys does not break time - reversal symmetry and has a mean - field interaction terms with an effective spin - orbit coupling @xcite that leads to a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state with zero charge hall conductivity .",
    "the qsh state has helical edge states protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "its @xmath203 classification in an interacting @xmath1-layer chiral graphene is given by@xcite @xmath204 .",
    "when lattice effects @xcite are taken into account , inter - valley exchange weakly favors the layer - antiferromagnet ( laf ) @xcite state .",
    "( that observation does not definitively make the case for this particular state , since inter - valley exchange could be less important than correlation effects . ) for a laf state , @xmath205 even though time - reversal symmetry is broken by opposite spin polarizations on the top and bottom layers . in a continuum model that neglects lattice effects and has @xmath57 symmetry ,",
    "the three states are all members of the continuous family of degenerate broken symmetry states that is signaled by divergence of @xmath186 .",
    "in addition to their difference in edge state properties , the qah , qsh and laf states also exhibit different responses @xcite to zeeman fields which couple to spin and can be realized in the absence of orbital coupling by applying magnetic fields parallel to graphene layers . in the qah case ,",
    "the ground state is unchanged but the quasiparticle gap is reduced , vanishing when the zeeman - coupling strength is equal to the ground state gap via a mechanism reminiscent of the clogston limit in superconductors .",
    "the qsh and laf states respond to zeeman fields by establishing noncollinear spin states within each valley and evolving toward an unusual kind of exciton condensate in the strong zeeman - coupling limit .",
    "the quasiparticle gap of qsh and laf states is however independent of zeeman - coupling strength drawing a sharp distinction with the qah case .",
    "it is therefore possible to use zeeman responses and edge state signatures to identify the character of the bilayer ground state experimentally.@xcite on the other hand , the three states respond very similarly to an electric field between the layers , which can induce first order transitions at which the total layer polarization jumps.@xcite this state favored by an interlayer electric field is a quantum valley hall state with zero hall conductivity but , in the absence of scattering which mixes valleys counterpropagating valley - resolved edge states .",
    "we note that a small electric field between the layers can also possibly stabilize a state in which one flavor is polarized in a sense opposite to the other three and charge , valley , and spin hall conductivities are all nonzero.@xcite    one consequence of the above mentioned spontaneous quantum hall effects @xcite in each valley is that the gapped states have a very simple adiabatic evolution with magnetic field @xmath80 in which the gap remains open , but the carrier density at which the gap appears varies with field .",
    "the total filling factor inside the gap at finite @xmath80 is @xmath206 for a state with a hall conductance equal to @xmath207 at zero field .",
    "the topological character @xcite of the gapped states in blg is induced @xcite by weak bare electron - electron interactions and is enhanced by the nearly flat bands with chiral pseudospin textures , and is distinct from the @xmath203 topological insulators @xcite that require strong intrinsic spin - orbital coupling .",
    "although interaction - induced topological states apparently do not occur in single - layer graphene , as proposed @xcite on the basis of extended hubbard models with at least finite interaction strength , it appears quite possible that they do occur in bilayers via a weak interaction instability.@xcite    there are three previous articles @xcite which discuss similar rg calculations .",
    "reports equivalent rg flow equations for the @xmath57 invariant model in terms of interaction parameters that are related to ours by @xmath208 and @xmath123 .",
    "several references have started their rg flows from effective interactions which include symmetry - allowed corrections due to lattice effects . ref .",
    "attempts to account for the long - range of the coulomb interaction by explicitly accounting for screening and then replacing the coulomb amplitude by an average value , and estimates the ground state by applying mean - field theory to interactions from prg flows that have been truncated at an intermediate interaction strength .",
    "all calculations recognize the competition between nematic and gapped states , but small differences in approximations or in estimates of bare coupling parameters have lead to different final conclusions .",
    "we note that the recent elaborations@xcite of the calculations which motivated nematic state proposals@xcite recognize that gapped states@xcite are also a possibility .    although these calculations , like ours , shed light on the physics at play in determining the ground state , it is difficult to make definitive conclusions based on theory alone and we must ultimately appeal to experiment . here",
    "the situation is also confusing .",
    "some experimental studies @xcite of high - quality suspended bilayers appear to reveal gaps whose size , carrier - density - dependence , and temperature - dependence , is roughly consistent with mean - field - theory predictions.@xcite these observations are consistent with the conclusions of this paper . on the other hand this behavior",
    "is not observed in all samples , even in samples which appear to be similar to the gapped samples .",
    "one experimental study@xcite focuses on the magnetic - field @xmath80 dependence of the gap at filling factor @xmath209 in a sample which does not show a gap at @xmath210 .",
    "the anomalous weak @xmath80 persistence of the @xmath209 gap in this experiment appears to be consistent with earlier studies by yacoby and collaborators.@xcite although interpreted as evidence for the nematic study , the persistence of the @xmath209 gap is , it appears to us , equally consistent with a field - driven crossover or transition to a gapped @xmath211 state .",
    "although this gap is likely not the ground state at @xmath210 it is favored at filling factor @xmath209 , because its gap is then pinned to the fermi level . in this interpretation the increased conductance observed at weak fields in ref .   would be associated with a first order transition @xcite between @xmath211 and @xmath212 states which induces a network of current - supporting @xcite domain walls.@xcite    similar spontaneously broken symmetry physics@xcite is also likely in thicker high quality graphene films with chiral ( abc ) stacking order.@xcite in an @xmath1-layer chiral stack,@xcite the low - energy sublattice sites are localized in the outermost layers , @xmath213 and @xmath214 . hopping occurs between these two sites via an @xmath1-step virtual process which leads to @xmath215 energy dispersions and an @xmath216 berry phase . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the low - energy bands are increasingly flat and the pseudospin chirality larger , at least when weak remote hopping processes are neglected , leading to larger opening for many - body interaction effects .",
    "in the simplified chiral model , the density of states @xmath217 diverges as @xmath218 approaches zero for @xmath219 whereas it remains finite for @xmath180 . in the prg language",
    ", this difference corresponds to the fact that the short - range interactions at tree level are marginal for @xmath180 but relevant for @xmath219 . since @xmath220 at tree level ,",
    "as discussed in section iii - c , it seems that gapped spontaneous quantum hall states @xcite which break layer - inversion symmetry and produce large momentum space berry curvatures can occur in multilayers as well .",
    "future experimental and theoretical work will be necessary to sort out the competition between interactions and remote hopping terms in the hamiltonian .",
