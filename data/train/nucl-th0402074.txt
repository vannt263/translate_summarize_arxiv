    "we start with the discussion of the recent _ ab initio _ variational calculations of light nuclei up to the mass number @xmath0 of the argonne - illinois group @xcite .",
    "they take the two nucleon interaction obtained from the scattering data and add the three body interaction so as to reproduce the binding energies of the three nucleon systems .",
    "they reproduce very nicely the light nuclei including the excited states .",
    "we have now a technique to calculate many body quantum systems with mass of about 10 .",
    "these calculations provide another surprising result that the pion matrix element is about @xmath1 of the whole attraction .",
    "this importance of the pion degrees of freedom in nuclei should have experimental consequences .",
    "for this we show in fig .",
    "1 the recent gamow - teller distributions obtained by ( @xmath2he , t ) reaction at rcnp @xcite . due to the ultra high resolution , we find very small peaks at low excitation energy .",
    "considering the very simple structure of the gamow - teller operator , @xmath3 , it is surprising to have so many peaks in the low excitation region .",
    "we will show that this fragmentation of the gt strength is a natural consequence of the role of pion in finite nuclei .",
    "we mention also that ratios of the longitudinal and transverse spin response functions are also the indication of the role of pion in finite nuclei .",
    "these observations motivated us to examine the possibility of the finite pion mean field in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "we keep the pion interaction term in the lagrangian and introduce the finite pion mean field .",
    "the introduction of finite pion mean field makes the breaking of parity and the mixing of protons and neutrons in the intrinsic single particle state .",
    "we mention also that the pion source term contains the derivative of the spin - isospin density distribution and hence needs spatial variation .",
    "we have calculated various n = z nuclei in the periodic table without the coulomb term with the inclusion of the pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "we have found that the pion mean field becomes finite and the energy gain due to the pion term behaves as the nuclear surface , which indicate that pion contribution comes from the nuclear surface .",
    "we have found also that the pionic phase transition is not so strong and need a special care in the treatment of the finite pion mean field .",
    "this preliminary study of the role of pion in finite nuclei suggests us to look into the parity and the charge projection and also the variation of the symmetry projected wave function . in order to see the structure of the projected wave function , we write here the case of parity projection to simplify the notation .",
    "we discuss here the role of the pion by performing the parity projection from the symmetry broken intrinsic state .",
    "we write the single particle state with mixed parity in a simpler form as @xmath4 here , @xmath5 denotes a parity mixed single particle state expressed as a linear combination of @xmath6 , some parity state ( we call it as a normal parity state ) and @xmath7 , the opposite parity state ( abnormal parity state ) .",
    "we write the intrinsic state with these single particle states up to the fermi surface and with all the magnetic sub - shells filled as @xmath8 this intrinsic state has the total spin 0 because all the magnetic sub - shells are filled , but the parity is mixed",
    ". the first term , @xmath9 , in ( [ eq : state ] ) has the positive parity and corresponds to the ground state in the zeroth order .",
    "the second term has the negative parity , since each normal parity state , @xmath10 , is replaced by an abnormal parity state , @xmath11 for all occupied @xmath10 .",
    "hence , if we say the first term as the 0p-0h state , then the second term is a coherent 1p-1h state with @xmath12 spin parity .",
    "the third term consists of 2p-2h states with a pair of 1p-1h states with @xmath12 spin parity and therefore has @xmath13 spin parity .",
    "the next term has three 1p-1h states with @xmath12 spin parity and therefore has @xmath12 spin parity and so on .",
    "hence the positive parity projection @xmath14 would provides the state with even number of 1p-1h states with @xmath12 spin parity .",
    "this means that the positive parity projection provides 2p-2h states as the major correction terms . in this sense ,",
    "the parity projected mean field theory with pion condensation is related strongly with the finding of kaiser et al .",
    ", who claim that a large attraction arises from 2p-2h configurations due to the pion exchange interaction @xcite . the negative parity projection @xmath16 would provide the state with odd number of 1p-1h states with @xmath12 spin parity .",
    "this is the brother state having the quantum number of @xmath12 to the @xmath13 ground state .",
    "the ground state consists of highly correlated particle",
    " hole states .",
    "we perform the parity and charge projection calculations for the alpha nucleus @xcite .",
    "the role of the symmetry projection is extremely important for the quantitative account of the pionic correlations for finite nuclei .",
    "the chiral symmetry is the most important symmetry in the strong interaction .",
    "we studied the role of chiral symmetry on the property of finite nuclei using the chiral sigma model @xcite .",
    "the famous lagrangian is the one of gell - mann and levy , where the pion field appears symmetrically with the sigma field @xcite .",
    "we start with the linear sigma model with the omega meson field , which is defined by the following lagrangian , @xmath18 the fields @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the nucleon , sigma and the pion fields . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the sigma model coupling constants . here",
    "we have introduced the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term , @xmath24 , and in addition the mass generation term for the omega meson due to the sigma meson condensation as the case of the nucleon mass in the free space @xcite .",
    "we call this model as the extended chiral sigma model hereafter .    in a finite nuclear system",
    ", it is believed to be essential to use the non - linear representation of the chiral symmetry .",
    "this is because the pseudoscalar pion - nucleon coupling in the linear sigma model makes the coupling of positive and negative energy states extremely strong and we have to treat the negative energy states very carefully .",
    "we can derive the non - linear sigma model by introducing new variables in the polar coordinates from the rect - angular coordinates and making a suitable transformation , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "we further implement the weinberg transformation for the nucleon field as @xmath27 .",
    "after several steps , we obtain the sigma - omega model lagrangian in non - linear representation given as follows , @xmath28 where we set @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the effective mass of the nucleon and omega meson are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we take the following masses and the pion decay constant as , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "then , the other parameters can be fixed automatically by the following relations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the strength of the cubic and quadratic sigma meson self - interactions depends on the sigma meson mass through the following relation , @xmath41 , in the chiral sigma model .",
    "the mass of the sigma meson , @xmath42 , and the coupling constant of omega and nucleon , @xmath43 , are the free parameters .",
    "we calculate first infinite matter using this lagrangian in the mean field approximation without the pion mean field @xcite . the sigma meson mass and the omega nucleon coupling",
    "are adjusted to reproduce the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "we found that the incompressibility came out to be very large , k @xmath44 mev instead of k @xmath45 mev .",
    "we found also the vector and scalar self - energies were about half as large as those in the case of the rmf(tm1 ) .",
    "we discuss now the consequence of these properties of nuclear matter on the finite nuclei .",
    "we discuss the properties of finite nuclei in terms of the extended chiral sigma model .",
    "we show the results of binding energies per particle of n = z even - even mass nuclei from n = 16 up to n = 34 in fig .",
    "we take all the parameters of the extended chiral sigma model as those of the nuclear matter except for @xmath43 = 7.176 instead of 7.033 for overall agreement with the rmf(tm1 ) results @xcite . for comparison , we calculate these nuclei within the rmf approximation without pairing nor deformation . the rmf(tm1 ) provides the magic numbers , which are seen as the binding energy per particle increases at n = z = 20 and 28 . on the other hand , the extended chiral sigma model without the pion mean field provides the magic number behavior only at n = z = 18 instead of n = z = 20 .",
    "we show also the result of the finite pion mean field , which is achieved by making the single particle states have mixed parity with definite total spin .",
    "the inclusion of the pion mean field provides the magic number at n = z = 28 .    in order to see why the difference between the two models for the lagrangian arises",
    ", we discuss the single particle levels for the two models . in the case of the tm1 parameter",
    "set , the shell gaps appear clearly at n = 20 and 28 .",
    "the magic number at n = 20 is due to the central potential , while the magic numbers at n = 28 comes from the spin - orbit splitting of the 0f - orbit .",
    "this is definitely due to the fact that the vector potential and the scalar potential in nuclear matter are large so as to provide the large spin - orbit splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "the single particle spectrum of the extended chiral sigma model is quite different from this case as seen in fig .",
    "most remarkable structure is that the @xmath46 orbit is strongly pushed up . due to this reason the @xmath47 orbit becomes the magic shell at n = 18 and the magic number appears at n = 18 instead of n = 20 .",
    "we see also not strong spin - orbit splitting and hence there appears no shell gap at n = 28",
    ". the first discrepancy could be due to the large incompressibility as seen in the nuclear matter energy per particle .",
    "the other is due to the relatively small vector and scalar potentials in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "we discuss the effect of the finite pion mean field on the single particle energies .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the single particle spectra for various nuclei .",
    "we state again that the single particle states have mixed parity with definite total spin indicated beside each level .",
    "we see clearly the large energy differences between the spin - orbit partners to be produced by the finite pion mean field as the energy differences become maximum for nuclei at n = 28 .",
    "the pion mean field makes coupling of different parity states with the same total spin .",
    "the @xmath48 state repels each other with the @xmath49 state and therefore the @xmath48 state is pushed down and the @xmath49 state is pushed up .",
    "the next partner is @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath50 state is pushed down , while the @xmath47 state is pushed up .",
    "the next partner is @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath51 state is pushed down , while the @xmath52 state is pushed up .",
    "this pion mean field effect continues to higher spin partners .",
    "this coupling of the different parity states with the same total spin due to the finite pion mean field causes the splittings of the spin - orbit partners as seen clearly for the @xmath53 spin - orbit partner , @xmath54 spin - orbit partner and @xmath55 spin - orbit partner in @xmath56ni .",
    "it is extremely interesting to see that the appearance of the energy splitting between the spin - orbit partners for the case of the finite pion mean field is caused by completely a different mechanism from the case of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we showed the recently observed high resolution gamow - teller distributions of @xmath57zr(@xmath2he , t ) reaction in fig.1 .",
    "the finite pion mean field makes the intrinsic single particle states have mixed parities .",
    "hence , in addition to the natural shell model type gt excitation , there should appear many tiny gt peaks , whose excitation energies are related with the pion mean field strength .",
    "we are working on the parity and the charge projection for the gt excitation spectra .",
    "we discuss qualitatively also other observables to be explained by the finite pion mean field .",
    "there is the famous missing single particle strength problem , in which the s - wave component is largely missing .",
    "the experiment is the electron scattering with @xmath58pb and @xmath59tl .",
    "the difference between these two charge distributions is compared with the expected single particle @xmath60 wave function .",
    "particularly , the strength at the nuclear center expected from the @xmath60 wave function is missing by almost 30% .",
    "this experimental data is strongly related with the parity mixing of the intrinsic single particle state , where @xmath61 state should have an admixture from @xmath62 state .",
    "the magnetic moments are largely deviated from the schmit values . if the intrinsic single particle states have some total spin with mixed parity , then the magnetic moment of that orbit ought to have a value in between the schmit values .",
    "there are many other observables to be explained qualitatively by the finite pion mean field causing parity mixing .",
    "we have discussed the role of chiral symmetry in terms of the chiral sigma model for the description of finite nuclei . we have applied the chiral sigma model with finite pion mean field to finite nuclei and found that the nucleon mass is reduced by about 20% .",
    "the single particle levels reflected the bad feature of the nuclear matter property as having a too strong incompressibility .",
    "we could reproduce the j - j magic number due to the finite pion mean field , which provides a mechanism of providing the splitting between spin - orbit partners .",
    "all the observables related with the spin and isospin should be related with the finite pion mean field",
    ". we have to work out the projection of the parity and the charge numbers for quantitative description of finite nuclei ."
