    "<S> , for instance , we find the gap structure of @xmath45 and @xmath46 superconducting states summarized in table  [ tab : gap_structure ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .the gap structure for @xmath45 and @xmath46 gap functions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we demonstrate the results of group theory ( table  [ tab : gap_structure ] ) using a three - dimensional single - orbital tight - binding model for @xmath1 . eight ir atoms per unit cell and three types of asoc are taken into account  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the @xmath47-wave order parameter  @xcite which belongs to the @xmath45 representation of the point group @xmath40 , @xmath48 and the @xmath49-wave order parameter  @xcite which belongs to the @xmath46 representation , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a @xmath52 identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the pauli matrices representing the spin , sublattice , and layer degrees of freedom , respectively .    the quasiparticle energy dispersion in the superconducting state @xmath56 is obtained by diagonalizing the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath57 the results of numerical calculations are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mppm_s - wave ] and [ fig : mppm_d - wave ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that only @xmath58 region is colored in the figures : @xmath59 region is colored by black and @xmath60 region by pink .            </S>",
    "<S> the gap structure of the two superconducting states reproduces the nodal structure in table  [ tab : gap_structure ] . in both @xmath47-wave and @xmath49-wave cases , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are consistent with the group theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the gap nodes in figs .  [ fig : mppm_s - wave ] and [ fig : mppm_d - wave ] are protected by nonsymmorphic space group symmetry . note that exceptional cases of the gap classification in table  [ tab : gap_structure ] appear in some accidentally degenerate region  @xcite . for example , we see such unexpected gap structures on the @xmath61 plane  @xcite .    as introduced previously , both theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite suggest @xmath49-wave superconductivity analogous to cuprates  @xcite . in this case , a horizontal line node appears on the zf ( @xmath29 ) in contrast to the usual @xmath49-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the gap opening at the other zfs ( @xmath30 ) is also nontrivial because the usual @xmath49-wave order parameter vanishes not only at bps but also at zfs . </S>",
    "<S> these nontrivial gap structures are protected by the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry .    _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 state  </S>",
    "<S> _ we now turn to the @xmath5 state of sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 . in this case , the method of gap classification used above is not applicable since there is no symmetry operation connecting @xmath34 to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , cooper pairs do not need to be formed between @xmath34 and @xmath35 states , which indicates the emergence of the fflo superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the fflo state is stabilized in the @xmath5 state as shown below .    before going to the main result , here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath5 order can be regarded as an odd - parity magnetic quadrupole ( mq ) order , which results in the asymmetry in the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> although the crystal symmetry of sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 is @xmath40 , it reduces to @xmath62 in the @xmath5 ordered state . here , the odd - parity irs of @xmath40 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) are subduced to representations of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> since only @xmath67 contains the fully symmetric ir of @xmath62 ( @xmath68 ) , the @xmath5 order belongs to @xmath67 representation of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this ir permits time - reversal - odd basis functions : @xmath69 in the real space , and @xmath70 in the momentum space . in the real space </S>",
    "<S> , the basis function represents an odd - parity mq ( @xmath71 ) order  @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the normalized spherical harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath5 order contains the component of a mq order , though it may include a toroidal dipole order proportional to @xmath74  @xcite . in the momentum space , </S>",
    "<S> the linear @xmath70 function makes the band structure asymmetric along the @xmath70 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we actually confirm the asymmetry of the band structure using our tight - binding model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is understood by considering the symmetry operations preserved in the @xmath5 state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we also notice a twofold degeneracy in the band structure protected by symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these features of band structure resemble mq state in the zigzag chain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis identifies the @xmath4 magnetic order as an even - parity magnetic octupole ( mo ) order with @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the superconductivity in the @xmath5 state . </S>",
    "<S> we can clarify the superconducting state near the transition temperature by linearizing the bdg equation while avoiding the numerical limitations of the full bdg equation . </S>",
    "<S> the linearized bdg equation is formulated by calculating the superconducting susceptibility , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the bosonic matsubara frequency , and @xmath78 represents the sublattice @xmath21 , respectively ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sr2iro4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the creation operator of cooper pairs has been introduced as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where we assume the local @xmath47-wave superconductivity for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 is the annihilation operator of electrons with spin @xmath82 on the sublattice @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath84 susceptibility matrix @xmath85 is obtained by the @xmath86-matrix approximation  @xcite , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the @xmath47-wave on - site attraction , and @xmath89 is the irreducible susceptibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition occurs at the temperature @xmath0 where @xmath90 diverges . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the criterion of the superconducting instability is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath93 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 shows the maximum at @xmath95 , since energy bands are symmetric with respect to @xmath96 and @xmath97 even in the @xmath5 state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : mpmp_sus ] shows the @xmath98 dependence of @xmath99 at @xmath100 . in the normal state ( @xmath101 ) , since the system preserves the inversion symmetry , @xmath92 has a peak at @xmath102 regardless of the presence or absence of the asoc [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mpmp_sus](a ) ] . on the other hand , in the @xmath5 state ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath92 shows the maximum at a finite @xmath98 when the asoc exists , while conventional @xmath105 state is stable in the absence of the asoc [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mpmp_sus](b , c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result reveals that the fflo state is favored by the asoc in the odd - parity @xmath5 magnetic ordered state , despite the absence of the macroscopic magnetization required for the conventional fflo state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in the large moment state ( @xmath106 ) , three local maxima are observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mpmp_sus](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior resembles the band - dependent fflo state in the one - dimensional zigzag chain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a part of the bands mainly causes the superconductivity , while the other bands are weakly superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> the nonuniform state with a large @xmath107 should be regarded as the pair - density - wave state  @xcite rather than the fflo state .     in ( a ) the normal state ( @xmath101 ) , ( b ) the small moment @xmath5 state ( @xmath103 ) , and ( c ) the large moment @xmath5 state ( @xmath106 ) . </S>",

    "<S> is respectively assumed to be @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 in the absence of the asoc , while it is @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 in the presence of the asoc.,width=264 ]    _ summary  _ in this letter , we investigated the superconductivity of doped sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 in the two magnetic states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the @xmath4 ( mo ) state , </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath47-wave and @xmath49-wave superconductivity shows nontrivial line nodes protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry on the bz boundary . in the case of @xmath49-wave superconductivity , gap opens on the vertical bz face unlike the ordinary @xmath49-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the nodal gap by nonsymmorphic magnetic symmetry was studied in toy models  @xcite . in a realistic model for sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 , however , we have clarified not only nontrivial line nodes but also unexpected gap - opening . on the other hand , in the @xmath5 state </S>",
    "<S> , the fflo state is stabilized irrespective of the magnitude of antiferromagnetic moment , because the band structure asymmetrically deforms . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric band structure and resulting fflo superconductivity are attributed to the symmetry of the @xmath5 order which is identified as the odd - parity mq order . </S>",
    "<S> the fflo state caused by the mq order does not need the external magnetic field , which means the `` pure fflo state '' free from vortices .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest doped sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 in the mo state as a platform of unconventional nodal superconductivity by nonsymmorphic space group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the realization of parity - violating multipole and fflo superconductivity are proposed beyond the toy model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results point to nontrivial interplay of magnetic multipole and superconductivity in the strongly spin - orbit coupled systems .    </S>",
