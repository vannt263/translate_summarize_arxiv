    "a study of stellar populations and stellar dynamics in the galactic bulge ( gb ) is important for understanding how bulges formed , what are their populations , gravitational potential and structure .",
    "several gravitational microlensing survey groups have found hundreds of events towards the galactic center and disc ( eros : @xcite ; ogle : @xcite ; @xcite ; macho : @xcite ; moa : @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thousands are expected in the upcoming years by moa , ogle - iii and other collaborations .",
    "the data from such microlensing surveys is useful to study the galactic structure by measuring the microlensing optical depth ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) and the proper motions of stars ( @xcite ) , and well suited for numerous other scientific projects ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , as is well known , the extinction due to the dust is very significant towards the gb .",
    "this affects the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the field and makes a separation of stellar populations difficult . to correct for these effects the measurements of the extinction in these fields are crucial .",
    "@xcite made all sky extinction map using cobe / dirbe data , which overestimate the extinction towards the gb because of background dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite constructed @xmath19-band extinction maps of the galactic central region with a resolution of @xmath20 by using @xmath21 and @xmath19 photometry of the upper giant branch stars in denis and 2mass data respectively",
    ". some determinations of the extinction towards baade s window have been performed with a number of different techniques , including those of stellar simulation ( @xcite ) , mean magnitudes of red - clump stars ( @xcite ) , the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae stars ( @xcite ) and magnitude of the k - giants ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale extinction map of the galactic bulge was made by using the mean colour of all stars in the macho project photometry ( @xcite )    @xcite proposed a method to investigate the ratio of total to selective extinction based on two - band photometry of red clump giants ( rcgs ) .",
    "the rcgs are the equivalent of the horizontal branch stars for a metal - rich population , i.e. , relatively low - mass core helium burning stars .",
    "rcgs in the galactic bulge occupy a distinct region in the colour magnitude diagram ( @xcite and references therein )",
    ". the intrinsic width of the luminosity and colour distribution of rcgs in the galactic bulge is small , about 0.2 mag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cmd is used to obtain the quantitative values of the offset on the cmd between the different subfields , caused by differential extinction .",
    "they used rcg - dominated parts of the cmds for determining the offsets , the clump being seen at fainter magnitudes and redder colours in subfields with higher extinction .",
    "they applied this method to the ogle - i data and then found the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied this method to the ogle - i data to obtain differential extinction @xmath2 and reddening @xmath0 in a @xmath23 region of baade s window , with resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "they estimated @xmath25 . @xcite and @xcite applied this method to ogle - ii ( @xmath26 with resolution of @xmath27 ) and moa ( @xmath28 deg@xmath29 with resolution of @xmath30 ) data respectively .",
    "they first made a reddening map for their fields because determining the reddening @xmath0 ( horizontal shift in the cmd ) is easier than @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( vertical shift in the cmd ) .",
    "then the extinction map was calculated according to the following formulae :    @xmath31    with `` standard '' values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the mean @xmath34 colours of gb rcgs and rr lyrae , dereddened with stanek s map , are redder than colours of their nearby counterparts .",
    "@xcite summarized possible explanations of these discrepancies , and noted that the simplest and the most plausible explanation is a non - standard interstellar extinction .",
    "the discrepancy would vanish if @xmath35 rather than the standard value of @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite showed that there is indeed an anomaly in the extinction law , with @xmath37 , depending on the direction of the line of sight .",
    "in this paper we confirm the anomalous value of @xmath38 , and by using new value , we construct extinction maps for 48 galactic bulge fields observed by the optical gravitational experiment ii ( ogle - ii ; @xcite ) .    in  [ sec :",
    "data ] we describe the data .",
    "we measure the reddening line in  [ sec : aievi ] .",
    "we construct the reddening and extinction maps in  [ sec : extinctionmap ] .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we use the @xmath6 photometric maps of standard ogle template ( @xcite ) , which contain @xmath6 photometry and astrometry of @xmath39 million stars in the 49 gb fields .",
    "positions of these fields ( bul_sc1 @xmath40 49 ) can be seen in @xcite .",
    "we do not use bul_sc44 in this work because most of rcgs in this field are close to , or even below the @xmath1-band detection limit of ogle due to high extinction .",
    "the photometry is the mean photometry from a few hundred measurements in the @xmath3-band and several measurements in @xmath1-band collected during the second phase of the ogle experiment between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "accuracy of the zero points of photometry is about 0.04 mag .",
    "a single 2048 @xmath41 8192 pixel frame covers an area of 0.24 @xmath41 0.95 deg@xmath29 with pixel size of 0.417 arcsec / pixel .",
    "details of the instrumentation setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "to measure the ratio of total to selective extinction , i.e. @xmath42 , we make use of the position of rcgs in the ( @xmath3,@xmath34 ) cmd , as it was done by @xcite , but contrary to @xcite and @xcite , who used the ( @xmath1,@xmath34 ) cmd .",
    "the reddening corrected @xmath3-band magnitude of the rcgs does not vary with colour , while the @xmath1-band magnitude is a function of @xmath34 ( @xcite ) , and using it can lead to systematic errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make a preliminary assumption that the average , reddening corrected rcg colour is constant , @xmath43 , which is approximately the colour of nearby rcgs as measured by hipparcos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean colour @xmath44 and @xmath3-band magnitude @xmath45 of rcgs follow reddening line with a slope @xmath46 and a constant @xmath47 , to be determined for every field    @xmath48    in this section , we measure the slope @xmath49 and brightness of rcgs @xmath50 in eq.[eq : reddningcurve ] , with a low spacial resolution , but with a significant number of rcgs . in the next section",
    ", we measure the colour of rcgs with high spacial resolution by using these @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is because an identification of rcg centroids in @xmath3 is more difficult than in @xmath34 because of the vertical structure of red giants overlapping rcgs in the cmd .    in this section",
    ", there are 2 steps to find the rcg centroids in the cmd . at a first step ,",
    "we divide the field into `` bins '' to take spacial differences of the extinctions into account , then we measure the rough mean colour of rcgs in each bin . at a second step ,",
    "we combine bins with similar rcg colour into group to enlarge the significance of rcgs , then we estimate the rcg centroids by the gaussian fit .    as a first step ,",
    "we divide each field into @xmath51 `` bins '' which have @xmath52 pixels each .",
    "as these `` bins '' are relatively large there may be a considerable differential reddening within them , and the rcg may be elongated along the reddening line .",
    "we select an elongated window within which the rcgs are located , following the reddening line as given by the eq .",
    "( [ eq : reddningcurve ] ) with a width of @xmath53 mag in @xmath3 .",
    "as we do not know the correct reddening slope and the correct magnitude of rcgs , we adopt a broad range of trial values : @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we also adopt a broad range of colours for the search of rcgs , selected to be within @xmath56 ; the boundaries are adjusted for each field to minimize the contamination by blue disk main sequence stars and faint red bulge main sequence stars .",
    "we measure the average @xmath44 in each bin using 2-@xmath57 clipping .",
    "these values are used as the initial values of the rcgs colour in the next paragraph .    in a given bin",
    "we measure the average colour and magnitude of rcgs within the circle with a radius of 0.4 mag in the cmd centered at the colour @xmath44 on the reddening line .",
    "these new average values : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , calculated for all @xmath58 pixel bins , are used to obtain an improved value of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this process is iterated until the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 do not change any more .",
    "we found that this final value for a given ogle field was independent of the first guess in the ranges @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and are roughly the same as the more precise values measured in the second step .",
    "even if we locate the window slightly higher or lower , i.e. @xmath63 in eq.([eq : reddningcurve ] ) , than the true rcg centroid in @xmath3 , we would get roughly same colour as the true rcgs colour because the rcgs colour are very similar to the colours of red giants which are somewhat brighter or fainter than rcgs .",
    "we use only resultant average colour @xmath44 of each bin in the following analysis , to arrange bins in order of their extinction in a given field .",
    "so , as long as we fix the value of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in a given field these colours can be used to arrange the bins .    as a second step",
    "we arrange the bins in a given field in order of extinction by using @xmath44 .",
    "then we combined these bins into groups from low extinction to high extinction until each group is filled by @xmath64 rcgs . given a large number of rcgs in each group of bins we could find the rcgs positions in the cmd for each group independently .",
    "we measured rcgs centroid of each group in the cmd by following three methods :    [ 1 ] in a given group of bins we measure the average colour and magnitude of rcgs within the circle with a radius of 0.3 mag in the cmd , centered at the initial values of colour and magnitude of rcgs .",
    "these new average values are used for new rcg selection .",
    "this process is iterated until the value @xmath44 and @xmath45 do not change any more .",
    "we found these final values do not depend on their initial values which can be given by the rough positions of rcgs in previous section , as long as their real positions are within this initial circle .",

    "groups ( grp ) which have roughly 1,000 rcgs are numbered from 1 in order of increasing extinction .",

    "if we make an ad hoc assumption that the rcg population in baade s window is the same as local , and the distance is 8 kpc , then we may obtain @xmath158 and @xmath159 adopting @xmath160 ( i.e. @xmath161)for the unobserved range @xmath157 .",
    "we do not know if this is plausible or not .",
    "the situation will improve somewhat once detailed @xmath1-band ogle photometry becomes available for rr lyrae stars , and this will make it possible to obtain an independent estimate of the reddening in baade s window .",
    "preliminary analysis of the average photometry of rr lyrae stars seems to indicate that the puzzling brightness of red clump giants may be due to population effects , i.e. their average absolute magnitude in the bulge is somewhat different than it is near the sun .",
    "a much improved analysis will be done when ogle - ii @xmath1-band measurements become available in the next several months . at this time it should be ok to use our maps of differential reddening , but we consider our calibration of zero point to be uncertain .",
    "this implies that at this time our reddening maps are not adequate for a quantitative study of galactic bar structure .    in this work",
    "we leave our extinction maps in the ogle - ii @xmath3-band because the reddening map is urgently needed for various applications , and is already used in some works ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a reader must take care of possible small error mentioned above while using our maps for standard @xmath3-band photometry .",
    "the extinction map is available in electronic format via anonymous ftp from the server _",
    "ftp://ftp.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/extinction/ _ and",
    "_ ftp://bulge.princeton.edu / ogle / ogle2/extinction/_.    these extinction maps of ogle - ii gb fields facilitate the study of the galactic structure with ogle proper motion catalogue ( @xcite ) and microlensing optical depth , and a study of variable stars , but the reader should be aware of the zero point of the extinction may not be accurate .",
    "we intend to improve the quality of the zero points in all fields as soon as individual ogle @xmath1-band measurements of the rr lyrae stars become available .",
