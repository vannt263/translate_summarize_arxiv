    "the non - trivial topology of the configuration space of weinberg - salam theory gives rise to unstable classical solutions , sphalerons @xcite , associated with baryon number violating processes @xcite .",
    "besides the well - known single sphalerons @xcite , weinberg - salam theory allows for sphaleron - antisphaleron systems @xcite , as well as for multisphalerons @xcite .",
    "multisphalerons with axial symmetry have long been known @xcite , but only recently multisphalerons with no rotational symmetry at all have been found @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of these sphalerons are only discrete , and can be identified with the symmetries of platonic solids or crystals .",
    "we therefore refer to them as platonic sphalerons .",
    "related to certain rational maps of degree @xmath0 @xcite , they have many properties in common with platonic monopoles and skyrmions @xcite .    when gravity is coupled to the bosonic sector of weinberg - salam theory , i.e.  to yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory with a higgs doublet , the flat space sphaleron changes smoothly , and a branch of gravitating sphalerons arises @xcite .",
    "this branch bifurcates at a maximal value of the gravitational coupling constant with a second branch , higher in energy . in the limit of vanishing coupling constant",
    ", this second branch ends at the ( lowest ) bartnik - mckinnon solution @xcite of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory .",
    "the coupling of gravity to ym or ymh theory has a very similar effect concerning the existence of classical solutions as the coupling to a scalar dilaton @xcite . for monopoles , arising in ymh theory with higgs triplet , even the maximal values of the coupling constants for gravity and the dilaton",
    "are very close @xcite .",
    "this suggests , that the influence of gravity on the new platonic sphalerons may be to some extend mimicked by the presence of a scalar dilaton .    with the aim in mind to obtain self - gravitating objects , which possess only discrete , platonic symmetries , we therefore here present as a first step in this direction the study of dilatonic sphalerons with only discrete symmetries , corresponding to tetrahedral ( @xmath3 ) and cubic ( @xmath4 ) sphalerons .",
