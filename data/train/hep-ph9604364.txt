    "the problem of neutrino mass and mixing is the central issue of today s neutrino physics .",
    "the study of this problem is associated with the search of new scales in physics .",
    "the investigation of the neutrino mass problem is also connected with the hopes to understand the nature of the dark matter in the universe .    at present",
    "there are several indications in favor of non - zero neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "one indication comes from the solar neutrino experiments . in all four solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ) the observed event rates are significantly lower than the event rates predicted by the standard solar models ( see refs.@xcite ) . after the test of the gallex and sage detectors in special experiments with radioactive @xmath3cr sources @xcite the indications in favor of neutrino oscillations coming from solar neutrino experiments",
    "have become more significant .",
    "furthermore , a phenomenological analysis of the solar neutrino data based on the assumption that there is no neutrino mixing indicates @xcite that the signals due to the @xmath4 neutrinos in the cl - ar and ga - ge experiments are substantially lower than the signals predicted by the standard solar models .",
    "no plausible astrophysical or nuclear physics explanation of this discrepancy has been proposed so far .    the solar neutrino data can be explained by assuming neutrino mixing with the msw effect @xcite or vacuum oscillations @xcite . in the simplest two - generation scheme , with transitions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath5 and @xmath7 , a fit of the data with the msw mechanism",
    "yields the following values for the mixing parameters @xcite : @xmath8 and @xmath9 or @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the neutrino masses ) and @xmath15 is the mixing angle . in the case of vacuum oscillations , a fit of the data yields @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "another indication in favor of neutrino mixing comes from the results of the experiments on the detection of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite . in the kamiokande ,",
    "imb and soudan experiments the ratio of @xmath18-like and @xmath19-like events is less than expected .",
    "the data can be explained by @xmath20 or @xmath21 oscillations with @xmath22 and a large mixing angle .",
    "a third indication in favor of neutrino mixing comes from the possible evidence of @xmath23 transitions reported recently by the lsnd collaboration @xcite ( see , however , also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the explanation of the lsnd data in terms of @xmath24 oscillations requires a value of @xmath25 of the order of a few ev@xmath26 .",
    "finally , neutrinos are very plausible candidates for the dark matter in the universe if their masses lie in the ev region ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "all these indications in favor of neutrino mass and mixing could imply that there are at least three different scales for @xmath25 . in this case , the number of massive neutrinos must be more than three .",
    "let us notice that the results of the lep experiments which proved that the number of neutrino flavors is equal to three ( see ref.@xcite ) do not constrain the number of massive light neutrinos . in the case of a dirac neutrino mass term , the total lepton number is conserved , massive neutrinos are dirac particles and the number of massive neutrinos can be equal to three . in the case of a dirac and majorana neutrino mass term , which is typical for gut models , the total lepton number is not conserved , massive neutrinos are majorana particles and their number is larger than three .",
    "we will consider here short - baseline oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos in two possible schemes , one with mixing of three massive neutrino fields and the other with mixing of four massive neutrino fields . in the case of three neutrinos",
    "we will assume that the neutrino masses satisfy the relation @xmath27 .",
    "in the case of four neutrinos we will assume that @xmath28 .",
    "models with three and four massive neutrinos with this types of mass relations have been considered in the recent articles @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "they are inspired by the experimental indications in favor of neutrino mixing and by astrophysical arguments @xcite in favor of the existence of two practically degenerate neutrinos with masses in the ev range .",
    "these schemes are compatible with the constraints that follow from the r - process production of heavy elements in the neutrino - heated ejecta of supernovae @xcite .",
    "we will derive now the general formulas for neutrino oscillations in the framework of the schemes under consideration , that will be used in the subsequent analyses .",
    "let us consider neutrino oscillations in the case of two groups of neutrinos with close masses .",
    "we will assume that the masses of the second group are much larger than the masses of the first group and only one squared - mass difference is relevant for oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos .    according to a general theory of neutrino mixing ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) ,",
    "the left - handed flavor neutrino fields @xmath29 are superpositions of the left - handed components of ( dirac or majorana ) massive neutrino fields @xmath30 : @xmath31 if the number of massive neutrinos is more than three , we also have @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the matrix of charge - conjugation ) , @xmath35 are right - handed ( sterile ) fields , @xmath36 is a unitary mixing matrix and the index @xmath37 denotes the last ( one or more , depending on the number of the sterile fields ) rows of @xmath36 . from eqs.([101 ] ) and ( [ 102 ] ) it follows that not only transitions among active neutrino states are possible , but also transitions among active and sterile states",

    "let us consider first the schemes with mixing of three massive neutrino fields .",
    "the case of a neutrino mass hierarchy @xmath70 was considered recently in refs.@xcite . in this case the oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos are determined by three parameters : @xmath25 and the two mixing parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in ref.@xcite it was shown that , if a hierarchy of couplings is realized in the lepton sector ( i.e. @xmath71 and @xmath72 are small ) , the lsnd result is not compatible with the results of all the other reactor and accelerator experiments on the search for neutrino oscillations . instead , the result of the lsnd experiment is compatible with the results of all the other experiments in the scheme with the neutrino mass hierarchy ( [ 201 ] ) if @xmath71 is small and @xmath72 is large ( close to one ) . if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , neutrinoless double - beta decay is allowed and for @xmath73 this process can have a rate in the region of sensitivity of the next generation of experiments @xcite .    here",
    "we will consider another possible scheme with three massive neutrinos and one @xmath25 relevant for the oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos .",
    "we will assume the following relation among the three neutrino masses : @xmath74 this scheme was recently discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "in favor of such a scheme there are some cosmological arguments @xcite and some astrophysical arguments concerning the r - process production of heavy elements in the neutrino - heated ejecta of supernovae @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the squared - mass difference @xmath75 is small and is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath5 s on the earth . in this case",
    ", from the general formulas given in section [ intro ] it follows that the oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos are characterized by the values of @xmath76 and two mixing parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath43 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath79 transitions are given by eqs.([110 ] ) and ( [ 112 ] ) with the following oscillation amplitudes : @xmath80    let us consider first the constraints in the scheme under consideration following from the results of reactor and accelerator disappearance experiments .",
    "we will use the exclusion plots obtained in the @xmath81 bugey reactor experiment @xcite and in the @xmath82 cdhs and ccfr84 accelerator experiments @xcite . at fixed values of @xmath25 , the allowed values of the oscillation",
    "amplitudes @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constrained by @xmath85 the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be obtained from the corresponding exclusion curves .",
    "we will consider values of @xmath25 in the interval @xmath88 that covers the range where positive indications in favor of @xmath24 oscillations were reported by the lsnd collaboration @xcite . in this range of @xmath25",
    "the quantities @xmath86 and @xmath87 are smaller than 0.16 and 0.40 , respectively . from eq.([204 ] ) it follows that the parameters @xmath89 at fixed values of @xmath25 must satisfy one of the following inequalities : @xmath90 with @xmath91 in the interval of @xmath25 given in eq.([288 ] ) the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are smaller than 0.04 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "thus , in the wide range of @xmath25 under consideration the mixing parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 can either be small or large ( close to one ) .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath96 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar neutrinos on the earth and that @xmath97 . in this case",
    "the survival probability of the solar @xmath5 s is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the survival probability due to the mixing of @xmath5 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( eq.([209 ] ) can be obtained with the method presented in ref.@xcite ) . from eq.([209 ] ) and from the results of the bugey disappearance experiment it follows that , in the case of a large @xmath94 , we have @xmath102 for all values of the neutrino energy .",
    "such a large lower bound of the @xmath5 survival probability is not compatible with the results of solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",

    "thus , from the results of reactor and accelerator disappearance experiments and from the results of solar neutrino experiments it follows that the values of the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 can lie in one of the following two regions :    1 .",

    "[ n3r2 ] the region of small @xmath94 and large @xmath95 .",
    "the fact that the parameter @xmath94 is small can have important implications for @xmath0h @xmath1-decay experiments and for the experiments on the search for neutrinoless double - beta decay ( @xmath2-decay ) .",
    "the electron spectrum in the decay @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 here q is the energy release , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the electron momentum and energy , @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the fermi function and @xmath110 is a constant . taking into account that @xmath111 and @xmath112 , from eq.([210 ] ) we have @xmath113 this is the usual expression for the @xmath0h @xmath1-decay spectrum from which information about the value of the `` electron neutrino mass '' @xmath114 is extracted .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath114 obtained in the latest experiment @xcite is @xmath115 , which implies that @xmath116    if @xmath100 and @xmath101 contribute to the dark matter in the universe , the masses @xmath117 are in the ev range .",
    "thus , further improvements of the sensitivity of @xmath0h @xmath1-decay experiments could have important implications for the dark matter problem .    if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , neutrinoless double - beta decay of some even - even nuclei is allowed .",

    "the case of cp conservation was already discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us write @xmath123 as @xmath124 if cp is conserved in the lepton sector we have @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the cp parity of the majorana neutrino with mass @xmath127 . from eqs.([215 ] ) and ( [ 216 ] ) it follows that in the case of cp invariance we have @xmath128 furthermore , taking into account that @xmath129 , from the unitarity of the mixing matrix we have @xmath130 from eqs.([214 ] ) , ( [ 215 ] ) and ( [ 218 ] ) we obtain @xmath131 with @xmath132 if cp is conserved , we have @xmath133 or @xmath134 for the same or opposite cp parities of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .    due to eq.([218 ] ) we can write @xmath135 with the help of eqs.([219 ] ) and ( [ 221 ] ) we obtain @xmath136 from eq.([222 ] ) it follows that @xmath137 the boundary values of @xmath138 correspond to cp conservation in the lepton sector : the upper ( lower ) bound corresponds to the case of equal ( opposite ) cp parities of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "information about the value of the parameter @xmath139 can be obtained from the results of solar neutrino experiments .",
    "if @xmath140 , which corresponds to the msw solution with a small mixing angle , we have @xmath141 independently from the value of @xmath142 and from the conservation of cp . in the case of a large value of the parameter @xmath139 , which correspond to the msw solution with a large mixing angle or to the vacuum oscillation solution , in the future it will be possible to obtain information about the violation of cp in the lepton sector if both the @xmath0h @xmath1-decay and @xmath2 decay experiments will obtain positive results .",

    "an important difference between the model considered here and the one considered in section [ sn3 ] is that , in the case of mixing of four massive neutrinos , in the region [ n4r1 ] of small @xmath219 and @xmath221 the result of the lsnd experiment is compatible with the results of all the other neutrino oscillation experiments for @xmath236 .",

    "having in mind the experimental indications in favor of neutrino mass and mixing , we have assumed that in the case of three neutrinos the neutrino mass spectrum is composed of one very light neutrino with mass @xmath249 and two neutrinos with masses @xmath112 in the ev range and a squared - mass difference @xmath250 which is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath5 s . in this scheme ,",
    "the oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos are determined by three parameters , @xmath251 and the two mixing parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 . from the analysis of the results of reactor and accelerator disappearance experiments and from the results of the solar neutrino experiments ,",

    "the oscillations @xmath192 are suppressed and we have obtained rather strong limits for the oscillation amplitude @xmath158 from the results of neutrino oscillation experiments . if the masses @xmath14 and @xmath252 are in the ev region , the effect of neutrino masses could be observed in the next generation of experiments on the measurement of the end - point part of the @xmath0h @xmath1-decay spectrum and in the next generation of experiments on the search for @xmath2-decay . we have shown that , if these experiment find a positive effect , a comparison of the results of the @xmath2-decay experiments and of the @xmath0h @xmath1-decay experiments could allow to obtain direct information about the cp violation in the lepton sector .    in the case of mixing of four massive neutrino fields we have assumed that the spectrum of neutrino masses is composed of two very light masses @xmath253 with a value of @xmath254 which could be relevant for the explanation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and two masses @xmath227 in the ev range with a value of @xmath255 which is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath5 s . since in this model transitions from active to sterile states are possible , the unitarity of the mixing matrix does not put as strong constraints on the oscillation channels as in the case of three neutrinos .",
    "the survival probabilities of @xmath5 and @xmath195 are determined by the two parameters @xmath256 ( with @xmath211 ) . from the results of neutrino oscillation disappearance experiments and the results of solar neutrino experiments",
    "it follows that only two regions of values of the parameters @xmath219 and @xmath221 are allowed : [ n4r1 ] .",

    "if the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is confirmed by future experiments , the region [ n4r1 ] will be excluded .",
    "both schemes considered here are in agreement with the cold and hot dark matter scenario with two practically degenerate neutrinos with masses in the ev range @xcite .    from the results of neutrino oscillation disappearance experiments and solar neutrino experiments it follows that in both schemes considered here the electron neutrino is `` heavy '' .",
    "this means that both schemes are compatible with the constraints coming from the r - process nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - heated ejecta of supernovae @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us remark that , if one of the neutrino mixing schemes considered here is realized in nature , i.e. there is no hierarchy of neutrino masses , the neutrino mass spectrum has a completely different character from the mass spectra of quarks and charged leptons . from our analysis of the results of neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "it follows that there is no hierarchy of couplings among generations in the lepton sector , i.e. the mixing matrix of neutrinos is completely different from that of quarks .",

    "in this appendix we will derive the formula ( [ 307 ] ) for the survival probability @xmath258 of solar neutrinos in the case of mixing of four massive neutrino fields considered in section [ sn4 ] .",
    "in general , the survival probability of solar @xmath5 s can be written as @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the mixing matrix in matter in the point of @xmath5 production in the sun and @xmath261 is the amplitude of @xmath262 transitions when the solar neutrinos travel from the central part of the sun to the earth , @xmath263 being the effective mass eigenstate neutrinos in matter in the point of @xmath5 production in the sun ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ 551 ] ) is valid both for vacuum oscillations and for resonant msw transitions of solar @xmath5 s . in the case of vacuum oscillations @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 \\ ; , \\label{552}\\ ] ] where @xmath267 , and @xmath268 and @xmath269 are the initial and final points of the neutrino trajectory .    in the model under consideration it is assumed that @xmath216 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath5 s and @xmath270 .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath271 is in the range of the msw solution of the solar neutrino problem , the transitions between @xmath272 and @xmath273 in the sun can be strongly affected by solar matter effects . at the same time , the resonance densities associated with @xmath274 and with @xmath275 are much bigger than the density in the sun and therefore the evolution of the @xmath202 and @xmath100 states in the sun is adiabatic ( see the discussions in refs.@xcite ) . as a consequence we have @xmath276 and eq.([552 ] ) is valid for @xmath277 and for @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the survival probability averaged over the neutrino energy spectrum and the region of neutrino production in the sun can be written as @xmath280 using the unitarity of the mixing matrix , we can write eq.([554 ] ) as @xmath281 where @xmath282    in the case of vacuum oscillations eq.([556 ] ) can be written as @xmath283 which is the standard two - generation formula . here",
    "the mixing angle @xmath15 is defined by @xmath284    in the case of msw resonant transitions eq.([556 ] ) can be written as @xmath285 which has the form of the standard two - generation formula . here",
    "@xmath286 is the probability of @xmath287 transitions , which is equal to the probability of @xmath288 transitions .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath15 in vacuum is defined by eq.([558 ] ) and the mixing angle @xmath289 in matter is defined by @xmath290",
    "in this appendix we will derive the formula ( [ 324 ] ) for the survival probability @xmath291 of atmospheric neutrinos in the case of mixing of four massive neutrino fields considered in section [ sn4 ] .",
