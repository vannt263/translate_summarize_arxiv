    "an assumption , that a quasi - bound state could exist in the lightest @xmath1 system , appeared quite a long time ago  @xcite , the interest to the topic was renewed after g - matrix calculations of several few - body antikaonic - nucleus systems  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical calculations were performed after that , mostly focusing on the lightest @xmath0 system .",
    "all of them used different few - body methods and two - body inputs , as a result the predicted binding energies and widths of the quasi - bound state differ substantially .",
    "the theoretical results agree only in the fact , that the quasi - bound state really can exist in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the first faddeev calculations of a quasi - bound state in the @xmath0 system with coupled channels were performed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite than repeated their calculation in  @xcite with energy dependent and independent versions of a chirally motivated @xmath3 potential .",
    "other methods with less accurate treatment of the few - body dynamics were used for investigation of the @xmath0 system after the faddeev calculations , in particular , one - channel variational approaches  @xcite and some others .",
    "the first experimental evidence of a quasi - bound state observation in @xmath0 occurred in the finuda experiment  @xcite at the da@xmath11ne @xmath12 collider .",
    "new analyses of old experiments , such as obelix  @xcite at cern and disto  @xcite at saturne also claim the observation of the state .",
    "the experimental results like the theoretical ones differ from each other , moreover , their binding energies and widths are far from all theoretical predictions . since the question of the possible existence of the quasi - bound state in @xmath0 system is still highly actual , new experiments are being planned and performed by hades  @xcite and leps  @xcite collaborations , in j - parc e15  @xcite and e27  @xcite experiments .",
    "the theoretical works differ not only in methods of treatment of the few - body system and models of two - body interactions , but also in accuracy of reproducing experimental data on @xmath5 scattering and kaonic hydrogen by the @xmath3 potentials .",
    "the @xmath3 interaction , which is the most important for the @xmath1 system , is usually described either by pure phenomenological or by chirally motivated potentials . in particular , our previous calculations of the quasi - bound state in the @xmath1 system  @xcite were performed with an early phenomenological model of @xmath3 interaction . in a series of subsequent works devoted to the @xmath13 system  @xcite more accurate phenomenological models of @xmath3 interaction were constructed and used . the potentials with coupled @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath14 channels reproduce low - energy data on @xmath5 scattering and kaonic hydrogen and have a one - pole and a two - pole structure of the @xmath4 resonance , while the potential from  @xcite has only one pole .",
    "in addition , a chirally motivated @xmath15 potential , which reproduces the experimental data with the same accuracy as the phenomenological ones , was constructed  @xcite .",
    "we used all three potentials in the new calculations of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state and thereby investigated the dependence of the three - body results on the models of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "faddeev equations in ags form and the two - body input , which were used in the calculations , are shortly described in the next section together with the methods of evaluating the binding energy and width of a quasi - bound state .",
    "two methods were used : the direct search of the pole position with contour rotation ( described in subsection  [ contour.sect ] ) and a new method of finding a subthreshold resonance ( [ det_method.sect ] ) .",

    "section  [ zdep.sect ] is devoted to the question of using of an energy dependent potential in few - body equations .",
    "series of additional calculations were performed to investigate the applicability of the `` self - consistent '' method of obtaining an `` averaged @xmath3 energy in @xmath1 system '' used in the variational calculations .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the faddeev equations in alt - grassberger - sandhas form for the three - body system with coupled @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are described in detail in our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "the equations are written for separable two - body potentials , they are properly antisymmetrized .",

    "momentum @xmath25 in  eq.([vsep ] ) describes motion of a pair of particles , while @xmath26 in  eq.([ags_imp ] ) is a momentum of relative motion of a particle in respect to a pair . all additional indices and summations in the eqs .",
    "( [ ags_imp],[vsep ] ) are omitted .",
    "all our potentials are @xmath27-wave isospin dependent ones .",
    "we used three different models describing the @xmath3 interaction , which is the most important for the @xmath1 system .",
    "two phenomenological potentials with one - pole @xmath28 and two - pole @xmath29 structure of the @xmath4 resonance from  @xcite describe directly coupled @xmath3 and @xmath14 channels , while the @xmath30 channel is taken into account effectively through complex value of one of the strength parameters . our chirally motivated @xmath15 potential with three coupled channels is described in i  @xcite .",
    "all three models are equally good in reproducing experimental data on low - energy @xmath5 scattering and kaonic hydrogen . in particular",
    ", they reproduce elastic and inelastic @xmath5 cross - sections and threshold branching ratio @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining threshold branching ratios @xmath32 and @xmath33 are reproduced by the @xmath34 directly , while auxiliary @xmath35 constructed from @xmath32 and @xmath33 is reproduced by the phenomenological potentials instead due to absence of the directly coupled @xmath30 channel .",
    "all three models of @xmath3 interaction give values for @xmath36 level shift and width of kaonic hydrogen , which are in agreement with the most recent experimental results from siddharta collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the remaining two - body potentials , used the three - body calculation , are described in  @xcite .",
    "the two - term tsa - b @xmath37 potential reproduces phase shifts of argonne v18 potential , therefore , is repulsive at short distances .",
    "it also gives proper @xmath37 scattering length , effective range and binding energy of deuteron .",
    "as for the model of @xmath38 interaction , we used the spin independent version of the exact optical potential corresponding to the model with coupled @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels .",
    "the two - channel @xmath40 potential reproduces low - energy experimental @xmath38 and @xmath39 cross - sections , the exact optical @xmath41 potential , which we used , has exactly the same elastic @xmath38 amplitude as the two - channel model .",
    "the position @xmath42 of a quasi - bound state in the three - body problem is usually defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an eigenvalue of the kernel of faddeev equations . in practice",
    "this amounts to solving the equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the determinant of the linear system , obtained after discretization of the integral equations eq .",
    "( [ ags_imp ] ) .",
    "we used two different types of discretization .",
    "one is based on the method of quadratures , another one uses a cubic spline expansion .",
    "all our results obtained with these two methods are equal , coinciding in @xmath47 significant digits .",
    "we also used two methods of searching the complex pole position in a three - body system .      applying the coupled - channel faddeev formalism for the search of @xmath0 quasi - bound state at a complex energy one has to be aware of the specific requirements of finding a three - body resonance pole on the proper riemann sheet .",
    "the problem of proper analytic continuation of the momentum space faddeev equations from the physical energy sheet has an extended literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it has been established , that the correct analytic continuation to the closest unphysical energy sheet can be achieved by moving the momentum integration into the complex plane .",
    "different integration contours were proposed in the literature .",
    "we chose the one suggested in  @xcite , which is a ray in the fourth quadrant of the complex plane .",
    "along the ray the momentum variable @xmath48 from eq.([ags_imp ] ) must satisfy the condition @xmath49 .",
    "deformation of the integration contour in this way ensures , that the complex solution of the equation will be found on the correct energy sheet .",
    "we found also another way to locate the @xmath0 quasi - bound state , which avoids integration in the complex plane .",
    "since the function @xmath46 has a zero at the quasi - bound state position @xmath42 , the function @xmath51 , which enters all amplitudes through the inverse faddeev matrix , can be written as @xmath52 when energy @xmath24 in eq.([1det ] ) is taken on the real axes , the function @xmath53 has a breit - wigner form with @xmath54 accounting for a background . therefore , calculating @xmath46 for real energies @xmath24 , for which the integration on momentum @xmath48 in eq.([ags_imp ] ) can be kept on the real axis , and fitting @xmath53 function to a breit - wigner curve we can get information on the resonance position and width .",
    "obviously , this procedure works only if the resonance is well pronounced , i.e. isolated and not too wide .",
    "fortunately , our @xmath0 quasi - bound state is of this type , as can be seen on fig.[1det.fig ] , where we show the results of applying this method .",
    "the function @xmath53 , calculated on the real energy axis using all three our @xmath3 potentials , is demonstrated .",
    "the breit - wigner fits to the curves are also plotted , however , they are almost indistinguishable from the original lines .",
    "the fits were done with a background function , which is quadratic in energy .",
    "it is remarkable , that the shape of the @xmath53 function on the real energy axis does not depend on the actual method of discretization of the integral equations .",
    "we obtained almost strictly coinciding breit - wigner parameters from quadratures and cubic spline expansion discretizations in spite of the fact , that the determinants themselves were strongly different .",
    "since complex root finding is a difficult task , the breit - wigner values can serve as a good starting point for it . on the other hand , it is a good test of the directly found pole position , which is free from the possible uncertainty of the proper choice of the riemann sheet .",
    "ccc & direct pole search & bw fit of @xmath55 + with @xmath56 , @xcite & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + with @xmath59 , @xcite & @xmath60 & @xmath61 + with @xmath62 , @xcite & @xmath63 & @xmath64 +",
    "pole positions of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state , obtained from the direct search in the complex plane and from the breit - wigner fit with three our @xmath3 potentials are shown in table  [ pole1det.tab ] . the one- @xmath56 and two - pole @xmath59 phenomenological interaction models from @xcite together with the chirally motivated potential @xmath62 from @xcite were used .",
    "it is seen , that the results obtained using the two methods of pole position search are quite close , indicating , that the methods supplement each other .",
    "ccc & @xmath65 & @xmath66 + & & + with @xmath56 , @xcite & 53.3 & 64.8 + with @xmath59 , @xcite & 47.4 & 49.8 + with @xmath62 , @xcite & 32.2 & 48.6 + & & + sgmr  @xcite & 55.1 & 100.2 + iks  @xcite with @xmath67 & 44 - 58 & 34 - 40 + iks  @xcite with @xmath68 & 9 - 16 & 34 - 46 + & 67 - 89 & 244 - 320 + & & + dhw  @xcite & 17 - 23 & 40 - 70 + bgl  @xcite & 15.7 & 41.2 +    the most striking feature of the results , shown in the table , is the large difference between the binding energies of the quasi - bound states obtained from the phenomenological , especially the one - pole version , and the chirally motivated @xmath3 potentials .",
    "this probably is due to the energy dependence of chirally motivated model of the interaction .",
    "the available experimental data , to which all three potentials were fitted with approximately equal accuracy are close to the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "while the phenomenological models of the @xmath3 interaction are unchanged , when the @xmath0 quasi - bound state is calculated , the energy dependence of the chirally motivated potential reduces the attraction for the lower energies in the @xmath1 quasi - bound state region , thus producing states with less binding .",
    "it is not quite clear , why the widths of the two - pole models of @xmath3 interaction are almost coinciding , while the one - pole @xmath56 potential gives much larger width .",
    "the difference might be connected with the different pole stucture of the corresponding @xmath3 interaction models : while the highest poles of the two - pole @xmath59 and chirally motivated @xmath62 potentials lie close to each other , the pole position of the one - pole phenomenological model is much closer to the @xmath3 threshold ( see table 2 of @xcite and eq.(12 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "such a large difference between the `` phenomenological '' and `` chiral '' results is opposite to the results of i  @xcite , where low - energy @xmath13 scattering and @xmath36 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium were calculated using the same equations ( surely , inhomogeneous ones with correspondingly changed quantum numbers ) and input . in that case",
    "the three - body observables obtained with the three @xmath3 potentials turned out to be very close each to other",
    ". it can be due to the fact , that those three - body values were calculated near the @xmath1 threshold while the @xmath0 pole positions are far below it .",
    "our three binding energy @xmath65 and width @xmath66 values of the @xmath0 quasi - bound state are compared in table  [ bgam.tab ] with other theoretical results .",
    "in particular , the results obtained in our previous faddeev calculation  @xcite , the most recent results of alternative calculation using the same equations  @xcite with several chirally motivated @xmath3 potentials are shown together with two variational results  @xcite . the new result with one - pole @xmath56 potential has binding energy , which is very close to our previous one  @xcite , which used the same model of @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the difference in widths could be explained by low accuracy of the older @xmath3 potential .",
    "coupled - channel ags equations were solved in  @xcite with chirally motivated energy dependent and independent @xmath3 potentials .",
    "therefore , in principle , their calculation with the energy dependent version of the @xmath3 potential @xmath68 should give a result , which is close to ours with chirally motivated model of interaction @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen , however , that only their width is comparable to our @xmath66 , while the binding energy obtained in  @xcite is much smaller than ours .",
    "the reason of the difference is , probably , an approximation used in the chirally motivated models used in  @xcite .",
    "namely , the energy - dependent square root factors , responsible for the correct normalization of the amplitudes , are replaced by constant masses .",
    "this can be reasonable for the highest @xmath3 channel , however , it is certainly a poor approximation for the lower lying @xmath14 and @xmath30 channels .",
    "we checked the role of this approximation in the ags calculations , the obtained pole position , corresponding to the quasi - bound state , @xmath69 really has much smaller binding energy than the original one , see table  [ bgam.tab ] . the remaining difference between the results",
    "could be explained by the higher accuracy of reproducing experimental @xmath5 data by our chirally motivated @xmath3 potential .",
    "we did not find the second pole in the @xmath0 system reported in  @xcite in the corresponding region for either of the three @xmath3 potentials .",
    "there are a few problematic points in  @xcite , too .",
    "first of all , the variational calculation was performed solely in the @xmath1 sector , therefore the absorption into the @xmath2 and @xmath70 channels should be taken into account through the imaginary part of an optical or complex potential .",
    "we checked an accuracy of use of the exact optical @xmath3 potential , which gives exactly the same elastic @xmath3 amplitude as the original potential with coupled channels , and performed one - channel ags calculations for three our @xmath3 potentials .",
    "the `` exact optical '' pole positions @xmath71 differ only slightly from the full coupled - channel results from table  [ pole1det.tab ] .",
    "therefore , the one - channel faddeev calculation with exact optical potential could be quite satisfactory approximation to the full calculation with coupled channels .",
    "the authors of variational calculations  @xcite used a one - channel @xmath3 potential , derived from a chirally motivated model of interaction with many couped channels .",
    "however , the potential can not be called `` the exact optical '' since gauss form - factors were additionally introduced into the potential .",
    "it is not quite clear , how this one - channel potential is connected to the original one and whether it still reproduces some experimental @xmath3 data .",
    "moreover , the position of the quasi - bound state was determined in  @xcite only from the real part of this @xmath3 potential , as a real bound state , while the width was estimated as the expectation value of the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "this , essentially perturbative treatment of the inelasticity might be justified for quite narrow resonances , but the quasi - bound state under consideration is certainly not of this type .",
    "another serious problem of the variational calculations is their method of treatment of the energy dependence of the @xmath3 potential in the few - body calculations .",
    "our results already show that the energy dependence of the chirally motivated model of @xmath72 interaction has a crucial effect on the @xmath0 quasi - bound state position .",
    "therefore , the question deserves special attention .",
    "the basic problem is , that two - body energy is not a well defined quantity in more - than - two - body systems .",
    "therefore some special effort is needed if energy dependent interactions are used in few - body calculations .",
    "fortunately , momentum space faddeev equations provide a framework , offering an exact treatment of this problem .",
    "it is seen from eqs.([ags_imp ] ) and ( [ vsep ] ) that the argument of the energy dependent part @xmath18 of the two - body @xmath19-matrix @xmath73 comes from embedding the two - body @xmath19-operator in three - body space . the kinetic energy of the third , non - interacting particle with momentum @xmath48 in eq.([z2 ] )",
    "is extracted from the three - body energy @xmath24 .",
    "this is the so called spectator mechanism , through which two - body dynamics enters the three - body problem in faddeev approach .",
    "the representation of a few - body system as an auxiliary subsystem of two interacting particles and a third , non - interacting spectator allows an exact definition of the two - particle energy at which the two - body @xmath19-matrix has to be evaluated .",
    "it is seen from eq.([ags_imp ] ) , that since the spectator momentum @xmath48 is an integration variable , a range of two - particle energies @xmath74 enters the three - body calculation .",
    "our results , shown in the previous section , were obtained in this way , allowing for a `` dynamical '' dependence on two - body energies .",
    "however , we made an exception : since the coupling constants depending on @xmath75 obviously become non - physical for @xmath76 , we `` froze '' the energy dependence at the @xmath30 threshold , where @xmath77 , and kept these values , when @xmath48 was further increased under the integral .",
    "we think , that this procedure is non - contradictory to the spirit of chiral interactions , whose energy dependence is probably meant in a certain region near the channel thresholds , and definitely not below the lowest open channel .",
    "we checked , that this freezing does not change the pole position , situated far above the @xmath30 threshold .",
    "when chiral interactions are used in non - faddeev few - body calculations , their energy dependence has to be accounted for . to treat this problem in coordinate space variational calculations , which can be performed only with fixed - energy two - body interactions ,",
    "a method was invented in  @xcite and then used in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption , that a definite two - particle energy @xmath78 exists , for which the chiral interaction fixed at this value produces the same @xmath0 quasi - bound state , as the energy dependent one .",
    "a `` self - consistent '' iterative procedure was suggested , according to which the expectation value of a certain operator , calculated with the trial wave function and called `` average @xmath3 energy in @xmath1 system '' , should give @xmath78 .",
    "apart from the fact that the quantity , with respect to which self - consistency is sought , is not free of some amount of arbitrariness , no single hint concerning the applicability or accuracy of this method is given .",
    "we decided to investigate the effect of fixing the energy of the @xmath3 coupling functions on the @xmath1 quasi - bound state position .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[ekn_fixed.fig ] , where the @xmath0 quasi bound state pole trajectories , calculated with a fixed @xmath78 in the couplings of our chirally motivated @xmath3 potential are plotted .",
    "the curves correspond to changing @xmath79 up to @xmath80 mev , keeping @xmath81 fixed .",
    "@xmath82 values are marked on the plot near the corresponding points .",
    "the curve with @xmath83 corresponds to the line , on which , according to  @xcite , a self - consistent procedure can find the correct quasi - bound state position .",
    "we see , that this claim is unjustified , especially for the self - consistent values of @xmath79 found in  @xcite : @xmath84        the curves with non - zero @xmath81 show an interesting `` inverse '' behavior : with increasing @xmath85 the quasi - bound state becomes narrower .",
    "this is due to the fact , that @xmath78 enters the diagonal couplings of the chiral potential with negative sign .",
    "thus increasing of the negative @xmath81 by absolute value corresponds not to increasing of the absorption due to the open @xmath2 channel , but to its reduction .    from fig.[ekn_fixed.fig",
    "] one can also conclude , that the imaginary part of @xmath78 influences not only the width of the quasi - bound state , but its position , too .",
    "otherwise , the points on the curves , corresponding to equal @xmath79 values , should lie strictly below each other .",
    "the deviations from this pattern are apparent , especially towards the ends of trajectories .",
    "if one asks the question , whether a similar curve can be found , which contains the exact pole , the answer is `` yes '' , with @xmath86 mev , while the pole is found at @xmath87 mev .",
    "this value of @xmath78 is rather far from the `` self - consistent '' ones , eqs.([zknvaize],[zknevrei ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to find @xmath78 values , which yield the quasi - bound state positions , found in  @xcite , also shown on fig.[ekn_fixed.fig ] .",
    "these values , however , have positive imaginary parts , which is hard to interpret .",
    "it is interesting to note that for positive fixed @xmath81 above a certain ( critical ) value the trajectories have two branches , as it is seen on the example with @xmath88 mev . as a consequence , some values of @xmath78",
    "allow for two poles in the considered region of the energy plane .    in general , it looks like for any quasi - bound state location one can find a complex @xmath78 , which in a coupled - channels faddeev calculation leads to this pole position . however , even if we know , that there exists a @xmath78 giving the correct quasi - bound state pole , it is absolutely not clear , whether an operator can be defined , whose expectation value would give this @xmath78 , at least approximately .",
    "without such an operator no self - consistent scheme can be constructed to treat the energy dependence of the interaction .",
    "we calculated @xmath1 quasi - bound state positions for the two phenomenological and the chirally motivated models of the @xmath3 interaction , which all describe the available experimental @xmath5 data equally well .",
    "we found , that the quasi - bound states resulting from the phenomenological potentials lie about @xmath89 mev deeper , than those of the chirally motivated one . in our opinion , this is due to the energy dependence of the chiral interaction , leading to less attraction for lower energies .",
    "we obtained binding energy @xmath7 mev for the chirally motivated and @xmath8 mev for the phenomenological @xmath3 potentials .",
    "the width is about @xmath9 mev was obtained with the two - pole models of the interaction , while the one - pole potential gives @xmath10 mev .",
    "we discussed in some detail , how energy dependence of the two - body interaction can be accounted for in few - body calculations .",
    "it was shown , that momentum space faddeev integral equations allow an exact treatment of this energy dependence .",
    "on the contrary , coordinate space variational methods can use only energy independent interactions , therefore we performed a series of calculations with differently fixed two - particle @xmath3 energies @xmath78 in the couplings of the chirally motivated interaction .",
    "our conclusion is , that the method used in  @xcite is unable to define an `` averaged '' @xmath78 , for which the fixed - energy chirally motivated interaction , even in a correct three - body calculation , can yield a @xmath0 quasi - bound state position with any relation to the exact one .",
    "first , our calculations show , that a real @xmath78 has absolutely no chance to reproduce or reasonably approximate the exact quasi - bound state position , even with correct treatment of the imaginary part of the interaction , unlike in  @xcite .",
    "second , the way , how the `` self - consistent '' value of ( generally complex ) @xmath78 is defined in the papers does not seem to guarantee , that the correct value will be reached or at least approximated . in view of the above considerations ,",
    "the results of  @xcite can be considered as rough estimates of what a really energy dependent @xmath3 interaction will produce in the @xmath0 system .",
    "similarly , the four - body results of  @xcite would hardly survive a comparison with an exact four - body calculation , which , however , still has to be done ."
