    "in classical geometry of numbers the elements of an ordinary continued fraction for a real number @xmath0 are obtained from a _ sail _ ( i.e. a broken line bounding the convex hull of all points with integer coefficients in certain cone ) . in present paper",
    "we find broken lines generalizing sails to the case of continued fractions with arbitrary elements .",
    "this in its turn leads to the definition of `` infinitesimal '' continued fractions , whose sails would be differentiable curves .",
    "such `` infinitesimal '' continued fractions are defined by two density functions : areal and angular densities .",
    "the areal density function has a remarkable physical meaning .",
    "consider an observer at the origin and let the body move along the curve with the velocity inverse to the areal density function .",
    "then the body moves according to the second kepler law with respect to the observer , i.e. with constant sector area velocity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first section we study the classical case of ordinary continued fractions . in section  2",
    "we expand the notion of the sail to the case of continued fraction with arbitrary elements .",
    "further we show how to write continued fractions starting with broken lines .",
    "we generalize the proposed construction of sails to the case of curves , give an analog of continued fractions , and show several examples in section  3 .",
    "for a nice reference to general theory of continued fractions we suggest the book  @xcite .",
    "several works are devoted to geometry of continued fractions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and to their generalizations to multidimensional case ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc ) .",
    "notice that the case of broken lines with integer edges discussed in  @xcite is a particular subcase of geometric definitions introduced in section 2 .",
    "the author is grateful to v.  i.  arnold for constant attention to this work , and to technische universitt graz for hospitality and excellent working conditions .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce geometric aspects of ordinary continued fractions .",
    "we start with general notions of continued fractions . for arbitrary sequence of real numbers @xmath1 the _ continued fraction _ is an expression @xmath2 denoted @xmath3 $ ] . in case of a finite sequence",
    "we get some real number ( or sometimes @xmath4 ) . in case of infinite continued fraction",
    "the expression means a limit of a sequence @xmath5)$ ] while @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "notice that such limit does not exist for all sequences .",
    "a continued fraction is called _ ordinary _ if @xmath7 is integer and the rest elements are positive integers .",
    "a finite continued fraction is _ odd _ ( _ even _ ) if it contains odd ( even ) elements .",
    "a rational number has a unique odd and a unique even continued fractions .",
    "+ an irrational number has a unique infinite continued fraction .",
    "we continue with several definitions of integer geometry .",
    "a point is said to be _ integer _ if all its coefficients are integers .",
    "the _ integer length _ of a segment @xmath8 is the number of integer points inside the segment plus one , denote it by @xmath9 .",
    "integer sine _ of the angle @xmath10 is the index of the integer sublattice generated by the integer vectors of the segments @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the whole lattice , we denote in by @xmath13 . for more information on lattice ( in particularly integer )",
    "trigonometry we refer to  @xcite and to  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be a cone with vertex at the origin .",
    "take the convex hull of all integer points except the origin in @xmath14 .",
    "the boundary of the described convex hull is a broken line together with one or two rays in case if there are some integer points on the edges of the cone .",
    "the broken line in the boundary of the convex hull is called the _ sail _ of @xmath14 .",
    "( in some literature the sail is the whole boundary of the convex hull , for us it is more convenient to exclude the rays from the definition of a sail . )",
    "consider a positive real number @xmath15 .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the cone with vertex at the origin and edges @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the sail for @xmath16 is a finite broken line if @xmath15 is rational and one - side infinite broken line if @xmath15 is irrational .",
    "so let the sail be a broken line @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "denote @xmath21 for all admissible @xmath22 .",
    "the sequence @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) is called the _ lattice length - sine sequence _ for the cone @xmath16 ( or _ lls - sequence for short _ ) .    @xmath25    the connection of geometric and analytic properties of lls - sequence is introduced by the following theorem .",

    "further we use the following notation . for a couple of vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote by @xmath31 the oriented volume of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 .      in this subsection",
    "we give a natural geometric interpretation of an odd or infinite continued fraction with arbitrary elements .",
    "it would be a broken line defined by the positions of the first vertex and the selected point @xmath32 , direction of the first edge , and the continued fraction .",

    "this rational function is a ration of two polynomials with non - negative integer coefficients , denote them by @xmath73 and @xmath74 . actually the polynomials @xmath73 and @xmath75",

    "let @xmath63 and @xmath110 be two broken lines with @xmath111 , such that the vector of the first edges either have the same direction if @xmath112 or opposite otherwise .",
    "suppose the corresponding continued fractions coincide : @xmath113=[b_0 , \\ldots , b_{2m}].\\ ] ] then the points @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the origin @xmath32 are in a line .",
    "consider an @xmath69-operator taking @xmath34 to @xmath88 and @xmath50 to the line @xmath90 . by proposition  [ conjugate ] the continued fractions for both broken lines",

    "hence by corollary  [ geometry ] the points @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the origin are in a line .",
    "[ cc](_on closed curves . _ ) how to find that a certain continued fraction defines a closed curve ? from theorem  [ geometry ] we see that a broken line defined by an lls - sequence @xmath81 with @xmath56 and @xmath83 being collinear to @xmath80 is closed if and only if @xmath116 so , _ these two polynomial conditions on the elements of the lls - sequence are necessary and sufficient conditions for the broken line to be closed_.    notice that the condition @xmath117 can be rewritten in the following nice form @xmath118=0.\\ ] ] the condition @xmath117 was introduced in  @xcite for certain broken - lines with integer vertices .",

    "suppose we have a broken line and two distinct points @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "now let us study what happens if we consider a curve as a broken line with infinitesimally small segments .",
    "it turns out that the lls - sequence `` splits '' to a couple of functions which we call _ areal and angular densities_. we introduce the necessary notions and discuss basic properties of these functions .",
    "in particular we show that the areal density is inverse to a velocity of a point defined by the second kepler law .",
    "now we prove the theorem on finite reconstruction of a curve ( i.e. , in some small neighborhood ) knowing the areal density and a starting point .",
    "this is analogous to the algorithm that finds a broken line by the elements of the corresponding continued fraction described in subsection  [ algorithm ] .",
