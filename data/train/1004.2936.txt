    "the basic structure of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) is determined by the spin - down energy injected by the central pulsar and the interaction of the nebula with the interior regions of the supernova remnant ( snr ) in which it evolves .",
    "losses from synchrotron radiation in the nebular magnetic field , whose strength depends both on the nature of the injected wind and on the evolving size of the pwn , inverse - compton scattering of ambient photons by the energetic electron population within the nebula , and adiabatic expansion as the nebula sweeps up the surrounding supernova ejecta , all combine to determine emission structure and long - term evolution of the nebula .",

    "multiwavelength observations of pwne provide crucial information on the underlying particle spectrum which , in turn , strongly constrains both the magnetic field strength and the stage of evolution . of particular importance",
    "is the spectrum of particles injected into the pwn .",
    "while this is typically assumed to be a power law , it has long been known that the spectrum of the crab nebula is not fully consistent with such a structure ; changes in the spectral index in the optical band seem to indicate inherent features in the injection spectrum , and the large population of radio - emitting particles may have a completely distinct origin from that of the higher energy particles .",
    "complex structure in the observed spectrum of a pwn can originate in a number of ways that are associated with the long - term evolution , including synchrotron losses and interaction with the snr reverse shock ( reynolds & chevalier 1984 ; gelfand , slane , & zhang 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , recent studies of the spectrum immediately downstream of the wind termination shock show that , at least in some cases , the injection spectrum itself deviates significantly from a simple power law ( slane et al .",
    "2008 ) , and particle - in - cell simulations of the acceleration process produce spectra that are well - described by a maxwellian population with a power law tail ( spitkovsky 2008 ) . any such structure in the spectrum of the injected particles imprints itself on the broadband emission spectrum of the entire nebula .",
    "the resulting breaks or regions of curvature in the emission spectrum , and the frequencies at which they are observed , depend upon the energy at which features appear in the electron spectrum as well as the means by which the photons are produced ( e.g. synchrotron radiation or inverse - compton emission ) . to fully understand the nature of the particle injection , as well as the long - term evolution of pwne , it is thus crucial to study the emission structure over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "gamma - ray observations have provided an important window into the late - phase structure of pwne .",
    "while the x - ray emission from older pwne is relatively weak due to the long - term decline in magnetic field strength , inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as well as other ambient photons , by the energetic particles in the nebula produce very energetic photons , providing unique discovery space for these systems . even in younger nebulae",
    ", the @xmath1-ray emission provides a crucial probe of the particle spectrum in energy regions that are not accessible with other observations . the inverse - compton emission from photons with a characteristic temperature @xmath2 peaks at an energy @xmath3 for scattering from electrons of energy @xmath4 .",
    "cmb photons scattered into the bandpass of the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) , for example , originate from interactions with electrons in the approximate energy range 0.25  4 tev .",
    "such particles produce synchrotron radiation with photon energies in the range @xmath5  ev , where @xmath6 is the magnetic field strength in units of 10@xmath7 g .",
    "depending on the magnetic field , which can range from @xmath8 g or higher for young pwne , down to @xmath9 g for highly evolved systems , the synchrotron emission from particles in this energy range can be difficult to detect due to instrumentation limitations ( at long radio wavelengths ) , absorption ( in the optical / uv range ) or confusion with the bright sky galactic background ( in the infrared ) .",

    "this corresponds to an energy flux ( above 100  mev ) of @xmath55 . for the spin - down power suggested by its x - ray luminosity ,",
    "the available energy flux from the pulsar that powers hess j1640@xmath0465  is @xmath56 .",
    "thus , as much as 10% of its spin - down could conceivably be contributing directly to @xmath1-rays in the lat band .",
    "there are known radio pulsars within the field of 1fgl  j1640.8@xmath04634 as well .",
    "psr  j1637@xmath04642 , for example , is located within @xmath57  arcmin and has a total energy flux of @xmath58 given its estimated distance and measured spin - down .",
    "thus , while our spectral fits do not require a pulsar - like component , it it quite feasible that one or more of these sources contributes as much as 20% of the observed flux .",
    "inspection of figure 5 makes it clear , however , that the remaining lat emission still vastly exceeds the predicted flux from hess j1640@xmath0465 .",
    "we note that simple power - law injection models for vela x , another evolved pwn , fail to reproduce the observed broadband spectrum ( lamassa , slane , & de jager 2009 ) .",
    "the presence of an excess population of low - energy electrons has been suggested , and models for the inverse - compton scattering of photons from this population predict an excess of @xmath1-rays in the gev range ( de jager , slane , & lamassa 2009 ) . this excess has been confirmed with observations by both agile ( pellizzoni et al .",
    "2010 ) and _ fermi_(abdo et al .",
    "motivated by this result , we modified the evolved power law spectrum from our model for hess j1640@xmath0465  by truncating the lower end of the power law and adding a distinct low - energy component .",
    "based on results from simulations of shock acceleration ( spitkovsky 2008 ) , we chose a maxwellian distribution for this population .",
    "our resulting ( ad hoc ) particle spectrum is shown in the upper panel in figure 5 , and the resulting broadband emission is shown in the magenta curves in the lower panel . here",
    "we have adjusted the normalization of the maxwellian to reproduce the emission in the _",
    "fermi_-lat band , which is produced primarily by upscattered infrared ( ir ) photons from local dust .",
    "the energy density and mean temperature of the ir photon field was adjusted slightly to improve the agreement between the data and the model , but the values ( listed in the caption ) are within reasonable expectations ( see , e.g. , strong et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we find a mean value of @xmath59 for the electrons in the maxwellian component , and roughly 5% of the total electron energy in the power law tail , consistent with results from particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "the associated pair multiplicity relative to the integrated goldreich - julian injection rate is of order @xmath60 , similar to that inferred for the crab nebula as well as several other pwne ( see bucciantini et al .",
    "recent work by fang & zhang ( 2010 ) uses a similar input distribution to successfully model the emission for several pwne including hess j1640@xmath0465 .",
    "however , their results for hess j1640@xmath0465  underpredict the observed gev emission from this source , apparently due to use of a slightly lower bulk lorentz factor and a larger fraction of the total energy in the power law tail than we have used in this analysis .",
    "we note that the maxwellian shape for the low - energy electron population is not unique .",
    "indeed even a very narrow gaussian distribution can produce the gev @xmath1-ray emission without exceeding the radio upper limit for the synchrotron emission .",
    "for any of these models , the total energy in electrons requires a larger initial spin - down period than assumed for the simple power - law injection models  by a factor of roughly 3 for the adopted maxwellian distribution .",
    "this is within the uncertainty in our assumed value based on scaling from the x - ray luminosity of the pwn .",
    "it is also important to note that while our proposed model is consistent with the observed properties of this system , there are potential degeneracies in the effects of different model parameters , meaning that the proposed scenario is not necessarily unique .",
    "an alternative scenario for the @xmath1-ray emission is that it arises from the snr itself , and not the pwn .",
    "nonthermal bremsstrahlung has been suggested as a mechanism for the production of @xmath1-rays in snrs ( e.g. bykov et al",
    "this process can be dominant for electron - to - proton ratios of order 1 .",
    "however , the value typical of local cosmic rays is closer to @xmath61 , and even smaller values appear favored in models for @xmath1-ray emission from snrs ( e.g. morlino et al .",
    "2009 , zirakashvili & aharonian 2010 , ellison et al .",
    "2010 ) , so that this process is typically not dominant .",
    "the dashed blue curve in figure 5 represents a model for the emission from the collision of protons accelerated in the snr with ambient material , leading to @xmath1-rays from the production and subsequent decay of neutral pions .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum is calculated based on kamae et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using a scaling factor of 1.85 for helium and heavy nuclei ( mori 2009 ) , and we have used a power law distribution of protons with @xmath62 to best reproduce the observed spectrum . assuming a shock compression ratio of 4 and that 25% of the total supernova energy appears in the form of relativistic protons , an ambient density @xmath63 is required to produce the model shown in figure 5 .",
    "this is much higher than can be accommodated for the observed size of the snr and the lack of observed thermal x - ray emission from the snr .",
    "such high densities are found in dense molecular clouds , suggesting that the @xmath1-rays could be produced by particles that stream away to interact with high - density material outside the snr .",
    "however , only the most energetic particles can escape the acceleration region , which is in conflict with the proton spectrum we require to match the data .",
    "moreover , the observed tev emission appears to originate from within the snr boundaries , making such an escaping - particle scenario appear problematic . based on this , along with the lack of a spectral cutoff that might suggest emission from a central pulsar ,",
    "we conclude that the gev @xmath1-ray emission most likely arises from the pwn .",
    "it is well - known that a distinct low - energy electron population resides in the crab nebula , although the origin is not well - understood .",
    "atoyan ( 1999 ) has suggested that the spin - down timescale @xmath47 ( see equation 1 ) may itself be time - dependent , resulting in a large energy input in the earliest epoch of pulsar spin - down , when significant synchrotron and adiabatic losses would result in rapid cooling of the electrons .",
    "studies of the broadband emission from 3c  58 indicate an injection spectrum that differs from a pure power law as well ( slane et al .",
    "as noted above , observations of vela  x appear to require an excess of low - energy electrons which may be a relic population or could have been produced through rapid synchrotron losses associated with the increased magnetic field strength during the reverse - shock crushing stage .",
    "more complete modeling of the broadband emission of hess j1640@xmath0465 , accounting for the full dynamical evolution of the system , including the effects of the reverse shock on the pwn , is required to assess the overall energetics and underlying particle spectrum more completely , but is beyond the scope of the results we report here .",
    "broadband studies of hess j1640@xmath0465  have identified this source as a likely pwn , with x - ray observations providing images of an extended nebula as well as the putative pulsar powering the system .",
    "modeling of the pwn evolution based on inferred parameters of the pulsar imply detectable emission in the gev @xmath1-ray band , and our investigations of the _",
    "fermi_-lat observations of this region reveal clear evidence of such emission , consistent with the source 1fgl  j1640.8@xmath04634 . the flux and spectrum we derive are consistent with that of the previously - identified source 3eg  j1639@xmath04702 , and the much - improved position makes it likely that the emission arises from hess j1640@xmath0465 .",
    "the lack of a spectral cutoff rules out an association with emission directly from the pulsar that powers the nebula , and the flux is inconsistent with @xmath1-rays from g338.3@xmath00.0 , in which hess j1640@xmath0465   resides .",
    "we have investigated the radio , x - ray , and @xmath1-ray emission from hess j1640@xmath0465  in the context of a simple one - zone model in which power is injected into a nebula at a time - dependent rate consistent with the current observed x - ray emission from the system .",
    "we find that models constrained by the observed size of the associated snr , as well as limits on the size of the pwn , require an approximate age of 10  kyr and a current magnetic field strength of only @xmath64 g , consistent with expectations for the late - phase evolution of a pwn .",
    "the conditions in such an evolved pwn yield a considerably higher @xmath1-ray flux , relative to the x - ray flux , than in younger systems where the higher magnetic field results in significant synchrotron radiation .    the observed _",
    "fermi_-lat emission from hess j1640@xmath0465  significantly exceeds that predicted by our broadband models .",
    "we propose that the excess emission is a signature of a distinct population of low - energy electrons similar to that inferred from studies of the crab nebula and vela  x , although the nature of this electron component is not well constrained .",
    "deeper radio observations are needed to place stronger constraints on this population .",
    "sensitive searches for pulsations from the central pulsar are of particular importance to constrain the spin - down properties of the system , which can only be very roughly constrained at present .",
    "there has been considerable success in identifying such pulsars with the _ fermi_-lat , but the lack of an obvious pulsar - like spectrum in hess j1640@xmath0465  may argue for more likely success with deep radio timing searches .",
