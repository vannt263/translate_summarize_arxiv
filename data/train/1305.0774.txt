    "the experiments with heavy - ion collisions of ultra - relativistic energies probe not only matter in extreme temperatures and densities , but also under action of extremely strong electro - magnetic fields with magnitude of the hadronic scale , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is a key ingredient for many observables related to local parity and charge parity violation  @xcite",
    ". the lifetime of the magnetic field , which is needed to describe the observed data of the elliptic flow dependence for positive and negative charged particles on the asymmetry , within the framework of the chiral magnetic wave must be as large as 4 fm/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , the photon azimuthal anisotropy measured at the top rhic energy can be described by the magnetic field at a time scale of a few @xmath2 fm/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this apparent discrepancy demands theoretical studies of the time dependence of the magnetic field . in this short article",
    "we will consider effects of finite conductivity on the lifetime .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of the magnetic field on the collision energy and draw some conclusion on photon azimuthal anisotropy for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the maxwell equation describing the time evolution of the electromagnetic field in a collision reads @xmath3 where the electromagnetic current can be decomposed in two pieces : @xmath4 the internal current , @xmath5 , and the external one of the colliding nuclei , @xmath6 .",
    "the latter we will treat in the eikonal approximation neglecting effects of the proton deceleration and/or stopping . for later convenience let us separate the electromagnetic field also in the `` external '' and `` internal '' , e.g. @xmath7 where the external electromagnetic field satisfies the equations @xmath8 while for the internal we get @xmath9 this representation is especially convenient for finding a numerical solution due to the following two reasons .",
    "first , there is no need in solving the first couple of equations for the external components with the singular source terms , since the solution can be obtained by boosting the electric field of both nucleus .",
    "second , the singularities of the sources are spread by the fields , which leads to a better convergence of a numerical scheme .    in the matter rest frame",
    ", the internal current may include the contribution from the ohmic conductivity @xmath10 and the one induced by the qed anomaly @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the axial chemical potential , that can be created by a sphaleron transition in a collision .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is quite uncertain , so is @xmath15 .",
    "the electric conductivity @xmath16 was calculated using a first principal lattice qcd approach in the _ quenched _ approximation .",
    "it has been found  @xcite that above the transition temperature @xmath17 : @xmath18 the quenched approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite does not allow to draw a final concussion on the magnitude of the conductivity .",
    "we , however , do not expect that taking into account the quark loops will modify the results larger then by a factor of 2 .",
    "we also assume that charged matter , if created at early times , does not develop large collective velocity @xmath19 , which allows us to neglect the contribution @xmath20 when transforming to the laboratory rest frame .",
    "both conductivity @xmath16 and @xmath21 may result in a substantial increase of the lifetime of the magnetic field . in what follows we consider both cases separately .",
    "_ magneto - hydro scenario _ , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the characteristic timescales . for this case ,",
    "the maxwell equations can be written as @xmath25 for late times the external contribution , the last term , is not important and can be skipped . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "can be neglected for @xmath23 yielding a diffusion equation for the components of the internal magnetic field .",
    "the diffusion equation leads to a significant increase of the lifetime of the magnetic field , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite recently .",
    "however , this result was obtained under the assumption of @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic time scale is defined by the external magnetic field and proportional to the sickness of the nucleus in the beam direction , i.e. @xmath26 . for the top rhic energy , @xmath27 fm @xmath28 mev@xmath29 .",
    "the condition @xmath30 mev , therefore can be rewritten as a condition on the temperature of the created plasma , @xmath31 , which is unrealistic for collisions of such energy .",
    "thus we conclude that for realistic values of the parameters the condition @xmath23 is never satisfied . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate our numerical results for realistic values of @xmath16 , illustrating the same fact .    .",
    "]    _ formation of knots _ , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this case , neglecting second derivatives with respect to time we get @xmath34 as in previous case , for late times , the external contribution can be neglected resulting in @xmath35 the total magnetic helicity @xmath36 is conserved for the closed systems . for two fluxes of the magnetic field @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the helicity can be related to the linking number @xmath39 . substituting eq .   to eq .   and performing trivial transformations we obtain for the helicity @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total magnetic energy .",
    "this shows that conservation of the helicity leads to the conservation of the total magnetic energy for the processes with the timescales , @xmath42 . the volume @xmath43 in eq .",
    "is defined by the region of space , where @xmath44 .",
    "owing to the expansion of the medium this volume grows in time roughly as @xmath45 for late times , as @xmath46 for early times .",
    "therefore we expect the magnetic field to decay according to the power law @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "this is somewhat slower then the decay of the field induced by the spectators @xmath49 .",
    "this conclusion , however , does not take into account the formation of non - trivial topological objects , knots of the magnetic field with non - trivial linking number . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the higher the linking number corresponds to longer lifetime of the magnetic field up to @xmath50 .",
    "returning to the constraint @xmath32 , we can roughly estimate if this is satisfied in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the chiral conductivity is defined by chiral chemical potential following  @xcite @xmath51 to make an optimistic estimate we will consider quite high values of @xmath52 gev .",
    "nevertheless even in this case the numerical value for @xmath15 is only @xmath53 mev , while the inverse characteristic time for a collision of the top rhic energy is @xmath54 mev .",
    "this again shows that the effects of finite @xmath15 will not be important for the top rhic and lhc energies .",
    "numerical results to be presented in this section are obtained with the yee algorithm  @xcite , which is numerically stable for the conductivity ranging from 0 to @xmath55 .",
    "the calculations proceed as follows .",
    "first , we initialize the distribution of protons both in projectile and target according to the woods - saxon distribution with the standard parameters  @xcite .",
    "we also checked that up to statistical fluctuations the results obtained using the wood - saxon distribution coincide with those in approximation of collision of homogeneously charged spheres , which will be used for the sake of illustration in fig .",
    "next we assume that both target and projectile move with the opposite velocities of the same magnitude @xmath56 . the conducting medium in the collision is not formed immediately , because the quarks need time to be created from the glasma field .",
    "nonetheless , to make our estimates of the conductivity effects as optimistic as possible we will consider that the conducting medium is formed immediately after the collision and does not alter during the evolution .",
    "we also neglect possible non - equilibrium effects and finite time response of the medium to the electric field , which as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite may play an important role .    the decay of the conductivity owing to expansion of the medium can only decrease the lifetime of the magnetic field and thus will not be considered here .",
    "our simulations are done for au - au collisions at energy @xmath57 gev and fixed impact parameter @xmath58 fm . in fig .",
    "1 we show time evolution of the magnetic field in the origin @xmath59 as a function of the electric conductivity @xmath16 .",
    "the results show that the lifetime of the strong magnetic field ( @xmath60 ) is not affected by the conductivity , if one uses realistic values obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we established that for realistic values of the conductivities the electromagnetic fields in heavy - ion collisions are almost unmodified by the presence of the medium .",
    "thus one can safely use the magnetic field generated by the original protons only .",
    "this magnetic field can be approximated as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of protons , @xmath63 is the radius of the nuclei , @xmath64 is the lorentz factor and , finally , @xmath1 is some non - important numerical coefficient .",
    "we are interested on the effect of the magnetic field on the matter .",
    "thus we need to compute the magnetic field at the time @xmath65 , characterising matter formation time . on the basis of a very general argument",
    ", one would expect that @xmath66 .",
    "the phenomenological constraints from photon azimuthal anisotropy at the top rhic energy demand @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 . using this relation",
    ", we can estimate the magnitude of the magnetic field at the lhc energies at the time @xmath69 .",
    "for the lhc , since @xmath70 we have @xmath71 using @xmath72 , we get @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the magnetic field is not suppressed strongly at matter formation time at lhc .",
    "however , the anisotropy of photon production from magnetic field is suppressed .",
    "this follows from the following dimensional argument .",
    "first of all , to couple gluons to photons we are considering the box diagram showed in fig .  [ fig_box ] ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . integrating quark fields",
    ", we obtain an effective coupling @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and similar for @xmath76 . at early times , according to saturation picture the contribution , @xmath77 is of the order 1 in powers of @xmath78 .",
    "one of the factors of @xmath79 is associated with external coherent magnetic field , thus it compensates one power of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the diagram is of the order @xmath81 , i.e. of the same as coulomb or compton contributions to photon production .",
    "the prefactor @xmath82 is defined by the momentum running in the loop . in the first approximation it is proportional to @xmath83 and canceled out by the gluon @xmath76 . finally , parametrically we have that the amplitude of photon production is @xmath84 ( we consider only central rapidity region , @xmath85 ) .",
    "the rate of photon production is thus @xmath86 .",
    "thus the photon @xmath87 generated at early stage is thus , @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath89 calculated at given @xmath90 is small owing to the prefactor @xmath91 .",
    "in this article , we calculated the time dependence of the magnetic field on time allowing for conductivity effects in the plasma .",
    "in contrast to the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that the effects of conductivity do not play an important role for realistic values .",
    "we also have argued that while photon flow may receive reasonable size effects from production in an external magnetic field at rhic energies , the induced flow is very small at lhc energies .",
    "this can also be tested experimentally with the method proposed in ref .",
