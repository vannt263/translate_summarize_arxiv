    "the watson - crick double - helical form of dna @xcite is not a static structure : even at standard salt conditions and room temperature the base pairs may intermittently open up and expose the otherwise protected core of the nucleotides .",
    "such local denaturation bubbles are usually quite short - lived , however , the propensity of double - stranded dna towards formation of longer - lived bubbles can be increased by elevating temperature or lowering the salt concentration .",
    "@xcite in naturally underwound circular dna denaturation bubbles are stabilized by partial twist release , @xcite while in modern single dna molecule setups bubble formation may be facilitated by the exertion of longitudinal stretching forces . @xcite the preferred location of bubbles is connected with the stability landscape of the genome , as quantified by maps of stability parameters , which are functions of the specific , underlying sequence of gc and at base pairs .",
    "@xcite in a biological context , bubbles correspond to so - called dna unwinding elements ( due ) , which are central in processes such as gene regulation , dna replication , and transcription .",
    "@xcite similarly , in higher organisms the thermodynamic stability landscape of dna is related to the coding versus non - coding properties of the genome .",
    "@xcite the denaturation of a long dna chain from double - strand to two separate single - strands is a physical phase transition , whose order is determined by the magnitude of the critical exponent @xmath0 for the entropy loss of a flexible polymer loop , see the discussion below .",
    "@xcite the opening - closing dynamics of denaturation bubbles can be quantified by simple nonequilibrium models based on the gradient of the dna stability free energy landscape .",
    "@xcite    melting profiles of dna can be obtained from a host of experimental techniques .",
    "these include uv spectroscopic methods , @xcite circular dichroism , @xcite fluorescence resonant energy transfer measurements , @xcite calorimetry , @xcite or nuclear magnetic resonance , @xcite among others .",
    "single dna manipulation techniques such as unzipping have recently been shown to provide high accuracy results for the stability parameters and their salt dependence .",
    "@xcite from the respective melting or unzipping curves the dna stability parameters are deduced , which in bioinformatics serve to predict the melting profiles of arbitrary , given dna sequences .",
    "@xcite up until now the different sets of stability parameters differ considerably from each other .",
    "@xcite alternative methods to measure these may help to pin down optimized parameters .",
    "one way could be to use dynamic information from bubble breathing .",
    "indeed , by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy the breathing dynamics of single dna bubbles has been monitored , producing the breathing - induced fluorescence - fluorescence correlation function , that is pronouncedly non - exponential .",
    "@xcite given the recent progress in experimental methods , we expect that time series of single bubble dynamics will soon become available , in which opening or closing events of individual base pairs can be monitored .",
    "a high potential for such time records lies in nano - channel approaches as the one reported in ref .  , after new labeling techniques will become available shortly .    in what follows we",
    "pursue the question whether the bubble size distribution obtained from single breathing time series may , in principle , be used to obtain reliable information on the dna stability parameters .",
    "we show that indeed by stochastic analysis methods such as simulated annealing ( sa ) accurate estimates for the stability parameters may be obtained for known dna sequences .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first introduce the general statistical model of dna base pairing , before proceeding to present the methodology of sa . in the subsequent section we present our results , before drawing our conclusions .",
    "the size of denaturation bubbles typically ranges from a few broken base pairs ( bps ) at physiological temperature in linear , unconstrained dna , to some 200 broken bps closer to the melting temperature of the dna .",
    "@xcite bubbles of some hundred broken base pairs also occur in naturally underwound dna .",
    "@xcite following the notation of ref .",
    ", the stability of dna is characterized by the free energies @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the watson - crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides ( a and t , g and c , respectively ) as well as the independent stacking free energies @xmath3 for disrupting the stacking interactions between nearest neighbor bps .",
    "these stacking energies depend on the nature of the two vicinal bps , as well as on their orientation along the dna molecule ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) .",
    "the free energies are functions of temperature and salt concentration . depending on the used set of stability parameters more or less pronounced asymmetries in the stacking free energies",
    "are observed .",
    "@xcite in addition to the hydrogen bonding and stacking free energies , there is an additional energetic cost for initiating a bubble in the first place .",
    "roughly speaking , this term originates from the fact that two stacking contacts need to be broken , while only one single broken bp yields an entropic gain .",
    "this is either taken into consideration by the cooperativity factor @xmath6 , or the so - called ring factor @xmath7 , see below .",
    "@xcite    the l33b9 sequence @xcite we are analyzing in the present work is given as follows , @xmath8 where the double - strand is completed by adding the complementary single strand .",
    "the sequence ( [ seq ] ) is linear , and the high content of more stable gc bps at the two ends ensures that these ends preferentially remain closed . a denaturation bubble forms in the center of the chain that is rich in weaker at bonds .",
    "we therefore view the two extremities denoted by the lower case symbol ` c ` as completely clamped . labeling the sequence of bps by the coordinate @xmath9 ,",
    "ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , we thus have @xmath12 internal bps , which are allowed to open up , while the bps at @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain closed by definition . in a mathematical sense ,",
    "the bps at the two extremities represent reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , we call @xmath13 and @xmath14 the momentary positions of the two closed bps embracing the denaturation bubble to the left and right , such that the bubble size becomes @xmath15 . in terms of the boltzmann factors for hydrogen bonding of the bp at position @xmath9 , @xmath16 and the stacking interactions between the bps at positions @xmath17 and @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath18 the bubble partition function becomes ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 at @xmath21 , we take @xmath22 . in eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) , the factor @xmath23 takes care of the entropy loss upon formation of a closed polymer loop . for a self - avoiding chain in three dimensions",
    ", the critical exponent becomes @xmath24 .@xcite corrections of @xmath0 may occur due to interactions with the rest of the chain , @xcite however , for the short dna construct used here , such effects are not expected to be relevant . the ring factor is @xmath25 , @xcite and we define @xmath26 .",
    "the ring factor may be interpreted as the cooperativity parameter , divided by the boltzmann factor for stacking , @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite in principle , the ring factor depends on the position .",
    "however , a bubble will statistically always form at the weakest link . considering this",
    "we have used a constant value of ring factor , @xmath7 in the present work . with above notation",
    ", the equilibrium distribution for finding a bubble of size @xmath28 and with the leftmost broken bp located at position @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30      powered by thermal fluctuations , the bubble size becomes a random process as a function of time .",
    "varying stepwise by further unzipping of one bp at position @xmath13 or @xmath14 , or by zipping at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the bubble size @xmath28 performs a random walk along the coordinate @xmath9 , the bubble breathing dynamics .",
    "@xcite this process is described by the master equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability distribution for finding a bubble of size @xmath28 with the leftmost open bp at position @xmath31 , at time @xmath35 .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 contains the transfer rates for all possible transitions in the @xmath37 space , for details see ref .  .",
    "in the long time limit , the solution @xmath38 of the master equation ( [ meq ] ) equilibrates to the distribution @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ eqd ] ) . to generate individual bubble breathing time series for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as well as construct the distribution @xmath42",
    ", one may employ the gillespie algorithm .",
    "@xcite    following the experimental setup in ref .",
    ", one may study the dynamics of a _ tagged _ bp located at @xmath43 . in the typical experimental scenario fluorescence occurs if the bps in a @xmath44-neighborhood of the fluorophore position @xmath45 are open .",
    "measured fluorescence time series thus correspond to the stochastic variable @xmath46 , with the properties @xmath47 if at least all bps in @xmath48 are open , and @xmath49 otherwise .",
    "@xcite in what follows we probe whether a single bp is open or closed , i.e. , we choose @xmath50 .    [ profile ]",
    "open ( solid line ) , compared with the result from the converged sa scheme ( blue open squares ) .",
    "the underlying dna sequence is given in eq .",
    "( [ seq]).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "given the probability distribution @xmath51 , constructed from an experimental or simulations time series @xmath40 , @xmath41 , for a bubble in the dna construct under consideration : can we reliably extract the stability parameters ? here",
    "we show that stochastic optimization is the method of choice .",
    "finding system parameters in a complex landscape is a generic task across disciplines .",
    "@xcite typically , a given problem is cast in such a manner that the seeked - for optimum corresponds to an extremum of a functional in the complex search space .",
    "for instance , to obtain the global minimum in a rugged potential energy surface , one starts from any arbitrary point on this landscape and then moves on in the search space , following certain rules , such as accepting a move if the gradient norm for the new position decreases .",
    "this process converges to a point for which the gradient norm is zero . to verify whether this point is a minimum",
    ", one needs to check if the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix at that point are all positive . a completely deterministic optimization procedure such as this minimization of the gradient norm , however ,",
    "will generally fail to determine the global minimum if the search space features multiple minima .",
    "once a local minimum is found , the deterministic search method will simply terminate .",
    "such a misguidance is avoided by true global optimizers , whose search is not solely driven by a gradient .",
    "in particular , stochastic optimization techniques turn out to be very successful . originally proposed by kirkpatrick and coworkers to solve the traveling salesman problem",
    ", @xcite sa represents such a true global optimizer , and has been applied to a broad range of problems across disciplines , see , for instance , refs .  .",
    "in sa , the search space is initially sampled at a high temperature ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the associated thermal fluctuations at a suitable value of @xmath52 will lift the optimizer out of local minima such that the search may continue towards increasingly deeper minima . once the temperature becomes sufficiently small and/or the search is carried out over a sufficient time span , the entire search space is probed . due to this ergodic property the global minimum",
    "is indeed found unequivocally .",
    "@xcite    typically , an sa analysis is started at a sufficiently high temperature .",
    "this makes nearly all moves acceptable , as the criterion for accepting or rejecting a move is determined by the metropolis criterion . in our case , the associated cost function , which is being minimized , is the sum of the squares of the difference of the occupation probabilities at the various positions , @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the distribution at position @xmath9 found in the current sa step , when the simulation temperature is @xmath52 . if , on going from one sa step ( @xmath55 ) to the next ( @xmath56 ) the magnitude of the cost function decreases , we at once accept that move .",
    "if it increases , we do not discard the move rightout .",
    "instead , we subject it to the metropolis test @xcite : if the quantity @xmath57 has a positive value , the probability for accepting the move is determined by the function @xmath58 for positive @xmath59 , @xmath60 is always between 0 and 1 . for each evaluation of @xmath60",
    ", we invoke a random number @xmath61 between 0 and 1 .",
    "if @xmath62 , we accept the move . if not , the move is rejected",
    "thus , at very high @xmath52 , @xmath60 will be close to 1 and most moves will be accepted , such that a greater region of the search space will be sampled . as the simulation proceeds , @xmath52 is decreased by the _",
    "annealing schedule_. once the correct path towards the global minimum is followed , we need not search the entire space and concentrate on a small region , which will guide us specifically to the global minimum .",
    "that is , as @xmath52 is lowered , a decreasing number of moves pass the metropolis test .",
    "ultimately , in our problem we recover the stability parameters from the sa analysis .    in sa , the crucial factor which determines the success of optimization is the annealing schedule , which is basically the rate at which the simulation temperature is decreased in successive annealing steps . in the present study",
    "we have kept the initial temperature at 1000 .",
    "the rate of cooling was kept at @xmath63 of the value of the present step .",
    "we have also ensured that after every 30 sa steps , the system is re - heated to the initial starting value , i.e. , the simulation temperature is forcibly increased to a higher value .",
    "this is done to remove any possibility of being trapped in a local minimum ( coming out of which will be difficult if the simulation temperature is low ) . in successive sa steps , along with the temperature ,",
    "the individual stability parameters are changed by the following strategy .",
    "if @xmath64 is a parameter chosen for change in sa , it is updated by the rule : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a random integer , @xmath44 is the amplitude of allowed change ( kept at @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 is a random number between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the new @xmath71 ( changed stability parameter ) is used to generate the updated distribution profile .",
    "the magnitudes of the different optimization parameters are collected in table  [ mag ] .    ) and are thus not subject to the sa optimization criteria , i.e. , they do not converge . ]",
    ".magnitude of optimization parameters used in sa . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab ]",
    "generalising our previous approach , @xcite we here demonstrate the outstanding ability of stochastic optimization to determine the stability parameters of double - stranded dna from time series of the breathing dynamics of individual bps . even for a short dna sequence such as l33b9 [ eq .",
    "( [ seq ] ) ] with only 31 internal bps , the convergence of the chosen sa scheme to all present base stacking and hydrogen bonding free energies is recovered with appreciable accuracy .",
    "even when the input data are perturbed randomly , mimicking noisy experimental or simulations data , the stochastic optimization technique works successfully .",
    "optimization based on the bubble distribution @xmath72 is not the only way to extract the dna stability parameters .",
    "for instance , one might use average values for the zipping and unzipping rates of individual bps and relate their ratio to the underlying free energy difference .",
    "alternatively , once from high throughput fluorescence correlation experiments an accurate result for the fluorescence autocorrelation function becomes available , one might use this function as basis for the optimization . in principle , one might also modify our approach to analyse data from dna unzipping .",
    "this , however , requires detailed knowledge on the change of the stacking and hydrogen free energies upon stretching of the dna strands .    in general",
    ", it may be worthwhile to also explore the possibility to apply other techniques such as the genetic algorithm , @xcite parallel tempering , @xcite or ant colony optimization , @xcite and to compare these methods .",
