    "in the fabrication of ferromagnetic semiconductors for spintronics applications a lot of research focuses on the homogeneous doping of traditional or oxide semiconductors with @xmath7 ions  @xcite . however , the coupling between magnetic impurities and charge carriers is often too weak , leading to curie temperatures ( @xmath8 ) way below room temperature ( rt ) . on the other hand , materials like fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 exhibit intrinsic semiconducting and ferrimagnetic properties , although the end members @xmath11-fe@xmath1o@xmath2  and fetio@xmath2  are antiferromagnetic insulators with @xmath12 and 56  k , respectively . besides applications in spintronics ,",
    "this material is also discussed in paleomagnetism as a possible cause of anomalies in the earth s magnetic field , as well as for electronics devices ( _ e.g. _  varistors ) because it is a wide band gap semiconductor that can be either @xmath13- or @xmath14-type depending on the doping concentration  @xcite .",
    "a curie temperature above rt and a reduction of resistivity was observed in synthetic solid solutions with ti concentrations up to 70%  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 was found to increase upon annealing both in these samples and in thin epitaxial films  @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to cation ordering phenomena related to a miscibility gap in the rather complex phase diagram of the system  @xcite .",
    "the origin of ferrimagnetic behavior remained unclear until recently . both materials have a corundum(-related ) structure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : struct ] ) with a stacking of 2fe@xmath4/3o@xmath15  in hematite ( space group @xmath16 ) and 2fe@xmath3/3o@xmath15/2ti@xmath17/3o@xmath15  in ilmenite ( @xmath18 ) along the [ 0001]-direction .",
    "thus at an interface or in a solid solution ( ss ) charge is not compensated , if all ions preserved their bulk valence states .",
    "dft calculations considering correlation effects within lda+u  @xcite showed that the charge mismatch is accommodated by a mixed fe@xmath4 , fe@xmath3  contact layer at the interface  @xcite , providing first theoretical evidence for the _ lamellar magnetism hypothesis _",
    "the fe@xmath3-ions at the interface give rise to uncompensated moments and also to impurity states in the band gap .",
    "the incorporation of ti in hematite  @xcite ( @xmath19  , @xmath20  ) introduces a substantial strain : the volume of the end member ilmenite  @xcite ( @xmath21  , @xmath22  ) is 9.7% larger than the one of hematite .",
    "indeed , lens - shaped dark contrasts around nanoscale hematite lamellae in an ilmenite host , imaged by transmission electron microscopy , indicate significant strain fields  @xcite .",
    "epitaxial fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 films  @xcite are typically grown on an al@xmath5o@xmath6(0001)-substrate ( @xmath23   , @xmath24   ) which introduces a substantial compressive strain of 5.8% and 8.8% compared to fe@xmath1o@xmath2  and fetio@xmath2  and only rarely , a cr@xmath1o@xmath2-buffer layer is used  @xcite to reduce the lattice mismatch .",
    "epitaxial strain can have a strong impact on the film properties , _",
    "e.g. _  by tuning the magnetic interactions in magnetoelastic composites  @xcite , enhancing ferroelectricity  @xcite or even inducing orbital reconstructions  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present study is to explore the effect of strain on the properties of fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 .",
    "in particular we address its influence on @xmath25 the energetic stability and compensation mechanism as well as on @xmath26 the electronic , magnetic and structural properties of the system .",
    "dft calculations are performed on ss and layered configurations with @xmath27 and 0.66 , strained laterally at the lattice parameters of al@xmath5o@xmath6 , fe@xmath5o@xmath6 , and fetio@xmath6 .",
    "we use the all - electron full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code  @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite . within lda+u  @xcite @xmath28  ev and @xmath29  ev",
    "is applied to the fe and ti @xmath7 states .",
    "these values were found to reproduce correctly the ground state of fetio@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the systems are simulated in a hexagonal unit cell with 60 atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) . besides the layered configurations ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]a ) more homogeneous distributions are generated by substituting @xmath30 of fe in a bilayer by ti , as shown _ e.g. _  in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]b - c . for",
    "further details on the calculation see ( ref .",
    "the optimized @xmath31-ratio and volume ( fig .",
    "[ c - vers - x]a - b ) show a linear increase with @xmath32 in accordance with vegard s law , similar to what was observed experimentally in synthetic hematite - ilmenite solid solutions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a given concentration both @xmath31 and @xmath33 are largely independent of the distribution of ti - impurities .",
    "the @xmath31-ratio of bulk fetio@xmath2  ( 2.76 ) is slightly larger than the one for @xmath11-fe@xmath1o@xmath2  and al@xmath1o@xmath2  ( 2.73 ) . due to the small tensile / compressive strain when using a@xmath34/a@xmath35  the @xmath31-ratio of fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2",
    "is slightly reduced ( -1.1 to -2.8 % ) /increased ( 3.1 - 5.2 % ) , respectively .",
    "in contrast , due to the high compressive strain on an al@xmath1o@xmath2-substrate , @xmath31 increases strongly by 14.7 - 16.6 % which corresponds to @xmath36   .",
    "nevertheless , the volume does not completely relax : the volume of the system strained at the al@xmath1o@xmath2-lateral lattice constant is 6.8 % ( 10.2 % ) smaller than when strained at a@xmath35  ( a@xmath34 ) .",
    "the volumes of fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 strained at a@xmath34  and a@xmath35  lie between the ones for the end members fe@xmath1o@xmath2  and fetio@xmath2 .",
    "x - ray diffraction data for fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 films on al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 )  @xcite indicate significant lateral strain relaxation : already in a 10  nm thick film @xmath37 relaxes to the bulk value of fetio@xmath2  with only a small change in @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ c - vers - x]a ) . the @xmath31 values and volumes obtained by takada  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite are in good agreement with the dft values of the systems strained at a@xmath34 .",
    "next we turn to the influence of strain on the energetic stability . the formation energy with respect to the end members as a function of @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "[ c - vers - x]c for the three different substrate lattice constants . for each ti - concentration",
    "we have considered several different cation arrangements , _",
    "e.g. _  for @xmath39",
    "these include an ordered arrangement with an fe layer sandwiched between two ti layers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]a ) or solid solutions with ti ions either in the same ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]b ) or different spin - sublattices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]c ) .",
    "we find that compensation through ti@xmath17  and disproportionation in fe@xmath3 , fe@xmath4  is more favorable over mechanisms involving ti@xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the formation energy increases linearly with @xmath32 .",
    "these features are independent of the substrate lattice parameters .",
    "systems strained laterally at a@xmath34  are more stable than the ones on a@xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the formation energy of films strained at a@xmath40  increases by 0.7  ev as compared to films on a@xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the strong compressive strain is energetically unfavorable and gives a possible explanation why a lateral strain relaxation occurs in fe@xmath9ti@xmath10o@xmath2 films  @xcite . while for systems strained on hematite and ilmenite substrates layered arrangements ( full symbols ) are more favorable than homogeneous distributions ( open symbols ) , the trend is reversed for @xmath39 and @xmath41 on an al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001)-substrate .    concerning the electronic properties of the hemo - ilmenite system , we have plotted in fig .  [ dos ] the density of states of a ti - double layer in a hematite host ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]a ) , but similar behavior is observed for all studied systems . upon ti@xmath17",
    "substitution , an iron - ion from the neighboring layer turns fe@xmath3 , as observed also for isolated impurities by velev  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the fe@xmath3o@xmath42 and the tio@xmath42-octahedron are corner- ( and not face-)sharing .",
    "the so formed fe@xmath3-ions in the contact layer have an impurity state of @xmath43 symmetry ( @xmath44 ) that is pinned at the fermi level for systems strained at a@xmath35  and a@xmath34 .",
    "such a mid - gap state was recently reported from x - ray valence band photoemission  @xcite and optical measurements  @xcite , although it was related to the low oxygen pressure during deposition .",
    "the main feature related to strain is the change in band width : while for tensile strain at a@xmath34  the bands are narrowed , for compressive strain at a@xmath40  they are strongly broadened .",
    "this results in a reduction of the band gap ( between the impurity state defining the fermi level and the bottom of the conduction band ) from 1.90  ev for a@xmath34  and 1.79  ev for a@xmath35  to 1.43  ev for a@xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath45 show the same trend but are smaller : 1.64  ev for a@xmath34  and 1.46  ev for a@xmath35  to 0.78  ev for a@xmath40 . the local magnetic moments and total magnetization for the three systems with @xmath39 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] .",
    "strain has only a small impact on the magnetic moments of fe@xmath3  ( @xmath46 ) and fe@xmath4  ( @xmath47 ) respectively which are reduced by less than 0.05 @xmath48 at a@xmath40 .",
    "the fe@xmath3-layer sandwiched between two ti - layers in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]a is only weakly coupled to the next fe - layer ( parallel and antiparallel orientation of the magnetic moments is nearly degenerate as in the ilmenite end member ) .",
    "therefore , at temperatures above the nel temperature of ilmenite , such layers will not contribute to the total magnetization .",
    "in contrast , fe@xmath3  in the contact layer shows a strong antiferromagnetic coupling to the neighboring fe - layer of the hematite host .",
    "these defect interface moments are responsible for the ferrimagnetic behavior of the system ( @xmath49 ) . in solid solutions , ti substitution in different spin - sublattices ( _ e.g.",
    "_  in adjacent layers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]c ) , resulting in a zero net magnetization , is less favorable compared to substitution in the same spin - sublattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]b ) , which maximizes the total magnetization ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this trend promotes ferrimagnetic behavior in the system .",
    "density functional theory calculations within gga+@xmath0 show that the charge compensation in hematite - ilmenite heterostructures and solid solutions takes place through a mixed fe@xmath3 , fe@xmath4  contact layer .",
    "this mechanism is robust with respect to substrate - induced strain . for fe@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) or fetio@xmath2(0001 ) substrates layered arrangements are more stable than solid solutions",
    ". however , the compressive strain at a@xmath40  is likely to cause a stronger competition and even reverse the trend for @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "the growth of epitaxial films on an al@xmath1o@xmath2-substrate is connected with a high energy cost .",
    "therefore , in order to release strain such films may roughen or buckle in the first layers as recently reported by popova  _ et al . _",
    "in contrast , the growth on lattice matched substrates or even substrates that produce a small tensile strain like fetio@xmath2  is energetically favored .",
    "our dft results indicate that strain can have a strong impact on the structural and electronic properties in the hematite - ilmenite system : _ e.g. _  by tuning the band width or the position of impurity levels in the band gap and thus changing the concentration of spin - polarized carriers .",
