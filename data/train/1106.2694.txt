    "a _ geometric right - angle crossing drawing _ ( or _ geometric rac drawing _ , for short ) of a graph is a straight - line drawing in which every pair of crossing edges intersects at right - angle . a graph which admits a geometric rac drawing",
    "is called _ right - angle crossing graph _ ( or _ rac graph _ , for short ) . motivated by cognitive experiments of huang et al.@xcite , which indicate that the negative impact of an edge crossing on the human understanding of a graph drawing is eliminated in the case where the crossing angle is greater than seventy degrees , rac graphs were recently introduced in @xcite as a response to the problem of drawing graphs with optimal crossing resolution .",
    "_ simultaneous graph drawing _",
    "deals with the problem of drawing two ( or more ) planar graphs on the same set of vertices on the plane , such that each graph is drawn planar ( i.e. , only edges of different graphs are allowed to cross ) .",
    "the _ geometric _ version restricts the problem to straight - line drawings . besides its independent theoretical interest ,",
    "this problem arises in several application areas , such as software engineering , databases and social networks , where a visual analysis of evolving graphs , defined on the same set of vertices , is useful .",
    "both problems mentioned above are active research topics in the graph drawing literature and positive and negative results are known for certain variations ( refer to section  [ sec : related - work ] ) . in this paper , we present the first combinatorial results for the _ geometric simultaneous rac drawing problem _ ( or _ gsimrac _ drawing problem , for short ) , i.e. , a combination of both problems . formally , the @xmath0 drawing problem can be stated as follows : let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two planar graphs that share a common vertex set but have disjoint edge sets , i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the main task is to place the vertices on the plane so that , when the edges are drawn as straight - lines , ( i )  each graph is drawn planar , ( ii )  there are no edge overlaps , and , ( iii )  crossings between edges in @xmath6 and @xmath7 occur at right - angles .",

    "we refer to this relationship as the _ rac - size constraint_.    if two graphs do not admit a geometric simultaneous drawing they , obviously , do not admit a @xmath0 drawing .",
    "for instance , since it is known that there exists a planar graph and a matching that do not admin a geometric simultaneous drawing @xcite , as a consequence , the same graph and matching do not admit a @xmath0 drawing either .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonrac - graph - example ] depicts an alternative and simpler technique to prove such negative results , which is based on the fact that not all graphs that obey the rac - size constraint are eventually rac graphs . on the other hand , as we will shortly see , if two graphs always admit a geometric simultaneous drawing , it is not necessary that they also admit a @xmath0 drawing .",

    "the path remains @xmath27-monotone ( but not strictly anymore ) and hence planar .",
    "in addition , it is not possible to introduce vertex overlaps , since in the produced drawing each edge of @xmath43 has at least two units length ( recall that @xmath59 ) .",
    "since the vertices of the drawing do not occupy even @xmath27-coordinates , the width of the drawing can be reduced from @xmath23 to @xmath73 ( see figure  [ fig : path - matching - final ] ) .",
    "we can further reduce the width of the produced drawing by merging consecutive columns that do not interfere in @xmath28-direction into a common column ( see figure  [ fig : path - matching - final - improved ] ) . however",

    "consider now the more interesting case where @xmath86 is not a leaf in the dual tree of @xmath11 . in this case , we draw two circles , say @xmath100 and @xmath101 , centered at @xmath99 that both lie entirely within semi - strip @xmath98 and do not touch neither line @xmath96 nor line @xmath97 .",
    "assume that circle @xmath101 is the external of the two circles . from point @xmath90",
    "draw the tangent to circle @xmath100 and let @xmath102 be the point it touches @xmath100 and @xmath103 be the point to the right of @xmath102 where the tangent intersects circle @xmath101 ( see figure  [ fig : outerplanar - genaral - case ] ) . similarly , we define points @xmath104 and @xmath105 based on the tangent from point @xmath91 to circle @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the number of vertices defining face @xmath86 .",
    "the case where @xmath107 will be examined later .",
    "draw @xmath108 points on the @xmath109 arc , which is furthest from segment @xmath94 .",
    "these points , say @xmath110 , together with points @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 form face @xmath86 .",
    "observe that from point @xmath99 , we can draw perpendicular lines towards each edge of the face . indeed , line segments @xmath113 and @xmath114 are perpendicular to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the remaining edges of the face are chords of circle @xmath117 and thus , we can always draw perpendicular lines to their midpoints from the center @xmath99 of the circle . now , from each of the newly inserted points of face @xmath86 draw a semi - line that is parallel to semi - line @xmath96 and lies entirely in the semi - strip @xmath98 .",
    "we observe all invariant properties stated above hold for each child of face @xmath86 in the subtree @xmath89 of the dual of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , our algorithm can be applied recursively .",
    "the case where the number @xmath118 of vertices defining face @xmath86 is equal to @xmath37 can be easily treated .",
    "we simply use the intersection of the two tangents , say @xmath119 , as the third point of the triangular face .",
    "we have to be careful so that @xmath119 lies inside the semi - strip .",
    "however , we can always select a point @xmath99 close to segment @xmath94 and an appropriately small radius for circle @xmath100 , so that @xmath119 is inside @xmath98 .    now that we have described the recursive step of the algorithm , it is easy to define how the recursion begins ( see figure  [ fig : outerplanar - beginning ] ) .",
    "we start from any face of @xmath11 that is a leaf at its dual tree , say face @xmath120 .",
    "we draw the face as regular polygon , with face - vertex @xmath120 mapped to the center , say @xmath121 , of the polygon .",
    "let @xmath122 be the only edge of the face that is internal to the outerplane embedding of @xmath11 .",
    "without loss of generality , assume that @xmath123 is drawn vertically .",
    "then , draw the horizontal semi - lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 from the endpoints of @xmath123 in order to define the semi - strip @xmath98 . from this point on , the algorithm can recursively draw the remaining faces of @xmath11 and its dual .",
    "we note that the produced @xmath20 drawing of @xmath11 and its dual @xmath19 simply proves that producing such drawings is feasible .",
    "the drawing is not particularly appealing since the height of the strips quickly becomes very small .",
    "however , it is a starting point towards algorithms that produce better layouts .",
    "also note that the algorithm performs a linear number of `` point computations '' since for each face - vertex of the dual tree the performed computations are proportional to the degree of the face - vertex .",
    "however , the coordinates of some points may be non - rational numbers .",
    "in this paper , we introduced and examined geometric simultaneous rac drawings .",
    "our study raises several open problems . among them",
    "are the following :    1 .",
    "what other non - trivial classes of graphs , besides a matching and either a path or a cycle , admit a @xmath0 drawing ?",
    "we considered only geometric simultaneous rac drawings . for",
    "the classes where @xmath0 drawings are not possible , study drawings with bends .",
    "3 .   we demonstrated by an example that if two graphs always admit a geometric simultaneous drawing , it is not necessary that they also admit a @xmath0 drawing . finding a class of graphs ( instead of a particular graph ) with this property would strengthen this result .",
    "4 .   obtain more appealing @xmath20 drawings for an outerplanar graph and its dual .",
