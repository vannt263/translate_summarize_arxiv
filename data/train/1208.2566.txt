    "bylander @xcite made an extensive analysis of the computational complexity of propositional strips  under various restrictions , like limiting the number of preconditions or effects .",
    "bckstrm and nebel @xcite made a similar analysis of planning with multi - valued state variables in the sas@xmath0  formalism , investigating the complexity of all combinations of the p , u , b and s restrictions introduced by bckstrm and klein @xcite .",
    "these were among the first attempts to understand why and when planning is hard or easy and have had heavy influence on recent research in planning , of which we list a few representative examples .",
    "gimnez and jonsson @xcite , chen and gimnez @xcite as well as katz and domshlak @xcite have studied the complexity of planning for various restrictions on the causal graph , the latter also considering combinations with restrictions p and u. katz and domshlak further pointed out a particularly important usage of such results , saying :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ computational tractability can be an invaluable tool even for dealing with problems that fall outside all the known tractable fragments of planning .",

    "helmert @xcite used a planning algorithm for a simpler restricted problem to compute heuristic values for subproblems and then combine these values .",
    "similarly , the popular @xmath1 heuristic @xcite exploits bylander s results that planning is simpler with only positive preconditions and uses this as a relaxation for computing a heuristic value . as a complement to such analyses of restricted planning lanugages , helmert @xcite studied the complexity and inherent restrictions in a number of application problems .",
    "we revisit these early classifications of strips  and of sas@xmath0 , but using parameterized complexity analysis rather than standard complexity analysis .",
    "parameterized complexity analysis was invented to enable a more fine - grained analysis than standard complexity analysis allows , by treating a parameter as independent of the instance rather than being a part of it .",
    "somewhat simplified , the idea is as follows .",
    "consider some problem and let @xmath2 denote the instance size .",
    "we usually consider a problem as tractable if it can be solved by some algorithm in @xmath3 time , that is , in polynomial time .",
    "for many problems , like the -hard problems , we do not know of any significantly faster way to solve them than doing brute - force search , which typically requires requires exponential , or at least super - polynomial , time in @xmath2 . in practice",
    "the search is often not exponential in the size of the whole instance , but rather in some smaller hard part of it . in these cases",
    "the complexity may rather be something like @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a parameter that is typically independent of the instance size @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the combinatorial explosion is confined to the parameter  @xmath5 .",
    "we say that a problem is _ fixed - parameter tractable ( fpt ) _ if it can be solved in this way .",
    "this is the essence of parameterized complexity theory and provides a tractability concept which is more relaxed than the usual one , while correlating better with tractability in practice for real - world problems .",
    "the theory also offers various classes for problems that are not fpt , for example @xmath6}}}$ ] and @xmath7}}}$ ] .",
    "parameterized complexity analysis has contributed fundamental new insights into complexity theory @xcite .",
    "it is nowadays a very common technique in many areas of computer science , including many subareas of ai , like non - monotonic reasoning @xcite , constraints @xcite , social choice @xcite and argumentation @xcite .",
    "the examples in planning are rare , however .",
    "downey , fellows and stege @xcite proved that strips  planning is @xmath6}}}$]-hard and conjectured that it is also complete for @xmath6}}}$ ] .",
    "we disprove this conjecture and show that strips   planning is actually @xmath7}}}$]-complete .",
    "there is also a result by bckstrm and jonsson @xcite that strips  planning is fpt under a certain restriction that deliberately lower - bounds the plan length , thus not contradicting our results .",
    "this restriction was motivated by a different agenda , studying the expressive power of planning languages in general rather than subclasses of a particular  language .",
    "the parameterized analyses of planning that we provide in this paper does not replace the earlier results or make them obsolete .",
    "since the parameterized complexity classes and the standard ones are not comparable , our results must be viewed as supplementary , providing further information .",
    "if we consider the previous classifications together with our parameterized classification we get a more detailed and informative picture of planning complexity than by considering either of them alone .",
    "this sheds new light on the discrepancy between theoretical and practical results regarding the difficulty of planning .",
    "for instance , while bckstrm and nebel proved that restriction u ( actions can change only one variable ) does not make planning easier under standard analysis , we show that it is actually easier from a parameterized point of view .",
    "this is interesting since restriction u has been considered acceptable in some practical applications of planning , for instance on - board planning in spacecrafts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bckstrm and nebel showed that planning is -hard under restriction p ( there are never two actions that set the same variable value ) but did not provide any better upper bound than in the unrestricted case .",
    "we show that planning is actually fpt under this restriction .",
    "we also show that a standard partial - order planning algorithm @xcite can exploit this fact with a minor modification that could be implemented as a heuristic .",
    "this suggests that many successful applications of planning might be cases where the problem is `` almost tractable '' and the algorithm used happens to implicitly exploit this .",
    "this is in line with the claim by downey et .",
    "@xcite that in many cases existing algorithms with heuristics turn out to already be fpt algorithms .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section 2 defines some concepts of parameterized complexity theory and section 3 defines the sas@xmath0   and strips  languages .",
    "the hardness results are collected in section 4 and the membership results in section 5 , including the result on using an existing planning algorithm .",
    "section 6 summarizes the results of the paper and discusses some observations and consequences .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion in section  7 .",
    "we define the basic notions of parameterized complexity and refer to other sources  @xcite for an in - depth treatment .",
    "parameterized problem _ is a set of pairs @xmath8 , the _ instances _ , where @xmath9 is the main part and @xmath5 the _ parameter_.",
    "the parameter is usually a non - negative integer .",

    "parameterized complexity offers a completeness theory , similar to the theory of np - completeness , that allows the accumulation of strong theoretical evidence that some parameterized problems are not fixed - parameter tractable .",

    "this is an important observation since many application and example problems in planning satisfy these constraints , for instance , many variants of the logistics domain used in the international planning competitions .",
    "since planners like nonlin and snlp are practical variants of mar , this may help to explain the gap between empirical and theoretical results for many applications .",
    "the use of parameterized analysis in planning is by no means restricted to using plan length as parameter .",
    "we did so only to get results that are as comparable as possible with the previous results .",

    "@xcite show that strips  planning can be recast as the signed digraph pebbling problem which is modelled as a special type of graph .",
    "they analyse the parameterized complexity of this problem considering also the treewidth of the graph as a parameter . as another example ,",
    "chen and gimnez @xcite show that planning is in  if the size of the connected components in the causal graph is bounded by a constant , and otherwise unlikely to be in .",
    "it seems natural to study this also from a parameterized point of view , using the component size as the parameter .",
    "it should also be noted that the parameter need not be a single value ; it can itself be a combination of two or more other parameters .",
    "there are close ties between model checking and planning and this connection deserves further study .",
    "for instance , model - checking traces can be viewed as plans and vice versa  @xcite , and methods and results have been transferred between the two areas in both directions @xcite .",
