    "nowadays , possibility to control quantum states of a single or a couple of electron spins , in particular in quantum dots or electronic gases , is still at the heart of developments towards a scalable spin - based quantum computer because this control in combination with controlled exchange between neighboring spins , would let obtain universal quantum operations @xcite in agreement with divincenzo criteria @xcite in terms of reliability of state preparation and identification of well identified qubits .",

    "normally , because these aspects generate simplifications on geometry as in properties of physical systems involved too @xcite .    to develop results related with control , we adopt the following hamiltonian recently developed for the bipartite anisotropic ising model @xcite including an inhomogeneous magnetic field restricted to the @xmath0-direction ( @xmath1 at time , corresponding with @xmath2 ) :    @xmath3    it generalizes several models considered in control in the previously cited works . in the same terms and notation that @xcite , diagonalization of hamiltonian to obtain the corresponding eigenvalues which are independent of @xmath0 :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as :    @xmath7    and @xmath8 is understood as a cyclic permutation of @xmath9 which it is simplified in that work by using @xmath10 as equivalent to the pair of scripts @xmath11 .",

    "with the notation settled in that work , capital scripts @xmath16 are reserved for @xmath17 referred to the computational basis ; greek scripts for @xmath15 or @xmath14 ; latin scripts @xmath18 for spatial coordinates",

    "when each set of equations ( [ diag ] ) and ( [ adiag ] ) are solved , all equations in each set are necessary conditions to make antidiagonal or diagonal entries equal to zero , respectively .",
    "for one pulse diagonal case , weakening unitary global phase for @xmath107 , we can obtain at time @xmath196 , diagonal matrices with the next form in each diagonal sector ( @xmath197 ) :    @xmath198    if we have the following restriction in each magnetic field ( for @xmath199 corresponding with each sector ) :    @xmath200    where @xmath201 and @xmath196 is a free parameter .",
    "this operation is not precisely an evolution loop because it does not assign a global phase to all states , instead , it assigns different phases to bell states by pairs and then introduces phases in each term of a linear superpositions in other general states .",
    "these procedures let to obtain more general diagonal forms for @xmath107 than those obtained before , with the structure :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 are @xmath204 independently and depending on parameters selected .",
    "these structures were introduced in @xcite .      for",
    "two pulses diagonal - antidiagonal case , note that ( [ diag ] ) and ( [ adiag ] ) are the more general solutions to obtain an diagonal - antidiagonal evolution matrix .",
    "first and third equations in ( [ diag2 ] ) are still general conditions to adjust a sector on diagonal form .",
    "second equation was used only to get a non - zero entry real , so we do not use more here . for remaining antidiagonal sector , ( [ adiag2 ] )",
    "are no more the general conditions because they are specifically constructed to obtain both non zero entries just real or imaginary . instead ,",
    "( [ adiag ] ) are the general rule . resuming , both general prescriptions give the following general diagonal ( @xmath205 ) and antidiagonal ( @xmath206)combined sectors respectively for two pulses :    @xmath207    here , we are using @xmath157 for diagonal sector and @xmath156 for antidiagonal one .",
    "script in @xmath208 should remember that this factor is related with @xmath156 as in ( [ sector ] ) . here ,",
    "@xmath209 and @xmath210 , the pulse durations , are parameters involved in the whole set of restrictions , which we repeat just for clarity . for diagonal sector @xmath157 :    @xmath211    with @xmath212 .",
    "this equation is easier to solve than in last section because @xmath209 and @xmath210 are set as parameters , so this pair of equations are not coupled with those of antidiagonal sector . for antidiagonal sector @xmath156 :    @xmath213    similarly , these set of equations can be solved by noting that second equation only adjust the correct combination of signs . taking again @xmath214 as parameters which lets consider @xmath215 independent from @xmath216 .",
    "then , by expressing @xmath215 in terms of @xmath217 , first and second equations can be solved simultaneously to find @xmath216 for specific values of @xmath217 .",
    "the diagonal - antidiagonal forms in two pulses become , to exchange @xmath218 or @xmath219 :    @xmath220    to exchange @xmath221 or @xmath222 :    @xmath223    to exchange @xmath224 or @xmath225 :    @xmath226    where @xmath189 and second superscript , @xmath227 , in @xmath228 denotes the antidiagonal sector .",
    "an important property is that the set including @xmath229 and @xmath228 , with @xmath230 fixed , forms an abelian group because @xmath231 .",
    "note that if @xmath232 are @xmath233 and @xmath234 we recover forms analyzed in the previous subsection .",
    "all of them , @xmath235 act on bell states to maintain them or exchange between them periodically . for other states ,",
    "these operations insert programmed phases in their different components .",
    "all these operations could be written in terms of standard quantum computational gates and could give generalizations to some of these gates . nevertheless , in the following",
    ", we will analyze only the cases with @xmath236 and will set signs @xmath203 to have @xmath237 in the first row of each sector as in ( [ diagadiagforms ] ) , similarly as in the standard algorithm in terms of @xmath238 gate .",
    "diagonal - antidiagonal matrices as ( [ diagadiagforms ] ) and @xmath239 should remember @xmath240 gates but applied to scripts of bell states @xmath241 instead of those of @xmath242 ( by extending momentarily our notation under the equivalence : @xmath243 ) .",
    "in fact , if we realize that @xmath244 is almost @xmath245 gate ( understood as its straight form to bell basis ) except for sign changed in entry @xmath246 , or concisely , @xmath247 , we can get :    @xmath248    where @xmath249 are pauli matrices forms .",

    "we should remember that all of these equalities are only based on matrix form , they are not the standard gates in computational basis . anyway , this sets of operations give some alternative procedures those of quantum computing based on circuits model .    in last sense , because the operation @xmath256 transforms computational basis into bell basis ( here , @xmath257 is the hadamard gate applied on channel @xmath62 ) , whole last operations in computational basis could be expressed as @xmath258 and similarly for @xmath259 ( @xmath260 superscript denotes that gate is written in the computational basis representation ) . for @xmath261 and @xmath262",
    ", its expressions shows that it transforms computational basis states into states with uniform probability distribution in that basis ( with different phases inserted ) . for @xmath263 ,",
    "this states are still exchange operators between some elements of computational basis ( @xmath264 ) , one at time . for @xmath265 (",
    "defined similarly as a computational basis representation ) and @xmath263 we get an operation which introduces symmetrical phases between groups of their elements exactly as in the bell basis representation .",
    "for @xmath262 we get an operation which generates combinations between basis elements weighted by @xmath266 ( rotation of bipartite qubits as a whole ) .",
    "in addition to our interest based on evolution loops and exchange operations , driven ising operations explained in previous section , @xmath267 , suggest be used as natural operations replacing standard gates in quantum computing .",
    "one immediate example is teleportation algorithm .",
    "if we begin as commonly with the state @xmath268 with the first qubit to teleport in possession of alice and bell state first in possession of bob , who send its first part to alice .",
    "alice drives ising interaction as in our model applying @xmath269 operation on them . with this , they almost obtain the standard teleportation algorithm for one qubit @xcite :    @xmath270    where for simplicity , in order to identify easily the results in computational basis , we are comeback briefly to classical notation for bell states .    after to apply ising interaction , alice makes a measurement in computational basis on two first qubits .",
    "results are listed in table i where @xmath271 are the eigenstates of @xmath272 .",
    "thus , alice uses classical communication to send outcomes to bob who finally apply adequate gates ( table i ) to obtain the original state .",
    "it is clear that bob will require apply a hadamard gate at the end and if measurement result is @xmath273 , then it is precise to apply in addition @xmath274 to teleportate the original qubit on qubit 3 in his possesion .",
    "another alternative for alice is make a measurement in bell basis @xmath241 , then to send the result to bob , in such case , he will need apply @xmath275 .",
    ".measurement outcomes for qubits @xmath276 and @xmath277 , output state in qubit @xmath278 and complementary gates for teleportation algorithm based on @xmath269 .",
    "first four rows after of titles corresponds to measurements in the computational basis and last four to bell basis measurement . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where @xmath279 is the identity gate for a single qubit .",
    "this example shows that physical interactions , as driven ising model , could be used to reproduce standard gates proposed in quantum computing , or otherwise , those gates can be equivalently replaced by quantum physical processes .",
    "as was obtained in @xcite , concurrence of states evolved from bell states , @xmath280 , with @xmath42 from ( [ hamiltonian ] ) becomes :    @xmath281    exhibiting a simple behavior depending only on one rabi frequency , in contrast with evolution of other states , specially separable ones .",
    "this expression is consistent with isotropic case reported in @xcite and with results ( [ evloop2 ] ) and ( [ diagadiag2]-[diagadiag3 ] ) .",
    "but it implies a more general feature in spite that not for all physical parameters in the current interaction , bell states comeback each period to their original states , but instead into another state with maximal entanglement , denoting a natural correspondence between maximal entanglement with current ising interaction model . in another perspective , intermediate stages of evolution for initially bell states",
    "does not always become separable . only if @xmath282 , then @xmath283 reaches its maximum value .",
    "it means , when @xmath284 , the perfect tuning between field and strength interaction .      as in @xcite ,",
    "presence of parasitic magnetic fields could affect the stability of maximal entanglement .",
    "thus , if qubits are currently exposed to magnetic fields @xmath285 respectively , then maximal entangled values of evolution of bell states have oscillations with frequencies @xmath286 by pairs in agreement with ( [ erres ] ) and ( [ bellentanglement ] ) .",
    "in that situation , an homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath287 , can be added to tune the oscillation frequency of entanglement of all bell states under evolution by requiring : @xmath288 ( where @xmath289 ) .",
    "magnetic field @xmath287 becomes :    @xmath290    other possible desired effect is maximize the oscillation amplitude for concurrence in order to assure that there are periodical intermediate separable states . in this case ,",
    "an homogeneous field @xmath287 is sufficient to reach this effect for those bell states associated in ( [ bellentanglement ] ) with @xmath291 for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "we need to get a new effective field @xmath292 , it implies :    @xmath293    nevertheless , for bell states associated with @xmath294 in ( [ bellentanglement ] ) , selective fields on each qubit @xmath295 , @xmath296 , should be applied , in such way that they fulfill :    @xmath297    finally , it is clear that under these kind of effects , it is possible nullify @xmath294 or @xmath291 in order to set invariant some bell states ( as in @xcite for isotropic ising interaction ) . in this cases ,",
    "some of eigenvalues ( [ eigenvectors ] ) become bell states .",
    "nowadays , research about physical systems on which set up quantum technology , in particular that related with quantum computation , quantum information processing or quantum cryptography are growing since several directions to get them in an useful form for those applications .",

    "quantum storage and processing of information allow new computational tasks which are impossible with conventional information technology or quantum optics exclusively . in this trend , systems based on trapped ions , e - helium , nuclear magnetic resonance , superconductors , doped silicon and quantum dots have shown opportunities to make stable and efficient developments for that purpose @xcite .",
    "such quantum stuff requires a system of several qubits .",
    "the main materials based technology known for that purpose is magnetic . for this reason",
    ", spin - based quantum computing has been developed in several experimental implementations , which uses magnetic systems mainly : superconducting integrated systems , superconducting flux qubits , straight nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum dots .",
    "all of them exploits ising interactions with different approaches @xcite , together with control on quantum states and in particular with entanglement control , a milestone in all almost these researches .",
    "circuit - gate model was the first approach to quantum computation , nevertheless , quantum annealing @xcite or measurement - based quantum computation @xcite are alternatives which use magnetic systems approached by ising interactions to manage a planned and controlled quantum state manipulation . on them",

    "several aspects around of stability to set these elements as isolated qubits has been solved in parallel with their control of quantum properties as those here studied .",
    "nevertheless than in the current time , deep control of parameters in quantum magnetic systems is still limited , the study of ising model in a comprehensive way , by including several freedom degrees as manipulable ( in particular ising interaction strengths ) opens future opportunities to explode all their computable possibilities . otherwise ,",

    "these operations are useful by themselves in discrimination and/or quantum state correction @xcite .",
    "still , these operations , more than their own properties , are settled on an specific basis : bell states . by combining these operations ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) in different directions we can increase possibilities about entanglement control as stated in figure [ fig1 ] or in terms of basic results in section [ secvi ] .",
