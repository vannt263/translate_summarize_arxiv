    "new magnetic flux of the sun always appears as a bipolar magnetic region ( bmr ) from below in form of two distinct types .",
    "one is the emerging flux region ( efr ) , the other is the ephemeral region ( er ) .",
    "efr is an important ingredient in active region fields which sometimes can be seen as large - scale patterns , e.g. active longitudes defined as a sequence of active regions appearing in the preferred longitudinal bands ( gaizauskas et al .",
    "er is relatively small and short - lived ( about 1 day ) , thus it distributes more randomly . in this paper , using solar magnetic synoptic charts we investigate patterns in emergence of the long - lived ( at least 1 rotation ) bmrs during solar activity minima .",
    "the emergence of bmrs during solar minima is a very classical topic , addressed by many people , e.g. howard & labonte 1981 , howard 1989 , wang & sheeley 1989 , harvey & zwaan 1993 , and many others . differing from former works , here more attention",
    "is paid to the variability of bmrs emerging rate and the typical longitudinal distance among them .",
    "it is believed that such information can provide hints for understanding the origin of solar magnetic fields .",
    "as the main source of data , we have used nso / kitt peak solar magnetic synoptic charts and soho / mdi synoptic charts . for our purpose",
    "we choose three time intervals of solar minima : carrington rotation ( cr ) 1754 - 1793 , cr1891 - 1930 and cr2035 - 2049 . during the former two time intervals we use kitt peak synoptic charts and during the last time interval , we use soho / mdi charts since kitt peak charts are not available after cr2007 . when dealing with the high resolution soho / mdi charts , we resized the grid from @xmath1 to the kitt peak s grid @xmath2 .",
    "to identify bmrs in each solar magnetic synoptic chart , we set three criteria .",
    "( 1 ) a bmr should possess strong magnetic fields . here",
    "all pixels with absolute value lower than 20 gauss are set to zero ( see an example in figure 1 ) because they are thought to be related to the quiet sun and network magnetic fields ( rabin et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "( 2 ) bmr s two polarities should distribute closely and weight balanced ; ( 3 ) it should do not exist in the former cr and leave an obvious track in the following cr .",
    "therefore the bmrs chosen for every cr should be new and long - lived . also for this reason",
    ", the statistic of bmrs distribution wo nt be affected by the evolution of the relatively random ers . after finding a bmr ,",
    "we outline its region and calculate its absolute flux gravity center . in order to cut down the latitudinal measurement errors ,",
    "we have used a linear interpolation method to re - map synoptic charts sine latitude into equal latitude . as shown in figure 2 ,",
    "all bmrs found during cr1906 - 1925 are signed together by circles .",
    "the center of circle marks the bmr s flux gravity center ( or bmr s position ) .",
    "figure 3 depicts the latitudinal distribution of solar emerging bmrs during the three chosen time intervals ( cr1754 - 1793 , cr1891 - 1930 and cr2035 - 2049 ) .",
    "according to the sprer law we can easily draw the separatrix between the old and new solar cycles . here",
    "we can see clearly that there is a very special bmr ( see the arrow in figure 3 ) .",
    "following the discussion of de toma et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we also think this bmr belongs to cycle 23 and just emerged much earlier .",
    "bmrs emerging rates ( the number of new bmrs per cr ) during each solar cycles are computed .",
    "the result is shown in the left panel of figure 4 where the solid lines indicate bmrs of the old solar cycles and the dashed lines indicate bmrs of the new solar cycles . using a least - square linear fit",
    ", we find the bmrs emerging rates during the end of cycles 21 , 22 descend at an average rate of @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath4 , while the emerging rates ascend at a rate of @xmath6 @xmath4 and @xmath7 @xmath4 during the beginning of cycles 22 , 23 ( regardless of the special bmr mentioned in the above paragraph )",
    ". therefore bmrs emerging rates of new cycles increase about 3 times faster than those of old cycles decrease .",
    "the right panel of figure 4 shows the sunspot number during the same time intervals .",
    "we find the sunspot curves in the right panel are very similar to the bmr curves in the left panel .",
    "some local differences mainly come from the fact we only compute the new bmrs during each cr .",
    "figure 3 and figures 4a , 4b show that two consecutive solar cycles overlap about 10 crs . during such overlapping period the bmrs emerging rate",
    "gets the least .",
    "table 1 lists the longitudes of bmrs occurring during the overlapping time interval of cycles 21 , 22 and cycles 22 , 23 . from this",
    "we can find that most bmrs of the old and new cycles tend to concentrate in the same longitudes .",
    "bumba et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also found this phenomenon and suggested this would be due to the magnetic flux of the new cycle induced by the action of the old cycle magnetic flux .",
    "we mainly study the longitudinal distance ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 means the bmr s carrington longitude ) between every two bmrs of the same cycle , emerging in the same cr or @xmath10 cr ( @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 means the bmr s emerging time ) , and with a latitudinal distance of no more than @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 means the bmr s latitude ) .",
    "only two bmrs satisfying such three conditions can be called one bmr pair . here",
    "we totally find 155 qualified bmr pairs . due to the spherical solar surface ,",
    "each bmr pairs longitudinal distance @xmath17 should be also regarded as @xmath18 ( the unit of @xmath17 is @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , we add the number of bmr pairs with a distance @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the final result is shown by the dashed line in figure 5 ( for the bilateral symmetry , we just draw the former half @xmath20 $ ] ) . with a measurement of its smoothing effect",
    "( see the solid line in figure 5 ) , we find 82 ( or 53% ) bmr pairs to distribute near ( peak width at half - height , @xmath21 $ ] , see figure 5 ) four typical longitudinal distances : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "there is another distinct peak located at around @xmath26 .",
    "such @xmath17 is so small that we think it might originate from bmrs mutual action ( e.g. while a bmr emerging within another existing bmr , they may compete for place with each other ) or the differential rotation . in order to further check up our result ,",
    "we have carried out similar study for the new / old solar cycle and the northern / southern hemisphere separately , only to find that the peak positions are the same .",
    "very regular four peak positions , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , are separated up to multiples of @xmath27 .",
    "this phenomenon indicates that most bmrs tend to distribute with a longitudinal distance of 1/8 solar rotation .",
    "we think such rule should be related to the quantified distribution of solar magnetic field .",
    "gilman and dikpati ( 2000 ) ever showed the quantified property of active regions by simulating the pattern of low - order longitudinal modes . here",
    "a mode of @xmath0 would be more applicable during solar minima .",
    "song and wang ( 2005 ) found that about 55% solar strong magnetic fields can be represented by two longitudinal modes of @xmath28 .",
    "the different modes during solar minima suggest that all modes are indeed varying with solar cycle .",
    "in this paper we have studied the features of the emergence of long - lived bmrs during solar minima and can draw the following conclusions . ( 1 ) bmrs emerging rates of the new cycles increase about 3 times faster than those of the old cycles decrease . ( 2 ) two consecutive solar cycles have an overlapping period of about 10 crs . during this very short overlapping time interval ,",
    "bmrs of two cycles tend to concentrate in the same longitudes .",
    "( 3 ) about 53% bmrs distribute with a longitudinal distance of 1/8 solar rotation .",
    "this suggests a longitudinal mode of @xmath0 existing during solar minima .",
