    "orthogonal polynomials of two variables with respect to a nonnegative weight function that has all moments finite are known to exist ( @xcite ) .",
    "a basis of orthogonal polynomials can be written down , say , in terms of moments , but such a basis is often hard to work with . for studying orthogonal polynomials and orthogonal expansions ,",
    "additional structures are often called for . in the case of classical weight functions in two variables , for example ,",
    "an orthogonal basis can be expressed in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials of one variable .",
    "there are , however , not many such examples ; each additional one is valuable in its own right .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study orthogonal polynomials and orthogonal expansions with respect to a family of weight functions defined on @xmath0 ^ 2 $ ] , which includes as a special case @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the case",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 is the product gegenbauer weight functions , for which an orthogonal basis is given by product gagenbauer polynomials .",
    "we shall show that orthogonal polynomials for this family of weight functions can be expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials in one variable when @xmath9 .",
    "our study starts from a realization that it is possible to express the orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath10 in terms of the koornwinder polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath11 defined on the domain @xmath12 bounded by two lines and a parabola , @xmath13 orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath14 were first studied by koornwinder in @xcite , where an orthogonal basis is uniquely defined and shown to consist of eigenfunctions of two differential operators of order 2 and order 4 , respectively . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the orthogonal polynomials can be given in terms of the jacobi polynomials of one variable .",
    "further studies were carried out in @xcite ; in particular , explicit formula for the orthogonal polynomials were derived and various recursive relations were established .",
    "the connection to orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath10 is somewhat surprising , but simple in retrospect as can be seen by the relation @xmath15 as a result of the connection , an orthogonal basis for @xmath16 can be given explicitly in terms of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "an explicit orthogonal basis makes it possible to study orthogonal expansions , for which however it is essential to have access to the reproducing kernel of the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that closed forms of the reproducing kernels for @xmath19 and for @xmath20 , respectively , can be given in terms of the reproducing kernels of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "this allows us to prove several results on the convergence of the orthogonal expansions for these weight functions .",
    "the results include @xmath21 convergence of the partial sum operators and sharp estimate of the lebesgue constants .",
    "it is interesting to note that analogous result on the @xmath21 convergence has not been proven for the product jacobi series on the square ( the partial sum is defined in terms of polynomial subspace of total order , see remark 2.1 ) .",
    "in fact , as far as we know , @xmath22 appears to be the first family of weight functions on the unit square for which a comprehensive study of orthogonal expansions is possible .",
    "the koornwinder polynomials are derived from the symmetric orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function @xmath23 which are the generalized jacboi polynomials of @xmath24 type .",
    "the latter are the first case of the generalized jacobi polynomials of @xmath25 type studied by several authors ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and they motivated the jacobi polynomials of heckman and opdam @xcite associated with root systems .",
    "the connection between these @xmath24 polynomials and orthogonal polynomials for @xmath10 appears to be new .",
