    "among all the fundamental particles the neutrino occupies a unique place in many ways and as such it has shed light on many important aspects of our present understanding of nature and is believed to hold the key to the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "presently , the question of whether the neutrino has mass is one of the outstanding issues in particle physics , astrophysics , cosmology and theoretical physics in general .",
    "there are several theoretical , observational and experimental motivations which justify the searching for possible non - zero neutrino masses ( see i.e. @xcite for excellent older reviews on this matter ) .",
    "fermion masses in general are one of the major problems of the standard model . observation or non - observation of neutrino masses",
    "could introduce an useful new perspective on the subject . if massless they would be the only fermions with this property . a property which is not dictated by a fundamental underlying principle ( at least one which is known presently ) , such as gauge invariance in the case of the photon .",
    "if massive the question is why are their masses so much smaller than those of their charged partners .",
    "although theory alone can not predict neutrino masses , it is certainly true that they are strongly suggested by present theoretical models of elementary particles and most extensions of the standard model definitively require neutrinos to be massive .",
    "they therefore constitute a powerful probe of new physics at a scale larger than the electroweak scale .    some hints at accelerator experiments as the the observed indications of spectral distortion and deficit of solar neutrinos and the ratio of atmospheric @xmath1 neutrinos and their zenith distribution are naturally accounted by the oscillations of a massive neutrino .",
    "recent claims of the high - statistics high precision superkamiokande experiment are unambiguous and left little room for the scepticism .",
    "neutrinos are basic ingredients of astrophysics and cosmology . there may be a hot dark matter component ( hdm ) to the universe : simulations of structure formation fit the observations only when one has some 20 % of hdm , the best fit being two neutrinos with a total mass of 4.7 ev . if so , neutrinos would be , at least in quantity , one of the most important ingredients in the universe .",
    "there seems to be however some kind of conflict within cosmology itself : observations of distant objects favor a large cosmological constant instead of hdm",
    ".    regardless of mass and oscillations , astrophysical interest in the neutrino and their properties arises from the fact that it is copiously produced in high temperature and/or high density environment and it often dominates the physics of those astrophysical objects .",
    "the interactions of the neutrino with matter is so weak that it passes freely through any ordinary matter existing in the universe .",
    "this makes neutrinos to be a very efficient carrier of energy drain from optically thick objects .",
    "at the same time they give a good probe for the interior of such dense objects .",
    "for example , the solar neutrino flux is , together with heliosysmology , one of the two known probes of the solar core .",
    "a similar statement applies to the type - ii supernovas : the most interesting questions around supernovas , the explosion dynamics itself with the shock revival , and , the synthesis of the heaviest elements by r - process , could be positively affected by changes in the neutrino flux , e.g. by msw active or sterile conversions .",
    "finally , ultra high energy neutrinos are called to be useful probes of diverse distant astrophysical objects .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) should be copious emitters of @xmath2 s , providing both detectable point sources and an observable diffuse background which is larger in fact than the atmospheric neutrino background in the very high energy range .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) contains three left - handed neutrinos .",
    "the three neutrinos are represented by two - component weyl spinors @xmath3 each describing a left - handed fermion .",
    "they are upper components of weak isodoublets @xmath4 , they have @xmath5 and an unit of the global ith lepton number . these standard model neutrinos are strictly massless .",
    "the only lorenz scalar made out of them is the majorana mass , of the form @xmath6 ; it has the quantum number of a weak isotriplet , with @xmath7 as well as two units of total lepton number . thus to generate a renormalizable majorana mass term at the tree level one needs a higgs isotriplet with two units of lepton number . since in the strict standard model higgs",
    "is a weak isodoublet higgs , there are no tree - level neutrino masses . if we want to consider quantum corrections we should consider effective terms where a weak isotriplet is made out of two isodoublets and which are not invariant under lepton number symmetry .",
    "the conclusion is that the standard model neutrinos are kept massless by global chiral lepton number symmetry ( and more general properties as renormalizability of the theory ) .",
    "however this is a rather formal conclusion , there is no any other independent , compelling theoretical argument in favor of such symmetry . or , with other words",
    ", there is not any reason why we would like to keep it intact .",
    "independent from mass oddities in any other respect neutrinos are very well behaved particles within the sm framework .",
    "some properties are unambiguously known about neutrinos .",
    "the lep line - shape measurement imply that are only three ordinary light neutrinos .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) constrains the parameters of possible sterile neutrinos ( which interact and are produced only by mixing ) . _",
    "all the existing _ data on the the weak interaction processes in which neutrinos take part are perfectly described by the standard model charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) lagrangians : @xmath8 the cc and nc interaction lagrangians conserve the total three lepton numbers @xmath9 while cc interactions determine the notion of flavor neutrinos @xmath10 .",
    "there are no indications in favor of violation of lepton numbers in weak processes . from the existing experiments very strong bounds on branching ratios of rare , lepton number violating ,",
    "processes are obtained , for example : @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xcite , 90% cl ) .",
    "any satisfactory model that generates neutrino masses must contain a natural mechanism that explains their small value , relative to that of their charged partners . given the latest experimental indications it would also be desirable that includes justification for light sterile neutrinos and near maximal mixing . to generate neutrino masses without new fermions",
    ", we must break lepton number by adding to the sm higgs fields carrying lepton numbers , one can arrange then to break lepton number explicitly or spontaneously through their interactions .",
    "possibly , the most familiar approach to give neutrino masses is , however , to introduce for each one an electroweak neutral singlet .",
    "this happens naturally in left - right symmetric models where the origin of sm parity violation is ascribed to the spontaneous breaking of a b - l symmetry . in the so(10 ) gut the majorana neutral particle n enters in a natural way in order to complete the matter multiplet , the neutral n is a @xmath13 singlet . according to the scale where they have relevant effects , unification ( i.e. the aforementioned so(10 ) gut ) and weak - scale approaches ( i.e. radiative models ) can be distinguished .",
    "phenomenologically , mass terms can be viewed as describing transitions between right ( r ) and left ( l)-handed states . for a set of four fields : @xmath14 , the most general mass part of the free - field lagrangian can be written as : @xmath15 in terms of the new majorana fields : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the lagrangian becomes : @xmath18 where the neutrino mass matrix is evident . diagonalizing",
    "this matrix one finds that the physical particle content is given by two majorana mass eigenstates : the inclusion of the majorana mass splits the four degenerate states of the dirac field into two non - degenerate majorana pairs .",
    "if we assume that the states @xmath19 are respectively active and sterile , the  majorana masses  @xmath20 and @xmath21 transform as weak triplets and singlets respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is an standard dirac mass term .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix can easily be generalized to three or more families , in which case the masses become matrices themselves .",
    "the complete flavor mixing comes from two different parts , the diagonalization of the charged lepton yukawa couplings and that of the neutrino masses . in most simple extensions of the standard model ,",
    "this ckm - like leptonic mixing is totally arbitrary with parameters only to be determined by experiment .",
    "their prediction , as for for the quark hierarchies and mixing , needs further theoretical assumptions ( i.e. ref.@xcite predicting @xmath23 maximal mixing ) .",
    "the case @xmath24 in eq.([e2003 ] ) corresponds to a purely dirac mass term . in this case @xmath19",
    "are degenerate with mass @xmath22 and a four component dirac field can be recovered as @xmath25 .",
    "the dirac mass term allows a conserved lepton number @xmath26 . for an ordinary dirac neutrino",
    "the @xmath27 is active and @xmath28 is weak sterile , an su(2 ) singlet , the mass term describes then a @xmath29 transition and is generated from su(2 ) breaking with a yukawa coupling : @xmath30 one has @xmath31 where v is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs doublet and @xmath32 is the corresponding yukawa coupling .",
    "a neutrino dirac mass is qualitatively just like any other fermion masses , but that leads to the question of why it is so small in comparison with the rest of fermion masses : one would require @xmath33 in order to have @xmath34 ev . or in other words : @xmath35 while for the hadronic sector we have @xmath36 .    a pure majorana mass transition term , @xmath20 or @xmath21 terms in lagrangian ( [ e2003 ] ) , describes in fact a particle - antiparticle transition violating lepton number by two units ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it can be viewed as the creation or annihilation of two neutrinos leading therefore to neutrinoless double beta decay .    for n",
    "a gauge singlet , a renormalizable mass term of the type @xmath38 is allowed by sm su(3)xsu(2)xu(1 ) symmetry .",
    "however , it would not be consistent in general with unified symmetries , i.e. with a full so(10 ) symmetry .",
    "in such theory the most straightforward possibility for generating a term like it in the full theory would be to include a * 126 * higgs and a yukawa coupling .",
    "alternatively , one can imagine more complicated interactions containing products of several simpler higgs fields . whatever the concrete model , the main point to have into account is that , it is strongly suggested that @xmath21 is associated with breaking of some unified symmetry , the expected scale for it should be in a large range covering from @xmath39 tev ( left - right models ) to gut scales @xmath40 gev ( from couplings unification ) .",
    "if @xmath27 is active then @xmath41=1 and @xmath20 must be generated by either an elementary higgs triplet or by an effective operator involving two higgs doublets arranged to transform as a triplet .",
    "for an elementary triplet @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a yukawa coupling and @xmath44 is the triplet vev .",
    "the simplest implementation ( the old gelmini - roncadelli model ) is excluded by the lep data on the z width : the corresponding majoron couples to the z boson increasing significantly its width .",
    "variant models involving explicit lepton number violation or in which the majoron is mainly a weak singlet ( invisible majoron models ) could still be possible .",
    "for an effective operator originated mass , one expects @xmath45 where m is the scale of the new physics which generates the operator .",
    "one can see this easily in the see - saw scheme : the n s communicate with the familiar fermions through the yukawa interactions ( eq.([e2005 ] ) .",
    "if n were massless the effect of eq.([e2005 ] ) would be to generate masses of the same order as ordinary quark and lepton masses .",
    "if n are massive enough yukawa and mass terms could be integrated out to generate an effective term of the type ( l , lepton doublet ) : @xmath46    in the seesaw limit in eq.([e2003 ] ) , taking @xmath47 , the two majorana neutrinos acquire respectively masses @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "there is one heavy neutrino and one neutrino much lighter than the typical dirac fermion mass .",
    "this is a natural way of generating two well separated mass scales .",
    "now we come again to the majorana mass @xmath21 for the sterile neutral n : @xmath21 can vary anywhere from the tev scale to the planck scale among the large quantity of proposed concrete seesaw and related models .",
    "the tev scale models are motivated , i.e. , by left - right symmetric models . with typical @xmath22 s ,",
    "one expects masses of order @xmath50 ev , 10 kev , and 1 mev for the @xmath10 respectively violating cosmological bounds unless heavy neutrinos decay rapidly and invisibly .",
    "gut motivated intermediate scales ( @xmath51 gev ) yield typical masses in the range relevant to hot dark matter , and solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations . for @xmath52 gev ( some superstring models , gut with multiple breaking stages ) one can obtain light neutrino masses of the order @xmath53 ev , @xmath54 ev , 10 ev ) . such range of masses would allow the interpretation of the solar and atmospheric deficits as , respectively , @xmath55 , @xmath56 oscillations .",
    "@xmath57 could be considered as a dark matter candidate . for @xmath58 ( grand unified seesaw with large higgs representations )",
    "one typically finds smaller masses around @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) ev somehow more difficult to fit into the present known experimental facts .",
    "models have been proposed where small tree level neutrino masses are obtained without making use of large scales . the model proposed by @xcite ( inspired by previous superstring models ) offers an example of the possibility of having neutrino mass matrices more general than that given by eq.([e2003 ] ) .",
    "the incorporation of additional iso - singlet neutral fermions @xmath62 leads to a matrix of the type : @xmath63 the smallness of neutrino masses is explained directly from the , otherwise left unexplained , smallness of the parameter @xmath64 in such a model .",
    "moreover , there would be neutrino mixing even if the light neutrino remains strictly massless ( @xmath65 ) .    the anomalies observed in the solar neutrino flux , atmospheric flux and low energy accelerator experiments",
    "can not all be explained consistently without introducing a light , then neccesarily sterile , neutrino . if all the majorana masses are small , active neutrinos can oscillate into the sterile right handed fields .",
    "light sterile neutrinos can appear in particular see - saw mechanisms if additional assumptions are considered (  singular see - saw  models ) with some unavoidable fine tuning .",
    "the alternative to such fine tuning would be seesaw - like suppression for sterile neutrinos involving new unknown interactions , i.e. family symmetries , resulting in substantial additions to the sm , ( i.e. some sophisticated superstring - inspired models , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , weak scale , radiative generated mass models where the neutrino masses are zero at tree level constitute a very different class of models : they explain in principle the smallness of @xmath66 for both active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "different mass scales are generated naturally by different number of loops involved in generating each of them .",
    "the actual implementation generally requires however the ad - hoc introduction of new higgs particles with nonstandard electroweak quantum numbers and lepton number - violating couplings @xcite .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment is another probe of possible new interactions .",
    "majorana neutrinos have identically zero magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "flavor transition magnetic moments are allowed however in general for both dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "limits obtained from laboratory experiments are of the order of a few @xmath67 and those from stellar physics or cosmology are @xmath68 . in the sm electroweak theory , extended to allow for dirac neutrino masses , the neutrino magnetic dipole moment is nonzero and given , as ( @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath71 to the neutrino mass is due to the absence of any interaction of @xmath28 other than its yukawa coupling which generates its mass . in left - right symmetric theories",
    "@xmath71 is proportional to the charged lepton mass : a value of @xmath72 can be reached still too small to have practical astrophysical consequences .",
    "magnetic moment interactions arise in any renormalizable gauge theory only as finite radiative corrections .",
    "the diagrams which generate a magnetic moment will also contribute to the neutrino mass once the external photon line is removed . in the absence of additional symmetries",
    "a large magnetic moment is incompatible with a small neutrino mass .",
    "the way out suggested by voloshin consists in defining a su(2)@xmath73 symmetry acting on the space @xmath74 , magnetic moment terms are singlets under this symmetry . in the limit of exact su(2)@xmath73 the neutrino mass is forbidden but @xmath71 is allowed .",
    "diverse concrete models have been proposed where such symmetry is embedded into an extension of the sm ( left - right symmetries , susy with horizontal gauge symmetries @xcite ) .",
    "no indications in favor of non - zero neutrino masses were found in direct kinematical searches :    1 .   from the measurement of the high energy part of the @xmath75 spectrum in the tritium decay : the troitsk and mainz experiments obtain respectively @xmath76 ev @xcite and mainz @xmath77 ev @xcite . both measurements are plagued by interpretation ambiguities : apparition of negative mass squared and bumps at the end of the spectrum .",
    "limits for the muon neutrino mass have been derived using the decay channel @xmath78 at intermediate energy accelerators ( psi , lanl ) .",
    "the present limits are @xmath79 kev @xcite .",
    "a tau neutrino mass of less than 30 mev is well established and confirmed by several experiments : limits of 28 , 30 and 31 mev have also been obtained by the opal , cleo and argus experiments respectively @xcite .",
    "the best upper limit for the @xmath80 neutrino mass has been derived using the decay mode @xmath81 by the aleph collaboration @xcite : @xmath82 18 mev ( 95% cl ) .",
    "many experiments on the search for neutrinoless double - beta decay [ @xmath83 , @xmath84 have been done .",
    "this process is possible only if neutrinos are massive and majorana particles .",
    "the matrix element of the process is proportional to the effective majorana mass @xmath85 .",
    "uncertainties in the precise value of upper limits are important since they depend on theoretical calculations of nuclear matrix elements . from the non - observation of @xmath86 the heidelberg - moscow ge experiment",
    "@xcite draws the limit @xmath87 ev ( 90% cl ) . in the next years",
    "it is expected an increase in sensitivity allowing limits down the @xmath88 ev level .",
    "many short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation experiments with reactor and accelerator neutrinos did not find any evidence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "for example experiments looking for @xmath89 or @xmath90 dissaperance @xcite or oscillations @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the first reactor long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment chooz found no evidence for neutrino oscillations in the @xmath92 disappearance mode @xcite .",
    "their results imply an exclusion region in the plane of the two - generation mixing parameters ( with normal or sterile neutrinos ) given approximately by @xmath93 for maximum mixing and @xmath94 for large @xmath95 , as shown in fig.([fchooz ] ) .",
    "chooz results are important for the atmospheric deficit problem : as it is seen in fig.([fchooz ] ) they are incompatible with an @xmath96 oscillation hypothesis for the solution of the atmospheric problem .",
    "los alamos lsnd experiment has reported indications of possible @xmath91 oscillations @xcite .",
    "they search for @xmath97 s in excess of the number expected from conventional sources at a liquid scintillator detector located 30 m from a proton beam dump at lampf .",
    "a @xmath98 signal has been detected via the reaction @xmath99 with @xmath100 energy between 36 and 60 mev , followed by a @xmath101 from @xmath102 ( 2.2 mev ) .",
    "a total @xmath97 excess of @xmath103 events has been obtained .",
    "if this excess is attributed to neutrino oscillations of the type @xmath91 , it corresponds to an oscillation probability of @xmath104 .",
    "the results of a similar search for @xmath105 oscillations where the @xmath106 are detected via the cc reaction @xmath107 provide a value for the corresponding oscillation probability of @xmath108 .",
    "the lsnd result has not been confirmed by the karmen experiment . the karmen experiment ( rutherford laboratories ) , following a similar experimental setup as lsnd , searches for @xmath109 produced by @xmath110 oscillations at a mean distance of 17.6 m. the time structure of the neutrino beam is important for the identification of the neutrino induced reactions and for the suppression of the cosmic ray background .",
    "systematic time anomalies not completely understood has been reported .",
    "the 1990 - 1995 and the latest 1997 - 1998 karmen data showed inconclusive results .",
    "they found no events , with an expected background of @xmath111 events , for @xmath91 oscillations , however the positive lsnd result in this channel could not be excluded in total either @xcite . at the end of 1999",
    ", the karmen sensitivity is expected to be able to exclude the whole parameter region of evidence suggested by lsnd if no oscillation signal were found ( fig.[flsnd ] ) .",
    "the first phase of a third pion beam dump experiment designed to set the lsnd - karmen controversy has been approved to run at fermilab .",
    "phase i of  boone  ( miniboone ) expects a 10 @xmath112 signal ( @xmath113 events ) and thus will make a decisive statement either proving or ruling it out .",
    "plans are to run early 2001 .",
    "additionally , there is a letter of intent of a similar experiment to be carried out at the cern ps @xcite .",
    "indications in the favor of neutrino oscillations were found in  all  solar neutrino experiments : the homestake cl radiochemical experiment with sensitivity down to the lower energy parts of the @xmath114b neutrino spectrum and to the higher @xmath115 be line .",
    "the two radiochemical @xmath116ga experiments , sage and gallex , which are sensitive to the low energy pp neutrinos and above and the water cerenkov experiments kamiokande and super - kamiokande ( sk ) which can observe only the highest energy @xmath114 b neutrinos .",
    "water cerenkov experiments in addition demonstrate directly that the neutrinos come from the sun showing that recoil electrons are scattered in the direction along the sun - earth axis .",
    "two important points to remark are : a ) the prediction of the existence of a global neutrino deficit is hard to modify due to the constraint of the solar luminosity on pp neutrinos detected at sage - gallex .",
    "b ) the different experiments are sensitive to neutrinos with different energy ranges and combined yield spectroscopic information on the neutrino flux .",
    "intermediate energy neutrinos arise from intermediate steps of the thermonuclear solar cycle",
    ". it may not be impossible to reduce the flux from the last step ( @xmath114b ) , for example by reducing temperature of the center of the sun , but it seems extremely hard to reduce neutrinos from @xmath117be to a large extent , while keeping a reduction of @xmath118b neutrinos production to a modest amount . if minimal standard electroweak theory is correct , the shape of the @xmath118 b neutrino energy spectrum is independent of all solar influences to very high accuracy .",
    "unless the experiments are seriously in error , there must be some problems with either our understanding of the sun or neutrinos . clearly",
    ", the ssm can not account for the data ( see fig.[ssm1 ] ) and possible highly nonstandard solar models are strongly constrained by heliosysmology studies ( see fig.([ssm2 ] ) ) .",
    "there are at least two reasonable particle physics explanations that could account for the suppression of intermediate energy neutrinos .",
    "the first one , neutrino oscillations in vacuum , requires a large mixing angle and a seemingly unnatural fine tuning of neutrino oscillation length with the sun - earth distance for intermediate energy neutrinos .",
    "the second possibility , level - crossing effect oscillations in presence of solar matter and/or magnetic fields of regular and/or chaotic nature ( msw , rsfp ) , requires no fine tuning either for mixing parameter or neutrino mass difference to cause a selective large reduction of the neutrino flux .",
    "this mechanism explains naturally the suppression of intermediate energy neutrinos , leaving the low energy pp neutrino flux intact and high energy @xmath118b neutrinos only loosely suppressed .",
    "concrete range of parameters obtained including the latest sk data will be showed in the next section .",
    "the high precision and high statistics super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment initiated operation in april 1996 .",
    "a few words about the detector itself .",
    "sk is a 50-kiloton water cerenkov detector located near the old kamiokande detector under a mean overburden of 2700 meter - water - equivalent .",
    "the effective fiducial volume is @xmath119 kt . it is a well understood , well calibrated detector .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute energy scale is estimated to be @xmath120 based on several independent calibration sources : cosmic ray through - going and stopping muons , muon decay electrons , the invariant mass of @xmath121 s produced by neutrino interactions , radioactive source calibration , and , as a novelty in neutrino experiments , a 5 - 16 mev electron linac .",
    "in addition to the ability of recording higher statistics in less time , due to the much larger dimensions of the detector , sk can contain multi - gev muon events making possible for the first time a measurement of the spectrum of @xmath64-like events up to @xmath122 gev / c .",
    "the results from the first 504 days of data from sk ( results presented recently at the neutrino98 conference @xcite ) , combined with data from earlier experiments provide important constraints on the msw and vacuum oscillation solutions for the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) . in the next paragraphs",
    "we will present a summary of the results presented in that conference together with initial analysis in the framework of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the most robust results of the solar neutrino experiments so far are the total observed rates .",
    "the most recent data on rates are summarized in table  ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "total rates alone indicate that the @xmath106 energy spectrum from the sun is distorted .",
    "the ssm flux predictions are inconsistent with the observed rates in solar neutrino experiments at approximately the 20@xmath112 level .",
    "furtherly , there is no linear combination of neutrino fluxes that can fit the available data at the 3@xmath112 level ( fig.([ssm1 ] ) ) .",
    ".neutrino event rates measured by solar neutrino experiments , and corresponding predictions from the ssm ( see ref.@xcite and references therein , we take the int normalization for the ssm data ( @xmath123 errors ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from a two - flavor analysis of the total event rates in the clar , sage , gallex and sk experiments the best @xmath124 fit considering active neutrino oscillations is obtained for @xmath125 ev@xmath126 ( the so called small mixing angle solution , sma ) .",
    "other local @xmath124 minima exist .",
    "the large mixing angle solution ( lma ) occurs at @xmath127 ev@xmath128 , the low solution ( lower probability , low mass ) , at @xmath129 ev@xmath130 .",
    "the vacuum oscillation solution occurs at @xmath131 ev@xmath132 . at this extremely low value for the mass difference",
    "the msw effect is inopperant .    for oscillations involving sterile neutrinos (",
    "the matter effective potential is modified in this case ) the lma and low solutions are not allowed and only the ( only slightly modified ) sma solution together with the vacuum solution are still possible .    more sophisticated analysis including more than two neutrino species are not available but they would not change so much the previous picture while introducing a much larger technical difficulty .",
    "analysis which consider neutrino oscillations in presence of magnetic fields , the rsfp effect , have also been presented . typically , they yield solutions with @xmath133 ev@xmath134 for both small and large mixing angles .",
    "rsfp solutions are much more ambiguous than pure msw solutions because of neccesity to introduce additional free parameters in order to model the largely unknown intensity and profile of solar magnetic fields .",
    "the recognition of the random nature of solar convective fields and recent theoretical developments in the treatment of schroedinger random equations have partially aliviated this situation , allowing the obtention of snp solutions without the neccesity of a detailed model description ( see recent analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , random rsfp models predict the production of a sizeable quantity of electron antineutrinos .",
    "presently , antineutrino searches with negative results in kamiokande and sk are welcome because restrict significantly the , uncomfortably large , parameter space of rsfp models . in the future such antineutrinos could be identified both in sk or in sno setting the majorana nature of the neutrino ( @xcite ) .",
    "if msw oscillations are effective , for a certain range of neutrino parameters the observed event rate will depend upon the zenith angle of the sun ( earth matter regeneration effect ) .",
    "after 504 days of data still , due to lack of statistics , the most robust estimator of zenith angle dependence by now is the day - night ( or up - down ) asymmetry , a. the experimental estimation is : @xmath135 the difference is small and not statistically significant but it is in the direction that would be expected from regeneration at earth ( the sun is apparently neutrino brighter at night ) .",
    "taken alone the small value observed for a excludes a large part of the parameter region that is allowed if only the total rates would be considered ( see fig.([solar1 ] ) ) .    from the independence from astrophysical causes ,",
    "the shape of the neutrino spectrum determines the shape of the recoil electron energy spectrum produced by neutrino - electron scattering in the detector .",
    "all the neutrino oscillation solutions ( sma , lma , low and vacuum ) provide acceptable , although indeed not excellent fits to the recoil energy spectrum .",
    "the simplest test is to investigate whether the ratio , r , of the observed to the standard energy spectrum is a constant .",
    "the fit of the ratio r to a linear function yields slope values which are incompatible at 99% cl with the hypothesis of no distortion ( see figs.([solar1]-[solar2 ] ) ) .    in the case",
    "where all data , the total rates , the zenith - angle dependence and the recoil energy spectrum , is combined the best - fit solution is almost identical to what is obtained for the rates only case . for other solutions , only the sma and vacuum solution survives ( at the 99% cl ) .",
    "the lma and the low solutions are , albeit marginally , ruled out @xcite .",
    "a small but significant discrepancy appears when comparing the predictions from the global best fits for the energy spectrum at high energies ( @xmath136 mev ) with the sk results presented in neutrino98  @xcite . from this discrepancy",
    "it has been speculated that hep neutrinos may affect the solar neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "presently low energy nuclear physics calculations of the rate of the hep reaction are highly uncertain ( a factor of six is allowed ) .",
    "coincidence between expected and measured ratios is improved when the hep flux is allowed to vary as a free parameter ( see fig.([solar6 ] ) ) .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are the decay products of hadronic showers produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the experimental ratio r @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the ratio of the numbers of @xmath64-like to @xmath139-like neutrino interactions observed in the data or predicted by the simulation has been measured as an estimator of the atmospheric neutrino flavor ratio @xmath140 the individual absolute neutrino flux calculation has a @xmath141 uncertainty .",
    "the flux ratio has been calculated however to an accuracy of better then @xmath142 in the range @xmath143 gev .",
    "the calculated flux ratio has a value of about 2 for energies @xmath144 1 gev and increases with increasing neutrino energy . for neutrino energies higher than a few gev",
    ", the fluxes of upward and downward going neutrinos are expected to be nearly equal ; geomagnetic field effects at these energies are expected to be small because of the relative large geomagnetic rigidity of the primary cosmic rays that produce these neutrinos .",
    "anomalous , statistically significant , low values of the ratio r has been obtained previously in the water cerenkov detectors kamiokande and imb-3 and the soudan-2 for `` sub - gev '' events ( e@xmath145 gev ) .",
    "the nusex and frejus experiments have reported results consistent with no deviation from unity with smaller data samples .",
    "kamiokande experiment observed a value of r smaller than unity in the multi - gev ( e@xmath1461 gev ) energy region as well as a dependence of this ratio on the zenith angle .",
    "imb-3 , with a smaller data sample , reported inconclusive results in a similar energy range but they are not in contradiction with kamiokande observations .",
    "superkamiokande ( sk ) recent results are completely consistent with previous results but they are more accurate than before .",
    "specially significant improvements in accuracy have been obtained in measuring the zenith angular dependence of the neutrino events .",
    "they see that the flux of muon neutrinos going up is smaller than that of downgoing neutrinos : in the sub - gev range ( @xmath147 gev ) , from an exposure of @xmath119 kiloton - years of the sk detector the measured ratio r is : @xmath148 it is not possible to determine from data , whether the observed deviation of r is due to an electron excess of a muon deficit .",
    "the distribution of r with momentum in the sub - gev range is consistent with a flat distribution within the statistical error as it happens with zenith angle distributions ( see right plots in fig.([atm8 ] ) ) . in the multi - gev range , it has been obtained ( for a similar exposure ) a ratio r which is slightly higher than at lower energies @xmath149 for e - like events , the data is apparently consistent with mc . for @xmath64-like events",
    "there is a clear discrepancy between measurement and simulation .",
    "a strong distortion in the shape of the @xmath64-like event zenith angle distribution was observed ( plots ( [ atm4]-[atm8 ] ) ) .",
    "the angular correlation between the neutrino direction and the produced charged lepton direction is much better at higher energies ( @xmath150 ) : the zenith angle distribution of leptons reflects rather accurately that of the neutrinos in this case .",
    "the ratio of the number of upward to downward @xmath64-like events was found to be @xmath151 while the expected value is practically one : @xmath152 the validity of the results has been tested by measuring the azimuth angle distribution of the incoming neutrinos , which is insensitive to a possible influence from neutrino oscillations .",
    "this shape agreed with mc predictions which were nearly flat .",
    "the most obvious solution to the observed discrepancy is @xmath153 flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "this fits well to the angular distribution , since there is a large difference in the neutrino path - length between upward - going ( @xmath154 km ) and downward - going ( @xmath155 km ) , a zenith angle dependence of r can be interpreted as evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "oscillation into sterile neutrinos , @xmath156 , is also a good explanation consistent with data .",
    "@xmath157 oscillations does not fit however so well , they would also conflict laboratory measurements ( chooz , figs.([fchooz]-[atm6 ] ) ) . apart from neutrino",
    "oscillation , no other consistent explanation has been proposed .",
    "evidence for oscillations equals evidence for non - zero neutrino mass within the standard neutrino theory .",
    "the allowed neutrino oscillation parameter regions obtained by kamiokande and sk from different analysis are shown in fig.([atm6 ] ) .",
    "the best fit is obtained for squared mass differences in the range @xmath158 ev@xmath134 , and very large mixing .",
    "unless there is no fine tuning , this suggests a neutrino mass of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "such a mass implies the neutrino energy density in the universe to be 0.001 of the critical density which is too small to have cosmological consequences .",
    "this is of course a very rough argument : specific models , however , may allow larger neutrino masses quite naturally .      from the individual analysis of the data available from neutrino experiments",
    ", it follows that there exist three different scales of neutrino mass squared differences and two different ranges of small and maximal mixing angles , namely : @xmath159 fortunely for the sake of simplicity the neutrino mass scale relevant for hdm is roughly similar to the lsnd one .",
    "the introduction of the former would not change any further conclusion .",
    "but for the same reason , the definitive refutation of lsnd results by karmen or future experiments does not help completely in simplifying the task of finding a consistent framework for all the neutrino phenomenology .",
    "any combination of experimental data which involves only of the two mass scales can be fitted within a three family scenario , but solving simultaneously the solar and atmospheric problems requires generally some unwelcome fine tuning of parameters at the @xmath61 level .",
    "the detailed analysis of ref.@xcite obtains for example that solutions with 3 neutrino families which are compatible with the results from sbl inclusive experiments , lsnd and solar neutrino experiments are possible .",
    "the problem arises when one add the results from chooz , which rule out large atmospheric @xmath160 transitions and zenith dependence from sk atmospheric data one comes to the neccesity of consideration of schemes with four massive neutrinos including a light sterile neutrino . among the numerous possibilities ,",
    "complete mass hierarchy of four neutrinos is not favored by existing data @xcite nor four - neutrino mass spectra with one neutrino mass separated from the group of the three close masses by the  lsnd gap  ( @xmath39 1 ) ev .",
    "one is left with two possible options where two double - folded groups of close masses are separated by a @xmath161 ev gap : @xmath162 & ( b)&\\ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{\\nu_e\\to \\nu_\\tau : \\ m_1 < m_2}^{sun } < < \\overbrace{\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_s:\\ m_3 < m_4}^{atm}}_{lsnd\\sim 1 ev}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the two models would be distinguishable from the detailed analysis of future solar and atmospheric experiments . for example they may be tested combining future precise",
    "recoil electron spectrum in @xmath163 measured in sk and sno @xcite with the sno spectrum measured in cc absorption .",
    "the sno experiment ( a 1000 t heavy water under - mine detector ) will measure the rates of the charged ( cc ) and neutral ( nc ) current reactions induced by solar neutrinos in deuterium : @xmath164 including the determination of the electron recoil energy in the cc reaction .",
    "only the more energetic @xmath118b solar neutrinos are expected to be detected since the expected sno threshold for cc events is an electron kinetic energy of about 5 mev and the physical threshold for nc dissociation is the binding energy of the deuteron , @xmath165 mev .",
    "if the ( b ) model it is true one expects @xmath166 while in the ( a ) model the ratio would be @xmath167 . the schemes ( a ) and ( b ) give different predictions for the neutrino mass measured in tritium @xmath75-decay and for the effective majorana mass observed in neutrinoless double @xmath75 decay .",
    "respectively we have @xmath168 ( a ) or @xmath169 ( b ) .",
    "thus , if scheme ( a ) is realized in nature this kind of experiments can see the effect of the lsnd neutrino mass .    from the classical lep requirement @xmath170 @xcite , it is clear that the fourth neutrino should be a @xmath171 singlet in order to ensure that does not affect the invisible z decay width .",
    "the presence of additional weakly interacting light particles , such as a light sterile @xmath172 , is constrained by bbn since it would enter into equilibrium with the active neutrinos via neutrino oscillations .",
    "the limit @xmath173 ev@xmath134 should be fulfilled in principle .",
    "however systematical uncertainties in the derivation of the bbn bound make any bound too unreliable to be taken at face value and can eventually be avoided @xcite .",
    "taking the most restrictive options ( giving @xmath174 ) only the ( a ) scheme is allowed , one where the sterile neutrino is mainly mixed with the electron neutrino . in the lest restrictive case ( @xmath175 ) both type of models would be allowed .",
    "the theoretical challenges that the present phenomenological situation offers are two at least : to understand origin and , very particularly , the lightness of the sterile neutrino ( apparently requiring a radiatively generated mass ) and to account for the maximal neutrino mixing indicated by the atmospheric data which is at odd from which one could expect from considerations of the mixing in the quark sector .",
    "actually , the existence of light sterile neutrinos could even be beneficial in diverse astrophysical and cosmological scenarios ( supernova nucleosynthesis , hot dark matter , lepton and baryon asymmetries for example ) .    in the last years different indications in favor of nonzero neutrino masses and mixing angles have been found .",
    "these evidences include four solar experiments clearly demonstrating an anomaly compared to the predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) and a number of other atmospheric experiments , including a high statistics , well calibrated one , demonstrating a quite different anomaly at the earth scale .",
    "one could argue that if we are already beyond the stage of having only  circumstantial evidence for new physics  , we are still however a long way from having  conclusive proof of new physics  .",
    "evidence for new physics does not mean the same as evidence for neutrino oscillations but there exists a significant case for neutrino oscillations and hence neutrino masses and mixing as  one  , indeed the most serious candidate , explanation of the data .",
    "one of the possible alternatives is that one or more of the experiments will turn out to be wrong .",
    "this is possible and even probable , but it is little probable that with all the evidence accumulated by now all the experiments turn out to be simultaneously wrong .",
    "many neutrino experiments are taking data , are going to start or are under preparation : solar neutrino experiments ( sno and borexino are of major interest , also heron , hellaz , icarus , gno and others ) ; lbl reactor ( chooz , palo verde , kamland ) and accelerator experiments ( k2k , minos , icarus and others ) ; sbl experiments ( lsnd , karmen , boone and many others ) . the important problem for any next generation experiment is to find specific and unambiguous experimental probe that the  anomalies  which has been found are indeed signals of neutrino oscillations and to distinguish among the different neutrino oscillation possibilities ( this is specially important in the solar case ) . among these probes",
    ", we could include :    * perhaps the most direct test of sm deviation : to measure the ratio of the flux of @xmath106 s ( via a cc interaction ) to the flux of neutrinos of all types ( @xmath176 , determined by nc interactions ) .",
    "this measurement will be done hopefully by the sno experiment in the near future .",
    "see fig.([fut3 ] ) .",
    "* statistically significant demonstration of an energy - dependent modification of the shape of the electron neutrino spectrum arriving at earth .",
    "besides observing distortion in the shape of @xmath118b neutrinos , it will be very important to make direct measurements of the @xmath117be ( borexino experiment ) and pp ( heron , hellaz ) neutrinos .",
    "* improved observation of a zenith angle effect in atmospheric experiments or their equivalent , a day - night effect in solar experiments . * and least , but by no means the least , independent confirmation by one or more accelerator experiments .",
    "there is a high probability that in the near future we should know much more than now about the fundamental properties of neutrinos and their masses , mixing and their own nature whether dirac or majorana .",
