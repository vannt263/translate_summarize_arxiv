    "merging and interacting are key elements in the life of galaxies , and underpin most current theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "there are probably very few galaxies today that were not shaped by interactions or even outright mergers .",
    "many mergers appear luminous in all wavebands .",
    "a very intense ( l@xmath2 ) and spatially extended burst of star formation occurs in the evolution of most mergers .",
    "toomre s ( 1977 ) hypothesis , whereby elliptical galaxies might be formed from the merger of two disk galaxies , is now generally accepted , such behaviour having been modelled in many n - body simulations of mergers ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes 1988 ) . during such an encounter , the conversion of orbital to internal energy causes the two progenitor disks to sink together and coalesce violently into a centrally condensed system .",
    "the ` toomre sequence ' ( toomre 1977 ) represents probably the best examples of nearby ongoing mergers , from disk - disk systems to near - elliptical remnants .",
    "ngc  520 ( arp 157 ) , the second brightest very disturbed galaxy in the sky ( arp 1987 ) lies seventh in the toomre sequence , and is classified as an intermediate - stage merger by hibbard & van gorkom ( 1996 ) , is as radio and infrared bright as the famous merging system the _ antennae _ , and has two smaller tails as well as two nuclei and two velocity systems in its spectra , indicative of a young merger .",
    "some properties of the system are given in table  1 .",
    "a distance to ngc520 of 28mpc is assumed in this paper ( read & ponman 1998 [ hereafter rp98 ] ; tully 1988 ) , hence 1  corresponds to @xmath38kpc .",
    "a brief introduction to the system is given below , and the previous x - ray observations are described in sec.1.1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparing the diffuse gas parameters in table  4 with those for isolated normal and starburst galaxies ( read , ponman & strickland 1997 ) , and for merging galaxies ( rp98 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2002 ; read 2003 ) , one can say that the single diffuse outflow observed in ngc520 is larger than the outflows seen in the earlier - stage _ mice _",
    "( @xmath4kpc ) , but is not as large as the the classic winds of m82 and ngc253 ( 9@xmath014kpc ) , nor quite as large as the outflowing , non - collimated turbulent ism of the antennae ( @xmath58kpc ) .",
    "there appears to be more diffuse gas within the ngc520 system than in the _ mice _ , but this gas mass , while possibly comparable to that of ngc253 and of order a half that seen in m82 , is only 10 - 20% of that seen in the _",
    "antennae_.    the injection rate of mechanical energy , or power injected into a particular galaxy by supernovae , can be estimated by the method employed in read & ponman ( 1995 ) , and this value for ngc520 is seen to be very similar to that of the _ antennae _ and m82 . the amount of hot gas in ngc520 , expressed as a fraction of input energy therefore , is rather small .",
    "note that , as the diffuse gas has a very long cooling time , no significant fraction of the gas has had time to cool .",
    "though it is believed that the hot ism of starburst galaxies has a multi - temperature structure , the single temperature obtained from the spectral fitting of the diffuse spectrum ( @xmath50.58kev ) is entirely consistent with the range obtained for other starburst and merging galaxies .",
    "ngc520 is very far - infrared bright , and consequently has a large value of @xmath6 .",
    "it also has a large far - infrared temperature , @xmath7 , and both these are indicative of ngc520 having a high sfr and being very active , more active than the famous interacting systems the _ mice _ and the",
    "_ antennae_.    the total emitted 0.2@xmath010kev x - ray luminosity of ngc520 , assuming a distance of 28mpc is 4.74@xmath8erg s@xmath9 , of which the diffuse emission makes up 13.5% ( the equivalent intrinsic absorption - corrected values are 7.64@xmath8erg s@xmath9 and @xmath10% ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 quoted here may initially appear at odds with the low value ( @xmath51@xmath8erg s@xmath12 ) given in rp98 .",
    "there a few points here to note : the energy bands over which the luminosities are calculated are different .",
    "the rp98 value is based on the results of spectrally fitting the pspc data , and this analysis was prone to difficulties and the spectral parameters obtained had large errors .",
    "in actuality , using pimms to predict the chandra acis - s count rate , based purely on the hri count - rate , allowing for the different energy ranges , and using a much more appropriate spectral model ( a @xmath131.5 power - law ) does give a similar result to what we actually observe with the acis - s ( to within 2% ) .",
    "lastly , there is quite evidently a lot of variability going on within the point sources , so we should expect some variation in @xmath11 between the observations .    as such",
    ", the larger x - ray luminosity inferred here for ngc520 , indicates that it is not as anomalous as was first thought in rp98 @xmath0 both its position in the @xmath11@xmath0@xmath14 plane ( rp98 fig.14 ) and its position in the @xmath15-versus - age plane ( rp98 fig.13 ) appear closer in line with the other similar - stage mergers than as depicted in rp98 .",
    "however , while taking into account the points raised in the previous paragraph , ngc520 still appears somewhat underluminous in x - rays , for its merger stage , perhaps by a factor of up to 2 .",
    "yun & hibbard ( 2001 ) discovered that , though a dense concentration of molecular gas is seen at the primary ( se ) nucleus , none is seen at the secondary ( nw ) nucleus , nor along the region bridging the two nuclei .",
    "hibbard & van gorkom s ( 1996 ) analysis of the stellar and hi  features in ngc520 indicated that ngc520 is the product of an encounter between a gas - rich disk and a gas - poor disk ( e.g.  an s0 and sa galaxy ) .",
    "the absence here of molecular gas in the nw nucleus can be explained if little molecular gas had been compressed towards the nucleus during the merger process , there being little gas in the progenitor disk to start with .",
    "similar analyses have concluded that systems such as the _ mice _ and the _ antennae _ are each the product of encounters between two gas - rich systems .",
    "this initial lack of gas in the nw progenitor is a very likely explanation of several facets of the x - ray emission discussed here . that there was no gas in the disk meant that no gas could be funnelled towards the nw nucleus during the interaction .",
    "consequently , little in the way of a starburst could take place at the nw nucleus , and no collections of supernovae could collect and expand outwards in the form of a starburst - driven wind or of fountains or chimneys etc .. @xmath0 there would be , as is observed , no diffuse x - ray emission surrounding the nw nucleus .",
    "the percentage of the total x - ray emission in ngc520 observed to be diffuse ( @xmath16 ) is low ( @xmath17% ) , when compared with roughly similar stage systems ( e.g.the antennae [ 45% ] ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2002 ) , and even when compared with very early - stage interacting systems ( e.g.  arp270 [ 29% ] ; brassington et al .  2004 ) .",
    "were the progenitor disk that formed the nw nucleus initially gas - rich , then @xmath16 for ngc520 would certainly be larger ( though not by a factor of two ) , and perhaps more in line with other merging systems .",
    "further , as discussed earlier , the number of ulxs observed is very low when compared to other mergers .",
    "it is well known ( e.g.  roberts et al.2002 ) that ulxs are more prevalent in regions of enhanced star - formation .",
    "if a starburst were to have occurred in the nw nucleus similar to that in the se nucleus , then the number of ulxs within the ngc520 system may well have been more like that of similar merger systems .",
    "lastly , the arguments raised here could increase the total x - ray luminosity , perhaps by the factor of @xmath32 required , bringing ngc520 more in - line with its expected position in the x - ray evolution of merging galaxies .",
    "presented here are high spatial and spectral resolution chandra acis - s x - ray observations of the interacting galaxy system , ngc520 , a system at a similar or slightly later evolutionary stage as the _ antennae _ , i.e.  more evolved than the _ mice _ but not as evolved as the ultraluminous contact mergers , such as arp220 .",
    "the primary results can be summarised as follows :    * what appears to possibly be a starburst - driven galactic wind has been discovered , outflowing perpendicular to the molecular disk surrounding the primary , optically - obscured se nucleus .",
    "no such structure , nor any significant diffuse feature of any kind is visible elsewhere in the system , and is notably absent from around the secondary nw nucleus .",
    "fitting of this diffuse emission yields a temperature entirely consistent with well - known nearby galactic winds . in terms of extent and mass",
    ", the wind appears larger and more massive than the winds of earlier - stage mergers , but is only at most of order the size and mass of the winds seen in the smaller nearby starbursts , and is rather much smaller and less massive than the diffuse structure seen in e.g.  the _ antennae _ ( a structure that appears more like a non - collimated outflow originating from the galaxy - wide star - formation , rather than a galactic wind - type outflow ) .",
    "one might have expected the ngc520 wind structures to distort very quickly , due to the rapid evolution and violence of the environment . however , the structure appears , especially towards the centre , to be rather classical in nature , and a single starburst - produced wind might indeed last intact for some time during a major interaction . *",
    "15 x - ray sources are detected within the optical confines of the system .",
    "of these , 3 or possibly 4 are ulxs , each with @xmath11 ( 0.2@xmath010kev ) @xmath18erg s@xmath9 .",
    "one of the ulxs lies at the primary nucleus , at the centre of the diffuse wind structure , and coincident with the bright radio source at the centre of the molecular disk .",
    "a number of the other bright sources are seen to lie near the edge of this molecular disk , in an interface region between the progenitor - galaxy - driven centrally - located neutral ism and the merger - driven outlying ionised ism .",
    "significantly , no sources are detected at the secondary nucleus , though within the system , much apparent point - source variability is seen between the observations described here and earlier _ rosat _ observations . *",
    "the slope of the source x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) is very flat , due predominantly to the ulxs , and appears in sharp contrast to that of other normal and starburst galaxies .",
    "it is however , similar to that of the _ antennae _ and other merging galaxies .",
    "* there is much in the x - ray data to support the idea , as suggested by previous multi - wavelength studies , that ngc520 is the result of an encounter between one gas - rich disk and one gas - poor disk : the number of ulxs observed is only 3@xmath04 , while one would expect , on the basis of the fir luminosity , a number closer to 10 .",
    "similarly , @xmath19 is lower than would be expected , based on the @xmath20 value .",
    "no sources are seen coincident with the secondary ( nw ) nucleus , nor is any diffuse emission observed in or around this nucleus .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity compared to other multiwavelength luminosities , and the diffuse gas fraction are down by about a factor of 2 , based on what would be expected , given ngc520 s evolutionary merger stage .",
    "it does seem therefore , that , in terms of the x - ray properties , because of the fact that ngc520 s progenitors are likely only one gas - rich disk plus one gas - poor disk , we are observing only half a merger when compared with similar gas - rich@xmath0gas - rich merger systems , such as the _ antennae _ and the _ mice_.",
