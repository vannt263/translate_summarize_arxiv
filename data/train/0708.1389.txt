    "granular ratcheting refers to the slow , linear accumulation of strain in a granular sample under cyclic loading .",
    "several versions of this phenomena have been identified .",
    "the first variant to be found occurs when the loaded sample reaches the critical state once per cycle .",
    "the mechanism is easily understood : the material flows while it is in the critical state , giving rise to a deformation that accumulates with cycle number . however , ratcheting can also appear even when the sample never reaches the critical state @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss exclusively this second type of ratcheting .    ratcheting in the absence of a critical state",
    "has also been observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this is a very promising development , for one has access to all the quantities in numerical simulations , and it is usually possible to identify the origin of the phenomena .",
    "once this has been done , one can then ask if the cause of the phenomena in the simulations is related to the cause in the experiments .",
    "numerical studies have already provided many clues to granular ratcheting .",
    "the important role of sliding contacts has been pointed out @xcite , granular ratcheting has been delimited from other possible behaviors @xcite , and the influence of various parameters has been studied @xcite .",
    "one finding of these studies is that granular ratcheting is a quasi - static phenomena .",
    "specifically , if one lets the frequency of the oscillating force tend to zero while keeping all other parameters the same , the deformation per cycle approaches a constant .",
    "what is still missing is an understanding of granular ratcheting on the micro - mechanical level : how exactly does the phenomenon arise from interaction of individual particles ?",
    "is it possible to modify the particle interaction law to eliminate ratcheting ?",
    "what is the simplest system needed to produce ratcheting ?",
    "we answer these questions in this paper .    in sec .",
    "[ ratchet16 ] we show that ratcheting can be obtained with only 16 particles . ratcheting occurs if a single contact becomes sliding .",
    "previously , ratcheting was linked to the presence of sliding contacts , but this is the first time that it is shown that only a single contact is necessary . we also show that the application of unconventional boundary conditions can lead to ratcheting even when there are no sliding contacts . in sec .  [ origin ] , we show how granular ratcheting arises from the way tangential forces are calculated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : amd ] we present an alternative method that does not exhibit ratcheting .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we show how stiffness matrix theory can illuminate some aspects of the problem .",
    "in this section , we present a very brief description of granular ratcheting , since more complete discussions already exist @xcite .",
    "granular ratcheting is observed in biaxial or triaxial tests , where a granular sample is enclosed in a test chamber , and subjected to a uniform pressure and a cyclic load .",
    "we consider here exclusively the two dimensional version of these experiments , often called the `` biaxial box '' , where a granular sample composed of disks is enclosed in a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath0 , with forces @xmath1 and @xmath2 exerted on the walls .",

    "one usually uses deviatoric strain @xmath7 to characterize the deformation .",
    "( here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lengths of the system at the beginning of the simulation . )",
    "we use a common numerical model of granular materials : grains are represented by disks who repel each other when they overlap .",
    "thus whenever two disks touch each other , they exert a repulsive force @xmath10 at the point of contact , directed normal to the particle surfaces .",
    "@xmath10 is an increasing function of the overlap @xmath11 .",
    "if the surfaces of two touching disks move relative to each other in the tangential direction , a second force @xmath12 arises , directed tangent to the particle surfaces .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath12 are called the normal and tangential components of the contact force .",
    "in addition to these forces , some damping forces are included to remove energy injected by the loading .",
    "the contact force is subjected to two constraints , namely @xmath13 the first condition excludes cohesion , and the second is the coulomb friction law .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is the coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "contacts where @xmath15 are called sliding contacts , and those where @xmath16 are called non - sliding .",
    "all studies of granular ratcheting use this model , except sometimes polygons are used instead of disks @xcite .",
    "if one wishes to approximate the continuum - like behavior of soils , simulations with large numbers of particles are necessary .",
    "therefore , granular ratcheting has been studied in assemblies of hundreds or thousands of particles . in this paper , however , we wish simply to discover the origin of the phenomena , so it is useful to consider small numbers of particles . in this section",
    ", we study an assembly of sixteen particles that exhibits granular ratcheting .",
    "the normal force is taken to be proportional to the overlap area , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ stress - strain ] we show a plot of @xmath17 vs @xmath18 for a biaxial test performed on sixteen circular particles . in the first cycle , @xmath17 increases to about @xmath19 . during subsequent cycles",
    ", the system appears to trace out a four - sided polygon in the @xmath18-@xmath17 plane .",

    "this is granular ratcheting .    during one cycle ,",
    "all the contacts remain non - sliding , except for one , which becomes sliding twice per cycle .",
    "this single contact is responsible for granular ratcheting , for if we inhibit sliding at this contact by increasing @xmath14 , granular ratcheting stops .",

    "( [ contactconditions ] ) mean that @xmath23 must always lie within this cone . as one can see , the ratcheting contact s trajectory is a trapezoid , with the four corners labeled @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the two parallel line segments correspond to the change in force when all contacts are non - sliding .",
    "line segments @xmath28 and @xmath29 lie on the sides of the cone @xmath15 , and correspond to times when the contact is sliding with @xmath30 or @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the trajectory is not quite a trapezoid , because after one cycle , the point does not return to @xmath24 , but arrives at @xmath32 , a bit closer to the origin than , but very close to , @xmath24 . after the following cycle",
    ", the system has again shifted towards the origin by the same amount .",
    "this shift has its origin in the tiny displacement that occurs with each cycle - the sliding contact is gradually opening .",
    "the non - sliding contacts in the packing also trace out trapezoids , but their edges do not intersect the cone @xmath15 .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",

    "also yields an ellipse proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contact_ell ] .",
    "this suggests that ratcheting is related to the area enclosed by trajectories in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "ratcheting with small numbers of particles has another distinguishing property : the strain accumulation can be either positive or negative .",

    "( [ imposed ] ) , the average imposed force does _ not _ correspond to an isotropic pressure , because @xmath45 .",
    "the pressure exerted by the walls on the top and bottom of the sample are larger than at the side walls .",

    "the range of @xmath17 observed is also much smaller than for @xmath37 particles .",

    "previous studies of granular ratcheting always considered large numbers of particles , so this was never noticed .",

    "[ fig : cmdcompare ] and [ fig : cmddt ] . the others exhibit a variety of other behaviors that will be discussed in the next section .",
    "once ratcheting has been removed or reduced , new behaviors come to the foreground .",
    "the most common of these are outliers .",
    "the strain is independent of cycle number , except for occasional cycles .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] .",
    "a closer inspection of these simulations reveals that these outliers are due to `` rattlers '' : particles without contacts .",
    "since there is no gravity , rattlers float inside cages in the packing .",
    "occasionally , they collide with walls of their cage .",
    "these collisions coincide with the outlying points .",
    "once the collision is past , the packing returns to its initial state , and the rattler floats off toward another part of its cage .",
    "the packing that produced fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outlier_config ] .",
    "the rattler is found in the upper center of the packing .",
    "it moves within a cage formed by five particles and the upper wall .",
    "the outlying points in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] coincide with collisions between the rattler and its cage .",
    "however , not all collisions leave a trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] ; the amplitude registered in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] probably strongly depends on the time within the cycle where the collision takes place .     versus cycle number for a simulation performed with the angle based method of calculating tangential forces .",
    "the strain is periodic .",
    "this arises when the rattler is confined in a very small cage.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the frequency of collisions with the cage can vary widely .",
    "sometimes only one point out of @xmath173 is perturbed . in other cases ,",
    "every point can be considered as an outlier .",
    "another thing that can happen when the rattler s cage is small is that it can be driven in the cage by the motion of the surrouding particles in a periodic way .",
    "this leads to a periodic dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath161 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodic ] .",
    "rattler - induced outliers exist also in the original cundall and strack method .",
    "when on inspects the @xmath160 non - ratcheting simulations , one finds that @xmath52 of them have perturbations due to rattlers .",
    "another effect that rattlers can cause is a sudden step in the strain .",
    "this occurs when the particles forming the cage have only weak contact forces .",
    "the rattler can induce a sudden step in the strain by provoking a small re - arrangement of these particles .    one way to reduce the effect of the rattlers",
    "is to apply a weak gravitational field so that they can no longer float slowly from one side of their cage to another .",
    "when this is done , outliers still exist , but the perturbations they introduce are much smaller ",
    "@xmath174 instead of @xmath175 .",
    "another phenomenon is `` shakedown '' , which has already been investigated @xcite . in `` shakedown ''",
    ", the accumulated strain per cycle decreases each cycle . in fig.[fig : shakedown ] , we show an example .",
    "the time required to reach a level of negligible strain accumulation is variable . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shakedown ] , strain is still accumulating , even after @xmath176 cycles .",
    "in other simulations , shakedown occurs after very few simulations .     versus cycle number for a simulation performed with the angle based method of calculating tangential forces .",
    "this sample exhibits shake down.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      to study these phenomena in larger systems , a series of @xmath52 simulations with @xmath53 particles was carried out . with the original cundall ",
    "strack method , ratcheting is observed , with a much narrower range of strain accumulation , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : strainsign ] .",
    "when either of the modifications proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : amd ] is used , outliers dominate the stress - cycle graphs .",
    "this is probably because as the packing becomes large , the probability of having a rattler approaches unity .",
    "when a weak gravitational field is applied , the phenomena of `` shakedown '' dominates .",
    "we have uncovered the cause of granular ratcheting .",
    "it is due to a potential energy that depends not only on the particle positions , but also on their past trajectories . as a granular assembly",
    "is subjected to cyclic loading , it is impossible to return both the particle positions and the contact forces to their initial values , so a small deformation occurs with each cycle .",
    "it follows that granular ratcheting can be eliminated by defining a potential energy depending only on the current particle positions .",
    "this was confirmed by extensive numerical simulations using two different implementations of this idea .",
    "this result suggests that contact modeling should focus on the potential energy as the fundamental quantity , and then use eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqmotion ] ) to obtain the forces .",
    "in contrast , the most common approach taken in the literature is to directly postulate forces based on physical grounds , without considering the potential energy .",
    "one possible criticism of this work is that it is only concerned with disks , whereas ratcheting has been found in packings of polygons .",
    "the motion of disks is much simper to analyze , because the rotation of the disks is uncoupled from the translation . in polygons , this is no longer true .",
    "but all that is required is that the potential energy be path dependent .",
    "one common force law , used in granular ratcheting studies @xcite is to assume that the force between polygons is proportional to the overlap area .",
    "this force law has been shown to violate energy conservation @xcite .",
    "thus it seems likely that the explanation of granular ratcheting presented here also applies to ratcheting of packings of polygons .    at a detailed level",
    ", the numerical mechanism can not be the same as the physical one .",
    "numerical granular ratcheting is a consequence of the way the tangential spring is stretched . in experiments ,",
    "the contacts between the particles are not governed by the stretching of springs . indeed ,",
    "if two touching particles can be considered as making up a single elastic body , then force and position cycles will coincide , as there is a potential energy .",
    "however , the results of this paper do show that granular ratcheting in the experiments will occur if force and position cycles are not equal . in principle , this could be checked by examining a single contact under cyclic loading . such an experiment would be difficult to do , since very small relative displacements must be measured . and it must also be mentioned that the idea of two contacting particles acting as if they were welded together at the contact surface is itself an idealization",
    ". there may be zones of slip at the contact ( even when the contact as a whole does not slide ) , and this may give rise to a complicated behavior when the contact is subjected to cyclic loading . another possibility is that fluid could coat the surfaces of the touching particles , possibly lubricating them . or abrasion at the contact point could generate very tiny particles trapped between the two touching surfaces",
    ". these particles could act like fault gouge @xcite on a very small scale , facilitating a relative tangential motion .",
    "all of these effects may lead to a history dependent potential energy , and thus to granular ratcheting through the mechanism discussed in this paper .",

    "the section presents a very brief review of stiffness matrix theory .",
    "this theory applies to granular packings under quasi - static loading , and thus is applicable to granular ratcheting .",

    "( [ imposed ] ) , * why this is no longer true when there are sliding contacts , and * why the forcing given in eq .",
    "( [ 2dforcing ] ) generates particle trajectories with a non - zero area .      in stiffness matrix theory @xcite ,",
    "the behavior of the packing is piece - wise linear .",
    "thus time can be divided into intervals @xmath177 $ ] during which the velocities of the particles are linearly related to the change in forces : @xmath178 where @xmath179 represents the external forces ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the biaxial box ) , @xmath180 contains the velocities of the particles and walls , and @xmath181 is called the _",
    "stiffness matrix_. it relates the velocities ( or displacement increments ) of the particles to the change in the force exerted on each particle by its neighbors .",
    "the motion is only _ piece - wise _ linear because the stiffness matrix @xmath181 depends on the status ( sliding or not ) of each contact .",
    "whenever a contact status changes , @xmath181 also changes .",
    "therefore , the times @xmath182 which define the intervals of linearity are the times when one or more contacts change status .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) holds when the forcing is quasi - static , and the particles are quasi - rigid .",
    "quasi - static forcing means that the time scale associated with the forcing is much longer than the time the packing needs to react .",
    "particles can be said to be quasi - rigid if their stiffness is much greater than the confining pressure .",
    "note that these two assumptions are related : if the particles are very stiff , the speed of sound is very high , and the packing can quickly react to changes in the external load .      if one considers a biaxial test , with the forcing given by eq .",
    "( [ imposed ] ) , then only the entries of @xmath183 corresponding to the walls are non - zero , because no external forces are applied to the particles . furthermore , in eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) , only those components associated with varying forces survive differentiation by time .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) becomes @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a vector , all of whose components are zero , except the @xmath186 component of the force on the upper and lower walls .",
    "all other components of @xmath179 are either zero or constant .",
    "one would like to invert @xmath181 and bring it onto the left hand side of the equation .",
    "but @xmath181 is singular because there are certain collective motions that do not change the spring lengths , and hence do not change the forces .",
    "one example is the uniform motion of all particles .",
    "they do not move relative to one other , and provoke no change in force .",
    "let @xmath187 be the set of all such motions .",
    "we can be sure that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ biaxialstiffness ] ) is orthogonal to every member of @xmath187 , for if it were not , the packing would be unstable @xcite .",

    "let @xmath193 be the range of @xmath181 . then",
    ": @xmath194 this determines @xmath188 .",
    "note that @xmath195 is a projector that removes @xmath187 .    using this in eq .",
    "( [ biaxialstiffness ] ) , one can write : @xmath196 which can be integrated : @xmath197 here @xmath198 is a vector containing the positions of the particles and walls .",
    "( [ eq : positions ] shows that the position of each particle moves back and forth on a line defined by the appropriate components of @xmath199 .",
    "so no area is traced out by position cycles , and ratcheting does not occur .",
    "but if there are sliding contacts , then @xmath181 does not remain constant .",
    "recall that @xmath181 changes whenever a contact changes status .",
    "thus when a contact starts or stops sliding , the relation between @xmath180 and @xmath179 changes , and the particle motion changes direction .",
