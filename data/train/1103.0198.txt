    "nonetheless , we do not try to prove systematically the estimates stated later in ",
    "[ sec : dispersion ] for these less regular potentials .",
    "we refer to the appendix in @xcite about the existence of double well potentials satisfying ( h1)(h5 ) , as well as to the brief computational discussion in appendix [ sec : num ] . specifically , if one starts with an even potential @xmath25 such that @xmath26 admits exactly one eigenvalue @xmath27 , then setting @xmath28 for @xmath29 yields potentials with two eigenvalues , both very close to @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath30 a normalized ground state for @xmath26 , then @xmath31 then , @xmath32 because they are all about @xmath33 originally , results of this nature appeared in the work of e. harrell @xcite .",
    "the equations with @xmath34 for @xmath29 are the focus of recent research @xcite because of the rich patterns detected at small energies .",
    "the references @xcite both treat with @xmath35 replaced by a cubic nonlinearity ( which for our purposes is a difficult problem due to the subcritical nature of the nonlinearity ) .",
    "the result in @xcite proves the existence of a family of nonlinear ground states @xmath36 of that bifurcate out of the linear ground state @xmath37 . for @xmath38 close to @xmath39",
    "the @xmath36 are orbitally stable , see  [ subsec : stability ] , and even in @xmath10 . at some critical @xmath40 the ground states bifurcate for @xmath41 in two families , one formed by even functions , which are unstable , and the other formed by non symmetric functions , which are stable .",
    "the arguments in @xcite are quite general , but here we double check that this behavior continues to hold also in the case of the quintic nls .    in @xcite , the existence of more complex long time patterns",
    "is analyzed by studying the dynamics of a simplified finite dimensional system , obtained by selecting a finite number of variables of the nls in an appropriate system of coordinates . over long times",
    "it is shown to be a good approximation of the full nls .",
    "in particular , this finite dimensional approximation of the nls admits a larger class of time periodic solutions than just the standing waves .",
    "the question then becomes whether or not these new periodic solutions persist also for the full nls equation .",
    "in @xcite it is conjectured they do not persist . in this paper",
    "we do not address the solutions considered in @xcite , but nonetheless for an easier problem we provide the mechanism by which the full nls disrupts periodic solutions of a simplified system similar to that in @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : fd ] however , we will present evidence that indeed similar dynamical solutions exist that would collapse via the asymptotic stability analysis presented here to a nonlinear bound state asymptotically .",
    "such dynamics have been abstractly studied in @xcite as well .",
    "we recall that @xcite simplifies the nls by first choosing as system of coordinates the spectral decomposition of @xmath42 , and by then setting equal to @xmath4 the continuous components . here , we consider instead a natural representation of the portion of @xmath43 near the surface of asymmetric ground states .",
    "there are then natural finite dimensional approximations of the nls admitting periodic solutions .",
    "they are as legitimate approximate solutions of the nls as those in @xcite , although here we do not try to check as in @xcite if they are good approximate solutions .",
    "our solutions are relatively easy because they live arbitrarily close to the surface of asymmetric ground states .",
    "when the full nls is turned on , these approximate periodic solutions do not persist because the ground states are asymptotically stable .",
    "hence the periodic solutions of the simplified system , now split into a part converging in @xmath44 to the orbit of a ground state , and another part which scatters like free radiation ( see theorem [ thm : as stab ] ) .",
    "this part of the paper fits easily in the framework of the literature of asymptotic stability of ground states initiated in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the most general results are in @xcite , which contains a quite general proof of the so called fermi golden rule . in the present paper",
    "though , we treat a quite special situation , due to the hypothesis that @xmath45 consists of just two eigenvalues , and so it is enough to use the simpler framework of @xcite ( we recall that @xcite is a revision and a simplification of @xcite , which contains various mistakes ) . to address the solutions in @xcite one",
    "can probably proceed similarly , though the complexity of the dynamical systems studied and the cubic nonlinearity makes the analysis rather challenging .",
    "the difficulty though , is that the solutions in @xcite , while of arbitrarily small energy , might nonetheless not be sufficiently close to ground states .",
    "the issues then seem in some sense more `` global '' , and closer in spirit to the problems addressed in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we consider nonlinear ground states of the form @xmath46 applying the machinery of @xcite , we prove that there is an @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , such that for @xmath49 $ ] there is a uniquely defined map @xmath50 in @xmath51 , h^{k , s}({{\\mathbb r}}))$ ] for any @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for @xmath41 there is a bifurcation , with a branch of even ground states , and a branch of asymmetric ground states .",
    "we focus on the latter ones .",
    "we then prove the following    [ thm : as stab ] there is a @xmath54 such that for any @xmath55 there exist an @xmath56 and a @xmath57 such that if @xmath58 there exist @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 such that @xmath63 it is possible to write @xmath64 with @xmath65 for any @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , and such that the following strichartz estimates are satisfied : @xmath69    once the necessary spectral hypotheses in @xcite are proved in section [ sec : discspec ] , theorem [ thm : as stab ] is a direct consequence of @xcite .",
    "nonetheless we give a sketch of the main steps in the proof .",
    "in particular we review in section [ sec : dispersion ] the material on dispersion of linear operators needed in the proof . here",
    "we recall that the absence of the endpoint strichartz estimate on @xmath70 requires some surrogates .",
    "the surrogates were found by mizumachi @xcite .",
    "however it turns out that @xcite can be substantially simplified , and that the smoothing estimates contained in @xcite , while interesting per se , are not necessary in the proof of the main result in @xcite . in fact",
    "the classical smoothing estimates introduced by kato in @xcite are sufficient .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite and is reviewed in section [ sec : dispersion ] .",
    "see also the recent results of @xcite to allow singular potentials in our analysis with restrictions to @xmath71 .",
    "as in @xcite we consider ground states of the form @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 in @xmath77 and for @xmath78 a real valued function belonging to @xmath79 for any @xmath52 with @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "we are looking for the simplest asymmetric ground states possible and not for all possible nonlinear ground states branching out of the linear ground state .",
    "we denote by @xmath82 the projection to the continuous spectral component of @xmath83 .",
    "hence we look at the system @xmath84 by an elementary application of the implicit function theorem one obtains the following    [ lem : eta ] for @xmath75 and @xmath76 sufficiently small , the third equation admits a unique solution @xmath85 which depends smoothly in @xmath86 with values in @xmath79 for any @xmath52 and can be expressed as @xmath87 where @xmath88 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lem : eta ] is a standard application of the impicit function theorem and a resolvent identity .",

    "for @xmath98 one can see that the third term in the lhs of the second equation in is @xmath4 , because it is @xmath99 , which vanishes since the integrand is an odd function .",
    "so the second equation in is trivial . substituting @xmath100 in the first , and factoring out a common factor @xmath75",
    ", we get @xmath101 by the implicit function theorem we can solve with respect to @xmath72 getting @xmath102    [ lem : nearbranch ] there is a number @xmath103 , with @xmath104 such that at @xmath105 the function of lemma [ lem : near ] satisfies also the equation @xmath106    equation is , for @xmath107 , equivalent to @xmath108 where we have used . by the implicit function theorem",
    "the last equation has exactly one solution @xmath109    at @xmath110 and at the corresponding value @xmath111 , the family of even ground states which we have found above , bifurcates in two families , one formed by even ground states and the other by asymmetric ground states . in the context of the cubic nls ,",
    "@xcite proves that for @xmath112 the even ground states are unstable while the asymmetric ground states are orbitally stable . in the rest of  2 we double check that asymmetric ground states have the same behavior of @xcite for our quintic nls",
    "following @xcite we consider the branch of asymmetric ground states defined for @xmath114 set @xmath115 we know that @xmath116 .",
    "hence , we apply the implicit function theorem and prove the following    [ lem : asymm ] the jacobian @xmath117 has rank 2 at @xmath118 .",
    "correspondingly , by the implicit function theorem there are smooth functions @xmath119 and @xmath120 such that @xmath121 which are defined for @xmath76 in a small neighborhood of 0 and such that @xmath122 we have @xmath123    we have @xmath124 for @xmath98 and @xmath93 ( see ) , we get @xmath125 we have @xmath126 for @xmath98 , we get @xmath127 for @xmath98 we already know from that @xmath128",
    "so , @xmath129 then the jacobian matrix @xmath117 at @xmath130 is @xmath131 with inverse matrix @xmath132 we see below that @xmath133 at @xmath98 .",
    "this implies immediately @xmath134 we have @xmath135 where the last equality is due to the fact that @xmath136 is odd and the other factors are even .",
    "we have @xmath137 to show that @xmath138 and compute @xmath139 , we use the elementary fact that for two smooth functions @xmath140 we have @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . hence , calculating as above , @xmath144 with the last equality due to the fact that we are integrating an odd function .",
