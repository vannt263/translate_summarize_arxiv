    "the historical discovery of neutrino oscillations constitutes the only indication of physics beyond the standard model . in the absence of a basic understanding of fermion masses and mixings",
    ", it is natural to seek simplified patterns in the mixing matrix which are consistent with the present experimental knowledge and provide guidance for the future experimental searches .",
    "such phenomenological patterns are , at best , first approximations to the experimental data and the next step is to study deviations from these patterns .",
    "a successful phenomenological ansatz for neutrino mixing matrix which is consistent with the present neutrino data @xcite was proposed by harrison , perkins and scott @xcite and is given by @xmath1 in this mixing scheme , the second neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath0 has trimaximal character as it arises from maximal mixing of the three flavor eigenstates ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "moreover , the third mass eigenstate @xmath5 has bimaximal character as it results from maximal mixing of two flavor eigenstates _ viz . _",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence , this mixing scheme is called tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing and gives vanishing @xmath6 and maximal @xmath7 . the mixing angle",
    "@xmath6 vanishes in tbm mixing because of bimaximal character of @xmath5 , a feature needs to be abandoned in order to allow for a non - vanishing @xmath6 and , hence , the possibility of cp violation .",
    "however , there is no need to abandon the trimaximal character of the @xmath0 in this generalization of tbm mixing .",
    "such a mixing matrix , called trimaximal ( tm ) @xcite , will be of the form @xmath8 where the first and third columns are subject solely to unitarity constraints and the middle column has trimaximal character .",
    "the definition of trimaximality adopted here requires that magnitudes and phases of all the three elements in the middle column of the mixing matrix are equal .",
    "the common phase of the middle column can be rephased away by phase - redefinition of the lepton fields .",
    "the relationship between tbm mixing and tm mixing needs also to be understood from the standpoint of the symmetry groups associated with these mixing schemes .",
    "the tm mixing follows from a neutrino mass matrix which can be parametrized as @xmath9 in terms of four complex parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 having @xmath14 symmetry in the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal @xcite . the matrix is called magic mass matrix since its rows and columns all add up to @xmath15 and hence one of its eigenvectors is @xmath16 within an overall multiplicative phase @xcite .",
    "the above mass matrix becomes @xmath17-@xmath18 symmetric as well if the number of free parameters are reduced to three by demanding @xmath19 .",
    "the mixing matrix become tbm and the symmetry group enlarges to @xmath20 after making the above fine tuning .",
    "thus , the neutrino mass matrix having @xmath14 symmetry and bringing about tm mixing contains one more complex parameter than the mass matrix having @xmath20 symmetry and producing tbm mixing which can be used to accommodate a non - vanishing @xmath6 and a dirac - type cp - violating phase @xmath21 .",
    "this additional parameter needs to be fine tuned to recover the tbm mixing in a mass model based upon @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix will be tm in absence of any such fine tuning of parameters @xcite .",
    "it becomes imperative to analyse the phenomenology of tm mixing scheme in this context .",
    "the cp violating structure in trimaximal mixing is an interesting feature to study because of the mathematical restriction that one of the eigenvector of the mass matrix be @xmath22 which severely restricts the elements of the matrix to coordinate in a way so that they produce a real eigenvector .",
    "this coordination results into a unique correlation between cp violation and the mixing angles .",
    "a notion of maximal cp violation automatically emerges when unitarity constraints are combined with trimaximality .",
    "the jarlskog rephasing invariant @xmath23 @xcite takes its maximal value @xmath24 when @xmath7 is maximal .",
    "similarly , the deviation from maximal 2 - 3 mixing is proportional to @xmath6 and is naturally restricted to lie within the present experimental range by unitarity for values of @xmath6 within its experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "this deviation is zero when cp violation is maximal and is maximal when there is no cp violation .",
    "trimaximality , as defined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , equates magnitudes as well as phases of the three elements of the middle column of @xmath25 .",
    "although , the equality of the magnitudes is preserved after the phase redefinitions of the lepton fields , same is not true for the equality of the phases .",
    "hence , the definition of trimaximal mixing adopted here is not rephasing invariant .",
    "this is quite natural since a symmetry may prefer a basis , called symmetry basis , for its definition .",
    "so , it becomes necessary to find the consequences of tm mixing in terms of rephasing invariant quantities .",
    "the mixing angles and cp violating phases must be deduced from these rephasing invariants only .",
    "there are four independent cp - even quadratic invariants @xcite which can conveniently be chosen as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and three independent cp - odd quartic invariants @xcite @xmath30 @xmath31\\ ] ] and @xmath32.\\ ] ] the jarlskog rephasing invariant @xmath23 @xcite is relevant for cp violation in lepton number conserving process like neutrino oscillations and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are relevant for cp violation in lepton number violating processes like neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the consequences of unitarity for tm mixing will be worked out in terms of the above rephasing invariant quantities _ viz . _",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath23 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , it will be rewarding to express the phenomenological implications of trimaximality in term of the usual parameters @xmath39 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath21 of a widely used parametrisation @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . this will be achieved through the relations @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 however , some of the relationships will be more apparent when written in terms of rephasing invariant quantities themselves .    like @xmath51 symmetry and tbm mixing , the tm mixing is mass - independent texture putting no constraints on neutrino masses and majorana phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "hence , trimaximality will have no physical consequences for the majorana phases .",
    "a naive way to work out the consequences of unitarity for trimaximal mixing would have been to compare the magnitudes of the elements of trimaximal mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the unitary mixing matrix of eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "this would mean that @xmath37 , @xmath52 and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) are all equal to @xmath53 with no restriction on their phases . in this version of tm mixing",
    ", trimaximality is imposed only in a weak sense as the elements of the middle column of @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) have unequal phases for any non zero value of @xmath21 and @xmath6 .",
    "this weak form of trimaximality has been already analysed in the literature @xcite for its phenomenological consequences .",
    "if a similar analysis to is to be performed for the trimaximality defined by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , called strong trimaximality to distinguish it from weak trimaximality , which demands that magnitudes as well as the phases of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are equal , one is required to compare the trimaximal @xmath25 of eq . ( 2 ) with the unitary @xmath25 of eq . ( 7 ) only after making its middle column completely real by making a phase rotation on the lepton fields .",
    "this process of making a basis transformation on a mixing matrix to the symmetry basis where the tm mixing is defined is quite natural if the definition of symmetry is not rephasing invariant and prefers some basis .",
    "as stated already , the strong trimaximality is not a rephasing invariant concept unlike weak trimaximality which is a rephasing invariant notion .",
    "however , instead of adapting a unitary matrix by phase rotation to match it with trimaximal mixing as outlined above , the present work attempts to obtain an unitary parametrisation which is trimaximal in the strong sense from the very outset .",
    "the strong trimaximility implies that the mass eigenstate @xmath57 is a democratic and coherent combination of the three flavor eigenstates whereas the week trimaximality relaxes the condition of coherence allowing different flavor eigenstates to mix with equal amplitudes but mismatching phases . however , the distinction between strong and weak trimaximality is not merely conceptual , it is also phenomenological in nature having distinct predictions for cp violation .",
    "the weak trimaximality is less interesting as it does nt fully utilise the phase restrictions on the mass matrix coming from @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "a mixing matrix which is trimaximal in the strong sense was first proposed and studied phenomenologically by bjorken , harrison and scott ( bhs ) @xcite in which the only free complex parameter was @xmath58 .",
    "a neutrino mass matrix having magic symmetry in the basis of a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix was prescribed by lam @xcite which gives rise to tm mixing in bhs parametrization . in another attempt for the minimal modification to the tbm mixing , he and zee @xcite obtained a mixing matrix , which is also trimaximal in strong sense , containing only one free complex parameter .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in a model proposed by grimus and lavoura @xcite is magic and hence gives rise to tm mixing in the strong sense .",
    "however , the mass matrix contains three complex parameters and therefore is more restrictive than a most general magic mass matrix [ eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] containing four complex parameters .",
    "similarly , the resulting tm mixing matrix also contains lesser number of parameters than the most general case .",
    "all the above forms of tm mixing studied phenomenologically in the literature are more constrained than the most general form given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and can be expressed as the product of the tbm mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( 1 ) by a generalized 1 - 3 rotation of the type @xmath59 from the right",
    ". however , the resulting mixing matrix is not the most general tm mixing matrix .",
    "the tm mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be written as @xmath60 by straightforwardly eliminating two elements _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath61 and @xmath62 using the two orthogonality conditions for the three columns .",
    "the remaining 4 elements are further constrained by the following seven constraints coming from the unitarity condition @xmath63 : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 eq . ( 11 ) is a unitary parametrisation of tm mixing subject to the above seven unitarity constraints .",
    "all the parametrizations of tm mixing proposed in the literature @xcite are special cases of the above parametrization and satisfy these seven constraints . however , they are more constrained than the general parametrization obtained here .",
    "a special property of the tm mixing matrix of eq . ( 11 ) , also shared by its earlier parametrizations @xcite , is that its first and third columns add up to zero .",
    "the first four of the seven unitarity constraints can be seen as normalization conditions and the last three as orthogonalization conditions .",
    "the three orthogonalization relations can be solved to get three real variables , say , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 which can be substituted back into the four normalization relations .",
    "this eliminates these three parameters .",
    "two classes of solutions are obtained on solving the four normalisation relations in the remaining five parameters : one is cp conserving while the other is cp violating .",
    "the first solution has three independent parameters which can be chosen as @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath77 can be calculated from the equation @xmath78 the elements @xmath54 and @xmath56 are given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 the resulting mixing matrix has no dirac type cp violation since first two elements in either first or third column have identical phases which results into a vanishing @xmath23 .",
    "there are no constraints on the phases of @xmath77 and @xmath58 and they are not necessary to describe the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations . however , the cp - odd rephasing invariants @xmath33 and @xmath34 do depend upon these phases and are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82    this solution is called @xmath83 conserving as there is no dirac type cp violation here .",
    "trimaximality is a mass - independent texture and it puts no constraints on neutrino masses and majorana phases @xcite .",
