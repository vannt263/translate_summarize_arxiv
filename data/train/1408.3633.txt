    "the fraction of phl 1811 analogs in the radio - quiet quasar population is small , @xmath16 . as a first attempt to constrain the fraction of intrinsically x - ray weak agns systematically , @xcite searched for such objects among optically selected sdss quasars , again excluding radio - loud agns and potentially x - ray absorbed systems .",

    "we note that these column density constraints were derived from the observed hard weakness , independent of the spectral - shape constraints above .",
    "in fact , compton - thick absorption is likely inconsistent with a soft @xmath63 , as discussed in more detail below ( section  5.2 ) .",

    "we estimated bolometric luminosities for our targets from the @xcite",

    "confirmation of such a connection would facilitate our understanding of the nature of their weakness .",

    "the emission lines appear strong in iras  07598 , pg  0946 , pg  1001 , pg  1254 , and mrk  231 , while they are either weak or are contaminated by the broad absorption features in pg  0043 , pg  1004 , and pg  1700 .",
    "therefore , more than half of our targets do not show weak line emission as in phl  1811 .",
    "it is possible that intrinsically weak quasars may exhibit normal optical  uv emission lines if the accretion still produces sufficient euv ( perhaps @xmath97  kev ) radiation to ionize the broad line regions , e.g. , photons with energies exceeding 48  ev are required to ionize and produce the emission line .",
    "a connection between bal quasars and phl 1811 analogs thus can not be excluded .      as discussed extensively in l13 , the hard weakness of these bal quasars observed by _",
    "nustar _  can , in principle , be explained in either the compton - thick absorption or intrinsic weakness scenarios . without high photon counts ,",
    "it is not feasible to constrain their nature individually via spectral analyses as was done for the case of the local object mrk  231 .",
    "however , we have already established that there is apparently a population of intrinsically weak bal quasars ( l13 ; @xcite ) , and we present below some evidence that at least some of our targets here are also intrinsically x - ray weak :    1 .   the soft stacked effective photon index ( @xmath83 ) for the sample ( section  4.1 ) argues against compton - thick absorption in general . )",
    "but it could be dominated by jet emission , and pg  1700 has a hard effective photon index but with a large uncertainty ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the nature of their hard weakness is not clear .",
    "] this is similar to the independent _ chandra _  stacking results in l13 where we also found a relatively soft stacked signal for a subsample of high - redshift bal quasars , which suggests that the stacked source is not compton - thick but is intrinsically x - ray weak .",
    "a soft 324  kev effective photon index is also consistent with the lower energy _",
    "chandra _  or  spectral fitting results ( based on @xmath99 x - ray photons ) for iras  07598 , pg  0946 , pg  1001 , and pg  1254 where no or only moderate ( @xmath100  @xmath21 ) absorption was found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "2 .   all six targets here and the two in the l13 pilot sample are significantly x - ray weak in the _ nustar _  bands , which requires compton - thick obscuration in the absorption scenario .",
    "if these bal quasars with significant x - ray weakness represent an extension of the normal bal - quasar population to higher column densities of @xmath101@xmath102  @xmath21 , then a first order expectation would be that they might consist of both compton - thin and compton - thick objects , similar to the overall agn population .",
    "in this case , the chance of observing a sample of eight objects that are 100% compton - thick is likely small .",
    "a natural explanation is that this is not a pure compton - thick sample and at least some of the targets are intrinsically x - ray weak .",
    "+ in figure  4 , we show the @xmath90 distributions for our _ nustar _",
    "bal - quasar sample ( eight objects in total ) value would be larger ( see section  4.1.1 of l13 ) . ] and those bal quasars collected from the literature @xcite .",
    "constraints in the literature .",
    "we caution that these data might not represent the real @xmath90 distribution as the sample is not complete and the @xmath90 constraints were obtained via different approaches . ]",
    "the combined distribution appears disjoint and perhaps bimodal , missing objects that are heavily obscured but compton - thin , while the _ nustar _  sample stands out in the compton - thick regime forming an apparently distinct peak .",
    "the @xmath90 distribution for typical low - redshift agns does not show such a bimodality ( e.g. , figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "there is no obvious reason why bal quasars would avoid the @xmath103  @xmath21 regime yet not higher @xmath90 values , although we caution that our _ nustar_sample size is still relatively small and the apparent bimodality might be caused by small number statistics ( moreover , we note that the shielding gas responsible for the x - ray absorption in bal quasars is different from the dusty torus in typical obscured agns , and its nature is poorly understood ) .",
    "thus , as a complement to the spectral - shape argument above , figure  4 provides suggestive additional evidence that some of the _ nustar _  objects are not absorbed by compton - thick material but are intrinsically x - ray weak .    in obscured agns , there could be an additional soft continuum component arising from electron scattering of the intrinsic continuum in an ionized medium surrounding the central engine on a larger scale than the x - ray absorber .",
    "the scattering zone has a very small column density so that the scattered continuum has approximately the same shape as the intrinsic continuum . because of this",
    ", the scattered fraction is expected to be small , usually a few percent ( @xmath104 ) or less ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in principle",
    ", this ionized scattered component could perhaps dominate over the compton - reflected component in the observed 324  kev emission of a compton - thick agn if the column density is sufficiently high ( @xmath105  @xmath21 ) . in this case",
    ", the observed x - ray spectrum would appear soft and also be hard weak by a factor of @xmath106 or more .",
    "this scenario could perhaps explain the soft stacked signal of our _ nustar _",
    "sample here without invoking intrinsic x - ray weakness .",
    "however , such a case would arguably be even more extraordinary than the discovery of intrinsically x - ray weak agns , as so far no compelling example of a clearly compton - thick agn with a soft @xmath107  kev continuum has been found ( t. yaqoob 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , our x - ray variability detections for some objects ( see section 3 ) would constrain the size of any scattering medium . therefore , we admit this possibility here but do not consider it likely .    assuming that the observed hard x - ray weakness is entirely intrinsic with no absorption , these targets are intrinsically weak from 324  kev by the factors given in table  2 ( @xmath108 to @xmath109 )",
    ". if there is also absorption present that affects the observed flux , similar to the case of mrk  231 , the factors of intrinsic x - ray weakness would be smaller . for comparison ,",
    "mrk  231 is intrinsically x - ray weak by a factor of @xmath31 after the absorption correction @xcite , and pg  1004 and pg  1700 in l13 are x - ray weak by about the same factor in the intrinsic x - ray weakness scenario .",
    "the underlying physics responsible for intrinsic x - ray weakness is still unclear ; some sort of coronal - quenching mechanism might be relevant for bal quasars ( section 4.2.1 of l13 and references therein ) .",
    "there are two lobal and four hibal quasars in our sample ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "we checked the stacked signals for these two groups of sources separately . for lobal quasars",
    "( iras  07598 and iras  14026 ) , the stacked source is only weakly detected in the band , and the lower limit on the effective photon index is 1.0 ( @xmath110 at a 1@xmath36 confidence level ) . for hibal quasars ,",
    "the stacked effective photon index is @xmath84 . considering that the full sample has a soft effective photon index ( @xmath83 ) , the lobal quasars likely have soft photon indices .",
    "it thus appears likely that both groups contain intrinsically x - ray weak quasars .",
    "all three detected targets show significant flux variability in the 38  kev band when compared to earlier observations ( section 3 ) .",
    "usually we would not expect such significant variability in a compton - thick agn where the spectrum is likely dominated by a compton - reflected component , as variability would be washed out during reflection over an extended region .",
    "however , for our bal - quasar targets here , the x - ray absorber ( shielding gas ) is located on a significantly smaller physical scale than the torus in typical obscured agns ( @xmath1810@xmath19  cm vs.  parsec scale ) and the variability observed is on multi - year timescales .",
    "it is possible that a reflection - dominated spectrum could show long - term variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the scenario of compton - thick absorption can not be excluded by such variability . due to the limited photon statistics of the _ nustar _  and/or previous _ chandra _  and  data , we can not constrain the variability of the spectral shape ( e.g. , @xmath63 ) for these three targets .",
    "the fraction of intrinsically x - ray weak quasars among our sample objects is likely high .",
    "the soft stacked signal is not dominated by one single object , and a lower limit on the fraction is @xmath111 ( at least two out of six being intrinsically x - ray weak ) with an upper limit of 100% ( all being intrinsically weak ) .",
    "our targets were selected to be significantly weak in the @xmath6  kev band , and thus the intrinsic x - ray weakness fraction among the general bal - quasar population will be lower . the fraction is estimated to be in the lbqs bal - quasar sample ( l13 ) , much larger than the @xmath17 fraction among non - bal quasars @xcite .",
    "l13 suggested that the disk wind in an intrinsically weak quasar might have a large covering factor as it is likely easier to launch the wind when the nuclear x - ray emission is weak .",
    "thus intrinsically weak quasars would be preferentially observed as bal quasars .",
    "constraints for the _ nustar_bal - quasar sample ( red histogram and lower limits ) , assuming the observed hard x - ray weakness is caused by absorption . for comparison , @xmath90 distributions for typical bal quasars collected from the literature @xcite are shown as the blue ( @xmath90 derived from spectral fitting ) and green ( @xmath90 derived from hardness - ratio analysis ) histograms and upper limits .",

    "the derived column - density constraints in an absorption scenario are all in the compton - thick regime . however ,",
    "stacking and joint spectral analyses of the data indicate a soft effective photon index , generally disfavoring compton - thick absorption .",
    "moreover , the uniform hard x - ray weakness observed in this sample and also the pilot sample suggests that the weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets .",
    "we conclude that _ nustar _  observations of bal - quasar samples have likely discovered a significant population ( @xmath7 ) of intrinsically x - ray weak sources among the bal quasars with significantly weak @xmath6  kev emission .",
    "we emphasize that the disk wind in an intrinsically weak quasar might have a large covering factor , and thus the source would be preferentially observed as an bal quasar .",
    "it would be worthwhile to obtain additional _ nustar _",
    "observations of our targets , so that better constraints can be derived on the spectral shapes of individual and stacked sources . for example , by tripling the exposure times , the three undetected sources should in general be detected in the band and the stacked source of these three will probably be detected in the 824  kev band , as suggested by the current stacking results . meanwhile ,",
    "pg  1001 and pg  1254 should likely be individually detected in the band .",
    "the improved spectral - shape constraints would provide a tighter constraint on the fraction of intrinsically x - ray weak quasars among this sample .",
    "moreover , by increasing the exposure times by factors of @xmath1310 , sufficient photon statistics could probably be obtained for some individual targets to allow identification of intrinsically x - ray weak quasars in the sample via basic spectral analysis and accurate measurements of a soft @xmath63 .",
    "such longer observations could be divided into a few segments to probe any short - term variability of the targets ; ideally these segments should be separated by somewhat less than the expected light - crossing time of the shielding gas ( @xmath10840  days in the rest frame ) .",
    "it would also be valuable to select additional intrinsically x - ray weak candidates for _ nustar _",
    "observations , although sources satisfying the selection criteria in section  2 are rare largely due to the lack of systematic bal - quasar selection at low redshifts ( @xmath114 ) , where the key transition is generally not accessible via ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "such studies could probably also be extended to include `` mini - bal '' quasars , which have narrower absorption troughs ( wide ) than bal quasars yet may share their other properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
