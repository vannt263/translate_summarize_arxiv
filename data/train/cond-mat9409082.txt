    "the discovery of superconductivity above 30k in la@xmath5ba@xmath6cuo@xmath7 by bednorz and mller  @xcite has stimulated intensive studies on various cuprates as well as the mechanism underlying the phenomenon of high-_t_@xmath0  superconductivity .",
    "a wide variety of speculations about its microscopic origin have been raised with the sole consensus of the apparently important role of the cuo@xmath1  layer ( and , of course , the pairing of charge carriers ) which is the basic building block of high-_t_@xmath0  cuprates . even for the _ normal _ ( above _ t_@xmath0 ) state of the high-_t_@xmath0  cuprates , the controversy as to whether it is a fermi liquid or some other novel states has not been settled .",
    "the reason for the complication is that many of the cuprate superconductors have sister compounds which are strongly correlated insulating antiferromagnets . among novel points of view explaining anomaly in normal states of high-_t_@xmath0  cuprates are the luttinger liquid theory , the marginal fermi liquid theory , the van hove scenario , the spin fluctuation theory , the extended hubbard model , the t-_j _ model , and the anyon theory , to mention a few . on the other side of such efforts ,",
    "there has been a more conventional approach dealing with the full hamiltonian and the realistic atomic structure in the belief of the fermi liquid theory ; the first principles density functional theory  @xcite with the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation energy is such an example . in spite of its shortcomings in the magnetic insulating phase ,",
    "the various state - of - the - art electronic structure calculations have proven to be successful in predicting from first principles a number of properties of metallic cuprates such as the lattice constant , atomic positions within the unit cell , phonon frequencies , structural instabilities , electric field gradients , and most importantly , the detailed energy band structure and the fermi surface ( fs )  @xcite .",
    "such calculations show the existence of a half - filled @xmath8-antibonding band and the resulting cylindrical fs per cuo@xmath1  plane as the distinctive electronic feature of the high-_t_@xmath0  cuprates  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing electronic structures for high-_t_@xmath0cuprates have been calculated with use of the all - electron localized basis methods ( lmto , flmto , lapw , or flapw ) or the pseudopotential   mixed basis method . here , we want to emphasize the merits of the plane - wave basis set , which above - mentioned methods do not share .",
    "the mathematical formulation and the implementation of the numerical codes are particularly simple with the plane - wave basis set .",
    "the accuracy of calculation is easily controlled by varying the kinetic energy cutoff .",
    "plane - waves form a basis set independent of the ionic positions , allowing for an unbiased uniform description of the system and a much simpler calculation of quantum mechanical ( hellman - feynman ) forces . furthermore",
    ", plane waves enable us to use the fast fourier transform so that the iterative diagonalization methods  @xcite or the _ ab initio _  molecular dynamics  @xcite can be applied efficiently . in conjunction with the pseudopotentialformulation  @xcite where the rapid oscillations of valence wavefunctions in the core region are systematically smoothed out with their norms",
    "kept conserved , the plane - wave basis sets are quite successful in the calculation of the electronic structure of most semiconductors and some metals . however , until recently it was believed that materials including first - row elements , transition - metal atoms , and rare - earth elements are not suitable for the application of the pseudopotential plane - wave  method . with the development of efficient methods for diagonalizing large hamiltonian matrices represented in a plane - wave basis set  @xcite , together with relatively smooth pseudopotentials  @xcite",
    ", it is now possible to perform the electronic structure calculations for systems containing such atoms .    in this paper , we present an _ ab initio _  pseudopotential  density - functional calculation of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  using the plane - wave basis set .",
    "yba@xmath1cu@xmath9o@xmath10 @xmath11 is perhaps the most extensively studied compound among the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a unique feature of this compound is that the three copper atoms in the primitive cell play two different roles .",
    "two copper atoms ( cu2 ) participate in two conduction layers of cuo@xmath1  separated by yttrium atoms . the third copper atom ( cu1 )",
    "has an unusual coordination with oxygen atoms , forming a one - dimensional cuo chain structure along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the stoichiometric compound yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  is particularly interesting from the standpoint of band theorists .",
    "it crystallizes in the relatively simple structure ( with 13 atoms in the orthorhombic primitive cell ) allowing for the computation with a less severe load compared with bi- or tl - based cuprate superconductors .",
    "more importantly , it is a metal instead of an antiferromagnetic insulator in its normal state in contrast to other stoichiometric cuprates like la@xmath1cuo@xmath7 . aside from the problem in handling the strong correlation among electrons ,",
    "the local density functional  ( ldf ) calculation is applicable to this system .",
    "furthermore , clean surfaces are available in this compound so that high resolution spectroscopic experiments can be performed and the theoretical results can be compared directly with experiments . the quasiparticle band near the fermi level and the fs topology from the arpes  @xcite , acar  @xcite , and dhva  @xcite experiments are in good accordance with those obtained from the existing ldf calculations  @xcite .",
    "this fact is sometimes regarded as supporting evidence for the fermi liquid picture of the normal state of high-_t_@xmath0  cuprates though the issue is still controversial . since the main purpose of the present work is to show the feasibility of the _ ab initio _",
    "pseudopotential plane - wave  method for studying high-_t_@xmath0  materials in comparison with other methods and since the present paper is the first such report to our knowledge , we will exhibit below a rather extensive amount of figures obtained through the fully - converged pseudopotential  calculation , but avoid promoting a particular theory for the high-_t_@xmath0  superconducting mechanism .",
    "we generate soft norm - conserving pseudopotentials using the scheme of troullier and martins  @xcite , which gives a very fast convergence of the total energy with respect to the basis - set size .",
    "( it is possible to use _ ultrasoft _ pseudopotentials  @xcite which require a much smaller basis set size at the price of abandoning the norm - conserving property , but we do not adopt that scheme here . ) to enhance the transferability of the pseudopotential  and guarantee correct scattering properties of the pseudopotential , we include some semi - core orbitals into the valence shell and use ionized configurations for the atoms y and ba . the configuration and the cutoff radii @xmath13 s with which the pseudopotentials are generated are listed in table  [ t : paramt - pp ] .",
    "all the pseudopotentials , except for the oxygen pseudopotential , are generated semi - relativistically .",
    "the partial core correction scheme  @xcite is employed to overcome the problem associated with the nonlinearity of the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the ceperly - alder correlation  @xcite is used in the parametrized version of perdew and zunger  @xcite .",
    "these pseudopotentials are then cast into the fully - nonlocal separable form of kleinman and bylander  @xcite with use of @xmath14-locality to avoid the ghost states  @xcite .",
    "the norm - conserving requirement results in the matched first energy derivative of the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction ,   @xmath15 ,   between the pseudo radial wavefunction and the all - electron one , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radial wavefunction and the valence orbital energy for angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the pseudopotentials optimized by us with the above scheme show scattering properties acceptable in a much wider energy range than enforced by the norm - conserving condition .",
    "we then perform the plane - wave band structure calculations within the lda .",
    "the single - particle kohn - sham equation is solved by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix  @xcite .",
    "diagonalization is achieved by using the block - davidson method  @xcite with the modified jacobi relaxation  @xcite . at this point , we want to mention the superiority of the block - davidson method with the modified jacobi relaxation to two other competing methods , the diis-_ritzit _",
    "@xcite and the preconditioned conjugate gradient  @xcite methods , in dealing with systems with relatively localized states .",
    "we have tested these three diagonalization schemes by studying the cubic zns with variable submatrix sizes .",
    "for relatively small submatrix sizes , the block - davidson method still gives correct results , whereas the latter two methods frequently fail to do it .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that the block - davidson method updates the eigenvectors simultaneously while the latter two adopt a band - by - band updating scheme .",
    "actually , there exists a crossover behavior in relative merits among the three schemes .",
    "if the number of desired states is very large , the computational load in diagonalizing the hamiltonian projected to the expansion space is too severe with the first method and the latter two methods with a sufficiently large submatrix is preferable to the first one .",
    "as the number decreases , however , the computational effort of the first method in the diagonalization of the expansion - space - projected hamiltonian is greatly reduced and the block - davidson method is superior to the other two .",
