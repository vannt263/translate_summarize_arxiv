    "such models have been applied extensively to the spectroscopy of many - body systems , including nuclei  @xcite and molecules  @xcite .",
    "the coherent states of an algebraic model are obtained by repeated action of a general linear combination of boson creation operators on the vacuum state .",
    "as variational trial states , the coherent states allow the estimation of the ground state energies and properties , yielding results which become exact in the infinite boson number limit  @xcite .",
    "they are also essential in defining the classical limit for the model  @xcite , providing the geometric coordinates or dynamical variables of the model .",
    "coherent states may also be used to study the intrinsic excitation modes of an algebraic system  @xcite , through the construction of coherent states orthogonal to the ground state . however , application of this method has generally been limited to excited states involving only one intrinsic excitation quantum , or at most two  @xcite , due to the complexity of calculating the necessary matrix elements . in the present work , a general expression is obtained for the matrix element of an @xmath0-body operator between coherent states constructed from multiple orthogonal linear combinations of boson creation operators .",
    "this allows the coherent state formalism to be applied to states possessing an arbitrarily large number of intrinsic excitation quanta .",
    "the necessary definitions for the basic ground state ( condensate ) coherent state are first presented , and the results for expectation values with respect to this state are reviewed ( section  [ seccondensate ] ) . the general result for excited coherent states",
    "is then established ( section  [ secmulti ] ) . as a simple illustration ,",
    "calculations are carried out for excited states in the @xmath4 dynamical symmetry limit of the molecular two - dimensional vibron model  @xcite ( section  [ secvibron ] ) .",
    "an algebraic model based upon a bosonic realization of @xmath3 is obtained by defining @xmath5 bosonic creation operators @xmath6 , @xmath7,@xmath8 , @xmath9 obeying the canonical commutation relations @xmath10\\<=0 $ ] , @xmath11\\<=\\delta_{i , j}$ ] , and @xmath12\\<=0 $ ] .",

    "these operators act on the states of the fock space created by @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the condensate coherent state is defined in terms of the `` condensate boson '' creation operator , which is a general linear combination @xmath17 with complex coefficients satisfying the normalization convention @xmath18 .",

    "the expectation value of a one - body or two - body operator with respect to the condensate  ( [ eqncoherentc ] ) was deduced by van  isacker and chen  @xcite , using arguments based upon formal differentiation . here",
    "let us derive an explicit result for the expectation value of an arbitrary @xmath0-body operator , since the results of section  [ secmulti ] can be obtained as a natural extension .",

    "for the study of excited states , it is necessary to consider coherent states which are orthogonal to the condensate state .",
