    "among the fascinating aspects of the new high - temperature superconducting materials , there are many which are due to the rich and complex behavior of vortex lines @xcite .",
    "these quanta of magnetic flux penetrate the superconductor above a certain threshold value of the external magnetic field @xmath0 , the so - called _ lower critical field _",
    "@xmath1 ( roughly @xmath2 , and their concentration increases with @xmath0 up to the _ upper critical field _ @xmath3 ( approximately @xmath4 ) , above which the material is normal@xcite ( see figure  [ mfphases ] ) . in a classic work , abrikosov showed that the minimum energy arrangement of flux lines in a conventional superconductor is a triangular lattice , with a lattice spacing @xmath5 which varies with the magnetic field strength@xcite .    recently , with the discovery of high temperature cuprate superconductors , there has been a resurgence of interest in the properties of vortex matter .",
    "one novel aspect of these materials is the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "a series of experiments @xcite seem to provide evidence consistent with @xmath6-wave symmetry , in contrast to conventional superconductors which have @xmath7-wave symmetry .",
    "in addition to modifying the internal structure of the vortex lines , @xmath6-wave symmetry has implications for the global mean - field arrangement of the vortex lattice @xcite . in particular , an oblique square lattice appears to replace the standard triangular arrangement , as the most stable configuration in part of the @xmath8 phase diagram @xcite .",
    "( the new phase appears for high values of the magnetic field , whereas the triangular arrangement is confined to low fields . )    furthermore , the relative flexibility of vortex lines in these materials makes them susceptible to distortions by thermal fluctuations , and other sources of disorder ( oxygen impurities , grain boundaries , etc . ) .",
    "the regular lattices obtained in mean - field theory are thus distorted , giving rise to a rich variety of vortex - matter phases@xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to understand the elastic response of vortex lattices to distortions , a subject that has been intensely studied in the context of conventional superconductors .",
    "the stability of the triangular lattice against small distortions is guaranteed as long as the characteristic length of the field variations , the so - called _ penetration depth _",
    "@xmath9 , remains smaller than the size of the system @xcite .",
    "( an infinite @xmath9 renders the lattice of vortex lines unstable against fluctuations or , more precisely , against shear deformations . ) at low temperatures , fluctuations are well described by small corrections to the mean - field results .",
    "although the phenomenology is similar for @xmath6-wave superconductors , less is known about the effects of thermal fluctuations and disorder in this case .",
    "we shall thus focus on a triangular lattice of vortex lines .",
    "the extension of the results to oblique configurations is possible , and should prove interesting .",
    "the elastic properties of the triangular vortex lattice at long distances are characterized by its compressional , shear , and tilt moduli .",
    "these moduli are frequently involved in the theoretical and experimental determination of the properties of the material , as for example , the intricate vortex phase diagrams . as such , the derivation of the elastic energy and the elastic moduli has been undertaken in several publications @xcite . while it is well known that the elastic moduli of the vortex lattice depend strongly on the magnetic field strength , the values currently presented in the literature are only strictly useful in certain limiting situations .",
    "most frequently , results are obtained in the so - called _ continuum limit _ , in which one disregards the discrete nature of the underlying vortex lattice . obviously , this description is not suitable for the whole range of possible flux - line densities in the mixed state , which extends from @xmath1 up to the upper critical field @xmath3 , at which the magnetic field penetrates uniformly into the material .",
    "the elastic properties of the vortex lattice , and hence its stability against thermal fluctuations , depend sensitively on the value of the magnetic field in this range .",
    "furthermore , the important fluctuations sometimes occur at short wavelengths , where a simple elastic description may not be appropriate .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to obtain the general dependence of the energy cost of harmonic distortions of the vortex lattice .",
    "= 8truecm    as temperature is increased , thermal fluctuations cause the vortex lattice to _ melt _ into a vortex liquid .",
    "several experiments employing quite different techniques have provided firm evidence for such a transition @xcite . in the new cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the melting transition can occur at temperatures well below the mean field point , so that the abrikosov lattice is melted over a substantial portion of the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , the vortex lattice can melt not only by increasing temperature , but also by decreasing the magnetic field to the vicinity of @xmath10 . in this region of the phase diagram , the concentration of vortices is very dilute ; the separation @xmath5 between neighboring flux lines is larger than the penetration length @xmath9 , and the vortex - vortex interaction decays exponentially . as a consequence ,",
    "the elastic moduli become exponentially small , and correspondingly , thermal fluctuations are greatly enhanced .",
    "this behavior gives rise to an interesting reentrant behavior of the melting line at low fields .    in this paper , we take up the computation of the elastic properties of a vortex lattice , in a systematic manner which is not restricted to the most commonly considered continuum limit . our analysis allows the illustration of some of the subtleties involved in the calculation , and to successfully resolve some of the unclear points that we encountered in our review of the literature , and which may also have puzzled other investigators of the subject .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] , we introduce the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian for an anisotropic superconductor .",
    "this model is commonly used in the literature as the starting point for studying the effects of fluctuations and disorder .",
    "minimization of this hamiltonian gives the optimal lattice configuration , around which we then study the cost of distortions in the harmonic approximation .",
    "this section also introduces the main parameters and notation used throughout the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : moduli ] , we provide an expression for the harmonic kernel in terms of a sum over bravais lattice vectors or , equivalently , over reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the normal mode eigenvalues are explicitly written in terms of this kernel .",
    "[ sec : limits ] is composed of subsections in which we introduce certain limiting situations , corresponding to a single line , local , local  continuum , and nonlocal  continuum limits .",
    "these limiting cases are often quoted in the literature , and are widely used in studies of vortex matter in high temperature superconductors . within our framework , we recalculate the analytic values of the elastic eigenvalues in these limits before discussing our more general results in section [ sec : numeric ] , where the harmonic eigenvalues are numerically evaluated .",
    "our results are graphically presented in several plots , and compared to the limits introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] , to easily visualize the accuracy of the approximations involved . as a practical illustration of the potential applications of our results ,",
    "we use the harmonic eigenvalues to calculate the thermal distortions of the vortex lattice in section [ sec : melting ] .",
    "the leading contribution to flux - line fluctuations in real space comes from the transverse modes . in conjunction with the lindeman s criterion",
    ", we can then find the full form of the melting line as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "this is one of many potential applications that our general analysis makes possible , without the need to extrapolate the elastic behavior of the lattice to regimes beyond their range of validity .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize our main conclusions .",

    "the latter curves overlap in the high field region , where neither the local tilt , nor the shear modulus depend on @xmath185 . rather than decreasing as @xmath306 , the resulting melting temperature reaches a constant value for high @xmath307 , i.e. @xmath308 . on the other hand , the local melting temperature provides a very good approximation to the melting line at very dilute concentrations , in the reentrant low field portion of the curve .",
    "in conclusion , we have obtained the elastic moduli of the flux line lattice in a systematic and detailed way which is not restricted to the most commonly considered continuum limit .",
    "the transversal and longitudinal harmonic eigenvalues have been computed numerically for different areal densities of flux lines , and as a function of @xmath217 ( within the irreducible brillouin zone ) and @xmath132 .",
    "several features emerge from the analysis of our results : * ( i ) * there is a weak angular dependence of the harmonic eigenvalues which becomes more pronounced on approaching the bz boundary . *",
    "( ii ) * throughout the bz , transversal modes are less costly than longitudinal modes , and are the main cause of lattice fluctuations . * ( iii ) * not surprisingly , both eigenvalues increase with @xmath204 , and modes with higher @xmath132 are more costly . *",
    "( iv ) * rather surprisingly , due to a rapid decrease of @xmath239 , the energy of a transversal mode with a nonzero @xmath132 actually goes down with @xmath217 .",
    "the minimum cost occurs for a finite @xmath217 which depends on @xmath204 , and the density of flux lines . *",
    "( iv ) * for a large portion of the ibz , both eigenvalues exhibit a linear dependence on @xmath190 , whose slope depends on the local shear modulus @xmath138 which can be calculated as a function of @xmath133 .",
    "some of the above features are qualitatively well accounted for by the nonlocal continuum limit results recalculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] .",
    "nevertheless , beyond a characteristic value of @xmath204 , there are major differences between this analytic form and those calculated numerically .",
    "guided by our results , we propose analytic corrections to the nonlocal continuum limit , which fit quite well the behavior of the elastic eigenvalues throughout the london regime .",
    "other limiting forms for the elastic energy often quoted in the literature , such as the single line , local , and local continuum approximations , are reconsidered within our framework , and their range of validity is examined .",
    "we have plotted some of these limits , together with our numerical results , for better ease of comparison .",
    "we also consider different values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath185 , in particular corresponding to values quoted in the literature for high temperature superconductors such as ybco or biscco .",
    "the latter is the paradigm of a highly anisotropic superconductor with softer elastic eigenvalues .",
    "this fact can be corroborated in our analysis and is ultimately responsible for strengthening the magnitude of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we have made use of our proposed analytical expression to calculate the extent of thermal fluctuations for different @xmath185 .",
    "the full form of the melting curve is then obtained using the lindeman criterion , capturing the following salient features of @xmath262 : * ( i ) * it decreases at high temperatures with the magnetic field , approximately as @xmath284 . *",
    "( ii ) * it decreases with the anisotropy parameter , and consequently the molten vortex liquid covers a large fraction of the equilibrium phase diagram at small @xmath185 . * ( iii ) * there is reentrant melting at low fields due to the weak interactions between widely separated flux lines .",
    "the reentrant phase boundary is itself a non - monotonic function of temperature . *",
    "( iv ) * close to the critical temperature @xmath272 , both branches of the melting line @xmath309 can be fitted to power laws in the reduced temperature @xmath310",
    ". however , the power law is observed at most over two decades , and the resulting effective exponents are different from the expectations from mean field theory , casting doubt upon the effectiveness of this method @xcite .",
    "another interesting potential extension of this work is to include entropic contributions to the free energy , in order to explore the fluctuation induced effects which have been proposed to be important in the low field region of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "our analysis has been applied to a conventional s - wave superconductor with a triangular lattice of flux lines .",
    "a square lattice of flux lines is also possible in d - wave superconductors , where similar approach and phenomenology can be carried out , although the details of the harmonic energy , as dictated by symmetry , will be different .",
    "again , calculation of the entropic contributions to the free energy may provide a better estimate of the transition between triangular and square lattices @xcite .",
