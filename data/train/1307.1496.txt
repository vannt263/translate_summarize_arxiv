    "<S> equivalence of the influence of quenched and annealed disorder on scaling properties of long flexible polymer chains is proved by analyzing the @xmath0-symmetric field theory in polymer ( de gennes ) limit @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> additional symmetry properties of the model in this limit are discussed .    in real physical processes , </S>",
    "<S> one is often interested how structural obstacles ( impurities ) in the environment alter the behavior of a system . in polymer physics , of great importance </S>",
    "<S> is understanding of the behavior of macromolecules in the presence of structural disorder , e.g. , in colloidal solutions @xcite , in vicinity of microporous membranes @xcite or in a crowded environment of biological cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> structural obstacles strongly effect the protein folding and aggregation @xcite .    dealing with systems that display randomness of structure </S>",
    "<S> , one usually encounters two types of ensemble averaging , treated as annealed and quenched disorder @xcite . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic time of impurities dynamics is comparable to relaxation times in the pure system and impurity variables are a part of the disordered system phase space , whereas in the latter case the impurities can be considered as fixed and thus one needs to perform configurational average over an ensemble of disordered systems with different realization of the disorder . in principle , the critical behavior of systems with quenched and annealed disorder is quite different . for magnetic systems with annealed disorder </S>",
    "<S> it was proved long ago @xcite , that when a heat capacity critical exponent of an undiluted system @xmath2 is positive , then any critical index @xmath3 of an annealed system is determined by those of the corresponding pure one @xmath4 by simple relation ( so - called fisher renormalization ) : @xmath5 the quenched disorder causes changes in the critical indexes also only if @xmath2 of corresponding system is positive ( this statement is known as harris criterion @xcite ) ; however , the quantitative influence is far not so trivial as in annealed case and serves as a subject of intensive studies ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is established , that some conformational statistical properties of long flexible polymer chains in good solvent are governed by universal scaling exponents . as an example , the effective linear size such as averaged mean - squared end - to - end distance of a long flexible polymer chain scales with the number of monomers ( mass ) of the chain @xmath6 as : @xmath7 with a universal exponent @xmath8 depending on space dimension @xmath9 only ( e.g. , the phenomenological flory theory @xcite gives @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that at @xmath11 the intrachain steric interactions are irrelevant , and the polymer behaves as an idealized gaussian chain with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation of the polymer size exponent to the correlation length critical index of the @xmath13-component spin vector model in the formal limit @xmath1 was provided by p .- </S>",
    "<S> . de gennes ( a well - known de gennes limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to apply the advanced field theory approach developed to study the critical behavior of magnetic systems , to analyze the scaling properties of polymers .    </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the influence of annealed disorder on the polymer size exponent encounters some controversies . as it was pointed out in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an attempt to apply directly the fisher renormalization ( [ fisher ] ) fails in this case . </S>",
    "<S> really , e.g. in @xmath14 for polymer system @xmath15 is positive , and according to ( [ fisher ] ) one receives : @xmath16 , which is unphysical : extension of a chain beyond its total length ( @xmath17 ) is not possible . note , however , that similar misunderstanding arises , when trying to apply the harris criterion to analyze the influence of point - like uncorrelated quenched disorder on scaling properties of polymers : though both in @xmath14 and @xmath18 the corresponding values of @xmath19 is positive , such a type of disorder does not alter the values of scaling exponents ( it has been proved analytically by kim @xcite and supported in numerous numerical studies @xcite ) . only correlated quenched disorder , leading to appearance of pore - like structures of fractal nature ( e.g. percolation clusters ) was shown to influence the conformational properties of polymer macromolecules in a non - trivial manner @xcite . in a number of works @xcite it </S>",
    "<S> is pointed out that the distinction between quenched and annealed averages for an infinitely long single polymer chain is negligible . in the present study , </S>",
    "<S> we aim to confirm these suggestions by providing the simple arguments , based on refined field - theoretical approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the edwards continuous chain model @xcite , considering a linear polymer chain in a solution in the presence of structural obstacles presented by a path @xmath20 , parameterized by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is also called the gaussian surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of the system is given by functional integral : @xmath23\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , an integration is performed over different polymer path @xmath24 configurations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in the exponent represents the chain connectivity , the second term describes the short range excluded volume interaction with bare coupling constant @xmath25 , and the last term contains random potential @xmath26 arising due to the presence of structural disorder . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath27 the average over different realizations of disorder and introduce notation for the second moment : @xmath28 with @xmath29 being some constant ( the first moment of the distribution @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case of structural disorder in the form of point - like uncorrelated defects corresponds to : @xmath31 ( kronecker delta function ) , whereas another interesting situation when structural obstacles are spatially correlated at large distances may correspond to @xcite : @xmath32    in order to average the free energy @xmath33 of the system over different configurations of _ quenched _ disorder , the usual replica method is used @xcite , which is based on formal relation @xmath34 for replicated partition sum of continious chain model @xmath35 one receives : @xmath36 with an effective hamiltonian : @xmath37 here , greek indices denote replicas and the last term , describing effective interaction between replicas , appears due to the presence of disorder in environment .    to take into account the _ annealed _ disorder , one deals with averaged partition sum in the form @xmath38 with an effective hamiltonian : @xmath39 we aim to show , that both model ( [ hcon ] ) and ( [ hconann ] ) are equivalent in renormalization group sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the model ( [ hcon ] ) may be mapped to a field theory by a laplace transform from the gaussian surface @xmath22 to the conjugated chemical potential variable ( mass ) @xmath40 according to @xcite : @xmath41{\\cal z}^n(s).\\ ] ] exploiting the analogy between the polymer problem and @xmath0 symmetric field theory in the limit @xmath1 ( de  gennes limit ) @xcite , it can be shown @xcite that the problem of disordered polymer system is related to the @xmath42-component field theory with an effective lagrangean : @xmath43-\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{v_0}{4!}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1}^{n } \\int{\\rm d}^dx\\,{\\rm d}^dy\\ , g(x - y ) { \\vec{\\phi}_{\\alpha}}^2(x){\\vec{\\phi}_{\\beta}}^2(y ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{leff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , each @xmath44 is an @xmath13-component vector field @xmath45 and the last term describing replicas coupling contains the correlation function in the form ( [ uncor ] ) or ( [ cor ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the effective lagrangean ( [ leff ] ) is studied in the limiting case @xmath46 that corresponds to quenched disorder . </S>",
    "<S> let us note , however , that another limit @xmath47 has physical interpretation , too . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as it was shown in @xcite , this limit corresponds to the annealed disorder . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the problem of analysis of scaling properties of a polymer chain in two different types of disorder is reduced to study of the critical properties of the field theory ( 13 ) in the polymer limit @xmath48 and two different limits @xmath46 ( quenched disorder ) and @xmath49 ( annealed disorder ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the ways of extracting the scaling behavior of the model  ( [ leff ] ) is to apply the field - theoretical renormalization group  ( rg ) method @xcite in the massive scheme , with the green s functions renormalization at non - zero mass and zero external momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the bare green s function @xmath50 can be defined as an average of @xmath6 field components performed with the corresponding effective lagrangean @xmath51 : @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the sets of external momenta , @xmath54 is the set of bare coupling constants and @xmath55 is a cut - off .     diagrammatic representation of quartic potentials in ( [ leff]).,width=302 ]    let us start by representing the two quartic potentials in ( [ leff ] ) in the form of four - leg vertices accordingly to so - called  </S>",
    "<S> faithful representation \" @xcite , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows convenient representation of the terms in perturbation theory expansions of the bare green functions in coupling @xmath25 and @xmath29 by diagrams , given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the arguments given below are valid in any order of the perturbation theory . however , for simplicity , we restrict ourselves by the second - order expansion of a function @xmath56 ( so - called  two - loop \" approximation : in this case , only those diagrammatic contributions are taken into account , which contain no more than two closed loops ) : @xmath57 here , the following notation is used : @xmath58 denotes loop integral , corresponding to diagram ( z ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , containing @xmath59 vertices of the type @xmath25 and @xmath60 vertices of the type @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the loop integrals are dependent on the type of quartic interaction , e.g. in the case of point - like uncorrelated disorder ( [ uncor ] ) , the integrals corresponding to diagram ( e ) read : @xmath61 whereas in the case of long - range correlated disorder , corresponding to ( [ cor ] ) , one has @xcite : @xmath62     contributions into the green s function @xmath63 up to two - loop approximation . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines denote propagators @xmath64 , loops imply integration over internal momenta @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> every interactive diagram appears twice , once with each of the two couplings @xmath25 and @xmath29 , respectively.,width=302 ]    the combinatorial prefactors corresponding to each loop integral in series ( [ ggg ] ) are defined , however , only by the topological type of corresponding diagram . </S>",
    "<S> one may easily check , that the diagrams , containing closed loops , produce combinatorial prefactors , proportional to @xmath13 or @xmath66 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to note , that @xmath67 appears _ only _ in combinations , where it is multiplied by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the same feature is observed also in analyzing any other green function @xmath68 in any order of perturbation theory in coupling constants @xmath25 , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the polymer limit @xmath1 is implied , all the renormalization group functions simultaneously become @xmath67-independent . recalling discussion below ( [ leff ] ) concerning dependence of the type of averaging on the choice of replica parameter @xmath67 , this leads us to straightforward conclusion : as long as the polymer problem is under interest , both quenched ( @xmath69 ) and annealed ( @xmath70 ) averaging are equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now recall once more the effective hamiltonian , describing continuous polymer chain in disordered environment ( [ hcon ] ) and corresponding field - theoretical model ( [ leff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion about @xmath67-independence in polymer limit alows us to put @xmath71 directly into these expressions , obtaining respectively : @xmath72-\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{v_0}{4!}\\int{\\rm d}^dx\\,{\\rm d}^dy\\ , g(x - y ) { \\vec{\\phi}}^2(x){\\vec{\\phi}}^2(y).\\label{leff1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one immediately reveals the equivalence of ( [ hcon1 ] ) with corresponding hamiltonian of the system with annealed disorder ( [ hconann ] ) . in performing analytical calculations </S>",
    "<S> one can thus restrict oneself to the simpler case of annealed averaging , which considerably simplifies the renormalization group procedure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of point - like uncorrelated defects ( taking correlation function in the form ( [ uncor ] ) ) one then notices the equivalence of the last two terms in both ( [ hcon1 ] ) and ( [ leff1 ] ) , which in turn allows to adsorb the third term ( arising due the presence of disorder ) into the second term ( describing the excluded volume effect ) by simple redefinition of coupling constant @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the renormalization group sence the presence of uncorrelated point - like defects at low densities does not influence the scaling properties of polymers . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion was obtained earlier for the case of polymers in quenched disorder by kim @xcite on the basis of a much more refined field - theoretical study . </S>"
