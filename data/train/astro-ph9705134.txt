    "the next several years should be very exciting for cosmologists : microwave anisotropy probe ( map ; @xcite ) and planck ( @xcite ) will make high resolution maps of the microwave background sky ; while the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ; see also http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/ ) will measure redshifts of 10@xmath5 galaxies and positions of 10@xmath6 galaxies . in this paper , we explore the _ direct _ connection between these two measurements through gravitational lensing : the path of a cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photon is distorted by inhomogeneities in the matter distribution ; galaxy surveys detect these inhomogeneities as fluctuations in galaxy number counts .",
    "the effect of the gravitational lensing on the cmb anisotropies has been studied by many authors .",
    "the uncomfortably low upper limits ( @xcite ) provoked a great deal of controversy ( @xcite ) about the possibility that gravitational lensing washes out the intrinsic fluctuation .",
    "after the detection by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ; @xcite ) , there has been renewal of interest ( @xcite , b , @xcite , b , @xcite ) in investigating how the cmb power spectrum is redistributed owing to gravitational lensing .",
    "for example , seljak ( 1996 ) recently presented detailed calculations of gravitationally deflected cmb power spectra , including the effect of the nonlinear evolution of matter density fluctuations .",
    "his result shows , however , that the modification of the cmb power spectrum is a second - order effect of the photon bending angle and less than a few percent on angular scales greater than ten arcminutes .",
    "hence , the lensing effect on the cmb spectrum itself is extremely difficult to detect , even with observations such as the map project .",
    "linder ( 1997 ) has also studied the effects of lensing on the correlation function and has introduced a cross - correlation function similar to the one that we study here .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a cross - correlation function that is sensitive to the gravitational lensing correlations between the temperature fluctuations and matter density fluctuations .",
    "we show that the cross - correlation is first - order in the bending angle so it should be easier to detect if we have both accurate cmb maps and redshift surveys .",
    "we quantitatively estimate its magnitude and its cosmic variance in cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the formalism developed by seljak ( 1996 ) for computing the angular excursion of the cmb photon paths on celestial sphere in section  2 . in section  3",
    ", we formulate the cross - correlation between matter density inhomogeneities and cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "section  4 concludes .",
    "in this section , we review gravitational lensing by density fluctuations . we follow the power spectrum approach of seljak ( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "we focus on the angular excursions produced by matter fluctuations at low redshifts , where they can be most easily inferred from redshift surveys .",
    "fluctuations in matter density , @xmath7 , generate variations in the gravitational potential , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath10 is the mean background mass density .",
    "conventionally , the matter density fluctuations are related to the fluctuations in galaxy counts by a linear biasing parameter , @xmath11 : @xmath12 since most of the lensing effects will be produced by fluctuations on large physical scales ( @xmath13mpc ) , the linear biasing model will hopefully be valid .",
    "it is important to note that detailed nonlinear and/or time - dependent biasing may somewhat change the statistics we present in this paper .",
    "a photon emitted at some angular position @xmath14 has been deflected by gravitational lensing during its long travel , with the result that it is observed at different angular position , @xmath15 .",
    "the photon angular excursion on celestial sphere is given by seljak ( 1994 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is transverse component of the potential gradient with respect to the photon path , @xmath18 is a projection operator on celestial sphere , and @xmath19 is unperturbed comoving radial distance corresponding to redshift @xmath20 at decoupling time . in equation ( [ eqn : pro ] ) , @xmath21 and sinh(u ) in",
    "a closed , flat , and open universe , respectively .",
    "next , we consider the relative angular excursion @xmath22 of a photon pair emitted from angular positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we restrict our calculation to the small angular separation limit , @xmath25 , and assume that the relative angular excursion @xmath22 obeys gaussian statistics .",
    "lensing is primarily due to scattering events from mass fluctuations on the 10 - 100 mpc scale .",
    "as there are 30 - 300 of these fluctuations between the surface of last scatter and the present along each photon path , the central limit theorem implies that this is a good approximation .",
    "following seljak ( 1994 ) , we characterize the statistics of the lensing fluctuations by its root - mean - square dispersion : @xmath26 ^ 2\\right\\rangle _",

    "the power spectrum of the potential fluctuations are related to the power spectrum of the density fluctuations through , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass density parameter given by @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the hubble parameter .",
    "figures 1a shows @xmath36 as functions of @xmath37 for several redshift values .",
    "we consider throughout this paper two cosmological models : one is the standard cdm ( scdm ) model with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and the other is a low - density , cosmological constant dominated cdm ( @xmath42cdm ) model with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the best fit model of ostriker and steinhardt ( 1995 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the present mass density and the present vacuum energy density normalized by the critical density ; @xmath49 is the present hubble parameter in units of @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is the mass fluctuations within a sphere of radius @xmath52 .",
    "we use the cobe normalized value ( @xcite ) for @xmath51 . in numerical calculation of @xmath53 ,",
    "we have used the fitting formula for cdm linear transfer function given in bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "the sdss project measures the redshift of galaxies up to @xmath54 within solid angle @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we expect to obtain photometric redshifts ( @xcite ) of galaxies up to @xmath56 with fairly small uncertainties .",
    "then we will obtain the galaxy number density perturbation , @xmath57 , within solid angle @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and for @xmath60 with some uncertainties due to error in photometric redshifts .",
    "we can see from figures 1b that the matter within @xmath59 , @xmath61 , and @xmath60 contributes 15% , 35% , and 55% , respectively , to the angular excursion from the last scattering surface .",
    "hereafter , the values with subscript @xmath62 denote the integral from the observer to some redshift @xmath63 , the edge of the survey data , and those with subscript @xmath64 denote the integral over remaining part ; for example : @xmath65 the total lensing deviation , @xmath66 its variance is the sum of the contribution from the two regions : @xmath67 for our purposes , the distant lensing is unimportant ; its only effect is to slightly reduce the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "gravitational lensing distorts the microwave background sky : @xmath68 = t\\left (    \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\psi $ } + \\delta \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\theta $ } \\right )    = t(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\psi $ } ) + \\delta \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\theta \\cdot    \\nabla $ } t ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\psi $ } ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\delta    \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\theta \\cdot \\nabla $ } \\right]^2 t\\left (    \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\psi $ } \\right ) + \\cdots .\\ ] ] here @xmath69 denotes the measured temperature map and @xmath1 denotes the unlensed temperature map .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the gravitational deflections are the sum of many small scattering due to superclusters and voids along the line - of - sight , we can treat @xmath84 as a gaussian random variable .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath85 is @xmath86 , where we have kept only the main isotropic term .",
    "the anisotropic term makes a subdominant contribution to the gravitational lensing effect on two - point auto - correlation function of cmb ( @xcite ) .",
    "though the anisotropic term is not too small in this statistics , the more rigorous analysis will be given in a subsequent paper ( @xcite ) .",

    "this effect is a small correction term , which we will ignore for the remainder of the paper .",
