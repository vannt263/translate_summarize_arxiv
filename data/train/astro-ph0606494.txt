    "the nucleus of ngc4395 is a `` dwarf '' type 1 seyfert active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , the least luminous known in its class @xcite .",
    "its presence in an essentially bulgeless , extremely late - type galaxy is surprising ; such agns ( and quiescent black holes ) are usually found in bulge - dominated early - type systems @xcite , with black hole mass and bulge mass strongly correlated @xcite . despite this , the nucleus of ngc4395 exhibits all of the hallmarks of a type 1 agn : it is detected as a variable x - ray point source @xcite , it has a high brightness temperature , highly compact radio core @xcite , and its spectral energy distribution from x - ray to radio wavelengths is similar to that of other type 1 agns @xcite .",
    "ngc4395 offers a chance to probe the low end of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass distribution .",
    "knowing the mass of the central object will help constrain the @xmath4 relation @xcite , which suggests a strong link between the growth of the smbh and evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "the smbh mass can be measured through emission - line reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "the relations of @xcite between continuum luminosity and radius of the broad - line region ( blr ) suggest that the size of the balmer line - emitting region in ngc4395 is of order light hours .",
    "we have used the reverberation method successfully in the ultraviolet ( uv ) with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to determine the size of the blr and the mass of the central object , measured to be @xmath5 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we present here simultaneous optical observations that complement the uv results .",
    "simultaneous x - ray observations with _ chandra _ are presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the observations and data reduction are outlined in section  [ sec : obs ] , while the data analysis is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "disc ] , we compare our results with those published for other agns and estimate the smbh mass .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "spectra were obtained on 2004 april 10 and 11 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope , using the kast spectrograph @xcite . the instrument separates blue and red light using a dichroic beamsplitter onto two @xmath6 pixel ccds ( optimized for blue or red light ) for simultaneous coverage .",
    "the pixel scale in the cross - dispersive direction is about @xmath7 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the blue - side grism gave a resolution of 1.83   pixel@xmath8 with an effective range of 32005400  , while the red - side grating was set to give a resolution of 1.17   pixel@xmath8 with an effective range of 53006800  .",
    "the slit width was 2 .",
    "sequences of 5 to 8 exposures of ngc4395 , each of duration 10 min , were bracketed by exposures of standard stars ( hz44 and feige 34 ; @xcite ) . the position angle ( pa ) of the slit",
    "was set to the average parallactic angle during each sequence to minimize differential light loss @xcite .    with blr variability expected on sub - hour timescales ,",
    "10-min exposures were necessary to maximize temporal coverage while maintaining a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the standard stars were used to monitor atmospheric extinction and obtain relative flux calibration ; absolute flux calibration of individual ngc4395 spectra was done via narrow emission lines ( expected to be constant in an agn ) .",
    "the weather was generally clear , though not photometric , with occasional thin clouds .",
    "conditions worsened slightly on the second night , with more cirrus clouds .",
    "typical seeing conditions were variable and ranged from @xmath9 to @xmath10 full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) .",
    "spectra were bias subtracted , flat fielded , and wavelength calibrated with standard iraf routines .",
    "wavelength calibration on the blue side was achieved with a hehgcd lamp ; the red side was calibrated with a near lamp .",
    "the extraction aperture was 4  along the cross - dispersive axis .",
    "spectra were then flux calibrated and extinction corrected with a standard star closely matching in airmass and time .",
    "on april 11 there was an electronic irregularity with the red - side ccd .",
    "several exposures were highly contaminated with a banding structure ( i.e. , entire pixel rows were forced to the same count level ) .",
    "this was eventually attributed to a loose connection inside the detector resulting in variable voltage .",
    "consequently , several red - side exposures on this night had to be discarded .",
    "unfortunately , it is likely that this irregularity was present in most exposures from both nights , albeit not at a level severe enough to notice readily .",
    "we touch upon this issue again in section  [ sec : disc : contvar ] .",
    "we also obtained simultaneous @xmath1-band observations with the 1-m nickel telescope and @xmath0-band observations with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; @xcite ) on both nights .",
    "the nickel ccd was used in 2@xmath112 binned mode , resulting in a @xmath12 pixel detector with a pixel scale of @xmath13 pixel@xmath8 , along with 5 min exposures .",
    "the nickel data were bias subtracted automatically and flat fielded using standard iraf routines .",
    "kait uses a back - illuminated apogee @xmath14 pixel ccd with a @xmath7 pixel@xmath8 scale .",
    "we used 4 min exposures .",
    "the kait data were reduced automatically as described by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-band observations were obtained on 2004 april 910 and 1011 , and on 2004 july 3 , with the wise observatory 1-m telescope in israel , using a back - illuminated tektronix @xmath12 pixel ccd .",
    "the image scale was @xmath15 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the nucleus was positioned on the northwest corner of the chip to maximize the number of relatively bright reference stars included in the field .",
    "exposures of 262 s each were obtained about once per 5 min .",
    "one exposure in the @xmath1 band was also obtained for the purpose of measuring the colors of the stars in the field .",
    "observations were carried out each night from the start of the night until the airmass of ngc4395 exceeded @xmath16 .",
    "typical image quality was 23@xmath17 fwhm , deteriorating toward the end of each night at high airmass .",
    "standard debiasing and flat fielding were performed .",
    "spectroscopic observations at the kpno mayall 4-m telescope were obtained on 2004 april 10 and 11 .",
    "we used the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph with the kpc-17b grating ( 527 l mm@xmath8 ) and the tek2 kb detector .",
    "observations with this setup covered the range of about 41007300   with a resolution of 4.2   .",
    "we obtained only 6 and 16 exposures of 5 min duration on april 10 and 11 , respectively , a result of rain .",
    "we elect to present only the april 11 data , which consist of a longer , nearly uninterrupted span of observations .",
    "the weather for the april 11 data was clear ( nearly photometric ) until dawn .",
    "the observation and calibration method we used is the same as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method achieves spectrophotometric calibration by rotating the long spectrograph slit to the appropriate position angle ( pa ) so that a nearby comparison star is observed simultaneously with the object .",
    "the comparison star we used is located at a pa of 51  relative to the nucleus of ngc4395 and at a distance of 33@xmath17 ( star 1 in figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "we used a slit width of 2@xmath17 .",
    "this pa is only 10  off the parallactic angle for this object at high airmass ( @xmath16 ) , and since the meridian transit occurs near the zenith , atmospheric dispersion losses for most of the night are small",
    ". we also used the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( i.e. , risley prisms ) to minimize the dispersion losses at this nonparallactic position angle .",
    "we expand upon this issue in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced using standard iraf routines , and for each exposure we obtained an agn / star flux - ratio spectrum .",
    "these spectra were compared to each other to enable cleaning of cosmic - ray events .",
    "the spectra were calibrated to an absolute flux level using observations of the spectrophotometric standard star hz44 taken adjacent to the observations of ngc4395 .",
    "although the absolute flux calibration has an uncertainty of @xmath1810% , the relative calibration accuracy between the observations is about 1% ( confirmed using the  line fluxes ) .",
    "for the kait and nickel data , we examined the images to determine a fwhm for each night of observations , and found it to be roughly constant at @xmath184 pixels ( @xmath183 ) for kait and @xmath188 pixels ( @xmath183 ) for nickel .",
    "we chose an aperture with a radius set to this size and performed aperture photometry on the nucleus and nearby reference ( comparison ) stars .",
    "the sky was subtracted using a 5-pixel wide annulus with an inner radius 20 pixels from the center .",
    "we also attempted point - spread function ( psf ) photometry , but found the results very similar with a slight increase in noise , possibly due to the relatively faint reference stars , and decided to proceed with aperture photometry instead . to correct for extinction , non - photometric conditions , and variable seeing , we normalized the ngc4395 flux to those of stars 1 and 2 ( see figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "these stars were chosen for their proximity to the nucleus , their similar  colors , and overlap with the reference stars used in the analysis of the wise data . because of the relative photometry , the uncertainties in the photometry were estimated using the observed scatter of the reference stars .    for the wise data , we chose five stars , all brighter than the nucleus ( by 0.4 to 3.6 mag in @xmath0 ) , with  colors similar to that of the nucleus ( from 0.1 mag bluer to 0.3 mag redder ) , to serve as photometric reference stars ( see figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "aperture photometry within a fixed , 5-pixel ( 35 ) radius aperture was performed on the nucleus and on the stars , and the background level was determined and subtracted using a 5-pixel wide annulus separated by a 4-pixel interval from the central aperture .",
    "this separation is sufficient to exclude the wings of the psf in the sky annulus .",
    "the photometric zero point of every exposure was found by taking , for each star , the instrumental magnitude difference between the exposure and the first epoch of the night , and calculating the mean difference for all five stars .",
    "the light curve of each star , relative to the zero point determined by the remaining four stars , was examined and verified to be constant , and its root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuations were noted ; these provide an empirical estimate of the accuracy of the photometry .",
    "outlier points in each star s light curve were then excluded .",
    "the mean of each star s magnitude was subtracted from its light curve , to avoid any dependence on the zero point of the flux at the first epoch .",
    "finally , the photometric zero point based on the five stars was recalculated , and used to calibrate the measurements of the nucleus .",
    "we used the sum of the fluxes from the common reference stars 1 and 2 ( figure  [ fig : field ] ) to normalize the light curves from all three telescopes .",
    "photometric accuracy , based on the reference stars , is generally better than 12% , except toward the end of each night , when the high airmass starts to have an effect . to obtain an absolute flux scale",
    ", we used the sloan digital sky survey skyserver to retrieve @xmath19 and @xmath20 magnitudes for stars 1 and 2 .",
    "the corresponding calibrated @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes were then found using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : phot ] and  [ fig : wise3 ] show the various light curves of the ngc4395 nucleus ( reproduced in table  [ tab : photflux ] ) and the reference stars .",
    "intra - night variability was greatest during the first night of wise observations .",
    "table  [ tab : photvar ] lists variability parameters for these light curves .",
    "the excess variance @xmath21 is as described by @xcite and represents the measured variance above the noise , @xmath22 is the maximum - to - minimum flux ratio , and @xmath23 is simply the peak - to - valley amplitude divided by the unweighted mean of the night .",
    "on april 10 , ngc4395 was observed for 1.5 hours longer from kait than from the nickel telescope , when there was a sharp decline in brightness .",
    "it is for this reason that kait exhibits a greater @xmath21 on april 10 than nickel , even though variability is generally more pronounced toward bluer colors for typical seyferts .",
    "april 11 , with equal kait / nickel coverage , is a better indicator of relative @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band variability .",
    "figure  [ fig : wise3 ] shows the 2004 july 3 observations ( corresponding to _ hst _ visit 3 from paper i ) from wise observatory .",
    "ngc4395 was only observed for 2 hours , before it was too low in the sky .",
    "consequently , it is unclear whether the low variation amplitude is intrinsic or the result of the short observing window .",
    "the nucleus was a factor of about 1.5 brighter in the @xmath0 band in july , to be compared to a factor of 3.4 in the uv ( paper i ) . in terms of",
    "the higher variation amplitude at shorter wavelengths during this time of increased activity , ngc4395 is once again behaving like a typical agn ( see section  [ sec : disc : contvar ] ) .",
    "the lick spectra were grouped according to blue / red side and night . within each group ,",
    "the spectra were cross - correlated against each other and rebinned to correct for slight wavelength solution discrepancies , to an accuracy of 0.1  .",
    "the spectra were then flux normalized according to strong narrow emission lines :  on the blue side , the sum of  and  ( equally weighted ) on the red side . since the red and blue sides have a very small overlap region , which is compromised by dichroic light loss , it was not possible to calibrate the red side to the blue side . to remedy this",
    ", we used complete kpno spectra to determine a mean /(+ ) ratio , and applied this to the lick spectra to calibrate the red side to the blue side .",
    "the narrow - line flux normalization provided good relative calibration , but the absolute flux calibration of kpno data was superior .",
    "we therefore used the  flux to adjust the lick data to the absolute scale of the kpno data .",
    "we then obtained flux measurements of , , , , and the individual  lines as a means to examine the behavior of the spectra and the scatter of the narrow lines .",
    "the resolution on the blue side is sufficient to completely separate both  lines .",
    "the continuum for each line was determined by averaging the continuum on either side of the line .",
    "each line is well separated and the continuum is very flat over such a short range in wavelength .",
    "all flux measurements , including those of narrow lines , were simple integrations from continuum - subtracted spectra . note that  also includes , a narrow and non - varying line .",
    "continuum measurements were obtained at 3650 , 4200 , 4550 , 5100 , 5625 , 6200 , and 6410  .",
    "they are median values over a small window typically 100   wide , except for 5100   which is 80   wide , 5625   which is 50   wide , and 6410   which is 40   wide .",
    "these windows have been verified to be featureless in a high s / n coadded spectrum , and are as large as possible to reduce the noise . despite this",
    ", the continuum light curves remain very noisy , especially towards shorter wavelengths , due to the low overall flux level .",
    "standard @xmath24 errors are calculated for each flux measurement ( which include poisson , readout noise , sky , flat - fielding , and calibration errors ) .",
    "since all spectra are normalized via narrow lines , which are assumed to be constant , there is potential for extra systematic errors .",
    "indeed , we find the rms scatter of , , , and  to be about 3 times greater than the formal @xmath24 errors , and so we adjust our measured errors by this factor to represent the true @xmath24 uncertainty in the data .    for consistency , we repeated the above line and continuum flux measurements with the kpno data ( except  and 3650  , which are outside the wavelength coverage ) .",
    "since those spectra were observed and reduced with a different strategy , this provided a good check on all our measurements .",
    "uncertainties were again estimated using the scatter of narrow lines , especially .",
    "figures  [ fig : lickcont1 ] and  [ fig : lickcont2 ] show continuum light curves from the lick and kpno data , while figures  [ fig : lines1 ] and  [ fig : lines2 ] show the measured light curves of emission lines .",
    "these are also reproduced in tables  [ tab : specflux ] and  [ tab : lineflux ] . in order to decrease the noise , continuum measurements",
    "have been paired and averaged , with 3650 omitted as it is very noisy .",
    "overall , continuum variability on april 10 is greater at bluer wavelengths , as expected , while april 11 exhibits optical variability that is less strongly dependent on wavelength .",
    "the agreement between the lick and kpno continuum light curves , despite the different observing strategies , is reassuring .",
    "the general consistency and stability of the narrow lines on april 10 indicates no obvious systematic effects , other than increased noise at higher airmass toward the end of the night .",
    "we note that  and  are mirror images of each other , since their sum was used to normalize the spectra .",
    "similarly ,  ( not shown ) is a mirror image of .",
    "on april 11 , the greater fluctuations of the narrow forbidden emission lines , especially on the red side (  and ) , are likely a result of slightly compromised electronics .",
    "weather was also generally worse than on april 10 , resulting in lower s / n data .",
    "kpno measurements are included in figure  [ fig : lines2 ] for comparison , with overall agreement between the two sets of data .",
    "the major exception is the  light curve , which shows substantially more variability in the lick data than in the kpno data .",
    "again , this is likely partially due to the electronics , with the lick errors underestimated as a result .",
    "table  [ tab : specvar ] lists the variability parameters of the variable emission lines from the lick data ; we omit the kpno data due to its short observing window .",
    "the narrow lines have @xmath25 by definition ( except for , which equals zero due to the noise ) , and exhibit rms scatter of @xmath181% for , @xmath182% for + , and @xmath186% for . for comparison ,",
    "the variability parameters of 1350   ( corresponding to _ hst _ visit 2 on april 11 , paper i ) and of the 0.48.0 kev x - rays ( corresponding to _",
    "chandra _ visits 1 and 2 on april 10 and 11 , paper ii ) are also included .",
    "for the x - rays , we use 300 s bins and the full duration of each observation ( @xmath1830 ks ) in order to have similar time - scale ranges .",
    "we detect marginal variability in the lines of interest with broad components .",
    "the april 11  variability is likely overestimated , again a result of the electronic difficulties .",
    "we detect significant continuum variability above the noise , which declines toward the red .",
    "this is consistent with photometric results from april 11 ( with equal kait / nickel coverage ) .",
    "the 3650   light curve is highly noisy , and no variability above the noise is detected on april 11 .",
    "it is possible that the non - parallactic kpno observations ( and subsequent lick blue - side / red - side calibration using kpno data ) introduced a wavelength - dependent error , but we estimate such atmospheric dispersion losses to be minimal given the slit width and pa used .",
    "the use of risley prisms also minimizes such dispersion losses .",
    "inspection of the /(+ ) ratio in the kpno data revealed only a @xmath184% discrepancy near the end of the observations , at high airmass .",
    "we did not use these data points , however , in obtaining a mean ratio to calibrate the blue and red sides of the lick spectra . even if dispersion - related errors persist",
    ", we note that this will not affect our measured @xmath21 values , as both the flux and flux error will be erroneous by the same factor .",
    "only the relative scaling between the blue - side and red - side optical continua , seen in figures  [ fig : lickcont1 ] and  [ fig : lickcont2 ] , could be affected by such errors .",
    "we plot @xmath21 as a function of wavelength in figure  [ fig : fvar ] .",
    "we note that @xmath21 represents measured variability above the noise .",
    "for instance , the lick continuum @xmath21 values with smaller windows ( 5100 , 5625 , and 6410  ) are somewhat lower than their neighbors as a result of higher noise .",
    "recall also that the nickel data on april 10 span a shorter time than either the kait or the lick 3-m data .",
    "what is clear from figure  [ fig : fvar ] is the _ broad _ trend of increased variability with decreasing wavelength , the obviously lower variability on april 11 , and the shallower dependence on wavelength on april 11 .",
    "these @xmath21 measurements are consistent with the general continuum light curve shapes from figures  [ fig : lickcont1 ] and  [ fig : lickcont2 ] and with the broad trend in spectral slope ( i.e. , the slope of the continuum ) .",
    "it is quite clear that april 10 exhibits a steepening of the slope with increasing flux ( and thus shorter wavelengths have greater variability ) , whereas on april 11 the slope is nearly constant and a weak function of total flux .",
    "this also agrees with the photometric @xmath26 ( though on april 10 , the nickel data do not cover the sharp decline in flux at the end of the night , and therefore strong changes in @xmath26 can not be seen ) . as the continuum light curves are very noisy , however , especially at short wavelengths , we do not attempt to characterize the spectral slope any further .    figures  [ fig : lickkaitnick1 ] and  [ fig : lickkaitnick2 ] show a comparison between kait , nickel , and lick 3-m spectroscopic `` broad - band '' light curves . for this purpose , lick spectra were passed through two filter functions and integrated in order to mimic @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band observations ( table  [ tab : specsimflux ] ) .",
    "the sharp rise in uv luminosity on april 11 ( figure 1 from paper i ) is far more subdued in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "there is overall agreement between the two @xmath1-band and @xmath0-band data sets to within @xmath18510% .",
    "there exists an odd discrepancy , however , between the lick spectroscopic `` broad - band '' light curves and the photometric light curves for a short period on both nights ( jd2453105 , 0.780.85 and 1.801.87 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is mirrored in the individual spectroscopic continuum light curves from figures  [ fig : lickcont1 ] and  [ fig : lickcont2 ] .",
    "these occur while ngc4395 crosses the meridian , and correspond to a distinct subgroup of observations on both nights .",
    "the discrepancy is not due to contamination from an  region as the slit rotated over the nucleus , because extra line flux would cause a _",
    "lower _ continuum with our normalization .",
    "line intensity ratios , such as / , also remain constant throughout the night .",
    "galaxy contamination is not the source either , because ( a ) the galactic stellar light is very symmetrical about the nucleus , and ( b ) galactic stellar light is almost nonexistent in this bulgeless system @xcite .",
    "we also re - reduced the suspect data with a different standard star ( with similar airmass ) and saw little change . comparing the calibration coefficients between lick and kait data ( which have nearly identical weather )",
    "suggests that the narrow emission - line calibration is indeed at fault , and not extra continuum light .",
    "the cause of this calibration anomaly is unknown .",
    "as noted previously , however , an electronic irregularity forced us to discard several red - side images on april 11 .",
    "this problem occurred only near transit , when the position of the telescope was such as to cause the greatest disruption with the loose cable .",
    "since the suspect data occur near transit , it is possible that this discrepancy is the result of a subtle electronic glitch affecting both ccds , though this is only speculation .",
    "whatever the cause , we caution the reader about any continuum measurements from the lick data during these short periods of time .",
    "our optical observations were carried out simultaneously with _ hst _",
    "stis observations as described in paper i and with _",
    "acis - s observations which are described in paper ii .",
    "unfortunately , during the night of april 10 , _ hst _ observations were acquired under gyro control which degraded the photometric accuracy , rendering these observations useless for our purposes .",
    "we used the april 11 observations along with the two _ chandra _ observations for a cross - correlation analysis with the optical observations .",
    "the light curves used in this analysis are presented in figure  [ fig : multilc ] .",
    "we refer to the observations of 2004 april 10 and 11 as visit 1 and visit 2 , respectively , to be consistent with papers i and ii .    in the following we use two cross - correlation methods : the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the z - transform discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of @xcite which is an improvement over the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; @xcite )",
    ". transformation to the correlation coefficients , and uses equal population bins rather than the equal time bins used in the dcf . ]    to calculate the uncertainties in the cross - correlation lag determination we used the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method of @xcite . in this method , each monte carlo simulation consists of two parts .",
    "the first is a `` random subset selection '' ( rss ) procedure which consists of randomly resampling a new light curve of @xmath27 points from the original light curve of @xmath27 points , without regard to whether a particular point has been selected previously .",
    "thus some points are selected multiple times and others are not selected at all .",
    "the uncertainty of a single point that is selected @xmath28 times is decreased by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "the second part is `` flux randomization '' ( fr ) in which the observed fluxes are altered by random gaussian deviates scaled to the uncertainty ascribed to each point .",
    "the two resampled and altered time series are then cross - correlated using the iccf method and the centroid of the ccf is computed .",
    "we used @xmath1810000 monte carlo realizations to build up a cross - correlation centroid distribution ( cccd ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mean of the distribution is taken to be the time lag and the uncertainty is determined by the range which contains 68% of the monte carlo realizations in the cccd and thus would correspond to 1@xmath30 uncertainties for a normal distribution .",
    "cross - correlation functions of the emission - line light curves from figures  [ fig : lines1 ] and  [ fig : lines2 ] with the @xmath0-band continuum light curve ( figure  [ fig : multilc]b ) are presented in figure  [ fig : lineccfs ] . in each case , the emission - line and @xmath0-band light curves from both nights are combined into one .",
    "the cross - correlation of the  line light curve yields a time lag of the line behind the continuum of @xmath31  d ( figure  [ fig : lineccfs]a ) , though @xmath1810% of the fr / rss monte carlo simulations failed to yield successful centroid calculations as no well - defined peak was found .",
    "we note that the electronic difficulties on the red side exaggerate the  variations but leave the overall shape intact .",
    "the cross - correlation of the  line light curve yields a very shallow peak using the zdcf method and no peak at all when using the iccf method ( figure  [ fig : lineccfs]b ) .",
    "indeed @xmath1880% of the fr / rss monte carlo simulations failed to yield successful centroid calculations .",
    "the @xmath1820% successful simulations yield a time lag of the line behind the continuum of @xmath32 d. the cross - correlation the  line light curve has a more clearly defined peak than for  though here also @xmath1840% of the fr / rss monte carlo simulations failed to yield successful centroid calculations .",
    "the @xmath1860% successful simulations yield a time lag of the line behind the continuum of @xmath33 d ( figure  [ fig : lineccfs]c ) .",
    "the fr / rss monte carlo simulations for the  line failed in @xmath1870% cases , again indicating that the ccf does not have a well - defined peak .",
    "the @xmath1830% successful simulations yield a time lag of the line behind the continuum of @xmath34 d ( figure  [ fig : lineccfs]d ) .",
    "we repeated the above cross - correlations with the emission - line light curves without the problem transit points described in section  [ sec : spec ] , to check for any possible systematic errors .",
    "our results were consistent , with any variation clearly within the noise of our simulations , and so we proceeded with our original cross - correlations above .",
    "this provides assurance that the problems associated with the anomalous continuum measurements during transit are not propagated to the emission - line light curves .",
    "we note that the iccfs and zdcfs presented in figure  [ fig : lineccfs ] are only loosely consistent with each other .",
    "in particular , the  line ( figure  [ fig : lineccfs]b ) exhibits the greatest difference between the two correlation methods . this arises because of the very small variation amplitude in the underlying light curves and the fact that there is a large gap between the two nights .",
    "this gap is interpolated over when using the iccf method , which produces some extra correlation that distorts the iccf from the zdcf .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in this case , the zdcf is a better representation of the true ccf .",
    "since the correlations and the time lags are of very low significance , however , and are only suggestive , we did not investigate this issue further .",
    "the ccfs in figure  [ fig : ccfs ] do not show this problem because the underlying light curves have higher variation amplitudes .",
    "all ccfs presented in figure  [ fig : lineccfs ] therefore have some , but not very significant , indication of a positive time lag behind the optical continuum .",
    "although individual results are either consistent with zero or of low significance , the trend as a whole is quite suggestive . in particular",
    ", the average lag of the balmer emission lines is about @xmath35 d , or @xmath36 min .",
    "this time lag , though highly uncertain , is about a factor of 1.5 larger than the time lag found for the  line in paper i. it is also consistent with the @xmath37-luminosity relations of @xcite , which suggest that the balmer line - emitting region is of order light hours in radius in ngc4395 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ccfs ] we present the cross - correlation functions of the @xmath1-band , uv , and x - ray light curves with the optical @xmath0-band light curve .",
    "note that a negative time lag implies the @xmath0-band light curve is lagging behind the other reference light curve .",
    "no formal time lag is detected between the @xmath1-band and @xmath0-band light curves , with a ccf centroid of @xmath38 d ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]a ) .",
    "our results suggest a time lag between the uv and optical light curves of @xmath39 d ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]b ) . within the 1@xmath30 uncertainty quoted here",
    "this is not consistent with zero time lag and implies the optical emission is lagging behind the uv emission by @xmath2 min .    for the cross - correlation of the x - ray and optical light curves",
    ", we first used each of the two x - ray visits alone with the simultaneous optical ( kait ) observations and then cross - correlated both visits as one light curve with the corresponding optical light curve .",
    "these ccfs are presented in figures  [ fig : ccfs]c  e .",
    "cross - correlating only the x - ray light curve from visit 1 with the optical light curve yields a time lag of @xmath40 d ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]c ) .",
    "cross - correlating only the x - ray light curve from visit 2 with the optical light curve yields a time lag of @xmath41 d ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]d ) .",
    "cross - correlating the x - ray light curve from both visits with the optical light curve yields a time lag of @xmath42 d ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]e ) .",
    "we note that due to the shape of the optical light curve during visit 1 , being generally monotonically decreasing , the peak seen in the cross - correlation with the x - ray data ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]c ) is shallow and broad . in visit 2 more structure is seen in the optical light curve , resulting in a somewhat better defined peak when cross - correlating the light curves ( figure  [ fig : ccfs]d ) . the strong and fast variations evident in the x - ray data are not seen in the optical light curve , which also causes the peak cross - correlation coefficient to be relatively small ( of order 0.30.4 ) .",
    "thus the cross - correlation is more an indication of the general trend of the optical light curve seen in the x - ray light curve .",
    "we also note that the average optical flux during visit 2 was higher than in visit 1 , but in x - rays both visits have about the same flux .",
    "this contributes to the very small peak correlation coefficient seen in figure  [ fig : ccfs]e , when cross - correlating the data from both visits at once .",
    "nevertheless , even with the small correlation coefficients , by simply averaging the above three results we can determine that the optical continuum is lagging the x - ray continuum by about @xmath43 d , or @xmath3 min .",
    "cross - correlation of the x - ray light curve with the uv light curve is presented in paper ii , where the time lag is found to be @xmath44 d , consistent with zero lag , with a 95% upper limit of roughly @xmath45 d , or @xmath46 hour .",
    "we note that the reason for not being able to firmly determine a time lag between the uv and the x - rays is probably because these light curves do not overlap at the end of visit 2 .",
    "thus the strong decrease seen at the end of the uv light curve is not seen in the x - ray light curve .",
    "this prevents us from significantly determining a time lag .",
    "the large gaps in the uv light curve due to the _ hst _ orbit also diminish the possibility of a firm determination of the lag .    finally , as a consistency check on our observations , we performed cross - correlations between the lick continuum `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath0 '' light curves ( figures  [ fig : lickcont1 ] and  [ fig : lickcont2 ] ) with the simultaneous photometric @xmath1-band and @xmath0-band light curves ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "the bad transit points were removed prior to our calculations . in every case but one ,",
    "the ccfs were clearly peaked at zero lag ( as expected ) with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 .",
    "the one exception was the @xmath0-band correlation on april 10 .",
    "the ccf was very broad and flat , but this is easily understood given the gradually , monotonically decreasing light curve in the @xmath0 band . by comparison ,",
    "the @xmath1 band exhibits more structure , and so a lag is more easily computed .",
    "we also performed cross - correlations between the spectroscopically derived broad - band light curves from figures  [ fig : lickkaitnick1 ] and  [ fig : lickkaitnick2 ] with their corresponding photometric light curves .",
    "the transit points were again removed .",
    "we consider these derived broad - band light curves a much better indicator of the spectroscopic data quality than the individual continuum light curves , because far more flux enters the simulated band pass , increasing the s / n . once again",
    ", three of the four correlations were clearly consistent with zero lag , with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 .",
    "the exception was again the @xmath0-band light curve on april 10 .",
    "for the same reasons as above , this ccf was very broad and flat and therefore easily understood .",
    "while the lick spectroscopic data are very noisy , especially in the continuum , these cross - correlation checks above are reassuring . combined with the kpno light curves at the end of april 11",
    ", we feel confident about the consistency between the various spectroscopic and photometric data sets , and with all our cross - correlations above .",
    "continuum variations in agns are generally more pronounced at shorter wavelengths than at longer ones .",
    "this is detected in the photometry of ngc4395 , especially between the kait and nickel data on april 11 .",
    "we see it in the spectra as well , with all variability parameters increasing from 6410    to 3650   .",
    "this trend continues into the uv at 1350    ( paper i ) and into the 0.48.0 kev x - rays ( paper ii ) .",
    "finally , the overall continuum level shows a larger rise in the uv than in the optical over the course of three months , from april 11 to july 3 ; the @xmath0-band brightness was 1.5 times larger while the uv was 3.4 times larger .",
    "these variability results are in agreement with the broad picture of agn variability @xcite",
    ". previous studies of ngc4395 , for instance , revealed the continuum level varying by a factor of @xmath182.2 at 3800    over six months , as compared to a factor of @xmath181.3 at 6800  @xcite . in ngc3783 ,",
    "@xcite report a value of @xmath22 that nearly doubles from 2700    to 1460   . in ngc4151",
    ", @xcite found continuum variations of 17%35% ( @xmath47 ) , increasing from 6925    to 4600   .",
    "the trend continues into the near - uv and far - uv .",
    "@xcite also measured @xmath21 values of 24% , 9% , 5% , 4% , and 1% in the x - ray , at 1275  , 1820  , 2688  , and 5125  , respectively . in ngc5548 , one of the best - studied agns to date , @xcite found @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be greatly increasing from 5100   to 1145 during a simultaneous observing campaign . @xcite found @xmath21 to nearly double from the @xmath48 band to the @xmath1 band in 3c390.3 .",
    "@xcite analyzed @xmath1-band and @xmath49-band light curves of 42 pg quasars observed during @xmath18 3060 epochs over 7 years .",
    "they found a rms variability amplitude of 14% in @xmath1 vs. 12% in @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore the majority of the quasars , and particularly those that were the most variable , were significantly bluer when they were brighter .",
    "for example , in all quasars that varied by @xmath50  mag , @xmath51 was significantly larger than the corresponding @xmath52 .",
    "as another comparison , @xcite find significant continuum variability in ngc4395 of @xmath1835% over the course of 3 nights in 1998 .",
    "they also find marginal evidence for greater variability in the blue continuum than in the red .",
    "our results appear to be consistent , if at a lower variability amplitude .",
    "@xcite also attempted to detect , without success , variability in broad  by decomposing the line into narrow and broad gaussian components .",
    "we initially attempted the same procedure in all of the lines , in order to isolate the highly variable broad component , but found the results too unreliable .",
    "a gaussian model with one or two components ( or four in the case of the  complex ) is simply an approximation , especially for the broad lines , that may not be uniquely fit .",
    "we indeed found some slight inverse correlations between various model components , suggesting an unstable solution to the line profile as a function of time .",
    "for this reason we abandoned this method and proceeded with straightforward line integration of all the lines , including single - component narrow lines .",
    "this method unfortunately includes non - varying narrow - line flux in the measurement , diminishing the variability amplitude , but is far more reliable .",
    "our optical spectroscopy shows hints of a positive lag of the balmer emission lines behind the optical continuum .",
    "the lag is consistent with being roughly a factor of 1.5 longer than for the uv lines and the uv continuum .",
    "this is expected , as in most objects studied thus far the time lag for the uv lines ( particularly ly@xmath53 ) was always smaller than that found for the balmer lines , by a factor of about two ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in previous multiwavelength monitoring campaigns of agns , the temporal resolutions were typically insufficient to detect any time lag between x - ray , uv , and optical continuum variations .",
    "indeed , in ngc4151 , @xcite place an upper limit of any x - ray / uv / optical interband delay of 0.15  d , while @xcite detect no evidence of a uv - optical continuum lag .",
    "@xcite find significant evidence for correlated x - ray / optical emission with zero lag ( within 1 d ) in ngc4051 , though their results suggest a very complex relationship between x - ray and optical emission , one that is not simple reprocessing .",
    "in the same system , @xcite also find evidence for correlated x - ray / optical emission , but again the time resolution of their experiment is insufficient to determine a lag of order days or less . with a resolution of @xmath181  d ,",
    "@xcite find no significant lag between the uv and optical continua in ngc5548 .",
    "a reanalysis of earlier data results in no uv - optical lag for ngc5548 , ngc3783 , and fairall 9 , while in ngc7469 there is a uv - optical lag of @xmath1812  d @xcite .",
    "some experiments were successful at measuring an interband delay .",
    "for instance , in ngc4051 , @xcite detect the uv emission lagging the x - rays by 0.14  d. in ark564 , @xcite detect the uv continuum lagging the x - rays by @xmath180.4  d , the optical lagging the uv by @xmath181.8  d , and the optical lagging the x - rays by @xmath182  d ( though in general the optical and x - ray light curves are not strongly correlated ) , all consistent with reprocessing models .",
    "by contrast , no correlations at any lag between optical , uv , and x - ray bands in ngc3516 were found , arguing against the reprocessing model in this case @xcite .",
    "our results are quite similar , although with large uncertainties , with a uv - optical lag of @xmath2 min and a x - ray - optical lag of @xmath3 min .",
    "a high sampling frequency ( @xmath185 min observations for optical , 200  s for uv , 300  s bins for x - rays ) has allowed us to make these sub - hour lag measurements .",
    "the @xmath1-band and @xmath0-band correlation is consistent with zero , though it hints at a possible @xmath0-band lag behind the @xmath1-band .",
    "given the proximity of these two bands , a formal lag of zero is not surprising .",
    "although no formal lag was detected between the uv and x - ray light curves , the fact that the optical continuum lags the x - ray continuum more than the uv continuum is consistent with the idea of x - ray photons being reprocessed into uv and then optical photons .",
    "the difference between the x - ray - optical lag and the uv - optical lag is also well within the 95% upper limit of @xmath46 hour for the x - ray - uv lag established in paper ii .",
    "we can further examine the validity of this model by estimating the energies of the variable components in the three bands .",
    "if the x - rays are indeed the driving force behind uv and optical ( @xmath0 ) variability , then we must require @xmath54 for the model to be energetically reasonable .",
    "in paper ii we determined the monochromatic flux variability during visit 2 was @xmath55  at both 1350   and 1 kev , using the root of the unnormalized excess variance ( i.e. , @xmath21 times the mean ) . for the @xmath0 band ,",
    "the unnormalized excess variance is roughly @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to a monochromatic flux variability at 5500   of @xmath57 , which satisfies our energy requirement .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this model for continuum variability extends into the near - infrared @xmath58 bands .",
    "@xcite provide evidence of near - infrared intraday variability in ngc4395 which is correlated with simultaneous @xmath0-band observations .",
    "furthermore , the near - infrared light curves lag behind the @xmath0-band light curve by @xmath59 min , which although consistent with zero lag , hints at a possible short duration lag , similar to the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands in this paper .      unfortunately , due to the very low activity level , low variability amplitude , severe depletion of broad - line flux , and high corresponding noise in the light curves , we are unable to make a significant reverberation - based mass measurement of the smbh in ngc4395 to compare with the uv reverberation - based mass of @xmath60 from paper i. the emission - line light curves for the `` variable '' lines failed to produce significant time lags behind the continuum light curve , as described in section  [ sec : xcor ] .",
    "we are also unable to verify the blr radius vs. luminosity relationship determined in paper i.    the lack of significant variability can be seen in the rms spectra ( figures  [ fig : rmsb ] and  [ fig : rmsr ] )",
    ".  completely disappears in the rms spectra , and broad  is very weak .",
    "the variability in the narrow lines is a result of variable seeing .",
    "since the narrow lines are not spectrally resolved by the instrument and the seeing disk is smaller than the slit width , changes in seeing will alter the line shape as a function of time , while keeping the total integrated flux constant . because the resolution of the setup we used with the lick kast spectrograph is higher on the red side than on the blue side",
    ", these line - shape variations are more prominent in the red - side rms spectra .",
    "( on the red side , the noise induced by the compromised electronics might also be responsible for the slightly increased rms signal in the narrow lines . )",
    "the broad lines are fully resolved , however , so any variability seen in the rms spectra is intrinsic .",
    "the broad component of  is diminished and the broad  practically disappears in the rms spectra . at earlier epochs ,",
    "the broad  component was strong and very broad ; it was a prime candidate for reverberation mapping .",
    "as a qualitative comparison , figure  [ fig : epochs ] shows a composite spectrum from 2004 april 10 ( total exposure time is 6.58 hours ) compared with a single 20-min exposure taken on 2003 june 8 , both from the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "the blr is noticeably reduced during the low level of activity in the 2004 data , as is the continuum flux .",
    "the two spectra show similar s / n despite the large difference in exposure times , highlighting the low flux level in the 2004 data .",
    "it should be noted that the 2003 data were taken with a 4  slit , though as this is an essentially bulgeless system , there should be insignificant host - galaxy stellar light @xcite .",
    "still , our data do show hints of a possible emission - line lag of @xmath36 min , and it is constructive to make a rough estimate of the mass of the smbh , to compare with the value derived in paper i. we estimate the fwhm of the `` variable '' or broad part of , the line exhibiting the greatest variability , to be @xmath61    ( or @xmath62 km s@xmath8 ) . while the amplitude of the variability may be suspect due to the electronic difficulties , the lag itself has the greatest significance . here",
    "we assume that the fwhm @xmath63 for the broad  line , as was found for the broad line in rms spectra ( table 4 in paper i ) . while this is a poor approximation for a pure gaussian line , the broad lines are not strictly gaussian .",
    "the mass of the smbh is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the speed of light , @xmath66 the gravitational constant , and @xmath67 is a scale factor that depends on the unknown geometry and kinematics of the broad - line region . to be consistent with paper i",
    ", we use the value found empirically by @xcite of @xmath68 . using @xmath69 min ,",
    "we therefore find @xmath70 , which is consistent with our results from paper i. we stress again that this is simply a qualitative comparison , as our data are of insufficient quality to provide a significant black hole mass determination .",
    "we observed ngc4395 , the least luminous known seyfert 1 galaxy , from five different ground - based optical telescopes over the course of 2 nights in 2004 april , as part of a coordinated multiwavelength reverberation - mapping campaign designed to measure the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the results of our observations are as follows .    1 .",
    "ngc4395 was in a very low state of activity during this period , with optical continuum flux levels , variability amplitudes , and broad emission - line fluxes all diminished compared with earlier epochs .",
    "2 .   despite this",
    ", we detect intrinsic continuum variability , from both spectra and broad - band photometry , ranging from about 2% to 10% ( @xmath21 ) . in general",
    ", we clearly see evidence for increased variability toward shorter wavelengths , consistent with other typical agns .",
    "this trend extends into the simultaneous uv and x - ray bands .",
    "the overall shape of the optical continuum light curves agrees with the simultaneous uv and x - ray light curves .",
    "variability was greatest on april 10 , while april 11 exhibited a slightly shallower dependence of variability on wavelength .",
    "cross - correlation of the various continuum light curves suggests that the optical emission lags behind the uv emission by @xmath2 min , and the optical emission lags behind the x - ray emission by @xmath3 min .",
    "there is no formal detection of any lag between the uv and x - ray emission , as described in paper ii , and between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "these results are consistent with the reprocessing model , in which x - ray photons are reprocessed into uv and optical photons .",
    "our high sampling frequency has allowed us to make these measurements , which have previously been very difficult to achieve .",
    "4 .   we only formally detect a lag between the  light curve and the @xmath0-band light curve .",
    "although all other emission - line light curves are consistent with zero lag , the trend as a whole is quite suggestive .",
    "in particular , averaging the balmer - line correlations with the optical continuum yields an emission - line lag of @xmath36 min behind the continuum . while not very significant , this result is consistent with the relations of @xcite for the size of the blr .",
    "the optical emission - line lag is also about 1.5 times larger than the uv emission - line lag behind the uv continuum .",
    "we have seen this behavior in other agns , which indicates ngc4395 is behaving typically , albeit faintly , for an agn .",
    "5 .   using the balmer emission - line lag and the fwhm of the variable broad - line region",
    ", we estimate the mass of the smbh to be @xmath71 . again , this measurement is not very significant , and is meant only to compare with the value of @xmath5 derived in paper i. the results are consistent .",

    "<S> we present optical observations of the low - luminosity seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc4395 , as part of a multiwavelength reverberation - mapping program . </S>",
    "<S> observations were carried out over two nights in 2004 april at lick , wise , and kitt peak observatories . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band photometry , and spectra over the range 35006800  . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> uv and _ chandra _ x - ray observations are presented in companion papers . </S>",
    "<S> even though ngc4395 was in an extremely low state of activity , we detect significant continuum variability of 210% , increasing toward shorter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum light curves , both spectroscopic and photometric , are qualitatively similar to the simultaneous uv and x - ray light curves . </S>",
    "<S> inter - band cross - correlations suggest that the optical continuum emission lags behind the uv continuum emission by @xmath2 min , and that the optical continuum emission lags behind the x - ray continuum emission by @xmath3 min , consistent with a reprocessing model for active galactic nucleus emission . </S>",
    "<S> there are also hints of balmer emission lines lagging behind the optical continuum by an amount slightly larger than the emission - line lag detected in the uv . </S>",
    "<S> these results are all similar to those of other seyfert 1 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the emission - line lag yields a mass measurement of the central black hole , which although not very significant , is consistent with the value derived from the simultaneous uv data . </S>"
