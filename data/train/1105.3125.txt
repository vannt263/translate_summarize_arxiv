    "we note , however , that the cdfs derived from the observations do not follow an evolution as regular as expected from the models .",
    "the @xmath3 persei cdf , in particular , displays a sharp rise at short rotation periods due to an excess of fast and ultra - fast rotators .",

    ", the maximum angular velocity is expected at about the tuc - hor / col / car age , i.e. , @xmath88  myr ( see also figures [ fig : ev_2val ] and [ fig : ev_plaw ] ) . however , this is not observed because the evolution from the tuc - hor / col / car age ( 30 myr ) to @xmath3 persei ( 70 myr ) appears consistent with a continuation of the spin - up after the zams .",
    "the spin - up of fast and ultra - fast rotators from the tuc - hor / col / car age ( 30 myr ) to the @xmath3 persei ( 70 myr ) age seems even faster than for slower rotators . in the dzm framework , such a behaviour can not be reproduced unless , for the fast and ultra - fast rotators , a remarkable amount of angular momentum is transferred from the core to the envelope within a very short timescale ( @xmath89  myr ) . in this case , however , very little angular momentum would be left in the core for the later evolution .",
    "after the peak in the angular velocity , a generally monotonic spin - down is expected . the fast rotator excess in m  34 ( 220 myr ) and m  11 ( 230  myr )",
    ", however , hampers the possibility of obtaining a satisfactory fit at all ages .",
    "in fact , the percentage of observed fast rotators ( @xmath90 1 - 2 d ) tends to decrease from @xmath3 per to m  35 , but then increases abruptly in m  34 and m  11 .",
    "such a distribution evolution is clearly inconsistent with the dzm alone .    despite such limitations , which will be discussed in some more details in sect.[sec : disc ] , the power - law @xmath0 model produces a more satisfactory fit to the data , particularly since it reproduces the shape of most of the observed cdfs also giving a high @xmath79 value for ab dor / pleaides and m  37 .",
    "it requires , however , an alternative explanation for the excess of fast and ultra - fast rotators in @xmath3 per , m  34 , and m  11 .            two rotational tracks , with initial conditions representative of slow ( @xmath91 ) and fast rotators ( @xmath92 ) , as calculated with the dzm and prescriptions or for @xmath0 , are compared with the observed distributions and the solar - age angular velocity in figures [ fig : ev_2val ] and [ fig : ev_plaw ] , respectively . assigning a constant value to @xmath0 for the whole rotational evolution results in slow and fast tracks that intersect with each other at ages later than about @xmath74 gyr ( see figure [ fig : ev_2val ] ) .",
    "this is another consequence of the high percentage of fast rotators in @xmath3 per , which imposes a fast angular momentum transfer from the core to the envelope just after the zams .",
    "this diminishes dramatically the core angular momentum reservoir available for later stages , producing a faster spin - down for fast rotators . on the other hand ,",
    "the power - law prescription for @xmath0 leads to a remarkably greater internal differential rotation for the fast rotators and a somewhat lower internal differential rotation for the slow rotators than the two - value prescription .    the solar constraint ( equation [ eq : sun_con ] )",
    "is reasonably matched by the power - law prescription .",
    "the large differential rotation developed by fast rotators is due to the relatively large value of @xmath0 , as previously noted .",
    "in contrast , the poor matching found for the slow rotators in the two - value case may seem to be in contradiction with previous results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that in the present work an attempt is made to fit the rotation period distributions , not just their percentiles .",
    "a value of @xmath93 myr , which is the result of our best - fitting procedure ( and as such is the outcome of taking into account all the period distributions plus the solar constraint ) , turns out to be too large to recover the almost rigid rotation at the age of the sun ( cf . also figure [ fig : tauc_plaw ] for the power - law case ) .",
    "the slightly lower value of @xmath41 with respect to the power - law case ( see table [ tab : results ] ) , moreover , explains the excess of rotation at @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , this disagreement is partly relieved if the @xmath3 per distribution , which is likely prone to observational biases ( see sect . [ sec : disc ] ) , is excluded from the fitting procedure .",
    "a run performed for comparison purposes without the @xmath3 per constraint in the two - value case gives ks probabilities above @xmath95 for the intermediate age clusters ( i.e. m  50 to m  11 ) and different values of the best fitting parameters , namely @xmath96 g",
    "@xmath77 s and @xmath97 myr . a similar test for the power - law case results in negligible differences both in ks probabilities and in best - fit parameters , consistently with a moderate sensitivity to the @xmath3 per constraint .    in conclusion , the power - law prescription is more suited to fit the shape of the rotational distributions , while the two - value models better reproduces the basic features of the two extreme populations ( i.e. the slow and fast rotators ) .",
    "the two prescriptions also show different sensitivity to peculiar characteristics ( either real or due to biases ) of the distributions .",
    "clearly , none of the two models is able to completely describe rotational evolution .",
    "we modelled the evolution of rotation period distributions from the pms to the solar age , using the available observations to determine the best - fitting parameters of a modified version of the dzm .",
    "we aimed at including in the analysis the whole statistical information contained in the observed distributions as available so far ; at the same time , we tested the possibility of including in the dzm some kind of dependence of the coupling timescale on the rotational state of the star .",
    "a numerical procedure was implemented to evolve forwards in time the solar analogues subsample of the onc period distribution , used as our initial condition .",
    "the agreement of the synthetic distributions with the observed ones was evaluated by means of the ks test .",
    "this procedure was used to select the values of model parameters ensuring the best fitting of the observational constraints .    a prescription for the dependence of @xmath0 on the rotation of the star is required to fit the evolution of the whole period distributions .",
    "it is already known , in fact , that the slow and fast percentiles of the period distributions require significantly different values of @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in formulating these prescriptions ( see equations [ eq:2val ] and [ eq : powl ] )",
    "we relied on basic physical intuition , keeping the number of free parameters to a minimum .",
    "equation is the simplest way to mimic the dichotomy in @xmath0 between slow and fast rotators as suggested by earlier works .",
    "it implies that different @xmath0 values are set at early stages by some mechanism that quickly distinguishes between two separate rotation regimes , but is poorly sensitive to internal differential rotation .",
    "a different magnetic field configuration within the stellar interior might account for such a behaviour ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "equation , on the other hand , assumes that the available content of rotational kinetic energy , as measured in the dzm by the amount of differential rotation , can trigger angular momentum transport processes with an efficiency parameterised by the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "other formulations , with a power law dependence of @xmath0 on the surface angular velocity @xmath56 , with or without saturation mechanisms like that in equation , proved to be completely unsuccessful .",
    "a major limitation of this work comes from the uncertainty in the ages of the clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the very young clusters and for the stellar associations , which are also more likely to be prone to remarkable internal age scattering .    during the pms",
    ", the fitting is dependent essentially on @xmath46 and on the radius contraction as predicted by the evolutionary model .",
    "considering the uncertainties in age and the crude approximation on the role of the circumstellar disc , the fitting can be considered quite satisfactory in this part of the evolution .",
    "after the zams , when the rotational evolution becomes very sensitive to angular momentum transfer from the core to the envelope and to wind - braking , the observed cdfs do not show a regular evolution as expected from the dzm assumptions .",
    "the @xmath3 per cdf , in particular , shows a marked ( ultra ) fast - rotators excess , which is difficult to reconcile with the cdf of younger systems , either assuming a two - value or a power - law prescription for @xmath0 in the dzm .",
    "this distribution feature is not seen in any other cluster or association , except perhaps m  34 and m  11 .",
    "the consequences on the model fitting have been discussed in sect.[sec : results ] .",
    "obviously , the reasons for such a discrepancy could be : a ) the dzm is inadequate or contains oversimplified assumptions ; b ) the stellar rotation period distributions in open clusters and young associations may be affected by characteristics of the ( parent ) cluster as a whole , particularly those leading to the evaporation of circumstellar discs by uv radiation and wind from neighbour high - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; c ) the observed period distributions are incomplete and/or biased .",
    "indeed , our model does not include differences in the rotational history of clusters stars that may arise from the presence of high mass stars , multiple or prolonged star formation events , the compactness and richness of the clusters , and the stars dispersal into the field .",
    "therefore , despite the dzm may contain the essential physics to describe the stellar angular momentum evolution , a satisfactory modelling may require taking into account the peculiarities of the cluster to which the stars belong .",
    "in the case of @xmath3 per , for instance , high mass stars might have influenced the rotational history of a fraction of low mass stars by evaporating their circumstellar discs at an early stage . without an efficient disc - locking",
    ", these stars may have reached the zams ( first 30  myr ) with a very high rotation and have had no time to spin - down significantly in the subsequent @xmath98   myr .",
    "other possible sources of uncertainties in the period distribution include clusters contamination by field stars , the presence of close binaries whose high rotation rate is maintained by the tidal synchronisation between the components , and observational biases .",
    "concerning these latter , photometric monitoring with a limited temporal extension ( generally of @xmath6@xmath99 d as in the cases of m  11 , m  34 , m  35 , m  50 , ngc  2362 and of numerous members of @xmath3 per ) prevents us from detecting the slow rotation periods , making the derived distributions incomplete .",
    "moreover , for ms stars with @xmath82 d the amplitude of the optical light curve is very small ( @xmath100 mag ) , so their rotational modulation can not be measured by ground - based photometry ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of rotators with periods longer than @xmath85 d in the observed distributions shown in figures [ fig : pks_2val ] and [ fig : pks_plaw ] can therefore be due to such limitations , although this is unlikely to hamper the analysis to a significant extent as the percentage of rotators with @xmath82 is predicted to be rather low at young ages . on the other hand , a poor sampling from ground - based observations ( for example",
    ", @xmath74@xmath101 d in the case of young associations considered in our analysis ) makes it hard to detect the ultra - fast rotators , making the derived period distributions incomplete also on the fast side . despite high - precision ccd photometry and multi - site monitoring campaigns",
    "may overcome most of these difficulties , the data available to date are still rather inhomogeneous and far from being complete .",
    "most stars , especially in ms , do not show a permanent periodic modulation , and therefore deriving a rotation period is sometimes a matter of chance , unless stars are observed for several seasons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". often a beat period is detected and prolonged monitoring is required to remove aliasing effects .",
    "the effect of large spotted areas localised on opposite stellar hemispheres , producing a rotational modulation with half the true period , should also be taken into account ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dispersal of clusters stars into the field may add other selection effects . in order to assemble a complete sample",
    "one should , in principle , collect data for all stars in each cluster as well as data for all cluster s stars that have been dispersed into the field , a task which is far from being accomplished .",
    "regarding @xmath3 per , which is particularly important to constrain the rotational evolution just after the zams , an alternative explanation for the presence of a high percentage of fast and ultra - fast rotators is therefore that the dataset available may miss information about a significant fraction of slower rotators , either because of observational biases or because of an intrinsic incompleteness of the sample due to stars dispersal into the field .",
    "we note in passing that the fraction of ultra - fast rotators ( i.e. , @xmath102 d ) in the cdf of ab  dor / pleiades was reduced from @xmath103 to the current @xmath104 by the data recently acquired by @xcite .",
    "the same reasoning may also apply to @xmath3 per , m50 , m35 , m  34 and m  11 .",
    "some indication of possible observational biases in the alpha per periods can be derived from a comparison with @xmath105 measurements . using the @xcite inversion procedures for a random orientation of rotational axes and @xmath105 data from @xcite",
    ", we have derived the cumulative distribution of equatorial velocities for alpha per stars in our mass range .",
    "such procedures have been applied , for instance , by @xcite in an analysis of rotational velocities in the pleiades .",
    "we have then compared such a distribution with the cumulative distribution of equatorial velocities derived from the period measurements assuming that the radius of all stars in our mass range is approximately @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aperbias ] ) .     data ( thin line ) and from the rotation period data ( thick line ) in @xmath3 per.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for the slowest rotators , @xcite are able to derive only an upper limit of @xmath105 , which for the stars in our mass range is @xmath85 km / s .",
    "this implies that the cumulative distribution of recovered equatorial velocities is rather uncertain at the lower end of the velocity range .",
    "numerical experiments with several assumptions on the @xmath105 distribution below @xmath6 km / s have shown , however , that above @xmath107 km / s the derived cumulative distribution function is unaffected by any assumption made on the @xmath105 distribution below @xmath6 km / s .",
    "on the other hand , the expected differences in stellar radii in our mass range have negligible effects on the cumulative distribution of equatorial velocities derived from the period measurements .",
    "therefore , a meaningful comparison can be done between the fractions of stars with rotational velocities lower than , say , @xmath108 km / s in both distributions , which are approximately @xmath109 according to the @xmath105 measurements and @xmath110 according to the rotational period measurements .",
    "furthermore , from the @xcite relationships ( the overline denotes average ) @xmath111 and @xmath112\\ ] ] we derive @xmath113 km / s , and @xmath114 ( km / s)@xmath115 , while the rotational velocities inferred from the period measurements have @xmath116 km / s and @xmath117 ( km / s)@xmath115 . finally , the ks test applied to these cumulative distribution functions gives a probability of only @xmath118 that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we conclude that there is a convincing evidence of a bias in the measured period distribution in @xmath3 per towards an excess of fast rotators .",
    "having carried out such a test on the problematic period distribution of @xmath3 per , a similar comparison for other clusters in our sample would be desirable but it is outside the scope of this paper and is deferred to future work .",
    "the dzm with a power - law prescription for @xmath0 is found quite effective in describing the rotational evolution from ab  dor / pleiades to m  37 . between these two ,",
    "however , it predicts more rotators with @xmath119 d than observed in m  50 and m  35 . for m  34",
    "( which seems to have also a higher fraction of fast rotators than predicted ) and m  11 the number of available periods seems too low to draw any definitive conclusion . assuming that the dzm contains the essential physics to describe the evolution from ab  dor / pleiades to m  37 and that the age estimate is not too poor , one may reach the conclusion that a significant fraction of rotators with @xmath119  d are missing in m  50 and m  35 .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by a crude comparison between the slower rotator tail in the observed cdfs , from which m  50 and m  35 would appear rotationally older than m  37 . at ages between the zams and ab  dor /pleiades ,",
    "the dzm with a power - law prescription for @xmath0 is unable to describe the high percentage of fast and ultra - fast rotators in @xmath3 per , as discussed above , and is not able to fit the tuc - hor / col / car , despite the shape of the observed and fitted cdfs are not too different . for these latter associations , however , it should be noted that , besides the issue of completeness discussed above , the modelling is particular sensitive to age uncertainties in this evolution phase and to the @xmath3 per constraint at 70  myr .",
    "the fit using the two - value prescription for @xmath0 is more affected by the high percentage of ( ultra ) fast rotators in @xmath3 per than the power - law prescription .",
    "this prevents from obtaining a satisfactory fit for older systems , where such a high percentage of fast and ultra - fast rotators is not present .    only for m  34 , which also seems to show a high percentage of fast rotators",
    ", @xmath120 is close to unity .",
    "also for tuc - hor / col / car the two - value prescription for @xmath0 produces a synthetic cdf which is slightly higher than the power - law prescription for the faster rotators partly because of the constraint imposed by @xmath3 per .",
    "we studied the rotational evolution of solar - mass stars from pms to the solar age , using the most complete sample of observations on rotation period distributions available to date , filling the gap between @xmath13 and @xmath16 myr with recently acquired data and implementing a novel prescription on the internal rotational coupling in the framework of the dzm .",
    "although the completeness and accuracy of observational data have considerably improved in recent years , possible selection effects ( e.g. scarce sensitivity to rotational modulation with @xmath82 d , limits for detection of fast or slow rotation periods due to insufficient time sampling or extension of the observations ) , as well as the uncertainties in clusters ages , are still severe limitations for the use of the period distributions to study stellar rotational evolution . nevertheless , we investigated the dependence of the core - envelope coupling timescale @xmath0 on stellar rotation .",
    "after the zams , a power - law dependence of @xmath0 on the stellar rotational velocity produces cdfs whose shapes are more similar to observations than the two - value prescription and gives an excellent fit for ab dor / pleiades and m37 . while m34 and m11 have too few period measurements to draw firm conclusions , the discrepancies in @xmath3 per , m50 , and m35 could be due either to observational biases or to environmental effects , such as those causing early destruction of circumstellar discs .    comparing the results obtained with the two - value prescription for @xmath0 with those obtained with the power - law",
    ", it appears that the former better reproduce the extrema while the latter the shape of the observed period distributions .",
    "this conclusion may be a useful guide to formulate more sophisticated models of rotational evolution in the future .",
    "part of the discrepancy between the models and the observations here may also arise from the assumption of a single disk lifetime ( @xmath121 myr ) .",
    "assuming instead a distribution of disk lifetimes would yield more fast rotators at a given age and a broader rotation period distribution at the zams , but including this feature in the model is beyond the scope of this paper .    to put our conclusions on a firm ground , however , more observations of clusters and associations in the age range @xmath122  myr are required , together with an improvement of the model , e.g. , by including correlations with the global properties of each cluster .",
