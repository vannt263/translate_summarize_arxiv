    "theories of modified gravity ( such as @xmath0 theory , lovelock gravity , gauss - bonnet theory etc ) are constructed by adding curvature correction terms in the usual einstein - hilbert action through which the cosmic accelerated expansion might be explained @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews on modified gravity ) .",
    "such correction terms give rise to solutions of the field equations without invoking the concept of dark energy . to find the dynamical equations one can vary the action according to the metric .",
    "there is no restriction on the gravitational lagrangian to be a linear function of ricci scalar @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently some authors have taken into serious consideration the lagrangians that arestochastic \" functions with the requirement that it should be local gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was adopted in order to treat the quantization on curved spacetime .",
    "the result was that corrective term in the einstein hilbert lagrangian arises due to either background geometry and interactions among quantum fields or gravitational self interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also realized that such corrective terms should be incorporated if one wants to obtain the effective action of quantum gravity on planck scale @xcite .",
    "besides fundamental physical motivation , these theories have acquired a huge interest in cosmology as they exhibit inflationary behaviors and that the corresponding cosmological model seem very realistic @xcite . in this article",
    ", our focus will be on the scalar - tensor - vector theory ( will be referred as mog ) and the schwarschild - mog black hole ( mog ) @xcite .",
    "black holes can accelerate particles to arbitrarily high energy if the angular momentum of the particle is fine - tuned to some critical value ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this phenomenon is robust as it is founded on the basic properties of geodesics around a black hole @xcite . studying the dynamics of a particle ( either massive or massless ) around the gravitational source such as a black hole ( bh )",
    "is important because it is responsible for understanding the geometrical structure of spacetime near the bh .",
    "geodesics may display a rich structure and convey a very reliable information to understand the geometry of the bh .",
    "there are many types of geodesic motion but the circular geodesics are specially important .",
    "the exponential fade - out of a collapsing star s luminosity can be explained by the circular geodesics as given in @xcite .",
    "the motion of test particles helps to study the gravitational fields of objects experimentally and to compare the observations with the predictions about observable effects ( light deflection , gravitational time delay and perihelion shift ) .    in the surrounding of the bh ,",
    "a magnetic field is generally present @xcite , due to the presence of plasma in the vicinity of the bh . the accretion disk or a charged gas cloud is primarily responsible for the magnetic field field @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is stronger in the vicinity of bh s event horizon however it does not effect the geometry of the bh , but the motion of the charged particle moving around a bh is effected @xcite .",
    "the magnetic coupling process is likely responsible for the stability of black hole with its accretion disc @xcite . according to this process",
    ", angular momentum and energy are transferred from the black hole to its surrounding disc .",
    "the magnetic field plays an important role in transferring sufficient energy to the surrounding particles for escaping to spacial infinity @xcite .",
    "other interesting processes around bhs include evaporation and phantom energy accretion onto bhs @xcite . in this article , we revisit the model of zahrani et al @xcite for a mog black hole and explore the effects of modified gravity .",
    "it involves the collision of a bounded particle with an unbounded particle in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "the main interest lies in finding the conditions of escape of a bounded particle after the collision .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we develop the basic equations and then derive an expression for escape velocity of a neutral particle . in section iii",
    "we discuss the strength of magnetic field , and the equations of motion of the charged particle moving around weakly magnetized mog and escape velocity for particle also calculated .",
    "force acting on the particle is studied in section iv and geodesics of the particles moving around the mog are discuss in section v. lyapunov exponent is explained in section vi . in section vii and viii ,",
    "trajectories for effective potential and escape velocity of the particle are presented respectively .",
    "conclusion is given in last section .",
    "we will study the motion of particle in the equatorial plane to simplify the calculations . throughout this work we use the following metric signature @xmath2 and assume @xmath3 .",
    "motion of particles around a central massive object under the affect of a central force is a well - studied problem of classical mechanics ( or rather newtonian mechanics ) .",
    "in particular we can think of the following problem in the present context : consider a particle of mass @xmath4 moving in a circular orbit around another object of mass @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "now for the particle to escape from the gravitational field of @xmath5 , particle s initial velocity must be more than the escape velocity .",
    "the particle can gain the escape velocity either from an external force acting on it or by hitting ( or colliding ) a test particle with the particle in circular orbit .",
    "since the collision leads to transfer of energy as well , the particle will escape from the circular orbit if its energy after collision is more than a critical energy or escape energy .",
    "if however , the energy of the particle after collision is small than the critical energy , the particle falls towards @xmath5 .",
    "the relativistic version of the above scenario was investigated by zahrani et al @xcite .",
    "they studied the motion of a charged particle in the vicinity of a weakly magnetized schwarzschild black hole and focused on the bounded trajectory lying in the black hole equatorial plane . for the charged particle to escape from the innermost circular orbit , another particle ( which is neutral and coming from sufficiently far distance ) hits the charged particle .",
    "the authors obtained the corresponding conditions of escape velocity and escape energy in the resulting process .",
    "they also predicted that the motion of charged particle after collision will be chaotic due to the presence of magnetic field and strong gravitational field . although the chances of collision between two particles around black hole , in general are feeble .",
    "however the process itself is important to describe the ejection of particles from the vicinity of black holes .",
    "later on hussain et al @xcite investigated a similar scenario for a slowly rotating kerr black hole and discussed the conditions of escape for the particle .",
    "jamil et al @xcite investigated a similar scenario for a schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence .",
    "recently , moffat @xcite obtained both static and non - static black hole solutions in the scalar - tensor - vector modified gravity , the theory which he himself proposed @xcite .",
    "the theory fairly describes several astronomical and cosmological observations such as galaxy rotation curves @xcite and gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the modified gravitational field equations are given by @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a vector field with the source charge @xmath11 ( see details below ) .",

    "for the angular variable we have , @xmath177 if the left hand side of equation ( [ a ] ) is negative then the lorentz force on the particle is attractive @xcite .",
    "the motion of the charged particle is in clockwise direction .",
    "lorentz force is repulsive if left hand side of ( [ a ] ) is positive .",
    "we are not going to the detail here because it is already discussed in @xcite .",
    "our concern is only about the action of magnetic field on the charged particle .",
    "therefore , magnetic field may deform the oscillatory motion , so , the greater the strength of magnetic field , the larger will be the deformation of the orbit .",
    "hence we can conclude that larger the strength of magnetic field , easy for a particle to escape from the isco .",
    "we have also plotted in figure [ fmog8 ] escape velocity as a function of radial coordinate for different values of magnetic field parameter @xmath178 .",
    "it can be seen that the escape velocity of the particle increases as the magnetic field strength increases but it becomes almost constant just like magnetic field , away from the bh . as the magnetic field is strong near the bh",

    "we further discussed the energy condition for the particle , when it will escape or its motion remains bound .",
    "expressions for the escape velocity of the particle moving around mog - bh and for magnetic field , present in the vicinity of bh due to plasma , is derived in this work .",
    "more importantly a comparison is done for effective potentials , obtained in the presence and absence of magnetic field .",
    "it is found that presence of magnetic field enhance the stability of the orbits of the moving particles , due to the presence of it width of stable region in contrast to which we obtained in the case when magnetic field is absent .",

    "further we studied the stability by lyapunov exponent against magnetic field and a parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we conclude that stability of orbits would increase due to the presence of vector field considered in mog .",
    "we deduce that the particle have to face more repulsion to reach the singularity due to the presence of vector field as considered in mog .",
    "but the presence of magnetic field might increase the attractive force .",
    "it is found that a particle with large value of angular momentum @xmath28 would have greater possibility to reside in the stable orbits in comparison with a particle with lesser value of it .",
