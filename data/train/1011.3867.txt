    "to increase system capacity for next generation cellular systems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , interference mitigation methods such as network multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) and coordinated multipoint transmission and reception ( comp ) have been actively discussed for the multi - cell and multi - user downlink transmission . specifically , considering the case that each base station ( bs ) sends two independent messages to two different users in the cell it covers , respectively , we note that each user suffers from the inter - user interference ( iui ) and the inter - cell interference ( ici ) . to mitigate those interferences effectively in the case ,",
    "a simple coordinated zero - forcing ( zf ) scheme was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this scheme reduces both ici and iui simultaneously in the multiple - input single - output interfering broadcast channels ( miso - ifbc ) . since this scheme considered a user with a single antenna , it only designed the transmit beamforming vectors to remove both iui and ici .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the coordinated zf scheme achieves the optimal degrees of freedom ( dof ) on that channel through the converse argument . in @xcite , the coordinated zf scheme for the mimo - ifbc",
    "was extended by taking multiple receive antennas into account .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that when there are a bs with @xmath5 transmit antennas and @xmath0 users with @xmath6 receive antennas in each cell , the coordinated zf scheme achieves the dof of @xmath7 in the two - cell mimo - ifbc . in @xcite and @xcite , a precoding scheme called the subspace interference alignment ( ia ) for the mimo - ifbc",
    "was introduced by appropriately exploiting the concept of the original ia in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the subspace ia is composed of two cascaded precoders .",
    "the first precoder is to put ici vectors on a multi - dimensional subspace .",
    "the second procoder is constructed so that the iui vectors lie on the subspace spanned by the ici vectors .",
    "consequently , the signal space occupied by the iui vectors is aligned with the signal space spanned by the ici vectors , which increases the subspace dimension for desired signal vectors especially in the symmetric antenna case .",
    "in addition , it is noted that this technique requires the same amount of feedback as a conventional single cell multi - user mimo system .",

    "in general , collaboration levels of user cooperative links could be classified into two categories : received - signal forwarding and channel state information ( csi ) sharing scenarios .",
    "most prior works on user cooperation have considered the received - signal forwarding cases , which act as a cooperative relay in different channel models such as broadcast channel @xcite-@xcite , two - user interference channel @xcite-@xcite , and one - sided interference channel @xcite etc .    in this paper , we propose a novel cross - network interference alignment algorithm exploiting another channel resource available for user cooperation , i.e. , a cooperation channel among cell - edge users for the two - cell mimo - ifbc .",
