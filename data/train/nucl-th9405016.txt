    "<S> magnetic quadrupole moment is a static characteristic of a quantum system which is forbidden by p- and t - invariance . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment ( nmqm ) can be induced both by the nucleon electric dipole moment@xcite and by p- and t - odd nuclear forces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest to nmqm is due to the experimental searches for p- and t - odd effects in atoms and molecules ( see , e.g. , book@xcite ) .    the manifestation of electric dipole moment ( edm ) , which also violates p- and t - invariance , in atomic and molecular phenomena is strongly hampered by the electrostatic screening . in a stationary system of nonrelativistic pointlike particles interacting via coulomb forces such a screening of average electric field acting on any </S>",
    "<S> paricle is complete . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in such a system for a particle edm there is nothing to interact with , which means that this edm just can not be observed@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear dipole moment becomes observable however due to the finite size of a nucleus , more exactly due to different distribution of its charge and edm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one more way to transfer nuclear p- and t - violation to an atom or molecule is via nmqm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it demands of course nuclei with spin @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the nmqm induces p- and t - odd effects only in atoms ( molecules ) with unpaired electron angular momenta since it interacts directly with magnetic field of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> however , when operative , the nmqm is much more effective for circumventing the electrostatic shielding in atoms and molecules@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the nmqm induced by the p- and t - odd internucleon interaction can be much larger than that due to the nucleon edm . in that paper </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole moments , induced by that interaction , were evaluated in a simple model where the profile of nuclear density was assumed to coincide with that of nuclear potential . in the present article </S>",
    "<S> we calculate nmqm within a more accurate approach . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we use a realistic description of the nuclear density ; the nucleon wave functions and green s functions are obtained with woods - saxon potential which includes the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we include also the contribution of the current generated by the spin - orbit interaction ; contrary to naive expectations , this contribution does exist for an outer neutron , but does not for an outer proton . one more model admitting a closed analytical solution is considered , that of the oscillator potential . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict throughout the present paper to the single - particle approximation , that of a valence nucleon above a spherically - symmetric core .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach was recently used by us@xcite for treatment of nuclear anapole moments , p - odd , but t - even characteristic .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 . </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with discussing the t - and p - odd nucleon - nucleon potential . </S>",
    "<S> in the local limit and to first order in the nucleon velocities @xmath1 it can be written as follows ( see , e.g. , book@xcite ) @xmath2 \\cdot \\ { ( \\vec{p}_a - \\vec{p}_b ) , \\delta ( \\vec{r}_a - \\vec{r}_b ) \\ } \\left)\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath3 means anticommutator . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless constants @xmath4 characterize the magnitude of the interaction in units of the fermi weak interaction constant @xmath5 and are supplied with subscripts in order to distinguish between protons and neutrons .    after averaging this expression over the core nucleons we obtain the p- and t - odd mean field potential for an outer nucleon @xmath6 here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the density of the core nucleons normalized by the condition @xmath8 @xmath9 ; @xmath10 the subscript @xmath11 takes the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 for an outer proton and neutron , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that , as distinct from the case of the p - odd , t - even interaction , no contact current is generated here in the single - particle approximation , even if one starts from the two - body interaction ( [ tb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is only the last term in ( [ tb ] ) , dependent on @xmath14 , which contributes to the contact current operator @xmath15 , \\delta ( \\vec{r } - \\vec{r}_a ) \\}.\\ ] ] however , even this contribution vanishes obviously after averaging over the core nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> now , the correction @xmath16 to the valence nucleon wave function generated by the interaction ( [ tvpot ] ) is a solution of the equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the unperturbed mean field hamiltonian and the unperturbed nucleon wave function . to begin with , </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss a simple model where the profiles of the nuclear density and the central mean field potential coincide , and the spin - orbit potential is absent@xcite @xmath20 eq.([schrod ] ) transforms here as follows : @xmath21\\psi(\\vec{r}),\\ ] ] which gives @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a spherical spinor , @xmath24 is the unperturbed radial wave function of a nucleon , and @xmath25 .    even in a more general case , beyond this model </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to define the correction @xmath26 to radial wave function by the following relation : @xmath27 the correction @xmath26 can be calculated using two independent solutions of the radial schrdinger equation @xmath28 and @xmath29 , regular at the origin and at the infinity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are normalized to the unit wronskian : @xmath30 this correction is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a density profile @xmath35 .    the magnetic quadrupole moment operator @xmath36 is defined by analogy with the electric quadrupole one @xmath37 , via the interaction with the corresponding field gradient : @xmath38 the symmetric tensor @xmath36 is related in the following way to the current density @xmath39 : @xmath40 for a valence nucleon this operator can be presented as@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the nucleon magnetic moment , and @xmath43 is equal 1 for a proton and 0 for neutron .    </S>",
    "<S> with the usual definition @xmath44 one obtains after taking expectation value over angular variables @xmath45 the radial matrix element here is @xmath46    for the simple model described above ( [ corm ] ) the matrix element can be calculated analytically with the following result @xmath47    one more model allowing for an exact analytical result for mqm is that of the oscillator potential . </S>",
    "<S> here it is convenient to start from expression ( [ rme ] ) for the matrix element . separating the tensor structure in ( reftvpot ) , ( [ mqms ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath48.\\ ] ] substituting this identity into ( [ hme ] ) and using the completeness relation , we find @xmath49|0\\rangle.\\ ] ] taking again expectation value over angular variables , we obtain @xmath50    \\3 . </S>",
    "<S> expression ( [ mqms ] ) for the mqm corresponds to the contribution of the convection and the spin electromagnetic current densities . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we discuss one more contribution to mqm , that originating from the momentum dependence of the spin - orbit two - nucleon forces . in the single - particle approximation </S>",
    "<S> this current density is@xcite @xmath51 for a valence proton and @xmath52 for a valence neutron . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 is the constant entering two - body proton - neutron spin - orbit treated in the contact limit : @xmath54 the proton - proton spin - orbit interaction does not contribute to the current density in the zero - range limit we use .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct calculation shows that , contrary to naive expectations , the proton spin - orbit current ( [ jpls ] ) does not contribute to the static nmqm . </S>",
    "<S> however , for an outer neutron the corresponding correction does not vanish . </S>",
    "<S> it equals @xmath55    \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> we are ready now for a more realistic single - particle calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical treatment is based on the woods - saxon potential including spin - orbit interaction and on a realistic description of nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles of both density and the central part of nuclear potential are described by a fermi - type function @xmath56 the total single - particle potential @xmath57 is chosen in a standard woods - saxon form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the values of the density parameters from book@xcite : @xmath60 the woods - saxon potential is parametrized as in@xcite : @xmath61 the spin - orbit interaction constant as fitted in ref.@xcite is : @xmath62    the correction @xmath26 calculated in this way is plotted in fig.1 together with the model function ( [ corm ] ) . obviously , the latter is a reasonably good approximation to the correction @xmath63 , as calculated numerically in the more realistic approach .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are conveniently presented in terms of the dimensionless constant @xmath64 related to the nmqm as follows @xmath65 this constant itself consists in general of two contributions : @xmath66    the values of @xmath64 calculated for two neighbouring nuclei , with odd z and odd n respectively , are presented in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\5 . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> let us compare the results obtained for the nmqm , generated by p- and t - odd potential , with those for the nuclear anapole moment ( am ) , generated by p - violating , but t - even potential . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we wish to compare the stability of nuclear single - particle calculations for those two moments , t - odd and t - even .    for the sake of comparison with the constant @xmath64 calculated here , it is convenient to delete from the dimensionless am characteristic @xmath67 the fine structure constant @xmath68 ( related to the electromagnetic interaction of an atomic electron with nuclear am ) and the p - odd nucleon - nucleon constant @xmath69 ( the t - even analogue of the constant @xmath4 used here ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical value of this am characteristic is@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    as to @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> its typical value is @xmath72    the ratio of those two factors , i.e. , of the t - odd effect to t - even one , @xmath73 is very small . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the am enhancement @xmath74 can be traced back to the am dependence on the geometrical cross - section of nucleus , this is a bulk nucleus effect@xcite . as to the nmqm , its magnitude depends completely on the nuclear boundary ( see eqs.([tvpot ] ) , ( [ oscme ] ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it results not only in the relative suppression of the t - odd effect . </S>",
    "<S> the value of nmqm is more sensitive to the details of the nuclear model than that of am , it is less stable .    </S>",
    "<S> however reliable theoretical predictions both for am and nmqm can be obtained only when the single - particle calculations will be supplemented by a serious treatment of many - body effects .    </S>",
