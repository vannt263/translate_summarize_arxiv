    "courant algebroids were introduced by liu , weinstein , and xu in @xcite in order to describe the double of a lie bialgebroid .",
    "they were further investigated by roytenberg beginning during his ph.d .",
    "studies and a formulation in terms of a dorfman bracket was discovered @xcite as well as the fitting into a two - term @xmath1-algebra @xcite . in @xcite hansen and strobl discovered four - form twisted courant algebroids arising naturally in the courant sigma model with a wess  zumino boundary term .",
    "these @xmath0-twisted courant algebroids were further investigated by liu and sheng in @xcite where the observation was made that exact @xmath0-twisted courant algebroids , they fit into a short exact sequence with the tangent and cotangent bundle , always have an exact four - form @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we want to generalize the notion of @xmath0-twist and exhibit examples that do not come from an exact or even closed four - form .",
    "the idea is analogous to @xmath0-twisted lie algebroids ( introduced in @xcite ) that guided from an exterior covariant derivative ( proposition  [ p : d ] ) that occurs naturally for strongly anchored almost courant algebroids with anchor @xmath2 on the exterior algebra of sections of @xmath3 , one permits the jacobiator to be a @xmath3-four - form closed under the exterior covariant derivative",
    ". we will give examples of generalized exact four - forms , _",
    "i.e. _  starting from a courant algebroid with anchor @xmath2 and a @xmath3-three - form with a certain integrability condition we define a dorfman bracket together with a ( nontrivial ) @xmath3-four - form @xmath0 that fit under the above idea .",
    "since already the definition of the closed generalized four - form requires sections of a possibly singular vector bundle , we also give a definition generalizing roytenberg s idea of courant  dorfman algebras in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we carry over the idea of stinon and xu @xcite to define cochains as a subset of the exterior algebra of the @xmath0-twisted courant algebroid such that the naive expression of a differential by the formula that holds for lie algebroids actually gives a cochain again and squares to 0 in theorem  [ thm : naive ] .",
    "we end the treatment with the obvious generalization of dirac structures to @xmath0-twisted courant algebroids and strobl s as well as sheng ",
    "liu s idea @xcite that such dirac structures give @xmath0-twisted lie algebroids .    in the mean - time parallel developments",
