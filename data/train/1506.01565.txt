    "how do real - world networks evolve with time ?",
    "while empirical studies provide many intuitions and expectations , many questions remain open . in particular , we lack tools to characterize and quantitatively compare temporal graph dynamics . in turn ,",
    "such tools require good observables to quantify the ( temporal ) relationships between networks .",
    "in particular , the few network dynamics models that currently exist are often _ oblivious of the network type_. this is problematic , as complex networks come in many different flavors , including social networks , biological networks , or physical networks .",
    "it seems highly unlikely that these very different graphs evolve in a similar manner .",
    "a natural prerequisite to measure evolutionary distances are good metrics to _ compare _ graphs .",
    "the classic similarity measure for graphs is the _ graph edit distance ( @xmath0 ) _",
    "@xcite : the graph edit distance  @xmath1 between two graphs  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 is defined as the minimal number of _ graph edit operations _ that are needed to transform  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 .",
    "the specific set of allowed graph edit operations depends on the context , but typically includes node and link insertions and deletions .",
    "while graph edit distance metrics play an important role in computer graphics and are widely applied to pattern analysis and recognition , @xmath4 is not well - suited for measuring similarities of networks in other contexts  @xcite : the set of graphs at a certain graph edit distance  @xmath5 from a given graph  @xmath6 exhibit very diverse characteristics and seem unrelated ; being oblivious to semantics , the @xmath4 does not capture any intrinsic structure typically found in real - world networks .    a similarity measure that takes into account the inherent structure of a graph",
    "may however have many important applications .",
    "a large body of work on graph similarities focusing on a variety of use cases have been developed in the past ( see our discussion in section  [ sec : relwork ] ) .",
    "depending on the context in which they are to be used , one or another is more suitable . in particular",
    ", we argue that graph similarities and graph distance measures are also an excellent tool for the analysis , comparison and prediction of temporal network traces , allowing us to answer questions such as : _ do these two networks have a common ancestor ? _ _ are two evolution patterns similar ? _ or _ what is a likely successor network for a given network ?",
    "_ however , we argue that in terms of graph similarity measures , there is no panacea : rather , graphs and their temporal patterns , come with many faces . accordingly , we in this paper , propose to use a parametric , _ centrality - based approach _ to measure graph similarities and distances , which in turn can be used to study the evoluation of networks .",
    "more than one century ago , camille jordan introduced the first graph _ centrality _ measure in his attempt to capture `` the center of a graph '' . since then the family of centrality measures has grown larger and is commonly employed in many graph - related studies .",
    "all major graph - processing libraries commonly export functionality for degree , closeness , betweenness , clustering , pagerank and eigenvector centralities . in the context of static graphs ,",
    "_ centralities _ have proven to be a powerful tool to extract meaningful information on the structure of the networks , and more precisely on the _ role _ every participant ( node ) has in the network . in social network analysis ,",
    "centralities are widely used to measure the importance of nodes , e.g. , to determine key players in social networks , or main actors in the propagation of diseases , etc .    today",
    ", there is no consensus on  good \" and  bad \" centralities : each centrality captures a particular angle of a node s topological role , some of which can be either crucial or insignificant , depending on the application .",
    "_ am i important because i have many friends , because i have important friends , or because without me , my friends could not communicate together ? _",
    "the answer to this question is clearly context - dependent .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that the perceived quality of network similarities or distances measuring the difference between two networks depends on the focus and application just as much . instead of debating the advantages and disadvantages of a set of similarities and distances , we provide a framework to apply them to characterize network evolution from different perspectives .",
    "in particular , we leverage centralities to provide a powerful tool to quantify network changes .",
    "the intuition is simple : to measure how a network evolves , we measure the change of the nodes roles and importance in the network , by leaving the responsibility to quantify node importance to centralities .",
    "[ [ our - contributions ] ] our contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this paper is motivated by the observation that centralities can be useful to study the dynamics of networks over time , taking into account the individual roles of nodes ( in contrast to , e.g. , isomorphism - based measures , as they are used in the context of anonymous graphs ) , as well as the context and semantics ( in contrast to , e.g. , graph edit distances ) .",
    "in particular , we introduce the notion of _ centrality distance _",
    "@xmath7 for two graphs  @xmath8 , a graph similarity measure based on a _ node centrality _  @xmath9 .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to identify and characterize the different faces of graph dynamics . to this end , we study five generative graph models and seven dynamic real world networks in more details .",
    "our evaluation methodology comparing the quality of different similarity measures to a random baseline using data from actual graph evolutions , may be of independent interest .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how centrality distances provide interesting insights into the structural evolution of these networks and show that actual evolutionary paths are far from being random .",
    "moreover , we build upon the centrality distance concept to construct dynamic graph signatures .",
    "the intuition is simple : we measure the probability of an update to be considered as an outlier compared to a uniformly random evolution .",
    "this allows us to quantify the deviation of a given dynamic network from a purely random evolution ( our null - model ) of the same structure for a set of centrality distances .",
    "the signature consisting of the resulting deviation values enables the comparison of different dynamisms on a fair basis , independently from scale and sampling considerations .",
    "[ [ examples ] ] examples + + + + + + + +    to motivate the need for tools to analyse network evolution , we consider two simple examples .",
    "* example 1 . * [ local / global scenario ] consider three graphs  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ,  @xmath10 over five nodes  @xmath11 :  @xmath2 is a line , where  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 are connected ;  @xmath3 is a cycle , i.e. ,  @xmath2 with an additional link  @xmath14 ; and  @xmath10 is  @xmath2 with an additional link  @xmath15 . in this example , we first observe that  @xmath3 and  @xmath10 have the same graph edit distance to  @xmath2 :  @xmath16 , as they contain one additional edge .",
    "however , in a social network context , one would intuitively expect  @xmath10 to be closer to  @xmath2 than  @xmath3 .",
    "for example , in a friendship network a short - range `` _ _ triadic closure _ _ ''  @xcite link may be more likely to emerge than a long - range link : friends of friends may be more likely to become friends themselves in the future .",
    "moreover , more local changes are also expected in mobile environments ( e.g. , under bounded human mobility and speed ) .",
    "as we will see , the centrality distance concept of this paper can capture such differences .",
    "* example 2 . * [ evolution scenario ] as a second synthetic example , consider two graphs  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 , where  @xmath17 is a line topology and  @xmath18 is a `` shell network '' ( see also figure  [ fig : methodology ] ) .",
    "how can we characterize evolutionary paths leading from the  @xmath17 topology to  @xmath18 ?",
    "note that the graph edit distance does not provide us with any information about the likelihood or the role changes of _ evolutionary paths _ from  @xmath17 to @xmath18 , i.e. , on the order of edge insertions : there are many possible orders in which the missing links can be added to  @xmath17 , and these orders do not differ in any way when comparing them with the graph edit distance .",
    "in reality , however , we often have some expectations on how a graph may have evolved between two given snapshots  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 . for example , applying the triadic closure principle to our example , we would expect that the missing links are introduced one - by - one , from left to right .     to a shell graph  @xmath18 . ]",
    "the situation may look different in technological , man - made networks .",
    "adding links from left to right only slowly improves the `` routing efficiency '' of the network : after the addition of  @xmath19 edges from left to right , the longest shortest path is  @xmath20 hops , for  @xmath21 .",
    "a more efficient evolution of the network is obtained by connecting @xmath22 to the furthest node , adding links to the middle of the network , resulting in a faster distance reduction : after  @xmath19 edge insertions , the distance is roughly reduced by a factor  @xmath19 .",
    "thus , different network evolution patterns can be observed in real networks . instead of defining application - dependent similarities with design choices focusing on which evolution patterns are more expected from a certain network , we provide a framework that allows the joint characterization of graph dynamics along different axes .",
    "[ [ organization ] ] organization + + + + + + + + + + + +    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] provides the reader with the necessary background .",
    "section  [ sec : graph - dist ] introduces our centrality distance framework and section  [ sec : methodology ] our methodology to study the different graph dynamics empirically . section  [ sec : experiments ] reports on results from analyzing real and generated networks . after reviewing related work in section  [ sec : relwork ] ,",
    "we conclude our contribution in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this paper considers _ labeled _ graphs  @xmath23 , where vertices @xmath24 have unique identifiers and are connected via undirected edges  @xmath25 . in the following ,",
    "we denote as  @xmath26 the set of neighbors of node  @xmath27 :  @xmath28 .",
    "a temporal network trace is a sequence  @xmath29 $ ] , where  @xmath30 represents the network at the  @xmath31 snapshot .",
    "we focus on _ node centralities _ , a centrality being a real - valued function assigning `` importance values '' to nodes . obviously , the notion of importance is context - dependent , which has led to many different definitions of centralities .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a thorough and formal discussion on centralities .    a _ centrality _",
    "@xmath9 is a function  @xmath32 that , given a graph  @xmath23 and a vertex  @xmath33 , returns a non - negative value  @xmath34 .",
    "the centrality function is defined over all vertices  @xmath35 of a given graph  @xmath6 .    by convention",
    ", we define the centrality of a node without edges to be  0 .",
    "we write @xmath36 to refer to the vector in @xmath37 where the @xmath31 element is @xmath38 for a given order of the identifiers .",
    "centralities are a common way to characterize networks and their vertices . frequently studied centralities include the _ degree centrality _",
    "( @xmath39 ) , the _ betweenness centrality _ ( @xmath40 ) , the _ closeness centrality _ ( @xmath41 ) , and the _ pagerank centrality _ ( @xmath42 ) among many more . a node is  @xmath43-central if it has many edges : the degree centrality is simply the node degree ; a node is  @xmath44-central if it is on many shortest paths : the betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths going through the node ; a node is  @xmath45-central if it is close to many other nodes : the closeness centrality measures the inverse of the distances to all other nodes ; and a node is  @xmath46-central if the probability that a random walk on @xmath6 visits this node is high .",
    "we use the classical definitions for centralities , and the exact formulas are presented in  [ appendix : centrality ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "finally , throughout this paper , we will define the graph edit distance  @xmath0 between two graphs  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 as the minimum number of operations to transform  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 ( or vice versa ) , where an _ operation _ is one of the following : link insertion and link removal .",
    "the canonical distance measure is the graph edit distance ,  @xmath0 .",
    "however ,  @xmath0 often provides limited insights into the graph dynamics in practice .",
    "figure  [ fig : methodology ] shows an example with two evolutionary paths : an incremental  ( _ left _ ) and a binary  ( _ right _ ) path that go from  @xmath17 to  @xmath18 . with respect to  @xmath0 , there are many equivalent shortest paths for moving from @xmath17 to  @xmath18 .",
    "however , intuitively , not all traces are equally likely for dynamic networks , as the structural roles that nodes in networks have are often preserved and do not change arbitrarily . clearly ,",
    "studying graph evolution with ged thus can not help us to understand how structural properties of graphs evolve .",
    "the graph edit distance  @xmath0 does not provide much insights into graph evolution .",
    "we in this paper aim to enrich the graph similarity measure with semantics . at the heart of our approach lies the concept of _ centrality distance _ : a simple and flexible tool to study the similarity of graphs .",
    "essentially , the centrality distance measures the similarity between two centrality vectors .",
    "it can be used to measure the distance between two arbitrary graphs , not only between graphs with graph edit distance 1 .    given a centrality  @xmath9",
    ", we define the centrality distance  @xmath47 between any two graphs as the sum of the node - wise difference of the centrality values :  @xmath48    thus , the centrality distance intuitively measures the magnitude by which the roles of different nodes change .",
    "while we focus on the 1-norm in this paper , the concept of centrality distance can be useful also for other norms .    both the importance of node roles as well as the importance of node role changes is application - dependent . due to the large variety of processes",
    "dynamic graphs can capture , there is no one - size - fits - it - all measure of importance . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the `` intuitive '' similarity properties proposed by faloutsos et al .",
    "for instance , the proposed edge importance property should penalize changes that create disconnected components more than changes that maintain the connectivity properties of the graphs .",
    "now imagine a cycle graph of 100 nodes @xmath49 , and a single additional node @xmath27 connected to @xmath50 . according to the proposed edge importance property the most important link is @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , it is the only link whose removal would create a disconnected component ( containing @xmath27 alone ) .",
    "yet the removal of any other link would double the diameter of the structure . or in an information dissemination network",
    "all nodes would have to update half of their routing tables . so which link is more important ?",
    "the answer clearly depends on the context .",
    "similar examples can be found for other properties proposed in  @xcite , e.g. , regarding submodularity and focus - awareness .",
    "not only are these properties hard to formalize , their utility varies from application to application .",
    "we conclude by noting that given two centralities @xmath52 and @xmath53 and two arbitrary graphs @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath54 nodes , the respective distances are typically different , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "hence , using a set of different centrality distances , we can explore the variation of the graph dynamics in more than one `` dimension '' .",
    "in order to characterize the different faces of graph dynamics and to study the benefits of centrality - based measures , we propose a simple methodology . intuitively , given a centrality capturing well the roles of different nodes in a real - world setting , we expect the centrality distance between two consecutive graph snapshots @xmath56 and  @xmath57 to be smaller than the typical distance from  @xmath56 to other graphs that have the same ged .    to verify this intuition , we define a _ null model _ for evolution .",
    "a null model generates networks using patterns and randomization , i.e. , certain elements are held constant and others are allowed to vary stochastically .",
    "ideally , the randomization is designed to mimic the outcome of a random process that would be expected in the absence of a particular mechanism  @xcite . applied to our case",
    ", this means that starting from a given snapshot @xmath56 that represents the fixed part of the null model , if the evolution follows a null model , then any graph randomly generated from @xmath56 at the given @xmath0 is evenly likely to appear .    concretely ,",
    "for all consecutive graph pairs  @xmath56 and  @xmath57 of a network trace , we determine the graph edit distance ( or `` radius '' )  @xmath58 .",
    "then , we generate a set @xmath59 of  @xmath60 sample graphs  @xmath61 at the same @xmath4  @xmath62 from @xmath56 _ uniformly at random_. that is , to create @xmath63 , we first start from a copy of @xmath56 and select @xmath62 node pairs , @xmath64 , uniformly at random . for each of these pairs @xmath65",
    "we add the edge @xmath65 to @xmath63 if it does not exist in @xmath56 or we remove it if it was in @xmath56 originally . such randomly built sample graphs at the same graph edit distance allow us to assess the impact of a uniformly random evolution of the same magnitude from the same starting graph  @xmath56 : @xmath66 in other words , @xmath56 is the pattern and the evolution to @xmath63 at graph edit distance @xmath62 is the randomized part of the null model describes results obtained for a null model that guarantees the average degree of @xmath57 in the sample graphs . ] .    as a next step ,",
    "given a centrality  @xmath9 , we compare @xmath57 with the set @xmath59 that samples the evolution following the null model .",
    "we consider that @xmath57 does not follow the null model if it is an _ outlier _ in the set @xmath59 for the centrality @xmath9 .",
    "practically , @xmath57 is considered an outlier if the absolute value of its distance from @xmath56 minus the mean distance of @xmath59 to @xmath56 is at least twice the standard deviation , i.e. , if @xmath67    given a temporal trace @xmath68 , we define @xmath69 as the fraction of outliers in the trace for centrality @xmath9 .",
    "an ensemble of such values @xmath70 for a set of centralities @xmath71 is called a _",
    "dynamic signature _ of @xmath68 .",
    "based on our centrality framework and methodology , we can now shed some light on the different faces of graph dynamics , using real world data sets .    * * caida ( as ) : * this data captures the autonomous systems relationships as captured by the caida project .",

    "manufacture_. _ uci _ , _ hypertext _ , _ infectious _ and _ manufacture _ all exhibit a high level of dynamics with respect to their number of links .",

    "it holds that the induced centrality distance between  @xmath56 and  @xmath57 is often lower than between  @xmath56 and an arbitrary other graph with the same distance .",
    "there are however a few noteworthy details .    _",
    "hypertext _ and _ infectious _ exhibit very similar dynamics compared from a ged perspective as shown in figure  [ fig : datasets ] . yet from the other centralities perspective , their dynamism is very different .",
    "consider for instance _ infectious _ for @xmath42 , where the measured distance is consistently an order of magnitude less than the sampled one .",
    "this can be understood from the link creation mechanics : in _ infectious _ , visitors at different time periods never meet . by connecting these in principle very remote visitors ,",
    "the null model dynamics creates highly important links .",
    "this does not happen in _ hypertext _ where the same group of researchers meet repeatedly .",
    "in the monotonically growing co - authorship network of icdcs , we can observe that closeness and ( ego ) betweenness distances grow over time , which is not the case for the other networks in figure  [ fig : chronogram ] .",
    "when looking at other centrality distances , we observe that even though the local structure changes , a different set of properties remains mostly unaltered across different networks .",
    "moreover , for some _ ( graph , distance ) _ pairs , like  @xmath79 on _ icdcs _ ,  @xmath45 on _ hypertext _ , or  @xmath46 on _ infectious _ , the measured distance is orders of magnitude lower than the median of the sampled ones .",
    "this underlines a clear difference between random evolution and the observed one from this centrality perspective : the link update dynamics is biased .",
    "figure  [ fig : spider ] summarizes the  @xmath80 signatures for  @xmath81 applied to 7 real and 5 synthetic graphs in the form of a histogram chart  for synthetic graphs , each point is the average of 50 independent realizations of the model , and  @xmath82 .",
    "that is , each chart represents the probability of having graph evolutions being outliers with respect to the null model for the corresponding centralities .",
    "interestingly , this `` distinction ratio '' is not uniform among datasets .",
    "on _ caida _ , _ infectious _ and _ uci _ , the ratio is high for local centralities such as _ pagerank _ and _ clustering _ , and low for global centralities such as _ closeness _ or _ betweenness_. on the contrary , _ hypertext _ and _ manufacture _ exhibit large ratios for global centralities and small ratios for local centralities .",
    "both local and global centralities perform well on souk .",

    "synthetic scenarios are depicted in _",
    "blue _ , real scenarios in _ red_. the black line at @xmath83 represents the null model , i.e. , the fraction of graphs that are at distance at least @xmath76 from the mean in a normal distribution .",

    "to complement our observations on real networks with graph snapshots produced according to a model , we investigated graph traces generated by some of the most well - known models : _ erds - rnyi _",

    "perhaps the most striking observation is that all tested dynamic network models have low  @xmath69 values for all  @xmath9 .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the graph edit distance between two subsequent snapshots is one and thus the centrality vectors do not vary as much as between the snapshots and the sampled graphs of the same graph edit distance for the real networks .",
    "moreover , these randomized synthetic models are closer to the null model , and lack some of the characteristics ( like link locality ) of real world networks . furthermore , we observe that each random network model exhibits distinct dynamics signatures , with er being closest to the null model .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , our paper is the first to combine the concepts of centralities and graph distances . in the following , we review related work in the two fields in turn , and subsequently discuss additional literature on dynamic graphs .    * graph characterizations and centralities .",

    "they distinguish between comparison levels ( node , community , network level ) and identify vector - based , classifier - based , and matching - based methods .",
    "surprisingly they are able to show that the results of many methods are highly correlated .",
    "netsimile  @xcite allows to assess the similarity between @xmath84 networks , possibly with different sizes and no overlaps in nodes or links .",
    "netsimile uses different social theories to compute similarity scores that are size - invariant , enabling mining tasks such as clustering , visualization , discontinuity detection , network transfer learning , and re - identification across networks .",
    "the deltacon method  @xcite is based on the normed difference of node - to - node affinity according to a belief propagation method . more precisely , the similarity between two graphs is the root euclidean distance of their two affinity matrices or an approximation thereof .",

    "a closely related work but using a different approach is by kunegis  @xcite .",
    "kunegis studies the evolution of networks from a spectral graph theory perspective .",

    "this paper was motivated by the observation that in terms of graph similarity measures , there is no `` one size fits it all '' .",
    "in particular , we have proposed a centrality - based distance measure , and introduced a simple methodology to study the different faces of graph dynamics . indeed",
    ", our experiments confirm that the evolution patterns of dynamic networks are not universal , and different networks need different centrality distances to describe their behavior .",
    "we observe that the edges in networks represent structural characteristics that are inherently connected to the roles of the nodes in these networks .",
    "these structures are maintained under changes , which explains the inertia of centrality distance which capture these properties .",
    "this behavior can be used to distinguish between natural and random network evolution . after analyzing a temporal network trace with a set of distance centralities",
    ", one can guess with confidence for future snapshots if they belong to the trace .",
    "we believe that our work opens a rich field for future research . in this paper , we focused on five well - known centralities and their induced distances , and showed that they feature interesting properties when applied to the use case of dynamic social networks .",
    "however , we regard our approach as a _ similarity framework _ , which can be configured with various additional centralities and metrics , which may not even be restricted by distance metrics , but can be based on the angles between centrality vectors or use existing correlation metrics ( e.g. , pearson correlation , tanimoto coefficient , log likelihood ) .",
    "finally , exploiting the properties of centrality distances , especially their ability to distinguish and quantify between similar evolutionary traces , also opens the door to new applications , such as graph interpolation ( what is a likely graph sequence between two given snapshots of a trace ) and extrapolation , i.e. , for link prediction algorithms based on centralities .",
