    "the vimos vlt deep survey is dedicated to study galaxies , large scale structures and agn evolution up to @xmath3 . to determine the evolutionary status of the galaxy and agn population as a function of lookback time",
    ", it has been recognized early in the survey design phase that the large range in redshifts and the complex physical phenomena probed require to expand the core observations of the vvds from the visible domain to a broad multi - wavelength spectrum .",
    "observing the rest - frame sed of galaxies ( e.g. in the b - band rest frame ) at the same wavelength from @xmath4 to @xmath3 , and having a sufficiently accurate estimate of the k - correction necessary to compute absolute magnitudes , requires to obtain deep photometric data from the u band to the k band .",
    "furthermore , to get a complete picture of e.g. the star formation process , for galaxies with variable amount of dust extinction , or to study the evolution of large scale structures or agns , it is necessary to expand the wavelength baseline of observations from the far uv to the far ir , from the radio - waves to the x - rays .",
    "we describe here the multi - wavelength approach followed by the vvds , and present early results from the first epoch vvds observations .",
    "we describe the effort to assemble for the first time an unbiased magnitude limited sample of galaxy redshifts and spectra @xmath5 up to @xmath3 , going through the `` redshift desert '' @xmath6 , and present preliminary results on the evolution of galaxies and large scale structures up to @xmath2 .",
    "the vimos vlt deep survey has been designed from the start as an extensive survey with multi - color bvri data obtained at cfht @xcite , and deep spectroscopy obtained with vimos on the vlt @xcite , forming the core of the survey .",
    "the core observations are obtained on several fields , each @xmath7deg@xmath8 : ( i ) multi - color photometry from b to i band , leading to clean i - band magnitude selected samples and broad band spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , and ( ii ) multi - object spectra with a goal of @xmath9 objects to @xmath10 and @xmath0 .    in addition",
    ", our vvds team has been conducting observations in other wavelength ( u and k bands , radio ) , and has been connecting with other survey groups to stimulate other wavelengths observations in the vvds fields ( galex - uv , x - rays with xmm and chandra , sirtf , see these proceedings ) .",
    "we have also been advocating the need for the accurate knowledge of galaxy morphologies over large scales with the hst , and we are participating to the hst - cosmos program set to observe 2deg@xmath8 on the vvds-10h field with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) @xcite .    the current spectroscopic vvds data has been obtained in november- december 2002 in an observing campaign from which 18 nights were clear .",
    "more than 20000 spectra have been obtained , from which about 15000 secure galaxy and agn redshifts are available in 3 different fields .",
    "the vvds is the first survey to assemble a complete sample of galaxies based on a simple i - band limit down to @xmath0 .",
    "magnitude limited samples have the advantage of a controlled bias in the selection of the target galaxies , which can lead to a secure census of the galaxy population as seen at a given rest - frame wavelength ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the drawback is that , as the magnitudes get fainter , the redshift range gets larger , and identifying redshifts out of a very large range of possibilities becomes increasingly harder from a fixed set of observed wavelengths .",
    "the vvds default wavelength range for the vimos observations is @xmath11 , observed at a spectral resolution @xmath12 to allow for a large multiplex gain during the multi - slit vimos observations .",
    "it allows a secure follow - up of the spectral signature of galaxies from [ oii]3727@xmath13 to the 4000@xmath13 region and minimize the bias in the identification of galaxy redshifts up to @xmath14 .",
    "however , measuring the redshifts of galaxies with @xmath1 is quite challenging with generally faint features , and a lack of published observed galaxy templates in the range @xmath15 to be used in cross - correlation programs such as the kbred environments developed for the vvds @xcite . breaking up",
    "this `` redshift desert '' is critical to reduce the incompleteness of deep redshift surveys , and probe the galaxy population at an important time in the evolution .    in a first pass of redshift measurements of the first epoch spectra of the vvds @xmath0 sample @xcite",
    ", the redshift of @xmath1610% of the galaxies appeared hard to identify while a significant fraction of these spectra had a good continuum s / n .",
    "we have setup an iterative approach to identify these objects , based on the creation of rest - frame galaxy templates going as far as possible toward the uv , bridging the gap between the well observed wavelength range above [ oii]3727@xmath13 and the range below 1800@xmath13 with the templates assembled by shapley et al .",
    "@xcite . these new templates ( see figure 1 )",
    "have been included in our redshift measurement engine kbred and tested against the parent samples of galaxies used to produce them , in the range up to redshift @xmath17 , then up to redshifts @xmath18 and above as new redshifts were being identified .",
    "this approach has been quite successful on test samples , successfully turning up galaxies at redshifts @xmath6 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we are currently going over our data with the expectation to significantly reduce the incompleteness which was observed at the end of our first pass .",
    "a preliminary description of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function out to @xmath17 has been presented in le fvre et al . @xcite . the current vvds data allows to build e.g. the luminosity function and trace its evolution accross many time steps and , furthermore , to break up the population vs. spectral type , or vs. the local galaxy density .    in figure 3",
    ", we present the evolution of the lf of galaxies out to redshift 1.5 , for each of 4 spectral types from early to late types . most of the lf evolution is concentrated in the later types , very strong for the type 4 presented in figure3 , while the lf of early types does not seem to change much over this period .",
    "these results , together with the luminosity density evolution will be discussed extensively in forthcoming papers @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the star formation rate from u to k band data will be compared with the star formation indicators obtained at other wavelengths @xcite , e.g. in the radio @xcite , or in the far uv with galex @xcite .",

    "the vvds has been designed to trace large scale structures out to @xmath19mpc at @xmath20 .",
    "although our current data from the on - going survey does not yet reach these scales , we have assembled a set of redshifts in an area @xmath21arcmin@xmath8 , with @xmath22 of all galaxies to @xmath0 with a measured redshift , which allows a first pass at tracing the large scale structures .",
    "the preliminary redshift histogram of the vvds-0226 - 04 field , shows a dense alternance of strong peaks in the 1d projection ( figure 4 ) . to further detail the 3d distribution of galaxies ,",
    "we have derived the galaxy density field from this data set using the wiener filtering technique with a 3 mpc smoothing scale .",
    "the deep probe in this field extends over more than 3000 mpc , for a total volume sampled of @xmath23mpc .",
    "several slices from this deep probe are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the density field appears to be already significantly clumped by @xmath20 @xcite . as an example",
    ", we show in figure 6 a strong overdensity and very complex structure at @xmath24 spreading accross the full @xmath25mpc@xmath8 of the field .     magnitude limited sample .",

    "the vvds field at 1000 + 03 is now the focus of an extensive observational effort as part of the hst - cosmos program @xcite , including the measurements of more than 50000 redshifts in the @xmath29 area to trace the galaxy density field .",
    "the other vvds survey fields at 1400 + 00 and 2217 + 00 will continue to be the target of the vvds team in future observational campaigns to trace the large scale structure distribution out to @xmath2 in several independent fields .",
    "the vvds is providing for the first time a magnitude limited sample of @xmath30 galaxy redshifts , with @xmath31 redshift in the @xmath5 sample , and @xmath32 in the @xmath33 sample , going successfuly through the `` redshift desert '' @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function up to @xmath2 is traced for several spectral type , with most of the evolution concentrated in the later types .",
    "strong overdensities in the distribution of galaxies are visible over scales in excess of 30mpc up to @xmath2 .",
    "this provides evidence that the galaxy distribution was already strongly structured when the universe was half of its present age .",
