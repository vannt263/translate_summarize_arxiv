    "it could happen that no new particles will be discovered at the tevatron , the lhc and @xmath0 linear colliders @xcite except the sm - like higgs boson . in this case",
    "the main task for new colliders will be to search for signals of new physics via deviations of observed quantities from standard - model predictions .",
    "the study of higgs boson production at a photon collider @xcite offers excellent opportunities for this @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the sm and in its extensions , all fundamental charged particles contribute to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 effective couplings .",
    "besides , these couplings are absent in the sm at tree level , appearing only at the loop level .",
    "therefore , the background for signals of new physics will be relatively lower here than in processes which are allowed at tree level of the sm .",
    "we assume @xcite that an sm - like scenario is realized , i.e. , the higgs particle has been found at the tevatron or the lhc and its partial widths or coupling constants squared are precisely measured ( mainly at the @xmath0 linear collider ) , being in agreement with those of the sm , within the anticipated experimental accuracies .",
    "this can happen not only in the sm , but also if nature is described by some other theory , for example , the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "here we compare the sm and the sm - like scenario in the 2hdm  ( ii ) .",
    "the _ sm - like scenario _ can be defined by the following criteria :    * one higgs boson will be discovered with mass above today s limit for an sm higgs boson , 115  gev @xcite .",
    "this can be either the higgs boson of the sm or one neutral higgs boson from some other model . *",
    "no other higgs boson will be discovered .",
    "any other higgs boson is weakly coupled with the @xmath6 boson , gluons and quarks , or sufficiently heavy to escape observation : @xmath7 @xcite . * any other new particle that may exist is beyond the discovery limits of lhc and the @xmath0 linear collider . *",
    "the measured decay widths of this higgs boson ( or coupling constants squared ) to quarks , charged leptons , electroweak gauge bosons and gluons , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , will be in agreement with their sm values @xmath10 within the experimental precision , @xmath11 .",
    "at the tesla @xmath0 collider the discussed production cross sections are expected to be measured with a significantly higher precision than at the lhc @xcite . at @xmath12 , with integrated luminosity 500  fb@xmath13 one can expect for the basic couplings the following relative accuracy @xcite : @xmath14 experiments at photon colliders open new perspectives . even with a modest integrated luminosity of a @xmath1 collider in the high energy peak of about @xmath15  fb@xmath13 , a @xmath1 collider makes it possible to obtain the accuracy in measuring @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 to be compared to 13% at a linear collider at 500  fb@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy in the measurement of the effective @xmath5 ( @xmath18 ) coupling in the process @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is lower .",
    "we will use the above uncertainties to constrain ratios of actual ( in principle measurable ) coupling constants of each neutral higgs scalar @xmath21 ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) of the 2hdm ( ii ) in the sm - like realizations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ] with particle @xmath24 to the corresponding value for the higgs boson in the sm , @xmath25    the allowed ranges for @xmath26 are constrained by the experimental accuracies @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "additional constraints follow from the structure of the considered model .",
    "we here consider the cp - conserving two - higgs - doublet model in its model  ii implementation , denoted by 2hdm  ( ii ) @xcite . here , one doublet of fundamental scalar fields couples to @xmath29-type quarks , the other to @xmath30-type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the higgs sector contains three neutral higgs particles , two cp - even scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 , one cp - odd ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath31 , and charged higgs bosons @xmath32  it coincides in the 2hdm  ( ii ) and in the mssm .    in the sm - like scenario realized in the 2hdm",
    "we need to consider both possibilities : not only the light scalar higgs boson , @xmath22 , but also the heavier one , @xmath23 , could imitate the sm higgs boson if the lighter scalar @xmath22 escapes detection @xcite .",
    "the ratios of the direct coupling constants of the higgs bosons @xmath33 to the gauge bosons @xmath34 or @xmath6 bosons , to up and down quarks and to charged leptons , relative to their sm values can be expressed via angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 parameterizes the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two basic higgs doublets and @xmath39 parameterizes mixing among the two neutral cp - even higgs fields .    the coupling of the charged higgs boson to the neutral scalars @xmath21 depends on the higgs - boson masses and on the additional parameter @xmath40 ( compare @xcite , note that the paper @xcite uses another parameterization of the 2hdm ) @xmath41",
    "the quantities @xmath42 for the couplings ( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) of each scalar ( referred to below as basic couplings ) are closely related to the observables and it is more natural to use them , instead of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . since for each @xmath21 these three @xmath43 can be expressed in terms of _ two _ angles , they fulfill a simple relation _ ( pattern relation ) _ , which plays a basic role in our analysis ( it is valid in the mssm as well ) .",
    "it has the same form for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 , namely @xmath44 , or @xmath45 furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) follows the condition : @xmath46 .    in the following discussion",
    "we will assume only one value for each up - type quark , down - type quark , charged lepton and gauge boson coupling with the higgs boson , in numerical calculation we will use the best estimate for each category , e.g. @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",

    "the @xmath1 width looks the most promising one for distinguishing models .    _",

    "the contributions of @xmath86 and @xmath87-quark loops are of opposite sign , i.e. , they partially compensate each other , thus , the effect of scalar loops is enhanced here .",
    "the coupling @xmath88 depends on @xmath40 , which is not fixed by the observable masses .",
    "this dependence is linear : @xmath89 with a similar dependence for the @xmath90 decay .    for _ the solutions @xmath58 _ the coupling of the charged higgs boson @xmath32 to the observed neutral one , @xmath91 , is practically independent of @xmath40 since @xmath92 .",
    "also , if the charged higgs boson @xmath32 is heavy ( as is the case in the sm - like scenario ) , its coupling to the neutral higgs scalars @xmath21 is close to that of the vector bosons , @xmath93 . for solutions @xmath94 the main difference in the two - photon width from that of the sm",
    "is given by the contribution of charged higgs bosons , for the solution @xmath95 also in the change of sign of the coupling to the @xmath87-quark as compared to the sm case .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the ratio of the two - photon higgs widths to the sm value for the solutions @xmath31 ( left ) and @xmath58 ( right ) . for the solutions",
    "@xmath31 these curves correspond to the case @xmath96 .",
    "solid curves correspond to the `` exact '' case with @xmath97 , for @xmath98 .",
    "as discussed above , these curves are below unity due to the contribution of the charged higgs boson , and for the solution @xmath95 , also due to the `` wrong '' sign of the @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) coupling .",
    "the shaded bands are derived from the anticipated 1  @xmath101 bounds around the sm values of _ two _ measured basic coupling constants : for the solution @xmath31 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , for solution @xmath104 ( @xmath95 ) for @xmath105 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the third basic coupling is , by virtue of the pattern equation , much closer to the sm value than the corresponding anticipated error for this quantity .    in table  2",

    ".summary of the solutions and sm - like realizations .",
    "the last three columns give ratios of loop - induced partial widths to their sm values at @xmath107  gev for the sm - like scenarios in the 2hdm  ( ii ) in the `` exact '' case ( @xmath97 ) .",

    "the possible precision in the determination of @xmath40 from the two - photon width depends on the mass of the charged higgs boson .",
    "the deviations of the @xmath80 width from its sm value was found to be lower than that of the two photon width , see table  2 .",
    "the two - gluon width is determined by the contributions of @xmath87 and @xmath109 quarks . for not too high values of @xmath110 , the @xmath87-quark contribution dominates .",

    "the two - gluon width can differ from its sm value by more than the expected experimental uncertainty ( 5.5% at the linear collider ) , and the measurement of the two - gluon width could exclude the sm - like scenario from being realized by the 2hdm . in such a case",
    "the photon collider can be used for a more detailed study of the realized non - standard higgs sector .",
    "an sm - like scenario observed at the lhc and @xmath0 linear colliders can occur both in the sm and in other models , including the 2hdm  ( ii ) . in order to distinguish these models ,",
    "we implement a pattern relation among basic couplings which is valid in the 2hdm and in the mssm . taking into account",
    "anticipated uncertainties in future measurements of the basic couplings of the higgs boson , we found that the considered sm - like scenario ( in which partial widths of higgs boson decay are close to their sm values ) has three types of allowed realizations .",
    "the comparison of the presented results for the two - photon width with the anticipated experimental uncertainty ( [ jik ] ) shows that the deviation of the two - photon width ratio from unity is generally large enough to allow a reliable distinction of the 2hdm  ( ii ) from the sm at a photon collider . for the solutions @xmath58",
    "this conclusion is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath40 and arbitrary masses of other ( unobserved ) higgs bosons . for the solutions @xmath31 , according to eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) , this conclusion is valid in a wide range of values @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
