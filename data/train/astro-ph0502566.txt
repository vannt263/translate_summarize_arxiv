    "in an attempt to place quantitative constraints on models of planet formation , we developed an algorithm to simulate the kinematic properties of gas giants formed in isolation ( ida & lin 2004a , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this prescription is based on the sequential accretion model in which we assume that jupiter - mass gas - giant planets formed through 1 ) grain condensation , 2 ) runaway planetesimal coagulation @xcite , 3 ) oligarchic growth of protoplanetary embryos @xcite , and 4 ) gas accretion onto solid cores ( embryos ) @xcite . based on a distribution of 1 )",

    "in addition , we considered the effect of post formation type - ii orbital migration due to planet - disk interaction @xcite which is an important process in relocating protoplanets away from their birth places .",
    "the last process has been invoked @xcite to account for the origin of a population of jupiter - mass short - period planets such as 51 peg b @xcite .",
    "we compared the results of our simulation with the available data of extrasolar planets .",
    "we suggested that around solar - type stars , 1 ) there may be a deficit of intermediate - mass ( @xmath2 ) and intermediate - period ( @xmath3yr ) in their mass - period distribution ( paper i ) , 2 ) the frequency of gas giant planets may be an increasing function of their host stars metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath4 ( ida & lin 2004b , hereafter paper ii ) , and 3 ) a large fraction of the planets migrated to the proximity of their host stars may have perished ( paper i , ii ) .",
    "the first conclusion results directly from the expectation that a ) the growth of protoplanetary cores is limited by dynamical isolation in the inner regions of planetary systems and slow coagulation rate in the outer regions , b ) even under the most favorable locations , @xmath5 myr is needed for the formation of protoplanetary embryos ( cores ) , anywhere in the disk , with masses @xmath6 , c ) cores with mass larger than @xmath7 several @xmath8 can undergo runaway gas accretion , and d ) orbital migration occurs on a similar time scale ( @xmath9 ) to gas depletion in the disk ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the model we have presented so far provides the first step in the construction of deterministic properties of planetary formation .",
    "its simplistic assumptions must be re - examined in a wider context of protoplanetary environment .",
    "for example , planets are assumed to form independently and in isolation in the model .",
    "dynamical isolation in this context means that there are no other major planets around the same host stars .",
    "most importantly , post - formation dynamical interaction between the planets have not yet been considered .",
    "while these effects will be examined in a future investigation , we consider here the mass function of dynamically - isolated planets and its dependence on the mass of the host star .    on the observational side ,",
    "most of the known planets are found around solar - type stars ( g dwarf stars ) because the most successful radial velocity surveys have been conducted for these target stars which have cool and well defined atmospheric spectroscopic features .",
    "however , the search window is rapidly expanding to lower - mass stars as detection techniques are being refined in both radial velocity and transit searches .",
    "figure [ fig : obs ] shows the distributions of semimajor axis ( @xmath10 ) and mass ( @xmath11 ) of discovered extrasolar planets around m , k , g , and f stars .",
    "the planets around subgiants are excluded , because the relation between stellar spectral - type and its mass is different from that for main sequence stars .",
    "the planets discovered by transit survey are also excluded , because the transit survey has different observational bias in planetary periods from that of doppler survey . although much more planets have been discovered around g stars than around f and k stars , the detection probability ( after correction of metallicity dependence )",
    "is similar among these stars ( fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "however , the detection probability may be by order of magnitude lower around m stars .",
    "since their signals are the most conspicuous , close - in planets are expected to be the first to be uncovered ( narayan _ et al .",
    "however , until recently , the only planets discovered around m stars are two jupiter mass planets with moderate semimajor axis ( 0.13au , 0.21au ) around gliese 876 .",
    "no jupiter - mass close - in planets have been discovered around m stars .",
    "recently , a short - period ( 2.6 days ) neptune - mass ( @xmath12 ) planet is found to be orbiting around an m - dwarf ( @xmath13 ) gj436 @xcite . with a mass between those of gas giants and the earth",
    ", this finding signifies a transition in the quest to search for terrestrial planets . in the solar system , two ice giants , uranus and neptune ,",
    "have masses in this range .",
    "these planets are primarily composed of icy cores with a modest gaseous envelope . in accordance with the core accretion scenario , e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "the cores in the outer solar system take a long time to emerge and when they finally acquired @xmath14 , the solar nebula was already so severely depleted that they can only accreted a small amount of gaseous envelope @xcite .",
    "it is natural to extrapolate that gj436b may also have attained @xmath14 but failed to accrete much gas .",
    "the main challenge to such a scenario is to account for the origin of both its low mass and short period .",
    "the period of the first extrasolar gas giant planet ( 51 peg b ) discovered @xcite around a main sequence star outside the solar system is comparable to that of gj436b .",
    "that planet and dozens others like it are thought to have formed through sequential accretion beyond the ice boundary and migrated to their present locations @xcite as a consequence of their tidal interaction with their nascent gaseous disks @xcite .",
    "but , the much lower mass @xmath15 of gj436b implies that gas accretion onto it may have been greatly suppressed prior to , during , and after its migration .",
    "two other short - period neptune - mass planets have been found around g dwarfs ( a planet with 2.8 day period and @xmath16 mass around 55 cnc and that with 9.6 day period and @xmath17 mass around hd 160691 ) @xcite . since 55cnc and hd160691",
    "have three and two other giant planets ( maybe gas giants ) , these neptune - mass planets could form _ in situ _ by accumulation of rocky materials caused by sweeping mean motion resonance associated with migration of a giant planet , e.g. , @xcite or sweeping secular resonance associated with disk gas depletion , e.g. , @xcite . since we do not include interaction from other major planets , formation of these neptune - mass planets",
    "is beyond scope of the present paper . on the other hand ,",
    "no gas giant planets has been found around gj436 .",
    "gj436b is dynamically - isolated , so that its formation must be considered without help of other giant planet(s ) and our calculation in the present paper can address its formation .",
    "although in the present paper , we will propose a scenario that type ii migration of a neptune - mass planet occurs without significant gas accretion onto the planet around an m star , there are several other potential scenarios for the origins of dynamically - isolated , close - in neptune - mass planets .",
    "@xcite suggested that , along with jupiter and saturn , uranus and neptune were formed through gravitational instability , in a massive disk .",
    "heavy elements settled to form the cores and the gas envelope ( clump ) was greatly depleted by the photo - evaporation due to the uv flux from nearby ob stars before it contracts to planetary size .",
    "since gravitational instability is unlikely at the present location ( 0.028au ) of gj436b , the planet must have migrated from outer region by tidal interaction of the disk . however , the gravitational potential of disks around m stars is shallower than that around g stars such that the evaporation of the envelope of collapsing clumps would also eliminate all the residual gas in the disk",
    ". it would be difficult for the collapsing fragment to lose a large fraction of their mass and migrate extensively to form a gj436b - like planet .",
    "on the other hand , under some extreme circumstance , the sporadic uv and x - ray irradiation from its host star could evaporate envelope of a gas giant planet that has migrated from outer region during m star s main sequence lifetime .",
    "but the overall impact of the photoevaporation process on planet s envelope and mass has not been determined .    under the general concept of sequential accretion scenario , dynamically - isolated close - in planets",
    "may also form _ in situ _ @xcite .",
    "this scenario requires a concentration of planetesimals in the stellar proximity .",
    "one possible mechanism which may lead to such a situation is through embryo - disk interaction , or commonly known as type - i migration @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of building blocks for close - in planets also requires the termination of their migration process and the interaction between the embryos with their host stars as well as residual planetesimals .    through a case study",
    ", we consider in this paper the origin of dynamically - isolated close - in planets of @xmath18 neptune mass around stars with various masses . with the model developed in paper",
    "i and ii , we show that neptune - mass close - in planets may be abundant around m stars . in  2 , we briefly recapitulate the sequential accretion hypothesis . using our prescription ,",
    "we first compare the mass function of dynamically - isolated close - in versus modest to long - period planets around solar - type stars ( g dwarfs ) in  3 .",
    "this comparison is useful because we have most observational data and constraints for planets around solar - type stars at the present moment .",
    "based on the best available observed properties of pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks of different - mass stars and accretion rates onto their host stars , we construct disk models around main sequence stars with various masses . in ",
    "4 , we construct a conventional model of giant planet formation around lowest - mass stars and show that icy planets with 10-@xmath19 accrete from planetesimals at @xmath20au without any significant gas accretion onto the planets .",
    "these neptune - mass planets can also readily migrate to the proximity of the stellar surface , where gas accretion is quenched at neptune - mass . through a series of simulations , we show , in  5 , that the disk mass dependence on their host stars mass and the criteria of tidally induced migration in the disk",
    "may be quantitatively constrained by the mass distribution of short - period planets .",
    "we also place constraints , in  6 , on the dependence of disk mass on the stellar mass .",
    "finally , in  7 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the detailed description of sequential accretion scenario and our prescription to simulate the formation of planets are given in paper i. we briefly recapitulate the central features of our approach and define various quantities which are used in the discussions of our results .",
    "in the sequential accretion scenario , planetesimals grow into protoplanetary embryos ( cores ) which affects the velocity dispersion @xmath21 of nearby planetesimals and modifies their own growth @xcite .",

    ", we focused our discussion on the mass function of close - in planets around stars with various masses , in particular lower masses than the solar mass , because its origin is determined by the delicate balance of various processes and they are the most conspicuous companions of nearby stars .",
    "although many ( @xmath265 ) planets which once migrated to the proximity of their host stars may be eliminated ( paper ii ) , we can compare the mass distribution of close - in planets among around stars with various masses .",
    "if the elimination factor is taken into account , rough comparison is also possible between close - in and more distant planets .      1 .",
    "dynamically - isolated , close - in , neptune - mass planets with silicate and iron cores can form in relatively massive disks around solar - type stars .",
    "but their frequency is expected to be an order of magnitude smaller than that of close - in jupiter - mass planets .",
    "dynamically - isolated , close - in , neptune - mass ice giants can form in lower - mass stars .",
    "their frequency peaks around the m dwarfs . since the luminosity of m dwarfs is weak , the ice boundary is located well inside 1 au .",
    "these planets are formed at around 1au but outside the ice boundary and their cores are primarily composed of volatile ices .",
    "planets which migrated to the stellar proximity with masses in the range of @xmath266 may acquire , _ in situ _",
    ", a limited amount of additional gas , but gas accretion is immediately quenched by gap formation because of small aspect ratio of the disk in the proximity of the host star .",
    "because these planets compose mostly of icy material and m stars luminosity is relatively weak , they may have water - vapor atmosphere and water ocean @xcite .",
    "3 .   embryos with mass lower than @xmath267 can not migrate to the proximity of their f , g , and k dwarf host stars through type ii migration .",
    "detection of dynamically - isolated earth - mass close - in planets may be attributed to type i migration of low - mass embryos @xcite , sweeping secular resonances @xcite , or sweeping mean motion resonances . around late m dwarfs ,",
    "however , dynamically - isolated , a few earth - mass planets can form with temperature comparable to that of the earth .",
    "4 .   around m dwarfs",
    ", the formation probability of gas giants is much reduced .",
    "the relatively low @xmath22 prevents the emergence of sufficiently massive cores prior to the severe depletion of gas in their nascent disks , which is consistent with the results by @xcite .",
    "the mass function of close - in planets generally have two peaks at about neptune mass and at about jupiter mass .",
    "the lower - mass peak takes the maximum frequency for m stars , while the higher - mass peak is much more pronounced around higher - mass stars ( f , g , k dwarfs ) .",
    "these are because planets tend to undergo type ii migration after fully accreting gas around the higher - mass stars while they tend to migrate faster than gas accretion around m stars . unless the termination location of planetary migration is a decreasing function of @xmath24 , close - in neptune - mass planets around m dwarfs are easier to detect than those around g dwarfs .",
    "6 .   the mass function of dynamically - isolated close - in planets around stars with various masses can also be used to calibrate the sufficient condition for the onset of planetary migration and for the termination of gas accretion due to planet - disk tidal interaction .",
    "the metallicity dependence on frequency of extrasolar gas giant planets may not be easily accounted for by the gravitational instability scenario , e.g. , @xcite , while it is naturally accounted for by the sequential core accretion scenario that we are based on ( paper ii ) .",
    "the condition of the gravitational instability is @xmath268 , and its radial wavelength @xmath269 @xcite where @xmath270 .",
    "hence , the instability may be more limited and result in smaller clumps around lower - mass stars , which could account for the above features 4 and 5 , if @xmath271 is assumed as in the standard series in the present paper . however ,",
    "if @xmath272 , the gravitational instability scenario can not account for the above features 4 and 5 , while the sequential core accretion scenario still shows the tendency for the features .",
    "more detailed study on the dependence of disk mass on stellar mass @xmath24 is needed .",
    "our work is primarily motivated by the discovery of gj436b @xcite .",
    "our theoretical extrapolations can be tested with the following statistical properties of close - in planets to be discovered by various techniques .    1 .",
    "as mentioned above , the mass function of dynamically - isolated close - in planets as a function of the spectral classes of their host stars is particularly useful in the determination of the growth , migration , and disk depletion time scales .",
    "2 .   a comparison between the frequencies of gas giants with close - in orbits and",
    "those with extended orbits can provide constraints on the migration condition , survival criteria , and disk mass as functions of the host stars mass .",
    "3 .   in systems with multiple giant planets ,",
    "the dynamical architecture may provide clues on whether the migration of the close - in planets are driven by planet - disk tidal interaction or sweeping secular resonance .",
    "a comparison of atmospheric properties of close - in neptune - mass planets around g dwarfs to that around m dwarfs can verify the conjecture that the former have silicate and iron cores whereas the latter have ice cores .      1",
    ".   a spatially resolved image of disks can directly provide information of @xmath22 and the temperature distribution around any given host star .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 on the mass of the host stars determines the functional form of @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   a relation between the disk mass and accretion rate onto the host stars places a constraint on the rate of type ii migration . 4 .",
    "a direct measurement of the gas distribution is particularly important in determining @xmath1 and @xmath48 .      1 .",
