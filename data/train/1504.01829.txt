    ".    an important part of the paper deals with the range when the size of the hypergraph is @xmath26 where the relation to the brown , erds , and ss conjecture is clear , however , finding sharp bounds on @xmath27 is an interesting open problem for any edge densities .",

    "<S> the main result of this paper is that for any @xmath0 and for large enough @xmath1 if the number of edges in a 3-uniform hypergraph is at least @xmath2 then there is a core ( subgraph with minimum degree at least 2 ) on at most 15 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that our result is not sharp and 15 can be replaced by 9 . </S>",
    "<S> such an improvement seems to be out of reach , since it would imply the following case of a long - standing conjecture by brown , erds , and ss ; if there is no set of 9 vertices that span at least 6 edges of a 3-uniform hypergraph then it is sparse . </S>"
