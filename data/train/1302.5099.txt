    "( strain broadening parameters @xmath15 ) we find that the @xmath16 parameter is the largest and increases the most down to @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of the @xmath17-interplane distances is the broadest and highly affected when approaching @xmath11 from above , while the @xmath9 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) interplane - distance distributions are much narrower and less temperature dependent .",
    "qualitatively , the @xmath16 strains in the monoclinic structure may originate from minute shifts of the mn - mn spin - chains along the @xmath21 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , a lattice distortion that relieves the frustration and could effectively lead to the previously proposed @xmath22 triclinic structure at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the isostructural cumno@xmath2 @xcite , the high - resolution synchrotron xrd patterns of below @xmath11 , similar to npd , do not show any resolvable peak splitting that would unambiguously confirm a bulk phase transformation to the lower - symmetry triclinic phase ( see methods ) .",
    "surprisingly , rietveld refinements at @xmath23 on the highly parametrised , strained triclinic phase ( t ) produce a statistically poorer quality of fit compared to the strained monoclinic ( m ) phase , @xmath24 ( see methods ) . a close inspection of the fitted patterns reveals asymmetrically broadened profiles in terms of the peak shape , where the calculated pattern systematically misses intensity from the low- and high - angle tails of certain bragg reflections ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) . given the intrinsic resolution difference between npd and xrd , such a pattern complexity could not have been revealed by the early npd ( see methods ) that was fitted satisfactorily by the triclinic model @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron xrd data , therefore , suggests that a more complex parametrization of the structural model is required .",
    "presence of stacking faults @xcite or structural inhomogeneities @xcite in otherwise single - phase materials , may be the reason for the development of short - scale regions , which can give rise to unusually broadened profiles , like those of . to inspect these ,",
    "haadf - stem was used at room temperature .",
    "large faultless regions that give rise to distinct diffraction spots indexed in the @xmath13 symmetry , are found ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , d ) . however , these are broken by planar defects that entail coherent mirror twins separated by twin boundaries and stacking faults ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) .",
    "such planar defects are not expected to evolve notably with decreasing temperature , while , in contrast , the @xmath16 strain broadening parameter increases significantly from room temperature down to @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "simulations of the diffraction profile resulting from such defects ( see methods ) yield anisotropic peak broadening ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]f , g ) that could partially contribute to the 30  k experimentally observed @xmath14-dependent anisotropic broadening of bragg reflections .",
    "however , the simulations show that defects of both types fail completely to explain the strongly asymmetric peak shape of certain bragg reflections , for example , @xmath25 , and are thus incapable of describing the synchrotron xrd data below @xmath11 .",
    "a way of simulating such a behaviour is by a two - phase ( 2p ) rietveld model accounting for a nanoscale coexistence of the monoclinic and the triclinic phases .",
    "this model provides significantly improved quality of fit , @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , e ) .",
    "the obtained volume fraction of the triclinic phase is @xmath2735(1)@xmath28 at 30  k and only marginally evolves down to 5  k. the majority monoclinic phase retains some strain , but this is severely relieved below @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) , where the two phases coexists .",
    "randomly distributed nanoscale inhomogeneities , pertaining to the minority triclinic phase that is grown at the expense of the majority monoclinic phase , may severely modify the electronic response ( _ vide infra _ ) of the bulk compound .",
    "this renders it an intriguing subject for magnetic local - probe investigations .",
    "* magnetic inhomogeneity revealed by nmr . * to validate the apparent phase separation and associated local inhomogeneities in @xmath1-namno@xmath2 , we employed the nmr technique , locally probing electronic charge and magnetic environment of the @xmath29na ( @xmath30 ) nuclei through their quadrupolar coupling with the electric field gradient and hyperfine coupling with the electronic spins , respectively .",
    "the scaling of the central transition ( @xmath31 ) nmr line shift @xmath32 ( due to isotopic hyperfine coupling ) and the line width @xmath33 ( due to the anisotropic hyperfine coupling ) with bulk susceptibility @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "they both originate from local static hyperfine magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , they are expected to scale linearly with @xmath34 , not only in the paramagnetic state but also below @xmath11 , because the local fields from antiferromagnetically ordered mn@xmath6 moments at sites @xmath35 @xcite effectively cancel out at the @xmath29na position with @xmath36 site symmetry .",
    "the apparent low - temperature non - linearity @xmath37 that is not due to quadrupolar - broadening effects ( see methods ) discloses a more complicated magnetic order than initially proposed @xcite .",
    "we stress that @xmath33 does not exhibit an order - parameter - like dependence below @xmath11 ; hence , it can not be explained by a small additional spin component that would break the symmetry at the @xmath29na sites .    a sudden suppression of the @xmath29na nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath38 at @xmath11 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b proves that nmr is sensitive to low - energy magnetic excitations and that the magnetic transition is sharp and occurs instantaneously throughout the sample .",
    "we find that the stretch exponent of the nuclear - magnetization recovery curves in the @xmath39 experiment ( see methods ) that is constant , @xmath40 , at @xmath41 dramatically decreases in the magnetically ordered state and reaches the value @xmath42 at lowest temperatures .",
    "this is a fingerprint of an increased distribution width of @xmath38 , and hence a broadened distribution of local environments , signalling an inhomogenous magnetic ground state of @xmath1-namno@xmath2 .    the inhomogenous magnetic ground state is further supported by a sudden drop of the nmr intensity below @xmath11 by @xmath43 ( fig .  [ fig3]c ) .",
    "as the nmr intensity should normally scale with @xmath44 due to the boltzmann population factor , this partial nmr wipeout can only be attributed to an unobservable nmr component accompanying the remaining nmr component that is characterized by a zero static local magnetic field .",
    "nmr thus clearly discloses a magnetic phase separation below @xmath11 .",
    "* @xmath12sr detection of magnetic inhomogeneity . * to expose the microscopic nature of the magnetic phase separation below @xmath11 , we finally resort to @xmath12sr that is extremely sensitive to local magnetic fields @xmath45 , and directly measures their distribution in an ordered state through the relaxation function @xmath46 of the muon polarization @xcite . below @xmath11 , levelling of @xmath46 at @xmath47 for longer times ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) that is characteristic for powder samples with randomly oriented internal magnetic field with respect to initial muon polarization , is a clear indication that the bulk of the sample has undergone a transition into the ordered state .",
    "early - time oscillations , on the other hand , reveal that two inequivalent muon stopping sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 exist .",
    "the occupation probabilities for the two sites @xmath50:@xmath51:@xmath52 are temperature independent and the corresponding internal fields at 2  k are @xmath53  mt and @xmath54  mt .",
    "we emphasize that the satisfactory fitting of the experimental muon polarization curve recorded at 5  k to a model of two damped cosine contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) reveals a large difference between the longitudinal @xmath55  s@xmath56 and the transverse @xmath57  s@xmath56 , @xmath58  s@xmath56 muon relaxation rates .",
    "the former is of dynamical origin , while the latter additionally encompasses a distribution of static local fields @xcite .",
    "this distribution is obviously responsible for the fast damping of oscillations and must originate from the inhomogenous magnetic state . to model it , the knowledge of muon stopping sites is required . here , we rely on _ ab initio _ calculations ( see methods ) , which predict the two most likely muon stopping sites @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; the former corresponds to the global electrostatic - potential minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "the calculated dipolar fields ( see methods ) from antiferromagnetically ordered mn@xmath6 moments at these sites match the experimentally determined fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the broad local - magnetic - field distributions at the muon stopping sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 provide a microscopic insight to the inhomogenous magnetic state of @xmath1-namno@xmath2 .",
    "most importantly , they can be related to the `` parasitic '' triclinic structural phase suggested by the synchrotron xrd .",
    "we could model ( see methods ) these field distributions by introducing triclinic magnetic defects in the form of dispersed nano - sized islands with the magnetic order reversed at the interfaces with the monoclinic matrix , as schematically presented in fig .",
    "although the domain walls in magnets tend to be chiral and possess a finite width @xcite , we envisage that this width will be small in @xmath1-namno@xmath2 , because of its rather large magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sketch of the inhomogenous ground state in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a should be a good approximation of the actual situation .",
    "we have considered the magnetic defect regions to be either one- ( 1d ) , two- ( 2d ) , or three - dimensional ( 3d ) objects with a characteristic size @xmath63 , randomly positioned in the lattice so that a given fraction @xmath64 of mn@xmath6 ions resides in them .",
    "independent on their dimensionality , when @xmath65 ( corresponding to stripe- and slab - shifts for 1d and 2d magnetic defects , respectively , as well as for the observed structural twin boundaries and stacking faults ) we find narrow local - field distributions with only a few well - defined frequencies ( fig .  [ fig4]d ) .",
    "these are manifested in beating ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) rather than in experimentally observed damping of @xmath46 . on the other hand , for finite @xmath63",
    "the field distributions become much broader ( fig .  [",
    "fig4]d ) and , consequently , result in heavily damped @xmath46 , in accord with the experiment .",
    "for @xmath66 , as derived from the structural analysis , we can reproduce the experimental @xmath46 at 5  k rather well with @xmath67  ( fig .  [ fig4]a ) , independent of the defect dimensionality , though the 3d model yields the best agreement with the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) .",
    "the agreement of our modelling with the experiment is very good , bearing in mind that @xmath63 is the only free parameter once the parameter @xmath64 is fixed to the value inferred from xrd .",
    "even better quality of modelling could possibly be achieved by further complicating the model with a distribution of defect sizes @xmath63 or a finite width of phase boundaries ( domain walls ) . however , at this point , such complications seem unnecessary , as our approach already captures the main features of @xmath12sr polarization decay and thus unambiguously demonstrates the presence of nanoscopic magnetic domains in @xmath1-namno@xmath2 , with well - defined average size .",
    "the dispersed finite - size defects are in conformity with the short - range ordered regions inferred by neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "we note that the correlation length deduced from the neutron diffraction experiments at 5  k appears somewhat smaller ; however , it is likely underestimated considering the amount of diffuse scattering at this temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath67  is in good accordance with the correlation length derived from the diffuse neutron peak in the temperature range between 15  k and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "moreover , introduction of magnetostructural defects also explains the sudden @xmath2730% decrease of the nmr intensity below @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "namely , the defects locally break the inversion symmetry and lead to a two - peak local - field distribution at the @xmath29na sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) .",
    "the dominant peak remains positioned at @xmath68 and is modestly broadened , which may explain the low - temperature deviation of @xmath33 from linearity ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the second peak is found at @xmath69  t , yielding a huge width of the corresponding nmr powder signal ( @xmath70 ; @xmath71  t is the applied magnetic field ) that renders this component unobservable .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 possesses no notable temperature dependence between 2  k and @xmath2730  k , while it slightly decreases at higher temperatures .",
    "its temperature independence below @xmath2730  k clearly indicates that both magnetostructural phases are stable and , therefore , compete over a broad temperature range .",
    "we stress that the observed nanometer - scale inhomogeneity can neither occur solely at grain boundaries since the crystalline grains are several orders of magnitude larger , nor it can originate from the diluted planar structural defects whose topology is different .",
    "we rather argue that this unique state arises from the geometrical frustration of the underlying spin lattice , as a result of the competition between the elastic , magnetic - exchange and magnetoelastic energies . to support this hypothesis , we compare the total energies of the relevant phases , calculated _ ab initio _ within the framework of the density - functional theory ( for technical details , see methods ) .",
    "we considered the monoclinic and triclinic structures in either the nonmagnetic or antiferromagnetic states .",
    "it is assumed that the theoretical nonmagnetic state is equivalent to the experimental paramagnetic state .",
    "the calculations were performed for theoretical equilibrium lattice parameters and relaxed atomic positions .",
    "thus , any structural distortion for nonmagnetic states results in the gain of the elastic energy , whereas the magnetic ordering yields the magnetic - exchange contribution as well as the magnetoelastic contribution . according to the results of these calculations , in the absence of magnetism",
    "the monoclinic phase is energetically more favourable than the triclinic one , in agreement with the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) . in the presence of the long - range antiferromagnetic order",
    "the two magnetic contributions make the triclinic phase more favourable .",
    "the estimated magneto - elastic contribution is of the order of only a few @xmath72 per unit cell ( see methods ) ; hence the increase of the elastic energy due to the monoclinic - to - triclinic transformation , which is a few orders of magnitude larger , must be mainly balanced by the magnetic exchange .",
    "the lowering of the magnetic - exchange energy is associated with the magnetic degeneracy being removed by the triclinic distortion , rendering the two interchain exchange constants alike ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) by 0.2  mev @xcite .",
    "the two opposing effects of similar magnitude lead to near degeneracy of the monoclinic and the triclinic phases @xcite , which enables already infinitesimal quenched disorder to locally lift the inherent frustration of the monoclinic phase .",
    "it thus provides a solid foundation for realization of a multiple - minima free - energy landscape that is required for formation of nanoscale domains .",
    "a similar situation is found in manganites @xcite , but in contrast to @xmath1-namno@xmath2 , polaronic elastomagnetic textures in manganites are born from the coupling of elastic , spin and charge degrees of freedom @xcite and are believed to be due to a martensitic accommodation strain @xcite .    to better understand the mechanism stabilizing the remarkable inhomogenous ground state of @xmath1-namno@xmath2",
    ", we inspect its low - energy magnetic excitations . according to inelastic neutron scattering ,",
    "these should be gapped ( @xmath73  k ) @xcite .",
    "since these measurements can easily miss a quasi - elastic part , we resort to the complementary @xmath29na spin - lattice relaxation , which is governed by inelastic scattering of spin waves below @xmath11 @xcite . in the case of gapped excitations the thermally - activated relaxation rate @xmath74",
    "is expected for @xmath75 , and the power - law dependence @xmath76 for @xmath77 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath78 depends on the dimensionality of the spin - wave dispersion and the number of magnons assisting the relaxation process @xcite .",
    "the expected exponential law with @xmath79  k ( @xmath80 @xcite ) fails completely to fit the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "in clear contrast , the power law with @xmath81 matches the experimental data very well , implying a very small @xmath82 , if any .",
    "deviations from the power law are observed only in a critical region close to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , our @xmath38 measurements clearly witness quasi - elastic magnetic excitations .",
    "sliding of magnetic stripes along the @xmath21 axis costs zero energy in the monoclinic setting due to the frustrated nature of the interchain exchange and is thus the main candidate for the @xmath83 excitations . the individual stripes can shift independently and , therefore , the ensemble of such excitations becomes extended .",
    "as such excitations oppose a uniform magnetic state , they provide a likely rationalization of the observed unique magnetostructural inhomogeneity in @xmath1-namno@xmath2 .",
    "our present findings reach beyond superconducting cuprates , colossal magnetoresistant manganites and other chemically homogenous systems , which provide prominent examples of electronic - charge inhomogeneities that are mainly realized by means of tuning their chemical composition @xcite . in stoichiometric @xmath1-namno@xmath2  with no charge degrees of freedom , we have discovered an inhomogenous ground state solely in the magnetostructural channel .",
    "therefore , we propose that the geometrical frustration on a spin lattice can lead to magnetostructural inhomogeneities , a new paradigm among phase - separated states of highly correlated electron systems .",
    "such a state is likely to materialize in other frustrated magnets comprising near - degenerate crystal structures .",
    "together with the recently discovered inhomogenous charge - cluster glass on a triangular charge lattice of a dopant - free organic conductor @xcite , this validates experimentally the geometrical frustration as a conceptionally novel mechanism that supports inhomogenous ground states , even in the absence of quenched disorder .",
    "* sample . *",
    "all measurements were performed on the same high - quality polycrystalline sample that was used before @xcite .",
    "the rietveld analysis of the high intensity synchrotron xrd data found no deviation from the stoichiometric molecular type . if any impurity phases were present these were at a level below our detection capability of 0.3% in volume .",

    "our sample was sealed in an 1-mm borosilicate glass capillary , prepared inside a he(g)-filled glove - bag .",
    "this procedure permits for a tiny amount of he(g ) trapped in the capillary to operate as an exchange gas that allows for effective thermalisation of the sample down to the base temperature ( 5  k ) , attainable with the continuous flow he - cryostat .",
    "use of this thermal protocol provided excellent reproducibility of the xrd diffractograms on different batches .",

    "<S> inhomogenous magnetic ground states at @xmath4 are rare and poorly understood @xcite , although they have been predicted to appear already in a clean limit ( no quenched disorder ) of frustrated magnets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> geometrical frustration of a spin lattice @xcite is known for provoking novel fundamental phenomena in magnetism , like exotic disordered ground states and fractional spin excitations @xcite . moreover , in improper multiferroics it leads to uniform lattice distortions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ground - state degeneracy of frustrated magnets , in alliance with magnetoelastic coupling , could make the energetic cost of spatial fluctuations low , rendering them `` electronically soft '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are thus perfect candidates for yet unseen ground - state inhomogeneities , emerging solely in the magnetostructural channel </S>",
    "<S> .    the layered @xmath1-namno@xmath2 compound may possess the required properties of such a state . </S>",
    "<S> it represents a spatially anisotropic triangular lattice of @xmath5 ( mn@xmath6 ) spins with dominant intrachain ( @xmath7  k ) and frustrated interchain ( @xmath8k ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions @xcite in the @xmath9 plane ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is dictated by strong single - ion anisotropy @xcite and the frustration renders the magnetic excitations one dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite . both sharp magnetic reflections and diffuse scattering appearing at the same wave vector </S>",
    "<S> were simultaneously observed in neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) , even far below the nel temperature @xmath10  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a coexistence of long- and short - range spin correlations indicates a magnetically inhomogenous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , large and highly anisotropic microstrains in the crystal structure above @xmath11 suggest structural inhomogeneities . they can be thought of as a precursor of the structural phase transition from a monoclinic to a triclinic symmetry , which was previously argued to occur concurrently with the magnetic transition due to magnetoelastic coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no direct evidence for the structural change , marked by splitting of nuclear bragg peaks , has so far been identified . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , all the observed magnetic and structural peculiarities of @xmath1-namno@xmath2  could be fingerprints of an intrinsically inhomogenous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such an `` electronically soft '' state could be related to favourable electrochemical properties of @xmath1-namno@xmath2 , characterized by its relatively high discharge capacity and structural stability found after cycling @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we have utilized high - resolution synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) combined with the atomic - resolution high - angle annular dark - field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( haadf - stem ) to identify previously unseen subtle structural modifications of @xmath1-namno@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate by means of complementary local - probe nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath12sr ) methods that a single - phase stoichiometric @xmath1-namno@xmath2  sample adopts a unique inhomogenous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is an outcome of the geometrical frustration and simultaneously active spin and lattice degrees of freedom , which through a lattice - distorting procedure , endorsed by quasi - elastic magnetic excitations , lead to a spontaneous emergence of competing magnetostructural states at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> this novel paradigm in the context of frustration - driven phase complexity is of conceptual importance in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> it allows better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for a plethora of intriguing quantum phenomena arising from degenerate ground states . </S>"
