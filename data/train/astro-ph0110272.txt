    "the great decrease in specific angular momentum required to bring material from typical galactic radii to the innermost stable orbit round a central black hole indicates that accretion disks are likely present in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "direct evidence for such disks includes the kinematics of maser emission observed on parsec and sub - parsec scales in a few objects @xcite and large asymmetries in the @xmath0  kev iron fluorescence line which may be due to orbital motion in a general relativistic potential @xcite .",
    "some galactic x - ray sources are associated with collimated relativistic jets , suggesting disks occur around stellar - mass compact objects also @xcite . in a few cases , light curves during eclipses by a companion star",
    "indicate an extended structure about the compact object @xcite .",
    "one of the major uncertainties regarding disk accretion is how the angular momentum is lost from incoming material .",
    "a leading candidate mechanism is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , whose importance for accretion disks was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the mri is driven by outward radial transport of angular momentum along magnetic field lines sheared by differential orbital motion . in most previous studies of the instability ,",
    "effects of radiation have been neglected .",
    "it has been found that provided dissipation of the field is negligible and magnetic pressure is much less than gas pressure , the fastest linear mode of the instability grows at near three - quarters the orbital angular frequency @xmath1 , independent of the field orientation .",
    "this mode has a wavelength along the direction parallel to the magnetic field of approximately @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the alfvn speed @xcite . in magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of the non - linear development with imposed axisymmetry",
    ", the instability develops from an initially uniform vertical magnetic field into an exponentially - growing two - channel flow . from spatially - varying fields with zero net vertical flux , short - lived turbulence",
    "is produced @xcite . in three - dimensional mhd calculations",
    ", the mri leads to outward angular momentum transport by long - lasting turbulence with velocity fluctuations smaller than or comparable to the sound speed @xcite .",
    "an initially weak magnetic field grows to a saturated level which is sustained for many orbits despite effects of disk stratification @xcite .",
    "a second major issue regarding disk accretion is how the released gravitational energy is converted into radiation .",
    "the energy released in reaching the innermost stable orbit round a black hole is a significant fraction of the rest energy of the incoming material . in parts of the accretion disk ,",
    "radiation pressure may therefore greatly exceed the ordinary gas pressure due to thermal motions of material particles @xcite .",
    "if the released energy is placed in the gas through viscous or resistive dissipation , radiation may be produced by thermal emission provided the absorption optical depth through the disk is sufficient .",
    "alternatively if the released energy is placed in turbulent motions , the kinetic energy might be converted directly into photon energy by radiative damping .",
    "this occurs when work is done on the radiation in compressing a part of the flow , and photons diffuse away from the region of higher energy density . for linear compressive mhd waves in the absence of rotation , damping may be rapid when the wave period is longer than the time for photons to diffuse across the wavelength @xcite . during linear growth of the axisymmetric mri , radiative",
    "damping may be strong when in addition the pressure in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field exceeds the gas pressure @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of radiation on the non - linear development of the mri . as in the first such studies in the gas pressure dominated regime @xcite ,",
    "we assume axisymmetry , neglect vertical stratification , and consider a small patch in the interior of the disk . the dependence of the magnetic stresses on the gas and radiation pressures can not be determined from such axisymmetric calculations lacking sustained dynamo activity .",
    "however , radiation diffusion and the inclusion of magnetic pressures exceeding gas pressure may lead to new effects .",

    "however , we have found that this treatment results in a changing net azimuthal magnetic flux , whereas the azimuthal component of the field evolution equation  [ eqn : induction ] integrated over the periodic shearing sheet indicates that azimuthal flux ought to be conserved when radial flux is zero @xcite . in trial calculations of the development of magnetized turbulence in a shearing - sheet configuration , azimuthal flux varied by up to 20% when azimuthal field was evolved as a scalar , and by a fraction of a percent when all components were treated using the method of characteristics with constrained transport ( moc - ct ; stone & norman 1992b ) .",

    "the radiation flux in an atmosphere with density inhomogeneities may exceed the eddington flux , with low - density regions pushed up by radiation while high - density regions are pulled down by gravity @xcite .",
    "the clumpy state of the canonical calculation during the turbulent stage differs from the two - phase equilibrium proposed by @xcite in having densities continuously distributed around a single most - common value ( figure  [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "the clumps here are formed , confined , and destroyed by the magnetic field , and have lifetimes around one orbital period .",
    "we have included neither the magnetic dissipation heating and compton cooling which might establish a long - lived hot phase , nor the thermal conduction which might set the size of cold - phase clumps .",
    "large - scale buoyancy effects , which may enhance the overall cooling rate , do not appear in our calculations since the vertical component of gravity is neglected .",
    "ordinary convection might prove as effective as diffusion in cooling a radiation - dominated @xmath58-disk @xcite .",
    "although stratification is not included here , the photon bubble instability @xcite could be present locally where turbulent accelerations have components parallel to the radiation flux . for sufficiently large fluxes , linear photon bubble modes with wavelengths somewhat shorter than the mri characteristic wavelength can grow faster than the mri @xcite .",
    "however the similarities in gas and magnetic fluctuations between the canonical simulation r1 and the simulation without radiation having the same initial gas pressure , n11 , suggest the resolved wavelengths of the photon bubble instability are not important in this instance .",
    "it is unclear how well convective and photon bubble modes grow under sustained vertical gravity in a background of turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "we performed axisymmetric radiation mhd simulations of the mri in local patches of a radiation - dominated accretion disk , neglecting the vertical component of gravity . on initially - uniform magnetic fields with a strong azimuthal component ,",
    "radiation diffusion reduced the growth rates of the linear modes in detailed agreement with the analysis by @xcite . on initially vertical fields ,",
    "the non - linear development of the instability led to channel solutions in which compression of the dense layers was hastened by diffusive loss of radiation pressure support . on magnetic fields with zero net vertical flux ,",
    "the non - linear development resulted in about ten orbits of decaying turbulence .",
    "because these axisymmetric calculations showed no sustained dynamo action , the results can not be used to learn the steady - state strength of the magnetic field .",
    "when magnetic pressure was bigger than gas pressure and the distance that radiation diffused in an orbit was at least comparable to the characteristic mri wavelength , density contrasts as large as the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure were driven by magnetic forces .",
    "overdense regions were destroyed and reformed in the turbulence about once per orbit .",
    "diffusion of radiation out of the compressed regions led to partial separation of gas and radiation . in cases with the standard free - free and electron scattering opacities , the gas remained in good thermal contact with the radiation , and both were approximately isothermal .",
    "the flow was heated by radiation damping of compressive turbulent motions .",
    "heating was fastest in regions where the compression rate and radiation diffusion rate were similar .",
    "angular momentum was transported outwards by a total accretion stress approximately four times the pressure in the vertical component of the magnetic field . at fixed vertical field strength ,",
    "the stress showed little dependence on the gas and radiation pressures .",
    "the accretion stresses and heating rates in calculations with initial magnetic pressure comparable to radiation pressure were similar to the viscous stresses and dissipation rates assumed in the @xmath58-disk model used to select the initial conditions .",
    "strong clumping of the gas occurring at such magnetic pressures might allow more rapid cooling of radiation - dominated disks than in the commonly assumed case of uniform density .",
