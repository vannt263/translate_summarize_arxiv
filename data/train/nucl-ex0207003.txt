    "for a number of years narrow structures have been observed in hadronic spectra .",
    "isovectorial dibaryons were first observed @xcite ( and references therein ) , then other narrow dibaryon isospin states @xcite .",
    "narrow structures were also observed later in baryons @xcite and in mesons @xcite @xcite @xcite . since these structures were observed at stable masses , whatever the reaction , incident energy or production angle , they were associated with real hadrons and not with final state rescatterings .",
    "there is no room for new low mass mesons within the many quark models for mesons , that consider only @xmath6 configurations , given the excellent agreement between observation and calculations @xcite .",
    "once again there is no room in the mass range m@xmath71.5  gev for new baryons within the many quark models for baryons , if we consider only @xmath8 configurations .",
    "the classical baryonic spectrum , which corresponds to broad resonances , is rather well understood .",
    "this is not the case for the narrow structures observed .",
    "+ an interpretation was tentatively proposed to explain these narrow and exotic hadrons , associating them with two colored quark clusters .",
    "it was shown in the already quoted references that such an attempt allows to reproduce the masses with models using a very small number of adjusted parameters ( from zero to two ) , depending on the hadronic species in question . in these models , where the exotic hadron arises from a partial deconfinement",
    ", we would expect small narrow amplitude signatures throughout the complete hadronic spectra .",
    "this paper presents the analysis and the results obtained in order to check this idea in low mass baryons .",
    "preliminary results concerning the three first exotic baryons have previously been published @xcite . + this paper is constructed in the following way : in sec ii we will describe the detector performances , and the data processing ; in sec .",
    "iii the various normalizations applied in order to get the cross sections will be described ; the simulation used to make some of these normalizations and to test the complete experimental device will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv whereas the various checks performed in order to underline our confidence in the genuine reality of the observed structures are presented in section v. in section vi the results of our two experiments are presented , namely : + - the p  p @xmath0 p @xmath1 reaction , studied at three incident energies : t@xmath2=1.52 gev , 1.805 gev , and 2.1  gev and several forward angles .",
    "narrow baryons were looked for in the missing mass m@xmath3 and in the invariant mass m@xmath4 ; + - the missing mass of the @xmath9  p  @xmath10  p  p  x reaction was studied at two incident deuteron energies : t@xmath11=1.722 gev and 2.1  gev .",
    "+ we compare the masses of our structures to the masses of small structures which can be extracted from various reactions studied with incident hadrons or leptons by different collaborations .",
    "the observed masses will be discussed in section vii within a phenomenological model based on two quark cluster configurations . finally , the last part is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the measurements were performed at the saturne synchrotron beam facility .",
    "the proton beam energies were 1.52 gev , 1.805 gev and 2.1  gev , and the deuteron beam energies were 1.72 gev and 2.1  gev .",
    "the particles were detected using the spes3 spectrometer and detection system ( see fig .",
    "the main properties of the spectrometer were : + - a solid angle of @xmath12  50  mrad in both the horizontal and vertical planes , and + - a large momentum range ( 600 mev@xmath13pc@xmath131400  mev ) at b=3.07  t. + the liquid h@xmath14 target of 393  mg/@xmath15 was held in a container with 130  @xmath16 m thick ti windows .",
    "external heat shields comprised of 24  @xmath16 m thick aluminium were placed in the beam - line on either side of the target .",
    "the beam particles / burst varied between @xmath17/burst and 5x@xmath17/burst , depending on the spectrometer angle and the incident energy .",
    "it was chosen in such a way that the acquisition dead time was less than 10% .",
    "the vertical angular acceptance was determined using the spectrometer magnetic field map and geant code @xcite .",
    "the drift chambers , the trigger and the acquisition code were conceived in order to detect , to identify and to measure the properties of two - particle reactions .",
    "+ several drift chambers were used to reconstruct the particle trajectories .",
    "the first chamber c1 @xcite ( called `` mit - type '' ) , was situated on the spectrometer focal plane .",
    "its spatial and angular horizontal resolutions are  : @xmath18=90  @xmath16 m and @xmath19=18  mrad respectively . its efficiency was carefully calibrated using the other drift chambers .",
    "two multidrift chambers , c2-c3 ( called the `` cern - type '' chambers ) , placed perpendicular to the average particle direction , were designed to get information on trajectories in the horizontal and vertical planes .",
    "however , due to the small vertical magnification of the spectrometer ( @xmath20  0.14 ) , the @xmath21 resolution at the target was too poor to be useful .",
    "+ the trigger consisted of four planes of plastic scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "the first and last planes were each made of 20 scintillators each .",
    "the dimensions of each plastic detector were 12@xmath2240  @xmath23 for the first plane ( a ) , and 18@xmath2280  @xmath23 for the last plane ( b ) .",
    "the time of flight baseline from the first scintillator plane to the last one was 3  m. particles were identified by their time of flight between the a@xmath24 and b@xmath25 detectors and also by their energy loss in the a@xmath24 detectors .",
    "this latter measurement was mainly used to discriminate between one and two charged particles .",
    "mean - timers and constant fraction discriminators were used and the time resolution for each scintillator was typically @xmath26  =  180  ps .",
    "the large horizontal angular magnification of the spectrometer produced a large horizontal angular opening ( up to @xmath27 ) of the trajectories at the output of the spectrometer .",
    "this resulted in a large number of useful a@xmath24b@xmath25 combinations ( 125 ) , between the first and last scintillator planes , which required the same number ( 125 ) coincidences .",
    "it is important to note that a mean range of @xmath20  200  mev / c ( @xmath28 of the focal plane momentum dependant acceptance ) is seen by each a@xmath24b@xmath25 combination .",
    "therefore , there is a large overlap between many a@xmath24b@xmath25 trigger combinations for each spectrometer momentum .",
    "the count rate at each momentum value is then less liable to be influenced by errors from the scintillator efficiency .",
    "careful trigger efficiency measurements of all the 125 combinations were performed using a system of scintillator counters moving in front of the a - hodoscope and behind the b - hodoscope .",
    "the mean value of the trigger efficiency was @xmath29 .",
    "+ when the scattering angle or the incident energy vary , the mean value of the missing mass m@xmath3 moves for a given a@xmath24b@xmath25 coincidence .",
    "+      the mit drift chamber was located in the focal plane of the spectrometer .",
    "it therefore played a major role in our detection system , justifying a careful efficiency calibration .",
    "the efficiency of the mit drift chamber was evaluated using the cern drift chambers , by calculating the ratio of the number of times where all three detectors were hit to the number where only the two cern chambers were hit .",
    "figure 2 shows that this efficiency displays a slowly varying value as a function of position .",
    "consequently this efficiency correction can not be a source of eventual structures . in fig .",
    "2 the circles correspond to events where two particles were detected , and the triangles to single particle events .",
    "thanks to the large momentum bite of the spectrometer , the data were taken without having to move the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the regularly spaced structures seen in the results can not be attributed to an eventual mis - treatment of the mit drift chamber efficiency .",
    "+      in fig .  3 , four typical time of flight raw spectra , chosen among the 125 different possibilities , are shown .",
    "we observe the quality of the particle identification by looking at the two peak separation corresponding to pion and proton times of flight .",
    "the four inserts correspond to different spectrometer mean momenta and different angles .",
    "the inserts ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) correspond respectively to 1.36  gev / c ( top spectrometer momentum value ) , 1.25  gev / c , 1.00  gev / c , and 0.83  gev / c .",
    "the separation is always very good , even on the high momentum side . +",
    "a second level trigger filters the events that are stored .",
    "this was done thanks to a second time of flight between both detected particles which was used online in order to control the intensity dependent random hit rate .",
    "the same device was also used offline in order to reject the very small amount of misidentified particles between pions and protons at the top of the momentum range ( see fig .",
    "the time measured was corrected using the particle momenta , the corrections being calculated from the variable distances from the target to the first scintillating plastic hodoscope plane  a. after pedestal corrections and variable distance corrections , the time differences of all the @xmath30 time of flights ( 20@xmath22(20 - 1)/2=190 combinations ) were plotted on the same histogram and are shown in fig .",
    "we observe a tail due to accidental coincidences to the left of the peak .",
    "a window of @xmath12  9  channels , as drawn on the figure , was used in the detailed data analysis .",
    "incorrect proton - pion identifications fell around channel -21 , and can be seen as a small peak in the figure .",
    "these misidentified proton - pion events correspond to events that lie in the tail crossovers of the particle identification at the top end of the momentum scale ( see fig .",
    "the spectra of the first time of flight ( fig .",
    "3 ) were vetoed by the second time of flight .",
    "+      an important property of the experiment is the good mass resolution , essential when narrow and weakly excited structures are being looked for .",
    "the resolution in the invariant mass was measured using the final state interaction peak ( fsi ) from the p  p  @xmath10  p  p  x reaction .",
    "figure 5 shows these distributions for all three energies , vertically shifted in order to keep the figure easy to read . here ,",
    "full circles , squares , and triangles correspond respectively to results from t@xmath2=1.52  gev , 1.805  gev , and 2.1  gev incident energies .",

    "the resolution of the missing mass lowers for increasing angles .",
    "+ we clearly see three structures in fig . 6 , between the neutron peak and the @xmath35 bump .",
    "they are unexpected since there is no room for new low mass and narrow baryons within the many quark models @xcite .",
    "many checks were performed to ascertain the real presence of these new physical structures and they will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "several normalizations were performed in order to extract the cross sections and several corrections were applied which take into account accidental coincidences , lost events , angular vertical acceptances , and drift chamber and trigger efficiencies .",
    "the beam flux was calibrated with the help of two telescopes in direct view of the target and an ionisation chamber downstream of the beam .",
    "these three detectors were calibrated using @xmath36c activation measurements .",
    "the data must also be normalized to the two detected particle momenta ranges .",

    "this normalization was done for all cross sections presented .",
    "the momentum dependant acceptances were obtained from analytical relations or numerical fits to real or simulated data ( see later in section v.a ) .",
    "we have checked that the same final cross sections were obtained independently of the choice made for this normalization . the empty line in the figure",
    "will be discussed in the next paragraph .",

    "moreover , there is no reason for calculations , performed within the @xmath8 assumption , to explain the relatively narrow widths observed in our data .",
    "indeed , a calculation performed within a chiral quark model , investigated the hadronic @xmath59 and @xmath113 decay modes of n and @xmath35 resonances @xcite .",
    "the authors found various decay widths which were dependent on several calculation assumptions .",
    "however , for the only baryon that they considered in the mass range of the present study , the roper resonance n@xmath114 1/2 + , they calculated a width of the order of several hundreds of mev for the @xmath115(n@xmath116n@xmath59 ) decay mode .",
    "+ therefore , we tentatively associate our narrow baryons with exotic baryons made of two colored - quark clusters .",
    "the experimental masses agree well with the masses calculated within a phenomenological relation derived twenty years ago for two colored clusters in a spherical mit type bag .",
