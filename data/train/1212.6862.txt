    "this method , which we call the @xmath0-method , transfers an algebraic problem of finding explicit highest weight vectors to an analytic problem of solving differential equations ( of second order ) via the algebraic fourier transform of operators ( definition [ def : hat ] ) .",

    "in recent joint works with b.  rsted , m.  pevzner , p.  somberg and v.  souek @xcite , we have developed the @xmath0-method to more general settings , and have found new explicit formulas of equivariant differential operators in parabolic geometry , and also have obtained a generalization of the rankin ",
