    "many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks or graphs .",
    "the study of networks is crucial to understand both the structure and the function of these complex systems  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of complex networks is community structure , i.e. , the existence of groups of nodes such that nodes within a group are much more connected to each other than to the rest of the network .",
    "communities reflect the locality of the topological relationships between the elements of the target systems  @xcite , and may shed light on the relation between the structure and the function of complex networks .",
    "take the world wide web as an example , closely hyperlinked web pages form a community and they often talk about related topics  @xcite .",
    "the identification of community structure has attracted much attention from various scientific fields .",
    "many methods have been proposed and applied successfully to some specific complex networks  @xcite . in order to quantify the community structure of networks ,",
    "newman and girvan  @xcite proposed the modularity as a measure of a partition of network , in which each node only belongs to one community .",
    "the proposal of modularity has prompted the detection of community structure .",
    "however , the modularity faces several problems .",
    "for example , the modularity suffers a resolution limit problem  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the modularity - based methods can not tackle overlapping community structure , in which one node may belong to more than one community .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example network with overlapping community structure .",
    "intuitively , overlapping community structure can be represented by a cover of network .",
    "a cover of network is defined as a set of clusters such that each node is assigned to one or more clusters and no cluster is a proper subset of any other cluster . as to the network in figure  [ fig1 ] , the overlapping community structure can be represented by the cover @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3,@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "overlapping community structure has been widely studied  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the community structure is uncovered by @xmath6-clique percolation and the overlaps between communities are guaranteed by the fact that one node can participate in more than one clique .",
    "however , the @xmath6-clique method gives rise to an uncomplete cover of network , i.e. , some nodes may not belong to any community .",
    "in addition , the hierarchical structure can not be revealed for a given @xmath6 . in  @xcite , by introducing the concept of the belonging coefficients of each node to its communities , the authors proposed a general framework for extending the traditional modularity to quantify overlapping community structure .",
    "the method provides a new idea to find overlapping community structure .",
    "however , the physical meaning of the belonging coefficient lacks a clear explanation .",
    "furthermore , the framework is hard to extend to large scale networks since it is difficult to find an efficient algorithm to search the huge solution space .",
    "recently , evans et al  @xcite proposed a method to identify the overlapping community structure by partitioning a line graph constructed from the original network .",
    "this method only allows the communities to overlap at nodes .    in this paper , a measure for the quality of a cover is proposed to quantify the overlapping community structure referred as @xmath7 ( quality of a cover ) . with the measure @xmath7 , the overlapping community structure can be identified by finding an optimal cover , i.e. , the one with the maximum @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath7 is based on a maximal clique view of the original network .",
    "a maximal clique is a clique ( i.e. a complete subgraph ) which is not a subset of any other clique in a graph .",
    "the maximal clique view is according to a reasonable assumption that a maximal clique can not be shared by two communities due to that it is highly connective . to find an optimal cover ,",
    "we construct a maximal clique network from the original network .",
    "we then prove that the optimization of @xmath7 on the original network is equivalent to the optimization of the modularity on the maximal clique network .",
    "thus the overlapping community structure can be identified through partitioning the maximal clique network with an efficient modularity optimization algorithm , e.g. , the fast unfolding algorithm in  @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the measure @xmath7 is demonstrated by extensive tests on both the artificial networks and the real world networks with known community structure and the application to the word association network .",
    "in this section , we first propose a measure @xmath7 to quantify the overlapping community structure of networks .",
    "then the overlapping community structure of a network is identified by partitioning a maximal clique network constructed from the original network using a modularity optimization algorithm . finally , some discussions about our method are given .",
    "as mentioned above , the overlapping community structure can be represented as a cover of network instead of a partition of network .",
    "therefore , the overlapping community structure can be quantified through a measure of a cover of network .",
    "as well known , the modularity was used to measure the goodness of a partition of network . given an un - weighted , undirected network @xmath8 and a partition @xmath9 of the network @xmath10 , the modularity can be formalized as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the adjacency matrix of the network @xmath10 , @xmath13 is the total weight of all the edges , and @xmath14 is the degree of the vertex @xmath15 .    in equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath16 denotes whether the vertex @xmath15 belongs to the community @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is @xmath18 when the vertex @xmath15 belongs to the community @xmath17 and @xmath19 otherwise . for a cover of network ,",
    "however , a vertex may belong to more than one community .",
    "thus @xmath16 needs to be extended to a belonging coefficient @xmath20 , which reflects how much the vertex @xmath15 belongs to the community @xmath17 .    with the belonging coefficient @xmath20 ,",
    "the goodness of a cover @xmath21 can be measured by @xmath22    the idea of the belonging coefficient was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "its authors also pointed out that the belonging coefficient should satisfy a normalization property .",
    "this property is formally written as @xmath23 and @xmath24    equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) and equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) only give the general constraints on @xmath20 , which lead to such a huge solution space that the enumeration of all the solutions is impractical . to reduce the solution space and make the problem tractable",
    ", we introduce an additivity property for the belonging coefficient : the belonging coefficient of a vertex to a community @xmath17 is the sum of the belonging coefficients of the vertex to all of @xmath17 s sub - communities .    for example , we assume that @xmath25 @xmath26 is a cover of the network @xmath10 and @xmath27 is another cover of @xmath10 .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath21 is that the community @xmath29 is the union of the communities @xmath30 .",
    "the additivity property of belonging coefficient can then be formally denoted as @xmath31    the belonging coefficient @xmath20 reflects how much a vertex @xmath15 belongs to a community @xmath17 .",
    "intuitively , it is proportional to the total weight of the edges connecting the vertex @xmath15 to the vertices in the community @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the set of vertices belonging to community @xmath17 .",
    "note that the additivity property of belonging coefficient requires that communities are disjoint from a proper view of the network .",
    "therefore , we introduce the maximal clique view to achieve this purpose . we define @xmath20 as the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the number of maximal cliques containing the edge @xmath36 in the whole network , @xmath37 denotes the number of maximal cliques containing the edge @xmath36 in the community @xmath17 , and @xmath38 is a normalization term denoted as @xmath39    obviously , the definition in equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) satisfies the normalization property .",
    "it also satisfies the additivity property if we assume that each maximal clique only belongs to one community .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since a maximal clique is highly connective that any two communities sharing a maximal clique should be combined into a single one .    with equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) and equation  ( [ eq7 ] )",
    ", we obtain the detailed form of @xmath7 as a measure to the quality of a cover of network .",
    "note that when a cover degrades to a partition , @xmath7 becomes the modularity @xmath40 in  @xcite accordingly .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 when all vertices belong to the same community , and it will be shown later in section  [ sec3 ] that a high value of @xmath7 indicates a significant overlapping community structure .      with the measure @xmath7 , the overlapping community structure of network can be identified by finding the optimal cover with maximum @xmath7 . to find the optimal cover ,",
    "we construct a maximal clique network from the original network",
    ". then the overlapping community structure can be identified through partitioning the maximal clique network .",
    "given an un - weighted , undirected network  @xmath10 , a corresponding maximal clique network @xmath42 can be constructed through the following method .    the maximal clique network @xmath42 is constructed by defining its nodes and edges .",
    "we first find out all the maximal cliques in @xmath10 .",
    "we can simply take all these maximal cliques as nodes of @xmath42 . in practice , however , we observe that some maximal cliques would not be so highly connective if their sizes are too small .",
    "such a maximal clique either lies between different communities ( e.g. , the maximal cliques @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the network shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ) or connects a node to the whole network ( e.g. , the maximal clique @xmath45 in the network shown in figure  [ fig2](a ) ) . to deal with these small maximal cliques ,",
    "we introduce a threshold @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , given the parameter @xmath6 , we only refer to those maximal cliques with the size no smaller than @xmath6 as the maximal cliques , and refer to those with the size smaller than @xmath6 as subordinate maximal cliques .",
    "we then denote the vertices only belonging to subordinate maximal cliques as subordinate vertices . in this way , each maximal clique or subordinate vertex in the original network @xmath10 is taken as one node of @xmath42 .",
    "note that all the subordinate vertices and the maximal cliques form a cover @xmath21 of the original network @xmath10 . for a subordinate vertex @xmath15 and a cluster @xmath17 in the cover @xmath21 ,",
    "the value of @xmath20 is defined to be @xmath46 when @xmath15 belongs to the cluster @xmath17 and @xmath47 otherwise . as to other vertices",
    ", @xmath20 can be obtained according to equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "now we can define the edge of the maximal clique network @xmath42 by defining its adjacency matrix @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the set of the original network s vertices corresponding to the @xmath50-th node in @xmath42 .",
    "the element of @xmath48 is defined as @xmath51 and the strength ( degree ) of the @xmath50-th node @xmath52        for clarity , figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates the construction process of the maximal clique network from an example network with the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the subordinate vertices and the maximal cliques . each of them becomes a node in the resulting maximal clique network .",
    "for example , the maximal clique \\{1,2,4 } corresponds to the node @xmath54 and the subordinate vertex  \\{5 } corresponds to the node @xmath55 .",
    "each of these maximal cliques or subordinate vertices is a cluster in a cover @xmath21 of the original network .",
    "their belonging coefficients corresponding to the cover @xmath21 are shown in figure  [ fig2](c ) . according to these belonging coefficients and equation  ( [ eq9 ] )",
    ", the weight of each edge of the maximal clique network is obtained .",
    "take the edge connecting the nodes @xmath54 and @xmath56 as an example .",
    "as known , the node @xmath54 corresponds to the maximal clique \\{1,2,4 } and the node @xmath56 corresponds to the maximal clique \\{1,3,4}. using the equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) , the weight of this edge is  @xmath57@xmath58+@xmath59+@xmath60+@xmath61+@xmath62+@xmath63=@xmath64 + @xmath65+@xmath64+@xmath64+@xmath65+@xmath64=@xmath66 .",
    "the constructed maximal clique network is a weighted network though the original network is un - weighted .",
    "the total weight @xmath67 of all the edges in the maximal clique network is equal to the total weight ( number ) @xmath68 of edges in the original network .",
    "the proof is @xmath69    each vertex in the original network corresponds to more than one node in the maximal clique network .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig2 ] , the vertex @xmath18 corresponds to two nodes @xmath54 and @xmath56 in the maximal clique network .",
    "thus , a partition of the maximal clique network can be mapped to a cover of the original network , which holds the information about the overlapping community structure of the original network .",
    "now we investigate the overlapping community structure of the original network through partitioning its corresponding maximal clique network . to find the natural partition of a network ,",
    "the optimization of modularity is the widely used technique .",
    "the partition with the maximum modularity is regarded as the optimal partition of network .",
    "we employ the algorithm proposed in  @xcite to partition our maximal clique network . as an example , figure  [ fig3 ] shows the partition of a maximal clique network .",
    "different parts of the partition are differentiated by shapes or colors .    .",
    "the label near each node shows its corresponding vertices in the original network .",
    "the width of line indicates the weight of the corresponding edge .",
    "the self - loop edge of each node is omitted and its width is reflected by the volume of the associated circles , squares or triangles .",
    "in addition , the optimal partition of the maximal clique network is also depicted .",
    "the communities in this partition are differentiated by shapes .",
    "furthermore , the circle - coded community can be partitioned into two sub - communities .",
    "the four communities are shown in different colors , which are identical to the communities depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "here @xmath6 is @xmath70 .",
    ", width=264 ]    as mentioned above , each partition of the maximal clique network corresponds to a cover of the original network and the cover tells us the overlapping community structure .",
    "the key problem lies in that whether the optimal partition of the maximal clique network corresponds to the optimal cover of the original network . to answer this question , we analyze the relation between the modularity of the maximal clique network and the @xmath7 of the original network .",
    "let @xmath71 be a partition of the maximal clique network and @xmath72 be the corresponding cover of the original network . here",
    ", @xmath73 is the size of @xmath74 or @xmath75 , i.e. , the number of communities . using modularity ,",
    "the quality of the partition @xmath74 can be measured by @xmath76    using equations  ( [ eq9 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) , we have @xmath77    equation  ( [ eq13 ] ) tells us that the optimization of the @xmath7 on the original network is equivalent to the optimization of the modularity on the maximal clique network .",
    "thus we can find the optimal cover of the original network by finding the optimal partition of the corresponding maximal clique network .",
    "the optimal cover reflects the overlapping community structure of the original network .      as to our method",
    ", it is important to select an appropriate parameter @xmath6 .",
    "on one hand , the parameter @xmath6 affects the constituent of the overlapping regions between communities . according to the definition to subordinate vertices ,",
    "they are excluded from the overlapping regions .",
    "thus the larger the parameter @xmath6 , the less the number of vertices which can occur in the overlapping regions .",
    "when @xmath78 , the maximal clique network is identical to the original network and no overlap is identified . on the other hand , since the subordinate maximal cliques are not so highly connective , the parameter @xmath6 should not be too small in practice .",
    "the choice of the parameter @xmath6 depends on the specific networks .",
    "observed from many real world networks , the typical value of @xmath6 is often between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "additionally , as to the networks where larger cliques are rare , our method is close to the traditional modularity - based partition methods . in this case , rare overlaps will be found .",
    "both the traditional modularity and the @xmath7 are based on the significance of link density in communities compared to a null - model reference network , e.g. , the configuration model network .",
    "however , differently from the traditional modularity which requires that each node can only belong to one community , @xmath7 requires that each maximal clique can only belong to one community . in this way , @xmath7 takes advantage of both the local topological structure ( i.e. , the maximal clique ) and the global statistical significance of link density .    the same to the traditional modularity , however , the measure @xmath7 also suffers the resolution limit problem  @xcite , especially when applied to large scale complex networks .",
    "recently , some methods  @xcite have been proposed to address the resolution limit problem of modularity .",
    "these methods are also appropriate to the measure @xmath7 .",
    "now we turn to the efficiency of our method .",
    "it is difficult to give an analytical form of the computational complexity of our method .",
    "here we only discuss what influences the efficiency of our method .",
    "our method consists of three stages , finding out the maximal cliques , constructing the maximal clique network and partitioning the maximal clique network . as to the first stage , we need to find out all the maximal cliques in the network .",
    "it is widely believed to be a non - polynomial problem .",
    "however , for real world networks , finding all the maximal cliques is easy due to the sparseness of these networks .",
    "the computational complexity of the second stage depends on the number of edges in the original networks .",
    "finally , the partition stage rests with the number of the maximal cliques and subordinate vertices .",
    "taken together , our method is very efficient on real world networks .",
    "in addition , as mentioned above , the overlapping community structure can be identified by the optimization of @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , iteratively applying this method to each community , we can investigate the sub - communities correspondingly . in this way ,",
    "a rigid hierarchical relation of overlapping communities can be identified from the whole network .",
    "in this section , we extensively test our method on the artificial networks and the real world networks with known community structure .",
    "then we apply our method to a large real world complex network , which has been shown to possess overlapping community structure",
    ".       in the legend corresponds to the parameter @xmath6 in our method .",
    "the threshold @xmath81 ( dashed vertical line in the figure ) marks the border beyond which communities are no longer defined in the strong sense  @xcite , i.e. , such that each node has more neighbors in its own community than in the others .",
    "each point corresponds to an average over @xmath82 graph realization.,width=302 ]    to test our method , we utilize the benchmark proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it provides benchmark networks with heterogenous distributions of node degree and community size .",
    "in addition , it allows for the overlaps between communities .",
    "this benchmark poses a much more severe test to community detection algorithms than newman s standard benchmark  @xcite .",
    "there are many parameters to control the generated networks in this benchmark , the number of nodes @xmath83 , the average node degree @xmath84 , the maximum node degree @xmath85 , the mixing ratio @xmath86 , the exponent of the power - law node degree distribution @xmath87 , the exponent of the power - law distribution of community size @xmath88 , the minimum community size @xmath89 , the maximum community size @xmath90 , the number of overlapped nodes @xmath91 , and the number of memberships of each overlapped node @xmath92 . in our tests , we use the default parameter configuration where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . by tuning the parameter @xmath86 , we test the effectiveness of our method on the networks with different fuzziness of communities .",
    "the larger the parameter @xmath86 , the fuzzier the community structure of the generated networks is .    to evaluate the effectiveness of an algorithm for the identification of overlapping community structure , a measure is needed to compare the cover found by the algorithm with the ground truth . in  @xcite , a measure is proposed to compare two covers , which is an extension form of _ variation of information_. the more similar two covers are , the higher the value of the measure is . in this paper , we adopt it to compare the overlapping community structure found by our method and the known overlapping community structure in the benchmark networks .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the results of our method with @xmath102 on the benchmark networks .",
    "our method gives rather good results when the @xmath86 is smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "all of the values of the variation of information are above @xmath103 .",
    "note that in these cases , communities are defined in the strong sense  @xcite , i.e. , each node has more neighbors in its own community than in the others .",
    "we also test other settings of @xmath6 which are larger than @xmath80 , and find similar results .",
    "our first real world network for test is zachary s karate club network  @xcite , which is widely used as a benchmark for the methods of community identification .",
    "this network characterizes the social interactions between the individuals in a karate club at an american university .",
    "a dispute arose between the club s administrator and its principal karate teacher and as a result the club eventually split into two smaller clubs , centered around the administrator and the teacher respectively .",
    "the network and its fission is depicted in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the administrator and the teacher are represented by nodes @xmath18 and @xmath104 respectively .    .",
    ", width=264 ]        feeding this network into our method with the parameter @xmath105 , we obtain the result shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "similar to many existing community detection methods , our method partitions the network into four communities .",
    "this partition corresponds to the modularity with the value @xmath106 , while the real partition into two sub - networks has a modularity @xmath107 .",
    "actually , no vertex is misclassified by our method .",
    "the real split of the network can be obtained exactly by pair - wise merge of the four communities found by our method .",
    "we also note that no overlaps are found when @xmath105 .",

    "overlaps between communities emerge when the parameter @xmath6 is set to @xmath79 .",

    "similarly , the communities @xmath70 and @xmath109 are also closely related .",
    "however , the distance between the communities @xmath79 and @xmath109 is larger although they share as many as @xmath70 words .",
    "the overlaps between communities and the hierarchy of these communities provide us a more complete understanding to the relationship between communities .",
    "this paper focuses on the problem of quantifying and identifying the overlapping community structure of networks .",
    "there are two main contributions .",
    "firstly , a measure @xmath7 for the quality of a cover of network is proposed to quantify the overlapping community structure .",
    "the effectiveness of the measure @xmath7 is demonstrated by the experimental results that networks with significant overlapping community structure have a cover with a high @xmath7 .",
    "secondly , a maximal clique network is constructed from the original network , and then the overlapping community structure can be identified using any modularity optimization method on the maximal clique network .    the @xmath7 is an extension of traditional modularity with the consideration that the maximal clique instead of a single node can only belong to one community . in this way , @xmath7 takes advantage of both the local topological structure ( i.e. , the maximal clique ) and the global statistical significance of link density compared with a null - model reference network .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 can be naturally used to simultaneously identify the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of networks .",
    "such a method is helpful to more completely understand the functional and structural properties of networks .    as the further work",
    ", we will consider the generalization to the weighted and/or directed networks .",
    "it is also an interesting problem about the selection of the parameter @xmath6 in our method .",
    "we will further investigate how to determine an appropriate @xmath6 for a given network later .",
    "this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china under grant number @xmath153 , the national high - tech r&d program of china ( the @xmath154 program ) under grant number @xmath155 , and the national basic research program of china ( the @xmath156 program ) under grant number @xmath157 .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge s.  fortunato and a.  lancichinetti for providing the test benchmark and useful discussions on it .",
    "the authors thank mao - bin hu for helpful suggestions ."
