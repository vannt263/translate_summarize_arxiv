    "the study of axially symmetric solutions of einstein and einstein - maxwell field equations corresponding to disklike configurations of matter , apart from its purely mathematical interest , has a clear astrophysical relevance .",
    "indeed , thin disks can be used to model accretion disks , galaxies in thermodynamical equilibrium and the superposition of a black hole and a galaxy .",
    "disk sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields are also of astrophysical importance mainly in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "now , although normally it is considered that disks with electric fields do not have clear astrophysical importance , there exists the posibility that some galaxies be positively charged @xcite , so that the study of charged disks may be of interest not only in the context of exact solutions .",
    "accordingly , through the years , many attempts had been made to find exact solutions , static and stationary , to the einstein and einstein - maxwell equations that have as its source a relativistic thin disk .",
    "exact solutions having as sources relativistic static thin disks were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite and morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "since then several classes of exact solutions corresponding to static @xcite and stationary @xcite thin disks have been obtained by different authors and the superposition of a static or stationary thin disk with a black hole has been considered in @xcite .",
    "relativistic disks embedded in an expanding frw universe have been studied in @xcite , perfect fluid disks with halos in @xcite and the stability of thin disks models has been investigated using a first order perturbation of the energy - momentum tensor in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "thin disks have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite and conformastatic and conformastationary metrics @xcite , while models of electrovacuum static counterrotating dust disks were presented in @xcite .",
    "charged perfect fluid disks were also studied in @xcite , and charged perfect fluid disks as sources of static and taub - nut - type spacetimes in @xcite .",
    "now , between the above mentioned works , particularly interesting are those that consider dust disks in comformastatic spacetimes @xcite . in this case , the charge density of the disks is equal to their mass density and so the electric and gravitational forces are in exact balance .",
    "this kind of equilibrium configuration has been called by some authors ` electrically counterpoised dust ' ( ecd ) and has been studied with some detail , both in classical and relativistic theories @xcite . now",
    ", as the matter content of the source is dust , the corresponding energy - momentum tensor very probably will agree with all the energy conditions , a fact that is particularly relevant for models of relativistic thin disks .",
    "indeed , as can be see in some of the above mentioned works , there are many models of relativistic thin disk that do not agree with these conditions , and also many models that only fulfill these conditions partially .",
    "the conformastatic thin disks presented at references @xcite were obtained by means of the well known ` displace , cut and reflect ' method in order to introduce a discontinuity at the first derivative of one otherwise smooth solution .",
    "the result is a solution with a singularity of the delta function type in all the @xmath0 hypersurface and so can be interpreted as an infinite thin disk . on the other hand , solutions that can be interpreted as thin disks of finite extension can be obtained if a proper coordinate system is introduced . a coordinate system that it adapts naturally to a finite source and it presents the required discontinuous behavior",
    "is given by the oblate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "some examples of finite thin disks solutions expressed in these coordinates can be found at references @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an infinite family of axially symmetric charged dust disks of finite extension . in order to obtain the thin disk solutions",
    ", we will solve the einstein - maxwell equations for conformastatic spacetimes assuming that the metric function and the electric potential are functionally related and that the metric function is functionally dependent of another auxiliary function , which is taken as a solution of laplace equation .",
    "then we take the solutions for the auxiliary potential as given by the infinite family of generalized kalnajs disks recently obtained by gonzlez and reina @xcite , which is expressed in terms of the oblate spheroidal coordinates and represents a well behaved family of finite axisymmetric flat galaxy models .    accordingly , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec . [ sec : ecs ] , we present the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations system and their solution for conformastatic spacetimes . we introduce the assumed functional dependences in order to explicitly integrate the equations system in such a way that the metric function and the electric potential can be expressed in terms of solutions of laplace equation .",
    "the oblate spheroidal coordinates are introduced and the general solution of the laplace equation expressed in these coordinates is presented .    next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : emt ] , we obtain the surface energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density of the relativistic thin disks .",
    "so , we first present a summary of the procedure to obtain the energy - momentum tensor and the current density by using the distributional approach for the case of conformastatic spacetimes .",
    "the relation between the energy density and the charge density is explicitly derived and the energy density is written in terms of the mass density of the newtonian thin disks , in such a way that is explicitly shown that the relativistic thin disks will be in agreement with all the energy conditions .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : kal ] , we restrict the general model by considering a particular family of well behaved charged dust disks .",
    "we present the particular form of the solutions of laplace equation that describe finite newtonian thin disk with a well behaved surface mass density , and we use this solution to obtain the corresponding relativistic charged dust disks .",
    "the behavior of the energy density is then graphically analyzed and their main properties are described . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we present a brief discussion of our main results .",
    "the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations , in geometrized units such that @xmath1 , can be written as @xmath2 with the electromagnetic energy - mementum tensor given by @xmath3 , \\label{eq : emtensor}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath5 is the electromagnetic four potential .",
    "now then , for a conformastatic spacetime the line element can be written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 as @xcite @xmath7 where the metric function @xmath8 do not depends on @xmath9 .",
    "so , if we take the electromagnetic potential as @xmath10 where it is assumed that the electric potential @xmath11 also is independent of @xmath9 , the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations reduce to @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the usual differential operator in cylindrical coordinates .    in order to solve the above equations system , first it is assumed that the electric potential @xmath11 is functionally dependent of the metric function @xmath8 , @xmath15 , so that equation ( [ eq : eme1 ] ) implies that @xmath16^{2}=e^{2\\lambda},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose solution is given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "with this solution , the equations system ( [ eq : eme2])-([eq : eme3 ] ) reduces to only one non - linear partial differential equation , @xmath19 for the metric function @xmath8 .",
    "then , we assume an additional functional dependence for the metric function @xmath8 , which it is expressed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an auxiliary function that is taken as a solution of laplace equation .",
    "thus then , equation ( [ eq : eclam ] ) it reduces to @xmath22^{2 } , \\label{12}\\ ] ] whose solution is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "now , in order to have an appropriated behavior at infinity , we will impose some boundary conditions on the solutions .",
    "so , in order to have an assymptotically flat spacetime , we must have that @xmath26 at infinite .",
    "also we require that @xmath27 at infinity , since we are only considering sources of finite extension .",
    "accordingly , we shall consider for the function @xmath21 only those solutions of laplace equation that behave as @xmath28 at infinite , in such a way that by taking @xmath29 we obtain the desired behavior for @xmath8 .",
    "finally , in order to fulfill the required behavior for @xmath11 , we must take @xmath30 and so equation ( [ eq : philam ] ) can be cast as @xmath31 , \\label{eq : phiu}\\ ] ] where the constants have been renamed as @xmath32 .    as we can see from ( [ lambdau ] ) and ( [ eq : phiu ] ) , the solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations system ( [ eq : eme2])-([eq : eme3 ] )",
    "are expressed in terms of @xmath21 , a solution of the laplace equation .",
    "so , in order to have solutions that correspond to finite thin disks we must to use solutions of laplace equation that properly describe newtonian disklike sources of finite radius .",
    "this kind of solutions can be obtained by introducing the oblate spheroidal coordinates , which adapt in a natural way to the geometry of these sources .",
    "this coordinates are related with the cylindrical coordinates by the relation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so , the disk has coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath37 and , on crossing the disk , @xmath38 changes sign but does not change in absolute value .",
    "now then , the singular behavior of the coordinate @xmath38 implies that a polynomial in even powers of @xmath38 is a continuous function everywhere but has a discontinuous @xmath38-derivative at the disk .",
    "accordingly , the general solution of laplace equation corresponding to an axially symmetric thin disklike source of radius @xmath39 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath40 where the @xmath41 are the legendre polynomials of order @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the legendre function of second kind of imaginary argument .",
    "the @xmath45 are constants that must be specified in order to have any particular solution and are directly related with the surface mass density of the newtonian source considered .",
    "so , in a next section , we will present a particular choice of these constants corresponding to an infinite family of finite thin disks with a well behaved surface mass density , the family of kalnajs generalized disks recently presented by gonzlez and reina @xcite .",
    "as was pointed in the precedent section , the solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations corresponding to a finite disklike source are even functions of the @xmath46 coordinate .",
    "so then , they are everywhere continuous functions but with their first @xmath46-derivatives discontinuous at the disk surface . accordingly , in order to obtain the energy - momentun tensor and the current density of the source , we will express the jump across the disk of the first @xmath46-derivatives of the metric tensor as @xmath47 = 2 { g_{ab , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\ ] ] and the jump across the disk of the electromagnetic field tensor as @xmath48 = [ a_{a , z } ] = 2 { a_{a , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\ ] ] where the reflection symmetry of the functions with respect to @xmath0 has been used .",
    "then , by using the distributional approach @xcite , the einstein - maxwell equations yield an energy - momentum tensor as @xmath49 + q^{ab } \\delta(z ) , \\label{eq : emtot}\\ ] ] and a current density as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the heaveside and dirac distributions with support on @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath53 are the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensors as defined by ( [ eq : emtensor ] ) for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 regions , respectively , whereas that @xmath56 gives the part of the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the disk source , and @xmath57\\ ] ] is the contribution of the disk source to the current density .",
    "now , the `` true '' surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk , @xmath58 , and the `` true '' surface current density , @xmath59 , can be obtained through the relationships @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the physical measurement of length in the direction normal to the disk .    for the metric ( [ eq : metcc ] ) , the only non - zero component of @xmath62 is @xmath63 whereas that the only non - zero component of @xmath64 is @xmath65 thus , the only non - zero component of surface energy - momentum tensor @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 and the only non - zero component of the surface current density @xmath59 is @xmath68 where all the quantities are evaluated at @xmath69 .",
    "the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk and the surface current density of the disk then can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the velocity vector of the matter distribution .",
    "so then , the energy density and the charge density of the distribution of matter are given by @xmath72 respectively .",
    "now , by using equation ( [ eq : philam ] ) , the expression ( [ eq : sigma ] ) can be written as @xmath73 so that the charge density of the disks is equal , except maybe by a sign , to their mass density .",
    "accordingly , the electric and gravitational forces are in exact balance , as in the configurations of ecd that were mentioned at the introduction .",
    "now then , in the context of classical general relativity , it is assumed that the energy - momentum tensor must fulfill certain requirements , which are embodied in the _ weak , strong and dominat energy conditions _ @xcite . indeed ,",
    "for the case of a dust source , all these conditions it reduce to the condition that the energy density be greater or equal to zero , @xmath74 . on the other hand , from equation ( [ lambdau ] )",
    ", we have that the energy density can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the newtonian mass density of a disklike source which gravitational potential is given by @xmath21 . accordingly",
    ", if the newtonian mass density @xmath77 is everywhere no negative , the corresponding relativistic energy density @xmath78 will be no negative everywhere only if we take @xmath79 .",
    "so then , in order that the energy - momentum tensor of the disks will agree with all the energy conditions , the @xmath45 constants in ( [ eq : gensol ] ) must be properly chosen in such a way that @xmath80 . furthermore ,",
    "if we have a newtonian potential @xmath21 that it is negative everywhere , as is expected for a compact newtonian source , then the energy density @xmath78 will be non - singular everywhere at the disk .",
    "now we shall restrict the previous general model by considering a particular family of disks with a well - behaved surface energy density .",
    "the members of the family are expressed in terms of particular solutions @xmath81 of the laplace equation obtained by choosing properly the constants of the general solution ( [ eq : gensol ] ) .",
    "the obtained particular solutions @xmath81 represent the newtonian gravitational potential of finite thin disks with mass density given by @xmath82^{m - \\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the total mass and the radius of the disk and we must take @xmath84 . for each value of @xmath85 , the constants @xmath45 are defined through the relation @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87\\ ] ] for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 . in table [ tab : c2n ] we list the values of the nonzero @xmath45 for the first six members of the family .",
    "so , by using this constants in the general solution ( [ eq : gensol ] ) is easy to see that the gravitational potential @xmath81 will be negative everywhere , as was imposed at the previous section .",
    ".[tab : c2n]the @xmath45 constants for @xmath91 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the above values for the @xmath45 , we can easily compute the corresponding energy density of the disks by using equation ( [ eq : epsig ] ) .",
    "now , in order to graphically illustrate the behavior of the different particular models , first we introduce dimensionless quantities through the relations @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is evaluated at @xmath69 .",
    "accordingly , the dimesionless energy density @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 ^ 2},\\ ] ] with @xmath98 .    then , by using the above expressions and the values of the @xmath45 constants given at table [ tab : c2n ] , we obtain the following expressions    @xmath99 ^ 2 } , \\\\      & &   \\nonumber    \\\\ { \\tilde \\epsilon}_2 & = & - \\frac{5 { \\tilde k } ( 1 - { \\tilde r}^2)^{3/2}}{2 [ { \\tilde k } - \\frac{15 \\pi}{128 } ( 3 { \\tilde r}^4 - 8 { \\tilde r}^2 + 8)]^2 } , \\\\      & &   \\nonumber    \\\\ { \\tilde \\epsilon}_3 & = & - \\frac{7 { \\tilde k } ( 1 - { \\tilde r}^2)^{5/2}}{2 [ { \\tilde k } + \\frac{35 \\pi}{512 } ( 5 { \\tilde r}^6 - 18 { \\tilde r}^4 + 24 { \\tilde r}^2 - 16)]^2 } , \\\\      & &   \\nonumber    \\\\ { \\tilde \\epsilon}_4 & = & - \\frac{9 { \\tilde k } ( 1 - { \\tilde r}^2)^{7/2}}{2 [ { \\tilde k } - \\frac{315 \\pi}{32768 } ( 35 { \\tilde r}^8 - 160 { \\tilde r}^6 + 288 { \\tilde r}^4 - 256 { \\tilde r}^2 + 128)]^2 } , \\\\      & &   \\nonumber    \\\\ { \\tilde \\epsilon}_5 & = & - \\frac{11 { \\tilde k } ( 1 - { \\tilde r}^2)^{9/2}}{2 [ { \\tilde k } + \\frac{693 \\pi}{131072 } ( 63 { \\tilde r}^{10 } - 350 { \\tilde r}^8 + 800 { \\tilde r}^6 - 960 { \\tilde r}^4 + 640 { \\tilde r}^2 - 256)]^2 } , \\\\      & &   \\nonumber    \\\\ { \\tilde \\epsilon}_6 & = & - \\frac{13 { \\tilde k } ( 1 - { \\tilde r}^2)^{11/2}}{2 [ { \\tilde k } - \\frac{3003 \\pi}{2097152 } ( 231 { \\tilde r}^{12 } - 1512 { \\tilde r}^{10 } + 4200 { \\tilde r}^8 - 6400 { \\tilde r}^6 + 5760 { \\tilde r}^4 - 3072 { \\tilde r}^2 + 1024)]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the energy densities of the first six disk models .    @xmath100    we plot , in figure [ figure1 ] , the dimensionless surface energy density @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 for the first six disk models with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in each case , we plot @xmath109 for @xmath94 with different values of the parameter @xmath110 .",
    "we first take @xmath111 , the bottom curve in each plot , and then @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "as we can see , in all the cases the energy density is everywhere positive and vanishes at the edge of the disk .",
    "however , there are different behaviors depending of the values of @xmath85 and @xmath110 .",
    "so , for the first two models , for @xmath103 and @xmath117 , we find that for small values of @xmath118 the energy density presents a maximum near the edge of the disk , whereas that for higher values of @xmath118 the maximum occurs at the center of the disk . on the other hand , for @xmath119",
    ", we find that for all the values of @xmath118 the maximum of the energy density occurs at the center of the disk .",
    "we can also see that as the value of @xmath85 increases , the energy density is more concentrated at the center of the disks .",
    "also , in the central part of the disks , as @xmath85 increases the value of the energy density also increases in such a way that , for a given value of @xmath110 , the energy density is grater for a greater value of @xmath85 . on the other hand , at the border of the disks the behavior is opposite , the value of the energy density decreases as @xmath85 increases . in order to see this , we plot in figure [ figure2 ] the dimensionless energy density @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 with @xmath120 for the disk models with @xmath103 , ... , @xmath108 .",
    "finally , for a given value of @xmath85 , the value of the energy density initially increases with the value of @xmath118 , but then it reaches a maximum and then it decreases as @xmath121 increases .",
    "we depict this behavior at figure [ figure3 ] where we plot the dimensionless energy density at the center of the disks , @xmath122 , as a fuction of @xmath110 for the same six disk models previously considered .",
    "now then , as the charge density of the disks is equal , up tu a sign , to their energy density , all the previous analysis apply as well to the behavior of the surface charge density of the models",

    "a functional dependence was assumed between the electric potential and the metric function and beteween this one and an auxiliary function .",
    "the solutions were then expressed in terms of a solution of laplace equation corresponding to a family of newtonian thin disks of finite radius , the generalized kalnajs disks @xcite , which describes a well behaved family of flat galaxy models .",
    "the relativistic thin disks here presented have a charge density that is equal , up to a sign , to their energy density , and so they are examples of the commonly named ` electrically counterpoised dust ' equilibrium configuration .",

    "[ sec : ecs ] , the procedure here presented can be applied not only for axisymmetric conformastatic spacetimes but can also be used to obtain non - axisymmetric solutions of the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations .",

    "so , we are now working in this direction and the results will be presented in a next paper .",
