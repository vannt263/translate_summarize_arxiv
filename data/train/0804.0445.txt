    "the observational results can be divided in two parts : point - like 1720mhz ( maser ) emission and extended 1720mhz absorption , presented in turn below .      to unambiguously exclude noise spikes as false maser detections , we consider a maser to be detected only if it has a channel flux density larger than 10 times the 1@xmath19 rms noise level in its data set . with this strict constraint ,",
    "we detect 13 new and 13 previously published masers in the 2005 data .",
    "one of the newly discovered masers was also detected in the 1998 data ( maser # 1 in table  [ masers ] at 11@xmath19 ) but no other new masers were found above 10@xmath19 in the archival vla data . apart from the general possibility of intrinsic variability ( which exists : sect .",
    "[ cndmasers ] ) , this is most likely due to the much larger channel widths ( 8.5 ^-1 kms@xmath1 ) or the much larger rms noise in the archival data sets . for example , assuming no variability , the brightest new single - channel detection ( maser # 24 at 25@xmath19 ) would be smeared to less than 7@xmath19 rms in a 8.5 ^-1 kms@xmath1channel in the 1986 june data set and thus would remain undetected using our strict 10@xmath19 constraint . actually , knowing the positions and velocities of the newly detected masers , we found most of the masers # 2028 at about 4@xmath196@xmath19 levels back in both the 1986 and 1998 data ; the 1996 data was too noisy",

    "table  [ masers ] lists the oh name in galactic coordinates , the position of the maser , the total width in ^-1 kms@xmath1  of the channels in which emission occurs , the velocity of the channel containing the peak flux , the total detected flux integrated over the velocity width , and finally references to the papers where previous detections are reported . for the masers detected multiple times , we have adopted the parameters derived from the most recent 2005 dataset , or from k03 if the maser was confused or undetected in 2005 ( for confusion see * ? ? ?",
    "small positional offsets compared to earlier papers are due to differences in the self - calibration .",
    "velocity offsets and flux differences are due to different observing parameters per data set and possible intrinsic variability of the maser . because the maser emission is generally found only in 1 - 2 channels and may be non - gaussian and narrower than the channel separation , spectral fitting to the feature to obtain a fitted flux , center velocity , fwhm and their associated errors is meaningless .",
    "we therefore assume an uncertainty in the center velocity and velocity range of half the channel separation ( i.e. , 1 ^-1 kms@xmath1  except for the ones adopted from k03 where it is about 4 ^-1 kms@xmath1 ) , and up to 50% uncertainty in the flux .",

    "yz01 suggest that the h@xmath11 filaments could be generated by the impact of sgraeast into the backside of the cnd . as a note of caution ,",

    "[ ellipse ] ( lower right panel ) , we favor alternative _ b ) _ where these northwestern snr masers are generated in the molecular cloud material at the front ( near ) side of the snr . we can not determine whether the shock does , or does not penetrate the cnd from the back .",

    "this is precisely where the bright 1720mhz masers form .",
    "in contrast to the northwestern masers , the nicmos image only shows weak extended h@xmath11 emission , no filaments ( fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] ; yz01 ) .",
    "moreover , this region displays almost no continuum background and oh absorption ( fig .  [ absorption ] ; fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] ; k03 ) .",
    "this region likely is a result of two colliding shock fronts and would explain why there is such a sharp line of bright masers .",
    "previous discussions of these masers suggested that they are the result of the interaction of the @xmath050 ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud and sgraeast .",
    "we here suggest that they probably are due to a snr / snr interaction ( albeit close to the front - side snr / ism interaction in fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] ) , for which 1720mhz maser emission has not been anticipated before .",
    "we here discuss the masers near the tangent points of the cnd with high absolute ( @xmath37104141 ^-1 kms@xmath1 ) velocities ( circles in fig .",
    "[ maserpos ] ) .",
    "a bright maser at @xmath0132 ^-1 kms@xmath1  has been detected in all observations ( i.e. , since 1986 and beyond 2005 ) in the northern part of the disk ( yz96 ; k03 ; this work ) .",

    "kms@xmath1  maser was detected in the southern part of the cnd ( k03 and references therein ) which disappeared before the next possible detection in 1996 .",
    "up until now , this single detection has been the only observation suggesting that some 1720mhz masers are distributed symmetrically in position and velocity with respect to sgra * , like the cnd , in sharp contrast to the snr / ism interaction at velocities between 30 and 70 ^-1 kms@xmath1  as discussed above .",
    "the three new detections of high - negative velocity 1720mhz masers toward the southwestern part of the cnd ( table  [ masers ] ) now strongly support the existence of conjugate masers with locations and velocities consistent with originating from gas in the cnd . clearly these masers are variable as they may appear and/or disappear on time scales on the order of years ( sect .",
    "[ resmas ] ) .",
    "the estimated oh column density derived above appears similar across the total extent of the cnd , indicating that maser emission potentially could be observed at all azimuthal angles of the cnd .",
    "this in particular would be the case if sgraeast would continuously drive planar shocks from behind into the cnd while the cnd is pushed toward the observer as argued by yz01 and @xcite data do not properly cover the cnd . ] .",
    "in such a case , one would expect to find some masers originating in the @xmath020 ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud , i.e. , with velocities in the @xmath22 1050 ^-1 kms@xmath1range , in projection _ toward the whole cnd_. though there are three masers in this velocity range north of the cnd ( and associated with h@xmath11 filaments ) , there is no distribution toward the rest of the cnd .",
    "furthermore , a push from behind would result in a relatively constant pumping of the masers , which due to the clear variability of the southwestern ( high - negative velocity ) cnd masers is hard to support .",
    "in contrast , the oh masers in the cnd appear only in two regions : slightly east of north and west of south at positions close to the geometrical tangent points .",
    "extended h@xmath11 emission is found nearby those regions , but not distributed in filaments as for the northwestern masers ( sect .",
    "[ snrnw ] ) .",
    "this h@xmath11 emission is due to both limb brightening effects as well as dissipation of shocks in clump - clump interactions ( yz01 ) . for the case of masers in a disk or ring structure",
    ", this geometry can be understood by the requirement of having long paths of velocity coherent gas in order to build up a large amplification .",
    "closer to the tangent points of a disk , the path - lengths are longer resulting in a larger amplification @xcite .",
    "such a behavior has previously been observed in maser transitions of h@xmath11o and oh in extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the cnd masers can be sustained without being a direct result from shocks generated by sgraeast ( sect .",
    "[ pump ] ) .      whereas the pumping of the snr masers can be explained by the interaction of the snr shock",
    "plowing into the interstellar material of the @xmath050 ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud , it is not required that the snr and the cnd directly interact to form the cnd masers .    a radiative ( far - infrared ) pump source primarily tends to invert the 1612mhz line , while collisional excitation has been identified as the prime pumping mechanism for 1720mhz oh masers @xcite .",
    "the lack of interstellar oh 1612mhz and mainline emission in the cnd ( k03 ) argues against far - infrared pumping and for a collisional pumping scheme of the 1720mhz cnd masers . in the cnd",
    "we find extended shock excited h@xmath11 emission in the `` lobes '' ( yz01 ) , but not in large - scale shock - front filamentary structure as for the northwestern masers .",
    "the clumpiness and irregular distribution of molecular gas in the cnd imply the possibility of frequent clump - clump collisions which could provide the source of a collisional maser pump .",
    "the dense ( @xmath44 34@xmath510@xmath45  @xmath25 ) molecular clumps defined by hcn and hco@xmath46 observations are found more or less in the same locations where bright h@xmath11 emission has been mapped ( @xcite ; yz01 ) .",
    "yz01 use the h@xmath11 line emission associated with the cnd to argue that dissipation of the random motions of molecular clumps is the most likely cause of the excitation of the h@xmath11 molecules via shocks , implying the presence of c - type shocks within the cnd .",
    "similar to the c - shock chemistry predicted for snr / ism masers , the post - shock regions in the cnd should produce suitable conditions for regions of enhanced oh abundances @xcite .    comparing the maser positions with respect to the h@xmath11 ( yz01 ) and hcn emission @xcite and assuming that the cnd masers are excited via shocks , it is not surprising to see a correlation between the maser emission and the h@xmath11 emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that the masers always appear to be offset from , and trailing the brightest hcn and h@xmath11 peaks . at the high densities ( @xmath47  @xmath25 ) traced by hcn",
    ", maser emission will be quenched .",
    "instead , the masers occur in lower density post - shock regions following / trailing the clumps .",
    "the large dispersion ( @xmath22 40 ^-1 kms@xmath1 ) in the southwestern cnd masers may reflect the dispersion of individual clumps in the cnd .",
    "a clumpy medium also appears to be a better maser amplifier than a smooth medium .",
    "extragalactic oh masers have successfully been modeled assuming a clumpy medium @xcite .",
    "modeling of masers in a clumpy medium predicts high maser variability caused by smaller regions of inverted gas moving in and out of the line - of - sight .",
    "however , no clear limits could be set on the variability of individual maser features presented in this paper as each observation so far has very different observing parameters ( table  [ datasets ] ) .",
    "a forthcoming paper will properly address the maser variability using homogeneous data sets .",
    "the velocities and locations of most 1720mhz oh masers observed in the gc agree with the commonly adopted model in which the masers arise in regions where the supernova remnant sgraeast is interacting with the @xmath020 and @xmath050 ^-1 kms@xmath1  molecular clouds and the nearby snr g359.02@xmath20.09 .",
    "in addition to extending the database of such masers , in particular toward the interaction region toward the northeast rim of sgraeast , we have explored the slightly different possible origins of the maser groups , notably the masers northwest of the cnd .",
    "we showed that they indicate a region of shock interaction of the near side of sgraeast with molecular cloud material extending well over the projected size of the cnd .",
    "the newly found masers in the northeast indicate such an interaction on the far side of sgraeast .    furthermore , we have verified the existence of high - negative velocity masers , which together with previously detected high - positive velocity masers bracket sgra * both in position and velocity .",
    "their positions and velocities are consistent with being located near the tangent points of the cnd .",
    "however , we find no need for the snr to interact directly with the cnd to pump and sustain these high - velocity masers .",
    "oh absorption data show that the cnd and sgraeast are separated by molecular cloud material , and therefore the snr shock is unlikely to be responsible for pumping these high - velocity masers .",
    "instead a more likely pumping mechanism is by collisions from dissipation between clumps _ in _ the cnd .",
    "these results imply that 1720mhz oh masers _ not only _ do occur in sfrs and in snr / ism ( and snr / snr ) interactions , but can also arise in clumpy and disturbed circumnuclear disks at small radii .",
    "if sufficiently bright , such 1720mhz masers could serve as an additional molecular line tool to study circumnuclear gas dynamics around galaxy centers .",
