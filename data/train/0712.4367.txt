    "<S> the analysis of the deuteron production in p  be interactions at 450 gev / c taken by the na56/spy experiment at cern sps is presented . in the framework of the coalescence model , the coalescence factor @xmath0 is determined as @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> systematics are due to particle dependence of the transmission along the h6 beamline ( @xmath14 ) , uncertainties in the subtraction of @xmath15 decaying outside the target ( conservatively a @xmath16 error was assumed on the value of the correction goes from @xmath17 at 7 gev / c to @xmath18 at 40 gev / c . ] ) and empty target corrections .    </S>",
