    "another attempt at a general local framework can be found in @xcite . in all these approaches ,",

    "schwartz space_. for the godement  jacquet case @xmath0 is a vector space , so the evident candidate is the usual schwartz  bruhat space . the general case is much more delicate , and this is related to the singularity of @xmath0 ; see @xcite for the unramified geometric aspect .",
    "thus a natural approach is to look at the case of smooth @xmath0 first .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 is an algebraic , finite - dimensional representation of @xmath1 .",
    "if there is an open dense @xmath1-orbit @xmath3 in @xmath0 , we say the triplet @xmath15 is a _ prehomogeneous vector space_. these objects have been studied in depth by m. sato and his school .",

    "we have to modify @xmath37 and @xmath17 to be @xmath38-valued , where @xmath38 is the @xmath1-equivariant line bundle of half - densities .",

    "we regard prehomogeneous vector spaces mainly as a testing ground .",
