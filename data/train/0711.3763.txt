    "as it is well known , the gauge / string theory correspondence relates strongly coupled gauge- with weakly coupled string theories and vice versa @xcite .",
    "further developments in the field lead to studies of the non - perturbative quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite or as relevant to the physics of the early universe and super dense stars . among the items that were studied using a gravity dual are the plasma s shear viscosity @xcite , photoproduction @xcite , jet - quenching @xcite , and drag force @xcite .",
    "a large portion of the research conducted in this area centers on @xmath1 super yang - mills and ads / cft in its best understood form , d3-branes in type iib theory .",
    "apart from the fact that this is the most tractable of gravity duals , one reason for choosing @xmath1 is that albeit having properties very different from those of qcd at @xmath2 , the two theories start to appear more and more similiar as soon as there is finite temperature . despite these successes",
    "however a complete study of qgp physics based on string theory demands for an investigation of the @xmath3 behavior of other gravity duals showing a stronger resemblance to qcd even at zero temperature .",
    "some work in this direction was undertaken in @xcite    in this paper we investigate the possibility of constructing a supergravity background dual to an @xmath4 qgp based on d6-branes wrapping an @xmath5 in the deformed conifold . in order for some supersymmetry to be preserved , the field theory living on the world - volume of the branes has to be topologically twisted @xcite .",
    "apart from the usual gauge / gravity correspondence , the theory exhibits a further large @xmath6 duality , the conifold transition , whose history starts with @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that topological string theory on a blown up calabi - yau conifold is equivalent to chern - simmons gauge theory on @xmath5 at large @xmath6 .",
    "this duality reappears in the context of the ads / cft correspondence when considering @xmath6 d6-branes wrapping an @xmath5 in the deformed conifold @xcite , as the conifold transition connects this setup to type iia string theory on the resolved conifold without any branes but with @xmath6 units of ramond - ramond flux through an @xmath7 . independently of whether one starts from the resolved or the deformed conifold ,",
    "when lifting to m - theory the geometry is that of the spin bundle over @xmath5 , a manifold with @xmath0 holonomy @xcite , and the duality takes the form of the flop transition @xcite .",
    "the connection to 8-dimensional gauged supergravity was established in @xcite .",
    "the duality resurfaces in the gauge - theory as follows . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the gauge - theory is best described by the @xmath6 d6-branes wrapping the @xmath5 . for large t hooft coupling",
    "however , one needs to consider the branes gravitational backreaction and makes therefore use of the resolved conifold .",
    "the theory is pure @xmath4 super yang - mills with additional massive degrees of freedom from kaluza - klein reduction .",
    "we will see it is not possible to fully decouple these modes .",
    "also , as was already shown in @xcite for the case of flat d6-branes , one can not expect the gauge theory to fully decouple from gravity .    if one wants to use this gravity dual to study the qgp , one needs to add a black hole to the supergravity background . as the theory is purely gravitational",
    "when lifting to eleven dimensions , the equations of motion take the simplest form possible here , @xmath9 making this the best place to perform the search for a black hole solution . as we find in section [ sec : finitetempsugra ] , if one wants to keep the ansatz for the new metric as simple as possible by making the substitutions @xmath10 there is a non - trivial solution if and only if one makes the geometry of the @xmath0 manifold singular .",
    "the unique solution is then @xmath11 , where the singularity at @xmath12 is hidden by the horizon @xmath13 .",
    "when studying the thermodynamics of this new solution , we will see that the black hole behaves in many ways as the ordinary schwarzschild solutions in four and eleven dimensions .",
    "i.e.  the temperature is proportional to the inverse of the horizon , @xmath14 , and the specific heat is negative .",
    "as the horizon of the black hole covers the six - dimensional base of the internal @xmath0 cone , the entropy behaves as @xmath15 , leading to the surprising relation @xmath16 .",
    "while our subsequent calculation of the quark - antiquark potential and the shear - viscosity show the expected results , that is confinement and a shear - viscosity to entropy ratio of @xmath17 , the discussion of parton energy loss leads to a puzzling pathological property of the solution .",
    "the energy loss as calculated from the jet - quenching parameter and the damping coefficient of the drag force are both vanishing .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections [ sec : zerotempsugra ] and [ sec : zerotempgt ] are dedicated to an extensive review of the string theory and its gauge dual at zero temperature . here",
    "our discussion starts with eleven - dimensional supergravity and then proceeds via type iia to the four - dimensional super yang - mills theory .",
    "as we will make extensive use of the machinery of wilson lines , we shall give a brief introduction to this subject before calculating the quark - antiquark potential , paying special attention to the boundary conditions imposed on worldsheets used to calculate wilson lines .",
    "after these preliminaries we finally turn to the subject of finite temperature .",
    "the discussion mimicks that of the @xmath2 case in that we will start from the eleven - dimensional gravity dual ( section [ sec : finitetempsugra ] ) and then progress via type iia to the gauge - theory ( section  [ sec : finitetempft ] ) . here",
    "we study the quark - antiquark potential , the shear - viscosity , and parton energy loss as it is parametrized by the jet - quenching factor @xmath18 and the drag - force .",
    "the conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] are followed with an appendix reviewing the bundle structure of the three - sphere ( appendix  [ sec : appendixbundles3 ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , sections [ sec : zerotempsugra ] , [ sec : zerotempgt ] and [ sec : appendixbundles3 ] contain mostly review material .",
    "and the @xmath19-potential in section [ sec : zerotempqqbarpotential ] have not been published in the literature so far . ] the reader familiar with the items discussed here might therefore prefer to start with section [ sec : finitetempsugra ] referring to the others when necessary .",
    "we begin with a review of the supergravity dual of the zero temperature theory . depending on the energy scale of of the processes one would like to study",
    "this is either eleven - dimensional m- or ten - dimensional type iia string theory .",
    "we follow a top - down approach , starting with the uv regime given by m - theory and ignoring the properties of the dual field theory until section [ sec : zerotempgt ] .",
    "we will see shortly that the gauge - theory we are interested in is living on the world volume of @xmath6 d6-branes wrapping a calibrated three - cycle in the deformed conifold . as mentioned before , the uv completion of this theory is given by m - theory on the spin bundle over @xmath5 , a manifold with @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "this setup was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this background is purely gravitational ( i.e.  all fields except the metric are set to zero ) and given by the metric @xmath20 ignoring the four dimensions of minkowski space , @xmath21 , this has asymptotically the structure of a cone with base @xmath22 .",
    "each sphere is parametrized by a set of one - forms @xmath23 , whose explicit form is @xmath24 with @xmath25 also note that @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the usual metric on @xmath28 with mostly positive signature .",
    "a look at the metric tells us that in opposite to @xmath5 , @xmath29 has a finite radius @xmath30 as we take @xmath31 .",
    "this resolves the singularity at @xmath32 .",
    "naturally one could also have picked the other sphere , @xmath5 , to do this . defining the volume of @xmath5 in this case to be @xmath33 with @xmath34",
    ", it appears as if the moduli space of m - theory on this space is given by @xmath35 .",
    "i.e.  the moduli space decomposes into two disconnected components .",
    "if we wanted to move from one sector to the other , we d have to pass through the singularity .",
    "however , as atiyah , maldacena , and vafa showed @xcite , it is indeed possible to continuously pass from one component to the other .",
    "the point is that m - theory contains also a three - form potential @xmath36 , and turning on a @xmath36 flux through one of the spheres smoothens out the singularity .",
    "denoting the flux by @xmath37 and writing @xmath38 , they showed that the true moduli space is the punctured complex plane consisting of a single path component .",
    "the resulting duality is known as the flop transition .    as mentioned , the metric has @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "being a subgroup of @xmath39 , @xmath0 may be embedded into @xmath40 .",
    "the spinor representation of the latter is an @xmath41 , which decomposes for the @xmath0 subgroup as @xmath42 . transporting any spinor @xmath43 around a closed loop",
    ", it transforms as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes a suitable representation . only the singlet is invariant under this operation .",
    "discarding all those spinor fields transforming unde the @xmath46 leaves us with @xmath47 of the original supersymmetry .",
    "as we started with @xmath48 supercharges , we are now dealing with a theory with @xmath49 supercharges .      a brief look at appendix [ sec : appendixbundles3 ]",
    "tells us that @xmath5 is a @xmath50 principal bundle over @xmath7 .",
    "thus when flowing towards the ir regime , and the size of the eleventh direction decreases , it is natural to perform a dimensional reduction along one of the two @xmath51s leading to an effective description in terms of type iia string theory on a space with topology @xmath52 if we choose an @xmath51 in the singular three - sphere , @xmath53 , the resulting geometry is a singular @xmath7 and a non - singular @xmath5 known as the deformed conifold .",
    "see fig .  [",
    "fig : dfold ] .",
    "the converse case , the resolved conifold , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfold ] . in general the conifold , as discussed in @xcite , is a six - dimensional non - compact manifold which is a cone with base @xmath54 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfold ] , there is a singularity at which both spheres have a vanishing radius . from a mathematician s point of view one",
    "deals with this singularity by giving one of the spheres a finite radius , leading to the deformed and the resolved conifold .",
    "physics allows for the following interpretation of this @xcite : if one considers the singularity as the @xmath55 limit of the deformed conifold , there is a logarithmic singularity in the metric .",
    "this may be interpreted as the result of having integrated out a field whose mass is dependent on @xmath30 , @xmath56 .",
    "when approaching the singularity , @xmath57 therefore the physical interpretation of the singularity lies in the fact that one has attempted to integrate out a massless field . as we will see in section [ sec : finitetempsugra11dimblackhole ] however , the finite temperature theory makes use of another method of dealing with the singularity .",
    "the theory will be defined on the singular conifold with the singularity hidden behind a black hole s event horizon .",
    "the string theory equivalent of the flop transition is the conifold transition@xcite .",
    "it relates the two geometries via a large @xmath6 duality . for small t",
    "hooft coupling @xmath58 one considers a stack of @xmath6 d6-branes wrapping the non - singular @xmath5 in the deformed conifold . taking the t hooft coupling large on the other hand one can not neglect the branes backreaction and does therefore pass to the resolved conifold . here",
    "the branes have disappeared and been replaced by @xmath6 units of two - form flux through the now blown up @xmath7 .",
    "being interested in a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma , we choose to reduce along the non - singular @xmath59 . before doing so , we have to identify the @xmath51 fibre along which we want to reduce .",
    "a generic three - sphere may be written as @xmath60 the coordinates @xmath61 are related to those of by @xmath62 tells us , that the projection @xmath63 acts on this as @xmath64 depending on the coordinate patch .",
    "one sees immediately that the fibre coordinate is @xmath65 , as it does not survive the projection .    before actually reducing we mod out by @xmath66",
    "this means a change in the periodicity of @xmath65 , @xmath67 as we will see soon , @xmath6 gives the @xmath68 flux through @xmath69 and therefore the number of d6-branes present in the dual type iia geometry .    in order to perform the reduction , we could simply expand the metric .",
    "however , there is a smarter way to go about this .",
    "defining @xmath70 we may rewrite the metric in terms of a new set of differential forms @xmath71 independent of @xmath72 , @xmath73 writing @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 we included several factors of @xmath30 to make sure that everything has the correct dimensions . dimensional reduction along an @xmath51 yields apart from the new metric @xmath76 a one - form potential and the dilaton .",
    "we may read them of from the eleven - dimensional metric @xmath77 using @xcite @xmath78 thus @xmath79 we will also need the ten - dimensional ricci scalar . in the string frame",
    "it reads @xmath80 @xmath81 is not singular at @xmath32 . as a matter of fact , @xmath82 which gives us an explicit expression for the conifold singularity in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "we claimed that in the above geometry there are @xmath6 units of ramond - ramond flux through the two - sphere . to check this",
    "we simply calculate the @xmath84 flux through the @xmath7 parametrized by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87    now the conifold transition relates the above to a stack of @xmath6 d6-branes on the deformed conifold .",
    "one may obtain this dual geometry from eleven - dimensional supergravity by reducing along the singular three - sphere .",
    "indications towards the presence of the branes are the resulting one - form potential , which couples magnetically to the branes , and the behavior of the ricci scalar near the singularity .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we shall now turn to the discussion of the dual gauge theory at @xmath2 . with the exception of the yang - mills coupling in section [ sec : zerotempgtcoupling ] and the @xmath19-potential in section [ sec : zerotempqqbarpotential ]",
    "this section contains mostly review material .",
    "the relation between the supergravity backgrounds , the gauge theory , and gauged supergravity was exhibited in @xcite . for a review on this issue see @xcite .      in the following",
    "we elaborate on the developments in @xcite . to find the super yang - mills theory s coupling constant @xmath88 , we place a d6-probe brane at constant @xmath89 , extending along @xmath90 and wrapping the resolved conifold s @xmath5",
    ". recall that we may think of our original stack of d6-branes as wrapping @xmath29 in the deformed conifold .",
    "we also fix the brane s position in the @xmath7 to be @xmath91 .",
    "the general idea is to identify the gauge field living on the probe brane with that of the dual super yang - mills theory .",
    "thus we may extract information about the dual theory from the probe s dbi action .",
    "using world - volume coordinates @xmath92 and labeling the brane - tension @xmath93 , we expand the dbi action in powers of @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 denotes the pullback onto the brane . for the embedding we have chosen , the induced metric @xmath97 is @xmath98 now notice that after kaluza - klein decomposition the massless modes of @xmath99 are functions of the @xmath90 alone , while all the other terms in do not depend on the flat part of the world - volume .",
    "therefore that part of ( [ eq : dbiaction ] ) containing @xmath100 may be written as @xmath101 comparing the yang - mills action @xmath102 and using the explicit expression for the d - brane tension @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104 note that the coupling is dimensionless , as it should be the case for a four - dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "we have plotted @xmath88 in figure [ fig : zerotempgtcouplings ] .",
    "the ads / cft dictionary tells us that we may relate the radial coordinate @xmath89 to the energy scale . to obtain a precise relation",
    "one may consider chiral symmetry breaking and the vev of the gluino condensate @xmath105 @xcite . yet for our purposes it is sufficient to think of @xmath106 as the uv regime of the gauge theory and @xmath31 as the ir . and @xcite .",
    "] then clearly shows asymptotic freedom .      we shall take a look at the massless excitations .",
    "prior to wrapping , the theory living on the world volume of @xmath6 d6-branes is a super yang - mills theory with @xmath107 supercharges , as the branes are half - bps . upon wrapping ,",
    "the global symmetries break as @xmath108 from dimensional analysis it follows that the kaluza - klein modes become relevant at energy scales of order @xmath109 ignoring all massive modes , the bosonic sector includes now the gauge potential and three massless scalars transforming as a @xmath110 under the r - symmetry .",
    "the representation for the fermions changes under from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "this is not the complete picture however .",
    "consider the behavior of the gravitino under susy transformations , @xmath113 with @xmath114 being the spin connection .",
    "for the theory to be supersymmetric we need a covarianntly constant spinor satisfying @xmath115 . as the spin structure of @xmath5",
    "does not allow for such a spinor to exist , supersymmetry is completely broken upon wrapping . raising the status of the r - symmetry to that of a gauge symmetry",
    ", we may modify to @xmath116 fixing @xmath117 resolves the issue .",
    "this topological twist was first introduced by witten in @xcite . while it changes the behavior of the @xmath118 dimensional theory significantly , the consequence for the @xmath119 dimensional one we are interested in consists in keeping only those fields that transform as a singlet under the diagonal @xmath120 the gauge potential is not affected by the whole construction , whereas all of the scalars disappear from the spectrum .",
    "the representation of the fermions decomposes as @xmath121 because @xmath122 .",
    "so recalling that the branes are half - bps we are left with @xmath123 supercharges , confirming the previous calculation based on the holonomy of the eleven - dimensional background .",
    "thus the massless spectrum is given by pure @xmath4 super yang - mills theory .",
    "knowing the energy scale of the kk - modes ( [ eq : zerotempgtkkscale ] ) and the behavior of the ricci scalar ( [ eq : zerotempiiaricciscalar ] ) , the yang - mills coupling constant ( [ eq : zerotempymcoupling ] ) , and the dilaton ( [ eq : zerotempiiadilatone ] ) enables us to address the issue at which energy scales the system is best described by super yang - mills , type iia , or m - theory .",
    "as in the previous section we do not know the precise relation between the radial coordinate @xmath89 and the energy scale @xmath124 in question , and are therefore only able to make qualitative statements identifying the large-@xmath89 regime as the uv and vice versa .",
    "figure [ fig : zerotempgtcouplings ] shows the behavior of all three relevant quantities .",
    "we see that in the ir the relevant degrees of freedom are best described in type iia theory .",
    "while it might seem that the uv completion is given by both m - theory and super yang - mills one should not forget that figure [ fig : zerotempgtcouplings ] shows the four - dimensional gauge coupling . at sufficiently high energies",
    "the @xmath4 theory will begin to fully explore the compact dimensions ; the gauge theory becomes @xmath118 dimensional .",
    "purely gravitational m - theory gives the only uv - completion .",
    "if we want to use this overall setup to study zero - temperature , non - perturbative gauge dynamics , it follows from ( [ eq : zerotempgtkkscale ] ) that we want the resolution parameter @xmath30 to satisfy @xmath125 .",
    "however we also need @xmath126 for @xmath31 , these quantities behave as @xmath127 comparing this with figure [ fig : zerotempgtcouplings ] we conclude that there is a limit for @xmath128 in which the supergravity approximation captures non - perturbative gauge dynamics",
    ". however the massive kaluza - klein modes do not fully decouple and thus spoil the behavior of pure @xmath4 super yang - mills .",

    "[ [ mathematics ] ] mathematics    from a purely formal point of view , the first indication for noncommutativity is that one needs the lagrangian to be imaginary in order for the expectation value to be real .",
    "this leads to @xmath388 now regard . in going from the second line to the third ,",
    "we need to assume @xmath389 while this is a pretty strong assumption , it is certainly satisfied if one takes the @xmath355 limit first .",
    "this corresponds with the ansatz taken in @xcite where the authors work with a light - like worldsheet in the first place .",
    "[ [ physics ] ] physics    as to physics , one need to consider that different types of wilson loops may be used to study different physical problems . on the one hand , we have jet - quenching , related to a wilson loop which is again related to the exponential of a real quantity .",
    "this is the regime @xmath390 . on the other",
    "there is the behavior of the ( possibly moving ) @xmath19 pair , where the wilson loop is related to the exponential of an imaginary quantity .",
    "here we have @xmath391 . between these two regions",
    "there is a discontinuity at @xmath392 .",
    "the authors of @xcite go on to point out that if @xmath393 but @xmath394 , the screening length @xmath395 is given by @xmath396 also , there is a size @xmath397 associated with every external quark , given by @xmath398 @xmath399 is the mass of the quark .",
    "so at the singularity , the screening length is similiar to the size of the quark @xmath400 now if @xmath401 which confirms that the string represents a quarkonium meson . if we trust the above formulas to be true in the limit @xmath402 , albeit not having assumed this when defining @xmath395 , we realize that because of @xmath403 the quark is bigger than its screening length , meaning that there are no @xmath19 bound states .",
    "so there are two different regimes with different physics , depending on @xmath404 if we want to examine certain physics , we have to make a choice on how to take the limit .",
    "while the jet - quenching method described above only uses the gauge / gravity correspondence to calculate the expectation value of a wilson line , the concept of the drag force , which was introduced in @xcite , is fully based on the existence of a holographic dual .",
    "the main idea is that if one is able to describe a massive quark - antiquark pair as an open string whose both ends are attached to a probe brane at large radius , one might be able to think of a single quark as a single string stretching from the probe to the horizon .",
    "again one uses the nambu - goto action in order to study the string s dynamics .",
    "generically the movement of the quark trough the plasma is governed by @xmath405 where @xmath406 is the quarks momentum , @xmath124 a damping coefficient , and @xmath218 a possible external force .",
    "there are two situations of interest here .",
    "@xmath407 and @xmath408 .    in the first case",
    ", it follows that @xmath409 and therefore @xmath410 one may extract @xmath124 numerically from a quasi normal mode analysis of a string stretching between the probe and the boundary .",
    "we shall however not perform the numerical analysis and instead only focus on the second case . a quark moving at a constant speed through the plasma satisfies @xmath408 . yet",
    "as the plasma is continuously draining the quark s energy , there has to be an external force @xmath218 constantly repleneshing the quark s energy and momentum .",
    "again we place the probe brane at @xmath411 . to study a single open string hanging down to the horizon",
    ", we assume a profile of the form @xmath412 where in opposite to we allow @xmath164 to depend on the time .",
    "the nambu - goto action yields the following equations of motion @xmath413 where we defined @xmath414    we shall now examine the properties of a specific time - dependent solution . as we will see",
    "one may extract information about the string and the quark it describes without fully solving the equations of motion .",
    "assume @xmath415 , a constant . then the equations and simplify to @xmath416 and @xmath417 as @xmath418 .",
    "this can be integrated once and solved for @xmath419 to give @xmath420 where @xmath37 is a constant of integration .    plugging this back into , yields @xmath421    we want the string to reach the horizon . to see whether this is possible , we need to check if the solution is well defined in the region @xmath422 .",
    "as usual one needs to require @xmath423 . from @xmath424 it follows that @xmath425 is real if that is the case for @xmath426 .",
    "a look at tells us that we can not avoid its numerator to change the sign as long as @xmath427 . hence one needs to make sure that both the numerator and the denominator change sign at the same radial position @xmath428 .",
    "this amounts to solving @xmath429 for @xmath37 .",
    "the former equation leads to @xmath430 , from which it follows that @xmath431 hence the energy and momentum loss are @xmath432 going back to , setting @xmath433 , taking for @xmath434 , and making use of the relativistic relation @xmath435 , leads to @xmath436    this result has some interesting properties .",
    "as long as we consider @xmath94 to be finite , the strict @xmath437 limit leads to a vanishing @xmath438 .",
    "so in this case there is no radiative energy loss .",
    "this agrees nicely with the vanishing of the jet - quenching factor @xmath18 studied in section [ sec : jet - quenching ] .",
    "furthermore even extends that result to quarks of any non - vanishing mass .",
    "one needs to bring the probe brane arbitrarily close to the horizon .",
    "one should assume that something should happen in this case , i.e.  the brane might fall into the horizon .",
    "] if we only take @xmath6 to be large however , equation seems rather awkward , as the damping decreases the faster the probe moves .",
    "also one should not forget that we need @xmath94 to be small in order to use the supergravity approximation .",
    "more precisely , as was studied in section [ sec : finitetempgtproperties ] , the t hooft coupling behaves as @xmath439 .",
    "thus @xmath440 so making a definite statement about the fate of the damping coefficient @xmath124 requires a more rigorous study of the relation between the gauge- and the string theory s couplings and energy scales .",
    "we have constructed a new solution to the equations of motion of eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "as our discussion of its thermodynamical properties in section [ sec : thermodynamics ] shows there is reason to doubt that it is dual to a four - dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature , leaving us with the question what the field - theory dual of the background in question is .",
    "our comparison with the four- and eleven - dimensional schwarzschild black holes shows however that the surprising thermodynamical features are to be expected from a solution that is purely gravitational in eleven dimensions .",
    "therefore one might expect to find a better supergravity dual upon generalizing the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz - for - black - hole ] ) such that the black hole is charged under the three - form gauge field of eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "albeit these problems we were able to exhibit some of the expected features of a gauge - dual at @xmath441 , such as deconfinement and the universal ratio of shear - viscosity and entropy density .",
    "further pathologies of our background are the negative specific heat and the vanishing parton energy loss .    as to the issue of the specific heat",
    "one should call to mind the work done by gubser and mitra @xcite , indicating that in fairly general settings a thermodynamic instability is leading to a dynamical one .",
    "one might also consider the following : while our derivation of the shear - viscosity to entropy ratio uses the concept of the stretched horizon introduced by kovtun , son , and starinets @xcite , one expects to obtain the same universal result from the more standard calculation based on the evaluation of the kubo - relations .",
    "now as the derivation of photon and dilepton production in the dual plasma @xcite is quite similiar ot that of the shear - viscosity one might conjecture these quantities to behave better then the energy loss that was was discussed in this paper .",

    "<S> while one finds the expected behavior for the potential and the viscosity  deconfinement and the universal shear - viscosity to entropy ratio  both the jet quenching parameter and the calculation of the drag force lead us to the conclusion that there is no parton energy loss in the dual plasma . </S>",
