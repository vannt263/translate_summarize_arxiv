    "it is widely known that stars with outer convective zones , in terms of their chromospheric line emission , exhibit twofold behavior .",
    "younger , rapidly rotating stars have the power of the chromospheric emission higher by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude than slowly rotating , older stars @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the emission in these two classes of stars is related with different physical processes : the low emission of slow rotators represents the effect of acoustic , nonmagnetic heating , while the higher emission of fast rotators is caused by effects of magnetic activity @xcite . in the last decade it became increasingly clear that various slowly rotating , solar - type stars , with well - developed convection zones , have similar chromospheric emission .",
    "the available observational evidence suggests @xcite that this emission is caused , at least partially , by the upward propagation and dissipation of sound ( acoustic ) waves .",
    "on the other hand , statistical analysis of existing ultraviolet ( uv ) emission data of solar - type stars across the h - r diagram , has shown the presence of a characteristic , well - pronounced  basal \" level of _ chromospheric heating _",
    "it is commonly assumed that the heating may be caused by the nonlinear acoustic wave shock - heating mechanism , but the dynamics of this phenomenon is not completely understood .",
    "moreover , the direct examination of goddard high - resolution spectrograph data of several evolved stars , having similar  basal \" levels of chromospheric activity , failed to detect a definite evidence in favor of the presence of acoustic waves , presumably a key component of the heating mechanism . instead , in a number of cases , a counter - intuitive behavior ,",
    "reminiscent of the _ solar transition region _ was detected , suggesting rather _ a magnetic heating mechanism _ for these stars .",
    "this controversy led to the tentative conclusion that upward - propagating shock waves do not necessarily dominate the observed radiative losses from chromospheres of stars exhibiting typical  basal \" behaviour . more generally , the nonmagnetic nature of the basal components of convective",
    ", solar - type stars has been called in question",
    ".    in solar physics the problem of the chromospheric heating has been discussed ever since it was found out that the chromosphere is hotter than the photosphere .",
    "originally it was proposed @xcite that the solar chromosphere is heated via the dissipation of acoustic waves generated by the overshooting convection zone turbulence .",
    "a theoretical model , determining the spectrum and power of these waves , had been developed on the basis of the lighthill - stein theory @xcite of the convective zone acoustic wave emission .",
    "it was suggested that the dissipation of turbulently created acoustic waves may explain the observed chromospheric heating in the sun . in this model",
    "it was supposed @xcite that the heating takes place in the granules .",
    "alternatively , it may also occur in the lanes between granules @xcite , where the acoustic monopole emission may induce the chromospheric oscillations . at any rate both",
    "these scenarios were based on the assumption , confirmed by various observations of the solar chromosphere , that the acoustic mechanism of heating may be important in regions where the magnetic field is of a little significance both dynamically and energetically .    however , similarly to the situation with other solar - type stars , this explanation of the chromospheric heating has difficulties also for the sun .",
    "the analysis of solar data from the _ sumer(solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ) _ instrument on soho , analogously to the above - mentioned data from other slowly rotating , solar - type stars , revealed serious problems with the nonlinear acoustic - shock - wave interpretation and has underlined the necessity for the further investigation of this issue .",
    "observations with _ trace _ _ ( transition region and coronal explorer ) _ nasa space telescope - revealed a very substantial ( about @xmath0 ! ) deficit in the energy flux required to heat the nonmagnetic , quiet solar chromosphere @xcite .",
    "later some light on this puzzle was shed by numerical simulations with a three - dimensional hydrodynamic code .",
    "it was argued @xcite that this puzzling discrepancy may arise due to the limited spatial resolution of the _ trace _ , failing to detect most of the acoustic waves traveling in quiet - sun inter - network regions of the chromosphere . in particular , @xcite discussed the problems of the limited sensitivity of trace while studying the three - dimensional solar chromospheric topology ; they reconsidered the acoustic chromospheric wave energy flux and related this problem with the heating and emission of chromospheric basal flux for @xmath1 ceti type stars .",
    "it was concluded that , contrary to claims by fossum & carlsson , high - frequency acoustic waves are sufficient to heat the nonmagnetic solar chromosphere .",
    "recently various alternative scenarios of the chromospheric heating for solar - type , cool stars with partially ionized chromospheres have been proposed .",
    "it was argued that the farley - buneman @xcite plasma instability may provide the mechanism for conversion of the energy of convective motions of neutral atoms into the chromospheric heating @xcite .",
    "however @xcite , taking into account the finite magnetization of the ions and coulomb collisions , re - evaluated the instability for the solar chromosphere and argued that it could hardly be fully responsible for the observed level of quasi - steady heating .    therefore , the problem of the chromospheric heating remains an actual and unsolved problem in the physics of slowly rotating , solar - type stars and the sun .",
    "putting the problem in plain words , it is observationally obvious that the chromospheres of stars with extended convective zones are hotter than their photospheres .",
    "this is true for both younger , rapidly rotating stars with magnetically active chromospheres and for older stars , with slower rotation rates and hydrodynamic , nonmagnetic chromospheres .",
    "@xcite has recently considered both possible mechanisms - the magnetic and the nonmagnetic ( acoustic ) ones - that might be responsible for the solar chromospheric heating .",
    "he argued @xcite that the emission of the nonmagnetic chromosphere exhibits some characteristic features of acoustic waves and no signatures of magnetic waves .",
    "still , in general , the problem _ is _ complicated . from the existing observational , theoretical and numerical studies of the  chromospheric heating problem \" for cool , slowly rotating , solar - type stars , it turns out that the problem does nt have a single , broadly accepted solution .",
    "rather , it seems likely that there may exist several different channels ( mechanisms ) of the chromospheric heating .",
    "it is a challenging task to specify these mechanisms and to provide at least a qualitative description of their relative importance .",
    "it seems evident that at any rate the chromospheric heating by acoustic waves takes place .",
    "the question is whether nonlinear heating by means of acoustic shock - waves is the only , or dominant , hydrodynamic channel of the heating or there are other acoustic processes of the energy transfer from waves to the medium that could lead to the chromospheric heating .",
    "the role of the chromospheric _ flows _ and their kinematic complexity is possibly one of those important issues that has to be tested in the chromospheric heating context .",
    "it is well - known that the structure of the solar chromosphere is approximately spherically symmetric for about the first 2000 km .",
    "higher layers show complex and variable fine structure , consisting of a wide variety of _ flow patterns _ - spicules , fibrils , surges @xcite .",
    "recent observations by _ hinode _ strengthened this picture , showing that the chromosphere often hosts giant @xmath2 jets @xcite .",
    "it is now widely believed that the solar chromosphere , both in its active and quiet phases is highly dynamic and highly inhomogeneous consisting of numerous flows (  velocity patterns \" ) with different spatial / temporal time - scales and different geometries .",
    "these flows are closely related to the _ chromospheric network _ - a web - like structure seen in the emissions of the red line of hydrogen ( @xmath2 ) and the ultraviolet line of calcium ( ca  ii  k ) .",
    "the network is formed and maintained due to the presence of bundles of magnetic field lines ceaselessly shuffled and reshuffled by the fluid motions .    in particular",
    ", common ingredients of the solar chromosphere are _ spicules _ ( small , jet - like ejections commonly observed throughout the chromospheric network ) , _ macro - spicules _ and _ solar tornadoes _",
    "these flows are characterized by spatially inhomogeneous velocity fields : shear flows with a nontrivial geometry and a poorly known but considerable kinematic complexity .",
    "it is well - known that collective phenomena in shear flows are strongly affected by so - called _ nonmodal processes _ , related with the non - self - adjointness of the operator describing the linear dynamics of perturbations @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are especially robust and versatile in flows with nontrivial kinematics and geometries . in particular",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that under favourable conditions a hydrodynamic , linear system may exhibit strongly pronounced unstable regimes , where due to the efficient amplification of waves a large part of the mean flow kinetic energy is pumped into the unstable modes fostered by the flows . on the other hand",
    ", it was demonstrated that if viscous dissipation is present , the large amplitude , nonmodally amplified waves undergo viscous dissipation , leading to the conversion of the wave energy into thermal energy and corresponding _  self - heating \" _ @xcite of the  parent \" flows .",
    "the physics of the self - heating in a differentially moving medium ( shear flow ) is quite generic and comprises the following three steps : ( a ) the waves , originally , are excited spontaneously within the shear flow ; ( b ) they undergo nonmodal amplification , they grow , extracting a part of the mean flow s kinetic energy .",
    "these processes are quite efficient in neutral fluids @xcite and both in electrostatic @xcite and magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "( c ) nonmodally amplified large - amplitude waves undergo , as the final stage of their evolution , viscous decay : they get damped and give their energy back to the  parent \" flow in the form of heat .",
    "evidently the crucial element of this three - step process is the second one : nonmodal amplification of waves by the flow .",
    "the first and the last ones - spontaneous excitation of waves and their viscous damping - are routinely taking place in all kinds of continuous media .",
    "the possibility of the nonmodal amplification of collective modes in shear flows , however , creates a chance for the waves to amplify _ before _ they get damped !",
    "the energy needed for the amplification is drawn from the  reservoir \" of the shear flow kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "eventual damping of these larger - amplitude waves and conversion of their excessive energy into the heat leads to the overall heating of the medium . since this",
    "process converts , via the agency of nonmodally amplified waves , the kinetic energy of the flow into its thermal energy the process can be called self - heating .",
    "self - heating was originally described for acoustic waves in a hydrodynamic shear flow @xcite , but later it was found @xcite that self - heating occurs in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shear flows too .",
    "the particularly robust nature of the nonmodal amplification in kinematically complex flows @xcite suggested that self - heating could be especially well pronounced in flows with complicated geometry and kinematics .    since the solar chromosphere reveals the abundant presence of various nontrivial velocity patterns , and there is no reason to believe that chromospheric zones of other solar - type stars are any different it is reasonable to investigate the above mentioned mechanism in the context of the chromospheric heating for the slowly rotating , solar - type stars . in the present paper",
    "we consider the nonmodal self - heating mechanism in hydrodynamic , kinematically complex flows and study the energy dissipation rate of acoustic waves in the context of the possible relevance of this process to chromospheric flows .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way : in section  ii , we derive the equations governing the linear evolution of perturbations of the hydrodynamic system and consider the self - heating occurring within a kinematically complex flow . in section  iii , we apply this model to the chromospheric flows and solve the set of equations numerically for different parameter regimes . in section",
    "iv , we discuss the obtained results and outline the directions of further , more detailed , quantitative and applicative studies .",
    "in order to show the efficiency of the self - heating for acoustic waves generated , nonmodally amplified and viscously dissipated in kinematically complex shear flows , we consider the following standard hydrodynamic set , consisting of the equations of mass conservation : @xmath3 the momentum conservation : @xmath4 and the polytropic equation of state : @xmath5    in these equations , @xmath6 denotes the convective derivative , @xmath7 is the density , @xmath8 is the velocity , @xmath9 is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and @xmath10 is the polytropic index .",
    "the instantaneous values of the physical variables are expressed as sums of their equilibrium and perturbational components : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 in the present study , for the sake of simplicity , the density of the fluid in the unperturbed state is assumed to be homogeneous ( @xmath14 ) .    applying the standard procedure of linearization to eqs .",

    "instead we will follow the approach originally developed and used in @xcite which applies to a broad range of possible flow patterns . doing so we expand the velocity in a taylor series in the vicinity of a point @xmath20 . preserving only linear terms",
    "we write : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the initial set of linearized partial differential equations ( [ con],[eul ] ) is transformed to the set of _ ordinary _ differential equations by means of the usage of the following ansatz for the system s physical variables : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 s are the unperturbed velocity components and @xmath28 s are the wave vector components .",

    "the viscosity must be strong enough to ensure the feedback mechanism , i.e.  the transfer of the energy acquired by the waves back to the flow via viscous damping .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that strongly pronounced self - heating occurs only when there is a certain balance between the instability and viscous time - scales @xcite . neither in the case of _ weak nonmodal amplification _ ( i.e.  when the waves do not have enough time to grow before the viscosity kicks in ) , nor in the case of _ negligibly weak viscosity _",

    "it is well - known that shear flows with a considerable kinematic complexity are subject to various , nonmodal instabilities , sometimes of a parametric nature @xcite .",

    "the velocity amplitude of upward - propagating acoustic waves grows due to the exponential decrease of the mass density with height ; leading , in turn , to shock formation and dissipation of the acoustic waves and heating of the medium .",
    "the important feature of this mechanism is the exponential dependence of the mass density on height , because for a medium with @xmath139 this classic scenario does not work .",

    "we have solved these equations for several , representative examples of flow patterns and found out that the instability and the viscous damping might lead to quite efficient self - heating of the  parent \" flows . analyzing the kinetic energy budget of a typical chromospheric macro - spicule",
    ", we found out that the self - heating might extract a significant part of kinetic energy from the velocity pattern in time - scales of the same order as the lifetimes of the corresponding structures observed in the solar chromosphere .",
    "therefore , it is quite logical to believe that self - heating of chromospheric flow patterns contributes to the overall heating of the chromosphere by converting a considerable part of their kinetic energy into heat and ultimately destroying these flow patterns .",

    "<S> subsequently , the presence of viscous dissipation damps these amplified waves and causes the energy transfer back to the background flow in the form of heat ; viz . closes the `` self - heating '' cycle and contributes to the net heating of the flow patterns and the chromospheric network as a whole . </S>",
