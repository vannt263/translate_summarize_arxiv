    "the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) was observed in october 1998 by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "it is the southern counterpart of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) and shares its characteristics of depth and spatial resolution .",
    "the hdf - s is a four arcmin@xmath8 survey located at ra 22@xmath9 32@xmath10 56@xmath11 , dec -60@xmath12 33 02  , observed during 150 orbits with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "hdf - s images cover a wavelength range from the ultraviolet to near - infrared with 4 broad - band filters : f300w , f450w , f606w , f814w .",
    "details about observations and data reduction may be found in the   hubble   deep   field   south   web page ( http://www.stsci.edu/ ftp / science / hdfsouth / hdfs.html ) .",
    "the main goal of these surveys , hdf - n and hdf - s , is to study faint galaxies , in particular to investigate the nature of the faint blue galaxies excess and the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. ellis 1997 ) .",
    "faint galaxy counts have been of paramount importance to show that galaxies do evolve with redshift , even if the overall scenario and the physical processes that led to evolution are still debated .",
    "an excess of observed galaxies with respect to a no - evolution model begins to appear at b@xmath13 ( e.g. maddox et al .",
    "1990 ; jones et al . 1991 ; metcalfe et al . 1991 ) and continues to rise up to b@xmath14 ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1995 ) exceeding by a factor 4 to 10 , depending on the choice of @xmath15 ( 0 - 0.5 ) and on the lf ( see e.g. koo & kron 1992 ; ellis 1997 ) .",
    "this excess has actually undoubtly proved that galaxies evolve .",
    "however , the analysis of the optical data have not offered a unequivocal interpretation : the steepening of the faint end luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies at high redshifts ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) suggests that either the typical luminosity of galaxies was brighter by @xmath16 magnitude at @xmath17 or that there were 2 - 3 times more galaxies at this epoch .",
    "most likely both luminosity and number density evolution are acting : luminosity evolution seems to play an important role at least on disk galaxies as shown by the results obtained by schade et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on the cfrs - ldss sample . on the other hand also mergers of galaxies seem to significantly contribute to the evolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of the universe at least down to @xmath18 ( le fvre et al .",
    "2000 ) . analyzing high resolution ground based imaging of blue galaxies at redshift @xmath19 , colless et al .",
    "( 1994 ) actually noticed that most of them have a close companion at a projected distance of about 10 kpc .",
    "this result suggests the presence of merging at @xmath20 , which could increase the star formation , explaining the blue colors of the sources .",
    "disentangling the effects of luminosity and number density evolution is fundamental in understanding the nature of field galaxy formation and evolution , allowing a direct comparison with models .",
    "for instance , semi - analytical models of galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering scenarios , assuming that galaxies assemble through successive merger events from smaller sub - units , make concrete predictions about the evolution of merger rate , morphological mix and relative redshift distribution ( e.g. baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . in this scenario",
    "the number density of galaxies should increase with redshift , their sizes should decrease and the fraction of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath21 ) in an ir - selected sample should be very low .",
    "moreover the morphological mix should change in favour of late type and irregular galaxies which thus would dominate both galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the high redshift tail of the redshift distribution , where a lack of elliptical galaxies should be observed .",
    "most of these predictions have been the object of detailed analysis of data resulting in conflicting results .",
    "for instance , some works claim a deficit of ellipticals at @xmath22 ( zepf 1997 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al . 1999 ) and a very low fraction ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath21 galaxies in a k@xmath24 selected sample ( fontana et al . 1999 ) . on",
    "the contrary other authors find a constant comoving density of ellipticals down to @xmath25 ( e.g. bentez et al .",
    "1999 ; broadhurst & bowens 2000 ) and a strong clustering signal of eros in k - selected samples ( daddi et al .",
    "hst medium deep survey ( mds ) , on the other hand , indicates that a large fraction of galaxies at moderate redshift ( @xmath26 ) are actually intrinsically faint and exhibit peculiar morphologies suggestive of merging ( griffiths et al .",
    "1994 ; driver et al .",
    "1995 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 ; neuschaefer et al .",
    "the results derived from the morphological analysis on the hdf - n data ( van den bergh et al .",
    "1996 ; abraham et al . 1996",
    "; driver et al . 1998 ) seem to confirm the high fraction of apparent irregular / peculiar galaxies with respect to the local universe which may be the cause of the faint blue galaxies excess ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) stress also that hdf - n galaxies show a strong bluing color trend : while red galaxies are compatible with an elliptical galaxy colors , most of blue sources are bluer than an irregular galaxy , and these colors might be accounted for only considering luminosity evolution .",
    "thus it seems that the overall evolutionary scenario is still missed and the understanding of the contribution of the different populations of galaxies to this scenario rather confused .    in this work we present an analysis of number counts , colors and morphological distributions of hdf - s galaxies in an attempt to reveal and better constraint the evolving populations of galaxies .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we summarize the steps leading to the creation of the catalogue , the computation of optical galaxy counts is explained in section 3 , in section 4 the technique used to determine galaxy colors . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results , both counts and colors , while in section 6 we present and discuss morphological number counts and in section 7 , by adding the information given by photometric redshifts and number counts models , we disentangle the contribution of different galaxy populations and discuss the interpretation of redshift distributions .",
    "finally , in section 8 we summarize our results and express our conclusions .",
    "the samples here used are not extracted from the public hdf - s catalogs available on the web . on the contrary",
    "they have been independently created beginning from the optical hst images in order to have a control of the detection procedure and of magnitude estimate .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure adopted and the selection criteria used to obtain the catalogs in the different bands , as well as magnitude estimates , can be found in volonteri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . here",
    "we briefly describe the steps related to the derivation of number counts .",
    "the object detection was performed across the area observed in optical bands ( wfpc2 field ) using sextractor ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "images were first smoothed with a gaussian function having fwhm equal to the one measured on the images ( @xmath27 0.2 arcsec ) .",
    "a detection threshold of 1 sigma per pixel and a minimum detection area equal to the seeing disk ( @xmath28 arcsec@xmath29 pixel ) were adopted to peak up objects .",
    "this threshold corresponds to a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the faintest sources detectable on the wf area and on the pc area respectively .    in table 1",
    "we report for each filter the zero - point ( ab magnitude , oke 1974 ) , the sky rms estimated by sextractor and the corresponding 5@xmath32 limiting magnitude for a point source .",
    ".rms sky values and 5@xmath32 magnitude limit for the different bands .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     completeness correction for faint undetected sources strongly depends on the source apparent spatial structure and on their magnitude .",
    "the high resolution of hdf - s images allows the detection of sub - galactic structures , such as hii regions .",
    "moreover the light observed from a high fraction of the galaxies in the hdf - s is emitted in the uv and f450w pass - bands , so that the observed morphology is strongly affected by star formation episodes .",
    "these features imply that `` typical '' profiles of galaxies are not able to well describe the shapes of a lot of galaxies in the hdf - s .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the manifold of shapes which characterizes sources in the hdf - s , following saracco et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we generated a set of simulated frames by directly dimming the original frames by various factors while keeping constant the rms .",
    "this procedure has allowed us to avoid any assumption on the source profile providing an artificial fair dimmed sample in a real background noise even if it can not take into account differences due to evolution .",
    "we thus define the correction factor @xmath33 as the mean number of dimmed galaxies which should enter the fainter magnitude bin over the mean number of detected ones . in table .",
    "2 we report the raw counts @xmath34 , the completeness correction factor @xmath33 , the counts per square degree corrected for incompleteness @xmath35 and their errors @xmath36 .",
    "colley et al . (",
    "1996 ) suggested that galaxies in the hdf - n may suffer from a wrong selection .",
    "high redshift galaxies on optical images have a lumpy appearance : first the redshift moves the ultraviolet rest - frame light into the optical , so   galaxies   are   observed   in uv rest - frame , where star - forming regions are more prominent ; second the fraction of irregular galaxies is higher than locally ( van den bergh et al .",
    "1996 , abraham et al . 1996 ) and a large number of galaxies may display asymmetry and multiple structure .",
    "we treated this feature analyzing our sample in f814w and f450w .",
    "the f814w - band catalogue should suffer less from the effects described above , being selected in the reddest filter , the vice versa is true for the f450w - band catalogue ( but see volonteri et al .",
    "2000 for a more detailed analysis ) .",
    "about 20 - 30@xmath37 of sources in f450w - band catalogue have separation @xmath38 arcsec .",
    "we therefore analyzed these sources , by cross - correlating f814w and f450w catalogues . in the f450w - band catalogue we selected pairs with a separation @xmath38 arcsec",
    "which were not included in the f814w - band catalogue .",
    "these objects were single sources split in the f450w - band ( with f450w@xmath39 27 - 29 ) , corresponding to a single detection in the f814w - band .",
    "we then used sextractor on the f450w frame , after choosing a higher deblend_mincont@xmath40 .",
    "87 sources , with @xmath41f450w@xmath42 , corresponding to about 7@xmath37 of the whole sample , were then considered as single galaxies . in figure [ bb ]",
    "counts obtained with the uncorrected catalogue are shown as stars , while corrected counts are shown as empty circles . in the faintest bins the correction is within the error , accounting for less than 10@xmath37 of the counts .",
    "errors were obtained by quadratically summing the poissonian contribution @xmath43 of raw counts , the contribution due to clustering fluctuation @xmath44 being @xmath45 the angular correlation function , and the uncertainty on the correction factor @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of frames dimmed for each dimming factor .",
    "assuming that the amplitude @xmath48 evolves with magnitude on the basis of the relation log@xmath49 ( brainerd et al .",
    "1994 ; roche et al .",
    "1996 ) we derived @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    the number counts here derived in the f300w and f450w bands and in the f606w and f814w bands are shown in figures [ countsvi ] and [ countsbu ] together with those from the literature .",
    "the relation between counts and magnitude may be written as @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the knee @xmath56 is at b@xmath2725 ( lilly et al .",
    "1991 , metcalfe et al . 1995 ) , and the value of @xmath57 varies between 0.4 and 0.6 according to the band and analogously for @xmath58 it varies between 0.2 and 0.5 .",
    "we estimated both @xmath57 and @xmath58 in f450w@xmath0 , f606w@xmath0 and f814w@xmath0 , obtaining for @xmath57 : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and for @xmath58 : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the most notable feature appears in the f300w - band counts : these are described by a slope @xmath65 which is much steeper than the value @xmath66 derived by williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and pozzetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on the hdf - n data in the same magnitude range",

    "( @xmath67 ; 1997 ) and fontana et al .",
    "( @xmath68 ; 1999 ) , does not depend on a possible over - estimate of the incompleteness in the faintest magnitude bins : the same slope is actually described by counts at magnitudes u@xmath69 where the sample is 100@xmath37 complete .",
    "moreover the f300w - band counts do not show evidence of any turnover or flattening down to f300w@xmath0=27 , contrary to what is claimed by pozzetti et al .",
    "we will discuss this issue in section 5.1 . the amplitude and slope of the number counts in the whole range of magnitudes in the other optical bands are in a good agreement with those previously derived by other authors .",
    "we estimated @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath70 for the f450w@xmath0 , f606w@xmath0 and f814w@xmath0 counts respectively .",
    "in order to measure colors unbiased with respect to the selection band , we created a _",
    "metaimage _ by summing all four frames , after normalizing them to the same rms sky noise ( see also volonteri et al .",
    "we run sextractor in the so - called double image mode : detection and isophote boundaries were measured on the combined image , while isophotal magnitudes were   measured   on   f300w , f450w , f606w , f814w images individually . using   this   procedure   ( moustakas   et   al .",
    "1997 )   both   object   detection   and   isophote determination are based on the summed image , and isophotes are not biased towards any of the bands .",
    "then we cross - correlated the catalogue obtained from the combined image with f814w and f300w samples selected according to our criteria ( see section 2 ) : we ended up by having two sample selections .",
    "starting from each sample , we assigned a lower limit in magnitude to sources undetected in any of other bands .",
    "the limiting magnitude is the 5@xmath32 isophotal magnitude within the isophote measured in the combined image . in figures",
    "[ colori_i1 ] , [ colori_i2 ] , [ colori_u1 ] , [ colori_u2 ] the color - magnitude diagrams of the two samples are shown together with the median locus .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviation from the mean of the values in each bin .",
    "the most notable feature is the initial trend towards blue colors followed by a flattening in the last bins .",
    "we then compared our colors with colors measured from spectra by coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 , cww hereafter ) after convolution with throughput curves for the wfpc2 filters . in each magnitude bin , we estimated the fraction of sources with ( f450w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 bluer  than  an  irregular galaxy at @xmath72 ( i.e. f450w@xmath73 f606w@xmath740.18 ) .",

    "our results show a decreasing slope at redder wavelengths for the whole sample , in good agreement with other works . the very   faint   end   is flatter than 0.2 in f450w@xmath0 , f606w@xmath0 , f814w@xmath0 , while in f300w@xmath0 the slope is steeper .  the  difference  with  pozzetti  et al .",
    "f300w@xmath0 counts is likely due to a different selection of the catalogue : they selected the sample   in   a   red   band  ( on   a summed f606w+f814w image ) to derive f300w - band counts and used the isophotal magnitude instead of a _ pseudo - total _ magnitude .",
    "they  assume  that  galaxies  fainter  than f606w@xmath42 have approximately a ( f300w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 color not bluer than the brighter galaxies , not biasing the red - selected sample against very blue objects .    in figure [ pozzu ]",
    "we show the ( f300w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 color as a function of f300w@xmath0 isophotal magnitude ( as pozzetti et al . ) for our f606w - selected sample , within the limiting f606w@xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) and for the f300w - selected one ( figure [ u ] ) .",
    "the colors for the f606w - selected sample are obtained as described in section 4 . in order to obtain a sample with characteristics similar to pozzetti et al .",

    "the f606w@xmath0 limiting magnitude biases the sample against blue objects , that is the last bins are affected by censored data ( see next section ) , thus making the ( f300w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 color appear redder . considering",
    "the bluing trend observed until f300w@xmath0=29 , and the fact that the f606w@xmath0 limiting magnitude biases the sample against blue objects , this implies that f300w - band counts recovered from a red - selected sample are affected by this color bias and consequently by incompleteness in the last bins .",
    "the flattening found by other authors may be mainly caused by the influence of such incompleteness ( noise being equally important for faint galaxies , be them at low or high redshift ) and not to the `` crossing '' of the lyman break .",
    "as explained in section 4 we selected two samples : the f814w - selected one should trace the global features of the hdf - s sample and the f300w - selected sample evidencing star - forming galaxies at moderate @xmath79 .",
    "the f814w - selected catalogue has by far the biggest number of sources , so that the number of galaxies with lower limits in the other bands is rather high .",
    "we applied a linear fit to the color - magnitude relation by making use of `` survival analysis '' ( avni et al .",
    "1980 , isobe et al . 1986 ) , in order to avoid uncertainties introduced by the heavy influence of censored data .",
    "we applied a linear regression based on kaplan - meier residuals .",
    "this analysis has suggested an almost flat relation for ( f450w@xmath71f814w)@xmath0  vs  f814w@xmath0 , ( f450w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0  vs  f814w@xmath0 and  ( f606w@xmath71f814w)@xmath0 vs  f814w@xmath0 for  f814w@xmath80 , while ( f300w@xmath71f450w)@xmath0  vs  f814w@xmath0 did not reach convergence .",

    "this trend may suggest the presence of a flat spectrum population , whose colors seem to saturate but whose contribution is more and more important at faint magnitudes , as confirmed by the rising fraction of galaxies with ( f450w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 bluer than a typical irregular galaxy . broadly speaking galaxy colors",

    "this value is therefore compatible with the previous hypothesis , that a non negligible fraction of the blue galaxies may have a moderate redshift , contributing with an almost euclidean slope to the counts or with number evolution , with very faint galaxies merging at high redshift .",
    "however we can not rule out the hypothesis that such a steep slope can be due to earlier - type evolving galaxies which move into the blue sample at high redshift .",
    "in such a case the steep counts described by the faint blue sample would not require a significant rate of merging to be justified .    in order to check the low - redshift solution we compared the characteristics of those galaxies to the predictions of a local luminosity function .",
    "the brightest of the very blue sources would have @xmath103 if placed at @xmath104  ( assuming  @xmath105=50 km s@xmath106 mpc@xmath106  and a ( f450w@xmath71f814w)@xmath0=1 ) .    considering the local luminosity function ( lf ) of blue galaxies as estimated by marzke et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , described by @xmath107 and @xmath10819.5 and integrating within @xmath104 and @xmath10918 , the number density found is compatible with all very blue galaxies ( i.e. galaxies with ( f450w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 and ( f606w@xmath71f814w)@xmath0 bluer than a local irregular galaxy ) being at such a low redshift .",
    "the first raw technique used to constrain the redshift of sources suggests that a high fraction of faint galaxy is composed by low redshift ( @xmath99 ) sources , nevertheless the `` high redshift solution '' is not ruled out , since steep counts may be due also to merging and our color analysis is very naive .",
    "we then made our analysis better by means of the photometric redshift technique .",
    "we computed photometric redshifts for the galaxies in the f814w catalogue by means of the public code _",
    "( bolzonella et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the method basically consists in a comparison between the observed magnitudes and the photometry expected from a set of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the efficiency of the method relies on the presence of strong spectral features , in particular the @xmath110   break and the lyman break for galaxies at high redshift . to reduce the uncertainties estimating @xmath111 ,",
    "the set of filters must be able to identify these characteristics , spanning a wide range of wavelength .",
    "the photometric redshift @xmath111 is computed by a @xmath112 minimization , considering the whole set of possibilities with different combinations of the involved parameters .    in this procedure",
    "we decided to use the seds built from the bruzual & charlot s synthetic library ( gissel98 , bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , rather than the observed mean local spectra by cww , because tests on hdf - n indicate a slightly lower dispersion at @xmath98 . in any case , cww spectra",
    "lead to not very different conclusions .",
    "hence , we selected 5 spectral types , characterized by different star formation rates , matching the observed colors of the morphological galaxy sequence ; a subsample of ages allowed by the gissel library is also considered .",
    "moreover , we took into account the possible presence of dust applying the reddening law by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for different values of @xmath113 .",
    "the flux decrement produced by intervening neutral hydrogen is computed following the recipe by madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "only spectra with solar metallicity are considered here , because the metallicity can be regarded as a secondary parameter .    the accuracy of photometric redshift estimate obtained from the considered set of filters can be studied by means of simulations on synthetic catalogue .",
    "some degeneracy can be found ( bolzonella et al . , 2000 ) , with a non negligible part of galaxies lying at @xmath114 ",
    "@xmath115 incorrectly located at low redshift .",
    "these galaxies show frequently a probability function with several comparable peaks , at low and high @xmath79 , due to the degeneracy in the parameter space . near infrared data",
    "can in principle avoid these uncertainties . nonetheless , also with the available",
    "set of filters , we can guess that the objects with @xmath116 really belong to this redshift , because high-@xmath79 objects are rarely misidentified as low-@xmath79 galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts for our catalogue indicate that all very blue galaxies are at @xmath117 ( med(@xmath111)=1.6 ) .",
    "this feature , along with their steep slope ( see section 5 ) , suggests a high merging rate for galaxies at @xmath117 .",
    "vice versa very red sources have a shallower redshift distribution ( med(@xmath111)=0.6 ) , though at f814w@xmath118 most sources have a high redshift .",
    "similarly , at f814w@xmath7425 , late type galaxies have a higher median redshift ( med(@xmath111)=1.1 ) than  early  type  ones ( med(@xmath111)=0.6 )  and the redshift distribution ( figure [ z_histo ] ) is similar to driver et al . (",
    "1998 ) one , though the number of sources at @xmath119 is lower .",
    "there is a point to be emphasized about redshift distributions and morphological types : the detection of galaxies at high redshift is seriously biased against elliptical galaxies because of @xmath97 in the f814w - band . at @xmath120 , early type galaxies have @xmath97 ( @xmath121 mag ) greater than late type @xmath97 , making them fainter .",
    "it means that a cut in apparent magnitude , such as f814w@xmath7425 , biases the sample toward galaxies with lower @xmath97 . to skip this problem",
    ", we tried to select a volume - limited sample , based on our photometric redshifts .",
    "when selecting all galaxies with @xmath122 , we found only 15@xmath37 to be with f814w@xmath7425 , that is with a reliable morphological classification according to our method .",
    "vice versa it means that a cut off in apparent magnitude does not offer a fair sample for a redshift distribution of the different morphological types .",
    "probably also the apparent decrease in early - type galaxies number counts , as shown in figure [ morph_c ] , is due to this bias .",
    "we compared our number counts with different models , by using galaxy counts models by gardner ( 1998 ) .",
    "we adopted a flat cosmological model ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 km s@xmath106 mpc@xmath106 ) in all models .",
    "we used the luminosity function of marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) both considering a single schechter function for all morphological types and three different schechter fits for elliptical , spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "our counts are best fitted by considering three lfs , luminosity evolution and a moderate merging ( figure [ ncmod ] ) consistent with our interpretations .",
    "the merging rate in gardner ( 1998 ) follows rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni ( 1990 ) with number evolution parameterized as @xmath125 in the schechter fit to the lf , and in order to conserve the luminosity density , @xmath126 ; @xmath127 is a free parameter .",
    "good fits to our data are obtained with @xmath128 in the case of three lfs for the cosmological parameters considered .",
    "the hdf - s represents a unique opportunity for the study of  faint  galaxies  up to   now ,  both  for  its  depth ( f814w@xmath129 for detection and f814w@xmath130 for completeness ) and spatial resolution ( fwhm@xmath270.2 arcsec ) .",
    "we presented here colors and number counts of hdf - s galaxies , along with number counts determined by splitting the sample considering the morphology and the colors of the galaxies .",
    "we also analyzed the photometric data to constrain the redshift of hdf - s galaxies , and determine the contribution of different redshift populations to the counts .",
    "the main results are the following :    * the number - counts relation has an increasing slope up to the limits of the survey in all four bands .",
    "the slope is steeper at shortest wavelengths ; * the number counts model which best fits our data is obtained by considering three different schechter functions for elliptical , spiral and irregular galaxies ( marzke et al .",
    "1998 ) , luminosity evolution and a moderate merging ( @xmath131 ) ; * optical colors show that the sample contains a high fraction of galaxies bluer than local sources , for instance at f814w@xmath6 about @xmath5 of sources have ( f450w@xmath71f606w)@xmath0 bluer than a typical local irregular galaxy ; * after an initial blueing trend the color - magnitude relation gets flat , suggesting a color - saturation due to a strong contribution of a flat spectrum population in the faintest bins ; * morphological number counts ( f814w@xmath132 ) are dominated by late type galaxies ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) , while early type galaxies show a steep decrease in the faintest bin ; * photometric redshifts of our sample galaxies show that the galaxies contributing with a steep slope to the number counts have @xmath135 , suggesting a moderate merging ; * morphological redshift distributions and number counts are biased against elliptical galaxies when using an apparent magnitude cut - off .",
    "our number counts are in good agreement with previous results , except for the f300w - band number counts in the hdf - n .",
    "we do not see a flattening in f300w - band number counts , limiting our analysis at f300w@xmath7426.5 .",
    "a steep f300w - slope may be explained both with a high fraction of low redshift galaxies or with merging or a mixture of them . in the former case ,",
    "intrinsically faint , low redshift galaxies , imply a steep faint end slope of the lf in the f300w - band ( @xmath136 ) in the latter case we emphasize that if merging is the reason of the steep f300w - band counts , it would take place at @xmath98 since the lyman break prevents us from detecting galaxies in the f300w - band at higher redshift",
    ". a way of detecting merging and hence to check the validity of the hierarchical model , could be in principle the study of the evolution with look - back time of some structural parameters of galaxies , such as their intrinsic size .",
    "morphological number counts are in agreement with previous results , as well as the morphological redshift distributions .",
    "the morphological classification is , however , possible only for bright galaxies .",
    "the cut in apparent magnitude biases the sample against early - type galaxies , due to their large @xmath97 . a correct test implying morphological classification should be done using k - band data ( an extension of the test proposed by kauffmann & charlot , 1998 ) or a volume - limited sample , with morphology determined from spectra .",
    "extracting a volume - limited sample from a magnitude limited survey does not fit the goal since at @xmath137 almost 80@xmath37 of the galaxies are too faint for a reliable morphological classification from imaging .",
