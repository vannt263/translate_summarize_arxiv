    "the well known exact solution of the coupled maxwell - einstein equations outside the spherically - symmetric matter distribution is the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "the analytic extension of the reissner - nordstrm metric has rather exotic properties .",
    "the black hole s interior contains cauchy horizons , time - like singularities and tunnels to other asymptotically flat regions .",
    "recently , it has been shown both in perturbative analysis and by solving the full non - linear problem that a cauchy horizon inside a charged black hole is transformed into a null , weak singularity @xcite .",
    "the cauchy horizon singularity is weak in the sense that an infalling observer crossing it experiences only a finite tidal deformation @xcite .",
    "however , the curvature scalars diverge along the cauchy horizon , leading to an unbound growth of the internal mass - parameter , a phenomena known as the mass - inflation @xcite .",
    "the earlier studies were done on the pre - existing ( eternal ) reissner - nordstrm space - time .",
    "hod and piran @xcite , have demonstrated explicitly that mass - inflation takes place also during a dynamical charged gravitational collapse .",
    "the dynamical space - time is drastically different from the analytically extended reissner - nordstrm manifold : it resembles more the schwarzschild one .",
    "the penrose diagrams of the various space - times are depicted on figure [ fig : penrose ] .     and @xmath1 are , respectively , the schwarzschild and the reissner - nordstrm eternal ( pre - existing ) spacetimes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are ones expected to form during a dynamical collapse of a neutral and a charged matter , respectively . the actual , dynamically calculated , space - time geometry for a charged gravitational collapse , @xmath4 is dramatically different from that depicted on @xmath3 and it resembles ( in broad terms ) the schwarzschild space - time . in all the figures",
    "thick solid lines represent central singularities ( space - like for the schwarzschild manifold or time - like for the reissner - nordstrm one ) . the weak , null singularity in figure @xmath4",
    "is represented as a thick dashed line , while thin dashed lines describe various horizons.,width=377 ]    this is so far the classical picture .",
    "our goal , here , is to consider quantum effects and to investigate the influence of pair creation in strong electric fields on charged gravitational collapse . specifically , we are interested in the effects of pair creation on the inner structure of the black hole that forms in such a collapse .",
    "this goal differs from previous works on the subject .",
    "pair creation was mainly considered in the external region of a pre - existing black hole s space - time , outside the event horizon @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the produced particles rapidly diminish the charge of a black hole as seen by an external observer .",
    "particles creation takes place , however , also in the inner region of a black hole .",
    "novikov & starobinski @xcite and herman & hiscock @xcite studied the inner geometry and the stability of a cauchy horizon in the pre - existing reissner - nordstrm space - time influenced by the pair creation effect .",
    "the model in ref .",
    "@xcite assumes the instantaneous disappearance of the electric field , when the pair creation takes place inside the event horizon along @xmath5 hypersurface .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm patch of the space - time exterior to this hypersurface is glued along the @xmath5 hypersurface to an interior schwarzschild patch . in this model",
    "the cauchy horizon does not exist .",
    "the model in ref .",
    "@xcite assumes an initially reissner - nordstrm geometry and allows the evolution of the electric field through the back - reaction of the created pairs . in this model",
    "the initial reissner - nordstrm geometry evolves to an uncharged , schwarzschild - like one - the cauchy horizon is shown to be unstable with respect to the process of pair creation .",
    "it should be emphasized that in this model the cauchy horizon is assumed to be stationary @xmath6 hypersurface .",
    "this is in contrast to the recent investigations @xcite , where the cauchy horizon was shown to be non static , contracting null hypersurface .",
    "although , the particle production in the intensive electric field is the simplest quantum process , its influence on the inner structure of black holes was not studied yet in an evolutionary context .",
    "the effect of pair creation in the intensive electric field is probably most important , when dealing with a formation of the inner structure of a charged black holes .",
    "this depends , of course , on the parameters of the formed black hole . in this work",
    "we take a different point of view from @xcite and explore the dynamical picture i.e. , we replace the question is the cauchy horizon stable , with the question does it form at all . to address this question , one should consider the collapse of a charged self - gravitating matter .",
    "the electron - positron pairs are produced in the electric field of the collapsing matter . to treat consistently the problem of such a collapse",
    ", one should take into account the back - reaction of the produced pairs on the source s electric field .",
    "this is achieved by adding the electric current due to the produced pairs as a source to the maxwell equations : @xmath7 the charge conservation equation in the situation with pair creation is modified by adding the charge source : @xmath8 the stress - energy of the electric current of the produced particles arises from the stress - energy of the electric field .",
    "the latter is the source of the pairs , by means of the energy - momentum conservation .    to formulate the problem",
    "properly we need a back - reaction formalism that includes the back reaction of the pairs on the stress energy tensor of the electric field that create them . without this",
    "the problem would not be self consistent .",
    "such a formalism is not available .",
    "instead we consider here a toy model that utilizes the main physical properties of the system - the fact that the pairs limit the electric field to a critical value , @xmath0 .",
    "we describe this effect of pair creation by introducing a nonlinear dielectric constant which prevents the electric field from exceeding @xmath0 , the critical pair creating field . in doing",
    "so we have ignored the electric current of the pairs and their stress - energy .",
    "we also disregard the contribution from vacuum polarization , which becomes significant only for the exponentially large fields @xcite . in spite of this simplifying assumptions we believe that this model captures the characteristic behavior of the real system .",
    "in section [ motiv ] we consider discharge in a classical space - time and give the motivation of the investigation of the influence of the pair creation on the inner structure of charged black holes . in section [ model ]",
    "we present the underling physical model .",
    "we develop the formalism and discuss the applicability of the model .",
    "section [ numerics ] describes our numerical scheme .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we compare a classical charged gravitational dynamical collapse with a collapse with the discharge .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ summary ] .",
    "we use units in which @xmath9 .",
    "when pairs are created in an asymptotically flat region one of the particles , having the same charge as the field s source , is repulsed from the body and escape to infinity .",
    "the another member of the pair is attracted to the body , decreasing its charge .",
    "this occurs , for example , to pairs created in the field of a charged black hole , outside its event horizon .",
    "the black hole discharges rather quickly , until its external field becomes subcritical @xcite .",
    "a more interesting situation occurs when a significant pair creation takes place within the event horizon of a charged black hole .",
    "the newborn particles do not have a spatial infinity to escape to , they are trapped within the event horizon . in the reissner - nordstrm manifold in the region between the outer and the inner horizons the area",
    "coordinate @xmath10 and the time change their roles .",
    "the vector @xmath11 is now timelike , while the vector @xmath12 is spacelike .",
    "the only non - vanishing components of the electromagnetic tensor are @xmath13 and only @xmath14 are nonzero .",
    "an infalling observer moving along @xmath15 world - line , in the region between the horizons , will experience a spatially homogeneous electric field , increasing in strength into the future ( the @xmath10-coordinate decreases ) .",
    "the electric field has only a @xmath16-component : @xmath17 , wherein the bold face denotes usual 3-vectors .",
    "the direction of the field lines in a regular reissner - nordstrm space - time is from one singularity to the other ( see figure [ fig : qed ] ) .",
    "the maximally extended reissner - nordstrm space - time has a charge asymmetry in the sense that two external observers in the two past asymptotically flat regions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , see the black hole charged oppositely .",
    "the left - hand and the right - hand singularities seem to such observers to have opposite charges .     along the surface @xmath20 .",
    "oppositely charged particles are accelerated in opposite directions , leading to the redistribution of the charge bellow the event horizon and to a change of the inner geometry of the charged black hole.,width=377 ]    in the interior of a classical charged black hole , between the inner and the outer horuzons , pairs of charged particles are produced by the electric field along @xmath21 surfaces .",
    "an oppositely charged particles are accelerated in the opposite @xmath22 directions .",
    "thus , if the black hole has a negative charge the positively charged particles will be attracted to it , accelerating toward the left - hand singularity , while the negatively charged particles will be repulsed from this singularity , accelerating toward the right - hand one ( see figure [ fig : qed ] ) .",
    "this leads to the redistribution of the charge , which was initially concentrated near the left - hand singularity . at the end of this process , in the perfectly symmetric situation , when the charge is equally divided among the left - hand and the right - hand singularities the electric field disappears .",
    "but the whole exotic structure of the inner part of the analytically extended reissner - nordstrm manifold is due to the existence of this electric field .",
    "therefore , vanishing of the electric field leads to the disappearance of the tunnels to other asymptotically flat regions .",
    "we will show here that a similar redistribution of the charge takes place also in a dynamical space - time , leading , as we shall see , to the partial closure of the `` space tunnels '' .",
    "in this section we develop an evolutionary formulation which includes the effect of pair creation in strong electric fields .",
    "we present bellow a simplified toy model , describing this effect for a dynamical space - time in which a black hole forms .",
    "the first study of charged particles production in an uniform electric field was undertaken by j.schwinger in 1951 .",
    "the schwinger s formula for the number of scalar pairs created by the field @xmath23 per unit four - volume is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mass and the charge of a created particle and the _ critical electric field _ , @xmath0 ,",
    "is defined as : @xmath27 the production rate of fermions differs from ( [ schwingerrate ] ) by an overall factor @xmath28 and by the absence of the sign interchange @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of the vacuum polarization ( the change of the vacuum electric permittivity ) in strong electric fields is instantaneously stronger than the contribution from a pair production ( by @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) , but the latter can accumulate with the time @xcite .",
    "the integrated contribution from the pair creation can dominate the contribution from the vacuum polarization .",
    "our model utilizes the essential property of the schwinger s result ( [ schwingerrate ] ) - the exponential dependence on the ratio @xmath32 , which means that pair creation rate is exponentially large for a supercritical field and the rate is exponentially suppressed for a subcritical field .",
    "this dependence suggests that once the field rises above @xmath0 , charged pairs are produced intensively , reducing the field down to the critical value .",
    "we neglect @xmath33 the net electric current of the pairs and @xmath34 the stress - energy of the produced particles , assuming that the role of the electric current is confined to prevent the electric field from rising above the critical value .",
    "hence , the electric field will be taken as : @xmath35 the @xmath36 stands for the ordinary electric field which would have arised in the absence of pair creation .    in this case",
    "we can mimic the effect of particles production as if the system was placed in a dielectric medium .",
    "effectively , the polarization of this medium prevents the electric field @xmath23 from rising above @xmath0 , while the _ electric displacement _ , @xmath37 , changes . the scalar quantity @xmath38 is the _",
    "dielectric constant_. the electric displacement is related to the density of a free charge via the maxwell equation : @xmath39 the dielectric `` constant '' that leads to ( [ modelfield ] ) is given by : @xmath40    the local description of the classical theory of electromagnetism in a curved space - time in a dielectric media can be derived from an effective local lagrangian : @xmath41 we use this lagrangian with @xmath42 given by ( [ def_eps ] ) to describe the effects of pair creation in the strong electric field .",
    "our toy model captures the essence of the physics , particularly the fast reduction of the supercritical field down to the critical value , @xmath0 and the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the dielectric `` constant '' that we introduce has the same effect as the pairs which `` shorten '' an electric field above @xmath43 .",
    "however , we ignore all other features of the pairs , specifically we ignore the pairs themselves , their energy momentum tensor ( which is replaced by a modified electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor that arises from the dielectric constant ) and their electric current .",
    "this is done in order to obtain a simple self consistent energy conserving system .",
    "it is difficult to estimate what would be the effect of the electric current of the pairs . on the other hand",
    "it is clear that the stress - energy of the pairs would make a positive contribution to the mass - parameter ( [ massfunc ] ) and will make the effects , which we describe latter , more pronounced .",
    "another artificial feature of our model is the ad hoc introduction of @xmath43 .",
    "this critical field is associated with the mass of the charged particles ( see eq .",
    "( [ criticalfield ] ) )",
    ". however , for simplicity our model is based on a massless charged scalar field , whose characteristics are along null geodesics .",
    "for such a massless field the critical electric field vanishes and charged massless pairs are produced even for an infinitely small electric field .",
    "we introduce a critical field @xmath0 as a _ free parameter _ which can be used to define the mass of the created particles trough the relation ( [ criticalfield ] ) .",
    "in addition to the above properties there are other minor and physically justified assumptions : first , our toy model ignores the contribution from vacuum polarization due to the intensive electric field ( to be distinguished from the effective polarization , which we describe here ) .",
    "this would be justified if the effect of the vacuum polarization is small compared to the pair creation contribution .",
    "this is in fact the situation when the electric field is not exponentially large @xcite .",
    "second , when constructing our model , we have utilized schwinger s result ( [ schwingerrate ] ) , more precisely , its exponential dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "schwinger s formula is valid , strictly speaking , only for an uniform and static electric field over a flat space - time background .",
    "the approximation of flat - space is valid if the radius of curvature of the dynamical geometry is much greater than the compton wavelength of a created particles .",
    "the radius of a curvature can be taken of order @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "the compton wavelength of the particles is @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the condition for a flat - space approximation , @xmath47 , takes the form @xmath48 but , the ricci scalar @xmath45 has been shown , in dynamical models , to diverge approaching the cauchy horizon , ( this is the mass inflation scenario ) thus , the approximation breaks down in vicinity of the singular cauchy horizon .",
    "notwithstanding , our model is , actually , not based on exact schwinger result , but on its exponential dependence on @xmath32 which is non - perturbative .",
    "anyway , all approximations will be broken at some moment .",
    "eventually , the curvature in the vicinity of the singular cauchy horizon  becomes planckian since the `` coulomb component '' of the weyl curvature diverges exponentially with advanced time ( for a spherical symmetry- @xmath49 , with @xmath25 the internal mass parameter .",
    ") moreover , the ricci curvature may dominate the weyl curvature and surpass the planck values even earlier . in either case",
    "our analysis becomes meaningless , and a theory of quantum gravity is needed .",
    "we obviously consider only the sub - planckian regions .      our goal is to integrate numerically the evolution equations and to follow the collapse of a spherically symmetric regular initial scalar field distribution via the formation of an apparent horizon and a cauchy horizon , toward a central singularity .",
    "the conventional choice of coordinates for this dynamical evolution is double - null coordinates . in these coordinates : @xmath50 the apparent horizon ( when it forms ) is regular i.e. it is free from unphysical coordinate singularities ; @xmath51 for a massless scalar field the characteristics are null so this choice is `` natural '' for models involving massless scalar fields .",
    "we choose the line element of the form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unit two - sphere .",
    "there is a coordinate gauge freedom : the choice of coordinates @xmath54 is unique only up to a change of variables @xmath55 , which leave the line element ( [ metric ] ) unchanged . for the time being we do not specify our double - null coordinates : these are just general ingoing and outgoing null coordinates .",
    "later , when discussing the numerical integration we will fix the gauge freedom and specify the coordinates .    let the @xmath56 be the electromagnetic tensor , defined as @xmath57}$ ] .",
    "in a spherically symmetric space - time the only non vanishing field components are : @xmath13 .",
    "thus , only @xmath58 and @xmath59 need be non vanishing . then @xmath60 can be removed by the gauge transformation @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "we are left with @xmath63 and we denote : @xmath64 .",
    "we reformulate the set of coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations as a first order system .",
    "the numerical integration of the first order system functions very well both for the uncharged case , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the charged situation @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define the auxiliary variables : @xmath65 wherein @xmath66 is the complex massless scalar field .",
    "we have adopted the notation @xmath67 for partial derivatives of any function @xmath68 .",
    "we denote by @xmath69 the free charge i.e. the charge of the collapsing scalar field , and by @xmath70 the total charge up to the sphere of radius @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is the charge defined by the qed effects .",
    "the scalar field is collapsing under the influence of the total charge @xmath70 not the free charge @xmath71 . in a local inertial frame : @xmath72 and we define : @xmath73 .",
    "we write the closed system of equations for the qed - corrected situation :    einstein equations : @xmath74 maxwell equations : @xmath75 the scalar field equations : @xmath76 and , finally , the definitions ( [ newvar ] ) : @xmath77 the qed - corrected equations are reduced to the classical ones @xcite by setting @xmath78 .",
    "the system of evolutionary equations have to be completed by a specification of the initial and the boundary data along some characteristic hypersurface . for models involving massless fields the characteristics are null segments .",
    "thus , it is natural to specify the initial conditions and the boundary conditions along null hypersurfaces . a satisfactory , for an uncharged case , formulation of the initial - value problem has been given by burko & ori @xcite . the generalization for a charged case",
    "is given bellow .",
    "we choose the initial characteristic surfaces to be : the ingoing @xmath79 hypersurface , and , the outgoing @xmath80 hypersurface .",
    "if the domain of integration includes the origin of coordinates it leads to the necessity of a series expansion of physical quantities in powers of the proper distance from the origin , in a vicinity of @xmath81 .",
    "we are , however , interested in the formation of the cauchy horizon .",
    "we can , therefore , exclude the origin @xmath81 from the domain of integration .",
    "we achieve this by an appropriate choice of the final outgoing segment @xmath82 , so the domain of integration does not include the origin .",
    "now we can remove the coordinates freedom .",
    "to do so , we fix the `` linear '' gauge , i.e. we take @xmath10 to be linear with @xmath83 or @xmath84 along the characteristic hypersurfaces .",
    "namely , on @xmath85 segment we choose @xmath86 , on @xmath87 segment we choose @xmath88 . to get @xmath10 along initial surfaces",
    "it is necessary to supply @xmath89 that serves as a free parameter .",
    "the conventional choice for a characteristic segments @xmath90 , @xmath91 , yields : @xmath92     a schematic diagram of the integrated space - time.,width=302 ]    now we specify freely the scalar field distribution along the initial segments .",
    "we choose a compact ingoing scalar field pulse along the ingoing @xmath93 segment ; and the `` no - perturbation '' along the initial outgoing @xmath94 segment . specifically , we take",
    "@xmath95 that corresponds to a fixed static background for @xmath96 .",
    "and we choose @xmath97 except at some finite region @xmath98 .",
    "to be concrete , for a complex scalar field @xmath66 , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 two real scalar fields , we choose : @xmath101 where @xmath102 are constant amplitudes , and @xmath103 are the end - points of each of the real - fields pulses , and @xmath104 is their common starting - point .",
    "this choice of the initial data is differentiable at the matching points @xmath105 .",
    "the integrated space - time is schematically depicted on figure [ fig : domain ] .    from ( [ psi ] )",
    "we obtain the initial values of @xmath106 , and @xmath107 : @xmath108 from the constraint equations e2-e3 and the definition d1 , together with the choice @xmath109 one determines the initial values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 @xmath113 we assume the minkowski space - time for @xmath96 , therefore , we set @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    in our coordinates the mass - function ( the mass - parameter ) becomes : @xmath116 since the mass - function vanishes for the flat space - time ( in the region @xmath96 ) , one can calculate : @xmath117 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath118 our ingoing null coordinate @xmath119 is closely related ( proportional ) to the ingoing eddington - finkelstein null coordinate @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath83 coordinate is related to the proper time of an observer at the origin .",
    "this is defined as @xcite : @xmath121 in our choice the space - time to the left to the @xmath94 characteristic hypersurface is minkowskian until the very last moments of the collapse .",
    "hence , @xmath122 except the section when @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the integration in ( [ propert ] ) is trivial and yields : @xmath125",
    ". later , we will find it useful to utilize the proper time of an observer at the origin as a measure of the `` length '' of the cauchy horizon .",
    "we have converted the second order equations to first order equations .",
    "our numerical scheme is based on a simultaneous integration of this first order system of coupled differential equations .",
    "we solve numerically equations @xmath126 .",
    "we set @xmath127 to obtain the classical collapse with no pair creation .",

    "the algorithm for the numerical integration in the classical case ( @xmath127 ) is described in @xcite . here",
    "we generalize this algorithm to the case when pair creation is included .    at each step",
    "we evolve @xmath110 and @xmath106 using @xmath128 and @xmath129 from the hypersurface @xmath83 to @xmath130",
    ". then we solve the appropriate equations for the rest of quantities along the outgoing null rays @xmath131 , starting from the initial outgoing hypersurface @xmath94 .",
    "we integrate equation @xmath132 to find @xmath111 , then we solve the coupled differential equations @xmath133 and @xmath134 to get @xmath10 and @xmath135 .",
    "next , the equations @xmath136 are integrated to obtain @xmath137 , @xmath71 and @xmath138 . finally , the differential equations @xmath139 and @xmath140 are solved for @xmath141 and @xmath107 , respectively . after each step in the @xmath83-direction we calculate the electric field strength , @xmath142 , along the current outgoing null ray ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "we use this field value to establish the value of @xmath42 , according to ( [ def_eps ] ) , for the next @xmath83-step .",
    "this integration scheme uses three distinct methods to evolve the initial data .",
    "all these methods are well known and commonly used ( see , for example , the recipes - book by press w.h . , et al .",

    "more precisely , as it seen by an infalling observer , the formation of the cauchy horizon occurs on the planck scale .",

    ". @xcite . between two extremes",

    "one does not expect , in general , a significant excess of charge .",

    "a more generic phenomena of a collapse is one endowed by an angular momentum .",
    "this is an axisymmetric process and it is rather difficult to study , both analytically and numerically . the common property of a charged spherically symmetric collapse and the general axisymmetric one is an existence of cauchy horizons inside the black hole .",
    "hence , we use the charged collapse as a toy model to simulate the more general rotating situation and to derive a conclusions about the inner structure of the spinning black holes .",
    "it would be interesting question to apply the considerations of this work to a local production of particles below the event horizon of a rotating black hole .",
    "outside the event horizon of a rotating black hole the coupling of the black hole s spin to the orbital angular momentum of particles leads to the phenomena of superradiance .",
