    "lattice gauge theory offers the possibility to perform non - perturbative computations in a strongly coupled theory without any model assumptions .",
    "lattice qcd , in particular , allows us to investigate low - energy properties of qcd , like , e.g. , the hadron mass spectrum , decay constants , form factors , and moments of structure functions . in this article",
    ", we shall discuss as an example the computation of four - quark operators in the nucleon recently performed by our group ( the qcdsf collaboration ) . since",
    "four - quark operators are related to higher - twist effects in nucleon structure functions , a subject of considerable theoretical and experimental importance , they are a particularly interesting object for lattice - qcd studies . for more technical details",
    "we refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "the basic observables in lattice qcd are euclidean @xmath0-point correlation functions .",
    "since space - time has been discretised ( with lattice spacing @xmath1 ) the path integral has become a high - dimensional ordinary integral over a discrete set of field variables , which can be evaluated by monte carlo methods . as the ( grassmann valued )",
    "quark fields appear bilinearly in the action , they can be integrated out analytically leaving behind the determinant of the lattice dirac operator and products of quark propagators . in the quenched approximation , which will be employed throughout the whole paper , this determinant",
    "is replaced by 1 .",
    "the quenched approximation saves a lot of computer time , but it is hardly possible to estimate its accuracy .",
    "let us briefly sketch the computation of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "first , one has to choose suitable interpolating fields for the particle to be studied . for a proton with momentum @xmath2 one may take @xmath3 and the corresponding @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 ,  are colour indices and @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  are dirac indices .",
    "as the time extent @xmath9 of our lattice tends to @xmath10 , the two - point correlation function becomes the vacuum expectation value of the corresponding hilbert space operators with the euclidean evolution operator @xmath11 in between , i.e.  we have , omitting dirac indices and momenta for simplicity : @xmath12 if in addition the time @xmath13 gets large , the ground state @xmath14 of the proton will dominate the sum over intermediate states between @xmath15 and @xmath4 , and the two - point function will decay exponentially with a decay rate given by the proton energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 of course , if the momentum vanishes , we have @xmath18 , the proton mass .",
    "similarly we have for a three - point function with the operator @xmath19 whose matrix elements we want to calculate : @xmath20",
    "if @xmath21 . hence the ratio @xmath22 should be independent of the times @xmath23 and @xmath13 , if all time differences are so large that excited states can be neglected .",
    "the proton three - point function for a two - quark operator contains quark - line connected as well as quark - line disconnected pieces . in the quark - line connected contributions",
    "the operator is inserted in one of the quark lines of the nucleon propagator , while in the disconnected pieces the operator is attached to an additional closed quark line which communicates with the valence quarks in the proton only via gluon exchange . in the limit of exact isospin invariance as it is considered in this paper , the disconnected contributions cancel in the case of non - singlet two - quark operators .",
    "moreover , one might try to argue that it would be more consistent with the quenched approximation to drop quark - line disconnected contributions generally .",
    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) relates moments of structure functions to nucleon matrix elements of local operators . in the deep - inelastic limit , where the momentum transfer @xmath24 becomes large",
    ", one can express nachtmann moments of , e.g. , @xmath25 in the following form : @xmath26 here @xmath27 , the ( reduced ) matrix elements @xmath28 of twist @xmath13 and spin @xmath0 are renormalised at the scale @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the wilson coefficients , calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "note that we go back to minkowski space in this section .",
    "besides the leading twist-2 contribution we have included in ( [ nachtmann ] ) the twist-4 corrections .",
    "these are suppressed by @xmath31 and have been the subject of intensive investigations both experimentally and theoretically . in the following",
    "we shall describe what lattice computations can tell us about twist-4 effects .",
    "an important class of twist-4 operators consists of four - quark operators .",
    "in particular , the twist-4 , spin-2 matrix element @xmath32 is defined by the following expectation value in a proton state with 4-momentum @xmath33 ( @xmath34 indicates symmetrisation ) @xmath35 with the four - quark operator @xmath36 here the quark field @xmath37 carries flavour , colour , and dirac indices , the @xmath38 are the usual generators of colour su(3 ) , and @xmath39 is a matrix in flavour space , the charge matrix @xmath40    the corresponding leading - twist matrix element @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 in terms of the two - quark operator @xmath43{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\nu}$ } } \\psi \\ , .",
    "\\label{2qop}\\ ] ] this operator has dimension 4 , while the four - quark operator ( [ 4qop ] ) has dimension 6 . hence four - quark operators may mix with operators of lower dimension ( two - quark operators ) .",
    "this is a rather general phenomenon for operators of higher twist , because for given spin , higher twist means higher dimension .",
    "unfortunately , the mixing with operators of lower dimension is hard to deal with in perturbation theory . for the time being we do not attempt a non - perturbative calculation of the renormalisation and mixing coefficients .",
    "instead we look for four - quark operators for which mixing with two - quark operators is prohibited by flavour symmetry and apply perturbative ( one - loop ) renormalisation .",
    "assuming su(2 ) flavour symmetry ( isospin symmetry ) we find that two - quark operators can have isospin @xmath44 or 1 , whereas four - quark operators can have @xmath44 , 1 , or 2 . hence",
    "four - quark operators with @xmath45 can not mix with two - quark operators .",
    "unfortunately , the expectation value of any @xmath45 operator in the proton vanishes .",
    "so we have to enlarge the flavour symmetry from su(2)@xmath46 to su(3)@xmath46 , i.e.  we assume three quarks of the same mass , and the flavour structure of the operator in the ope is now @xmath47 whereas two - quark operators transform under su(3)@xmath46 according to @xmath48 , we have for four - quark operators : @xmath49 .",
    "four - quark operators with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and hypercharge @xmath52 from the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 multiplets do not mix with two - quark operators and can be used in a proton expectation value , e.g.  the @xmath56 operator @xmath57\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] belongs to the @xmath55 multiplet . such a flavour component can be projected out by suitable linear combinations of the matrix elements of the octet baryons @xmath58 , @xmath0 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , e.g. @xmath62 note that the flavour combination in four - quark operators which do not mix with two - quark operators ( like @xmath63 ) is such that all quark - line disconnected contributions cancel . however , mixing with other four - quark operators ( with different dirac or colour structures ) remains and is taken into account using perturbatively calculated mixing coefficients .    after a chiral extrapolation ( linear in the quark mass ) we obtain in our special flavour channel @xmath64 the @xmath65 contribution arises from the fact that we know only the tree level wilson coefficient @xmath66 @xcite . for reasonable values of @xmath24",
    "the result is rather small using , e.g. , @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "but it is interesting to note that the bag model estimates the prefactor in ( [ result ] ) to be @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the bag constant @xcite .",
    "the four - quark operators can be rewritten to look like diquark densities .",
    "we have computed matrix elements of operators of the following form : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath1 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are colour indices .",
    "the dirac structure of the operators is represented by the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in ( [ diq3 ] )",
    "the diquark is in a @xmath78 of colour and thus anti - symmetric in the colour indices . in ( [ diq6 ] )",
    "it is in a @xmath79 and symmetric in the colour indices . strictly speaking",
    ", we are again studying operators from the * 27 * representation of su(3)@xmath46 whose @xmath80 component is as given above .",
    "but at least within the quenched approximation the interpretation as valence diquark densities seems reasonable . in order to interpret our results we have combined the operators such that they correspond to diquarks of spin zero and spin one . for an operator @xmath81 with two space - time indices ( in euclidean notation ) , e.g.  for the dirac structure @xmath82 , we take the expectation value of @xmath83 in a state with vanishing momentum to represent a spin - zero diquark and the expectation value of @xmath84 to correspond to a spin - one diquark .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.dq ] we show our results for the diquark densities .",
    "they are plotted versus @xmath85 and linearly extrapolated to the chiral limit at @xmath86 , where the variable @xmath85 determines the bare quark mass @xmath87 . in physical units",
    "these bare quark masses are approximately 100 , 190 , and 250 mev .",
    "the pattern of the results can tentatively be understood in a non - relativistic quark picture .",
    "when the diquark is in the @xmath88 of su(3)@xmath89 it is anti - symmetric in the colour indices , and therefore the symmetric ( in the spin indices ) spin - one state is favoured over the anti - symmetric spin - zero state . on the other hand ,",
    "when the diquark is in the ( symmetric ) @xmath90 of colour one might at first sight expect the anti - symmetric spin - zero state to dominate over the symmetric spin - one state .",
    "although the spin - zero contribution is indeed less suppressed than in the @xmath88 case it is not really dominating .",
    "this is probably related to the fact that a diquark in the @xmath90 of su(3)@xmath89 must be accompanied by ( at least ) one gluon if it is to form a colour singlet with the remaining quark .",
    "the coupling to the gluon , mixing `` large '' and `` small '' components of the quark spinors , would invalidate the above arguments which worked reasonably well for diquarks in the @xmath88 of colour .",
    "this work is supported by the dfg ( schwerpunkt `` elektromagnetische sonden '' ) and by bmbf .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the quadrics computers at desy zeuthen .",
