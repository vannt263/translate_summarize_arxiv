    "type ia supernovae are highly luminous stellar explosions , visible over cosmological distances .",
    "the chemically enriched ejecta from supernova explosions are important to galactic evolution , and may also play a role in the enrichment of the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "the correlation between peak brightness and exponential fall - off time of the light - curves of type ia supernovae ( @xcite ) means that they can be used as standardisable cosmological candles to measure the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , the progenitor systems giving rise to these supernovae remain poorly understood , despite decades of studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the consensus is that the exploding objects are carbon - oxygen white dwarfs near the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath01.38 m@xmath1 ) that undergo thermonuclear runaways when the density and pressure in their cores reach values where carbon and oxygen will be processed unstably into radioactive iron - group elements .",
    "the resulting explosions completely destroy the white dwarfs , and the subsequent decay of mainly radioactive @xmath8ni in the ejecta powers exponential light - curves which , for a period of weeks to months may outshine the integrated luminosity of the host galaxies .",
    "however , it remains unclear how a carbon - oxygen white dwarf may reach the chandraskhar mass .",
    "carbon - oxygen white dwarfs are usually formed at masses significantly lower than that required for thermonuclear runaway , and since there is no known way in which a single white dwarf may grow in mass a binary origin of type ia supernova progenitors is usually assumed .",
    "two general classes of progenitor scenarios are commonly considered : the single - degenerate and double - degenerate scenarios . in the former , a white dwarf accretes hydrogen - rich material from a non - degenerate companion , and this material",
    "is then processed into carbon and oxygen via thermonuclear burning on the surface of the accretor @xcite . in the dd scenario ,",
    "a binary system goes through two separate white dwarf formation events ( or  in rare cases  a single event in which both components become white dwarfs simultaneously , see @xcite ) , after which the binary loses angular momentum , until the two components merge to form a single white dwarf with a mass at or above that required for a type ia supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "both scenarios have been studied intensely , but due to the relative scarcity of type ia supernova events in nearby galaxies direct observational evidence is lacking .",
    "one promising way to distinguish between progenitor scenarios is by x - ray observations .",
    "the reason is that the thermonuclear burning of hydrogen - rich material on the surface of the white dwarf in the single - degenerate scenario is expected to be highly luminous in supersoft x - rays .",
    "this would mean that single - degenerate progenitors are so - called supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) , characterised by near - eddington luminosities ( @xmath9 erg / s ) and low effective temperatures ( @xmath10 30 - 150 ev ) @xcite .",
    "this sss state of a single - degenerate progenitor would presumably persist up to the point where the accreting white dwarf explodes as a type ia supernovae .",
    "on the other hand , dd progenitors are not expected to be ssss @xcite .",
    "if pre - explosion observations of the positions of known type ia supernovae can be obtained it may therefore be possible to establish if the progenitors are single - degenerate , accreting systems . as a consequence , a systematic search of the _ chandra _",
    "data archive is being undertaken , see @xcite , but so far , no unambiguous direct detections of supersoft x - ray emissions from type ia supernova progenitors have been found .",
    "moreover , the number of observed ssss and the integrated soft x - ray luminosity of gas - poor galaxies both fall one to two orders of magnitude short of accounting for the expected number of massive , accreting white dwarfs , provided the single - degenerate scenario is the dominant contributor to the type ia supernova rate @xcite .",
    "this constraint also holds if single - degenerate progenitors radiate at lower temperatures than that typical of most ssss @xcite .    on january 22 2014",
    ", the discovery of a new supernova ( initially designated psn_j09554214 + 6940260 ) in m82 was announced and categorised as a young type ia @xcite .",
    "shortly afterwards , it was re - designated sn2014j , and the exact position was given as 09:55:42.121,+69:40:25.88 @xcite . at a distance of @xmath03.5 mpc @xcite , this is the closest type ia supernova since sn1972e more than 40 years ago .",
    "since then , a number of sensitive satellite x - ray telescopes have been in operation , including _",
    "exosat _ , _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra_. as a result , large amounts of archival x - ray data are now available .",
    "the relatively short distance to m82 raised the possibility that sn2014j might yield much - needed , strong observational constraints on the progenitor problem .",
    "as a continuation of the systematic archival search mentioned above , the authors analysed the publicly available pre - explosion _ chandra _ observations of the position of sn2014j to establish if an x - ray source was present . additionally , we analysed the single available post - explosion observation of sn2014j to establish upper limits on the x - ray luminosity of the supernova itself . in section [",
    "sect : data.reduction ] we presents our data analysis , and section [ sect : discussion ] disusses the implications of our results .",
    "section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "this article represents an elaboration on the preliminary results reported by @xcite , see also @xcite",
    "the _ chandra _ data archive contains 22 epochs of publicly available pre - explosion observations covering the position of sn2014j , taken with the ccd imaging spectrometer detectors , acis - i and acis - s .",
    "combined , these epochs amount to 828 ks of observations . in all observations ,",
    "the supernova position is within an off - axis angle of @xmath11 , and for @xmath12 of the observing time within an off - axis angle of @xmath13 .",
    "the observations used in this study are summarised in table [ table : observations ] .",
    "in addition , a post - explosion observation ( observation 16580 , lasting 46.85 ks ) was completed on february 4 , 2014 , shortly after maximum light of sn2014j ( pi r. margutti ) . unlike regular _",
    "observations which usually become public a year after completion of the observation , this data was made public immediately .",
    "the results of their initial analysis have been reported by @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : results_xray_uls_post_sn ]",
    "with the upper limits presented in @xcite the total number of nearby ( @xmath1425 mpc ) type ia supernovae for which pre - explosion _ chandra _ observations are available is now 15 : sn2002cv , sn2003cg , sn2004w , sn2006x , sn2006dd , sn2006mr , sn2007gi , sn2007on , sn2007sr , sn2008fp , sn2011fe , sn2011iv , sn2012cu , sn2012fr and sn2014j .",
    "none of these show strong evidence of supersoft x - ray emissions from progenitors @xcite , although the case of sn2007on is ambiguous @xcite .    for sn2014j ,",
    "our results rule out a naked ( i.e. one that is not obscured by local material ) sss progenitor of @xmath15 erg / s if its effective temperature exceeds 100 ev . therefore ,",
    "if the accreting white dwarf in a single - degenerate type ia supernova progenitor system has a photospheric radius comparable to the near - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf radius , and is free of significant amounts of local obscuring material , then our results firmly rule out such a progenitor for sn2014j .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached for sn2007sr , sn2011fe and sn2012fr , and tentatively also for sn2006dd and sn2006mr ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "these results suggest that in these six objects either the progenitors are not single - degenerate systems , or their effective temperatures immediately before the explosion are lower than expected in the standard single - degenerate scenario .    because of the considerable obscuring neutral hydrogen column , the chandra observations do not provide significant constrains in the lower range of ssss effective temperatures .",
    "the upper limit exceeds @xmath16 erg / s for temperatures below @xmath17 ev .",
    "sn2014j in m82 is the nearest type ia supernova in four decades , and the position of the progenitor system has been observed extensively by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray telescope prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "we examined the totality of pre - explosion observations from the _ chandra _ data archive and found no evidence of an x - ray progenitor for sn2014j .",
    "we calculated upper limits on the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of the progenitor ( tables [ table : results ] , [ table : results_xray_uls ] , fig.[fig : teff_nh ] ) .",
    "our results firmly rule out the progenitor being a single - degenerate system with a photospheric radius comparable to the near - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf radius and mass accretion rate in the range where stable nuclear burning can occur .",
    "this is in agreement with results obtained for several other nearby type ia supernovae with pre - explosion images in the _ chandra _ archive .",
    "due to the presence of a large absorbing column we can not rule out a low temperature supersoft x - ray progenitor with @xmath18 80 ev .",
    "we also examined the one existing _",
    "chandra _ observation made after the supernova explosion , and found no evidence of x - ray emission on the position of the supernova .",
    "we calculated upper limits on the x - ray luminosity of sn2014j ( table [ table : results_xray_uls_post_sn ] ) .",
    "sn2014j is located in the center of a region of enhanced soft diffuse emission , roughly 200 pc across , which appears to be a supernova - inflated bubble around a region of recent star formation .",
    "the short cooling time of the gas , estimated from the x - ray spectral analysis , suggests a relatively young age of the bubble .",
    "if sn2014j is indeed located inside the bubble , it belongs to the prompt population of type ia supernovae , with the delay time of the order of @xmath6 myrs .",
