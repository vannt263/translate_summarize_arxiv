    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) is associated with phase transitions and is therefore not expected at positive temperature in one - dimensional equilibrium systems with short - range interactions . the underlying physical picture behind the absence of 1-d phase transitions , viz .",
    "the unsuppressed creation of islands of the minority phase inside a region of the majority phase ( e.g. in an ising system ) due to thermal noise , is very robust .",
    "so it came as a bit of a surprise that in a quite simple stochastic ( and hence noisy ) lattice model of a driven diffusive system with short - range interactions ssb was observed @xcite .",
    "in this so - called bridge model , two species of particles @xmath5 move in opposite directions with rate 1 and are injected with rate @xmath6 and ejected with rate @xmath7 at the boundary sites .",
    "although the dynamical rules are symmetric with respect to the two species , two phases with non - symmetrical steady states were found in a mean - field approximation . in the symmetry",
    "broken states there is a macroscopic excess amount of one particle species , i.e. , the order parameter @xmath8 measuring the difference of the average particle densities of the two species @xmath5 attains a non - zero value in the thermodynamic limit @xmath9 .",
    "these analytical results were confirmed by monte carlo simulations of finite systems of large size @xmath4 .    in the limit of vanishing ejection rate ( @xmath10 ) the existence of ssb in this model",
    "could be established rigorously @xcite .",
    "it emerged that ( at least in this limit ) the phases of spontaneously broken symmetry are dynamically sustained by a traffic jam effect : the particles of one species pile up at one end of the chain ( because of the small rate of ejection ) and thus prevent the entrance of particles of the other species , until by an exponentially rare fluctuation ( i.e. with a probability exponentially small in system size ) no particles of that species enter for sufficiently long time .",
    "then the traffic jam dissolves , allowing for particles of the other species to take over .",
    "later some other stochastic 1-d lattice gas models exhibiting ssb were discovered @xcite , but the nature of the phase transition in the bridge model has remained obscure @xcite .",
    "there is , in fact , recent numerical evidence suggesting that one of the two symmetry broken phases vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "it would seem natural to attack the problem of ssb from a macroscopic viewpoint by deriving a hydrodynamic description of the lattice gas model under eulerian scaling .",
    "this approach indeed works for vanishing boundary rates @xcite , but fails for the general case due to the lack of a sufficiently general hydrodynamic theory for two - component systems in the presence of boundaries @xcite .",
    "only partial results for some specific infinite multi - component systems are known @xcite .",
    "these and other puzzles make driven diffusive two - component systems a matter of considerable current interest , see @xcite for a review . in @xcite we studied a variation of the bridge model with parallel sublattice update .",
    "the deterministic bulk update scheme simplifies the treatment of particle transport , while stochastic creation / annihilation events occur at the boundaries in a similar fashion as in the original bridge model .",
    "thus  while maintaining noisy dynamics",
    " the complexity of the problem is reduced .",
    "this allowed us to determine the exact phase diagram ( for all values of the boundary rates ) and to elucidate the mechanism that leads from a symmetric particle configuration into a state with broken symmetry .",
    "in this work we make rigorous the main results reported in @xcite , which are complemented by new heuristic results on the transition line .",
    "we also point out that earlier work on a similar single - component system @xcite yields a rigorous asymptotic estimate for the residence time in a symmetry broken quasi - stationary state of the two - component system and we present new results on the phase transition between the symmetric and the symmetry broken phase .    in sec .",

    "3 . in sec .  4 we present simulation data which provide further insight in the relevant time scales of the model .",
    "analytical and simulation results for the phase transition line are given in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .  6 with some brief remarks .",
    "the model considered here is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is an even number .",
    "sites are either empty or occupied by a single particle of either species @xmath11 or @xmath12 , i.e. , the particles are subject to an exclusion interaction and the occupation numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 of each site @xmath15 obey @xmath16 . the dynamics is defined as a parallel sublattice update scheme in two half steps . in the first half - step",
    "the following processes take place : at site @xmath17 it is attempted to create a particle of species @xmath11 with probability @xmath18 $ ] if the site is empty , or to annihilate a particle of species @xmath12 with probability @xmath19 $ ] , provided the site is occupied by such a particle : @xmath20 accordingly , at site @xmath4 a particle of species @xmath12 is created with probability @xmath6 and a particle of species @xmath11 is annihilated with probability @xmath7 : @xmath21 in the bulk , the following hopping processes occur deterministically between sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 : @xmath25 in the second half - step , these deterministic hopping processes take place between sites @xmath26 and @xmath22 with @xmath27 .",
    "note that the dynamics is symmetric with respect to interchange of the two particles species combined with space reflection .",
    "the original bridge model @xcite arises as the continuous - time limit of this model with stochastic hopping and has the same symmetry .       and @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    the stationary phase diagram of the model in terms of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 is presented in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "the boundary lines are not difficult to analyze . along the line @xmath28 there is no injection and the stationary state is the empty lattice ( which is trivially symmetric in @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "for @xmath29 it is easy to verify by direct computation that the product measure with alternating densities @xmath30 , @xmath31 if @xmath15 is odd , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 if @xmath15 is even is invariant .",

    "this is a trivial , absorbing form of ssb with no transition between the two states .",
    "the dynamics reduce to that of the single - species lattice gas studied by one of us earlier @xcite . in the special deterministic point @xmath38",
    "there are three invariant measures arising as limits of the measures described above .",
    "one is the symmetric alternating @xmath39 measure ( @xmath40 ) , the other two are the symmetry - broken measures with only @xmath11 or only @xmath12 particles ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "if one of the species is expelled from the system , the dynamics of the majority species for @xmath57 is identical to the single species asep with parallel sublattice update .",
    "the exact steady state distribution @xmath58 for this system has been characterized in @xcite for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 and all system sizes @xmath4 .",

    "here @xmath72 denotes the expected value over the time evolution of the process with initial distribution @xmath73 .",
    "so if we start the process with an empty lattice ( @xmath74 ) then the expected time to reach a symmetry broken state is not growing faster than @xmath75 with the system size @xmath4 .",
    "[ theo2 ]  * stability of states with broken symmetry * + for @xmath57 we have@xmath76  .",
    "so starting with a symmetry broken state @xmath61 where the @xmath12 particles are expelled from the system , the expected time until the next @xmath12 particle enters grows exponentially with @xmath4 . by symmetry",
    "an analogous statement holds if @xmath11 and @xmath12 particles are interchanged .    since @xmath77 and @xmath58 is stationary for the single species system , @xmath61 is invariant for the two species system for times @xmath78 .",
    "so although @xmath61 and @xmath62 are not stationary for finite @xmath4 , they are exponentially stable by theorem 2 for @xmath57 . together with theorem 1 this provides a proof for spontaneous symmetry breaking in this model in the interior region of the phase diagram .",
    "note that this argument is done without knowing the stationary distribution exactly , which should of course be close to the mixture @xmath79 , corresponding to the usual concept of a phase transition in the context of gibbs measures ( e.g.in an ising system ) .",
    "the proofs are given in section 3 , where the proof of theorem 2 is a straightforward application of the results in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 relies on a simple martingale argument for an interesting amplification mechanism which has been published in @xcite , and will be explained again in the next subsection for self - containedness .",
    "it is assumed that at @xmath80 there are no particles in the system and that @xmath81 .",
    "other symmetric initial conditions with a non - empty lattice can be treated in a similar fashion .",
    "starting from the empty lattice , @xmath11 @xmath82 particles are created at every time step with probability @xmath6 at site @xmath17 @xmath83 .",
    "once injected , particles move deterministically with velocity @xmath84 @xmath85 . therefore , at time @xmath86 the system is in a state where the density of @xmath11 @xmath82 particles is @xmath6 @xmath87 at all even sites and @xmath88 @xmath89 at all odd sites . in this situation",
    "both creation and annihilation of particles are possible",
    ".    however , it turns out that the effect of creation of particles is negligible : since @xmath57 the deterministic hopping with velocity @xmath84 transports on average more @xmath11-particles towards site @xmath4 than can be annihilated there .",
    "this leads to the formation of an @xmath11-particle * jam * at the right boundary , blocking the injection of @xmath12-particles .",
    "an analogous argument holds for the left boundary , which is blocked by a @xmath12-particle jam . in these jams ,",
    "the only source of vacancies is annihilation at the boundaries with probability @xmath7 in the first half - step . in the second half - step",
    "the vacancy moves one site towards the bulk with probability @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in a jam , the density of @xmath11 @xmath82 particles at even ( odd ) sites is 1 , while that at odd ( even ) sites is @xmath90 .",
    "so the only way to create particles in this situation is a complete dissolution of a jam .",
    "but as long as it gains particles from transport through the bulk this is a very rare event since @xmath57 .",
    "we show in lemma [ lemma2 ] ( section 3 ) that the average number of created particles is small and bounded independent of @xmath4 .",
    "so creation of particles in this jammed situation becomes negligible in the limit @xmath9 and will be neglected in the following explanation .",
    "the number of particles in each of the two jams reduces by one in every time step with probability @xmath7 .",
    "since creation of particles is negligible , the influx into the jam ceases after some time and the jam eventually dissolves . by fluctuations ,",
    "one of the jams , say the @xmath12-jam at the left boundary , dissolves first .",
    "@xmath11 particles can enter the system while @xmath12 particles are still blocked until the @xmath11-jam at the right boundary is also dissolved .",
