    "inflation  @xcite is now the standard model of the early universe , solving the problems that big bang cosmology faces and explaining the origin of large scale structure in the way consistent with observations .",
    "however , the inflationary universe still suffers from the problem of initial singularity  @xcite as long as the null energy condition ( nec ) is satisfied . to circumvent the singularity , alternative scenarios such as the bouncing models  @xcite have been proposed so far , but",
    "a majority of the alternative models are unstable due to the violation of the nec .",
    "recently , an interesting class of scalar field theories called the galileon has been constructed  @xcite and various aspects of the galileon theory have been explored extensively in the literature .",
    "one of the most intriguing nature of this theory is that the null energy condition can be violated stably .",
    "thus , the galileon opens up a new possibility of stable , singularity - free models alternative to inflation  @xcite , as well as stable nec violating models of dark energy  @xcite and inflation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an initial phase of nec violating quasi - minkowski expansion driven by the galileon field as an alternative to inflation .",
    "the scenario is called the galilean genesis  @xcite , and different versions of genesis models can be found in refs .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address how the genesis phase is connected to the subsequent hot universe through the reheating stage . in the case of inflation",
    ", reheating usually proceeds with coherent oscillation of the scalar field at the minimum of the potential and its decay .",
    "however , the scalar field that drives galilean genesis does not have the potential .",
    "the situation here is similar to that in kinetically driven inflation models such as k-  @xcite and g - inflation  @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider reheating through gravitational particle production  @xcite .",
    "reheating after galilean genesis has also been discussed in ref .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for the other aspects of genesis models .",
    "the exit from k- and g - inflation is accompanied by the kination phase , _ i.e. , _ the phase where the kinetic energy of the scalar field is dominant .",
    "similarly , the kination phase can also be incorporated at the end of galilean genesis as we will do in this paper .",
    "the primordial gravitational waves that re - enter the horizon during this kination era have a blue spectrum , giving enhanced amplitudes at high frequencies  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the primordial spectrum of gravitational waves is expected to be blue due to nec violating quasi - minkowski expansion in the earliest stage of the universe .",
    "the combined effect will therefore give rise to strongly blue gravitational waves .",
    "in the second part of this paper we evaluate the spectrum of gravitational waves generated from galilean genesis and explore the possibility of testing this alternative scenario _ e.g. , _ with the advanced ligo detector .    in the previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we have developed a general framework unifying the original genesis model  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite , using which we have derived the stability conditions and primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations . the framework is based on the horndeski theory  @xcite , the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory in four dimensions .",

    "however , the lagrangian for generalized galilean genesis does not have the potential term and hence conventional reheating would not be suitable for the genesis scenario .",

    "<S> galilean genesis is an alternative to inflation , in which the universe starts expanding from minkowski with the stable violation of the null energy condition . in this paper , we discuss how the early universe is reheated through the gravitational particle production at the transition from the genesis phase to the subsequent phase where the kinetic energy of the scalar field is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the consequences of gravitational reheating after galilean genesis on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant spectrum is strongly blue , and at high frequencies @xmath0 in terms of the energy density per unit logarithmic frequency . </S>",
    "<S> though this can not be detected in existing detectors , the amplitude can be as large as @xmath1 at @xmath2mhz , providing a future test of the genesis scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed within the framework of generalized galilean genesis based on the horndeski theory , which enables us to derive generic formulas . </S>"
