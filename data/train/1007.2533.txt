    "the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is a common phase of the evolution of stars with mass in the range 18m@xmath5 @xcite . after core - helium burning",
    ", they experience a series of thermal pulses ( tps ) , triggered by the ignition of helium in a thin layer below the cno burning shell , under conditions of thermal instability .",
    "the strong mass loss that they experience favours the ejection of the whole external mantle , with the formation of a co white dwarf .    historically , the interest towards agbs started with the discovery of s - process enriched agb stars @xcite , and with their identification as sites of nucleosynthesis and s - process @xcite , and was futher stimulated by the discovery of carbon and lithium - rich stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) @xcite : they were correctly interpreted as thermally pulsating stars @xcite .",
    "extended investigations of the physical properties of agb stars showed the existence of two mechanisms able to alter the surface chemistry : the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , i.e. the inwards penetration ( in mass ) of the external envelope after each tp into regions earlier involved in @xmath6 nucleosynthesis @xcite ; and hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , when the base of the convective envelope becomes sufficiently hot ( @xmath7k ) to produce proton - capture nucleosynthesis @xcite , and enough energy to cause the breakdown of the core mass - luminosity relation on the agb @xcite .    in more recent years",
    ", we have been gathering the compelling evidence that tp - agb stars play a crucial role in many properties of their host systems , mainly owing to their intrinsic brightness and distinctive spectral features .",
    "for instance , the tp - agb contribution to the total luminosity of single - burst stellar populations reaches a maximum of about 40% at ages from 1 to 3 gyr @xcite , and accounts for most of the bright - infrared objects in resolved galaxies , as clearly demonstrated by denis , 2mass , sage , s@xmath8mc , and akari irc data @xcite for the magellanic clouds ( mc ) .",
    "observational data of agb stars is now available also for other galaxies of the local group  such as leo  i @xcite , leo  ii @xcite , sagittarius @xcite , phoenix @xcite , fornax @xcite  , as well as for more distant dwarf galaxies ( dalcanton 2008 ) .",
    "chemical pollution from massive agb stars is currently one of the most plausible hypothesis to account for the chemical patterns observed in globular cluster ( gc ) stars @xcite , where they may explain the existence of multiple populations @xcite , indicated by the discovery of multiple main sequences in some gcs @xcite .",
    "the pioneering model by @xcite outlines the capability of massive agb stars to provide an efficient pollution of the interstellar medium , and to stimulate the formation of new stellar generations , with predicted photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with observations .",
    "moving from zero to high redshift , the light contribution from agb stars becomes significant in the optical , where galaxies are dominated by intermediate - age stars @xcite .",
    "this fact is crucial : it has been recently pointed out that quantifying the weight of tp - agb stars has a large impact on the mass assembly in high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the prominent role played by agb stars in so many astrophysical contexts has increased the demand for detailed agb modelling . since full computations of the tp - agb phase",
    "are extremely time - consuming , given the short time steps that must be used during each tp , many synthetic models have been developed and are presently used , in which , based on existing full models , the agb properties are parametrized as a function of stellar mass and metallicity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately full agb modelling is dependent on the assumptions on many physical ingredients that are not known from first principles , and must be described by means of semi - empirical calibrations .",
    "the treatment of convection is ascribed most of the large differences among agb models in the existing literature : the efficiency of the convective instability , and the assumptions concerning the extension of the mixed regions have a strong impact on the physical and chemical evolution of massive agb stars @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have also shown that the main evolutionary properties of agb stars can be critically affected by the radiative low-@xmath9 opacities adopted to model their outer mantles . the use of opacities that correctly account for the drastic changes in the molecular chemistry of the gas , when the c / o ratio passes from below to above unity , is mandatory , otherwise the general expansion of the outer layers triggered by the opacity increase is missed @xcite . since",
    "one of the most significant consequences of a correct computation of the molecular opacities is a sudden increase in mass loss , a careful study of the effects driven by molecular opacities on the evolutionary properties and stellar yields requires to investigate the impact of mass loss , and its uncertainties .    in order to produce more reliable full agb models , that may also contribute a useful input to synthetic agb models ,",
    "we have started a new project dedicated , in a first phase , to understand and quantify the main uncertainties associated to the various input physics .",
    "the properties of the most massive agb stars , and the relevant role played by convection modelling , was analysed by @xcite . moving to lower masses ,",
    "@xcite have discussed the role played by molecular opacities . in this work",
    "we concentrate on how the opacity treatment is interfaced with the description of mass loss , and which results in the literature need a substantial revision .",
    "future steps will be an extensive comparison of model predictions with observations , to provide the astrophysical community with more reliable yields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_uncert ] summarizes the uncertainties affecting agb models .",
    "the physical ingredients of the models presented in the present investigation are detailed in sect .",
    "[ sec_input ] .",
    "section  [ sec_mod ] is dedicated to the analysis of the physical properties of the models , and how they depend on the choices concerning opacity and mass loss .",

    "a comparison with the results from other investigations on the same topic is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec_compar ] .",
    "the theoretical description of the agb evolution is extremely sensitive to the input physics used to calculate the models : the treatment of the convective instability , the description of mass loss , the extent of the possible extra - mixing region beyond the formal convective / radiative boundary determined by the classic schwartzschild criterion , the adopted low - temperature opacities , and the nuclear cross - sections of some p- and @xmath10capture reactions . an exhaustive analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xcite , following the analysis by @xcite and @xcite , showed that convection modelling plays an important role in determining the evolution during the tp phase : the differences in the convection modelling have been recognized as the main cause responsible for the discrepancies among the results obtained by different groups @xcite .",
    "the assumption of some convective overshoot from the bottom of the envelope is closely associated to the occurrence of tdu after a tp that , in turn , is confirmed by the discovery of many carbon stars in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the analyses by @xcite and @xcite , based on synthetic tp - agb models , indicate that the extent of the tdu required to reproduce the luminosity function of the mcs should be larger than predicted by the standard models , where tdu is found in the context of the schwarzschild criterion .    with respect to mass loss along the agb",
    ", several prescriptions , based on either theoretical or empirical grounds , have been proposed in the literature . among them",
    "we recall : reimers classical law ( 1975 ) was a fit of measured mass - loss rates as a function of @xmath11 ; @xcite ( hereinafter vw93 ) was based on the observed correlation between mass - loss rates and periods of pulsating agb stars ; @xcite proposed a modification to the reimers law based on fitting models from @xcite ; @xcite presented a prescription based on dynamical models of pulsating oxygen - rich atmospheres including the formation of dust ; basing on those models @xcite derived a mass - loss formalism as a function of basic stellar parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ; @xcite proposed a formula based on dust - driven superwind models of c stars ; @xcite presented an empirical calibration based on observations of dust - enshrouded red supergiants and oxygen - rich agb stars ; @xcite introduced a correction to the reimers formula based on some physical arguments ; @xcite ( hereinafter s06 ) formulated a revised calibration of the mass loss - period relation for pulsating agb stars .    in agb models , an additional source of uncertainty",
    "is related to the adopted low - t radiative opacities , which quantify the removal of radiation energy as photons pass through the h - rich mantle .",
    "the early predictions by @xcite were confirmed by @xcite , who showed how the physical and chemical evolution of low - mass , low - z stars are affected by the adoption of the correct opacity treatment .",
    "the models presented in this paper were calculated by means of the aton code for stellar evolution @xcite , a full description of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "convection was modelled according to the full spectrum of turbulence ( hereinafter fst ) prescription by @xcite . mixing of chemicals and nuclear burning were coupled by means of a diffusive approach , following the scheme presented in @xcite ; accordingly , convective overshoot was modelled by an exponential decay of convective velocities beyond the formal borders , with an e - folding decay of @xmath15 . during the two main phases of core nuclear burning and in occurrence of the second dredge - up we used @xmath16 , in agreement with the calibration based on the width of the main sequences of open clusters given in @xcite . during the tp - agb phase ,",
    "given the uncertainties outlined in the previous section , no overshoot was considered .",
    "to investigate the sensitivity of the results obtained on the mass loss prescription , our choice was to compare the findings obtained with two different prescriptions , namely @xcite and @xcite . in the former case it is assumed , based on hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , a steep increase of mass loss with luminosity as the star enters the agb phase",
    "this is simulated by multiplying the canonical reimers formula by a luminosity power ( l@xmath17 ) .",
    "the free parameter entering the reimer s prescription is @xmath18 , according to the calibration of the luminosity function of lithium - rich stars observed in the magellanic clouds given in @xcite .    in @xcite the mass - loss rate",
    "is made vary with the pulsation period in the fundamental mode : compared to vw93 the empirical revision by s06 ( see their figure 5 ) , based on a compilation of more recent data , predicts larger mass - loss rates for pulsation periods in the range @xmath19 days , whilst lower rates are associated to periods larger than 500 days .      for the equation of state ( eos ) we adopted the latest version of the opal eos ( 2005 ) where available , superseded by the @xcite eos in the partial ionization regime .",
    "the eos is extended to the high - density , high - temperature regime according to the description given in @xcite .",
    "the radiative opacities were calculated following the opal prescription , according to @xcite .",
    "the conductive opacities were taken from poteckin ( 2006 ) .",
    "as to the low - temperature opacities , i.e. @xmath20 , we used the same large data set of tables as in @xcite , which were computed with the sopus tool ( marigo & aringer 2009 ) to consistently follow the significant changes in the cno surface abundances caused by the tdu and hbb during the tp - agb evolution .    the opacity set was designed to account for the complex interplay between convection and nucleosynthesis , so that variations in the c / o ratio can be driven by positive / negative changes in both carbon and oxygen abundances . for instance , while an increment of c / o is predicted due to the tdu , when hbb takes place the c / o ratio is expected either to decrease , as long as c is converted into n by the cn cycle , or even to increase if o is efficiently burnt in favour of n by the on cycle ( see sect .",
    "[ ssec_nucleos ] ) .",
    "variations in cno abundances affect the low - temperature opacities essentially in two ways , i.e. i ) for @xmath21 k by modifying the equilibrium molecular pattern depending on the c / o ratio and , to a less extent , ii ) for larger temperatures by changing the contributions of the cno atoms to both the continuum and line opacity . a detailed discussion can be found in marigo & aringer ( 2009",

    "the stellar models discussed here were followed from the pre - ms phase to almost the complete ejection of the external envelope . the initial chemical composition of the gas is assigned a total metallicity ( mass fraction ) @xmath1 and a degree of @xmath10enhancement @xmath27=+0.4 $ ] , with the reference solar mixture taken from @xcite .    to investigate how much the results are affected by the the interplay between the use of the opacities accounting for the cno variations and the mass - loss description we calculated 4 sets of evolutionary models , designated with s06h , s06c , bh , and bc , which differ in the adopted prescriptions as outlined in table  [ tab_mod ] . specifically , we consider two formalisms for the mass loss , i.e. straniero et al .",

    "each point marks the quiescent stage of pre - tp luminosity maximum .",
    "the solid lines are iso - mass locii , and connect the four evolutionary sequences at the stages when the total mass of the star has been reduced to 2.9 , 2.7 , 2.5 and 2m@xmath5 . in all four cases considered here the 3m@xmath5 models share a few common features , namely : i ) they experience hbb , which is usually associated to an overluminosity effect , and ii ) they enter the domain of c - stars , as the surface c / o ratio increases above unity due to the tdu . at the same time",
    "significant differences arise .",
    "the s06h and s06c models experience a much weaker mass loss at the beginning , evolving at approximately constant mass for many tps ; this is at odds with the behaviour of bh and bc models , where an efficient mass loss determines an earlier extinction of hbb and its overluminosity ( following a rapid cooling of the envelope structure ) .",
    "this circumstance is seen in the maximum luminosity attained , which is @xmath29  dex fainter than in s06h and s06c sequences .",
    "the role played by the opacity treatment can be understood by examining the evolution of models sharing the same description of mass loss , e.g. the s06h and s06c models . in the latter ,",
    "the rapid increase in the mass loss rate as soon as the surface c / o exceeds unity ( clearly detectable as a jump in @xmath30 ) favours an earlier reduction of the mass of the external mantle , which again causes an earlier drop in the luminosity @xmath31 ( we have a @xmath32  dex difference in the maximum luminosity in this case ) .",
    "the drop in @xmath31 is associated to a lower temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope , i.e. less favourable conditions for hbb . as a consequence",
    ", we may conclude that , in general , using a mass loss description only mildly dependent on the luminosity , and/or neglecting the changes in the molecular chemistry in the opacity computations when c / o@xmath33 , correspond to larger temperatures in the external mantle , in favour of a more efficient hbb .",
    "figure  [ mcore ] shows the evolution of the c - o core mass during the tp - agb phase of models with different initial masses and/or input proscriptions . the bh and bc models ( full squares and open triangles ) evolve to smaller core masses , as a result of the higher mass loss in their early tp - agb phase .    in the left panel",
    "we see that in the less massive bh and bc models the mass of the remnant is almost independent of the adopted opacity , being only slightly higher , as expected , in the bh case .",
    "when the @xcite mass loss rate is used ( s06h and s06c models ) the masses of the remnant differ more significantly ( see col.3 of table [ yields ] ) , the discrepancy consisting in @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the difference in @xmath40 is higher at lower masses , because these models reach more easily the c - rich stage , that is accompanied by an increase in the molecular opacity in the s06c models .",
    "the stronger sensitivity of the s06h and s06c models to the opacity treatment compared to the bh and bc models can be explained by the fact the @xcite formalism predict quite high mass - loss rates so that the models become c - rich when most of their envelope masses have already been lost , with consequent little possibility for establishing great differences in the mass of the remnants .",
    "the evolution of @xmath41 for higher mass models is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mcore ] .",
    "the bh and bc lines are again almost over - imposed in this diagram , and the differences between the s06h and s06c sets of models persist up to masses of the order of @xmath42 , whereas in more massive models the surface c / o ratio hardly approaches unity , thus rendering the results almost opacity - independent . for the @xmath43 model",
    "we note that the tracks are practically split into two branches , according to the mass loss treatment .",
    "the description given above can be complemented with the behaviour of the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope , @xmath44 .",
    "this is the key - quantity to understand the degree of nucleosynthesis expected , and thus the chemical composition of the ejecta .",
    "the evolution of @xmath44 as a function of the current stellar mass is shown for all models in fig .",

    "are never reached , with the only exception of the s06h models , where the relatively mild mass loss , due both to the @xcite prescription itself and to the molecular opacities that neglect cno variations , favours the increase in the core mass and temperature at the bottom of the envelope , eventually reaching hbb conditions .",
    "[ carb2 ]    this is confirmed by the two panels of fig .",

    "the bc models undergo a smaller number of tps as a consequence of the higher mass loss rates experienced as the c / o ratio exceeds unity , therefore the surface carbon is lower .",
    "an increasing trend of the carbon abundance is also shown by the s06c models ( long - dashed ) , although in this case most of the carbon enhancement is achieved at the beginning , when the mass lost is negligible ; at later stages the strong mass loss triggered by the formation of c - bearing molecules prevents further meaningful changes in the surface carbon mass fraction .",
    "different is the behaviour of the s06h models ( dashed lines ) in both panels of fig .",
    "[ carb1 ] : the fact that hbb is operating can be recognized from the rapid drop of the surface carbon abundance ( being converted into nitrogen ) . in these cases",
    "the ejecta of the stars are expected to be carbon - depleted .    moving to higher masses , we see from fig .  [ carb2 ] that in the @xmath49 model hbb conditions are reached in both the s06c and s06h models , whereas in the models calculated with the @xcite mass loss hbb",
    "is quenched when the correct opacities are adopted ( compare the dotted and solid tracks in fig .",
    "[ carb2 ] and the corresponding evolution of @xmath44 marked by open triangles and full squares in the bottom ",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ tbce ] ) .",
    "hbb is found in all models of higher mass , as can be seen in the right panels of fig .",
    "the only difference we see here is the different mass left in the envelope when the asymptotic temperature at the bottom of the envelope is reached . for the same reasons previously discussed ,",
    "s06h and s06c models reach this stage when only a small amount of mass has been lost : this will have some effects on the yields ( see sect .",
    "[ sec_yields ] ) .",
    "the results confirm the analysis by @xcite and the main findings of the investigation by @xcite : low - mass agb models need to be calculated with the correct low - t opacities , that account for the changes in the molecular chemistry driven by variations of the c / o ratio , and more generally in the cno abundances .",
    "neglecting the surface carbon enrichment in the opacity computations delays the ejection of the external mantle , leads to a higher final core mass and , in more massive models , leads to higher temperatures at the envelope base , hence favouring the development of hbb .    the extent of the changes introduced by a correct opacity computation is conditioned to the treatment of mass loss .",
    "the indirect effects of using c - rich opacities on the growth of the remnant core , maximum luminosity and temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope are larger when the mass loss in the early agb phase is sufficiently mild .",
    "in fact , under these circumstances , the c - rich stage is reached when the envelope still contains a large fraction of mass ; this applies , for instance , when a treatment like the @xcite is used .",
    "models calculated with the @xcite formula are less sensitive to the opacity changes .    the analysis on hbb made by @xcite is confirmed . for the reasons mentioned above , the quenching of hbb in models calculated with the @xcite mass - loss description",
    "is restricted to a narrow range of masses ( clustering around 3m@xmath5 in the present investigation ) .",
    "conversely , when a more moderate mass loss , e.g. the vw93 or the modification suggested by @xcite is used , the extinction of hbb involves a wider range of masses , that in this investigation spans the interval from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "all models with m@xmath52m@xmath5 achieve hbb conditions regardless of the opacity treatment , because the c / o ratio keeps in any case well below unity .",
    "some differences between models differing in the mass loss treatment persist up to @xmath53 , and tend to disappear for larger masses . as extensively discussed in @xcite , in this range of masses the key quantity , that controls the activation and the strength of hbb , is the treatment of the convective instability , and , specifically , the efficiency of convection .",
    "changes in the surface chemical composition of agb stars are caused by hbb and tdu .",
    "the former keeps the overall c+n+o abundance constant , whereas tdu increases the carbon abundance , hence the total c+n+o , independently of the possible later conversion ( via hbb ) of @xmath54c to @xmath22n at the bottom of the convective zone .      in the context of the distinctive chemical patterns exhibited by gc stars ,",
    "the surface c+n+o is a key - quantity in the debate concerning the self - enrichment scenario by massive agb stars @xcite , because the spectroscopic surveys of gc stars confirmed that the total c+n+o is approximately constant @xcite , even when comparing stars with different surface abundances of other elemental species .",
    "therefore , agb ejecta with a great cno enhancement would rule out their role as the possible cause of the observed patterns @xcite .",
    "the cno increase in the ejecta is shown in fig .",
    "[ cno ] ; this is the same quantity reported in col .",

    "[ yields ] . in all cases",
    "r(cno ) shows a maximum for m@xmath55m@xmath5 : lower masses experience fewer tdus , whereas in more massive models the effects of tdu are reduced , due to dilution of the dredged - up , c - rich material into a massive envelope .    for @xmath56 , similarly to other quantities discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_mod ] , r(cno ) depends mainly on the mass - loss prescription ; the models split into two branches .",

    "interestingly , for m@xmath57m@xmath5 the two branches tend to converge to unity ( i.e. invariance of the total c+n+o ) , since these models are characterised by quite efficient hbb and large luminosities , which lead to a quick ejection of the envelope .    for @xmath58",
    "the treatment of the molecular opacities becomes more important : the cno enhancement is lower for s06c and bc models compared to s06h and bh .",
    "the largest r(cno ) is reached by the s06h models ( dashed line ) due to the great number of tps experienced , while the others ( bh , bc and vw models ) show more similar trends .",

    "[ cnona ] shows the chemical content of the ejecta , on the [ c / fe ] vs. [ n / fe ] plane .",
    "models with the same mass are connected with continuous lines .",
    "the points in the lower - right corner correspond to low - mass models ( @xmath45 ) not experiencing any hbb , and are characterized by large [ c / fe ] as a consequence of the tdu . in general ,",
    "a large value of [ n / fe ] is a signature of hbb .",
    "the spread in [ n / fe ] relative to models with masses in the range 23m@xmath5 is a mere consequence of the different ( if any ) degree of hbb achieved in these masses .",
    "s06h models ( full triangles ) constitute a sort of upper envelope for the n enrichment : as discussed previously , these models experience a large number of tdus , and hbb is always efficient .",
    "note the position of the 1.5m@xmath5 bc model , indicated by the full square with the lowest [ n / fe ] : the chemical content of the mass ejected shows only a modest increase in carbon and no change in nitrogen , because the higher mass loss quickly leads to end of the agb phase .",

    "higher mass models experience a more powerful hbb , thus exhibit a lower [ c / fe ] in their ejecta .",
    "the relatively modest [ n / fe ] is due to the lower efficiency of tdu in increasing the surface abundance of carbon when the dredged - up material is diluted into a massive envelope : for the same reason this limits the increase of nitrogen , which is produced by proton - captures on carbon nuclei .      the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cnona ] shows the oxygen and sodium content of the yields , in terms of [ na / fe ] vs. [ o / fe ] .",
    "these two elements are the main targets in the spectroscopic surveys of gcs , and the oxygen - sodium anti - correlation is a well - established pattern observed in practically all the gcs @xcite .",
    "the ejecta of the lowest masses are o - enriched ( we recall that the initial abundance of our @xmath10enhanced mixture is [ o / fe]=+0.4 ) , due to tdu .",
    "the s06c models ( open circles ) show a slightly higher [ o / fe ] , because they experience many tdus , and hbb is far from being activated , thus keeping the surface oxygen high .",
    "the greater is the mass , the lower is the oxygen content of the ejecta , due to hbb which destroys @xmath59o via proton captures in favour of @xmath60n .",
    "the behaviour of sodium at the surface of agb stars is described in details in @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "the surface sodium content is unchanged in the lowest masses ( see also col .  8 in tab .",
    "[ yields ] ) , while increases in models ( m@xmath61m@xmath5 ) where the temperature at the bottom of the envelope is high enough to convert the dredged - up @xmath25ne to na . similarly to nitrogen , the largest differences in [ na / fe ] due to mass - loss and opacity prescriptions are found in those models with mild hbb ( note again the higher values attained by the s06h models ) . for higher temperatures the destruction channel of na via proton capture prevails over production , leading to the lower [ na / fe ] for larger stellar masses .",
    "the analysis developed so far allows us to have a first appraisal of the uncertainties affecting the yields from agb stars produced by two main factors : mass loss and low - t radiative opacities .",
    "we have explored two treatments of mass loss which , especially in the early phases of the agb evolution , differ considerably : in this way our investigation should sample the present status of indetermination in the chemical yields .    in agreement with previous investigations , we confirm that using opacities coupled to the actual surface composition is mandatory for masses below a threshold value , corresponding to the full activation of hbb , which in the present work corresponds to @xmath62 . when the changes in the molecular chemistry are correctly accounted for in the opacities , the attainment of the c - rich stage ( c / o@xmath33 ) is usually accompanied by a sudden increase in the mass loss , which favours the ejection of the whole mantle , speeding up the end of the agb evolution .",
    "the enrichment in carbon and cno is consequently lower .",
    "typically , the changes in the yields , determined by use of the correct opacities , are more significant in models where a milder dependency of mass loss on luminosity is adopted .",
    "in fact , this would correspond to a longer tp - agb lifetime during which the surface composition may be affected by i ) a larger number of tdu episodes , and ii ) more favourable conditions for the development of hbb .",
    "conversely , assuming a very efficient mass - loss formalism , as predicted by a @xcite - like law , the accuracy loss introduced by unsuitable opacities ( e.g. valid for scaled - solar mixture ) is less dramatic , since the carbon - rich stage is reached when a considerable fraction of the mass of the envelope is already lost .    within this general trend ,",
    "the sensitiveness of the yields to the model assumptions vary according to the mass of the star , as outlined below .",
    "the largest uncertainties in the yields belong to stars for which the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope is just sufficient to ignite hbb , i.e. @xmath63 . in particular , [ n / fe ] and [ na / fe ] may vary by @xmath64  dex , depending on the assumed input prescriptions . the oxygen yield is more robust .    at lower masses , i.e.",
    "@xmath65 , the results are more affected by the mass - loss description : the tdu does not even take place when the @xcite prescription is followed , being prevented by a rapid expulsion of the external envelope .",
    "above @xmath66 the opacity treatment become less influential , and most of the uncertainty in the yields should be ascribed to the the mass - loss treatment .",
    "this investigation has also shown that , although the yields may vary according to the adopted mass - loss rate in any range of mass , the predicted trends between different elemental species do not depend on the model assumptions , e.g. the slopes in both [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] and [ o / fe]-[na / fe ] diagrams are preserved ( see fig .  [ cnona ] ) .",
    "in view of testing the reliability of agb models , we compare our results with investigations by other research groups , focusing on the the recent investigations by @xcite and @xcite , in which low - t opacities are suitably calculated by considering the increase in the surface carbon abundance , an essential requirement to correctly describe c - rich stage .",
    "we consider , in particular , the models computed with same initial mass , @xmath67 , that include our s06c and bc models , the @xmath1 model by @xcite ( see their tab .",
    "3 ) , and the @xmath68 model by @xcite ( see their tab .",
    "although the initial chemical compositions are not the same , ( @xcite use a scaled - solar mixture with @xmath1 , whereas @xcite adopt an @xmath10enhanced mixture with z=0.0005 ) , the main differences can be explained in terms of the different input prescriptions .",
    "one striking feature is the different number of tps experienced , that is @xmath69 in @xcite , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in our two s06c and bc cases , and only @xmath72 in @xcite , despite of the fact that this latter model corresponds to the lowest metallicity .",
    "the small number of tps found in the @xcite work is accompanied by a shorter agb life - time , which is @xmath73 of our estimated values . due to the absence of hbb",
    ", we rule out convection as a possible cause of such a discrepancy , and focus on the other two , uncertain , physical inputs , i.e. mass loss and the treatment of the convective borders , particularly during the tdu phase .",
    "let us first focus on the effect produced by different mass - loss treatments . figure .",
    "[ conf ] shows the evolution of the mass - loss rate in our @xmath67 agb model computed with the aton code , assuming cno - variable molecular opacities and three choices for @xmath30 , namely : @xcite ( open circles ) , @xcite ( open triangles ) , and @xcite ( full squares ) .",
    "we recall that this latter scheme assumes a reimers formula up to a threshold pulsational period of @xmath74 days , followed by the @xcite rate when the c - star stage is reached .",
    "we note that the @xcite treatment favours rates significantly smaller , particularly at the beginning of the agb phase , with differences up to @xmath75  dex compared to the others .",
    "a smaller difference exists between the @xcite and the @xcite recipes , the latter being higher by @xmath76  dex during most of the evolution .    in the early agb",
    "the @xcite treatment predicts rates of the order of @xmath77/yr , which are , however , not sufficient to diminish the total number of tps so as to recover their original result ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this suggests that the main reasons for the smaller number of tps in the @xcite investigation compared to our models is an earlier transition to the c - star stage .",
    "this difference is due to two reasons : a ) the modelling of convective overshoot from the bottom of the envelope ( see their equation 2 ) , based on an exponential decay of the diffusive coefficient , with the same e - folding distance used for main - sequences width fitting .",
    "this approach determines a much deeper extension of tdu when compared with our models ( where no overshoot is assumed ) , and with those by @xcite , who adopt an exponential decay of the convective velocity from the inner border of the external mantle , with an e - folding distance tuned in order to allow the synthesis of a given amount of @xmath78c available for neutron - captures .",
    "this amount of extra - mixing is also the plausible reason for the smaller number of tps experienced by the @xcite model compared to our s06c , and to the different final core - masses ( @xmath79 , to be compared to @xmath80 ) ; b ) the convective overshoot from the he - burning shell , adopted by @xcite , and neglected here and in @xcite , which , as described by @xcite , renders the pulses stronger .",
    "the models presented here , though including no overshoot , are much more similar to those by @xcite in terms of duration of the whole agb phase and of the chemistry of the ejecta .    a detailed investigation of the tdu phenomenology , and the possible effects of assuming some convective overshoot from the bottom of the convective envelope , is beyond the scope of the present paper ;",
    "the interested reader may find in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite a full discussion on the key issues relevant to address this problem .",
    "anyhow , the present study clearly illustrates that the agb evolution is the product of a complex interplay between various processes : the treatment of the extra - mixing , for instance , has a remarkable impact not only on the chemical but also on the physical properties of these stars .",
    "in view of improving the robustness of the results provided by agb modelling ( or at least to quantify the uncertainty range ) , we have investigated the sensitivity of the main physical and chemical properties to the choices inherent the input macro- and micro - physics .",
    "we find a threshold mass , that is @xmath81 for @xmath1 in the present analysis , ( note that it also depends on the assumed overshooting from the central regions during the core h- and he - burning ) , above which the results are little sensitive to the opacity treatment , because hbb prevents the surface c / o ratio to exceed unity .    in this range of",
    "masses mass loss modelling plays a crucial role .",
    "models calculated with a treatment of the mass loss only mildly dependent on the luminosity , such as the classic @xcite or the @xcite recipe used here , predict smaller rates during most of the agb phase , thus more tps are experienced .",
    "this also favours the growth of the luminosity and temperature at the bottom of the convective zone , and a more advanced hbb nucleosynthesis : the yields will contain the signature of proton - capture nucleosynthesis , e.g. lower carbon and oxygen abundances , and higher nitrogen content . however , the general patterns of the c - n and o - na relations , and the very small increase in the overall cno abundance , are almost independent of the opacity and mass - loss treatment : we expect convection modelling plays a relevant role here , in agreement with the analysis by @xcite .    for masses smaller than @xmath66 the interplay between opacity and mass - loss treatment is more tricky , because the lack of hbb favours the increase in surface carbon . generally speaking , we confirm the results by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite : the use of the correct opacities in the low - t regime speeds - up the loss of the stellar envelope , via the strong winds associated to the general expansion of the structure when the surface c / o ratio exceeds unity .",
    "we expect in this case a smaller number of tps , and a less advanced nucleosynthesis ( if any ) at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "models calculated with a mass - loss rate steeply dependent on the luminosity show a more homogeneous behaviour , whereas when a milder dependency of @xmath30 with luminosity , e.g. a relationship that relates @xmath30 to the stellar period , is adopted , many physical properties , e.g. core - mass , temperature at the bottom of the convective zone , total number of thermal pulses experienced , follow a completely different behaviour . in this case the quenching of hbb determined by the use of the c - rich opacities , predicted by @xcite , is confirmed , being a common feature of all the models with @xmath82",
    ". a narrower range of masses ( around @xmath83 ) is otherwise affected by this uncertainty when an efficient mass - loss prescription , like the @xcite formula , is adopted .",
    "contrary to the models experiencing hbb , the yields from lower mass stars are highly uncertain and model - dependent : the average [ c / fe ] in the ejecta shows up an overall uncertainty of @xmath84  dex , though this difference reduces to @xmath85  dex if models calculated with the same opacities are compared .",
    "the situation for nitrogen and sodium is more extreme , as they are particularly sensitive to the ignition of hbb .",
    "the differences in [ n / fe ] and [ na / fe ] can reach @xmath3  dex , and even when comparing models with the same assumptions for the opacity treatment , discrepancies of one order of magnitude still persist .",
    "the oxygen yields appear , instead , more stable .",
    "these trends should be considered representative of agb models with a low metal content ( @xmath86 ) while they need to be further explored at larger metallicities i.e. including those characteristic of the lmc ( ventura et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "moreover , in the present unresolved scenario about the efficiency of tdu and mass loss , a valuable contribution may come from synthetic agb models , i.e. via a thorough calibration of agb properties as a function of stellar mass and metallicity based on a large set of observables ( hr diagrams including the mid infrared , c / m star ratios , chemistry of atmospheres and planetary nebulae , initial - final mass relation , integrated colors and brightness fluctuations ) .",
