    "<S> starting from the high dimensional limit , experimental studies on v@xmath2o@xmath3 indicate that exactly as a usual gas - liquid transition , the three dimensional bandwidth - controlled mott transition belongs to the conventional ising universality class : it is a first - order transition below the critical endpoint at @xmath4 k and affects solely the charge sector  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the relevance of umklapp scattering for the half - filled band leads to the absence of a bandwidth - controlled mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , a mott transition can be triggered as a function of dimensionality .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to reexamine the dimensional - crossover - driven mott transition in the quasi-1d hubbard model at half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> the subject combines many fascinating issues such as the breakdown of spin - charge separation and the binding of spinons into magnons  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this contrasts with the mott insulator in which @xmath56 changes sign in momentum space passing through a zero as a result of a diverging lattice self - energy @xmath57 . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , diverging @xmath62 yields a zero of @xmath56 at the @xmath63-point . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reduces the qp weight of the nearby ghost side . the interference of the neighboring pole and zero becomes stronger with growing @xmath13 and prevented us from resolving the full structure of @xmath56 already at @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pockets](a ) the ghost side remains visible in the spectral function . in analogy with the density - driven mott transition in the 2d hubbard model  @xcite , we believe that the emergence of a large fs above @xmath64 corresponds to a simultaneous annihilation of the adjacent zero and pole leaving the pole carrying a larger qp weight .     point . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : gn ] reveals that @xmath56 remains almost unchanged with respect to the 1d regime up to the @xmath40-selective mott transition at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with : ( i ) the behavior of @xmath62 at @xmath65 which we expect to diverge in the @xmath71 limit up to @xmath52 , and ( ii ) the gap seen in @xmath48 . on further increasing @xmath13 , @xmath56 develops a pole - like feature . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a broad qp peak emerges at @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> its weight is much smaller than that at @xmath68 along the @xmath69 direction included for comparison in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gn ] . </S>",
    "<S> the substantial variation in the scattering rate is a precursory indication of the broken fs at smaller @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us expand briefly on a relationship of our results with real materials such as quasi-1d organic ( tm)@xmath2x salts where tm stands for tmttf ( tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene ) or its selena tmtsf analog  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their unified phase diagram bears similarities to that of the high-@xmath7 cuprates in the sense that as a function of pressure a superconducting phase emerges in the proximity of the insulating mott phase . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of a finite @xmath18 in our studies mimics the unnesting role of pressure . as we show , crossing over from the 1d system to a higher - dimensional regime involves recombination of spinons and holons into the conventional qps and releases the charge from the confinement to the 1d chains . the pressure - induced change in the optical spectroscopy data on ( tmttf)@xmath2x is interpreted as an example of such a charge _ deconfinement _  @xcite . a quantitative comparison would involve studies within a model hamiltonian extended by electron - phonon coupling and long - range coulomb interaction to account for a wide variety of phase transitions observed in the ( tm)@xmath2x families . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find encouraging that our cdmft studies within the bare hubbard model eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hubb ] ) support accumulating experimental evidence that superconductivity in the ( tmtsf)@xmath2x salts is mainly mediated by magnetic fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the signatures of the closed fs contours that we find could be verified in the quantum oscillation experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , our cdmft simulations yield a continuous quantum phase transition between a 1d mott insulating state and a 2d metallic state . on the metallic side </S>",
    "<S> the _ coherence _ temperature below which qps form marks the crossover scale and vanishes at the critical point . at energy scales below the coherence temperature and in the close vicinity of the transition point , </S>",
    "<S> the fs topology shows hole and electron pockets . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute their origin to the remnant 1d umklapp scattering at the nodal momenta . </S>",
    "<S> such a mechanism can also account for the pockets observed in the _ spinless _ model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the pockets with @xmath13 can be understood by tracking the zero and poles of the single - particle green s function . at energy scales above the coherence temperature , </S>",
    "<S> remnant features of spin - charge separation are apparent in the single - particle spectral function . at the two - particle level , </S>",
    "<S> the metallic state is characterized by enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the very close vicinity of the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> these magnetic fluctuations act as a glue for paring correlations with a @xmath0-wave character . on the insulating side , </S>",
    "<S> the crossover scale is set by the mott gap . below this energy scale </S>",
    "<S> we observe robust 1d mott physics : aspects of spin - charge separation are visible both in the spectral function and @xmath73 magnetic fluctuations which remain intact . </S>",
