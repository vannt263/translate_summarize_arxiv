    "the research on a single layer of graphite  graphene  has been advanced tremendously after its successful exfoliation ,  @xcite the importance of which can not be overstated . due to its exceptional electronic , thermal , and mechanical properties",
    ", graphene virtually finds its potential in every aspect of modern technology .",
    "for example , it could have tremendous applications in microelectronics due to its high electron mobility .",
    "it also has a great deal of potential in spintronics ,  @xcite where the spin current is utilized . from the theoretical perspective , it has been a test ground for many fundamental physics laws due to its similarity to massless dirac fermions ,  @xcite where the `` speed of light '' is replaced by the graphene fermi velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the property of a magnetic impurity in a metallic host is an important problem in condensed matter physics . in a conventional metal , the kondo effect , where the itinerant electrons completely screen the magnetic moment of the impurity , is always present at low temperatures .",
    "the impurity property is not sensitive to the detailed band structure of the host metal .",
    "the most important element from the impurity bath is its density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath3 , and it enters the physics through the scattering rate @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the hybridization matrix between the impurity and host electrons .",
    "this is due to the fact that in conventional metals , the dos around the fermi energy is almost a finite constant .",
    "however , it has been theoretically found that vanishing host dos ( power law or otherwise ) could lead to significant changes to the kondo physics .  @xcite the main finding , among many others , is that the small available states around @xmath6 for conduction electrons makes the effective hybridization between the band electron and the impurity vanishingly small .",
    "this ineffective screening of the impurity moment causes the impurity to decouple from the conduction media and form a free local moment ( lm ) .",
    "withoff and fradkin  @xcite found that the kondo coupling , @xmath7 , has to be larger than some critial value for the kondo effect to take place .",
    "however , the dependence of the magnetic impurity state on the conduction electron dos is a tricky one . for exmaple",
    ", numerical renormalization group calculation shows that the impurity state depends not only on the index of a power law dos but also on the size of this power law region .",
    "@xcite    the hexagonal structure of graphene has two inequivalent carbon atoms , a and b , in one unit cell . in the tight bind approximation , the graphene electronic structure is modelled by a nearest neighbor hopping integral @xmath8 .",
    "further neighboring hopping integrals are small and are usually neglected .",
    "the conduction and valence bands then touch at the corners of the graphene brillouin zone , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are called the dirac points .",
    "the dispersion near these dirac points is linear in @xmath11 and the dos is also linear in energy . for all practical purposes ,",
    "this tight binding description is quite accurate .",
    "many peculiar properties of graphene are closely related to this linear dispersion and the corresponding linear dos at low energies .",
    "@xcite the state of a magnetic impurity on graphene is expected to be very different from that on an ordinary metal .",
    "however , the existence of two inequivalent dirac points could also complicate the simple linear dos argument since this may lead to multi - channel kondo effect .",
    "@xcite the specific problem of a magnetic impurity on graphene has recently been studied by several groups .",
    "@xcite besides its theoretical importance as a prototypical many - body toy model , it is also important to understand magnetic impurities on graphene from the application perspective . it was observed that introduction of vacancies into graphite or graphene could indeed induce ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we explore the properties of a magnetic impurity in a single - layer graphene within an anderson impurity model . within the gutzwiller approximation , we are able to obtain a phase diagram within the parameter space spanned by the impurity level and on - site hubbard repulsion .",
    "we identify a parameter region , where local moment is formed on the impurity .",
    "in addition , a re - entrant kondo resonance behavior is found .",
    "the effect of graphene chemical potential , @xmath12 , is also discussed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model hamiltonian for an anderson impurity in the graphene is introduced .",
    "the gutzwiller procedure toward the solution is explained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the results on the local moment formation and kondo resonance state as a result of the competition between the impurity level and on - site hubbard repulsion . finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we start with a single - impurity anderson model in graphene .",
    "the hamiltonian is partitioned into three parts the pristine graphene subsystem @xmath13 , the impurity subsystem @xmath14 , and the hybridization @xmath15 between these two subsystems , that is , @xmath16 where the three parts can be written out explicitly ,    @xmath17    we take a @xmath11-independent hybridization between carbon @xmath18-electrons and the impurity spin , @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , are the vectors connecting to the three nearest neighbors of a carbon site , and @xmath23 is the number of unit cells . as mentioned above , @xmath8 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral , @xmath24ev . in the rest of the paper",
    "we take @xmath8 as the unit of energy .",
    "the impurity is taken to be at the origin of the a - sublattice .",
    "for the more general case where a magnetic adatom is considered , the impurity could be anywhere and hybridization between the impurity and its all neighboring sites should be considered . as discussed by uchoa _",
    ",  @xcite this leads to an effective @xmath11-dependent hybridization @xmath25 .",
    "the rich physics of the anderson impurity model comes from the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath0 on the impurity . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "a hartree - fock approximation is usually sufficient .",
    "for the cases of intermediate to large @xmath0 , more degrees of the correlation effect must be taken into account . here",
    "we take a projection approach and treat @xmath0 in the gutzwiller approximation . in this approximation",
    ", the effect of @xmath0 is taken into account by reducing the effective hybridization between the conduction electrons and the impurity electrons .",
    "for example , in the @xmath26 limit , the process @xmath27 is prohibited if there is already a @xmath28-@xmath29 electron at the impurity site , while there is no such restriction if @xmath30 ; see ref  @xcite for a detailed discussion . on the mean field level ,",
    "we renormalize the hybridization strength @xmath5 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and replace the interaction term with @xmath33 , with @xmath34 . here @xmath35 is the gutzwiller factor that depends on the impurity number occupation @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being the total impurity occupation ) and double occupation @xmath38 .",
    "the spin dependent gutzwiller factor is , @xmath39 note that this form of @xmath35 explicitly breaks the spin rotational invariance , which the model hamiltonian possesses .",
    "however , in the following , we will only concern ourselves with the stability of the nonmagnetic kondo screened state , @xmath40 , and thus concentrate on the calculation where @xmath41 . a constraint term , @xmath42 ,",
    "is also added to the mean field hamiltonian . here",
    "the langrange multipliers , @xmath43 , serve to renormalize the impurity energy level .",
    "although this term is formally the same to a direct hartree decoupling of the interaction term , @xmath44 , the self - consistency conditions are quite different , and thus would lead to different physics .",
    "it is noted that this approach is equivalent to the kotliar - ruckenstein slave - boson approximation ,  @xcite which has been successfully applied in the study of anderson impurity models .",
    "@xcite after the above mean field procedure , we have the renormalized hybridization and impurity hamiltonians , @xmath45 as such , the effective non - interacting hamiltonian is , @xmath46 .",
    "there are two major differences comparred to the hartree - fock mean field approximation .",
    "first , the hybridization strength @xmath5 is renormalized with a factor @xmath35 that is dependent on the impurity occupation @xmath36 and double occupation @xmath38 , which is in turn dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "the second difference is that the impurity level is renormalized by the lagrange multipliers @xmath43 , instead of @xmath47 . in the hartree - fock approximation ,",
    "the impurity level renormalization @xmath47 becomes unphysically large for large @xmath0 .    in the limit @xmath48 ,",
    "the double occupation @xmath38 should tend to zero . by looking at the form of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gsigma ] ) , it is clear that if at the same time @xmath49 goes to 1 , then @xmath35 approaches zero . in this limit , the magnetic impurity and the conduction band decouples since the effective hybridization @xmath31 is now zero .",
    "the impurity is in the lm state .",
    "it is interesting to realize that this is analogous to the brinkman - rice type of metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model at half filling ,  @xcite except that here one requires `` half filling '' on the impurity site . unlike the half filled hubbard model , in addition to the chemical potential @xmath12 , the impurity number occupation is also dependent on several other aspects .",
    "it obviously is a function of the impurity level @xmath1 .",
    "it also depends on @xmath0 , since the interaction modifies the impurity level through @xmath43 .",

    "it is also worth pointing out that having a state with @xmath51 does not mean that the impurity is in the lm state .",

    "[ fig : eu ] for three sets of @xmath92 .",

    "the magnetic state of the lm impurity is not determined in the single impurity case",
    ". a small magnetic field will align it in the direction of the field , due to the zeeman energy . for more than two impurities ,",
    "rkky interaction occurs , and the magnetic state of the impurities in the lm state depends on the nature of this interaction .",
    "for example , for two impurities situated at the lattice sites the rkky interaction could be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , depending on whether they are on the same or opposite sublattice .",
