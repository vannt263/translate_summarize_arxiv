    "often when we embed a new layer of elementary particle theory in the theory of the early universe , we find that new particles become dangerous cosmological relics .",
    "the study of this problem is one of the few tools available for theorists to bridge these two theories .",
    "for example , the gut theory incorporated in the hot big bang model predicted the overproduction of monopoles ; sugra theory predicted the overproduction of gravitinos and moduli fields .",
    "it is interesting to explore if the embedding of string theory in cosmology results in new dangerous relics .",
    "kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles in the universe is a possible signature of string theory physics .",
    "relic kk particles may be good or bad for cosmology , depending on their properties .",
    "if their abundance multiplied by their mass is tuned to be right , and their life time is significantly longer than the age of the universe , the kk particles can be dark matter candidates .",
    "otherwise , and more typically , they are dangerous relics , which may overclose the universe , or violate big bang nucleosynthesis or other astrophysical constraints , depending on their abundance and lifetime .",
    "therefore , the theory of relic kk particles is a powerful tool to study string theory cosmology and to confront it with observations .",
    "the ads / cft duality allows us to translate from the language of the gravitational kk sector to gauge theories .",
    "therefore , independently of string theory , the story of dangerous cosmological relics repeats itself in the context of gauge theories with extra isometries , which contain massive glueballs of different spins",
    ".    we will consider kk particles in a string theory and string theory cosmology setting , which drew significant interest in the last few years , and which can be advanced quantitatively . indeed",
    ", important progress has been made in the studying type iib string theory compactifications with fluxes where the moduli are stabilized  @xcite .",
    "these developments in string theory have raised interests in the embedding of early universe inflation and low energy physics in a fundamental and phenomenologically viable framework .",
    "constructions with fluxes and conifolds induce warped regions of spacetime @xcite - throats - which in turn may be used to generate mass hierarchies .",
    "for instance , the hierarchy between the string scale and the electroweak scale may be generated  la randall - sundrum  @xcite when the standard model degrees of freedom are localized at the bottom of a sufficiently warped throat .",
    "furthermore , warping is an essential ingredient in the attempts to realize brane inflation in the slow - roll regime  @xcite or the dbi regime  @xcite , or in the fast - roll regime  @xcite , see also e.g.  @xcite for recent works .",
    "warped brane / anti - brane inflation involves a pair of brane / anti - brane @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are string theory objects : although inflation in this model may be described with an effective four dimensional field theory , its end point , reheating , is associated with the @xmath2 annihilation , which is not captured by field theory .",
    "reheating from brane / anti - brane annihilation is rather different from ( p)reheating in quantum field theory @xcite , and was investigated in several papers  @xcite , which identified the channels of inflaton energy decay , cascading from tachyon annihilation to the lighter standard model particles through massive closed string loops , kk modes , and brane displacement moduli . indeed ,",
    "if the internal space has warped regions ( throats ) , the mass of the kk modes associated with them is much lower than the fundamental scale , being redshifted by the warp factor at the bottom of the throat .",
    "if the kk modes are sufficiently light then it is natural to expect them to be produced during reheating .",
    "for instance , in models of brane / anti - brane inflation , kk modes are copiously produced by the decay of the closed string loops from the brane / anti - brane annihilation at the end of inflation , and their energy must be efficiently converted into standard model ( sm ) degrees of freedom .",
    "notably , reheating is then bottlenecked through kk modes which are localized around the tip of the throat .",
    "warped brane inflation and reheating after brane annihilation were considered for throat models with high isometries , often described by the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) solution @xcite .",
    "the ks geometry has @xmath3 isometries around the tip of the throat , and it is close to @xmath4 away from the tip .",
    "other known examples of throat solutions also have similar isometries @xcite .",
    "to make the inner space compact , the ks throat is glued to the unwarped calabi - yau ( cy ) part of the manifold . for cosmologists ,",
    "a significant advantage of this model is that the metric of the throat is known analytically , so that kk modes can be studied in some detail .",
    "however , as it was found in  @xcite , the advantage in mathematics is in this case a disadvantage in physics .",
    "indeed , the kk modes in internal spaces with isometries have conserved angular momentum quantum numbers associated with these isometries .",
    "the final decay products of the kk particles , the sm particles , do not have such quantum numbers . therefore kk modes with ( internal ) angular momenta can not decay into sm particles .",
    "moreover , kk particles with opposite angular momenta can not annihilate completely into sm particles due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , we encounter the severe problem that the freezed out fraction of the long - lived angular kaluza - klein modes can overclose the universe  @xcite ! the problem of angular kk modes from an inner geometry with throats is not specific to the warped brane / anti - brane inflationary scenario . independently on the particular realization of inflation , light kk modes may be produced during reheating if they are sufficiently coupled to inflation . in any context where the reheat temperature of the very early universe is large enough , massive kk particles can be produced in the thermal bath .",
    "then , kk modes with angular momenta will again freeze out , and can be dangerous for cosmology .    in a sense ,",
    "the problem of dangerous angular kk modes in string theory cosmology is a re - appearance of the problem of kk modes from dimensional reduction in supegravity in higher dimensions with isometries @xcite .",
    "however , the string theory setting brings new features in cosmology with kk modes . the unwarped cy part of the compact manifold does not preserve the isometries of the throat",
    "therefore , when we embed the ks throat into the compact manifold , the isometries of the throat inevitably get broken .",
    "these deviations from isometries are significant at the base of the throat , close to the unwarped cy , but they decrease exponentially towards the tip of the throat . on the other hand ,",
    "the kk modes are localized at the tip of the throat and their wave functions decrease exponentially towards the base .",
    "the net effect will be some violation of the conservation of the angular momentum of the kk modes . in terms of the four - dimensional effective lagrangian ,",
    "this manifests itself by additional terms describing the decay of angular kk modes into sm particles with small coupling constants , controlled by the isometry breaking .",
    "this makes angular kk modes in the universe not stable but short or long lived , depending on the parameters of the model .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in some detail the decay of kaluza - klein modes with angular momenta associated with the compact manifold in warped flux compactifications , namely , in a ks throat with broken isometries . in section [ sec : background ] we begin with the background throat geometry ; we consider first the ks solution with intact isometries , and we then introduce the isometry breaking .",
    "we use the static perturbations of the ks metric considered in @xcite , where they were connected to symmetry breaking operators in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .    in section [ sec :",
    "modes ] we consider the wave functions of the kk modes in the throat geometry . for definiteness we will discuss the gravi - tensor kk modes ( the spin - two kk modes , or spin - two glueballs ) .",
    "the knowledge of the wave functions allows us to integrate the internal space out , and to study the effective four - dimensional physics of the model . from the spectroscopy of the `` kk atoms ''",
    "( i.e. their masses as a function of the quantum numbers associated with the internal dimensions ) we can constrain the interactions of the kk modes with each others and with sm particles ; this results in `` selection rules '' which control the decay of these modes .",
    "we focus on the @xmath5 part of the geometry as an approximation of the actual ks throat .",
    "we employ standard ( quantum mechanics ) perturbation theory to compute the effect of the isometry breaking perturbations on the wave functions of the kk modes .",
    "the interactions of the kk modes are studied in section [ sec : interactions ] .",
    "we consider the model where the sm fields are localized on a @xmath6-brane around the tip of the same throat where the excited kk modes are located .",
    "we study the possible decay channels of the long - lived modes and find that the leading one is into sm particles .",
    "note that this channel differs from the decay of scalar kk modes into massless gravi - vector particles which was recently considered in @xcite .",
    "the second part of our paper is devoted to the consequences that the kk modes can have for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "we first , in section [ sec : abundance ] , estimate the abundance of angular kk modes which freeze out in the hot expanding universe , and also estimate their life - times .",
    "we will mostly work with the conservative assumption of initial thermal equilibrium of kk modes .",
    "it turns out that the theoretical predictions for the angular kk modes abundance and life - time are very strongly dependent on the parameters of the modes .",
    "therefore , in section [ sec : constraints ] we put together observational constraints on the parameters of kk modes and consequently , on the underlying throat model , using limits from bbn @xcite and the astrophysical @xmath7-ray background @xcite , in case of decaying modes , and limit on the dark matter energy density , in case of lifetimes much greater than the present age of the universe .",
    "we restrict our calculations of the angular kk modes to single - throat settings .",
    "there are several reasons for that .",
    "the case of two throats , with one of them associated with ( brane - antibrane ) inflation ( of energy scale @xmath8 gev or so ) and the other one associated with the standard model sector ( of tev energy scale ) , is often considered in the literature . in the cosmological context , however , the story of kk modes in the two throat models with such significant energy offset has the following conceptual complication , which usually is not addressed in the literature .",
    "indeed , first , the hubble parameter scale @xmath9gev of inflation exceeds the tev mass of the sm throat kk modes .",
    "similarly , the temperature @xmath10 after brane - antibrane reheating exceeds that low mass scale .",
    "for those situations the low energy sm throat will be screened by a horizon .",
    "in other words , the kk mass spectrum of the low energy throat has a gap below defined by @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the simple picture of kk modes tunneling from the inflationary throat to the sm throat throat is relevant only after the temperature of the universe drops below the tev scale , i.e. when the timing of tunneling is longer than @xmath13 sec .",
    "another reason is that tunneling of the angular kk modes between the throats through the bulk of the inner manifold is exponentially suppressed .    in the discussion section",
    "we summarize our calculations and discuss generalizations of our results to other sm models and multiple - throat cases .",
    "in this section , we discuss the background geometry with the warped throat as a part of the inner space manifold .",
    "we will use this construction in the rest of the paper .",
    "we consider a type iib compactification with fluxes turned along the internal dimensions .",
    "a common feature of flux compactification is warping .",
    "the 10-d metric can be written ds^2",
    "= h^-1/2(z ) g_dx^ dx^ + h^1/2(z ) g_ab(z)dz^a dz^b  , or alternatively [ back ] ds^2 = e^2a(y ) g_dx^ dx^ + _ ab(y)dy^a dy^b  .",
    "the greek indices @xmath14 run over the 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath15 of the external spacetime , while the latin indices @xmath16 run over the 6-dimensional coordinates @xmath17 of the internal compact space ( whose metric is @xmath18 ) .",
    "the outer space of the 10-dimensional background is approximated with the 4-dimensional minkowski metric , @xmath19 .. in this paper @xmath20 . ]",
    "the 10-dimensional geometry involves one or several `` throats '' , each of them on one side ends with a regular `` tip '' , and on the other side is smoothly glued to the bulk of the cy manifold .",
    "the known solutions for the throat , e.g. the ks solution , involve specific isometries and formally have a non - compact radial dimension . in order to get a sensible four - dimensional effective theory",
    ", the throat has to be glued to a compact cy which does not preserve these isometries .",
    "this results in deviations from the isometric ks solution , which are increasing as we approach the bulk of the cy . on the other hand , these isometry",
    "breaking perturbations are expected to be exponentially suppressed at the bottom of the throat .    in the following sub - section ,",
    "we discuss in more details the geometry of the throat . in sub - section [ isbr ]",
    ", we consider the breaking of the isometries due to the compact cy . in sub - section [ param ]",
    ", we discuss the essential parameters of the model .",
    "the known example of analytical throat solution ending with a regular tip is given by the klebanov - strassler solution @xcite , where the warped throat contains a deformed conifold .",

    "we will briefly discuss these issues in the last section .",
    "our goal is to give a general discussion of the phenomenological limits due to the long lived kk@xmath304 modes . to keep the discussion as general as possible , motivated by the findings of @xcite , in the following analysis",

    "their number density is independent on the history preceding the establishment of the thermal equilibrium , and it is simply set by the freeze - out temperature at which the interactions changing their number go out of equilibrium .",
    "we show below that , in the region of parameter space of relevance for phenomenology , this freeze out temperature is typically significantly lower than the mass of the kk modes , so that their abundance is strongly boltzmann suppressed .",
    "as we mentioned , it is an interesting and rather involved problem to estimate the initial number density of kk modes ( produced by cascading decays of excited closed strings ) , and to figure out how far from thermal equilibrium the kk modes will be .",
    "if complete thermalization is not achieved , one should expect a higher number density for the kk modes , since the boltzmann suppression will be reduced .",
    "for this reason , the phenomenological bounds that we will discuss below based on the assumption of initial thermal equilibrium should be considered as conservative ones .",
    "let us first study the kk@xmath303 modes .",

    "these reactions slow down and eventually freeze out when the kk@xmath304 modes become nonrelativistic . in this regime",
    "there are three relevant interactions that can potentially reduce the abundance of a kk@xmath304 mode .",
    "the first is a @xmath333 scattering with brane degrees of freedom , mediated by a virtual kk@xmath303 mode .",
    "the second is a @xmath348 scattering into two kk@xmath303 modes .",
    "the third is a @xmath349 inverse decay , producing a kk@xmath303 mode .",
    "once formed , the kk@xmath303 modes then quickly decay into the brane degrees of freedom ( as we saw in the previous subsection ) .",
    "in all these cases , the two incoming kk@xmath304 modes must combine to produce a zero angular momentum ( in the directions corresponding to the isometries unbroken by the brane ) .",
    "this is also the reason why a single kk@xmath304 mode can not interact with kk@xmath303 or the brane modes .    the rate for these interactions can be roughly estimated as @xmath350    since @xmath351 , the first interaction dominates over the second one , due to the greater amount of available channels ( this is certainly true for the lightest kk@xmath304 modes , so that there are few lighter kk@xmath303 modes they can annihilate into ; as we will see",
    ", the abundance of the heavier kk@xmath304 modes is anyhow suppressed relative to the lighter ones ) .",
    "the last process can in principle be faster but ( due to kinematical reasons ) it typically involves only a negligible amount of kk@xmath304 particles .",
    "the two incoming kk@xmath304 particles can inverse decay only into a heavier kk@xmath303 species .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath218 the mass of the kk@xmath303 mode , and by @xmath116 the one of the incoming kk@xmath304 particles of a given species , the momentum of the two particles in the center of mass frame is forced to be @xmath352 as we saw , the masses of the kk modes are discretized in units of @xmath353 it may be possible that , for some special case , there is a kk@xmath303 mode having a mass @xmath218 slightly greater but very close to @xmath354 . in general , however , the value in ( [ momentum ] ) will be of the order of @xmath355 . for the lightest among the kk@xmath304 modes , @xmath356 . in the nonrelativistic regime , the abundance of the kk@xmath304 mode that we are considering is boltzmann suppressed .",
    "most of such particles have momentum @xmath357 .",
    "the inverse decay @xmath358 can only happen if , in the center of mass frame , the particles have the much higher momentum ( [ momentum ] ) .",
    "so , only a very few of the kk@xmath304 modes will be able to perform the inverse decay .",
    "the remaining particles do not have enough energy , and can be depleted only through the first two interactions in  ( [ ratestim ] ) .",
    "for this reason , we neglect the effect of the inverse decay in the abundance of the lightest kk@xmath304 modes ( in this , we differ from @xcite , where the suppression that we have just discussed was not considered ) .",
    "we therefore need to estimate the moment at which the first process in  ( [ ratestim ] ) freezes out . from this , we then obtain the relic abundance of the kk@xmath304 modes .",
    "in the nonrelativistic regime , @xmath359 using the expression  ( [ hub ] ) for the hubble rate we find ( see the previous subsection for more details in obtaining the final estimate ) @xmath360 equalizing this to unity , on can estimate the freeze - out temperature @xmath361 .    in figure  [ fig - mt ]",
    "we show the ratio of @xmath362 when the scatterings go out of equilibrium in the case of parameters which are typical of either a short or a long throat .",
    "we also set a rough bound of @xmath363 for the nonrelativistic approximation for the kk modes to be valid  @xcite . for higher values of @xmath364 the kk@xmath304 decouple while still relativistic , which results in a greater abundance ( at even higher values of @xmath109 we could have that the scattering of the kk modes are never in thermal equilibrium ; the abundance of the kk particles then depends on the specific details of the reheating scenario ; due to this strong model dependence , we do not consider such cases here ) .    since this is the fastest interaction decreasing the number of kk@xmath304 , the moment at which this interaction freezes out sets the relic abundance of this species .",
    "in general , the later the freeze out occurs , the lower is the relic abundance of the mode ( since the boltzmann suppression is greater ) . from the horizontal axis of the figure  [ fig - mt ]",
    "we see that , for any fixed value of @xmath365 , the higher the mass of a kk@xmath303 mode ( greater @xmath152 ) , the higher is the value of @xmath366 at which the freeze out occurs ( later time ) .",
    "therefore , the kk@xmath304 modes with higher mass end up with a lower relic abundance .",
    "we show this in figure  [ fig - abu ] , where we plot the ratio @xmath367 between the resulting number density @xmath368 and the entropy of the relativistic fields on the brane @xmath369 for the two cases @xmath370 .",
    "also in this plot , we show only the cases for which the kk@xmath304 decouple while nonrelativistic .",
    "we can verify that the energy density of the kk@xmath304 modes is negligible with respect to that of the brane fields at the time at which they decouple ( we used this assumption in setting the hubble rate  ( [ hub ] ) ) .",
    "since the kk@xmath304 are nonrelativistic , their energy density is simply their number density times their mass . for sm radiation ( i.e. the light degrees of freedom on the brane ) ,",
    "the energy density is instead related to the entropy density through @xmath371 .",
    "this gives @xmath372    it is also worth noting that , for the specific case of warped brane / anti - brane inflation , the temperature after inflation is never higher than the mass of the kk modes .",
    "indeed , even assuming that the thermalization occurs on a very quick timescale , the energy density during inflation , @xmath373 , leads to a maximal reheating temperature @xmath374 .",
    "using the expression ( [ defxi ] ) for the kk mass , we have @xmath375 as we can see in the fig .",
    "[ fig - abu ] , this value is comparable with the freeze - out temperature that we have obtained above . therefore , our estimate for the number density is reliable in this case only if the thermalization is quick , as it appears from the estimates of the relaxation time given in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the cosmological effects of the kk@xmath304 modes .",

    "we found that the lightest modes with angular momentum can not decay directly into any other two kk modes ( massive or massless ) , independently of the isometry breaking perturbations .",
    "we considered the model where the sm particles are localized on a ( probe ) @xmath6-brane inside the throat . in this model",
    "the leading decay channel of the angular kk relics is the decay into brane degrees of freedom .",
    "different kk modes may decay through isometry breaking perturbations with different exponents @xmath433 , resulting in exponentially different lifetimes .",
    "our final expression for the lifetime of the relic kk modes then depends on several parameters : the degree of isometry breaking at the tip of the throat @xmath433 , the volume of the internal space @xmath95 , the ads curvature radius @xmath41 , and the throat warping @xmath434 .",
    "for completeness we also included as a parameter the position of the sm brane inside the throat @xmath435 .",
    "remarkably , the coupling between angular kk modes and the sm particles can be much weaker than the gravitational coupling .",
    "we then studied the cosmological constraints on the parameters of the single throat model .",
    "we distinguished two limiting cases : a short throat where brane inflation occurs , and a long throat related to the hierarchy problem . in both cases , we considered the standard model fields to be located at the tip of the throat and to be at some moment in thermal equilibrium with the lightest kk modes .",
    "the freeze - out abundance of the kk relics then depends essentially on a single parameter @xmath436 , although the dependance is very strong .",
    "we considered the influence of the kk relics on the thermal history of the universe and put together observational constrains on the parameters of kk modes and consequently , on the underlying throat model , using limits from bbn @xcite and the astrophysical @xmath7-ray background @xcite , in the case of decaying modes , and limits on the dark matter energy density , in the case of lifetimes much greater than the present age of the universe .",
    "such limits are very sensitive to the parameters of the models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - bbnshort ] for the short throat , and fig .",
    "[ fig - long ] for the long throat cases ) , but we can exhibit some general trends .    in the short throat , the lifetime of the kk relics is much shorter than in the long throat ( since the warp factor is smaller and , consequently , physical times are quicker ) , but their relic abundance is also much higher . in this case , we must require that these modes decay before the onset of bbn , namely with a lifetime @xmath437 . for greater lifetimes , the bbn and overclosure limits are typically exceeded by many orders of magnitude ; therefore , the demand that the decay takes place before the onset of bbn holds even if the thermal history for the kk modes is slightly different than the one considered here ( for instance , even if they do not reach perfect thermal equilibrium before they decay ) .",
    "we also showed that , for natural values of the parameters , the kk modes can dominate the energy density of the universe before decaying , see fig .",
    "[ fig - regshort ] .",
    "this leads to an intermediate stage of matter domination in the early universe , which may have interesting consequences .",
    "for instance , it alters the thermal history of the universe , it affects the relation between the wavelength of present - day cosmological fluctuations and the corresponding number of e - folds of inflation , etc .    for the long throat case ,",
    "a large fraction of the parameters space is excluded , see fig .",
    "[ fig - long ] . in this case",
    ", for typical values of @xmath94 obtained in @xcite ( such as @xmath299 for their leading isometry breaking perturbation ) , the constraints from the late decays require a sufficiently small value of @xmath438 ( @xmath439 , or smaller ) , so that the abundance of the modes is strongly ( boltzmann ) suppressed ( recall that @xmath440 is required for the validity of the supergravity treatment of the throat geometry ) .",
    "otherwise , lower values of @xmath94 , or a sufficiently large compact space ( @xmath441 ) , is required for these modes to decay before bbn . in the opposite regime",
    ", the lifetime of the kk relics can be much greater than the present age of the universe .",
    "if this is the case , or if , due to selections rules , some modes are stable , one gets the right abundance for these modes to be viable cold dark matter candidates if one tunes the value of @xmath442 .",
    "this also requires a value of @xmath443 .    in our analysis , we considered the standard model degrees of freedom to be located on a probe 3-brane at the tip of the throat where the kk modes are localized .",
    "the ultimate fate of the kk relics in a given model will depend on the specific way that the standard model is realized and embedded into the internal space .",
    "furthermore , different or additional constraints may apply if the standard model degrees of freedom are located in the unwarped region of the calabi - yau or in another throat .",
    "already a displacement of the sm brane from the tip of the throat would affect the decay rate of the kk modes . in sections 5 and 6 , we only considered the probe brane to be at the tip , @xmath250 .",
    "otherwise @xmath444 , the decay time of the relic kk modes into sm particles would be much bigger , see eq .",

    "we restricted ourselves to the single throat case .",
    "the reason is related to at least two additional complications that arise if we include another throat .",
    "one complication arises for two throats with very different warpings .",
    "the physics of inflation and subsequent thermalization will corresponds to values of the hubble parameter and of the temperature which exceeds the mass of the kk modes in the long throat ( @xmath446 ) .",
    "this generates a mass gap for the kk modes .",
    "the tunneling of kk modes from the short to long throat should take this effect into consideration .",
    "as it was recently shown in @xcite , in such a scenario the standard model throat ( together with sm brane ) will be cloaked by a schwarzschild horizon , and the usual treatment of tunneling is not applicable .",
    "the second complication is even more restrictive .",
    "let us try to model the wave equation of the the angular kk modes in the bulk space between throats @xcite .",
    "since warping there is insignificant , instead of equation ( [ isophi ] ) we have [ bulk ] ( _ y^2+m_kk^2-)_m=0  , where we continue to use the `` radial '' coordinate @xmath70 ( in a loose sense ) and where @xmath447 is the eigenvalue of the laplace operator @xmath448 in the directions orthogonal to @xmath70 .",

    ", we consider the decay of a mode of mass @xmath116 into two modes of mass @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the first term in ( [ s12 ] , [ s1 ] ) gives contributions of the form [ s3 ] s_1^(3 ) d^d-4ye^2a_m_m_m ",
    "d^4x^(m ) _ _ ^(m ) _ ^^(m  )  .. in general , the @xmath70-integrals do _ not _ require the conservation of the total kk mass , @xmath482 , as would have been the case in a flat background . however , if one of the decay product is the zero - mode , @xmath215 , its wave - function is constant and goes out of the integral .",
    "the @xmath70-integrals then reduce to the orthonormal conditions ( [ orthonorm ] ) , which imposes @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , a massive kk mode ( @xmath216 ) can not decay into 2 zero modes gravitons ( @xmath483 ) , as also noticed in @xcite . here",
    "we note furthermore that a massive mode can not decay either into another massive mode plus a graviton since , for the process @xmath484 , the constraint @xmath214 is not compatible with the conservation of the 4-dimensional energy - momentum ( [ econs ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that a massive kk mode can not decay directly by 3-legs interaction into one or two zero - mode(s ) .",
    "we can check that the second term in ( [ s12 ] ) does not change these conclusions . expanding ( [ s2 ] )",
    "to third order in @xmath114 and performing integrations by part , we find after a tedious calculation [ s23 ] s_2^(3 ) & = & d^dxe^4a  .",
    "we are interested in the contribution of this expression to the process @xmath484 .",
    "there is only one possibility for the constant zero - mode in the first term , 2 in the second term and 3 in the third term .",
    "the 4-dimensional coupling constant for this process is then proportional to m_d^d-2_0d^d-4ye^4a  . by integrating the first and second terms by part , and by using the mode equation ( [ equaphi ] ) , this reduces to _ 0(m^2 + m^,2 ) d^d-4ye^2a_m_m  .",
    "which again is non - vanishing only for @xmath214 , from the orthogonal conditions ( [ orthonorm ] ) .",
    "therefore , the 3-legs decay of a massive spin 2 kk mode into 1 or 2 graviton zero - mode(s ) is not possible .",
    "we will use this in section [ sec : interactions ] when we study the possible decay channels of the kk modes .",
