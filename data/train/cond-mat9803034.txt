    "since the discovery of high @xmath8 much effort has been devoted to the study of the pairing mechanisms in highly correlated electronic systems .",
    "two very well studied microscopic models for such systems are the hubbard and @xmath9 models . while the search for superconductivity in the positive-@xmath0 hubbard model by numerical methods has failed so far @xcite , @xmath10-like models exhibit _ d_-wave superconductivity for certain parameters @xcite .",
    "although most of the high @xmath8 superconducting materials have a two - dimensional character , calculations in one dimension ( 1d ) have been very useful . in one dimension",
    "the hubbard and supersymmetric ( @xmath11 ) @xmath10 models can be exactly solved using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for this particular case of the @xmath10 model , the ground state consists of bound states with a gapless excitation spectrum , but for @xmath12 bound states exist for large enough densities @xcite .",
    "other strongly correlated models that introduce correlated hopping interactions are subject of current research [ 14 - 51 ] . in 1989 , hirsch @xcite proposed a model for the description of oxide superconductors by considering the holes in a nearly filled band as charge carriers .",
    "the hamiltonian in standard notation reads :    @xmath13    in contrast to the hubbard model , the hopping amplitude for single - particle hopping to a nearest - neighbour site depends on the occupancy of one of the sites involved in the process .",
    "a few years ago , a new integrable model of strongly correlated fermionic systems for hole superconductivity has been introduced @xcite .",
    "it is a modified version of hirsch s model ( [ eqn:1 ] ) and its hamiltonian reads :    @xmath14    in 1d , it has been solved using the bethe ansatz in three parameter regimes : @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the two first regimes are related by a particle - hole transformation and present similar behaviour to the hirsch model ( [ eqn:1 ] ) : there is a good quantitative agreement between the ground state energies , both models show gapless charge excitations and spin excitations with a finite gap for all densities and also dominating superconducting correlations for densities larger than a critical value @xcite .",
    "instead , for the case with @xmath18 , both models ( [ eqn:1 ] and [ eqn:2 ] ) behave quite differently : while the spin gap in the hirsch model vanishes and there are no indications of superconductivity , the gap remains finite and superconducting correlations are present for small doping in the bariev model ( [ eqn:2 ] ) .",
    "an important interaction that has not been considered in the above models is the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we consider a more complete hamiltonian that includes on - site @xmath0 and nearest - neighbour @xmath1 interactions between the particles , and contains a more general kinetic term with different hopping parameters , depending on the total occupation of the sites involved :    @xmath19    the model ( [ eqn:1 ] ) corresponds to taking @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the hubbard model is obtained when @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the case @xmath25 has been derived as the model that describes the low energy excitations of intermediate - valence systems @xcite and `` hole '' and cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the model with @xmath1 was obtained for cuprate superconductors @xcite and proposed to describe the benzene molecule @xcite .    for @xmath26 and @xmath27 an exact solution of ( [ eqn:3 ] ) exists in 1d @xcite , but this case is too peculiar , as discussed later .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eqn:3 ] ) supplemented by a hopping of pairs of the type @xmath28 has also been solved in 1d using bethe ansatz @xcite for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "its behaviour is similar to that of the hubbard model . for negative",
    "@xmath0 the model displays superconductivity .",
    "a more general model including this one and that of bariev for particular parameters has also been solved using bethe ansatz @xcite .    for @xmath31 the phase diagram of the model ( [ eqn:3 ] ) has been investigated previously @xcite and some exact results have been found for the half - filled system ( density of particles @xmath32 ) : a ) in any arbitrary lattice in @xmath33 dimensions with coordination number @xmath34 the ground state is a mott insulator ( mi ) with all sites singly occupied if @xmath35 @xmath36 ; b ) the ground state is a charge density wave ( cdw ) if @xmath37 ( simple cubic lattices ) ; c ) there is a region with mobile carriers which we call metallic ( m ) between these two phases , the m - mi boundary being at @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 this state is a `` non - conducting metal '' @xcite ) ; d ) for @xmath40 the m - cdw boundary is at @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 the phase diagram at @xmath32 has been studied numerically in 1d and 2d and within mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "the high spin degeneracy of the mi phase for @xmath43 is lifted and gives place to a spin density wave ( sdw ) phase .",
    "there exists a metallic phase ( the detailed nature of which will be discussed later ) for small values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which shrinks as @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 ( hubbard limit ) , several results indicate that there is no m phase , except , eventually , on the second - order transition line between the cdw and sdw phases , that ends at a tricritical point .",
    "the position of this point is , to date , not well determined and should be around @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study , by numerical and analytical methods , possible existence of superconductivity in the model ( [ eqn:3 ] ) in regions of parameters for which exact results are not available .",
    "special attention is paid to the occurrence of exotic _ p_-wave triplet superconductivity ( ts ) . in particular , we show strong evidence that the extension to finite @xmath4 of the above mentioned m phase displays ts .",
    "some evidence of triplet superconductivity exists in the extended hubbard model ( eq .  [ eqn:3 ] with @xmath47 ) very near the line @xmath48 for positive @xmath0 @xcite .    in section 2",

    "s_-wave superconductivity ( or dominant singlet superconducting correlations at large distances in 1d ) for certain parameters . at half filling we present evidence of a superconductor - insulator transition . in section 3 we explain the hf - bcs decoupling scheme and apply it to the electron - hole symmetric case @xmath7 at half filling .",
    "we obtain a phase diagram separating regions in which the stable phase is a cdw , sdw or triplet _ p_-wave superconductor ( ts ) .",

    "the meissner effect is absent .    since , due to the rather pathological degeneracy of the ground state , the exact results do not allow to draw definite conclusions for @xmath61 while the bosonization results are expected to be valid only for weak interactions , we have carried out a detailed numerical study of the model for @xmath25 in rings of 10 and 12 sites @xcite . for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and small @xmath0",
    ", there are clear indications of binding and afq ( a tendency towards a periodicity of half a flux quantum in the energy as a function of flux ) .",
    "the calculation of the correlation exponent @xmath54 indicates that superconducting correlations dominate for @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , 8 or 6.5 for @xmath68 , 0.5 or 0.6 electrons per site respectively .",

    "while the continuum limit theory predicts that the system is an insulator for all positive values of @xmath0 @xcite , we find evidence of a superconductor - insulator transition as a function of @xmath0 when @xmath74 and any sign of @xmath75 ( the sign can be changed using the symmetry properties of the model @xcite ) .",
    "this agrees with previous numerical work of @xmath76 @xcite , a bcs calculation @xcite and recent results using slave bosons @xcite . for small positive values of @xmath0",
    "we find in rings of 10 sites that the energy as a function of flux @xmath77 has a form that suggests afq for @xmath62 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , using topological quantum numbers @xcite ( as explained briefly in section 4 ) , we detect a transition from charge ( @xmath80 ) and spin ( @xmath81 ) berry phases @xmath82 to @xmath83 ( corresponding to the sdw phase ) as @xmath0 increases .",

    "a demonstration of the _ s_-wave character was provided by the results of stochastic diagonalization by michielsen and de raedt @xcite which showed the presence of singlet - singlet quasi odlro in 1d for @xmath62 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and also for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath95 ( negative-@xmath0 hubbard model ) .",

    "this decoupling leads naturally to _",

    "exact results have shown that for small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the cdw and sdw phases become unstable because the system lowers its energy taking advantage of the kinetic energy terms @xmath106 and @xmath5 , which are inactive in the cdw and sdw phases @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , a phase diagram valid for several lattices in arbitrary dimensions",
    "was constructed @xcite . for @xmath26 ,",
    "an exact solution exists in 1d @xcite , but these exact results were unable to identify the nature of the third phase for finite @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical and mean - field results @xcite show the presence of mobile carriers and a non - vanishing drude weight within the m phase in 1d and 2d , suggesting that the system is a luttinger liquid in 1d and metallic in 2d for small @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , a suggestion that this phase has dominant triplet superconducting correlations at large distances was given only recently @xcite .",
    "note that if in the three - body part of the correlated hopping ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn:3 ] ) , the operator @xmath49 is replaced by its expectation value @xmath107(assumed for this argument independent of spin and nearest - neighbour pair , as in the non - interacting case ) , this term takes the form @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the three - body term reduces to an attraction of nearest - neighbour electrons _ with the same spin _ and triplet pairing is a natural consequence of it .",
    "the hf - bcs decoupling is the most convenient mean - field approximation to reduce the many - body terms of the hamiltonian to one - body terms .",
    "it is a generalization of the procedure used by foglio and falicov for the normal case @xcite .",
    "a more direct way of obtaining the hf - bcs hamiltonian ( @xmath110 ) is to define the vacuum as the ( unknown for the moment ) slater determinant that is the ground state of @xmath110 .",
    "then one should normal order the exact hamiltonian with respect to this vacuum using wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "clearly the contractions that appear using this theorem are the hf - bcs expectation values .",
    "the exact hamiltonian takes the form of the hf - bcs ground - state energy plus normal ordered one- and many - body terms . neglecting the latter ,",
    "one obtains the hf - bcs hamiltonian .",
    "neglecting also for simplicity spin - flip expectation values of the form @xmath111 ( related to spiral spin structures ) , we obtain @xmath110 using the following approximations for the two- and three - body terms of @xmath112 :    @xmath113    @xmath114\\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath115    and the same interchanging spin up and down . choosing one spin orientation for the sake of clarity , the three - body terms are replaced as :    @xmath116.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each thermodynamic phase of the model in the hf - bcs approximation is characterized by a different symmetry breaking of the expectation values entering eqs .",
    "( 5 - 8 ) with respect to the unperturbed system .",
    "since singlet _ s_- and _ d_-wave solutions do not exist for @xmath117 @xcite , we have looked for triplet _ p_-wave superconductivity ( ts ) . based on symmetry properties expected for the ground state in 1d ( explained at the end of the next section )",
    ", we assumed that only the @xmath118 components of the triplet order parameter do not vanish like in the anderson - brinkman - model phase of superfluid @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "for this case we have @xmath120 for all @xmath121 , @xmath122 in one lattice direction and a vector @xmath123 connecting nearest - neighbours @xmath124 , while in other directions @xmath125 . as a consequence",
    "also @xmath126 depends on direction .",
    "we also considered the usual cdw and sdw phases for which the cubic lattice in d dimensions is divided into two equal interpenetrating sublattices a and b , in such a way that the nearest - neighbours of any site of a lie in b. in this case , for the sdw @xmath127 while for the cdw @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 and @xmath131 order parameters .",
    "the resulting one - particle hamiltonian has the form of the non - interacting one with a renormalized effective hopping @xmath132 , plus a symmetry breaking perturbation which , at half filling , depends on two or three parameters to be determined selfconsistently .",
    "these parameters are the corresponding order parameter ( @xmath133 , @xmath130 or @xmath134 ) and the different values of @xmath135 : one for cdw , sdw , or ts in 1d , two for ts in more than 1d ( for ts in more than 1d @xmath136 becomes anisotropic ) .",
    "the phase diagram has a natural energy scale which we call @xmath137 : the absolute value of the energy of the half - filled non - interacting case for hopping @xmath138 depends only on the dimension of the simple cubic lattice and is @xmath139 in 1d , @xmath140 in 2d , 2.005 in 3d @xcite and 0.798 in @xmath141d @xcite .",

    "these boundaries allow us to establish that , in any dimension , inside the region bounded by the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 , the ts is the stable phase .",
    "also the cdw - ts boundary lies between the dashed and dot - dashed lines of fig .",
    "1 . with an adequate change of variables",
    ", it can be shown that the self - consistency problems for the cdw and sdw take the same form on the line @xmath147 .",
    "thus , in any dimension , for @xmath148 , @xmath147 is the boundary of the cdw - sdw first - order transition , independently of the other parameters of the model .",
    "the above results are quite general and valid in any dimension .",
    "the region of stability of the ts extends always beyond the dashed lines of fig . 1 and the precise location of the boundaries of the ts depends on @xmath4 and the dimension .",
    "1 , the specific case of 1d and @xmath149 , @xmath150 is shown .",
    "the change in slope of the sdw - ts boundary is due to a metamagnetic first - order transition inside the sdw from large to small order parameter as @xmath1 increases .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the cdw - ts boundary . near the triple point , and particularly for @xmath151 , all order parameters become very small , and the numerical method used to solve the self - consistency equations breaks down .",
    "similarly , in 1d , for @xmath25 and @xmath152 , the effective hopping vanishes in the paramagnetic phase and the hf - bcs approximation becomes invalid for @xmath153 or smaller .",
    "one expects that the hf - bcs results are reliable for small values of the interactions ( small @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath154 , with @xmath149 ) and d@xmath155 , supporting the existence of the _ p_-wave ts for these parameters . in 1d",
    "there is no true lro and the hf - bcs results only have qualitative validity .",
    "a comparison with more accurate methods in 1d is made in the next section .",
    "in recent years , the concept of berry phase was a subject of great interest in a variety of fields in physics .",
    "zak has shown that it can be used for labeling energy band in solids @xcite , and subsequent work showed that changes of polarization are proportional to the corresponding change in a berry phase @xcite .",
    "ortiz and martin have generalized these concepts to a many - body ground state @xcite , and resta and sorella used this concept to identify a ferroelectric transition @xcite .",
    "this many - body berry phase is simply the phase captured by the ground state in a ring of @xmath156 sites as the boundary conditions @xmath157 @xmath158 , complete a cycle from a flux @xmath159 to @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "we call this phase the charge berry phase @xmath161 .    while previous work assumed always",
    "that the ground state is non - degenerate for all @xmath162 ( except at isolated points of the parameter space at which @xmath163 is indefinite ) , two of us have recently generalized this concept for the case in which there is a crossing of levels in the ground state as a function of @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the superconducting phases , for which there is afq as a consequence of the crossing energy levels .",
    "furthermore , a `` spin '' berry phase @xmath164 was defined as that captured by the ground state in the cycle @xmath165 varying the boundary conditions as @xmath166 with @xmath167 ( -1 ) for spin up ( down ) @xcite . due to the inversion symmetry of the model eq .",
    "( [ eqn:3 ] ) .",
    "the berry phases are quantized and in 1d can take only the values 0 and @xmath168 ( modulo @xmath169 ) .",

    "thus , this method combined with finite - size scaling is able to determine accurately the phase diagram ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the best previous numerical methods to determine phase diagrams of this type were based on the size dependence of sdw and cdw order parameters , and their probability densities in a monte carlo sampling @xcite .",
    "however , these quantities as well as different correlation functions vary smoothly at the transition and it is very difficult to obtain accurate boundaries @xcite . instead , the use of topological numbers as order parameters necessarily leads to sharp transitions .    in fig .",

    "although , as mentioned in the previous section , the hf bcs results are not expected to have quantitative validity in 1d for large values of the interaction , for small @xmath4 the resulting phase diagram is in reasonable agreement with that obtained with the above explained more reliable numerical method .",
    "the results of the latter tend to the exact phase diagram as @xmath185 .",
    "the comparison also shows that the ts phase in 1d extends beyond the expectations of the hf bcs results .",
    "this is particularly clear for @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and is probably related to the fact that , in the continuum limit theory , the backscattering and umklapp terms coming from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms of the hamiltonian ( ultimately responsible of the insulating behaviour ) , nearly cancel each other on the line @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "we should note that the method of the topological transitions alone , is not able to identify the nature of the ts phase , since different phases can have the same topological numbers .",
