    "<S> ideally , the zero phase of the reflection signal should be determined separately for each bias point by plotting @xmath67 parametrically on the smith chart and looking for the symmetry axis of the resulting circle ( see , e.g. ref . ) . we , however , did this check only at one bias point and relied that the reference phase will not change substantially . </S>",

    "<S> the gap between the ground and excited states becomes small , about @xmath69 ghz , and the upper state can either be thermally excited at our effective noise temperature of @xmath70 mk , governed by the thermalization of our circulators , or by multiphoton processes due to the microwave drive at 872 mhz . in this case , the effective inductance is a mixture of the curvatures of the two energy levels making the analysis difficult . </S>",

    "<S> well the experimental result when @xmath74 k is employed . </S>",
    "<S> the scpt behaves as a non - linear inductor whose inductance is tunable by phase bias from a few nh to infinity ( in ideal case ) . </S>",
    "<S> there exist substantial regions in the charge - phase plane where the josephson inductance takes negative values , and the negative - value regime is diminished as the charge degeneracy point is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> the current - phase relation can be obtained by integrating the inverse of josephson inductance : the relation @xmath75 yields @xmath76 where the integration constant @xmath77 must be set so that the zero level of @xmath14 is correct . </S>",
    "<S> the cprs at gate charge values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cpr ] . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that far away from the charge degeneracy point , @xmath80 , the cpr is nearly sinusoidal , while close to @xmath81 the cpr becomes strongly non - sinusoidal . </S>",
    "<S> the measured behavior at @xmath78 agrees quite well with theoretical curves calculated using @xmath82 k. the measured variation of @xmath14 with gate charge is found to be 10% stronger than what the theory predicts . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this is partially due to the uncertainty in the parameter values obtained for @xmath16 and @xmath83 using energy level spectroscopy and , moreover , to the inaccuracy in the base level of @xmath84 , which leads to an accumulation of error in the integration process .    </S>",
    "<S> excitation of the scpt from the ground state @xmath85 to the first excited level @xmath86 is another possible cause for the discrepancy between measured and calculated cprs . </S>",
    "<S> we note that if the contribution of the upper level is included in simple terms ( _ i.e. _ linear population - weighted addition of @xmath84-values of the ground and excited states ) , then the correction would even worsen the agreement between theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the contribution of the level @xmath86 is smaller than that of the ground state , leading to reduced @xmath87 and its integral . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , inclusion of even higher bands yields similar conclusions as their values for @xmath84 are also small . </S>",
    "<S> effective energy bands with stronger curvature can be obtained if one assumes that the total energy is of the form @xmath88 and that the populations @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend on @xmath4 on the time scale of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> then the derivatives of @xmath89 and @xmath90 may make substantial modifications in the inductance and , thereby , in the integrated cpr . </S>",
    "<S> for a simple description , we assume a thermal distribution at effective system temperature @xmath92 that governs the population of the upper state in the driven system according to @xmath93 where @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> below we will restrict ourselves only to a qualitative analysis by assuming that @xmath92 can be regarded as a constant fitting parameter over the region of interest , i.e. for the data measured at @xmath81 .    using this model </S>",
    "<S> , we get for the modified cpr @xmath95(bias parameter @xmath96e dropped ) @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the cpr for the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we have fitted eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ totcurr ] ) to our data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cpr ] at @xmath96 e and find an improved agreement when taking @xmath99 k ; at @xmath100 this corresponds to @xmath101 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value for @xmath92 is quite high , well above the cross - over temperature of 1e - 2e periodicity in the gate modulation of our scpt . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the bath temperature ought to be modified strongly by lz transitions caused by the measurement drive . far away from charge degeneracy , </S>",
    "<S> lz - transitions are not effective and no modification of the cpr is needed in our comparison .     </S>",
    "<S> ( strongly non - sinusoidal ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental curves are denoted by blue dots while the red solid curves display the cprs calculated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) ; the orange solid curve depicts the result calculated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ totcurr ] ) using @xmath102 k.,width=283 ]    non - sinusoidal cprs have been reported in a number of josephson junctions @xcite . however , in superconducting cooper pair transistors , where coulomb energy plays an important role , the results on ( derivatives of ) cprs have remained few and unpersuasive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> closest to our work is the @xmath0 measurement of ref . </S>",
    "<S> but their result was distinctly affected by a mixing of the ground and excited states due to nonequilibrium quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> quasiparticles were also a problem in the determination of the ground state properties of nb scpts in ref . , where 1e periodicity in @xmath103 was observed contrary to our clean 2e - periodic modulation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , born and coworkers have employed josephson inductance to characterize qubits @xcite , but their ratio of @xmath104 was too high to make observations similar to ours .    finally , we believe that our method for constructing the cpr will be useful also in studies of other exotic josephson junctions where the critical current is small , like s - carbon nanotube - s junctions @xcite . typically , critical currents in small junctions have been measured by applying current bias and recording switching current distributions @xcite . even though it is not easy to accomplish , </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently shown that switching currents can be employed to measure current - phase relations in break junction samples under circumstances where a large josephson junction is patterned in parallel with the break junction @xcite . because there is no need for an extra junction </S>",
    "<S> , we think that our scheme is better suited for investigations of novel , fragile junctions where extra lithographic steps may be problematic .    in conclusion , using the phase and magnitude of reflected microwave signals , </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally measured the josephson inductance in a mesoscopic , superconducting double - tunnel - junction device , i.e. , we have determined the quantity that is dual to the josephson capacitance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown by integrating this josephson inductance that the current - phase relation of a scpt is strongly non - sinusoidal near its charge degeneracy point and that substantial tuning by the gate voltage towards nearly sinusoidal cpr at @xmath105 can be reached .    </S>",
