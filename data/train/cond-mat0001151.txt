    "in recent years there has been a growing interest in electrostatic systems that are dominated by ion fluctuations and ion distributions around larger charged objects . in some of these systems",
    "one finds attraction between like charged objects@xcite and direct _",
    "electrostatic _ contributions in systems that are over - all _ neutral_@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will generalize some theoretical results for systems of neutral surfaces ( membranes ) that nontheless interact electrostatically via ion fluctuations and correlations .",
    "these predictions are relevant to the experimental work done both on biological systems and on artificial systems where charges are introduced in order to improve membrane characteristics .",
    "examples are the charged membranes in membrane - dna complexes@xcite used for gene transvection and the formation of equilibrium bilayer vesicles from mixed charged lipids@xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown@xcite that charge fluctuations can lead to attractions between over - all neutral surfaces .",
    "however , the system treated was the somewhat artificial case of uniform layers where the interacting surfaces separate regions of the _ same _ dielectric . in this paper",
    "we specifically focus on the role of the dielectric discontinuities in systems of lipid membranes in an aqueous solution and how they affect these interactions . in sec.[sec : 2-d ] we introduce a model system for the membrane which includes two surfaces charged with both positive and negative mobile ions ( charged lipid heads at the bilayer surface ) that are over - all neutral .",
    "the system is treated within the debye - hckel model@xcite for a two - dimensional salt solution@xcite .",
    "we calculate the interaction between these two surfaces resulting from the fluctuations and correlations of the mobile charges , and find that the resulting attraction depends in a non - trivial way on the _ dielectric discontinuity _ between lipid and water .",
    "in this section we calculate the effective interaction between two surfaces that contain mobile charges but are over - all neutral .",
    "this is a model system for mixed charged lipid membranes@xcite or for membranes that are very highly charged to the extent that their counter - ions are restricted to a near - by layer that is thin enough to be considered as a two - dimensional surface .",
    "pincus and safran @xcite have calculated this interaction within the debye - hckel approximation for a uniform system , _",
    "i.e. _ a system with no dielectric discontinuities . we will follow their method , while introducing the dielectric contributions to this model .",
    "the debye - hckel model is an expansion of the energy to second order in the charge density fluctuations@xcite and includes both the electrostatic and entropic contributions due to these fluctuations : @xmath1 \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ]    the self energy of each of the surfaces separately is given by the first two terms while the third term is the interaction term between charges on the different surfaces .",
    "@xmath2 are the charge densities on the surfaces ( the index @xmath3 denotes the surface number ) while @xmath4 is the in - plane coordinate and @xmath5 is the coordinate perpendicular to the surface . the first term ( @xmath6 function )",
    "is the entropic contribution from the charge density fluctuations in both surfaces . in this expression",
    "we have assumed , for the sake of simplicity and without taking away from the generality of the treatment , that the charge fluctuations are only due to density fluctuations of _ one _ type of charge while the other sign does not fluctuate and therefore does not contribute to the free energy to this order . thus the entropic contribution can be written in terms of the total charge density fluctuations on each surface , where @xmath7 is the average charge density of each species ( separately ) .",
    "the electrostatic contributions , @xmath8 , both between charges in the same surface ( @xmath9 ) and between charges on the opposite surfaces ( @xmath10 ) are not trivial because of the dielectric discontinuities that are formed by these surfaces ( fig 1 ) .",
    "the discontinuities reflect the fields thus creating image charges in the region outside the membrane@xcite . because this system has two such discontinuities on either side of the membrane , each image charge is reflected over and over again so that we have an infinite number of charges over which to sum when calculating the potential .",
    "we require expressions both for the interaction between charge fluctuations in the same surface ( they will also contribute to the inter - surface interaction via the reflections ) and fluctuations on opposite surfaces .",
    "the interaction potential of two charges that are in the same surface is : @xmath11        the sums in eq.[z=0 interaction ] and [ z = d interaction ] are easily performed if we use the identity @xmath17 to transform them into simple geometric series .",
    "the resulting energy in momentum space has the form :        at this point it is worth noting the differences between this expression and that which is found for the uniform case@xcite of no dielectric variations : the differences are expressed through the various effective bjerrum lengths . in the uniform case",
    "there is only one such length scale which would be equal to @xmath24 where @xmath25 . in that case",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence the differences enter not only in the way they change the interaction amplitude through @xmath28 and @xmath24 , but also by adding an additional interaction term that is @xmath16 dependent , but which is also proportional to the dielectric difference , @xmath29 , through @xmath30 , and affects the resulting interaction in a non - trivial way , as will be seen below.@xcite                  the most convenient way to analyze the results of the previous section is by looking at the various limits of the integral , eq . [ pressure integral ] .",
    "we have three dimensionless parameters that determine the behavior of this integral and thus the @xmath16 and @xmath35 dependence of the pressure .",
    "the first is the ratio between the two length scales in the problem : @xmath36 which parameterizes the strength of the charging in the membrane relative to the distance between the surfaces .",
    "the other two parameters are ratios of the dielectric constants and also their relative difference : @xmath37 the first of these two ratios reflects the effect of image charges on the fluctuation induced interactions , while the second measures the relative weakening or strengthening of the primary interactions between fluctuations on the two sides due to the difference in dielectric response of the material between them .",
    "we have three different parameters with which we find two main regimes and one sub - regime .",
    "the first regime is reached when we take the limit @xmath38 ( high ion density : the average distance between ions @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 the @xmath41 behavior remains the same throughout this regime , although the sign of the pressure changes from being attractive for @xmath42 ( as is expected for a lower dielectric between the surfaces and is the case for a biomembrane ) and even @xmath43 slightly bigger than @xmath44 , becoming repulsive only when the internal dielectric , @xmath43 is at least twice as big as the external one , @xmath44 . in this limit",
    "the effect of the variation in the dielectric between the surfaces is just on the size ( and eventually the sign ) of the pressure , but the dependence on distance is unaltered from the uniform case which was described in @xcite as a fluctuation effect and compared with the van der waals attraction also because of its linear dependence on temperature .    the next main regime is the opposite one when @xmath45 . here",
    "we distinguish between two regimes : the first is that when the dielectric contrast is not very big ( compared with @xmath46 ) and in this case the behavior is , as expected , similar to that found for the uniform case in this limit@xcite : @xmath47 in this case the pressure is inversely proportional to the temperature ( through the @xmath48 dependence ) and is argued to be a correlation , rather than a fluctuation , effect @xcite .",
    "the dielectric effects enter in the coefficient @xmath49 and reduce the interaction as the internal dielectric ( lipid ) becomes smaller then the external one ( water ) and the dielectric contrast increases .",
    "however as this contrast increases another effect becomes important : the effect of the image charges which dominate when @xmath50 is not small compared with @xmath46 , and we find : @xmath51 here once again we find that the interaction will change sign when the internal and external dielectrics reverse roles .",
    "however , the dominant effect is that the power law changes from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and therefore for smaller @xmath16 this effect becomes more important than the previous result , eq .",
    "[ small d uniform ] .",
    "note that in this regime the pressure is independent of t and is therefore neither pure fluctuation nor correlation effect .",
    "moreover , it is linearly dependent on the surface charge density , @xmath54 , ( and not quadratically ) indicating that the correlations lead to an average charge distribution which is temperature independent and the result is an interaction between each charge and its effective image charge which does not include , to first order , the rest of the mobile charges .    because the membrane thickness is typically of order @xmath55 the limit of @xmath45",
    "can only be achieved for very low charging of the membrane and in this limit it might not be strong enough to compete with the van der waals interaction ; in any case the stronger power dependence on @xmath16 might not be easy to detect .",
    "however , note that if we reverse the membrane and water roles , and we look instead at the inter - membrane interactions say in a stack , we find that this last result might be more important .",
    "because the inter - membrane distances in stacks can be relatively small this limit is easily achieved even in moderately charged membranes ( one of every 5 - 6 lipids is charged ) . because the dielectric constants are now reversed , the ratios change but we remain in this last limit where the reflections dominate the interaction .",
    "moreover , due to the reversal of the dielectrics , the interaction ( between membranes across the water ) is repulsive and therefore the interplay with the van der waals attraction becomes more interesting .",
    "it is especially meaningful in this case because unlike the lipid material in the membrane , in some experimental set - ups water can flow in and out of the stack and therefore the stack separation can be more effectively controlled by this interaction .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that fluctuation induced interactions are strongly dependent on the dielectric properties of the system not only quantitatively but also qualitatively",
    ". the lower dielectric constant of lipid will reduce the strength of the interaction between the two surfaces of the membrane but will also change the scaling with the membrane thickness .",
    "when looking at interactions in a stack the reverse happens : the interaction is enhanced by a factor of @xmath56 with respect to the uniform case and we might also be able to see the effects of dielectric reflections when looking at the inter - membrane interactions .",
