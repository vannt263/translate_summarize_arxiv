    "pulsars are fast - spinning neutron stars , with a typical mass of 1.4 - 2.0@xmath0 and radius of @xmath1 cm . the rotational period of a newborn pulsar ranges from 0.01 to 10s .",
    "pulsars are highly magnetized with magnetic field strength of the order of @xmath2 g , and emit electromagnetic radiation as beams .",
    "this beam of radiation can be observed in a pulsation which that has the same period as the rotational period of a pulsar . for an isolated pulsar ,",
    "the radiation is powered by the rotation .",
    "as the rotational energy is eventually consumed , the spin period increases steadily .",
    "this spin - down rate is very small .",
    "the typical value is @xmath3 s s@xmath4 for a young pulsar ( e.g. the crab pulsar ) , corresponding to an increase of 0.001s after one million years .",
    "although every pulsar decelerates through radiation , it is not rare to observe pulsars that experience spin - up . glitches are internal processes that generate a sudden jump in the rotational period of a pulsar .",
    "the exact causes and processes of a glitch are not yet fully understood . currently , there are two common proposed models : superfluidity and starquake .",
    "the superfluid model , first predicted by packard ( 1972 ) , suggests that the structure of the pulsar is composed of normal matter and superfluid components .",
    "occasionally , the superfluid component may couple with the normal matter , causing a transfer of angular momentum to the surface of the pulsar , which increases the observed frequency immediately .",
    "another explanation for the glitch is the starquake model , which was first discussed by ruderman ( 1969 ) after the first glitches in the crab and vela pulsars were observed . in this model , it is predicted that when a pulsar spins down , the geometrical shape deforms from oblate toward spherical . since the crust is solid , such deformation accumulates stress in the crust .",
    "when the stress is beyond the maximum shear strain that can be supported , the crust cracks and causes a slight change in the shape of the pulsar , and hence the moment of inertia .",
    "as the angular momentum is conserved , the pulsar spins up when the moment of inertia is reduced .",
    "espinoza ( 2011 ) reported their analysis on 315 glitches observed in the rotation of 102 pulsars .",
    "they found that glitches are most extensive in young pulsars with a characteristic age @xmath5kyr .",
    "the crab pulsar , which is the youngest pulsar in their study , experienced a relatively small glitch size ( @xmath6 ) but the largest @xmath7 among the samples .",
    "this small glitch size is more likely to be explained by the starquake model , while for pulsars with larger glitch sizes like the vela pulsar , having @xmath8 , the explanation has to be obtained with the superfluid model .    in this study",

    "they found that the glitch happened near mjd 55850 ( 2011 october 16 ) with a timescale smaller than a week .",
    "the change occurred in four aspects ( flux , spin - down rate , pulse profile , and spectrum ) simultaneously .",

    "it is found that the cut - off energy ( @xmath30 ) decreases by @xmath31 in the glitch .",
    "there is also a slight decrease in the integrated energy flux in the energy range between 100 mev and 300 gev .",
    "the phase - resolved spectral analysis also revealed that the major variation in the emission spectrum of psr  j2021 + 4026 results from the first major peak ( p1 ) of the pulsed signal .",
    "the phase - resolved spectrum in the region of p1 experienced a significant drop in the cut - off energy ( @xmath30 ) of @xmath32 after the glitch .",
    "the authors hypothesized that these sudden changes originate from the reconfiguration of magnetic field on the pulsar surface .    in our study ,",
    "the gamma - ray emission of psr  j2021 + 4026 was re - analyzed , using data of longer length and an updated version of the _ fermi _ science tools .",

    "( 2013 ) . from the long - term tracking on the flux emitted from psr",
    "j2021 + 4026 , we found that the drop caused by the glitch is a permanent effect .",
    "in particular , we present the findings from the flux evolution throughout the seven years after the launch of the _ fermi_.      the gamma - ray flux emitted by psr  j2021 + 4026 over seven years since the start of _ fermi _ mission is analyzed . the data between 2008 august 04 and 2015 august 12 were used .",
    "the events in the pass 8 `` source '' class were selected and the corresponding instrumental response functions for this event class is the p8r2_source_v6 .",

    "the seven - year time interval is binned and the flux from the target pulsar in each time bin is computed .",
    "both steps involve the binned likelihood analysis performed using the _ fermi _ science tools version v10r0p5 .    in the first step ,",
    "the background emission was analyzed using the data over the entire period ( @xmath37 yr ) .",

    "the input model is the best - fit model with fixed spectral indices from the analysis of the entire seven - years data in the first step . in each time bin ,",
    "binned likelihood analysis was performed to obtain the normalization constants in the model and to estimate the photon flux of each source included in the model .",
    "the photon flux of psr  j2021 + 4026 was then obtained .",

    "the blue dashed lines represent the mean fluxes within three separate intervals : ( 1 ) before mjd 55850 , ( 2 ) between mjd 55850 and 57000 , and ( 3 ) beyond mjd 57000 . as indicated in the light curves , there is a sudden and significant drop ( @xmath43 ) in the photon flux around mjd 55850 .",
    "there could also be hints of a second glitch around mjd 57000 in which the flux has experienced another jump with a smaller glitch size .",
    "although we speculate that this could be a second glitch for this pulsar , we can not confirm it at this moment because we have not obtained the timing parameters beyond mjd 56580 .",
    "also , the phase - averaged spectral analysis using data over eight months , which produces a relatively large uncertainty , does not guarantee a change .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we only discuss the details of the first glitch .",
    "as it can be seen from figure  [ fig : lc30day ] , the flux level between the two jumps is steady and shows no hint of gradual recovery .",
    "therefore , we regarded the first jump in flux as a permanent effect by the glitch in mjd 55850 .",
    "in this section , we will use a theoretical model to simulate the gamma - ray emissions from psr  j2021 + 4026 and explain the cause and the consequences of the glitch that occurred around 2011 october 16 . from the _",
    "fermi_-lat observations reported in allafort et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the emission of psr  j2021 + 4026 exhibits widely separated double peaks connected with a strong bridge , a spectral cut - off at high energy ( @xmath44 gev ) and a high integrated energy flux .",
    "these characteristic properties favor the outer gap model ( cheng et al .",
    ", 1986a , 1986b ) .",
    "hence , this study adopts the outer gap model in simulating the radiation of psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "in particular , we will use the three - dimensional two - layer outer gap model , which is a more realistic outer gap model that considers the development and the closure of the outer gap by photon - photon pair creation ( wang et al .",
    "the details of the three - dimensional two - layer outer gap model are described in wang et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "we will then use the crust cracking scenario to understand the glitch behavior of psr  j2021 + 4026 in section  [ section : crustcrack ] .      in this section ,",
    "the possible cause of the glitch in psr  j2021 + 4026 around 2011 october 16 will be discussed . from the gamma - ray observation described in section  [ section : observation ] , the 7 years light curve shows that the photon flux of the pulsar experienced a permanent decrease after the glitch . to produce a permanent change ,",
    "the crust crack mechanism is preferred to the superfluid coupling .",
    "this is because the pulsar will gradually recover to its original condition after the glitch caused by superfluid .",
    "we propose that the crust cracking scenario leads to a change in the magnetic inclination angle , and thus the observed consequences of the glitch in psr  j2021 + 4026 .      when link et al .",
    "( 1992 ) studied the glitch of the crab pulsar that occurred in 1975 , they found that the superfluid model could not explain the persistent change in the spin - down rate .",
    "they proposed that there must be an excess external torque that is a result of the rearrangement of the surface magnetic field .",
    "the surface magnetic field is rearranged through the plate tectonic activity ( ruderman 1991 ) . in the plate tectonic model ,",
    "the structure of a pulsar consists of an upper crust , a lower crust , and a core .",
    "the thickness of the solid crust is @xmath45 cm .",
    "neutron superfluid vortex lines build up shear stresses in the crust lattices of the spinning pulsar .",
    "this stress will break the crust and move the crustal plates toward the equator . since the surface magnetic field lines are localized and pinned to the plates , they move along with the plates . as a result ,",
    "the dipole moment of the pulsar is more deviated from the rotational axis , thus increasing the magnetic inclination angle . in the case study of the crab pulsar by link et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , they found that a change in the inclination angle @xmath46 could reproduce the observed offset in the spin - down rate @xmath47 .      one main approach to describe the magnetosphere of pulsars is by solving equations for magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in the force - free limit , where the forces in the plasma are balanced ( i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the charge and current densities , respectively ) . the equations for mhd are derived from the maxwell equations in special relativity with the imposed force - free conditions .",
    "spitkovsky ( 2006 ) solved the mhd equations numerically using a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) approach to investigate the evolution of pulsar magnetospheres . from the numerical solutions ,",
    "it is found that for a pulsar having an inclination angle between the magnetic and the rotational axes , the spin - down luminosity can be formulated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the best - fit coefficients from the numerical results .",
    "considering the outer gap model as a small perturbation of the force - free model , we adopted this relationship . using @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the moment of pulsar s inertia",
    ", we found that the relative change in the spin - down rate ( @xmath56 ) can be expressed as a function of the inclination angle ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 in this way , a shifting in the inclination angle can lead to a change in the spin - down rate of the pulsar . in the case of psr  j2021",
    "+ 4026 , since the spin - down rate is increased after the glitch , we expect there to be an increase in the inclination angle .      because of the rearrangement of surface magnetic fields due to crust plate activities , it is expected that the emission geometry is affected .",
    "the observed pulse profile can be interpreted as the pattern of magnetic field lines viewed at a fixed viewing angle @xmath59 , which is the angle between the rotational axis of the pulsar and the observer .",
    "higher flux is observed at the positions with higher magnetic field line densities .",
    "this is because the density of the magnetic field line corresponds to the field strength .",
    "if the magnetic field is stronger , the charged particles are accelerated to higher speeds and emit more energetic curvature photons .",
    "the secondary pair creation and acceleration also contribute to the high flux observed .",
    "when the inclination angle is changed , leading to an adjustment in the magnetic field line pattern , the observed pulse profile will be modified .",
    "another consequence is the shift in the spectral cut - off energy . as discussed in section  [ subsection : spindownangle ] , the inclination angle of psr  j2021 + 4026 is expected to increase after the glitch .",
    "when the inclination angle increases , the line of sight from the observer will cut the magnetic field lines at an angle closer to the polar region .",
    "therefore , the inner magnetosphere will be viewed . since the charged particles are accelerated through the outer gap toward the light cylinder , the curvature photons from the inner part have less energy than the outer region . as a result ,",
    "the observed emission with increased inclination angle generally has lower energy .",
    "thus , the spectral cut - off energy is shifted to a smaller value .",
    "we used the three - dimensional two - layer outer gap model described in wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to simulate the high - energy emission from psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "it is found that the model could not reproduce the widely separated peaks and high energy flux shown in the observation simultaneously .",
    "this is because a larger peak separation requires a thinner gap but a thinner gap will result in a lower spectral energy flux . to preserve both properties , we introduced an extra parameter to increase the energy in the emission spectrum such that a thinner gap can be applied .",
    "takata & chang ( 2009 ) modeled the dependency between the maximum accelerating electric field in the outer gap structure and the size of the polar cap .",
    "it is found that the typical strength of the accelerating electric field is proportional to the square of the polar cap size .",
    "here , we used an enlargement factor to amplify the size of the polar cap .",
    "in this way , both the peak separation and the high - energy emission spectrum can be retained .",
    "we chose the factor to be @xmath60 .",
    "the observation on psr  j2021 + 4026 shows that the pulsar releases strong off - pulse emission , which is difficult to explain by traditional outer gap model . in order to produce the off - pulse emission ,",
    "the outer gap is extended towards the stellar surface , until a limit called the inner boundary ( dyks & rudak 2003 ; dyks et al .",
    "2004 and takata et al .",
    "also , the viewing angle is required to be close to @xmath61 in order to observe the off - pulse emissions . in this study ,",
    "the inner boundary was chosen to be located at the height of @xmath62 times the distance between the stellar surface and the null charge surface , where @xmath63 is the outer gap fraction defined in wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    in this section , the results will be presented . in particular , the pulse profile ( in the full energy band and in separate energy bins ) and spectra",
    "( phase - averaged and phase - resolved ) before and after the glitch will be discussed .      in the model ,",
    "the pulsar psr  j2021 + 4026 has a surface magnetic field of @xmath64 g at the poles , a rotational period of @xmath65  s and a distance of @xmath66 kpc away from the earth .",

    "( 2011 ) . @xmath57 and @xmath59 are determined from the pulse profile that resembles the geometry of the magnetic field structure of a rotating dipole .",
    "other parameters characterize the strength of the accelerating electric potential in the outer gap and thus the energy of the radiated curvature photons .    to test the crust cracking scenario on this pulsar glitch",
    ", we first obtained the set of parameters based on the observed pulse profile and spectrum .",
    "then , we increased the value of the inclination angle @xmath57 until there is no bump in the bridge emission of the pulse .",
    "the value of the viewing angle @xmath59 does not change after glitch because it is the angle between the rotational axis and the observer , which is fixed with time .",
    "since we intend to explain the glitch by the change in the inclination angle , other parameters involved in the distributions of the gap structure are assumed to be unchanged to reduce the number of free parameters and the complexity of the scenario . from the relation between the change in the spin - down rate and the inclination angle discussed in section  [ subsection : spindownangle ] , we can estimate @xmath75 from the observed @xmath47 .",
    "using equation  [ equation : sdinclination ] , the observed value of @xmath76 and the modeled value of @xmath77 before the glitch , we obtained the expected change in the inclination angle during the glitch to be @xmath78 .",

    "the model was computed by the same method as described in section  [ section : dataanalysis ] . as seen in the pulse profile ,",
    "the bump between the double peaks is a result of the outer gap geometry in the model , which states there is a local maximum in the magnetic field line density between the two peak emission regions .",

    "this corresponds to the vanish of the bump as seen in the gamma - ray observation .",

    "the off - pulse emission is generally consistent with the observed data .",

    "the current model did not give a well - fit spectrum for the bridge emission .",
    "this is because the phase interval for br is the narrowest among the four stages so that errors are accumulated most easily .",

    "indeed , the energy flux of p2 at higher energy @xmath97 is slightly enhanced .",
    "we re - analyzed the _ fermi_-lat data by using a data length of seven years and an energy range from @xmath98 mev to @xmath98 gev .",
    "it is found that the flux of psr  j2021 + 4026 experienced two jumps separated by more than three years . in the first jump ,",
    "the flux was decreased by @xmath43 and it shows no hint of recovery .",
    "therefore , we regarded the flux change as a permanent effect of the glitch .",
    "although we speculate the second jump to be caused by another glitch , it can not be confirmed at this moment .",
    "concerning the first glitch , we proposed the crust cracking scenario to explain the glitch event , in which we assumed that the glitch was caused by plate tectonic activity .",
    "the magnetic field lines frozen on the surfaces were carried by the movement of these plates , resulting in the change of the magnetic inclination angle .",
    "this variation in the inclination angle will have an effect on the spin - down rate of the pulsar , the pulse pattern as seen by the observer , and the characteristic energy of the photons viewed at a constant line of sight .",
    "we modeled the pulse profile and spectra of psr  j2021 + 4026 using the three - dimensional two - layer outer gap model and simulate the glitch effect by imposing an increase in the inclination angle . in the model parameters ,",
    "the inclination angle is increased by @xmath99 , which is consistent with what we expect from the relation to the observed increase in the spin - down rate .",
    "other parameters are fixed for the purpose of model simplification and control .",
    "we generated the pulse profiles , in both energy integrated and energy dependent , and the spectra , in both phase - averaged and phase - resolved , for psr  j2021 + 4026 .",
    "we found from the pulse profiles that the bump disappearance can be explained .",
    "we also found that the spectral cut - off is decreased most significantly in the pulse phase interval p1 .",
    "we argued from the azimuthal distributions of the electrical properties in the interval of p1 that the size of the outer gap in the region of p1 is significantly reduced after the glitch , leading to a weaker electrical acceleration of the charged particles .",
    "moreover , the ratio between the sizes of the acceleration and the screening regions is also reduced , which results in the relatively greater reduction in the high - energy photons at gev .",
    "these conditions together reproduced the observed drop in the spectral cut - off energy .",
    "we express our appreciation to an anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions .",
