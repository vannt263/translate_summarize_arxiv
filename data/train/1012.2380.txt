    "the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite , defined in 1952 , is a lattice model for classical magnetism . since the 1970 s",
    ", it has been used as a laboratory to develop theoretical methods of statistical mechanics , such as kramers - wannier duality , yang - baxter integrability , bethe ansatz@xcite , coulomb - gas formalism@xcite , conformal field theory@xcite ( cft ) .",
    "most studies on the potts model deal with the _ ferromagnetic _ critical point , described by a coulomb - gas cft or minimal cft at the rational values .",
    "in contrast , the present review is concerned with the _ antiferromagnetic _ ( af ) regime of the potts model , which also contains exactly solvable critical points .",
    "although it is based on the same simple lattice model , this regime exhibits interesting physical features .",
    "indeed , non - unitarity of the equivalent vertex model allows a cft with central charge @xmath1 , and non - compact degrees of freedom .",
    "let us introduce the subject with a short historical notice .",
    "in 1982 , baxter first discovered@xcite the location of the af / paramagnetic transition by a mapping to a staggered integrable six - vertex ( 6v ) model , and calculated the free energy density . later on , saleur described@xcite the complete phase diagram for @xmath2 , emphasing the role of the beraha numbers @xmath3 for integer @xmath4 .",
    "at these values , he gave@xcite the cft description of the af / paramagnetic transition , relating it to the @xmath5 parafermion cft@xcite .",
    "this transition corresponds to a staggered integrable model , but it appeared@xcite as a solution of the basic yang - baxter equations ( ybe ) for the @xmath6 potts model . a complete cft description of this transition for both generic and beraha @xmath0 was achieved@xcite , especially through the study of the bethe ansatz equations : it consists in one compact boson @xmath7 with @xmath0-dependent radius and one non - compact boson @xmath8 . besides the isotropic critical regimes mentioned so far , a mixed ferro - antiferromagnetic anisotropic regime was defined and solved@xcite .",
    "its continuum limit consists in two compact bosons : @xmath7 with a @xmath0-dependent radius , and @xmath8 with a fixed radius , such that @xmath8 decomposes into two ising models .",
    "this review is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : potts ] is a reminder on the potts model and its phase diagram for generic @xmath2 , and describes some related problems relevant to statistical mechanics , but also condensed matter theory .",
    "there are three critical regimes for the potts model with af interactions . in section  [ sec : approach ] , we summarize the methods used to study the critical points of the potts model for generic values of @xmath0 . sections  [ sec : bk ] , [ sec : paf ] , [ sec : paf - or ] then apply these methods respectively to the bk phase , the af transition line and the anisotropic critical regime .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes by mentioning some aspects that are not treated in detail by this review , together with some interesting open problems .",
    "let @xmath9 be a planar lattice .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model on @xmath9 consists of spins @xmath10 living on the vertices of @xmath9 , and taking the values @xmath11 .",
    "the boltzmann weight for a spin configuration is @xmath12 = \\exp \\left (      j \\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle } \\delta_{s_i , s_j }    \\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 stands for the kronecker symbol and the product is on all edges of @xmath9 .",

    "the graphical expansion of the partition sum gives the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) cluster model@xcite ( see fig  [ fig : fk ] ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of connected components ( clusters ) of the subgraph @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the number of edges in @xmath17 . in this representation",
    ", @xmath0 plays the role of a real parameter , and we are mainly concerned with the regime @xmath2 . using euler s relation , the partition sum can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lattice dual to @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to the transformation   as kramers - wannier duality .",
    "the fk model can be , in turn , mapped to a loop model based on the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra@xcite ( see fig  [ fig : fk ] ) .",
    "the tl loop model lives on the medial lattice @xmath21 consisting of the midpoints of the original lattice @xmath9 .",
    "a cluster configuration defines uniquely a loop configuration , by asking loops to separate direct and dual clusters .",
    "we have the relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of closed loops in @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the number of medial sites where the loops do not cross the original edge of @xmath9 .",
    "although the potts model can be defined on any planar lattice , we restrict the subsequent discussion to the square lattice for simplicity .    consider the potts model on a strip on width @xmath26 sites ( with @xmath26 even ) , with coupling constant @xmath27 for horizontal edges , @xmath28 for vertical edges , and corresponding weights @xmath29 in the loop model .",

    "the three isotropic critical regimes are shown in fig .",

    ", one can relate the potts model to various statistical models through exact equivalences .",

    "so the continuum limit of the uniform spanning tree problem@xcite is determined by the ferromagnetic potts transition at @xmath48 . *",
    "* spanning forests .",
    "* in the vicinity of @xmath49 , one can define another limit : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is constant .",
    "using the same arguments as above , we get the limit : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of spanning forests@xcite on @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ spanning subgraphs with no internal face",
    ". the parameter @xmath51 thus plays the role of a tree fugacity in the spanning forest problem .",
    "the phase diagram of the potts model predicts@xcite the behavior of spanning forest as a function of @xmath51 : if @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the model is not critical ( paramagnetic phase ) ; if @xmath56 , the model is described by a coulomb - gas theory ( bk phase ) ; exactly at @xmath57 , the model is described by an @xmath58 supersphere @xmath59-model@xcite . * * restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models . * at the beraha numbers @xmath60 with integer @xmath61 , the tl generators can be represented as local operators in the @xmath62 rsos height model@xcite . the latter consists of local variables @xmath63 subject to the local constraints @xmath64 the operators @xmath31 are defined as @xmath65 the rsos model may describe the statistics of a two - dimensional interface in three - dimensional space .",
    "a second approach is to take the very anisotropic limit @xmath66 , where the transfer matrix . ]",
    "generates a local one - dimensional quantum hamiltonian based on the @xmath30 algebra , with @xmath67 .",

    "one may extract from the bae two types of data which are relevant to the associated critical theory :    * the physical properties of elementary excitations ( particle - hole excitations in the root distribution ) are derived easily by fourier transform .",
    "this leads to the scattering theory of these quasi - particles both at criticality and in the vicinity of the critical point . *",

    "the @xmath0-state potts model is a simple lattice model , in which the ferromagnetic critical point provides a basic realization of minimal cfts . the antiferromagnetic part of its phase diagram has been less studied than the ferromagnetic one , but it contains three critical regimes of physical interest for statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory . in this review , we have shown that , through an equivalence to loop and vertex models , these critical points can be solved by bethe ansatz . this approach is powerful enough to discover the cft spectrum , the @xmath140-matrix description of quasi - excitations , and also the critical exponents in the original statistical model .",
    "most of the material exposed in this review is valid for generic values of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is a beraha number ( @xmath329 , with @xmath4 integer ) , the potts model can be mapped to an rsos height model ( see section  [ sec : related ] ) . although the partition functions of the two models are identical ( even at the lattice level ) , the excitation spectra can be very different .",
    "the essential mechanism at play is that some excited states of the vertex model have a vanishing contribution to the rsos partition function . in the cft language ,",
    "the elimination of these states amounts to _ null - state equations _ , which are the basis for the determination of minimal series of cfts .",
    "rsos models with homogeneous boltzmann weights ( corresponding to the self - dual potts model ) were shown to have four different physical phases i , ii , iii , iv , with critical transitions separating phases iii - iv and i - ii .",
    "these two transitions are lattice realizations of the minimal and @xmath5-parafermionic ( for @xmath330 ) cfts , respectively@xcite .",
    "back to the potts model with beraha values , this tells us that the rsos version of the ferromagnetic critical point relates to a minimal cft , whereas that of the bk phase relates to the @xmath5-parafermionic cft .",
    "the question of the rsos version for the af critical line is more difficult , but it has been found recently@xcite that this is also described by the @xmath5-parafermionic cft . this relation is supported by the study of critical exponents and of the algebra of chiral currents .",
    "although the critical phases of the antiferromagnetic potts model are now identified and well studied , there remain interesting open questions to the mathematical physicist .    from the point of view of integrable models ,",
    "the understanding of the @xmath197 model would be more complete if one could extend the relation to braiding algebras ( see section  [ sec : q - zero ] ) . also , an analytic derivation of the effective coupling constant for the non - compact boson should be possible .",
    "moreover , one can generalize the @xmath197 construction to a @xmath331 six - vertex model , where the @xmath331 symmetry will be reflected in the whole bethe - ansatz structure .",
    "this opens a new series of models , similarly to what appears in the fusion procedure .    finally , the potts model is a good framework to study the physics of cluster or spin interfaces in lattice models .",
    "current studies focus on the links between boundary cft , schramm - lwner evolution ( sle ) and free massless field theories . in the case of the antiferromagnetic potts model ,",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn cluster boundaries are well described by the @xmath173-leg watermelon exponents , all related to the first boson @xmath7 , but the geometric expression of the second boson @xmath8 is lacking .",
    "this additional degree of freedom may lead to an extended version of the sle process , as was introduced recently@xcite .",
