    "while a higgs boson with a mass smaller than @xmath2  tev can be found at the lhc , precise and model - independent measurements of its quantum numbers and couplings can be gained from the @xmath3 linear collider .",
    "a crucial prediction of the higgs mechanism is that the higgs yukawa coupling to quarks @xmath4 is related to the quark masses by @xmath5 . at the @xmath3 linear collider",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling can be measured from top quark pair production associated with a higgs boson , @xmath0 , since the process is dominated by the amplitudes describing higgs radiation off the @xmath6 pair .",
    "this process is particularly suited for a light higgs boson since the cross section can then reach the @xmath2-@xmath7  fb level .",

    "on the other hand , the @xmath6 invariant mass @xmath11 approaches @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the top quark pair is nonrelativistic in its own center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system . because the higgs is very narrow for a mass below the @xmath14 threshold ,",
    "strong interactions between the @xmath6 pair and the hadronic higgs final state can be neglected .",

    "this singularity structure is most easily visible in the higgs energy distribution , @xmath21 .",
    "while the born distribution approaches zero for @xmath22 , @xmath23  @xcite , the @xmath8 fixed - order perturbative corrections are proportional to @xmath19 at the endpoint  @xcite and the @xmath24 corrections even diverge like @xmath25 .",

    "the curves show the typical behavior of the prediction of the nonrelativistic expansion for any choice of parameters .",
    "while the ll predictions have a quite large renormalization parameter dependence at the level of several tens of percent , the nll results are stable . here , the variation due to change of the renormalization parameter is around 5% .",
    "the stabilization with respect to renormalization parameter variations at nll order arises mainly from the inclusion of the @xmath8 qcd corrections to the coulomb potential , eq.([vcoulomb ] ) .",
    "moreover , the nll curves lie considerably lower than the ll ones .",
    "this behavior is well known from the predictions for @xmath15 at threshold  @xcite and originates from the structure of the large negative @xmath8 qcd corrections to the coulomb potential , eq.([vcoulomb ] ) , and from the sizeable negative qcd corrections to the matching conditions in eq.([matchcond ] ) .    in principle",
    "this behavior is a point of concern because it could indicate that the renormalization parameter variation might be an inadequate method to estimate theoretical uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , the top quark mass is sufficiently large such that the regions where the conventional fixed - order expansion ( in powers of the strong coupling ) and where the nonrelativistic expansion ( described by the effective theory ) can be applied are expected to overlap . to demonstrate this issue",

    "the two @xmath8 curves correspond to the renormalization scales @xmath83 ( lower curves ) and @xmath93 ( upper curves ) , where @xmath20 is the @xmath6 relative velocity defined below eq.([a2def ] ) .",
    "the latter choice for the fixed - order renormalization scale is motivated by the fact that the relative momentum of the top pair is the scale governing the coulomb singularities contained in the fixed - order expansion close to the large higgs energy endpoint .",
    "this choice for the fixed - order renormalization scale is therefore the more appropriate one near the higgs energy endpoint .",
    "the results in figs .",

    "( the higgs energy with @xmath89 is indicated in each panel by the solid vertical line . )",
    "the overlap improves for increasing c.m.energies or decreasing higgs masses .",
    "this indicates that in the overlap regions the higher order contributions summed in the nonrelativistic prediction and the higher order relativistic corrections contained in the fixed - order result are both small .",
    "for smaller c.m.energies or increasing higgs masses , on the other hand , the nll nonrelativistic predictions tend to lie slightly above the @xmath8 fixed - order results ( for @xmath86 ) illustrating the impact of the higher order corrections to each type of expansion .",
    "the discrepancy , however , remains comparable to the uncertainties estimated from the renormalization parameter variation of the nll nonrelativistic prediction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the renormalization parameter variation of the nll order nonrelativistic prediction should provide a realistic estimate of the theoretical uncertainties in the large higgs energy region .",
    "the results in figs.[fig3 ] also demonstrate that the region of parameter space where the top quark pair is nonrelativistic increases for smaller c.m.energies ( or larger higgs masses ) .",
    "let us now discuss the numerical impact of the nonrelativistic contributions in the large higgs energy region on the total cross section . in tab.[tab3 ]",
    "the importance of the summation of the coulomb singularities and the logarithms of the top quark velocity is analyzed numerically for various choices of the c.m.energy and the higgs mass .",

    "the numbers for @xmath84 , which are determined from combining the nll nonrelativistic predictions in the higgs energy end point for @xmath87 with the fixed - order @xmath8 prediction for smaller higgs energies with @xmath94 , represent the currently most complete predictions for the total cross section of the process @xmath0 as far as qcd corrections are concerned .",
    "for @xmath84 we have also given our estimate for the theoretical error .",

    "for the numbers displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] both uncertainties were added linearly .",
    "the results show that the enhancement of the cross section due to the summations in the large higgs energy region is particularly important for smaller c.m.energies and larger higgs masses , when the portion of the phase space where the nonrelativistic expansion has to be applied is large . here",
    ", the higher order summations contained in the nonrelativistic expansion can be comparable to the already sizeable @xmath8 fixed - order corrections and enhance the cross section further .",
    "this is advantageous for top yukawa coupling measurements for the lower c.m.energies accessible in the first phase of the ilc experiment . for higher c.m.energies",
    "the effect of the nonrelativistic summations of contributions from beyond @xmath8 is less pronounced and decreases to the one - percent level for c.m.energies above @xmath99  gev .",
