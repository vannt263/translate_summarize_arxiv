    "the absolute intensity of the 247-kev @xmath10-ray transition that depopulates this state is 97% , with no other peak ( intensity threshold @xmath118 below 1  mev ) in the delayed @xmath10-ray spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "however , as noted earlier , only tentative @xmath81 spin and parity have been proposed for this 247-kev level , since the low statistics of the measurement does not rule out the presence of higher - energy @xmath10 rays feeding the 247-kev level from potential higher - lying @xmath81 states .",
    "the shell model results with the gxpf1 interaction support the notion that the primary branching in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1ca is to the first excited @xmath81 in @xmath1sc .",
    "the experimental delayed - neutron branching reported in table [ tab3 ] for @xmath1ca is governed by the lower limit of the absolute intensity of the 247-kev @xmath10 ray .",
    "the @xmath0-decay properties of @xmath49ca were found to be similar to the shell model results , as was the case with @xmath119ca .",
    "the decays are dominated by fast ground state to ground state transitions , which carry more than 90% of the @xmath0-decay strength . since only a small number of decays were detected for both @xmath3ca and @xmath5ca , there was little possibility to observe branching to excited states in the @xmath3sc and @xmath5sc daughters , respectively , that would lead to @xmath10-ray or neutron emission .",
    "the short half - life values and large , direct ground - state @xmath0 branching again reflect the dominance of the spin - flip @xmath120 decay process in the shell model results . the good agreement between the experimental and shell model half - lives for @xmath49ca support the notion that the @xmath34 orbital is near the fermi surface for these nuclides with @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath0-decay properties of the neutron - rich ca isotopes have been extended to @xmath5ca@xmath39 . the half - lives of @xmath44ca have been measured for the first time to be @xmath76  ms , @xmath90  ms , and @xmath93  ms , respectively . a new half - life of @xmath57  ms has been deduced for @xmath8ca , a value longer than that reported previously .",
    "the trend of the @xmath0-decay half - lives of the neutron - rich ca isotopes shows a regular decrease except at @xmath30ca@xmath36 , which is attributed to the known subshell closure at @xmath13 .",
    "the low - energy structure of @xmath1sc , the @xmath0-decay daughter of @xmath1ca , has been elucidated further .",
    "the ground and first excited states most likely arise from coupling of the @xmath97 and @xmath33 orbitals , suggesting that the @xmath33 single - particle orbital resides below the @xmath34 state at @xmath122 .",
    "such level ordering was also inferred from the low - energy structure of the @xmath122 isotone @xmath3ti @xcite . the first @xmath81 level in @xmath1sc has been proposed at an energy of 247 kev above the ground state .",
    "this tentative @xmath81 level is presumed to be a member of the @xmath123 multiplet , and is nearly 800  kev lower than shell model predictions with the gxpf1 and gxpf1a effective interactions .",
    "it seems that the effective energy gap between adjacent neutron single - particle orbitals @xmath94 and @xmath95 is overestimated or the interaction strength between the @xmath97 and @xmath34 orbitals is underestimated by the gxpf1 interaction .",
    "the fast @xmath0 decays of @xmath49ca agree within a factor of two with the shell model results , where the @xmath0 strength is dominated by the @xmath120 spin - flip decay .",
    "the shell model prediction for the half - life of @xmath1ca is also within a factor of two of experiment .",
    "such good agreement may initially invoke support for a shell closure at @xmath37 , since the gxpf1 interaction includes a significant energy gap between adjacent single - particle orbitals @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "however , the @xmath1ca half - life is also found to agree well with the predictions of gross @xmath0 decay theory and the results of qrpa calculations , which do not formally consider a strong shell gap at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , any interpretation regarding magicity at @xmath1ca@xmath99 will require further experimental investigation .",
    "exploring the @xmath0-decay properties of heavier ca isotopes towards @xmath55ca will prove challenging due to low production cross sections .",
    "however , such studies are vital to better understand the evolution of neutron single - particle states with an increase in isospin and corresponding decrease in neutron separation energy .",
    "the authors thank the nscl operations staff for providing the primary and secondary beams for this experiment and members of the nscl gamma group for assistance in setting up and maintaining the ge detectors .",
