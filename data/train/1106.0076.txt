    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-adic field , i.e. , a finite extension of @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the ring of integers of @xmath1 . for an integer @xmath5 , we consider the universal deformation space of formal @xmath4-modules of height @xmath6 .",
    "it is called the lubin - tate space . by adding drinfeld level structures",
    ", we get a tower of affine formal schemes over the lubin - tate space , which is called the lubin - tate tower .",
    "let @xmath7 be a non - negative integer . using the @xmath7th compactly supported cohomology of the rigid generic fiber of the lubin - tate tower",
    ", we obtain a representation @xmath8 of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the central division algebra over @xmath1 with invariant @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes the weil group of @xmath1 ( for the construction of @xmath8 , see section [ sec : lubin - tate ] ) .",
    "the representation @xmath8 is very interesting ; in fact , it is known that for a supercuspidal representation @xmath13 of @xmath14 the @xmath13-isotypic component of the virtual representation @xmath15 can be described by the local langlands correspondence and the local jacquet - langlands correspondence .",
    "this was known as non - abelian lubin - tate theory or the conjecture of deligne - carayol ( @xcite ) , and proved by harris and taylor @xcite .",
    "the proof of harris and taylor was accomplished by global methods ; they related the lubin - tate tower to the bad reduction of certain shimura varieties , and deduced the non - abelian lubin - tate theory from the global theory of shimura varieties and automorphic representations .",
    "although local study of the shimura varieties at bad primes plays very important role in @xcite , they do not consider the lubin - tate tower directly ; their local study is mainly on the igusa variety , which is in some sense `` vertical '' to the lubin - tate tower .    on the other hand , for the action of @xmath14 and @xmath16 ,",
    "there is a purely local study by strauch @xcite .",
    "inspired by a pioneering work of faltings @xcite , he investigated the virtual representation @xmath17 as a @xmath18-module by using the lefschetz trace formula , and obtained the result that @xmath17 realizes a supercuspidal part of the local jacquet - langlands correspondence .",
    "one of nice points of his approach is that one can directly observe that the character relation , that characterizes the local jacquet - langlands correspondence , actually appears in @xmath17 .",
    "roughly speaking , the work @xcite can be divided into two parts ; the geometric part and the representation - theoretic part . in the first part ( @xcite ) , strauch established the lefschetz trace formula for the lubin - tate tower and counted the number of fixed points under the group action on the tower . in the second part , he deduced from the lefschetz trace formula that the local jacquet - langlands correspondence appears in @xmath17 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give an alternative approach to the latter , that is , the representation - theoretic part of @xcite .",
    "the main difference is as follows . in @xcite ,",
    "strauch considered the @xmath13-isotypic part @xmath19 $ ] of @xmath17 for a fixed supercuspidal representation @xmath13 of @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", we will begin with an irreducible smooth representation @xmath20 of @xmath16 and consider the @xmath20-isotypic part @xmath21 $ ] . although the final consequences are more or less similar , our approach has some advantage .",
    "in fact , we can obtain some results on a non - supercuspidal representation of @xmath14 .",
    "this is because the image @xmath22 of @xmath20 under the local jacquet - langlands correspondence is not necessarily supercuspidal .",
    "here is a part of our main results :    [ thm : intro ] as a virtual representation , @xmath21-(-1)^{d-1}d\\operatorname{\\mathit{jl}}(\\rho)$ ] is a linear combination of parabolically induced representations .",
    "in particular , @xmath21 $ ] is not zero .    for a more precise statement ,",
    "see section [ sec : lt - rep ] .",
    "this theorem implies the following consequence :    if an irreducible discrete series representation @xmath13 appears in @xmath21 $ ] , then @xmath23 .    together with @xcite",
    ", we can also deduce the main result of strauch ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.1.3 ) from theorem [ thm : intro ] :    for an irreducible supercuspidal representation @xmath13 of @xmath14 , the @xmath13-isotypic part @xmath24 $ ] of @xmath25 is isomorphic to @xmath26 , where @xmath20 is the irreducible smooth representation of @xmath16 with @xmath23 .",
    "the main tool in the argument of @xcite is the description of a supercuspidal representation as the compact induction from a compact - mod - center subgroup , which is a part of the classification result in @xcite . on the other hand , in this article",
    "we extensively use local harmonic analysis , such as transfer of orbital integrals .",
    "the author thinks it possible to extend our method to many other rapoport - zink spaces .",
    "for example , in the forthcoming paper @xcite , we will investigate the alternating sum of the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the rapoport - zink tower for @xmath27 , by combining the method in this paper with the lefschetz trace formula developed in @xcite ; in this case , we should replace orbital integrals by stable orbital integrals .",
    "we sketch the outline of this paper .",
    "in section 2 , we briefly recall definitions and notation concerning the lubin - tate tower . in section 3",
    ", we deduce a relation between the distribution character of @xmath21 $ ] and that of @xmath20 from the lefschetz trace formula .",
    "the author prefers this relation , since it is compatible with the modern characterization of local endoscopic lifts . in section 4 , we prove that , over the subset of @xmath14 consisting of elliptic regular elements , the distribution character of @xmath21 $ ] is given by a locally constant function @xmath28 , which is strongly related to the ( usual ) character of @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , in this section we do not need the character theory due to harish - chandra . in section 5 ,",
    "we derive some representation - theoretic conclusions from our character relation . in this step , in addition to the local jacquet - langlands correspondence , we require a rather strong finiteness property on @xmath21 $ ] , which is proved by using the faltings - fargues isomorphism ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    * * acknowledgment**the author would like to thank noriyuki abe and matthias strauch for useful discussions .",
