    "the rotor model ( see below ) has been introduced in @xcite and further studied from the physical point of view in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for replacing the usual elastic reflection in billiard models with such an interaction is that this way the a priori independent motion of point particles can be coupled . despite of the physical interest in the subject",
    ", there is only a very little amount of mathematically rigorous discussion .",
    "this is related to the difficulty of the problem  even the simplest possible _ hyperbolic _ candidates , planar sinai billiards with circular scatterers and the related lorentz gas models turned out to be rather complicated . in @xcite",
    "a detailed analysis has been given for a zero measure set of trajectories that possess special symmetries .",
    "in the present article we investigate the rotor interaction in the context of _ elliptic _ billiards .",

    "the one particle system is well known to be integrable ( @xcite p.  26 ) , while the dynamics of several point particles is the direct product of the individual regular systems .",
    "however , if we replace the inner ( and possibly the outer ) circular billiard scatterer with a rotating object , regularity may be destroyed .",
    "three different models are investigated in this article . in section  [ sec2 ]",

    "velocity evolution is minimal ( theorem  [ thbase ] ) and the two dimensional system of our point particle is ergodic ( theorem  [ thskew ] ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] the motion of _ two _ point particles is discussed in case the inner scatterer is rotating and the outer one is kept to be a billiard . though this problem is significantly more complicated , it is possible to find an open set of parameters and , correspondingly , a positive measure set of initial conditions , that this system behaves as the one discussed in section  [ sec3 ] for an arbitrary long finite time ( theorem  [ two ] and remark  [ twoskew ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    "this result is probably the most interesting as it indicates , as claimed in the physics literature ( see @xcite ) , the following phenomena : the rotor interaction switches on non - trivial coupling among the particles that would follow independent ( in our case integrable ) patterns if they were studied in the original billiard setting .    throughout the paper we consider the motion of point particles in the annular region bounded by two concentric circles , the outer having radius one , the inner radius @xmath0 .",

    "we may assume that both particles alternate . otherwise motion is a direct product of two integrable systems : two circle billiards if both particles remain outside and a product of a circle billiard with the system discussed in section  [ sec2 ] if one of them alternates .",

    "however , at this point the exposition ceases to be parallel to that of section  [ secvel ] .",
    "the two transformations above may follow each other in a more complicated manner and it is not enough to take two copies of the circle to describe the velocity evolution .",
    "consider the poincar section for the cross section of v - collisions .",
    "when the system is in state @xmath71 , there is a unique tangential velocity @xmath218  and thus , as the normal velocity component @xmath2 is an integral of motion , a unique velocity vector @xmath181  for the first particle .",

    "if the number of u - collisions before the next v - collision is even , the scatterer , just before the next v - collision , will rotate with the exact same angular velocity @xmath220 .",
    "this implies that just after the second v - collision the system arrives at the state @xmath221 ( cf . ) . on the other hand , if the number of u - collisions in this time interval is odd , the scatterer rotates with angular velocity @xmath222 just before the second v - collision , and thus the system lands just after the second v - collision at the state @xmath223 ( cf . ) .    to calculate the number of u - collisions within the time interval @xmath224 $ ] we denote by [ t2 ] _",

    "if the two particles started from the inner scatterer at the same time , the parity of u - collisions until the next v - collision would depend only on the relation of these two quantities : it would be even / odd for @xmath227 less than ( greater than ) @xmath228 . to track the velocity evolution in the general case",
    "we need to introduce one more coordinate .    at the moment of a v - collision ( i.e.  on our poincar section )",

    "note that @xmath134 is well defined since @xmath233 and @xmath228 both depend on @xmath71 , see equation  .",
    "the reason for the rescaling term @xmath234 in the evolution of the @xmath231coordinate for the odd case is that , as there has been an odd number of u - collisions , the length of the period for the second particle is @xmath235 in contrast to the previous @xmath236 .",

    "however , as the theorem below shows , for a suitable choice of integrals and , correspondingly , initial conditions ( both of positive measure ) , there is an arbitrary long time interval for which the @xmath231 coordinate can be disregarded and for which the velocity motion follows a rotation orbit .",
