    "the weak galerkin method was recently introduced in @xcite for second order elliptic equations .",
    "it is an extension of the standard galerkin finite element method where classical derivatives were substituted by weakly defined derivatives on functions with discontinuity .",

    "numerical implementations of weak galerkin were discussed in @xcite for some model problems .",
    "the weak galerkin method has already demonstrated many nice properties in various cases  @xcite .",

    "* we consider both the original system and the reduced system .",
    "the original weak galerkin discretization of involves degrees of freedom both on the interior of each mesh element and on mesh edges / faces . the reduced system , which only involves degrees of freedom on edges / faces , is to our knowledge first rigorously constructed and analyzed here .",

    "a classical geometric multigrid method constructs discrete spaces on different mesh levels using the same type of discretization .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as following . in section [ sec : weakgalerkin ] , we give a brief introduction of the weak galerkin method , and in section [ sec : multigrid ] , we construct the auxiliary space multigrid preconditioner for the weak galerkin discretization , and prove that the condition number of the preconditioned system does not depend on the mesh size .",

    "the reduced system involves less degrees of freedom than the original weak galerkin system .",
    "indeed , the difference between these two degrees of freedom is exactly @xmath268 , which is equal to @xmath269 times the total number of mesh triangles in two - dimension , and @xmath270 times the total number of mesh tetrahedron in three - dimension .",
    "more importantly , the schur complement @xmath271 is also a spd matrix and has the same sparsity as @xmath272 . therefore solving the reduced system is more efficient than solving the original system provided a good preconditioner for is available . in the rest of this section",

    "note that the algorithm is implemented in the matrix formulation .",
    "the analysis , however , is given in the operator form . in the following",
    "we will introduce corresponding operators .",
    "we first introduce an @xmath273-orthogonal projector @xmath274 from @xmath257 to @xmath256 as follows : for @xmath255 , define @xmath275 such that @xmath276 it is not hard to see that @xmath277 is a well - defined norm on @xmath257 . in the following analysis we shall always equip @xmath257 with this new norm and @xmath256 with the inherited norm @xmath144 . by the trace inequality , the inverse inequality and the definition of @xmath144 , one has @xmath278 which implies that @xmath279 is a bounded linear operator under the newly assigned norms .",
    "denote by @xmath280 and @xmath281 the space of bounded linear functionals on @xmath256 and @xmath257 , respectively .",
    "then the bounded linear operator @xmath274 induces a bounded dual operator @xmath282 , i.e. , for @xmath283 , @xmath284 for all @xmath285 .",
    "in particular , let @xmath286 be defined by @xmath287 for @xmath35 , then one has @xmath288 .",
    "we claim , and will prove later , that the operator form of the schur complement equation is @xmath289 note that by the property of the projection @xmath274 , equation can also be written into the symmetric form @xmath290 for all @xmath255 .    to prove this , we first define a linear operator @xmath291 by : for a function @xmath292 , one has @xmath293 such that @xmath294 the well - posedness of @xmath295 follows directly from the coercivity of @xmath109 on @xmath57 , and consequently on its subspace @xmath256 .",
    "moreover , the restriction of @xmath295 to @xmath256 is symmetric and positive definite . noticing that @xmath296 is locally defined on each mesh element , it is clear that @xmath295 is also locally defined on each mesh element .",
    "denote by @xmath297 the piecewise divergence operator on @xmath77 , and by @xmath298 the @xmath90 projection . using the above notation and the definition of @xmath299 , the second equation in implies that @xmath300 which leads to @xmath301    next",
    ", we note that the projection @xmath274 is identical to @xmath302 on @xmath257 :    [ lem : orthogonal ] the orthogonal operator @xmath303 @xmath304    by the definition of weak gradient @xmath299 and @xmath295 , we have @xmath305 by the definition of @xmath274 , we then complete the proof of the lemma .",
    "the operator @xmath274 corresponds to the matrix @xmath306 .",
    "now , by and lemma [ lem : orthogonal ] , one has @xmath307 .",
    "substituting this into the first equation of gives @xmath308    this completes the derivation of the reduced problem from the original problem .",
    "here we emphasize again that @xmath309 is bounded in the sense that latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : boundedlf }     we will further reformulate the reduced system . to this end , we define a subspace of @xmath57 as @xmath311 , which is just the graph of @xmath257 under @xmath312 .",
    "the space @xmath313 inherits the norm @xmath144 from @xmath57 , and hence @xmath313 and @xmath257 ( equipped with the norm @xmath314 ) are clearly isomorphic under the mapping @xmath315 .",
    "moreover , the right - hand side of equation can be written into @xmath316 where @xmath317 is a bounded linear functional on @xmath313 according to .    by using lemma [ lem : orthogonal ] and combining the above analysis",
    ", equation can now be rewritten into : find @xmath318 such that @xmath319 the well - posedness of then follows from the continuity and coercivity of the bilinear form @xmath320 restricted to @xmath313 and the fact that @xmath317 is a bounded linear functional on @xmath313 .",
    "now we are able to consider an auxiliary space multigrid preconditioner for the reduced system , using again the @xmath0 conforming piecewise linear finite element space as the auxiliary space .",
    "denote by @xmath321 the restriction of operator @xmath149 , defined in , to the subspace @xmath313 .",

    "this completes the proof of the lemma .    to verify the approximation property ,",
    "we first explore the relation between @xmath331 and @xmath332 for @xmath333 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath334 for all @xmath333 when the diffusion coefficient matrix @xmath212 is piecewise constant .",
    "when @xmath212 is piecewise constant , we have for all @xmath333 , @xmath335    recall that @xmath336 . since @xmath274 is the orthogonal projection",
    ", we have @xmath337 on the other hand , using the relation and the fact that both @xmath338 and @xmath212 are piecewise constant , @xmath339 therefore @xmath340 the fact @xmath341 and the orthogonality   implies @xmath342 .",
    "similar to the analysis in section [ sec : multigrid ] , we can establish the following results .",
    "[ lem : reducedspectralradius ] suppose @xmath4 is piecewise constant and the space @xmath313 is non - trivial , i.e. , the triangulation contains at least one interior vertex .",
    "then the spectral radius of operator @xmath321 , denoted by @xmath343 , is of order @xmath155 .",
    "recall that @xmath344 since @xmath345 , we immediately get @xmath346 .    to show the lower bound , we pick a hat function @xmath333 . by the standard scaling argument , @xmath347 we then chose @xmath348 and estimate its norms .",
    "first @xmath349 second , as @xmath338 is piecewise constant , @xmath350 and @xmath351 combining , , and , we obtain @xmath352 which implies @xmath353 .",
    "now we are able to derive the following approximation property :    under the same assumptions as in lemma [ lem : reducedspectralradius ] , one has @xmath354    by the triangular inequality and equation",

    "this completes the proof of the lemma .    finally , for variable efficient @xmath212 , if we denoted by @xmath361 , the piecewise constant approximation of @xmath212 , then it is easy to show @xmath362 therefore , a good preconditioner for the piecewise constant case will lead to a good preconditioner for the variable case .",
    "we are able to claim that , the auxiliary space multigrid preconditioner for the reduced system again yields a preconditioner system with condition number of @xmath363 .",
    "suppose we have a smoother @xmath187 and auxiliary solver @xmath245 satisfying the property : for all @xmath364 , @xmath193 , @xmath365 let @xmath247 or defined implicitly by the relation @xmath366 .",
