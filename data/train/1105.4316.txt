    "magnetic field effects ( mfes ) on various processes in organic semiconductors are actively studied for many years.@xcite these studies concern different types of mfes : the magnetic field dependent photoconductivity,@xcite and photoluminescence,@xcite , magnetoelectroluminescence,@xcite magnetoresistance,@xcite etc .",
    "the mechanisms of mfes in these processes are the subjects of hot debates for many years .",
    "it is , however , widely accepted,@xcite that a large number of mfes result from the effect of the magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) on the spin selective reactions with participation of paramagnetic particles : polarons ( @xmath4 ) and triplet excitons ( @xmath5 ) . in a large number of them",
    "the key stage is the recombination of pairs of electron ( @xmath6 ) and hole ( @xmath7 ) polarons , i.e. particles with electronic spin @xmath8,@xcite which are called hereafter polaron pairs ( pp ) .",
    "the @xmath9 quenching @xmath10 annihilation are also believed be the important spin selective process which can give significant contribution to the observed mfes in organic semiconductors.@xcite    there are some reviews of experimental and theoretical works on mfes in organic semiconductors.@xcite recent extensive experimental investigations , however , inspire further theoretical studies of mfes.@xcite despite evident progress in these studies there are still many problems to be discussed .",
    "in particular , close attention has been attracted to the @xmath11 pp recombination mechanism of mfes in disordered semiconductors.@xcite the important problem consists in proper treatment of the effect of polaron migration and disorder of spin dependent interactions , giving rise to the mfes .",
    "the majority of theoretical works are mainly based either on numerical or somewhat simplified analytical description of the spin / space evolution of pps,@xcite though fairly high accuracy of above mentioned recent measurements motivates more detailed theoretical investigations , which could allow for obtaining sufficiently accurate and rigorous formulas for the mfes .    in this work",
    "we discuss the method of describing specific features of the pp recombination mechanism of mfes in disordered organic semiconductors .",
    "the method is based on the diffusion approximation for hopping polaron migration , fairly reasonable at long times of mfe formation .",
    "the hopping motion is assumed to lead not only to stochastic spatial evolution but also to fluctuations of disordered spin dependent hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) and anisotropic part of the zeeman interaction ( azi ) , resulting from the anisotropy of @xmath12-factors of polarons .",
    "the fluctuating hfi and azi give rise to spin relaxation , which is described by bloch - type equations , valid in the realistic limit of hopping rates much larger than these interactions ( in frequency units ) .",
    "the kinetics of mfe generation is determined by the spin / space evolution of pps , which is described by the pp spin density matrix . in the above - formulated approximations",
    "this matrix satisfies the stochastic liouville equation ( sle).@xcite    with the sle approach we analyze the properties of mfe for geminate and bulk processes within two models of pp relative motion : free diffusion and diffusion in the presence of a potential well.@xcite the pp spin evolution is described taking into consideration the above - mentioned hfi and azi induced relaxation , as well @xmath0-mechanism.@xcite in these two models of relative motion simple expressions are derived for the mfe , i.e. for @xmath1 dependent recombination yield @xmath2 and rate @xmath3 ( in geminate and bulk precesses , respectively ) .",
    "the analysis with obtained formulas reveals different types of @xmath2 and @xmath3 behavior , as @xmath1 increased , for hfi and azi induced relaxation mechanisms : decreasing and decreasing , respectively .",
    "the combination of these mechanisms is found to result in a large variety of non - monotonic @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependences .",
    "the extra contribution of @xmath0-mechanism can lead to some additional specific features of mfes behavior at large magnetic fields @xmath1 whose specific features appear to depend on the mechanism of relative motion of polarons .",
    "in our discussion we also concern some possible applications of obtained expressions to the interpretation of some recent experimental results .",
    "the characteristic properties of mfes on the migration assisted pp recombination are , naturally , essentially determined by the mechanism of polaron migration .",
    "there are a number of models of migration in disorder semiconductors .",
    "one of the most popular is the miller - abrahams model.@xcite in this model the rate @xmath13 of hopping from the site @xmath14 to the site @xmath15 is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the characteristic rate constant , @xmath18 is the heaviside step function , @xmath19 is the distance between these sites , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energies of initial and final states , respectively , assumed to be randomly distributed parameters whose ( broad ) distribution functions are determined by a number of intra and interpolaron interaction.@xcite    even in this relatively simple model the kinetics of the space / time evolution of charge carriers can be obtained only numerically .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the mfes are determined by very long times of order of the characteristic time @xmath22 of spin evolution of @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarons,@xcite which is much longer than the average hopping time @xmath23 : @xmath24 ( see sec .",
    "viii ) . at times",
    "@xmath25 in the wide region of parameters of the model the space / time evolution is fairly reasonably described by the diffusion approximation .",
    "one of indications of this fact is a reasonably good accuracy of the langevin formula for the recombination rate.@xcite    in the diffusion approximation the migration kinetics of @xmath26-polaron ( @xmath27 ) is described by the time dependent probability distribution function @xmath28 in the continuum space @xmath29 , obeying the smoluchowski equation @xmath30 in eq.([mot1a ] ) @xmath31 is the effective diffusion coefficient for @xmath26-polaron , in which @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the characteristic hopping length and hopping rate .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ mot1a ] ) is actually a selfconsistent equation , which incorporates many particle effects , showing themselves in possible dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the concentration of polarons , as well as concentration and temperature dependence of the effective potential @xmath34.@xcite    our further analysis of mfes will be based on the diffusion approximation ( [ mot1a ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , some specific features of hopping kinetics at short times , predicted by the miller - abrahams model , appear to be important as well for the description of mfes ( see below ) .",
    "quantum ( spin ) pp evolution plays the key role in the generation of mfes on pp recombination .",
    "pp recombination is known to be a spin selective process with the rate depending on the total electron spin of the pair of @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarons : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spin of @xmath26-polaron ( @xmath37 ) . in our discussion",
    "we will assume that the rate is non - zero only in the singlet ( @xmath38 ) state corresponding to the total pp spin @xmath39.@xcite    the spin evolution of @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarons is described by spin density matrices @xmath40 in the two state hilbert spaces , in which two states @xmath41 correspond to two spin projections onto @xmath42-axis , taken to be parallel to the vector @xmath43 of external magnetic field : @xmath44 .",
    "in general , these matrices can be represented in terms of expansion in bilinear combinations of the states @xmath45 can be considered as vectors in some space , called hereafter the liouville space and denoted as @xmath46 , in which the conjugated vectors @xmath47 are defined by the relation @xmath48 .",
    "noteworthy is also that this definition implies linear independence of the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 . in @xmath46-space , the density matrices",
    "@xmath52 can be written as a vectors : @xmath53 in addition to vectors , in the liouville space one can also introduce operators , which will be called superoperators .    the time evolution of the spin density matrix @xmath54 satisfies the schrdinger equation ( hereafter we put @xmath55 , i.e. use frequency units for energy parameters ) @xmath56 in this equation @xmath57 the spin hamiltonian superoperator ( operator in the liouville space ) expressed in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath58 ( in the hilbert space ) by the relation @xmath59 for matrix elements of @xmath57 we get @xmath60 .",
    "in general the spin hamiltonian @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 ) , depends on the coordinate @xmath63 of @xmath26-polaron , due to inhomogeneity of the medium .",
    "this dependence results in fluctuations of @xmath64 caused by hopping motion of @xmath26-polaron , i.e. stochastic changing @xmath65 . the hamiltonian can conventionally be represented as a sum of the stationary and fluctuating parts : @xmath66 in which the stationary part @xmath67 is the average zeeman interaction of the electron spin @xmath68 with the magnetic field @xmath43 .",
    "the fluctuating parts @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent hfi and azi contributions , respectively .",
    "fluctuating hfi and azi induce spin relaxation , which can be treated within the short correlation time approximation.@xcite in this approximation the relaxation is described by the bloch - redfield equations for spin density matrices of polarons.@xcite the relaxation kinetics is determined by the relaxation supermatrices of the form @xmath71 for both hfi ( @xmath72 ) and azi ( @xmath73 ) mechanisms , where @xmath74 ) and non - diagonal ( @xmath75 ) elements of the density matrix .",

    "the form of functions @xmath83 depends on the mechanism of fluctuations . in the considered model of polaron - hopping induced fluctuations these functions are essentially determined by hopping kinetics and specific features of the orientational distribution of molecules responsible for the hfi and azi . in our work",

    "<S> characteristic properties of magnetic field effects on spin selective geminate and bulk electron - hole polaron pair ( pp ) recombination are analyzed in detail within the approach based on the stochastic liouville equation . </S>",
    "<S> simple expressions for the magnetic field ( b ) dependence of recombination yield and rate are derived within two models of relative pp motion : free diffusion and diffusion in the presence of well ( cage ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin evolution of pps is described taking in account the relaxation induced by hyperfine interaction , anisotropic part of the zeeman interaction induced , as well as @xmath0-mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> a large variety of the @xmath1-dependences of the recombination yield @xmath2 and rate @xmath3 is obtained depending on the relative weights of above - mentioned mechanisms . the proposed general method and derived particular formulas are shown to be quite useful for the analysis of recent experimental results . </S>"
