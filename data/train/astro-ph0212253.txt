    "accurate measurements of the spectra of primary cosmic rays have deep astrophysical implications , since they provide important information on the mechanisms of production of cosmic rays and of the matter distribution in the interstellar space .",
    "in fact , the spectral shapes of proton and helium nuclei fluxes are sensitive indicators of the processes of particle acceleration , and the observed fluxes are the primary measure of the energy density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium",
    ". their spectra also serve as important inputs to calculations that aim to predict the secondary antiproton or positron spectra , which result from high  energy interactions of protons and helium nuclei with the interstellar gas .",
    "recently , the importance of the normalization of the primary cosmic  ray flux has been emphasized in connection to the atmospheric neutrino observations performed by underground experiments , e.g. super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite . a correct interpretation of these measurements",
    "depends on the accuracy of the predictions to which they are compared .",
    "the assumptions about the flux of cosmic rays that impinge on the earth turn out to be among the main sources of inaccuracies in the simulation of atmospheric showers @xcite . for energies above 10  gev , where the effect of the solar modulation is less than about 10% , there is still a difference of about 10%20% in the absolute fluxes published in the recent years @xcite .    from this experimental scenario ,",
    "the need arises for measurements extended over a large energy range and with a good understanding of the systematic uncertainties associated with them .",
    "measurements of primary particles have been carried out using different techniques : magnet spectrometers , e.g. @xcite , and rich detectors @xcite have been used for energies up to 100200 gev / n , while calorimetric measurements extend to higher energies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , comparisons among such measurements show sometimes significant discrepancies .",
    "the differences are probably due to imprecise or incomplete knowledge of detectors response functions during the flight .",
    "monte  carlo simulations or calibrations at low energy in the laboratory prior to flight are not ideal since experimental conditions in the gondola such as temperature or pressure may not be stable during the flight .",
    "if the response function is based on the performance of individual detectors in the laboratory , systematic uncertainties are likely when operated with other detectors and would introduce a bias .",
    "so , the best experimental determination of the efficiencies and calibrations is to make use of redundant detectors to select a set of `` good '' events independent of the other detectors .",
    "these sets of events can be used to determine the response function of the detectors which are not involved in the selection .    in this paper",
    "we report a new measurement of the primary proton and helium nuclei spectra with the caprice98 instrument , which combines different detector techniques .",
    "this instrument , described in section [ c98 ] , consisted of a superconducting magnet spectrometer , a ring  imaging cherenkov detector and an imaging calorimeter . with these independent detectors , it was possible to accurately determine both the efficiency and the systematic error associated with each detector .",
    "the data analysis is described in section [ datana ] , which includes the determination of detector efficiencies , systematic errors and the corrections applied .",
    "the final results and discussions are presented in section [ finres ] .",
    "the results cover a range of kinetic energy from 3 to 350  gev for protons , and from 0.9 to 150  gev  nucleon@xmath5 for helium nuclei .",

    "the data analyzed for this work were collected at an average atmospheric depth of about 5.5 g / cm@xmath4 ( atmospheric pressure of 4.0  to  5.1  mbar , altitude of 36.038.2  km ) , during an exposure time of almost 21 hours .",
    "the experimental setup was a renewed configuration of the caprice94 apparatus @xcite which was successfully used in a previous balloon experiment at low geomagnetic cut  off in 1994 .",
    "the caprice98 apparatus @xcite is shown in fig . [ caprice ] : it consisted of , from the top to the bottom , a gas ring imaging cherenkov detector ( gas rich ) , a time  of  flight device ( tof ) , a superconducting magnet spectrometer ( tracking system ) , and a silicon  tungsten imaging calorimeter .",
    "the rich detector @xcite used a 1 m tall gas ( c@xmath10f@xmath11 , @xmath12 ) radiator and a photosensitive multi  wire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) mounted above it .",
    "the cherenkov photons were reflected into the chamber by a spherical mirror located at the bottom of the radiator .",
    "the chamber was filled with tmae  saturated ethane gas .",
    "the signals were acquired by means of a pad readout implemented on one cathode plane .",
    "this plane had an area of 51.2@xmath151.2  cm@xmath6 , divided in 64@xmath164 pads of size 8@xmath18  mm@xmath6 , where the cone of cherenkov light gave a ring  like image .",
    "the ring diameter , dependent on the velocity of the particle , increased from 0 at the rich threshold ( about 18  gv for protons ) to about 11  cm ( @xmath1450  mrad cherenkov angle ) for a @xmath151 particle .",
    "about half of the particles triggered by the instrument passed through the mwpc , where they ionized the gas .",
    "the ionization signals were amplified and detected by the pad plane along with the cherenkov signals .",
    "a single photoelectron detected by the multi  wire proportional chamber was collected by 35 pads . for @xmath151 singly charged particles ,",
    "an average of 12 photoelectrons per event were detected .",
    "this rich detector was designed primarily to identify antiprotons in the cosmic rays against a large background of electrons , muons and pions @xcite .",
    "the time  of  flight ( tof ) system consisted of two planes of plastic scintillators , located immediately above and below the tracking stack .",
    "each plane was segmented into two paddles viewed at opposite ends by 5  cm diameter photomultiplier tubes .",
    "each paddle had a size of 25@xmath150  cm@xmath6 and a thickness of 1 cm .",
    "the signals from each photomultiplier were independently digitized for time  of  flight measurements as well as for pulse height analysis .",
    "the scintillator signals also provided the trigger for the data acquisition system .",
    "the distance between the two scintillator layers was 1.2  m and the system had a time resolution of about 230 ps .",
    "the magnet spectrometer consisted of a single coil superconducting magnet @xcite , which had been used in all the previous flights operated by the wizard collaboration , and a tracking device consisting of three modules of drift chambers @xcite",
    ". the total height of the spectrometer was about 110 cm .",
    "the lateral sides of each chamber box were made from 1  cm thick epoxy  composite plates , while the open top and bottom sides were covered with 160  @xmath16 m thick copper plated mylar windows .",
    "the inner gas volume of each box was of size 47@xmath147@xmath135  @xmath17 .",
    "the drift chamber had six layers , each containing sixteen 27.02  mm wide drift cells , for measurements in the x  directions and four layers for the y  direction .",
    "this system performed 18 measurements along the direction of maximum bending ( @xmath18 ) and 12 measurements along the perpendicular view ( @xmath19 ) , with a resolution better than 100  @xmath16 m .",
    "the alignment of each drift chamber with the whole tracking system is important for a precise rigidity determination from the measured deflection .",
    "this was done by comparing the extrapolation of the track fitted by one chamber to the track fitted by all the drift chambers .",
    "any statistically significant differences in the fitted tracks would then be due to misalignment between the drift chambers .",
    "thus , the position of each wire in one drift chamber was determined precisely by comparing the data from the fitted tracks using all the drift chambers with the position provided by the data for that drift chamber .",
    "this was done for all three drift chambers iteratively .",
    "this procedure of calibration of the drift chamber positions was repeated every 30 minutes of the measured data to correct for possible temperature deviation @xcite .",
    "the magnet was operated at a current of 120 a , giving rise to a field of intensity 0.12 t in the region of the tracking device .",
    "the outer diameter of the coil was 61  cm and the inner diameter 36  cm .",
    "the coil was placed in a dewar filled with liquid helium surrounded by a vacuum shell enclosed in a second dewar .",
    "this dewar was filled with liquid nitrogen that reduced the rate of evaporation of liquid helium and enabled to attain a life time of about 100 hours for the superconducting magnet .",
    "the exact position of the magnet coil , relative to the drift chamber volumes was first estimated from the drawings and then determined precisely with the tracking information from ground and flight data .",
    "the position of the magnet coil was fixed by an iterative procedure , fitting the drift chamber data using different position for the magnet .",
    "the minimization of a @xmath20@xmath6  gave the magnet position .",
    "the magnet position was determined with an uncertainty of less than 0.1  cm @xcite .",
    "using the position information together with the map of the magnetic field , the rigidity of the particle was determined .        from the distribution of the deflection uncertainty , obtained on an event",
    " by  event basis during the fitting procedure ( see @xcite ) , which is shown in figure [ sigmadef ] , an average maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) of 300  gv was obtained .",
    "the caprice98 calorimeter configuration was the same as that in the previous caprice experiments .",
    "it was designed @xcite to distinguish non  interacting minimum ionizing particles , hadronic and electromagnetic showers .",
    "the calorimeter consisted of eight 48@xmath148  cm@xmath6 silicon planes interleaved with seven tungsten converters , each one radiation length ( x@xmath21 ) thick . a single plane consisted of an array of 8@xmath18 silicon detectors .",
    "each detector had a total area of 60@xmath160  mm@xmath6 and was divided into 16 strips , each of width 3.6  mm . for every silicon plane",
    "the detectors were mounted on the two sides of a g10  motherboard with perpendicular strips to give @xmath18 and @xmath19 readout .",
    "the strips of each detectors were daisy  chained longitudinally to form a 48  cm long single strip .",
    "this design provided a high longitudinal and transversal granularity for shower imaging .",
    "the total depth of the calorimeter was 7.2 radiation lengths and 0.33 interaction length for protons .",
    "the analysis was based on 21  hours of data for a total acquisition time of 67240  seconds under an average residual atmosphere of 5.5  g / cm@xmath6  .",
    "the fractional live time during the flight was 0.4865@xmath00.0002 resulting in a total live time ( @xmath22)of 32712@xmath013  s.    protons are the most common singly charged positive particles in the cosmic radiation . in measurements made with balloon  borne instruments",
    "there is also a small contribution of secondary particles produced in the residual atmosphere above the detector , as well as in the instrument itself . in the case of",
    "singly charged positive particles , these are mainly protons , muons , pions , and positrons .",
    "there is also a small component of primary positrons .",
    "apart from protons , helium nuclei are the most abundant particles in the cosmic ",
    "rays ; they are mainly present in the form of the @xmath2he isotope .",
    "the combination of detectors of the caprice98 apparatus provided the redundant measurements needed for cross  checks of the in  flight detector performances .",
    "it allowed clean samples of particles to be selected by subsets of these detectors , making it possible to accurately determine the rigidity ",
    "dependent efficiency and rejection power of each individual detector and to estimate their systematic errors .",
    "all selected singly charged particles , i.e. hydrogen nuclei , which include deuterons , were treated as being protons in this analysis . moreover , no attempt was made in this analysis to separate @xmath23he from @xmath2he nuclei , and hence , all z  @xmath24  2 particles were treated as being @xmath2he .",
    "it can be pointed out that usually the isotope discrimination can be made only over a limited energy region depending on the experimental setup and further , in most of the publications ( i.e. @xcite ) relating to elemental spectra , the above procedure had been adopted .",
    "therefore , we followed the same procedure for the caprice98 experiment and this provides a meaningful comparison with other published data .",
    "isotope abundances are being analyzed separately ( i.e. @xcite ) and will be published at a later date .",
    "because of the over abundance of protons and helium nuclei among primary cosmic rays the contamination of other particles in the samples was not a major issue .",
    "hence , the selection was optimized to have an efficiency as high as possible .",
    "figure [ eventi ] shows a schematic view of two protons ( top ) and two helium nuclei ( bottom ) in the caprice98 apparatus .",
    "each of the four sub ",
    "figures shows two panels , corresponding respectively to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 view .",
    "the rich detector is shown at the top . a rotated view of the signals in the pad plane of the multi  wire proportional chamber is shown in the square frame in the center of the figure .",
    "the three central boxes are the drift chambers of the tracking system .",
    "the box at the bottom shows the calorimeter information and the line drawn through all detectors represents the fitted track of the particle ( note that the calorimeter is not drawn to scale ) . in the left",
    "are shown the non  interacting particles and to the right are a proton and a helium nucleus interacting in the calorimeter producing hadronic showers .",
    "the tracking information was used to determine the rigidity of the particles . in order to eliminate events with more than one track in the spectrometer and to achieve a reliable estimation of the rigidity , a set of conditions",
    "was imposed on the fitted tracks :    * at least 11 ( out of 18 ) position measurements in the @xmath18 direction and 7 ( out of 12 ) in the @xmath19 direction were required ; * an acceptable @xmath20@xmath6  for the fitted track in both directions was required as well ; * the estimated error on the deflection had to be less than 0.02  gv@xmath5 .    the choice of these cuts was partly based on the experience gained previously using the same tracking system @xcite and it allowed a reliable estimation of the rigidity together with a high tracking efficiency , section [ trackeff ] .",
    "the same set of conditions was used both for protons and helium nuclei .",
    "the tof information was used for selecting downward moving particles .",
    "the resolution of 230  ps , which was small compared to the flight time of more than 4  ns , assured that no contamination from albedo particles remained in the selected sample .",
    "protons : : :    the pulse height information , shown in figure [ mip ] , from the top    scintillator was used to select singly charged particles as well as to    reject multi ",
    "particle events coming from interactions above the top    scintillator .",
    "this was done by requiring the following two conditions :    +       +    * de / dx losses in the top scintillator to be less than 1.8  mip ( where    a mip is the most probable energy loss for a minimum ionizing    particle ) .",
    "this condition was chosen in order to reject about 90% of    the multi  particle events .",
    "* only one paddle must be hit in the top scintillator plane .",
    "+    protons interacting in the calorimeter could produce backscattered    particles that traverse the bottom scintillator paddles giving an    additional signal .",
    "none of these cases significantly affected the    performance of the tracking system .",
    "therefore , no restrictions were    put on on the pulse height from the bottom scintillator .",
    "multiple    tracks were also rejected by requiring that no more than one of the    two paddles in the bottom scintillator plane was hit .",
    "helium nuclei : : :    to select particle with charge two , both the top and bottom    scintillators were used :    +    * de / dx losses in the top scintillator should be greater than 3 , but    less than 7  mip ;    * only one paddle must be hit in the top scintillator plane ;    * de / dx losses in the bottom scintillator should be greater than    3  mip .",
    "+    this selection criteria on the bottom scintillator was chosen in order    to eliminate singly charged particles that remained in the selection    after the de / dx cut in the top scintillator .",

    ", protons were below the cherenkov threshold and they were separated from lighter positive particles by requiring no signal due to cherenkov light in the rich .",
    "however , due to the finite resolution of the tracking system and the change of pressure in the rich during the flight , the selection requirement of no cherenkov light was used only below 14  gv , in order to maximize the efficiency .",
    "the calorimeter provided topological information to select non  interacting particles or to discriminate between hadronic and electromagnetic showers .",
    "the measurement of the energy loss of a particle obtained with the silicon strips of the calorimeter allowed also to measure the absolute value of the charge of non  interacting particles .",
    "however , because of the low efficiency of this selection , the calorimeter was used only to select proton and helium samples for efficiency studies of the other detectors .",
    "the sophisticated particle  identifying detectors used in this experiment made it possible to select clean and independent samples of different particle types to determine the efficiency of each detector .",
    "the resulting efficiencies are shown as a function of rigidity in figure [ ef ] and are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the efficiency of each detector was determined as a function of rigidity in a number of discrete bins .",
    "the efficiency was then parametrized to allow an interpolation between bins .",
    "this parametrization could introduce a systematic error on the efficiency of each detector .",
    "since the parameters were correlated , the error on the efficiency was obtained using the error matrix of the fit for each detector when correcting the measured flux for the detector efficiencies .",
    "then , assuming that the resulting systematic errors associated with different detector efficiencies were uncorrelated , they were quadratically summed .",
    "the tracking efficiency was obtained from test samples of protons and helium nuclei selected by combining the information from the other detectors .    protons",
    ": : :    two different and independent methods were used to determine the    tracking efficiency and both of them were independent of the drift    chamber tracking system .",
    "they were first tested with muons from ground    data since it was expected , from previous experience @xcite , that    muons and protons had the same tracking efficiency above a few gev .",
    "then the final efficiency was obtained with float data only .",
    "+    * the first method , called `` rich method '' , used the rich detector to    get the rigidity from the cherenkov angle measurement with the help of    an extrapolated straight track from the calorimeter @xcite .",
    "+    at ground the rigidity was derived from the reconstructed cherenkov    angle measured by the rich detector assuming the mass of a muon .",
    "the    composition of cosmic rays at ground is dominated by muons , but there    is also a non  negligible fraction of electrons below 1  gev @xcite and    of protons below about 15  gev @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter    selection was able to reduce the electron contamination to a    negligible amount and protons were not a source of contamination since    they did not produce cherenkov light below 18  gv .    +    at float , protons are the most abundant component , but there are also    singly charged particles , such as muons , electrons and positrons .",
    "this    led to an ambiguity in the definition of the tracking efficiency    sample . since the rigidity determination was based on the velocity    calculated from the cherenkov angle by assuming the mass of the    proton , this method gave the same rigidity for particles with a    different mass having the same measured velocity .",
    "electrons and    positrons were easily rejected by the calorimeter , but non  interacting    protons were undistinguishable from muons . hence the efficiency sample",
    "could contain muons and a small amount of pions , with rigidity greater    than 2  gv along with protons of rigidity greater than 18  gv . as a    result ,",
    "if high energy muons and protons have different tracking    efficiency , this could bias the result .    *",
    "the second method is called `` no  dc method '' @xcite , because it    does not use the drift chambers for track reconstruction , but uses the    same tracking routines for the complete caprice98 tracking system .    instead of the wire planes of the drift chambers",
    ", it uses the particle    positions as determined by ( a ) the pad plane of the mwpc of the rich    detector , ( b ) the two planes of the scintillation detectors of the tof    system , which make use of the time difference between the signals    recorded by the photomultipliers on either end of the scintillators    ( only in the @xmath18 direction ) , and ( c ) at least five layers    in each view from the calorimeter ( with a maximum of 8 layers per    direction ) .",

    "this selection    could be contaminated by muons between 1.5 and 2  gv and by pions    between 1.5 and 3  gv .    +    the two methods at ground gave the same results between 0.2 and 10  gv .",
    "+    with flight data , the first method sampled the tracking efficiency of    protons above 18  gv ( because of the gas  rich threshold ) while the    second below 10  gv . from previous experience with a similar tracking    system @xcite",
    "the proton tracking efficiency was expected to reach a    plateau above 2  gv but in this case the two methods differed by    @xmath142.5% .",
    "however , the second method could be biased by    the contamination of secondary low energy protons that would not    affect the first method @xcite . since the geomagnetic cut ",
    "off was at    about 4.3  gv , the bulk of the singly charged particles was above    4.5  gv , primary protons , and below 1  gv , mostly secondary protons and    muons .",
    "the region between 2 and 4  gv was , in proportion , highly    depopulated . since the mdr of the no  dc method was only 5  gv , even a    small fraction of the low energy protons which spilled over to the    rigidity bin above 2  gv could bias the sample , giving a smaller    efficiency .",
    "this would affect only the proton efficiency of the second    method because the no  light condition in the rich only implied that    protons had rigidities lower than 18  gv . the same does not apply at    ground to the second method since the matching condition between the    expected and the measured cherenkov signal in the rich detector was    required . in the case of protons , the contamination of the no ",
    "dc    sample was examined using a sample with the rigidity measured by the    drift chamber tracking system .",
    "this showed that a contamination of    about 10% was present in the sample below 2  gv @xcite .",
    "another clue    to a contamination in the no  dc sample of protons is given by the    helium nuclei analysis : in that case , the results from the two methods    were in a very good agreement ( about 1% difference ) because there was    no contamination in both the samples , as the de / dx selection rejected    all singly charged particles .",
    "+    thus , the first method was used to obtain the efficiency of the    tracking selection in all the rigidity range , from 4 to 350  gv , and it    was constant at 93.5@xmath00.5% .",
    "this is shown by the    dotted  dashed line in the upper part of figure [ ef ] . however , the    difference found between the proton tracking efficiency with the two    methods was considered as a possible systematic uncertainty and 2.5%    systematic uncertainty was included in the flux calculation for    rigidities between 4 and 20  gv .",
    "helium nuclei : : :    the same two methods were used also in the case of helium nuclei in    the rigidity range 40  gv to 200  gv ( first method ) and from 0.5 to    15  gv ( second method ) . in this case the two methods agreed and the    tracking efficiency for helium nuclei was found to be constant at    80@xmath01% ; the dotted  dashed line in the bottom of figure    [ ef ] shows this result .",
    "the difference between helium nuclei and    protons is due to the higher ionization of the doubly charged    particles causing cross ",

    "as can be noticed in figure [ ef ] , the de / dx efficiency is higher for helium nuclei than for protons .",
    "this is due to different selections applied to helium nuclei and protons .",
    "interactions in the payload produce singly charged multi  particles events that were rejected for protons by requiring the energy loss in the top scintillator to be less than 1.8 mip , a condition stricter with respect to the helium nuclei .",
    "the dependence on the rigidity is due to the relativistic rise of the energy loss function .",
    "the efficiency of the rich was determined only for protons , since the rich is not used in the selection of helium nuclei .",
    "the proton sample was selected by the tof , the de / dx in the scintillators , and the calorimeter ; the calorimeter was used to select interacting protons , in order to reject muons from the sample .",
    "the resulting efficiency is shown in figure [ ef ] by the solid curve .",
    "figure [ richef ] shows the rich efficiency decomposed in its three components :    * the efficiency obtained by requiring agreement between the particle impact position measured by the tracking system and the rich ( solid curve ) ; * the efficiency for no signal due to cherenkov light ( dashed curve ) ; * the efficiency for requiring no ionization signal found outside the ionization cluster ( dotted line ) .",

    "because of this reason , the total efficiency for the rich shown in figure [ ef ] is higher than the product of the three efficiencies shown in figure [ richef ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the `` impact position '' efficiency decreases when protons start to emit cherenkov light .",
    "in fact , if the ionization cluster falls on the border of the pad plane , part of the ionization energy is lost and the cherenkov light distributed over a cluster of paddles can be erroneously confused with the ionization energy . in this case",
    "the matching conditions between the ionization cluster and the impact position determined by the tracking system will not be satisfied .",
    "the `` no  ionization '' condition does not depend on rigidity and the emission of cherenkov light does not affect this selection since only the ionization by a charge particle could give a saturated signal .    the efficiency for `` no light '' condition decreases when protons start to emit cherenkov light .",
    "below the cherenkov threshold , the efficiency is still lower than one because of two different effects .",
    "the first one is due to the finite resolution of the spectrometer , by which some protons with a rigidity greater than the threshold for cherenkov emission contaminate the sample below this threshold .",
    "the second effect is due to the erroneous reconstruction of the cherenkov angle , made by using pads lying just outside the ionization cluster or noisy pads .",
    "the spectrometer accepted particles with a zenith angle less than 14 degrees .",
    "the average angle was 8 degrees .",
    "the geometrical factor was obtained with monte  carlo techniques @xcite ; the simulation implemented the same track ",
    "fitting algorithm used in the analysis to trace particles through the spectrometer .",
    "the geometrical factor ( @xmath26 ) was found to be constant 155.0@xmath01.1  cm@xmath6  sr in the rigidity range 4350  gv both for protons and helium nuclei since the acceptance conditions were the same in the two cases .",
    "the number of detected particles was corrected in order to compensate for the fraction of events lost due to interactions in the payload .    to reach the tracking system of the spectrometer , the particles had to first go through the aluminium shell of the payload and the rich detector , and then through the top scintillator of the tof system .",
    "it was assumed that all particles that interacted above the tracking system were rejected by the selection criteria .",
    "the probability of an interaction in the material of the drift chamber , that would not be rejected by the tracking system conditions , was negligible .",
    "the data were corrected for these losses with multiplicative factors , using the expression for the interaction mean free path for the different materials in the detectors given by stephens @xcite .",
    "the correction is about 10% ( see tables [ tabcorr ] and [ tabcorrhe ] ) .",
    "further corrections were made in order to propagate the flux values estimated at the top of the payload back to the top of the atmosphere .",
    "particles produced in the atmosphere above the detector must be subtracted , the fraction of events lost because of interactions must be compensated and the energy lost by ionization during propagation has to be taken into account . in the case of protons we used the calculation made by papini , grimani , and stephens @xcite and in the case of helium we used the calculation made by vannuccini @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric correction was about 10% .",
    "tables [ tabcorr ] and [ tabcorrhe ] report the number of events observed at the spectrometer and how it changes by applying the payload and atmospheric corrections .",
    "the first column represents the rigidity bins at the spectrometer ; it corresponds to different intervals at the top of the atmosphere due to ionization losses .",
    "the second column contains the selected number of events . by dividing this number by the total efficiency and by accounting the payload correction ( not shown in tables ) it",
    "is possible to obtain the third column ( in the case of the first row of table [ tabcorr ] , i.e. , @xmath27 ) . in the fourth column",
    "is listed the number of lost events due to interactions in the residual atmosphere . by summing these numbers to the third column and by subtracting the number of secondary protons produced in the atmosphere ( not shown in tables ) it is possible to obtain the extrapolated number of events at the top of the atmosphere , fifth column ( always in the case of the first row of table [ tabcorr ] , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the transmission of the particles through the earth s magnetic field had to be taken into account in order to get the fluxes at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the average value of the vertical cut  off rigidity was about 4.3  gv . however , this cut ",
    "off is not a sharp one below which all particles are deflected back to space and above which all particles arrive at the apparatus .",
    "in fact , around the geomagnetic cut  off the particles are partially transmitted through the earth magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the penumbral bands define forbidden bands of rigidity , which vary with arrival direction , time and geographical location . in this analysis",
    "all these effects are represented by a single transmission function , which was derived from the experimental data .",
    "we found that the caprice94 @xcite and caprice98 helium spectra above about 10  gev / n are nearly identical in shape and the absolute fluxes differ by less than 4% , a good agreement considering statistical errors . moreover , the solar modulation during the two balloon flights was also very similar .",
    "the values from the neutron monitor counter climax @xcite were 415600 counts / hour and 417000 counts / hour at the time of the caprice94 and caprice98 flights , respectively .",
    "the caprice94 experiment took place in north canada at an average geomagnetic cut  off of about 0.5  gv . hence , the effects of the geomagnetic field on the caprice94 proton and helium nuclei spectra were negligible above 1  gv . consequently , the transmission function was defined as the ratio between the helium fluxes measured by caprice98 and caprice94 .",
    "we have made use of this experimentally derived transmission function to obtain the flux of proton and helium nuclei . in figure [ efftrf ]",
    "we have shown the fluxes of proton and helium nuclei as a function of rigidity before and after correcting for the transmission by solid and open symbols respectively , and one can notice that the value of the transmission function decreases from one only below 5  gv .      the contamination of muons , pions and heavy elements in the proton sample was carefully studied , as well as the singly charged particle contamination in the helium nuclei sample .",
    "as said before , no attempt was made to separate deuterons from protons and @xmath23he from @xmath2he .",
    "z@xmath241 particle contamination in the proton sample : : :    the muon and pion contamination in the proton sample was studied using    negatively charged muons recorded at ground before the flight . the    surviving fraction of muons and pions after applying the proton    selection criteria was found to be ( 0.36@xmath00.07)% in the    energy range between 3 and 14  gv . above this rigidity ,",
    "the no  light    selection in the rich was not used and hence , muons and pions were    included in the proton sample above 14 gv .",
    "we neglected this small    contamination in our analysis .",
    "the positron contamination in the    proton sample above 3  gev was negligible and it was neglected in our    analysis .",
    "z@xmath291 particle contamination in the proton sample : : :    heavier particles , mainly helium nuclei , were efficiently rejected by    the scintillator de / dx selection criteria . a test sample selected by",
    "the calorimeter shows that the contamination of heavier elements in    the proton sample was less than 0.2% independent of rigidity .",
    "z@xmath302 particle contamination in the helium nuclei sample : : :    the contamination of charge one particles in the analysis of helium    nuclei was studied by selecting a sample of z@xmath241    particles with the calorimeter . the de / dx scintillator selection    applied to this sample shows a negligible ( @xmath31 0.1% )    contamination .",
    "the contamination of higher z particles was also    negligible , because of the condition on the pulse heigh information on    the top scintillator and because of the small amount of these    particles in the cosmic  rays .",
    "systematic errors originating from the determination of the detector efficiencies have already been discussed in section [ efficiencies ] and they have been included in evaluating the errors associated with flux values , which are shown in the figures and in the tables .",
    "other possible sources of systematic errors are listed below and are also included in the table [ ester ] :    trigger efficiency : : :    the trigger efficiency was studied during the pre  flight preparations    with a system providing particle coincidence between two    scintillators , one placed above the top and the other below the bottom    tof scintillators .",
    "the performance of the trigger system during the    flight was also studied by comparing the experimental spatial    distribution of triggers with the distribution given by the same    simulation , which was used for the geometrical factor calculation , and    an excellent agreement was found . from the pre ",
    "flight measurements ,    the efficiency was found to be close to 100% with an uncertainty of    about 2% .",
    "geometrical factor : : :    the method for calculating the geometrical factor used in this work    was compared with two other techniques in the caprice94 analysis    @xcite , and it was found to be in agreement within 2% above 0.5  gv .    considering the similar geometrical configuration of caprice98 , it can    be concluded that the uncertainty in the geometrical factor was about    2% .",
    "atmospheric secondaries : : :    the estimate of the atmospheric secondaries was made by repeating the    calculations of papini et al .",
    "@xcite using the spectra obtained in    this experiment .",
    "we do not expect the systematic errors in this    estimate to be larger than 10% , that gives a negligible    ( @xmath31 1% ) influence on the results .",
    "the atmospheric    secondaries were also affected by the uncertainty in the residual    atmosphere above the gondola .",
    "the mean residual atmosphere was    measured to be 5.5  g / cm@xmath6  by a pressure sensor owned    and calibrated by the caprice collaboration ; the variation in altitude    during the flight introduces a deviation from the mean of less than    0.3  g / cm@xmath6  .",
    "the pressure was also measured by a    detector owned and calibrated by the national scientific balloon    facility ( nsbf ) .",
    "the nsbf pressure data were about 15% lower ( i.e.    about 4.6  g / cm@xmath6  ) at float than the ones measured by    our sensor .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in the fluxes of less than    1.5% independent of energy .",
    "losses in the atmosphere and payload : : :    the numbers of particles measured at the spectrometer were corrected    for losses in the spectrometer and in the atmosphere . 10% uncertainty    in the cross sections used in these calculations leads to a systematic    error on the proton and helium nuclei fluxes of about 2% from losses    in the payload and the residual atmosphere . an additional uncertainty    of 1% should be considered due to the uncertainty in the atmospheric    depths and the consequent effect on the losses in the atmosphere .",
    "spectrometer resolution : : :    the caprice98 results were not deconvolved for the effect of the    intrinsic spectrometer resolutions since the effect on the measured    fluxes is smaller than the statistical errors . instead a systematic    error has been included that accounts for the finite spectrometer    resolution .",
    "figure [ sigmadef ] shows the distribution of the deflection    uncertainty for protons .",
    "the same method used for the caprice94    experiment , see @xcite , was applied and , assuming as input a power    law spectrum with @xmath32 , the systematic error    found is less than 2% up to 200  gv and reaches 5% at 350  gv on the    fluxes .",
    "other systematic uncertainties due to the tracking system can arise during the flight .",
    "for example , the variation of the temperature can cause a misalignment of the drift chambers , resulting in an offset in the deflection measurement .",
    "another possible source of systematic errors could be a wrongly mapped magnetic field or an error in the centering of the magnet with respect to the drift chambers .",
    "these effects would result again in a wrong measurement of the deflection .",
    "this kind of systematics is discussed below .",
    "tracking system resolution : : :    the high threshold for protons in the rich ( 18  gv ) permitted us to    study several features of the tracking system up to high rigidity . the    momentum resolution for protons using the rich information was    comparable to the resolution of the tracking system up to 50  gv , and    in the region from 19 to 25  gv even superior . the rich detector was    therefore used to cross  check the momentum measurement done by the    tracking system .",
    "it is important to point out that the caprice98    experiment is till now the only balloon or space experiment capable of    cross  checking the rigidity measurement above 5  gv during the flight .",
    "+    the following procedure was used .",
    "the distribution of the cherenkov    angle for protons obtained from flight data in several rigidity bins ,    which were selected with the tracker system , was compared to the    distribution obtained from a simulation . in the simulation",

    "flight data with the magnet off , the resolution    functions of the spectrometer and of the rich system were obtained by    selecting muons ;    * the pressure of the gas inside the rich varied during the flight and    a distribution of the refractive index of the    c@xmath10f@xmath11 gas was obtained from the flight    pressure data ;    * a proton power law spectrum was simulated with a spectral index of    -2.7 .",
    "the rigidity of each simulated proton ,    r@xmath33 , was transformed into deflection , and    after being smeared with the tracking resolution function , it was    transformed back to rigidity ,    r@xmath34 .",
    "* the cherenkov angle for proton was calculated using the simulated    rigidity , r@xmath33 , and a value of the    refractive index was obtained from the distribution of refractive    index from the data .",
    "then the cherenkov angle was smeared according to    the experimental resolution function of the rich .",

    "if an offset existed ,    it was found to be not larger than    7@xmath110@xmath35  gv@xmath5 with    a confidence level of 90% .",
    "+       +    figure [ chere ] shows good agreement between the cherenkov angle    distributions in the case of real data ( dashed lines ) and simulated    ones ( solid lines ) . the upper part of this figure is for the rigidity    bin from 21.4 to 22.9  gv while the lower part is for the rigidity bin    from 40.5 to 53.4  gv .",
    "the long tail toward lower angle in the second    case is due to the effect of the finite resolution of the    spectrometer , indicating the presence of events in that bin with lower    rigidity .",

    "given the number of events selected with the proton and helium criteria ( @xmath36 ) , which were corrected for selection efficiencies , transmission function , losses in the payload and in the atmosphere and for atmospheric secondaries , we obtained the fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from the relation    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the energy bin corrected for ionization losses to the top of the atmosphere and @xmath39 the kinetic energy in the case of protons or kinetic energy per nucleon for helium nuclei .",

    "however , from the flight data , it could have been possible only to cross check the rigidity measurement over a limited rigidity range up to a few gv , where the tof was able to determine the particle velocity .",
    "the calibration of the ams spectrometer was done before and after the flight using proton and pion beams with momentum from 2 to 14  gev / c and during the flight the alignment was monitored with an infrared laser system @xcite . since it was possible to determine an upper limit to the misalignment of the silicon tracker detector , it should be possible to determine an upper limit for an eventual offset in the deflection measurement .",
    "but no systematic error related to the alignment of the silicon plane was considered in the ams data @xcite .",

    ", we may note that the level of agreement among these recent measurements is within 1020% , which is indeed a significant improvement with respect to previous years .",
    "this is particularly important in considering the fact that these results , including that of the caprice98 , are significantly lower than some of the older measurements ( e.g. , webber @xcite not shown in figure [ pflux ] ) .",

    "the caprice98 instrument made it possible to accurately determine efficiencies , rejection power and to estimate systematic errors for each individual detector .",

    "the results are in good agreement with other recent measurements if the systematic errors are properly taken into account",
    ". however , all these results are significantly lower than some of the older measurements .",
    "new space experiments , pamela @xcite in 2003 and ams2 @xcite later on the international space station , will be able to perform the same measurements with better statistics than was done in the past , but the caprice98 instrument will remain a unique detector that joined together a precise superconducting magnet spectrometer and a high threshold gas rich detector , an excellent apparatus to studycosmic  rays .",
