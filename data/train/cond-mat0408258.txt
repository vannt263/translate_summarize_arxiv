    "developments in the synthesis of nano - structured materials is ever expanding the list of structures which may be used for applications . among other things , structures obtained as self - assembled interfaces in lyotropic liquid crystals , which are used as the templates of meso - porous materials , as well as structures made of bent graphites , including carbon nano - fullerenes , are intriguing examples .",
    "these structures are characterized by curved surfaces in nanometer scales and often possess a variety of geometrical properties .",
    "it is interesting to study the electronic properties related to the geometrical properties if the electron is constrained on the curved surfaces , because such unique settings may provide a new phenomena in quantum domain which can be pursued for electronic applications .",
    "we here consider the problem of quantum particle motion constrained on curved surfaces with the tubular topology and cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we start with a model approach developed in refs.@xcite , in which the electron is assumed to be confined strongly to within a thin layer built over the surface . a limiting procedure that brings the thickness of the layer to be zero leads to the hamiltonian in the form of the sum of a laplace - beltrami operator and an effective attractive potential energy associated with the local curvatures .",
    "these terms are written using double curvilinear coordinates on the surface .",
    "the stationary solutions of the schr@xmath1dinger equation are inevitably affected by the metric properties , curvatures , and topology of the surface .",
    "previous studies reported that the effective potential energy can induce bound states whose localization centers are strongly curved parts of the surface .",
    "@xcite the discrete energy levels for bound states usually lie below the lowest edge of the essential ( continuous ) spectrum .",
    "the electronic structures can also be affected substantially by the global topology of the surface , because it restricts the ways in which the electronic wave propagates and interferes .",
    "this point , however , has not been studied comprehensively .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a basic formulation for curved surfaces with the tubular topology and cylindrical symmetry , and also to present some of its outcomes for simple examples .",
    "our attention is focused on the case of tubular surfaces with non - constant diameter , namely , ones with non - vanishing gaussian curvatures .",
    "the geometrical character of the surfaces dealt with in this paper is among the simplest and can be treated with relatively simple mathematics , though the results are not trivial . within our formulation",
    ", it can be readily shown that there can be bound states lying inside the essential spectrum with a different angular momentum .",
    "the analyses of the electronic structures of curved surfaces with more complicated geometries , especially ones so called triply periodic minimal surfaces,@xcite should resort to more elaborated group theoretical techniques .",
    "our formulation is expected to provide some insight into further studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the basic schr@xmath1dinger equation for an electron strongly constrained on a curved surface is summarized briefly.@xcite the equation is applied to a class of tubular surfaces with cylindrical symmetry in section 3 . by symmetry , the basic two - dimensional equation can be reduced to a one - dimensional form , where an axial magnetic field can also be taken into account . in section 4",
    "we study several specific examples and provide the functional form of the potential energy for each case .",
    "these specific problems are solved numerically , where we observe the existence of bound states at the strongly curved region on a surface . for periodically modulated structures",
    ", the relevant one - dimensional band structures as well as charge density distributions along the tubule are calculated .",
    "the electronic structures can be manipulated by tuning the applied magnetic field .",
    "the aharonov - bohm oscillations of the energy levels of the bound states are demonstrated .",
    "further discussions are given in section 5 , and the conclusions in section 6 .",
    "consider a two - dimensional manifold @xmath2 embedded in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath3 and assume a curvilinear surface coordinate system @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) on @xmath2 .",
    "then the metric tensor @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an infinitesimal distance .",
    "we write the principal curvatures as @xmath10 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the quantum mechanics of a single electron which is constrained physically on @xmath2 through a strong confining potential energy is described by the following schr@xmath1dinger equation , @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first term involves the laplace - beltrami operator which describes the propagation of waves through a curved surface with non - euclidean metric .",
    "the second term is the attractive potential energy associated with the local curvature,@xcite which essentially arises from the spread of the wave function perpendicular to the surface and thus is related to the uncertainty principle .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath14 is given by the integral @xmath15 which should be unity for square integrable cases .",
    "static magnetic fields can also be taken into account , in which case the equation becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the components of the magnetic vector potential associated with the coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "now let us consider a class of smoothly curved surfaces with cylindrical symmetry , so that they are invariant under an arbitrary rotation around the @xmath19 axis .",
    "it is convenient to use the cylindrical coordinates @xmath20 , with which the generator for a rotation around the @xmath19-axis is given by @xmath21 , the @xmath19-component of the angular momentum . any of such surfaces can be specified by the set of coordinates @xmath22 as functions of the longitudinal surface coordinate @xmath23 taken perpendicular to the azimuthal coordinate , @xmath24 .",
    "a given value of @xmath23 thus specifies a circle of radius @xmath25 lying on @xmath26 plane . if the function @xmath27 has a monotonic dependence so that it is invertible , then the radius can be expressed as a function of @xmath19 , @xmath28 .",
    "this means that , in describing such a surface , we may use the @xmath19 coordinate as the longitudinal surface coordinate .",
    "we shall treat this particular case in more detail in the following .    for the cylindrical surface specified as @xmath29 , the surface metric @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath31 the principal curvatures of the surface are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 corresponds to the curvature along the longitudinal direction .",
    "we shall consider a magnetic field which is applied to the system parallel to the @xmath19-axis , and suppose its magnitude is given by @xmath34 , a function of the radial coordinate @xmath35 . in the symmetric gauge ,",
    "the vector potential is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total flux passing through a disc of radius @xmath35 .",
    "in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath20 , the relevant components of the vector potential are given by @xmath38 this can be applied for an aharonov - bohm type magnetic field , @xmath39 , as well as a uniform magnetic field , @xmath40 .",
    "the schr@xmath1dinger equation can now be written as @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\psi(z,\\phi ) -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{8m}(\\kappa_1-\\kappa_2)^2\\psi(z,\\phi)=e\\psi(z,\\phi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 commutes with the hamiltonian ( the rotational symmetry ) , we can assume as the form of the solution @xmath44 , in which @xmath0 is the eigenvalue of @xmath43 and can take only integer values in order for the wave function to be single valued .",
    "then the schr@xmath1dinger equation is written as @xmath45\\psi_m(z)\\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{8m}(\\kappa_1-\\kappa_2)^2\\psi_m(z)=e\\psi_m(z ) , \\label{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 this has a sturm - liouville form , @xmath47 + q(z)\\psi_m(z ) = \\epsilon",
    "w(z ) \\psi_m(z ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49w(z),\\\\ w(z)&=&r\\sqrt{1+{r^{\\prime}}^2}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence by introducing the new variable @xmath23 as @xmath50 eq.([equation ] ) can be reduced to a simpler form,@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 eq.([sltr1 ] ) has the form of a one - dimensional schr@xmath1dinger equation with a potential energy @xmath54 , where @xmath23 corresponds to the euclidean line length along a curve on the surface with fixed @xmath24 .",
    "note that the second term in eq.([wm1 ] ) turns out to be @xmath55 , so that all terms including @xmath56 are formally cancelled out in the last expression ( [ wm2 ] ) .",
    "the normalization condition for the wave function @xmath57 is @xmath58 for square integrable cases .",
    "we shall study several particular examples of curved surfaces with cylindrical symmetry by using the formulation presented above .",
    "the first and the simplest example is the catenoid , which gives one of the simplest examples of curved surfaces with zero mean curvature or _ minimal surfaces_. the second example is the tubular surfaces whose diameter changes periodically along the cylindrical axis , in which the diameter function @xmath59 is given by a sinusoidal form .    for each of these simple surfaces , the schr@xmath1dinger equation is solved numerically , using a finite difference method with appropriate boundary conditions . for instance , a dirichlet or neumann boundary condition ( see appendix [ boundary ] ) can be used for the case of the catenoid , while the constant phase increment for bloch states is used for the case of the sinusoidal surface .",
    "the catenoid is defined in its generalized form by the radius function @xmath60 , in which @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) specifies the aspect ratio .",
    "the surface is minimal if and only if @xmath63 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , corresponding to the original definition of the catenoid .",
    "such surfaces can be thought of as simple geometrical models of pore structures common in physical systems .",
    "note that the unit of length is taken as the characteristic depth of the pore.@xcite    the variable @xmath23 defined in eq.([variablex ] ) is given by @xmath64 where the function @xmath65 is the elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "the potential energy function reads @xmath66 where @xmath19 implies a function of @xmath23 .",
    "note that in this expression the radial part and the longitudinal part compete with each other as @xmath61 is varied .",
    "the radial part , which is dominant when @xmath61 is small , decays outside the pore region of unit depth . without magnetic field",
    ", this contribution is negative ( attractive ) for @xmath67 while it is positive ( repulsive ) for @xmath68 .",
    "this is plausible because in a narrow part of the catenoid the contribution of kinetic energy due to alternation of signs of a wave function around the axis becomes costly unless the wave function is effectively repelled from that region .",
    "this part also inherits some attractive contribution associated with the curvatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the longitudinal part is dominant when @xmath61 is large , and it decays rapidly when @xmath23 exceeds @xmath69 .",
    "this is purely the effect of the curvature in the longitudinal direction and independent of @xmath0 as well as the magnetic field .    in the case of @xmath63 ,",
    "the above expressions reduce to @xmath70 and @xmath71 this is the simplest form among the examples we have considered apart from a trivial straight tubule.@xcite several potential energy curves @xmath54 for @xmath63 without magnetic field are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the minimal value of the potential energy for @xmath67 , @xmath72 , is maximal for @xmath63 , so that the two contributions can be said to be balanced for this case .",
    "we have numerically obtained the energy spectrum for the catenoid surfaces with several different values of @xmath61 , where in most cases we have found one or several bound states centered around the constricted part of the surfaces.@xcite the energies of the bound states lie below the continuum @xmath73 . for instance , one bound state is found for @xmath74 without magnetic field and the energy eigenvalue has been numerically estimated to @xmath75 .    for an aharonov - bohm type magnetic field , the magnetic field is non - zero only along the rotational axis , so that the surface is totally field - free .",
    "hence , any solution of eq.([scheqwithb ] ) can be given by a solution of the field free equation , ( [ scheq ] ) multiplied by the phase factor @xmath76 which will affect the boundary condition .",
    "in the case of cylindrical surfaces , this factor is given by @xmath77 which is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "note that the function @xmath78 in eq.([equation ] ) is a constant @xmath79 and the energy spectrum is the superposition of the sub - spectra for all the allowed values of @xmath80 s .",
    "this indicates that the energy spectrum oscillates as a function of flux @xmath81 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) and the period of oscillation is given by : @xmath82 in fig.[fig3 ] we show the energy eigenvalues of bound states as functions of the magnetic flux for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the energy eigenvalue is minimal when the total flux is zero and it increases rapidly with the magnetic flux .",
    "we can also see that the energy spectrum is less sensitive for larger @xmath61 consistent with the fact that the longitudinal part of @xmath54 is field independent . in the case of uniform magnetic field",
    "the oscillation is suppressed for the magnetic flux passing through the tubule is no longer a constant along the axis direction if the radius is not constant .",
    "we next consider the case of infinitely many pores along the tubule .",
    "this is achieved by taking a radius function of the sinusoidal form @xmath86 with @xmath87 ( @xmath62 ) , so that the diameter changes periodically along the axis .",
    "( see fig.[fig4 ] . )",
    "the relevant variable @xmath23 is given by @xmath88 then the effective potential energy curve , @xmath89 will be periodic in @xmath23 ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the solutions of the schr@xmath1dinger equation for fixed @xmath0 conform to bloch s theorem , resulting in the energy bands which depend on geometrical parameters of the tubule .",
    "the total energy spectrum is the superposition of sub - spectra for all @xmath0 s .",
    "the consequences of the modulating diameter of the system is evident from potential energy curves .",
    "those for the case of constant diameter ( straight tubules ) , these functions take merely constant values depending on @xmath0 , posing a constant bias shifts for the energy spectrum . in the case of a tubule with modulating diameter , the effect of modulation ( energy gaps ) is prominent in the lowest part of the spectrum for each @xmath0 . the effect of modulation can also be seen in the charge density distribution profiles shown in fig.[fig6 ] with several different fermi energies . due to the aharonov - bohm oscillation of the electronic structures",
    ", the charge density distribution also changes for different values of magnetic flux enclosed in the tubule .",
    "( fig.[fig7 ] )",
    "the basic equation ( sec.[sec : formltn ] ) assumes hypothetically that the surface has zero thickness and the potential energy within the surface is flat .",
    "one should bear in mind that these assumptions pose essential requirement for the scale of fermi wavelength ( @xmath90 ) ; that is , it should be sufficiently larger than the surface thickness and the average atomic distance along the surface .",
    "this is necessary in order for the motion of an electron perpendicular to the surface to be strongly quantized and for the flat potential approximation to be valid",
    ". the condition would be satisfied if a constrained electronic system is realized using semiconductor hetero - structures ( @xmath91 nm ) or bent carbon graphite sheets@xcite ( @xmath92 nm ) .",
    "on the other hand , the model should be regarded as an excessive oversimplification for curved surfaces made of metallic substances , in which @xmath93 nm .    here",
    "we assume the scale of a pore diameter to be of the order of @xmath94 nm , which is typically the scale of pore structures in mesoporous materials and some of carbon nanotubes .",
    "then the magnetic field should be as large as @xmath95 in order to make the total flux passing through the pore to be @xmath96 .",
    "this is rather large since the largest static field available is about 50 tesla .",
    "the electronic properties could nevertheless change significantly with more moderate field strength if gap openings and/or closings may be induced by the magnetic field .",
    "it might be interesting to point out here that measurements of the aharonov - bohm effect in carbon nanotubes have been achieved recently .",
    "@xcite    in our formulation , the initial schr@xmath1dinger equation reduces to the one - dimensional equations each of which corresponds to an angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 along the cylindrical axis .",
    "the effective potential energy @xmath54 reflects the geometry of the tubule as well as the applied field , so that we may actually create a wide range of one - dimensional potentials by tuning these factors . since the spectra for different @xmath0 s are independent of each other , a bound state for a @xmath0 can exist within the range of the essential spectrum for another @xmath0 .",
    "we have found a simple example with this property in the case of a straight tubule with inflated part , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the response to a change of geometry as well as to an applied field differs among different @xmath0 states , while the fermi energy can cross several partial energy spectra for different @xmath0 s .",
    "one may therefore pursue similar systems for applications such as electronic resonators or a selective stm probe for different @xmath0 states .",
    "note that the possibility of using carbon nanotubes as stm probes has been reported .",
    "@xcite    if we combine multiple tubules together , more profound and interesting effects would be expected due to the interaction between neighboring tubules .",
    "it is also interesting to study more complicated surfaces like triply periodic curved surfaces@xcite which are often encountered in soft matter systems as well as mesoporous materials . in such studies ,",
    "one may focus on the inherent effects of the surface metric , curvatures , symmetry and topology , where our present study may also serve as preliminary information .",
    "we may also pursue the effects of interparticle correlation , which should be essential to understand real systems .",
    "we have formulated the problem of quantum particle motion constrained on curved tubular surfaces with cylindrical symmetry . as the surface has the continuous rotational symmetry ,",
    "the two surface coordinates can be separated and the problem is finally reduced to a one - dimensional differential equation .",
    "magnetic fields parallel to the axis is also taken into account in the formulation .",
    "several examples are studied numerically .",
    "the author would like to thank o. terasaki for his suggestion to investigate similar problems .",
    "he also thanks a. laptev and t. yokosawa for helpful discussions , and t. nakajima for sending useful information .",
    "using the finite difference method , the original equation ( [ sltr1 ] ) can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath61 is the mesh size .",
    "several different boundary conditions have been used to obtain numerical solutions of the one - dimensional schr@xmath1dinger equation .",
    "first , the dirichlet boundary conditions can be used for the case of non - periodic surfaces in which the effective one - dimensional potential energy @xmath54 behaves asymptotically as @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the influence of the cutoff @xmath102 of space variable @xmath23 becomes exponentially small for a bound state which is localized in a sufficiently smaller region than @xmath103 , while it will decrease as @xmath104 for a scattering state . in both cases",
    ", one can estimate the energy spectrum fairly well using this boundary condition with sufficiently large @xmath103 .",
    "if the boundary is far enough from the center , so that @xmath105 , we can improve the precision of the result by taking the neumann boundary conditions instead .",
    "this means we assume the form @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 , where the value of @xmath110 should be determined self - consistently . for the case of periodic sinusoidal surfaces , we may use the usual assumption of bloch states , which will lead to a closed form of matrix equation .",
    "this can be used to obtain the band structures .",
