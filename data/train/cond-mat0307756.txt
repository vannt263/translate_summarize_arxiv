    "from asteroids to nuclei , fragmentation phenomena can be seen everywhere .",
    "many scientists and engineers have been fascinated by the fragmentation process , and much effort has been made to understand fragmentation @xcite .",
    "in particular , impact fragmentation of brittle solids has been investigated by simulation and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the results have shown that cumulative fragment mass ( or size ) distributions exhibit a power - law dependence , in which the exponent depends on the dimensionality of the fractured objects .",
    "these results do not depend on the details of fragmentation , such as the material the fractured object is made from or the fragmentation method .",
    "consequently , oddershede et al . concluded that brittle fragmentation is a self - organized critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "cumulative distributions obey power - law dependence when the imparted energy is sufficiently large , but brittle solids do not break when the imparted energy is very small .",
    "therefore , one might assume that there is a transition in the fragmentation phenomenon .",
    "recently , kun and herrmann examined critical behavior in fragmentation transition and concluded that fragmentation transition belongs to the percolation transition universality class @xcite .",
    "in addition , campi has shown that nuclei fragmentation has the same statistical properties as percolation @xcite .",
    "by contrast , strm et al .  performed other fragmentation model simulations and obtained a scaling law whose critical exponents differ from those of percolation @xcite .",
    "while there are some simulation results , there have been no experiments on critical fragmentation . for a proper analysis ,",
    "the existing simulation results must be compared to experimental data . here , we experimentally investigate brittle fragmentation as a kind of critical phenomenon , and we report experimental results for glass tube fragmentation near the critical point .",
    "figure [ fig : apparatus ] is a schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus .",
    "we used glass tubes ( @xmath1 mm outside diameter , @xmath2 mm thick , and @xmath3 mm , @xmath4 mm , or @xmath1 mm long ) as the fractured objects .",
    "they have 2-d geometry , and it is easy to impart the impact vertically because they can stand by themselves .",
    "kun and herrmann @xcite and strm et al .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulation of 2-d samples .",
    "a glass tube was put in a plastic bag , which was in turn placed between a hard stainless steel stage ( dimensions @xmath5 mm @xmath6 @xmath7 mm @xmath6 @xmath1 mm ) and a stainless steel plate ( @xmath8 mm thick ) .",
    "the stage was fixed by placing heavy weights on it .",
    "a cylindrical brass weight with a flat bottom ( @xmath9 kg ) was dropped on the stainless steel plate vertically , and a planar failure wave propagated to the glass tube from the impact circle ( cross section of the glass tube ) .",
    "consequently , the glass tube was cleaved by the impact .",
    "this is a type of 2-d fragmentation .",
    "four poles ( @xmath8 mm diameter ) were used as guide poles for the falling brass weight .",
    "stoppers for the stainless steel plate were placed at each guide pole to prevent a secondary impact .",
    "while the samples were not annealed after the cutting processing , they had almost the flat end .",
    "we used a level in order to check the verticality between the weight and the stainless steel plate at each fragmentation .",
    "the variable in this experiment was the height that the weight was dropped from .",
    "[ 0.4 ] is the falling height of the weight.,title=\"fig : \" ]    after fragmentation , we collected the fragments in the plastic bag and measured the mass of each fragment with an electronic balance .",
    "the data were analyzed , and cumulative fragment mass distributions were obtained .",
    "we fractured a total of @xmath10 samples ( @xmath11 mm , @xmath12 mm , and @xmath13 mm length ) .",
    "we defined the falling height @xmath14 as a length from the top of stainless steel plate to the bottom of the falling weight . in our experiments , it was set in the range @xmath15 mm @xmath16 @xmath17 mm .",
    "this range corresponds to @xmath18 ( nm / g ) in terms of the imparted energy ( released potential energy of the dropped weight ) per unit sample mass , @xmath19 .",
    "when the height was too low to break the glass tube , no visible cracks were seen .",
    "once a visible crack was produced , fragmentation occurred suddenly .",
    "we defined the point at which a sample began to cleave as the fragmentation critical point .",
    "we could not obtain samples that had only visible macro - cracks , but did not fragment .",
    "we show some photos of fragments in fig .",
    "[ fig : samples ] .",
    "we observed that with a flat impact , low impact energy fragmentation events produced vertical main cracks . therefore , vertical cleaving produces a few , large fragments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : samples](a ) ) . in the mediate range ,",
    "some large fragments remained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : samples](b ) ) . for large impact energy events ,",
    "the largest fragment was smaller , and it was impossible to distinguish the main cracks from the many small fragments by observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : samples](c ) ) .",
    "[ 0.65 ] for ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( nm / g ) , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]      first , we plotted the cumulative mass distribution of each fragmentation .",
    "figure [ fig : cd ] shows some typical cumulative fragment mass distributions , @xmath23 , for @xmath3-mm - long samples .",
    "@xmath23 is defined as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fragment mass and the number of fragments of mass @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the distribution curves for samples of different sizes were similar to the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] .",
    "one can see the clear power - law dependence for fully fragmented samples ( far from the fragmentation transition point ) .",
    "the distribution curves near the critical point do not show clear power - law dependence , and they have a rather flat part .",
    "this tendency is quite different from that of percolation universality . in percolation universality",
    ", the clearest power - law dependence should appear beneath the critical point .",
    "in the fully fragmented data curves , we can observe a region that satisfies @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the obtained value of the characteristic exponent @xmath29 is nearly @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this result conflicts with the scaling ansatz of percolation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe fragmentation criticality to differ from that of percolation .",
    "conversely , our result @xmath32 concurs with strm s result @xcite .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath29 obtained in this experiment is consistent with hayakawa s scaling for 2-d fragmentation with a planar failure wave @xcite .    [ 1.0]-mm - long samples .",
    "power - law behavior is confirmed in the sufficiently high impact energy curves , while the distribution curves for low impact energy do not show a clear trend .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath33 for plus , diamond , triangle , square , and circle marks are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]      since fragmentation events near the fragmentation critical point have less fragments , they can not be analyzed statistically using only @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we used the @xmath39-th order moment of the fragment mass distribution , @xmath40 , defined as @xmath41 since we are interested in fragmentation criticality , the height of the falling weight was controlled near the critical point . despite our control of the height ( imparted energy ) ,",
    "the @xmath40 data fluctuate too much due to individual differences in the glass tube samples , e.g. , the initial density of micro - cracks and residual stress distributions .",
    "when we considered the imparted energy as a control parameter , we could not find clear critical behavior quantitatively .",
    "for example , we show a log - log plot of @xmath42 vs. @xmath19 in fig .  [",
    "fig : am](a ) .",
    "where , @xmath42 is the weighted mean fragment mass .",
    "it is hard to say the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : am](a ) are particularly convincing about showing linear behavior .",
    "we could not consider that power - law fitting was appropriate with confidence .",
    "alternatively , we used multiplicity @xmath33 analysis , which campi introduced to the analysis of nuclei fragmentation @xcite .",
    "multiplicity is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 correspond to the number of fragments , the total mass of the fragments , and the smallest cut - off fragment mass , respectively .",
    "we fix @xmath47 for all the analyses .",
    "this value usually corresponds to the smallest 2-dimensionality for the samples .",
    "according to this definition , the fragmentation critical point corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "while the multiplicity is a resultant parameter , rather than a control parameter , it can be considered the control parameter that incorporates individual differences in the samples . furthermore , because the multiplicity is easy to measure and calculate , it has been applied to other fragmentation systems @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath33 as a pseudo - control - parameter in this paper .",
    "certainly , @xmath33 and the imparted energy are positively correlated , roughly .",
    "the larger the impact energy imparted , the larger @xmath33 becomes .",

    "the criticality appears independent of sample size .",

    "@xmath23 curves have the same power - law , in which the power is @xmath32 .",
    "this value is independent of the size of the samples .",
    "this similarity allows us to collapse the @xmath23 curves of different - sized samples into a unified scaling function .",

    "figure [ fig : sf ] shows good collapse of @xmath23 curves into the scaling function @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the function @xmath58 has a clear power - law regime , in which the power is @xmath0 , and a unified cut - off scale .",
    "the former corresponds to the scaling region and the latter corresponds to exponential decay due to the finite size effect .",
    "accordingly , the scaling function @xmath59 has a constant part and a rapidly decaying part .",
