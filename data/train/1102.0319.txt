    "the gaas / algaas quasi two - dimensional electron system has served as the basis for many interesting developments in modern condensed matter physics.@xcite in the recent past , photo - excited transport studies in this system have become a topic of experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite interest since the observation of zero - resistance states and associated magneto - resistance oscillations in the microwave excited two - dimensional electron system.@xcite .",
    "periodic in @xmath3 radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , which lead into the radiation - induced zero - resistance states , are now understood to be a consequence of radiation - frequency ( @xmath4 ) , and magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) dependent , scattering at impurities @xcite and/or a change in the distribution function,@xcite while vanishing resistance is thought to be an outcome of negative resistance instability and current domain formation.@xcite although there has been much progress in this field , there remain many aspects , such as indications of activated transport , the overlap with quantum hall effect , and the influence of the scattering lifetimes , that could be better understood from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives .",
    "a further topic of experimental interest is to examine the possibility of electron heating , as theory has,@xcite in consistency with common experience , indicated the possibility of microwave - induced electron heating in the high mobility 2des in the regime of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "not surprisingly , under steady state microwave excitation , the 2des can be expected to absorb energy from the radiation field . at the same time",
    ", electron - phonon scattering can serve to dissipate this surplus energy onto the host lattice .",
    "al @xcite have determined the electron temperature , @xmath6 , by balancing the energy dissipation to the lattice and the energy absorption from the radiation field , while including both intra - landau level and inter - landau level processes .",
    "in particular , they showed that the electron temperature , @xmath6 , the longitudinal magnetoresistance , @xmath7 , and the energy absorption rate , @xmath8 , can exhibit remarkable correlated non - monotonic variation vs. @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath10 , with @xmath4 the radiation frequency.@xcite in such a situation , some questions of experimental interest then are : ( a ) how to probe and measure electron heating in the microwave - excited 2des ?",
    "( b ) what is the magnitude of electron heating under typical experimental conditions ? finally , ( c ) is significant electron heating a general characteristic in microwave radiation - induced transport ?",
    "an approach to the characterization of electron - heating could involve a study of the amplitude of the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations , that also occur in @xmath7 in the photo - excited specimen .",
    "typically , sdh oscillations are manifested at higher magnetic fields , @xmath5 , than the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , i.e. , @xmath11 , especially at low microwave frequencies , say @xmath12 at @xmath13 . on the other hand , at higher @xmath4 , sdh oscillations can extend into the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations . in a previous study , ref.@xcite has reported that sdh oscillation amplitude scales linearly with the average background resistance in the vicinity of the radiation - induced resistance minima , indicating the sdh oscillations vanish in proportion to the background resistance at the centers of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states .",
    "kovalev et .",
    "al @xcite have reported the observation of a node in the sdh oscillations at relatively high-@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite discuss sdh damping and a strong suppression of magnetoresistance in a regime where microwaves induce intra - landau - level transitions .",
    "both ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite examined the range of @xmath14 , whereas ref.@xcite examined the @xmath15 regime .    from the theoretical perspective , lei et al .",
    "have suggested that a modulation of sdh oscillation amplitude in @xmath7 results from microwave - electron heating .",
    "further , they have shown that , in @xmath16 regime , both @xmath6 and @xmath8 exhibit similar oscillatory features , while in @xmath17 regime , both @xmath6 and @xmath8 exhibit a relatively flat response .",
    "= 2.5 in    = 2.5 in    = 2.5 in    = 2.5 in    here , we investigate the effect of microwaves on the sdh oscillations over @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the effective electron mass , and @xmath22 is the electron charge@xcite . in particular , we compare the relative change in the sdh oscillation amplitude due to lattice temperature changes in the dark , with changes in the sdh amplitude under microwave excitation at different microwave power levels , at a constant bath temperature .",
    "from such a study , we extract the change in the electron temperature , @xmath23 , induced by microwaves . in good agreement with theory ,",
    "the results indicate @xmath24 over the examined regime .",
    "the lock - in based electrical measurements were performed on hall bar devices fabricated from high quality gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "experiments were carried out with the specimen mounted inside a waveguide and immersed in pumped liquid helium .",
    "the frequency spanned @xmath25 at source power levels @xmath26 .",
    "magnetic - field - sweeps of @xmath7 vs. @xmath27 were carried out at @xmath28 at @xmath29 , and at @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "microwave - induced magneto - resistance oscillations can be seen in fig . 1 at @xmath33 t , as strong sdh oscillations are also observable under both the dark and irradiated conditions for @xmath34 .",
    "over the interval @xmath18 , where the sdh oscillations are observable , one observes small variations in the background @xmath7 at higher power levels .",
    "thus , a smooth @xmath7 background was subtracted from the magneto - resistance data .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) - ( f ) shows the background subtracted @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath35 , measured without ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and with ( fig .",
    "2(b)-2(f ) ) microwave radiation versus the inverse magnetic field , @xmath3 . to extract the amplitude of the sdh oscillations",
    ", we performed a standard nonlinear least square fit ( nlsf ) on @xmath36 data with a exponentially damped sinusoid , i.e. , @xmath37 . here , @xmath38 is the amplitude , @xmath39 is the sdh frequency , and @xmath40 is the damping factor .",
    "the fit results for the dark - specimen @xmath35 data are shown in the fig .",
    "2 ( a ) as a solid line . this panel suggests good agreement between data and fit in the dark condition .",
    "similarly , we performed nlsfs of the @xmath35 sdh data taken with the microwave power spanning approximately @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "2(b)- 2(f ) . since the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 are insensitive to the incident radiation at a constant temperature",
    ", we fixed @xmath40 and @xmath39 to the dark - specimen constant values . in fig .",
    "2 , panels ( b ) @xmath42 ( f ) show the @xmath43 @xmath35 data ( open circles ) and fit ( solid line ) obtained with @xmath44 for different power levels .",
    "the sdh amplitude @xmath38 extracted from the nlsfs are exhibited vs. the microwave power in fig .",
    "here , @xmath38 decreases with increasing microwave power .",
    "our analysis of other power - dependent data ( not shown ) yielded similar results .",
    "next , we examine the influence of temperature on the sdh oscillation amplitude . thus , fig.3(a ) shows @xmath7 vs. @xmath5 with the temperature as a parameter .",
    "it is clear , see the black solid lines , that increasing the temperature rapidly damps the sdh oscillations at these low magnetic fields . in order to extract the sdh amplitude from these data",
    ", we used the same fitting model , @xmath45 , as described previously .",
    "but , for the @xmath46-dependence analysis , @xmath40 was separated into two parts , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , since we wished to relate the change in the sdh amplitude for a temperature increment to the observed change in the sdh amplitude for an increment in the microwave power at a fixed @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath47 represents the damping at the base temperature , and @xmath48 is the additional damping due to the temperature increment , @xmath50 = @xmath51 .",
    "now the fit function becomes @xmath35 = @xmath52 = -@xmath53 .",
    "here , @xmath54 represents the change in the sdh oscillation amplitude due to the @xmath50 .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath39 can be extracted from the @xmath7 fit at the lowest @xmath46 and set to constant values .",
    "data fits to @xmath36 = -@xmath55 are included in fig .",
    "3(a ) as colored solid lines .",
    "thus , the nlsf served to determine @xmath56 at each temperature .",
    "3(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath56 , while the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) shows a semi - log plot of @xmath56 vs. @xmath46 .",
    "the inset confirms an exponential dependence for @xmath56 on @xmath46 , i.e , @xmath57 .",
    "experiments indicate that increasing the source - power monotonically decreases the sdh oscillation amplitude at the examined frequencies including @xmath31 ( see fig.2(g ) ) , @xmath32 and @xmath58 ( see fig.4(a ) ) . since increasing the temperature also decreases the sdh oscillation amplitude ( see fig.3(b ) ) , one might extract the electron temperature change under microwave excitation by inverting the observed relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath46 , i.e. , since @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "thus , the dark measurement of the sdh amplitude vs. the temperature serves to calibrate the temperature scale vs. the sdh amplitude , and the slope of the solid line in fig .",
    "4(b ) reflects the inverse slope of fig .",
    "3(b ) . also plotted as solid symbols in fig.4(b ) are the @xmath38 under microwave excitation at various frequencies and power levels . here",
    ", one observes that the change in sdh amplitude induced by microwave excitation over the available power range is significantly smaller than the change in sdh amplitude induced by a temperature change of 0.9k . by transforming the observed change in @xmath38 between minimum- and maximum- power at each @xmath4 to a @xmath23",
    ", we can extract the maximum @xmath23 induced by photo - excitation at each @xmath4 , and this is plotted in fig.4(c ) . although the power at the sample can vary with @xmath4 , even at the same source power ,",
    "fig.4(c)indicates that the maximum @xmath23 scales approximately linearly with the peak source microwave power ( see fig.4(c ) solid guide line ) . from fig.4(c ) , it appears that @xmath62 .",
    "according to theory,@xcitesteady state microwave excitation can heat a high mobility two - dimensional electron system .",
    "the energy gain from the radiation field is balanced by energy loss to the lattice by electron - phonon scattering . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lei et al .",
    "suggest that longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons provide for more energy dissipation than the transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons in the vicinity of @xmath63 in the gaas / algaas system , if one neglects the surface or interface phonons . at such low temperatures and modest microwave power , away from the cyclotron resonance condition , where the resonantly absorbed power from the microwave radiation is not too large , and the electron temperature remains well below about @xmath64 , the longitudinal optical(lo ) phonons do not influence the resistivity since the energy scale associated with lo - phonons is large compared to the energy scale for acoustic phonons . within their theory , lei et al.@xcite show that the electron temperature follows the absorption rate , exhibiting rapid oscillatory behavior at low @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath65 , followed by slower variation at higher @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath66 . indeed , even at the very high microwave intensities , @xmath67 , e.g. @xmath68 at @xmath32 , theory does not show a significant change in the electron temperature for @xmath69 except at @xmath70 .",
    "thus , theory indicates that the electron temperature is nearly the lattice temperature in low @xmath67 limit especially for @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath71 . in comparison , in these experiments , the source power satisfied @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , while the power at the sample could be as much as ten times lower due to attenuation by the hardware .",
    "remarkably , we observe strong microwave induced resistance oscillations ( see fig.1 ) in the @xmath74 regime at these low intensities .",
    "the results , see fig .",
    "4(c ) , indicate just a small rise , @xmath75 , in the electron temperature , @xmath6 , above the lattice temperature , @xmath46 .",
    "in summary , this experimental study indicates that the perceptible effect of the incident microwave radiation on the amplitude of the sdh oscillations over the regime @xmath2 , when the microwave excitation is sufficient to induce strong microwave induced resistance oscillations , corresponds to a relatively small increase in the electron temperature , in good agreement with theoretical predictions ."
