    "quantum computing constitutes a rich research area of physics and computing at the same time .",
    "it is believed that , the expected power of a quantum computer is derived from genuine quantum resources .",
    "entanglement , and _ correlations _ in general , are typical quantum resources",
    ". however , not all correlations have pure quantum nature .",
    "generically , total correlations are `` mixture '' of classical and quantum correlations .",
    "an important issue is to know to what extent classical correlations are used in teleportation protocols and quantum algorithms .",
    "for example , if one is able to determine the classical part of correlations then by the optimal measurement he can extract some information under in classical form leaving the quantum state with less entropy .",
    "for this procedure to be useful it should be done while retaining the ability to regenerate the source state exactly from the classical measurement result and the post - measurement state of the quantum system .",
    "this has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a possible application of this is to send the post - measurement state through a noiseless channel while sending the classical information through a more robust channel .",
    "quantifying correlations implies measurement in most cases , which is a non trivial task for quantum states .",
    "a general measurement strategy is described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) that decomposes the unity in the hilbert space of the particle under measurement . for the different measures of correlations ( or information )",
    "one has to find the optimal povm , which can be projective ( orthogonal / nonorthogonal ) or non - projective , and then the number of elements in the optimal povm .",
    "povm optimization is studied in different contexts in quantum information theory like the accessible information , the cost function , fidelity , ..... davies theorem @xcite gives an upper bound for the maximum number of elements of an optimal povm needed to attain the * accessible information * ( or the mutual information ) of an ensemble of states in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , this bound is @xmath1 .",
    "the upper bound has been reduced to @xmath2 for states that are real @xcite .",
    "there were attempts to reduce this bound to @xmath0 elements , but shor @xcite has found an ensemble of states in a three dimensional hilbert space that was optimized with six elements povm .",
    "this eliminates the possibility of further reduction of the upper bound .",
    "similar povm optimization was made for the _ fidelity _ in @xcite , where for an ensemble of quantum states in 2-dimensional hilbert the optimal povm was found to have 3 elements , which fits the @xmath2 bound . in the present paper we present a povm optimization for the classical correlations .",
    "the study leads to two important results : for arbitrary binary states projective povm are found to be sufficient to optimize classical correlation which resembles the cases studied in @xcite , on the other hand the optimal povm is found to have at most 4 ( @xmath3 ) elements with indications that the number can be reduced to 3 ( @xmath4 ) for real states .",
    "moreover , for specific states the optimal povm is shown to be orthogonal .",
    "another important property that is shown in the paper is the possibility of decomposing the mutual information contained in a given bipartite system into classical correlation and quantum discord .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the definitions of povm and classical correlation and their physical and mathematical properties are given in the first two sections of the paper .",
    "then we show the natural decomposition of the mutual information into classical correlation and quantum discord .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the complete optimization procedure , including numerical simulation , of the classical correlation for a particular state illustrating the need for the quantum discord in order to match the mutual information .",
    "let @xmath5 be a povm , then @xmath6 should be a positive valued operator , to preserve the positivity of the measurement outcome probability .",
    "each povm  set \" should decompose the unity , to get probability completeness , _",
    "@xmath7 for later use it should be mentioned that the set of all povm s is convex .",
    "_ i.e. _ the _ segment _ joining two povm s is a povm . in simpler terms : if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two povm s and @xmath10 ( a probability ) then @xmath11 is indeed a povm .",
    "unfortunately , there is no unique measure of classical correlations .",
    "different measures are found in the literature @xcite .",
    "two of the most relevant requirements that should be satisfied by any classical correlation are : ( i ) the classical correlations of product states ( @xmath12 ) should be zero .",
    "( ii ) classical correlation should not be affected by local unitary transformations , which corresponds simply to a change of basis .",
    "other important conditions are listed in @xcite .",
    "comparison between different measures is found in the literature .",
    "for example , property ii has been investigated recently by b. synak and m. horodecki @xcite for the measure proposed in @xcite , called the classical information deficit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath13 does increase under local operations .",
    "moreover it was shown @xcite that @xmath13 is bounded above by the classical correlation measure proposed in @xcite .",
    "the only case where @xmath13 is monotone under local operation is when it coincides with the classical correlation of @xcite .",
    "this comparison can be considered to be in favor of the henderson and vedral measure .",
    "however there is no evidence that the other measures of classical correlations violate some of the expected physical properties of a correlation .",
    "so one can choose * a * classical correlation measure out of the proposed measures .",
    "our choice is the henderson and vedral measure .",
    "given the bipartite state @xmath14 a possible measure of the classical correlation between subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath16 is ( @xcite ) @xmath17\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the reduced density matrix .",
    "the von neumann entropy is @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a povm and the sum over @xmath21 runs over all its elements @xmath6 .",
    "the conditional density matrix @xmath22 is the density matrix of @xmath15 after performing the measurement @xmath6 on @xmath16 : @xmath23 the probability of @xmath15 being in the state @xmath22 is @xmath24 .",
    "the correlation measure @xmath25 has a simple physical interpretation : if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not correlated then the marginal entropy of @xmath15 ( @xmath26 ) and the residual entropy of @xmath15 after a povm measurement on @xmath16 ( @xmath27 ) should coincide to give @xmath28 , since for uncorrelated system @xmath29 , @xmath15 is not affected by a povm measurement on @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath30 hence for a * given * povm @xmath20 the combination @xmath31 is closely related to the _ entropy defect _ defined by levitin ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so the classical correlation @xmath25 can be seen as the maximum average decrease in the entropy of the system @xmath15 when a state @xmath22 ( after a measurement @xmath6 is preformed on @xmath16 ) is specified compared with the situation when only the mixture of states @xmath32 is known .    the correlation @xmath33 is obtained from @xmath25 by making the replacement @xmath34 in the above formulas .",
    "it is evident that the measure @xmath35 are not manifestly symmetric under the exchange of the roles of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "whereas , one would expect that the classical correlation is a measure of how strongly the two subsystems are correlated no matter which subsystem is used to extract such a correlation .",
    "hence , until a formal proof of an explicit symmetry of this measure , if it exists , the above proposed measure can not be considered as a universal measure of the existing classical correlations .",
    "in what follows we consider binary states exclusively . extension to higher dimension is not straight forward .",
    "an important property that helps in reducing the range of exploration in the set of all povm s is the concavity @xcite of the classical correlation measure .",
    "if one is able to show that the classical correlation is convex then ( see @xcite ) , for binary states , one can consider povm s of rank one elements that can be taken to be proportional to the one - dimensional projectors .",
    "* proof : *    for binary states the von neumann entropy is concave _ i.e. _ @xmath36 for all @xmath10 .    to study the concavity of the classical measure it suffices to study the variation of the functional @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 where the compact notation : @xmath39 and @xmath40 is used for all elements @xmath6 of the povm @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be two povm s and let @xmath43 be their combination @xmath44 for @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath43 is a povm since , as mentioned before , the set of all povm s is convex .",
    "it is straight forward to show that @xmath45 using these equations and the fact that the entropy is a concave function , it can be shown that @xmath46 therefore , @xmath47 is a convex over the convex set of all povm s .",
    "hence the maximum of @xmath47 occurs for an _ extremal _ povm @xcite . for binary states",
    "it was explicitly shown recently @xcite that extreme povm s are of rank one . hence , to optimize @xmath47 and consequently the classical correlation , since @xmath26 is independent of the povm performed",
    ", one can consider the special class of povm with rank one elements .",
    "hence we are left with projective measurements only .",
    "an important consequence of this result is presented in the next section .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the quantum mutual information @xmath48 of a bipartite system @xmath29 can be decomposed into an information deficit ( or work deficit ) @xmath49 and the classical information deficit @xmath50 is a one - way quantity _",
    "i.e. _ for a system with two parties @xmath15 and @xmath16 we allow communication from @xmath15 to @xmath16 only or vice versa .",
    "this asymmetric definition is analogous to the seemingly asymmetric property of the classical correlations where one has to perform measurements on one of the two parties . ] : @xmath51 so , naturally one should be concerned with an analogous decomposition of the mutual information when using a different measure of classical correlation .    by analyzing different quantum states , the authors of @xcite found that the estimated classical correlation and the relative entropy of entanglement ( @xmath52 ) do not add up to give the von neumann mutual information between the two subsystems , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 it was argued that either the mutual information is not the best quantity to measure the total correlations , or that a more elaborated choice of the povm may saturate the total correlations . by considering all possible povm for a given state ,",
    "we show that the most optimal povm can not saturate the total correlations .",
    "this implies that : either the mutual information is not a good measure of total correlations , which is highly improbable , or one has to change the measure @xmath25 of classical correlation .",
    "the third alternative , which renders the definition of classical correlations compatible with the mutual information , is the possibility of having a different definition of quantum correlations which is different from @xmath52 .",
    "a possible candidate is the quantum discord , which was first defined in @xcite .",
    "it is the result of the difference between classical and quantum conditional entropies .",
    "in contrast to classical conditional entropy , quantum conditional entropy is a measurement dependent quantity ( see further @xcite ) .",
    "the quantum discord is defined as @xcite @xmath54 @xmath55 is the information gained about @xmath16 as a result of the set of measurements @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 were defined originally as the special case of @xmath60 and @xmath22 when the choice of the set of measurement is restricted to one dimensional projectors @xmath61 .",
    "the above definition of the quantum discord reflects clearly the inherited measurement dependence of the quantum conditional entropy .",
    "for the quantum discord to be zero one has to find at least one measurement for which it is zero .",
    "therefore the minimum of the quantum discord is the relevant quantum correlation . by focusing on perfect measurements of @xmath16 , defined by a set of one dimensional projectors , one can easily check that the set of measurements that minimizes the quantum discord , _",
    "i.e. _ maximizes @xmath55 , is exactly the same povm set that optimizes the classical correlations _ for binary states_. this follows from the definition of both quantities , and the result of the previous section on the optimization of classical correlation using projective measurements only .",
    "hence @xmath62 therefore @xmath63 _ i.e. _ _ for binary states the classical correlation and the quantum discord add up to give the mutual information .",
    "_      limiting the domain of exploration in the set of all povm s to projective povm leads to important simplification .",
    "but the game is not over . what would be the optimal projective povm ?",
    "how many elements there are in the optimal povm ?",
    "corollary 1 of @xcite implies that povm s with 5 or more elements acting on a two dimensional hilbert space are not extreme , and hence can not optimize the classical correlation bound found in @xcite . ] .",
    "so , we are left with povm s having @xmath64 or four elements . in the next section",
    "we illustrate , through an example , the steps that can be followed to complete the optimization procedure .",
    "consider a system @xmath29 in a state @xmath14 with probability @xmath65 to be in a state @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be in another state @xmath68 .",
    "a possible example is the following state studied in @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 . to enlarge the `` library '' of computed classical correlations",
    "we will not use the above state but rather a slightly modified version of it , namely @xmath71 the classical correlation of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vederal ] ) was calculated in @xcite using optimization over all _ orthogonal _ measurements , which was not a justified restriction .    for the state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : our ] ) , it is useful to use the pauli matrices decomposition",
    ". hence the measurement operator @xmath6 can be written as : @xmath72 the projection direction is set by the unit vector @xmath73 .",
    "we should further require the completeness relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete ] ) ) : @xmath74 the state @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : our ] ) becomes @xmath75 it is straight forward to show that the density @xmath22 of subsystem @xmath15 , after the measurement @xmath6 on @xmath16 , is @xmath76 where @xmath77 hence the entropy of the subsystem @xmath15 after the measurement @xmath6 of the subsystem @xmath16 is @xmath78 where as usual @xmath79 is the shannon s entropy function and @xmath80 are the eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "the probability @xmath60 to have the subsystem @xmath15 in the state @xmath22 is @xmath81    note that , the same procedure can be applied for the state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vederal ] ) .",
    "one has to replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) .",
    "this change of sign will propagate to all the subsequent equations .",
    "the previous section seems to underline a choice of the basis for projection .",
    "one can argue that the component @xmath84 does not show up in the conditional density matrix @xmath22 , hence we can set it to zero in the projection operator .",
    "in other words measurement can be performed in the @xmath85 plane . in general , this is not correct it was shown in @xcite ( see section iii ) that an extreme povm with four outcomes ( @xmath86 ) can not have its four vectors @xmath73 coplanar .",
    "on the other hand , it is easy to show that the entropy @xmath87 is maximum , _",
    "i.e. _ it is equal to the entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath32 @xmath88 for a projective measurement in the @xmath89 direction , since the state of @xmath16 is completely random in that direction .",
    "however for classical correlations the minimum of @xmath90 is needed not its maximum .",
    "therefore , it is justified to use measurements such that @xmath91 .",
    "hence @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "but , with this assumption the @xmath86 extreme povm is excluded .",
    "this should be investigated further to see whether it is a general property of real states , to which the present state belongs , _",
    "i.e. _ whether optimal povm s for classical correlation of real binary states have at most 3 outcomes in analogy with the @xmath2 bound found in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the proof of @xcite ( see lemma 5 and theorem 1 ) relies on the convexity of the accessible information and some of it scaling properties under group transformation this seems to be equally valid for the classical correlation .",
    "this will be studied in a future work .",
    "but until such a rigorous proof is given the present `` exclusion '' of the @xmath86 case should be considered as a reasonable assumption .",
    "the determination of the classical correlation @xmath25 requires finding a povm that minimizes @xmath90 , given the constraint equations ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "hence a priori we have to explore all possible povm s and then picking up the one that minimizes the considered sum .",
    "the result of section [ sec : concavity ] has limited the domain of exploration to projective povm only .",
    "the optimization problem can be done using the lagrange multipliers method .",
    "it is more convenient to recast the problem as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96h(\\omega_i^{(1)}(\\theta_i))\\ ; .\\ ] ] let @xmath97 be the lagrange multipliers associated with the above constraints .",
    "hence the minimization problem is equivalent to find the values of @xmath98 satisfying @xmath99 this optimization should be done for @xmath100 .      for two - elements povm ( @xmath101 )",
    "we recover the orthogonal projective measurement , it is straight forward to check that the optimal povm measurement is indeed projective , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath102 and @xmath103 , with the bases of measurement parameterized by @xmath104 as @xmath105 ] , since @xmath106 .",
    "hence @xmath107 .",
    "best _ measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ the optimal measurement among the @xmath101 povm s only , is obtained when @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the _ best _ set of measurement is a two - shot measurements with opposite directions .",
    "this should be solved numerically for each @xmath65 .",
    "the result is plotted in figure [ fig : correl ] .",
    "our result matches well with the result of @xcite .",
    "this implies that although our state is slightly different from the state they have studied but the two states have the same classical correlations .",
    "however , as mentioned before , this is just the orthogonal measurement , non orthogonal measurements should be considered which was not done in @xcite .",
    "finding the minimum by the method presented above ( method 1 ) for @xmath109 seems to be a non trivial task , however , it is possible to use a different method like the monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) method .",
    "we generate random events that correspond to the set of the 3 angles @xmath110 , while from eq .",
    "[ 1 ] the three @xmath111 s are no longer independent variables .",
    "thus our strategy is to compute the classical correlations for each randomly generated event . to each event",
    "a numerical value is obtained for the classical correlation , for a given @xmath65 , this is is represented by the large number of points ( forming long continuous strips ) in fig . [ fig : correl ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl ] we plot the simulation outputs for @xmath112 events .",
    "clearly the classical correlation predicted for the _ best _ orthogonal projective measurement case constitutes the upper limit of all the results obtained for the random events .",
    "hence * the * optimal povm , among all possible povm s , is the two - outcomes orthogonal projective povm .",
    "this result can be linked to the remark found in the conclusion of @xcite that one should dare conjecture the following : orthogonal measurement is optimal whenever the number of states ( the two states @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the present case ) does not exceed the dimensionality of the state space .      to understand the role of the classical correlations and its compatibility with the mutual information , the mutual information is evaluated using the formula @xmath115 for the present state of the system @xmath29 the mutual information can be easily calculated to obtain : @xmath116 @xmath117 ) is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : correl ] besides the classical correlation obtained by the optimal orthogonal projective measurement and the one generated by mcs .",
    "since @xmath14 is separable , then its relative entropy of entanglement is zero .",
    "therefore , from our general povm analysis , and as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : correl ] , no povm can lead to classical correlation that saturates , when added to the relative entropy of entanglement , the mutual information between the two subsystems .",
    "this confirms the necessity to use the quantum discord as a quantum counter part for the classical correlation used in this paper rather than the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "by considering a generic povm we show that classical correlations of binary states are optimized via projective povm .",
    "it is found that the classical correlation and the quantum discord add up to give the mutual quantum information .",
    "this work should be considered as a first step towards a generalization of the povm optimization for states in higher dimensions and to see whether rank one povm elements are still the optimal choice for classical correlation .",
    "moreover , there is at present strong evidence on the possibility of an experimental realization of non projective povm using optical devices as was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "this gives a new dimension to povm optimization .",
