    "in classical mechanics the metric of a space - time can be definitely determined from trajectories of particles , and the metric tensor is the physical degrees of freedom of the general relativity . in quantum theory , however , the existence of minimal length in semi - classical quantum gravity and string theory @xcite and another series of arguments @xcite suggest that the metric can not be definitely determined and is not an appropriate tool to describe a space - time at fundamental level .",
    "this is similar in a fuzzy space @xcite , and a metric is just what determines the low - frequency dynamics of the fields in it .",
    "even though such an effective metric is not fundamental , it would be useful in understanding the gravitational properties of a fuzzy space .    in continuum theory ,",
    "the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the trace of a heat kernel @xmath0 for @xmath1 are given by the integrals of the local geometric invariants over a space @xcite .",
    "therefore , the heat kernel expansion applied to a fuzzy space may contain the information on its effective geometric properties .",
    "the heat kernel expansion for a non - commutative torus with the groenewold - moyal star product was studied in @xcite .",
    "the author has found a power - law asymptotic expansion for @xmath1 , and the heat trace coefficients in this case are fully defined by the heat trace expansion for ordinary but non - abelian operators . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the present author studied the heat trace for a compact fuzzy space . for a compact fuzzy space ,",
    "it is not appropriate to consider an asymptotic expansion for @xmath1 because of its finiteness .",
    "it was shown that the effective geometric quantities in a compact fuzzy space are found as the coefficients of an approximate power - law expansion of the trace of a heat kernel valid for intermediate values of @xmath2 .",
    "an efficient method to obtain these coefficients was presented and applied to some known fuzzy spaces to show the validity of the method .",
    "the effective geometric quantities studied in the previous paper @xcite are global . in the present paper ,",
    "the method will be applied to @xmath3 with the insertion of the operator @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 has a local support in a fuzzy space , the method will provide the effective local geometric quantities in a fuzzy space .",
    "i will consider some fuzzy spaces including those corresponding to singular spaces in continuum theory .",
    "since a fuzzy space smoothens the singularities of a continuum space , it would be interesting to see the behavior of the local geometric quantities obtained by the method near the singularities in continuum theory .    in the following section , i recapitulate the method presented in the previous paper @xcite , and generalize it to include the insertion of @xmath4 and boundaries . in section[global",
    "] , i study the effective global geometric quantities in fuzzy @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a fuzzy line segment . in all the cases ,",
    "the method works well . in section[local ] , the effective local geometric quantities are studied for the same fuzzy spaces .",
    "the method works well , but some complications appear in some of them .",
    "the fuzzy @xmath6 obtained through the reduction from the fuzzy @xmath8 turns out to be inappropriate , and the fuzzy @xmath6 defined by a non - associative algebra is used instead .",
    "the local geometric quantities of the fuzzy line segment are hard to be determined because of the strong singularities at its boundaries .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in continuum theory , the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel has the geometric quantities as its coefficients @xcite . for a smooth function @xmath4 and a laplacian @xmath9 in a space with no boundaries ,",
    "the asymptotic expansion for @xmath1 is given by for the coefficients in the present paper is distinct from the previous one @xcite , but it is the one used in the references @xcite . ] [ asymp ]",
    "tr(h e^-ta)_j=0^t^j-/2 a_2j(h ) , where @xmath10 is the dimension of the space , and [ avalues ] a_0(h)&=&d^x  h , a_2(h)&=&d^x   h6 , + a_4(h)&=&d^x  h ( r^abcdr_abcd - r^abr_ab+r^2-_a ^a r),for @xmath11 . therefore ,",
    "if a laplacian is given , one can obtain some geometric quantities and the dimension through the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace @xmath3 .    for a compact fuzzy space , since the number of independent modes is finite , @xmath3 is a well - defined function on the entire complex plane of @xmath2",
    ". therefore the behavior of @xmath3 is not comparable with the asymptotic expansion of continuum theory .",
    "however it is generally expected that the continuum description is valid well over the scale of fuzziness . in the previous paper @xcite , the heat trace without the operator insertion ( @xmath12 )",
    "was studied for some known fuzzy spaces .",
    "it was shown that @xmath0 is comparable with the expansion in an intermediate range @xmath13 , and the effective geometric quantities can be obtained through the method explained below .",
    "the minimum value @xmath14 comes from the scale over which the fuzziness can be well neglected and the description with an effective metric holds well , while the maximum value @xmath15 comes from the whole size of a fuzzy space .    since the qualitative form of the asymptotic expansion in continuum theory does not change with the insertion of @xmath4 , the method presented in the previous paper @xcite can be used without any essential modifications .",
    "following @xcite , let me define a function [ defoff ] f_h(t)=t^/2 tr(h e^-ta ) .",
    "then the ` coefficient functions ' are defined by [ coefffun ] a_h,2j^n(t)=_ij^n-1 f_h^(i)(t ) , where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17-th derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath2 .    in @xcite , the global case ( @xmath12 ) is considered and it was explicitly checked for some fuzzy spaces that , with a reasonable choice of @xmath19 , the coefficient functions @xmath20 take nearly constant values in a certain range @xmath13 , and that these values can be identified as the effective geometric quantities in a fuzzy space corresponding to the coefficients @xmath21 in of continuum theory .",
    "the intermediate range @xmath13 will be denoted by the ` stable region ' in this paper .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath22 depend not only on the reference scale @xmath2 but also on @xmath19 , the number of derivatives considered .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite , this @xmath19 parameterizes the order of the taylor expansion of @xmath18 about the reference scale @xmath2 , and describes the tolerance for the approximation of @xmath18 with a power - law expansion . to compare the asymptotic expansion with the behavior of @xmath3 of a fuzzy space , a certain amount of tolerance must be allowed .",
    "this is because the spectra of the laplacian in a fuzzy space do not rigorously agrees with those of a continuum theory . the tolerance is tighter for larger @xmath19",
    "therefore , the parameter range @xmath13 of the stable region depends on @xmath19 , and the stable region becomes smaller for larger @xmath19 . in the limit @xmath23",
    ", the stable region disappears .",
    "the above property of the coefficient functions makes it a delicate matter how to choose the values of @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath19 is too small , the approximation of @xmath18 with a power - law approximation will be too bad to provide the accurate effective geometric quantities , while , if @xmath19 is too large , the stable region can not be found and no effective geometric quantities can be obtained as explained above .",
    "fortunately , the dependence on @xmath19 is not so large at least for the fuzzy spaces studied in the previous paper @xcite . in a broad range of @xmath19",
    ", there exists the stable region and the reasonable values of the effective geometric quantities can be found .",
    "a mathematically more rigorous criterion for the choice of the values of @xmath19 should be formulated in future study , but , in the present paper , i will just take one of the values of @xmath19 with the existence of the stable region for each specific case .",
    "the heat kernel expansion in a space with boundaries has additional contributions from the boundaries , and it is in powers of @xmath24 @xcite : [ asymphalf ] tr(h",
    "e^-ta)_j=0^t^(j-)/2 a_j(h ) . therefore ,",
    "the coefficient functions for a fuzzy space with boundaries are defined as [ coefffunb ] a_h , j^b , n(t)=_ij^n-1 , where the argument of @xmath18 defined in is replaced with @xmath25 .",
    "these coefficient functions will be used in the study of fuzzy @xmath7 .",
    "in this section , @xmath12 is taken to study the global geometric quantities .",
    "the coefficient functions are determined from the spectra of the laplacian @xmath26 and their degeneracy , since the heat kernel trace is expressed as [ globalheatexp ] tr(e^-ta)=_l",
    "d(l ) e^-a(l ) t , where @xmath27 labels the spectra , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the degeneracy and the spectra of @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the present method was already applied to the global geometric properties of some regular fuzzy spaces in the previous paper @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the main motivation of this paper resides in the application to the fuzzy spaces corresponding to singular spaces in continuum theory and the behavior of the local geometric quantities investigated in the next section .",
    "i will study fuzzy @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a fuzzy line segment .",
    "in all the examples , the global properties are well obtained through the method , while the local properties of some of them show complications .      in @xcite ,",
    "fuzzy @xmath5 is constructed by taking a subalgebra of the fuzzy @xmath8 algebra @xcite . when fuzzy @xmath8 is constructed on the spin @xmath31 representation of the @xmath32 algebra",

    "however , since the algebra of the modes describes a certain aspect of the structure of a fuzzy space , it would be more reasonable to determine the laplacian from the algebra through a principle . one way to achieve this",
    "would be starting with the non - commutative differential geometry @xcite .",
    "another unsatisfactory treatment in this paper is that the choices of the local insertion operator @xmath4 are not fully derived . for the simple fuzzy spaces studied in this paper , the natural intuitive choices work well , and there would be no many other reasonable choices . but this will not be true for general fuzzy spaces .",
