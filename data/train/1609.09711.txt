    "many physical and biological systems share the property of being composed of irregular polyhedra subject to some form of energy minimization .",
    "the microstructures of polycrystalline materials in general and of metals in particular @xcite often serve as motivating examples , and can be modeled as resulting from a process of three - dimensional grain growth subject to isotropic boundary energies and mobilities @xcite .",
    "a portion of the resulting simulated microstructure is given in figure  [ fig:3d_microstructure ] , with some isolated grains displayed in figure  [ fig : single_grains ] .",
    "an investigation of these figures reveals several significant features .",
    "first , the networks of edges on the surface of the grains are connected in many different ways ( i.e. , the number of topological types is large ) .",
    "while this could be explained as the result of some inherent disorder in a physical system that is constrained to be space - filling , the distribution of topological types has been observed to be far from random @xcite .",
    "still , relatively little is currently known about why certain types appear more frequently than others .",
    "second , the examples in figure  [ fig : single_grains ] show that many of the grains appear to be geometrically round , in the sense of the surface to volume ratio .",
    "this could be explained as the result of energy minimization , since the energy of the model system is proportional to the sum of the surface areas of the grains .",
    "a reasonable question would be whether this property is related to the observed distribution of topological types ( e.g. , the topological types in a material with equiaxed grains are likely different from those in a material with extruded grains ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , some language and concepts inspired by combinatorial topology are introduced to make the discussion and classification of the topological types of grains more precise , and to provide a framework to compare the distribution of topological types in different systems .",
    "these are intended to be generally useful for the analysis of cellular structures .",
    "data from simulations suggest that the dynamics of grain growth in real space induce dynamics on the space of topological types , involving the switching of edges and the creation and deletion of triangular faces .",
    "the second purpose of the paper is to offer a preliminary description of these dynamics .",
    "third , a detailed investigation of the evolution of a microstructure from a typical initial condition reveals a point where the grains appear to be particularly round in a specific combinatorial sense .",
    "this seems to result from triangular faces in the initial condition disappearing before triangular faces on tetrahedral grains can appear in comparable numbers .",
    "the possibility that this microstructure is particularly stable to thermal coarsening suggests a further investigation into the properties of the corresponding experimental microstructure .",
    "a _ three - dimensional polytope _ ( @xmath1-polytope ) is defined as a three - dimensional convex hull of finitely many points in three - dimensional space . with only a few degenerate exceptions ( described in section  [ sec : extremal ] ) , most of the grains observed in the simulated grain growth microstructures ( or in other space - filling cellular structures , e.g.  foam structures @xcite ) have the combinatorial types of _ simple _ @xmath1-polytopes .",
    "these have the property that exactly three boundary faces meet at each boundary vertex .",
    "similarly , a space - filling three - dimensional microstructure is _ simple _ if exactly four cells meet at each vertex and three cells meet at each edge .",

    "the tetrahedron is the only simple @xmath1-polytope that is self - dual , and as such it is both simple and simplicial .",
    "while the combinatorial types of the cube and the octahedron are clear from figure  [ fig : schlegel_and_dual ] , the combinatorial types of more complicated @xmath1-polytopes can be difficult to visualize from the embeddings .",
    "the _ schlegel diagrams _ at the bottom of figure  [ fig : schlegel_and_dual ] are often more convenient to show the combinatorial type of a @xmath1-polytope .",
    "this diagram is constructed by projecting the boundary of a polytope onto one of the faces in such a way that vertices not belonging to the face lie inside it , and no two edges cross @xcite .",
    "all simple @xmath1-polytopes belong to one of three classes , identified by the following characteristics :    * four triangular faces ( the tetrahedron ) , * more than four faces and no triangular faces , * more than four faces and some triangular faces .",
    "truncating any corner of a simple @xmath1-polytope in the first or second classes gives a simple @xmath1-polytope in the third class , and any simple @xmath1-polytope in the third class can be constructed in this way .",
    "this suggests the following definition :    a simple @xmath1-polytope is _ fundamental _ if it can not be obtained by truncating a corner of a simple @xmath1-polytope with fewer faces , and is _ vertex - truncated _ otherwise .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : introduction ] , the polytopes belonging to physical systems subject to energy minimization often appear to be geometrically round . if a characteristic combinatorial feature of these polytopes could be found , then that could motivate a corresponding notion of combinatorial roundness . for this purpose ,",

    "this makes the fraction of triangular faces depend on the relative rates of the interacting topological operations in a complicated way .",

    "this raises a reasonable question about the independence of the statistics reported in this section to errors introduced by implementation details and finite precision arithmetic .",
    "consider the effect of a fixed rate of topological edge errors per grain on the frequency of round@xmath129 grains .",
    "starting from the evolved data set with 268,402 grains , every grain is subjected to a fixed number of edge flips selected uniformly at random from the set of admissible edges ( ones that do not give a degenerated grain ) .",
    "note that the presence of combinatorial symmetries means that distinct flips can sometimes give the same combinatorial type , or even leave the combinatorial type unchanged .",

    "since the fraction of edges in the evolved microstructure with less than one - tenth the average length is about @xmath151 and a grain in the evolved microstructure has about @xmath152 edges @xcite , there is roughly one error candidate per grain .",
    "that said , this is a is very conservative estimate , the actual average number of edge errors per grain is likely much less than one , and this source of error is unlikely to significantly change the reported statistics .",
    "we take this opportunity to further observe that increasing the number of edge errors per grain to two or three causes the frequencies of round@xmath129 grains to move in the direction of those of the poisson ",

    "the present proposal is restricted to flag@xmath6 simple @xmath1-polytopes since this is the main class considered in the previous sections , and the topology of these polytopes is relatively well constrained .    as explained in section [ sec : polytopal ] , one of the characteristics of a flag@xmath6 simple @xmath1-polytope is the absence of non - trivial @xmath1-belts .",

    "in fact , the examples of the kelvin foam and the weaire ",
    "phelan foam show that the frequency of a polytope can not , in general , be a function of combinatorial information alone . instead , a penalty function is proposed , where the penalty increases with the number of faces and with the constriction as quantified by belts of faces around the polytope .",
    "this is intended to assign a value to the difficulty of accommodating the polytope in a space - filling microstructure , and ( per figure [ fig : penalty ] ) seems to function as an upper bound for the frequency of the polytope .",

    "<S> grain growth microstructures are composed of polyhedral cells of varying sizes and shapes . </S>",
    "<S> these structures are simple in the sense that no more than three faces meet at an edge and no more than four edges meet at a vertex . </S>",
    "<S> individual cells can thus be considered ( with few degenerated exceptions ) as simple , three - dimensional polyhedra . </S>",
    "<S> a question of recent interest involves determining the distribution of combinatorial types of such polyhedral cells . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the terms _ fundamental _ and _ vertex - truncated _ types and demonstrate that most grains are of particular fundamental types , whereas the frequency of vertex - truncated types decreases exponentially with the number of truncations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the evolutionary process through which grain growth structures are formed , and in which energetically unfavorable surfaces are quickly eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe that these grain types are ` round ' in a combinatorial sense : there are no ` short ' separating cycles that partition the polyhedra into two parts of similar sizes . </S>",

    "<S> voronoi initial condition is identified as containing an unusually large proportion of round grains . </S>",
    "<S> this round microstructure has an average of @xmath0 faces per grain , and is conjectured to be more resistant to topological change than the steady - state grain growth microstructure . </S>"
