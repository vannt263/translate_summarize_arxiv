    "the interest in the nuclear responses at intermediate energies , in particular in the quasi - elastic peak ( qep ) region , is still widespread : indeed , the body of experimental data presently available in this energy regime is not easily amenable to a unified and consistent understanding .",
    "for example , the maxima of the ( p , n ) cross - sections @xcite appear hardened , over a wide range of momentum transfers , by about 25  mev with respect to the ones observed in the ( p , p@xmath2 ) reaction @xcite , an outcome still waiting for a convincing interpretation in terms of either many - body or reaction - mechanism effects .",
    "the issue is further complicated by the experiments with heavier probes : in fact , the hardening of the qep position found in the ( @xmath3he , t ) @xcite and in the ( d,2p ) @xcite reactions at low transferred momenta turns into a softening when the momentum transfer is increased .",
    "although this behaviour might be related to the composite nature of the probes , it is notable that the same effect it is observed also in pion single charge - exchange reactions @xcite . on the other hand , the predicted hardening of the isovector transverse @xmath4@xmath5 response appears well established according to the available data of deep inelastic ( e , e@xmath2 ) scattering @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall mainly concentrate on the @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath4@xmath5 isovector channels .",
    "actually , some evaluations of the spin - isospin ( @xmath7 ) responses have already been performed in the framework of the bound state @xcite or continuum @xcite random phase approximation ( rpa ) with the conventional particle - hole ( ph ) interaction for the @xmath7 channel . as it is well known ,",
    "the latter includes , beside the landau - migdal parameter @xmath8 ( or , equivalently , a short range interaction of some sort ) , the exchange of the pion and the rho meson .",
    "a suitable test for these calculations is represented by the above mentioned data of deep inelastic electron scattering , where the @xmath4@xmath5 response has been separated out in a few nuclei over a wide range of momentum transfers . here",
    "the virtual photon is exploring the whole of the nucleus , which thus has all its constituents responding to the probe .",
    "when , however , one comes to consider strongly interacting probes , the ones offering a real hope of disentangling the elusive @xmath4@xmath6 response , the additional problem is faced of appropriately dealing with the reaction mechanism , or , in other words , with the distortion of the impinging and outgoing hadronic waves .",
    "this is essential , since here the response of the nucleus is mostly confined to the surface region and one has to accurately assess how much of the latter is actually involved in the process .    in this connection",
    ", the authors of ref .  @xcite resorted to the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , whereas in refs",
    ".  @xcite the glauber theory @xcite in the one - step approximation was employed .",
    "the former approach , as it is well - known , is fully quantum - mechanical ; however , in the high energy limit and for nearly forward scattering the dwba practically coincides with the eikonal approximation and thus is equivalent to the glauber theory : but the latter allows one to deal with multistep processes , which are likely to give a substantial contribution at large momentum and energy transfers .",
    "this is indeed what happens and we shall explore the contribution the two - step processes provide , particularly in charge - exchange reactions , where their importance is expected to be greater .    turning to the many - body aspect of the problem ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath7 nuclear responses in the continuum rpa with the ( @xmath9 ) ph interaction , but utilizing a method different from the one originally proposed by shlomo and bertsch @xcite , which has been widely exploited in this kind of calculations .",
    "our approach is entirely worked out in momentum rather than in coordinate space and allows one to incorporate in a natural way the spreading width of the ph states .",
    "in fact , continuum rpa naturally accounts for the escape width of the particle states , ignored , instead , in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "however , the spreading width of the states is also quite important for a realistic description of the @xmath7 responses .",
    "the inclusion of the latter is achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite through the direct introduction of an optical potential in the schroedinger equation for the single particle ( but not for the hole ) states .",
    "the disadvantage of such an approach lies in the ensuing lack of orthogonality between the single particle wave functions that needs then to be cured with a rather cumbersome procedure @xcite .",
    "alternatively , smith and wambach @xcite introduced a phenomenological complex and energy - dependent self - energy that directly couples the ph to the 2p2h sector of the hilbert space , a procedure that should simulate the much more computer - time consuming second rpa ( srpa ) @xcite .",
    "we adopt here an analogous approach : however ,",
    "instead of introducing the coupling at the level of the rpa eigenstates we do so at the level of the bare ph states and _ then _ proceed to the construction of the rpa solution .",
    "the two approaches differ since the validity of the former requires the near diagonality and state independence of the `` collective '' self - energy in the rpa basis , whereas in the latter the ph self - energy in the ph basis is required to be almost diagonal .",
    "notably , the two frameworks lead to quite similar results , as far as the nuclear response is concerned .    in this paper",
    "we shall test the above outlined model against deep inelastic electron scattering data ( _ volume responses _ ) on @xmath10ca as obtained in saclay @xcite .",
    "for the _ surface responses _ we shall analyze the data obtained with the charge exchange ( p , n ) reaction at los alamos @xcite .",
    "we shall consider as well the ( p , p@xmath2 ) data @xcite . in both cases",
    "the proton probe has an energy of 795 mev .",
    "this set of data represents a large body of what is nowadays available on the experimental side .",
    "we do not analyze here the ( d,2p ) and ( @xmath3he , t ) data ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the internal structure of composite probes would require an appropriate treatment , since it has a strong impact on how the probe s and target s spins are coupled @xcite , and might also qualitatively influence the distortion effects @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the two calculations are in fact in substantial agreement . note also that these correlations , related to the single - particle motion , affect the position of the qep much less than the rpa ones .",

    "it is unlikely that this shortcoming be due to the specific model we employ for the ph interaction : in our treatment the landau - migdal parameter @xmath8 incorporates the effect of the exchange diagrams in the rpa series and this approximation is known to work well in the spin - isospin channel @xcite .",
    "thus , to improve the accord with experiment , further contributions to the response function should likely be looked for beyond the ph hilbert space of rpa , such as 2p-2h and meson exchange current terms .",
    "this is further suggested by the fact that in the high energy region of the response some strength is missing even at high momenta , where the strength of the qep is fairly close to the data .",

    "furthermore , another effect shows up , of great importance for the interpretation of the experimental data , namely a shift of the qep position of the surface responses with respect to the volume ones : it appears to be sizable ( due to the fact that rpa correlations are damped , it is much larger than the shift induced by the latter ) and practically independent of @xmath113 in any realistic range of values for this parameter .",
    "it also turns out to be independent of the elementary nn amplitudes ( here we employ the parameterization of bugg and wilkin @xcite ) .",
    "however , comparing the results for @xmath149c and @xmath10ca , one also observes a shell dependence for this effect : this is better illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the surface longitudinal response functions for @xmath149c and @xmath10ca are directly compared for the case @xmath162 mb at @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath158 , both with and without inclusion of the spreading width . in order to bring the responses at the same scale",
    ", @xmath163 has been divided by @xmath164 ( see ( [ eq : d1 ] ) ) , with @xmath165c@xmath166 and @xmath165ca@xmath167 , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the @xmath10ca one - step surface responses are hardened for @xmath168 @xmath158 and softened for @xmath169 @xmath158 ; in contrast , @xmath149c surface responses are always hardened , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . furthermore",
    ", this feature is independent of the specific value of @xmath113 , which is dictated by the energy and the nature of the projectile .",
    "a contribution that might , in principle , reshape the quasi - elastic response functions is the two - step term in the glauber multiple scattering expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite it had been shown to produce at small transferred momenta a contribution smoothly increasing with the transferred energy . however , this feature , because of the nn amplitudes entering into ( [ eq : r2lt ] ) and ( [ eq : r200 ] ) , is strongly dependent upon the momentum regime .    to figure it out , we plot in fig .  [ fig7 ]",
    "the two - step response @xmath170 for a simple model , namely assuming the two squared amplitudes in ( [ eq : r200 ] ) to be equal and with a gaussian shape , @xmath171 . here , and also in the following calculations with realistic nn amplitudes , in order to estimate @xmath170 we use for simplicity the free harmonic oscillator model without inclusion of the spreading width",
    ": since @xmath170 is the convolution of two ph response functions , it should be rather independent of the details of their shape .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] correspond to @xmath172 ranging from 0.001 @xmath173 to 1 @xmath173 and it is quite apparent that the shape changes when the @xmath39-dependence of the amplitudes becomes more pronounced .",
    "the reason for this behaviour lies in ( [ eq : r200 ] ) : indeed , when @xmath174 is a rapidly decreasing function , the main contribution to the integrals comes from the region @xmath175 and , as a consequence , @xmath176 ; it then follows that at fixed @xmath39 the maximum of @xmath177 will be found for @xmath178 around the qep position .",
    "note that for @xmath179 @xmath173 one gets , at high momenta , a maximum _ below _ the qep and that realistic values for @xmath172 , which fit the nn amplitudes , fall just in this range .",
    "let us now see how our full model ( namely one - step rpa glauber responses with spreading width plus two - step free responses ) compares to the available ( @xmath180,@xmath181 ) data @xcite .",
    "the double differential cross - section for a ( @xmath180,@xmath181 ) reaction is given by @xmath182    \\label{eq : csa}\\ ] ] and it is tested in fig .",

    "the dashed and the solid curves in each plot represent the one - step and the full calculations , respectively , whereas the dotted curve is the two - step term ; for sake of comparison , we display also the cross - section corresponding to the simpler model based on the one - step contribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r1lt ] ) ( dot - dashed line ) , i.  e. @xmath187 .",
    "\\label{eq : csb}\\ ] ]    a few comments are in order .",
    "first , the reduction in strength in going from ( [ eq : csa ] ) to ( [ eq : csb ] ) is due to rpa correlations ( indeed , the difference fades away at large @xmath39 ) , whereas the shift in the qep position comes from the cylindrical geometry of the reaction , which is respected by our approach ( it stays constant with @xmath39 ) .",
    "looking at the data , it is apparent that now the situation is complementary to what we have observed in the case of the ( @xmath188,@xmath189 ) data : in fact , we are now able to reproduce the correct @xmath39-dependence of the strength , but not the qep position of the ( p , n ) data , which is still somewhat more hardened than predicted by our calculations .    note that the height of the peak depends on @xmath190 : here , we have used @xmath191  mb , without accounting for medium effects on this parameter .",
    "the estimate of this effective parameter is not well assessed , since there are large discrepancies between the direct calculation of pauli blocking effects @xcite  and the derivation of @xmath190 from the optical potential @xcite .",
    "using @xmath192  mb , the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] would get a 25%  increasing at any momentum transfer , without affecting the @xmath39-dependence of the strength and reproducing correctly also the height of the peak .",
    "the real problem with the model we are discussing is related to the @xmath96-dependence of the qep position that it introduces ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) , since the ( p , n ) data of ref .",
    "@xcite appear to scale , at least in @xmath149c and pb .",
    "a scale factor is also the only difference in the ( @xmath3he , t ) cross - sections on @xmath149c and @xmath10ca @xcite , whose qep position displays a pattern , as a function of @xmath39 , quite different from the ( p , n ) case , in agreement with our calculations for @xmath10ca @xcite , but not for @xmath149c . in this connection , we remind the reader that in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath3he projectile has been treated as structureless , whereas , as already mentioned , a proper account of its internal structure might affect the shape of the response functions @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , at the moment , whether this shell dependence of the glauber quasi - elastic responses is a genuine effect or , rather , it reflects a shortcoming of the model or the approximations of our treatment : indeed , in the two - step contribution we have neglected the cylindrical geometry of the reaction , which , as we noted , is the source of the shift in the one - step term .",
    "actually , the discrepancy between @xmath149c and @xmath10ca shows up at large momenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , where the two - step response is relatively more important .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the same comparison as in fig .  [ fig8 ] , but for ( p , p@xmath2 ) scattering at 795 mev @xcite .",
    "we have considered only the dominant scalar - isoscalar channel , which means that in ( [ eq : csa ] ) and ( [ eq : csb ] ) we have set @xmath193 . by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] a few observations follow : the two - step contribution is smaller than in the ( p , n ) case , as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : twostep ] ; the simple calculation based on ( [ eq : r1lt ] ) of course yields a better account of the qep position , since ( p , p@xmath2 ) data do not show any shift ; on the other hand , the @xmath39-dependence of the height of the peak is unsatisfactorily described , but this is due to our choice of only allowing the scalar - isoscalar channel : when the momentum transfer increases ( say , over 1.5 @xmath158 ) other components of the nn amplitudes become important and should help in increasing the height of the response .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to investigate the quasi - elastic nuclear response as seen in electron and , especially , proton inclusive scattering .",
    "we restricted ourselves to unpolarized scattering , since already in this domain a number of issues wait to be clarified .",
    "our attention has been mainly directed to the ( p , n ) and ( p , p@xmath2 ) reactions , owing to the surprising and apparently contradictory figures displayed by these experiments .",
    "we have first applied our formalism , based on continuum rpa plus spreading width of the ph states , to the transverse electron scattering finding that :    * rpa correlations shift the qep position to higher energy ; * the @xmath39-dependence of the strength in the qep domain is not correctly reproduced by our model , since some strength is actually missing at low but not at high momenta ; * in the high energy tail of the response strength is missing at all momenta .",
    "the solution of the problem in items ii ) and iii ) likely comes from the contribution from 2p-2h processes and meson - exchange currents , as can be seen from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , worked out in nuclear matter .",
    "neglecting 2p-2h contributions in hadron scattering should be a less serious shortcoming , because of the strong density dependence , which makes them relatively less important in the low density surface regions probed by strongly interacting projectiles .    in hadron scattering , on the other hand , multiple - scattering contributions can be substantial and , accordingly , we have adopted the framework of glauber theory : one - step processes have been calculated consistently within the theory , whereas for two - step processes we have resorted to the approximation of accounting for the effect of distortion through a multiplicative factor . from the analysis of the hadron responses we have established the following :    * rpa correlations are strongly damped , but not completely washed out : this is at variance with the polarized ( @xmath194,@xmath195 ) experiment in los alamos at @xmath196 @xmath158 @xcite , which seems to be compatible with free responses .",
    "it remains to be understood which mechanism is responsible of the complete suppression of the rpa correlations experimentally found ; * in contrast to ( e , e@xmath2 ) scattering , the @xmath39-dependence of the strength is well reproduced ( of course , properly accounting for the non - scalar - isoscalar channels in the ( p , p@xmath2 ) reaction at high momenta ) , confirming the validity of the assumption that 2p-2h contributions should be negligible for hadronic reactions ; * the height of the qep depends on the value of @xmath190 , which is not well assessed : note that if one uses the free value , 40 mb , the height of the ( p , p@xmath2 ) cross - section is well reproduced , whereas the height of the ( p , n ) one is underestimated ; * again in contrast to ( e , e@xmath2 ) scattering , the qep comes out in the wrong position : the calculations in @xmath149c predict a hardening of the cross - section in the whole range of momenta explored ( @xmath197 @xmath158 ) , as it happens in the ( p , n ) but not in the ( p , p@xmath2 ) reaction . items iii ) and iv ) together apparently point to the need for contributions that appear only in ( p , n ) and not in ( p , p@xmath2 ) scattering ; * the shift of the peak in the calculated responses is a consequence of the distortion of the proton wave and it is _ not _ the same in @xmath149c and @xmath10ca , whereas the available data appear to scale . since the glauber theory is equivalent to the distorted wave born approximation in the eikonal limit ( which might or might not be valid at the incident energy of 800 mev ) , it would be interesting to see if also in the dwba framework a shell dependence shows up .",
    "note also that the two - step response is not treated in a way fully consistent with the glauber theory , a fact that could have some influence on the shape of the response functions ; * at high transferred momenta the two - step term is sizable in the ( p , n ) reaction and , because of the momentum dependence of the nn amplitudes , does not give a smoothly increasing background , as it does at small momenta , but rather a contribution peaked slightly below the qep .",
    "no final statement can be made , at the moment , on these issues : however , we wish to stress the necessity of formulating a theory of the nuclear response able to cope simultaneously with all the different kinds of reactions .",
    "accurate calculations are surely needed , but only from a careful cross - referencing of the many phenomena unveiled in the scattering on complex nuclei can one hope to obtain a guide towards a solution of the difficult many - body nuclear problem .",
    "the transverse polarization propagator is defined as the trace of the current - current propagator , namely @xmath198 where @xmath199 is obtained by substituting @xmath200@xmath201 and @xmath200@xmath202 for the two vertex operators in eq .",
