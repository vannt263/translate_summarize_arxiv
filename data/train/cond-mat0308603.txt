    "the modeling of granular materials has been a subject of ongoing research in the engineering community ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in recent years , this subject has found renewed interest among physicists  @xcite ( having been studied in the distant past by great physicists such as coulomb , faraday , reynolds and others ) .",
    "the behavior of `` granular gases '' , which are obtained by e.g. , sufficiently strong shaking or shearing ( so that the material behavior is dominated by interparticle collisions ) , has been quite successfully modeled using approaches based on extensions of the kinetic theory of gases @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of dense granular matter , which is dominated by prolonged interparticle contact , has proven more difficult for modeling . for the description of the quasi - static behavior ,",
    "elasto - plastic models are commonly used by engineers  @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the static behavior of granular systems . in elasto - plastic models ,",
    "one often uses ( linear ) elasticity below yield ( although parts of a static system are sometime assumed to be at incipient yield  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in recent years a very different class of models has been proposed for describing the statics of granular materials , based on the notion of `` force propagation '' , suggested by the observation of force chains in experiments on granular materials  @xcite , as well as simulations  @xcite .",
    "these models ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) typically yield hyperbolic partial differential equations for the stress field , in contrast with the elliptic , non - propagating nature of the classical equations of static elasticity .",
    "it has been claimed that the hyperbolic description tends to an elastic - like one at large scales  @xcite ( however , the physical interpretation of the macroscopic fields in this case is not clear ) .",
    "recently , the response of granular slabs resting on a horizontal floor to a ` point force ' applied at the center of the top of the system has been studied experimentally  . in  @xcite ,",
    "the intergrain force distribution has been measured in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems as a function of vertical and horizontal distance from the point of application of the force . in  @xcite ,",
    "the particle displacements for similar 2d systems have been measured . in  @xcite ,",
    "the vertical force acting on the floor has been measured in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems .",
    "prominent force chains have been observed in ordered 2d systems ; these force chains fade out with increasing disorder . for pentagonal particles in 2d arrangements",
    "the measured force distribution is single peaked and the width of the peak is linearly related to the vertical distance , in conformity with elasticity .",
    "the results for cuboidal particles obtained in  @xcite appear to suggest a parabolic behavior , consistent with a diffusive model , although the systems studied were quite small .",
    "in  @xcite , the width of the measured distribution of displacements , as a function of the vertical distance from the particle which is directly displaced , follows a square root dependence ( as expected from a diffusive model ) for small distances of a few particle diameters , crossing over to a linear dependence at larger distances ( consistent with an elastic description ) .",
    "ordered 3d packings exhibit multiple force peaks for shallow systems  @xcite and less structure for deeper ones .",
    "somewhat larger ( in terms of number of particles ) , disordered 3d systems  @xcite exhibit a single peak in the force distribution measured at the floor , whose width is proportional to the depth of the system .",
    "the experimental evidence appears to be contradictory : different experiments seem to support fundamentally different descriptions of the response of granular materials ( in the case of 2d systems , it has been suggested that there may be a crossover from a hyperbolic to an elliptic behavior with increasing disorder  @xcite ) .",
    "the thesis presented in this paper is that these seemingly contradictory experimental results ( and theoretical explanations ) are not necessarily at odds with each other .",
    "this thesis is based on the observation that most of the studies ( perhaps all ) rejecting the elliptic description have been devoted to small systems , of the size of a few dozen of particle diameters at most , whereas many engineering studies consider rather large granular systems . since elasticity and other _",
    "macroscopic _ descriptions are not valid on small scales , at which local anisotropies and randomness play a major role , one should not be surprised that such descriptions fail on small scales . indeed , simulations  @xcite reveal the existence of a crossover from microscopic to macroscopic behavior of granular assemblies ( as well as other systems  @xcite ) as a function of system size or resolution .",
    "we argue that such a crossover is observed in some of the experiments mentioned above .",
    "strictly isostatic systems  @xcite have been shown to be described by hyperbolic stress equations  @xcite , and numerical simulations suggest that systems of frictionless spherical particles approach isostaticity in the limit of infinite rigidity  @xcite ) . however , we argue that since real granular systems have finite rigidity and usually experience frictional interactions , they can not be generically isostatic ( the same presumably holds even for frictionless non - spherical grains ) .",
    "the isostatic limit is a singular case , whose physical consequences for _ real _ systems are at best unclear .",
    "therefore the controversy surrounding the correct description of granular statics is mostly a question concerning the behavior of small granular systems .",
    "the latter require a grain - scale ( `` microscopic '' ) description , rather than a macroscopic one .",
    "a second point stressed below is the distinction between _ force _ and _ stress_. whereas interparticle forces can exhibit force chains which look like they contradict elasticity , the latter does not describe the nature of the forces but rather that of the stress field .",
    "the stress field involves an averaging over the forces ( whose result is resolution dependent ) and leads to less pronounced structure than the underlying force field . the small scale structure of the interparticle forces can not be taken to consist an argument against an elliptic description or in favor of it , since it relates to small scales and it does not deal with the objects with which elasticity or plasticity are concerned . the large scale response of granular packing is shown to be consistent with a ( possibly anisotropic ) elastic description . the fact that in non - cohesive granular materials there is no significant attraction among the particles may lead to modifications of the contact network , which may strongly affect the anisotropy of the system .",
    "this effect is expected to be small for small applied forces ( for non - isostatic systems ) and for pre - stressed systems , in particular for disordered systems .",
    "otherwise , it may be accounted for using a nonlinear , incrementally elastic model , with stress - history dependent elastic moduli .",
    "the third point made in this paper is that while models employing frictionless particles can reproduce some properties of granular packings , friction can be of utmost importance for the description of granular matter ( a rather intuitive fact ) .",
    "results demonstrating the importance of accounting for frictional interactions are presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : friction ] .",
    "in attempting to describe granular materials in terms of continuum mechanics , by analogy to `` regular '' , atomic materials , one usually considers the `` microscopic '' scale to be that of the individual particles ( whose internal dynamics should be well described by continuum mechanics ) .",
    "one of the simplest granular systems is a collection of frictionless spherical particles . a typical microscopic ( particle scale ) description of such a system is given by the particle s radii , @xmath0 , their masses , @xmath1 , center of mass positions , @xmath2 , and velocities , @xmath3 , at time @xmath4 .",
    "it is typically assumed ( e.g. , in the context of simulations of granular materials  @xcite ) that the particles are quite rigid , so that the interaction between two particles ( in the frictionless case ) depends only on their respective distance , or , more conveniently , on their imaginary overlap @xmath5 , where .",
    "the contact interactions are usually modeled by treating the particles as macroscopic objects , described by the equations of continuum mechanics ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for two frictionless elastic spheres , a classical result by hertz ( see e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    "is that the force is proportional to @xmath6 , while for cylinders , it is linear in the overlap . for noncohesive particles , only repulsive forces are possible .",
    "even for frictionless particles , internal dissipation as in e.g. , viscoelastic particles , gives rise to a dependence of the force on the relative velocity @xmath7 as well ( for some examples of force schemes commonly used in simulations , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the interparticle forces for a given configuration of such particles subject to given boundary conditions ( e.g. , specified displacements of the particles on the boundary , or forces applied to them ) and body forces such as gravity can be determined , for a static system , using the equations of equilibrium ( newton s laws ) and the force - displacement relation .",
    "we reiterate that when full force laws for particle interactions are known or modeled , the statics and dynamics of the system are fully determined ( they may be history - dependent for history - dependent force laws , as commonly used for frictional interactions ) .    in the case of frictionless isostatic systems ( in which the mean coordination number is _ exactly _ @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dimension of the system ) the forces can be determined from the equations of equilibrium alone ( and are therefore independent of the force - displacement law ; however , the particle _ displacements _ certainly depend on this law ) .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that frictionless granular systems become isostatic in the limit of infinite rigidity ( giving rise to a macroscopic behavior which is very different from elasticity ) , and this appears to be borne out by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , the relevance of this limit to real materials is questionable , since real materials can not be infinitely rigid .",
    "any additional contacts created if the rigidity is allowed to be finite will render the system hyperstatic ( so that there is a `` phase transition '' to an isostatic behavior _ only _ at infinite rigidity  @xcite ) .",
    "the rigidity should of course be compared to the confining forces or body forces ( in a system under gravity and confined by walls , the confining force is related to gravity ) .",
    "if the confining forces are very small , the system would indeed be expected to be close to marginal stability . as mentioned above",
    ", the static indeterminacy associated with hyperstatic systems simply means that the equations of equilibrium are insufficient for determining the forces , so that additional equations ( e.g. , force - displacement laws ) are required .",
    "static indeterminacy _ does not _",
    "mean that there s no unique solution for the forces in a _ real _ system .",
    "a similar situation occurs on the macroscopic , continuum level ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the rigid limit can be approached in many different ways ( e.g. , the stiffness of each interparticle contact may be different ) , and , even if assuming that the same ( isostatic ) contact network is obtained for different distribution of the interparticle stiffness , yielding the same interparticle forces , the particle displacements will certainly be different , hence the rigid limit in not unique , at least in this sense .    in several experiments ,",
    "photoelastic particles were used in order to measure the stress in granular systems  @xcite .",
    "these measurements probe the _ intraparticle _ stress , i.e. , the stress _ inside _ each particle . following the above ,",
    "these should be interpreted as measurements of microscopic fields ( the macroscopic description of granular systems regards the particles as microscopic , and does not resolve any details below the particle scale ) .",
    "the microscopic fields corresponding to these measurements are the interparticle forces , which can be deduced from these internal stress measurements ( as described in  @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned , these forces should be distinguished from the `` macroscopic '' stress field in the system .",
    "the distribution of force magnitudes in a static granular packings is a microscopic quantity which has been extensively studied in experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite .",
    "an exponential behavior of the distribution at large forces appears to be quite universal in experiments on granular systems , independent of the degree of disorder  @xcite , the friction coefficient  @xcite , or the rigidity of the particles  @xcite , and has also been observed in simulations of granular systems with different models for the interparticle forces ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the universality of the force distribution appears to extend to other systems such as foams , glasses , colloids etc .",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the exponential tail of the distribution is reproduced in simple models such as the ( parabolic ) q - model  @xcite .",
    "the distribution for smaller forces appears to be less universal , and it has been suggested that the appearance of a peak in the force distribution near the mean force may signal the onset of jamming or a glass transition  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a qualitatively similar force distribution is obtained in purely harmonic networks : fig .",
    "[ fig : forcedist ] shows the force distribution obtained for an ensemble of random networks of linear springs constructed as follows .",
    "points are placed on a 2d triangular lattice with spacing @xmath9 ( with square - shaped boundaries ) , and then their @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates are randomly displaced by @xmath12 .",
    "points whose distance is less than @xmath13 are connected by linear springs ( whose equilibrium length is equal to this distance ) with equal spring constants ( this results in an average dilution of about @xmath14 of the springs compared to the perfect lattice ) . a uniform isotropic compression of @xmath15 is applied to the boundary particles , and the interparticle forces are calculated . the force distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcedist ] is obtained from an average over the force histograms of @xmath16 systems of @xmath17 particles .",
    "the force was normalized by the mean force in the ensemble ( a similar distribution is obtained for a normalization by the mean force for each system ; the variation in mean force among different systems is relatively small , which may indicate that the system is far from ` jamming '  @xcite ) .",
    "the tail of the logarithm of the distribution is fit quite well with a line of slope @xmath18 , similar to the slope obtained in experiments on highly compressed disordered packings of soft rubber spheres  @xcite ( similar distributions were obtained for a scalar harmonic network of unequal springs in  @xcite ) . for the case of networks with no force dilution ( the same connectivity as in the perfect lattice ) , the force distribution is gaussian with a half - width of a few percent of the mean , i.e. , a much narrower distribution ) .",
    "these results indicate that a random connectivity should be consequential for the force distribution , which may be the reason that even for highly compressed disordered spheres ( whose contact network is still disordered ) , the distribution is qualitatively similar to that observed in less compressed systems  @xcite . a similar effect has been observed in simulations of granular systems under different applied pressures  @xcite .    ]",
    "the forces in one of the realizations of the ensemble are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcechains_diluted ] . force chains are clearly observed ( note that there are very few tensional forces , so that they do not significantly affect the force distribution in this case ) .",
    "similar force chains have been observed in a polydisperse lenard - jones system  @xcite ( incidentally , the concept of a force chain is not well - defined : in the case of a homogeneous strain applied to a uniform lattice , the forces are equal , so that it is reasonable to define the force chains to contain forces whose magnitude is larger than a uniform cutoff , e.g. , the mean force , as used in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcechains_diluted ] ; however , for a non - uniformly strained system , e.g. , systems subject to gravity , in which the mean force increases with depth , such a global cutoff makes little sense ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : forcechains_diluted ] indicate that force chains are not specific to granular systems .",
    "force chains are _ microscopic _ features of microscopically disordered systems ( or even inhomogeneously strained ordered systems , as described below ) , and their presence does not necessarily indicate any macroscopic inhomogeneity , or inconsistency with a macroscopic elliptic , or elastic , description . it is quite certain that if one could observe the individual interparticle forces in atomic systems ( which may not be quite well defined , since a quantum description is appropriate for such systems ) , one would also observe force chains .    ]",
    "it is important to note that a significant portion of the stress ( even in a homogeneously strained system ) is carried by forces which do not belong to the force chains .",
    "an example is provided by a system of frictionless polydisperse disks ( with radii uniformly distributed within @xmath19 of the maximum radius ) which is confined by side walls and a floor , with a uniform force applied to the particles of the `` top '' layer ( without gravity ) .",
    "the interparticle forces are taken to be linear in the overlaps .",
    "[ fig : forces_all_gtmean ] shows the forces in the system .",
    "[ fig : forcechainspercent ] shows the fraction of the applied vertical force carried by the forces whose magnitude is greater than the mean ( i.e. , those belonging to force chains , using the definition mentioned above ) , compared to that carried by all the forces ( which is of course equal to @xmath20 ) , for forces in horizontal `` slices '' of the system , as a function of the vertical coordinate , @xmath21 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcechainspercent ] , only about @xmath22 of the applied force is carried by the force chains .",
    "furthermore , the force carried by the chains fluctuates with depth , so that the forces in the chains do not obey the conditions of force equilibrium .",
    "it is therefore questionable whether a model which describes the stress exclusively in terms of the force chains is justifiable .",
    "the ( near-)universality of the force distribution , in particular the fact that it is observed in simulations of random systems with harmonic interactions , does not make possible the differentiation between different models on the basis of the force distribution ( in particular , the observation of such a distribution does not preclude an elliptic description ) .",
    "the same statement applies to the observation of force chains .",
    "a more sensitive and direct test should be rendered by the response of a granular system to inhomogeneous external forcing , such as that provided by localized forces .",
    "the latter seem to be consistent with elasticity , as described below .",
    "continuum descriptions of materials are often based on phenomenological arguments ( usually motivated by experimental findings ) , rather than on derivations from the underlying microscopic dynamics .",
    "a unique feature of granular materials is that due to the typically large sizes of the constituents , it is relatively easy to access the `` microscopic '' scales experimentally . on the other hand , in most practical applications ,",
    "the number of particles is such that a detailed particle - level description becomes intractable , and a continuum description is required .",
    "the fact that experiments on granular systems can yield both microscopic information and macroscopic information ( possibly even in the same experiment ) is useful to the elucidation of the connection between these two descriptions .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to elucidate the role of frictional forces and torques in the quasi - static response of granular materials in general , and in particular in order to gain an understanding of the experimental results mentioned above  @xcite , we performed discrete element simulations with normal and tangential linear spring - dashpot forces among the particles ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) , possibly the simplest model for frictional disks .",
    "the simulation parameters were chosen to correspond to those of the experimental system  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the force - displacement law for the photoelastic disks was found to be fit quite well by @xmath23  @xcite , as predicted by the standard hertz theory for elastic ellipsoids in contact ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , rather than the linear relation ( with logarithmic correction ) expected for cylinders in contact  @xcite , which appears to imply that the contact region between the `` disks '' is elliptic rather than rectangular .",
    "the simulation model described above employs a linear force - displacement law , so that an effective mean spring constant was estimated on the basis of the range of forces used in the experiments .",
    "the tangential spring constant was taken to be one - half the normal spring constant ( a rough estimate consistent with the hertz - mindlin model  @xcite for oblique contact forces ) .",
    "the normal and tangential spring constants used are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mean particle radius and mass , respectively , and @xmath28 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the friction coefficient used is @xmath29 for particle - particle contacts and @xmath30 for particle - wall contacts .",
    "the systems studied here are composed of polydisperse disks , with radii distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 ( i.e. , a small polydispersity ) .",
    "the system is first relaxed to a static state under gravity ( until the total kinetic energy per particle is less than @xmath33 ) , and then relaxed again with an external force applied at the center of the top layer ( in some cases the force was increased linearly with time from zero to prevent the `` buckling '' of the top layer which leads to major rearrangements ; these are beyond the nearly elastic behavior considered here ) .    for comparison with the experiments presented in  @xcite , an external force of magnitude @xmath34",
    "was applied to the center top particle at angles of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the simulated systems consisted of @xmath37 rows of @xmath38 particles , which is similar to the size of the systems used in the experiments  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : forces_all_angles ] presents the forces obtained for different applied force angles .",
    "the same particle configuration was used in all cases .",
    "no significant particle rotation occurred except for the particles adjacent to the one on which the force is applied . for a force at an angle of @xmath39 , buckling occurred in the top row , causing major rearrangements .",
    "such buckling was also observed in the experiments , where it was apparently stabilized , limiting the rearrangements to a small region near the point of application of the force , but we have not been able to prevent major rearrangements in the simulation . as mentioned , tangential forces such as friction give rise to interparticle torques .",
    "simulations with an applied torque ( in addition to the applied force ) show that this torque does influence the observed force chains  @xcite .",
    "the results are quite similar , qualitatively , to those observed in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "note that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forces_all_angles ] are for a single configuration , while the results presented in  @xcite are for an average over configurations .",
    "the results obtained in simulations for different realizations of the disorder are qualitatively similar  @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the results obtained using a relatively simple force model with the experiments is encouraging .",
    "a more detailed study of the effects of friction on the forces and the stress field will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the seemingly inconsistent results of different kinds of experiments studying the static response of granular packings to a concentrated force can all be understood within the same framework of an essentially elastic ( elliptic ) picture once the distinction between forces and stress is made and the possible consequences of small system size , as well as anisotropy , are taken into account .",
    "the effect of applied stresses on the contact network may be modeled as a nonlinear , incrementally elastic model ( which may be further extended to describe yielding ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , many aspects of the response of such systems can be understood using models of frictionless particles .",
    "however , some effects do require the introduction of friction , as in the example of the force chains obtained for oblique applied forces described in this paper .",
    "we note , however , that the model for the friction used in the simulations described in sec .",
    "[ sec : friction ] consists of tangential springs ( with the additional coulomb condition ) .",
    "this indicates that even for static frictional systems ( below yield ) an elastic continuum model , which probably includes rotational degrees of freedom ( e.g. , a cosserat continuum model  @xcite ) , may be appropriate .",
