    "antiferromagnetic three - state potts model has interesting properties .",
    "it is described by the following hamiltonian : h = j_<ij>(s_i , s_j ) [ nn ] where @xmath0 indicates summation over nearest neighbor pairs , and @xmath1 denotes three - state potts spin on the @xmath2th site . in antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath3 ) , the neighboring two spins prefer to take different values",
    ". typical ground state configuration of the model on the square lattice is depicted in fig.(1 ) .",
    "one can change the state of certain spin in fig.(1 ) from `` 2 '' to `` 3 '' , or vice versa , without any energy cost .",
    "one half of all the spins are such `` semi - free '' spins , therefore ground state is infinitely degenerated .",
    "it should be noted that if we divide the lattice in fig.(1 ) into two interpenetrating sublattices , there are only `` 1 '' spins on one sublattice , while random mixture of `` 2 '' spins and `` 3 '' spins is present on another sublattice .    for the model on simple cubic lattice",
    ", it is known that long - range order is realized at finite temperature @xcite in spite of the high degeneracy of ground - state which usually leads to the disordered state at all temperature range @xcite .",
    "recently this model ( on the simple cubic lattice ) has been studied intensively concerning two interests ; one on the nature of the order - disorder transition and another on the nature of ordered phase .",
    "order - disorder transition is continuous and the associated critical exponents are estimated by various methods , such as monte carlo simulation @xcite and the coherent - anomaly method @xcite .    as for the nature of ordered phase",
    ", it is known that so - called broken - sublattice - symmetry ( bss ) phase is realized at a sufficiently low temperature @xcite , in which one of the sublattices is dominated by one spin state , while the second sublattice is dominated by the mixture of the remaining two spin states .",
    "recently several different claims have been made about the nature of the ordered phase at the region just below the transition temperature .",
    "lapinskas and rosengren concluded that so - called permutationally - symmetric - sublattice ( pss ) phase , in which each two sublattices are dominated by one spin state , is realized at a very narrow temperature range just below the transition point , based on cluster - variation method analysis @xcite and monte carlo simulation @xcite . on the other hand , kolesik and suzuki",
    "have performed monte carlo simulations and observed a rotationally symmetric phase at a certain range near the transition point , finding no evidence of the pss phase @xcite .",
    "now we consider the effect of next - nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian : h = j _",
    "< i , j>_nn ( s_i , s_j)- j _",
    "< i , j>_nnn ( s_i , s_j ) [ hamil ] where the first and the second summation runs over all nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor pairs on the simple cubic lattice , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice consists of two sublattices , which we refer as a and b. the first term in ( [ hamil ] ) represents the inter - sublattice antiferromagnetic interaction and the second one represents the intra - sublattice ferromagnetic interaction , which resolves the high degeneracy of ground state .",
    "thus the n.n.n .",
    "interaction affects the nature of the ordered phase because the bss phase costs energy proportional to @xmath5 compared to the pss phase .",
    "this effect for the models on the square lattice has been studied by several methods @xcite .    in three dimensions ,",
    "we expect another effect produced by a strong n.n.n .",
    "interaction ; one can consider @xmath6 limit as two independent systems of the ferromagnetic @xmath7 potts model , which undergoes the first - order phase transition in three dimensions @xcite . thus the order - disorder transition is expected to become discontinuous as @xmath8 becomes large .",
    "mean - field theory gives qualitatively correct answer for both @xmath9(af ) and @xmath6 ( f ) cases in three or greater dimensions , namely the bss phase is realized below the continuous phase transition point in the af case , and discontinuous phase transition occurs in the f case .",
    "we investigate the intermediate region using mean - field theory in the following sections .",
    "to perform a mean - field calculation , we use a method of variational free energy which is equivalent to equation of self - consistency @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following mean - field hamiltonian : h_0=_i _",
    "s=1 ^ 3 h_is(s_i , s ) [ h0 ] where @xmath10 is a mean - field acting on the @xmath2th spin .",
    "boltzmann probability factor for the system described by @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 , which is a product of probability factors of individual spins : p_0(\\{s_i})=_i p_i(s_i ) [ p0 ] p_i(s)=(-h_is ) ( -h_i1)+ ( -h_i2)+ ( -h_i3 ) [ pi ] we minimize the following variational free energy ( divided by the total number of spins @xmath13 ) with respect to @xmath10 : f_0=(<h>_0-t s_0)/n [ f-0 ] the symbols @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes respectively the expectation value and the entropy associated with the probability distribution @xmath12 : @xmath16 minimization problem with respect to @xmath10 is equivalent to that with respect to @xmath17 under following constraints : p_i(1)+p_i(2)+p_i(3)=1 , p_i(s)0 translational symmetry assures that the free energy ( [ f-0 ] ) is minimized when : @xmath18 obviously , @xmath19 coincides with the expectation value of the concentration of @xmath20th spin state on the sublattice @xmath21 , calculated with the probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "they are under following constraints : c_1+c_2+c_3=1 , c_s0 [ constr ] then @xmath23 and @xmath15 are expressed with @xmath19 : _ 0= z_1 j n 2_s c_sac_sb -z_2 j n2_s ( c_sa^2+c_sb^2)/2 s_0 = -n_s ( c_sac_sa+c_sbc_sb)/2 where @xmath24 denotes the coordination number of n.n . and n.n.n .",
    "sites respectively ( for the simple cubic lattice , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "furthermore , we define two - component sublattice magnetization similar as ono used @xcite : @xmath27 then the three quantities @xmath28,@xmath29 , and @xmath30 can be expressed by two quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 owing to the constraint @xmath33 . @xmath34",
    "the two - component sublattice magnetization @xmath35 carry an irreducible , unitary representation of the permutation group of the three spin states @xmath36 . owing to the constraints @xmath37 ,",
    "the sublattice magnetization @xmath35 is restricted to take a value within a regular triangle on the @xmath38 plane ( fig.2 ) .",
    "three vertexes of the triangle correspond to completely ordered state ( @xmath39,@xmath40,@xmath41 etc . ) and the point @xmath42 corresponds to completely disordered state ( @xmath43 ) .    we have minimized the free energy @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45,@xmath46,@xmath47 , and @xmath48 numerically using the following iteration : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a small , positive quantity .",
    "the iteration ( [ num ] ) is repeated until @xmath44 converge to some minima .",
    "several values were used as an initial value @xmath51 and @xmath52 to find absolute minimum value of @xmath44 out of all minima .",
    "finally we obtained a phase diagram of two parameters @xmath53 and @xmath8 ( fig.(3 ) ) .",
    "the order - disorder transition is continuous for @xmath54 and discontinuous for @xmath55 .",
    "there are two kind of ordered phases , bss phase and pss phase , separated by a discontinuous transition line .",
    "typical values of the concentrations of the three states and the sublattice magnetizations of each ordered phases are shown in fig.(4 ) . in the pss phase ,",
    "the angle between each sublattice magnetizations is non - trivial value ; it is greater than @xmath56 and less than @xmath57 .",
    "the non - trivial value of the angle can be understood as follows .",
    "the antiferromagnetic n.n .",
    "interaction makes two points @xmath58 and @xmath59 `` repulsive '' , therefore prefers @xmath57 . on the other hand , the energy of the ferromagnetic n.n.n .",
    "interaction is minimized when @xmath35 locates on the vertex of the triangle , therefore prefers @xmath56 .",
    "thus we can understand the non - trivial value of the angle as a result of the competition of the two interactions .",
    "banavar and wu have studied the same model as ( [ hamil ] ) with @xmath60 using the mean - field theory @xcite and concluded that the pss phase does not appear .",
    "our result disagree with theirs .",
    "since the numerical method ( [ num ] ) becomes less precise near the critical line , we expand the mean - field free energy @xmath44 in powers of the order - parameter to investigate the critical behavior .",
    "firstly we define ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order - parameters : @xmath61 relevant quantities to the order - disorder transition are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which carry an irreducible representation of a group @xmath64 ( permutation of three spin states ) @xmath65 ( permutation of two sublattices ) , isomorphic to the group @xmath66 ( point group of a regular hexagon ) .",
    "indeed , the allowed range of the antiferromagnetic order - parameter @xmath67 is a regular hexagon in the @xmath68 plane .",
    "then we introduce polar coordinates of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order - parameter : @xmath69 the pss phase and the bss phase can be distinguished by the direction of the antiferromagnetic order - parameter @xmath70 ; the value of @xmath70 expected in the pss and the bss phase is @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , respectively .",
    "thus a quantity @xmath74 is a relevant quantity to the pss - bss phase transition @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is @xmath75 in the bss phase , while @xmath76 in the pss phase .",
    "now we use @xmath77,@xmath70,@xmath78 , and @xmath79 as independent variables of the free energy @xmath44 and trace out @xmath78 and @xmath79 in order to obtain an effective free energy form which is expressed by @xmath77 and @xmath70 only .",
    "f_af(r_af,_af)_r_f,_ff_0(r_af,_af , r_f,_f ) = f_0(r_af,_af , , ) [ faf ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 gives minimum value of @xmath44 for fixed @xmath77 and @xmath70",
    ". location of minima @xmath80 and @xmath81 is determined by solving the following equations : | _ ( r_f,_f)=(,)=0 [ min1 ] | _ ( r_f,_f)=(,)=0 [ min2 ] since we can not solve ( [ min1 ] ) and ( [ min2 ] ) explicitly , we expand @xmath80 and @xmath81 in powers of @xmath77 which is small around the critical line .",
    "firstly we expand ( [ min1 ] ) and ( [ min2 ] ) in powers of both @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "lowest order terms follow :    @xmath82    equations ( [ exp11 ] ) and ( [ exp12 ] ) indicate that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , so we assume that @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be expanded as below : @xmath87 the coefficients can be determined by letting ( [ exp21 ] ) and ( [ exp22 ] ) into equations ( [ min1 ] ) and ( [ min2 ] ) , leading to the following result : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "finally the effective free energy form is obtained by letting ( [ exp21 ] ) and ( [ exp22 ] ) into ( [ faf ] ) .",
    "note that only the terms which is invariant under the transformations of @xmath66 are present in @xmath91 , and they can be written as @xmath92 .",
    "we have calculated the effective free energy @xmath91 up to sixth order term as below : f_af = a_0 + a_2 r_af^2 + a_4 r_af^4 + ( a_6 + b_6 6_af)r_af^6 + o(r_af^8 ) where @xmath93    the critical line is the region @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which corresponds to the region @xmath96 .",
    "the order - disorder transition is discontinuous for @xmath55 and @xmath97 is a tricritical point where @xmath98 and @xmath99 vanish simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the six - fold anisotropy term @xmath100 is the origin of the bss and the pss phase ; positive @xmath101 corresponds to the bss phase and negative @xmath101 to the pss phase .",
    "presence of higher order anisotropic terms such as @xmath102 allows a occurrence of minima of @xmath91 at @xmath103 , which corresponds to neither the pss nor the bss phase .",
    "however , the positions of minima remain at @xmath104 if the coefficients of such higher order anisotropic terms are sufficiently small .",
    "the following example helps understanding above issue : a positions of minima and maxima of a function @xmath105 remain at @xmath106 , as long as @xmath107 .    on the critical line @xmath108 , @xmath101",
    "is expressed as a function of @xmath8 : b_6=243(2 + 4 ) ( 1 + 30 -180 ^2 + 40 ^3)/1310720 it vanishes at @xmath109 on the critical line , where the bss - pss transition line merges into the critical line .    note that higher order term is needed to investigate off - critical regions , where the numerical method ( [ num ] ) works well .",
    "so we do not calculate higher order terms .",
    "in this paper we have shown that a mean - field theory analysis indicates the presence of a tricritical point in the three - state potts model with the antiferromagnetic n.n .",
    "interaction and the ferromagnetic n.n.n .",
    "it is believed that mean - field theory is qualitatively correct above the upper critical dimension , where spatial fluctuations of order - parameter at the critical region become negligible .",
    "since the upper critical dimension of the tricritical phenomena is three @xcite , we expect the model on the simple cubic lattice to posses a tricritical point .",
    "owing to the simpleness of the hamiltonian , this model must serve to develop numerical methods for studies of a tricritical phenomena , such as finite - size scaling in monte carlo simulations .",
    "as for the nature of the ordered phase , we have shown that the pss phase is realized at the strong n.n.n .",
    "coupling region , as a result of the competition of the two kind of interactions , while the bss phase is realized at the weak n.n.n .",
    "coupling region .",
    "however , it should be noted that mean - field type analysis like this work may not give collect information , as pointed in ref.@xcite , about the six - fold anisotropy term which becomes relatively small compared to the order - parameter fluctuation near the critical line .",
    "so further study , such as monte carlo simulations , may be needed to clarify the nature of the ordered phase just below the critical line .",
