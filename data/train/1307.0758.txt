    "for example in applications such as in magnetic data storage devices , sensors , motors , generators , transformers @xcite it desirable to have soft magnetic materials which have high large saturation and remanent magnetization and low coercivity .",
    "these properties make them suitable for electronic devices for which a quick change of magnetization with minimum energy loss per cycle is required .",
    "thus it is very important to understand the detailed and complex relationship between microstructures and magnetization .",

    "must be overcome such that the magnetic moments have enough energy to deviate from the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "the other factor that determines coercivity is the local morphology of the material .",
    "for example , grain boundaries and other defects can modify the barrier for formation of a magnetic domain @xcite .",
    "another example is a local composition variation : a secondary soft magnetic phase could affect the initiation of magnetization reversal .",
    "finally , the exchange interaction and magnetic dipole interactions also influence coercivity .",
    "these interactions establish collective alignment of magnetic moments which facilitates the formation of the magnetic domains @xcite .",
    "understanding the relation of magnetic microstructure to crystalline microstructure can be useful for designing materials with desired magnetic properties .",
    "this is particularly true of nanocrystalline materials with grain sizes on the order of a few tens of nanometers , where grain size and magnetic correlation lengths are comparable .",
    "the relative magnitude of these length scales can alter the mechanism of magnetic domain formation to be controlled either by a long - range cooperative magnetic behaviour or by a local ordering .",
    "this gives rise to a relatively broad range of coercivity values attainable in nanocrystalline magnetic materials @xcite and opens up new opportunities to develop ultra - high - density magnetic storage devices @xcite .",
    "understanding the physics of these systems , however , requires a robust modeling formalism that is capable of describing magneto - elastic interactions in the presence of crystalline defects and microstructural processes that evolve on diffusive time scales .",
    "one of the first studies of the effect of crystallographic structure on the magnetic properties was by harris _",
    "they suggested a simple hamiltonian to describe magnetism in amorphous materials with random anisotropy .",
    "later , this model was developed to study amorphous materials in which the magnetic correlation length spans many length scales with different anisotropy directions @xcite : for small grains the magnetic correlation length is larger than the grain size , the effective anisotropy is suppressed by the exchange interaction within a domain .",
    "in such materials the coercivity , @xmath0 and the grain size , @xmath1 , are related as _",

    "in contrast , when the grain size is larger than the magnetic correlation length , the magnetization is controlled by domain wall pinning at the grain boundaries and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this simple model has formed the basis of most theories on magnetic hardness in nano - crystalline magnetic materials @xcite , and its predictions were confirmed by experiments @xcite",
    ".    the relationship between grain size and hysteresis continues to be the subject of numerous investigations in the field of micromagnetism @xcite .",
    "most approaches have been based on minimization of hamiltonians that contain terms for anisotropy , exchange , magneto - elastic and demagnetizing energies @xcite .",
    "these hamiltonians tend to be rather complex and can be solved for minimum energy configurations only in simple geometries and under certain simplifications , most of which do not adequately reflect the complex microstructure of a material .",
    "magnetization has recently been coupled to phase field order parameters to describe different crystal variants or phases .",
    "magneto - phase field free energies are then used to derive dynamical equations of microstructure evolution in the presence of magnetic field in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these models is that the interface between the crystalline phases emerges naturally in the dynamics of the field equations .",
    "furthermore , in this approach the free energy is developed in terms of the coarse - grained order parameters in space and time which makes it possible to reach the diffusive time scales and the length scales necessary to study the microstructure evolution in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the main drawback of traditional phase field approaches is that they lack direct coupling to plastic and elastic effects emergent from the atomic structure of crystalline phases .",
    "information about the crystallographic structure of material typically enters through effective parameters controlling the anisotropy , exchange stiffness or the boundary conditions .",
