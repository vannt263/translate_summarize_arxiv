    "since the discovery of fractional quantum hall effect(fqhe ) and high @xmath1 cuprates , it has been realized that a large class of phases and phase transitions can not be described by landau symmetry breaking theory .",
    "enormous efforts have been made to understand the underlying physics for these new systems during the last two decays .",
    "it has been realized that the strongly correlated nature plays an essential role for these new classes of quantum matter .",
    "the most successful and powerful approach to study these new systems is based on new classes of variational wave functions .",
    "for example , the famous laughlin wave function@xcite successfully explains the quantized nature of hall conductance at rational filling .",
    "it turns out such a new state is very different from a symmetry breaking state and it can describe new orders of quantum matter  topological order@xcite . although the essential physics of high-@xmath1 is still under controversial , it is believed the relevant low energy physics is controlled by a class of metastable states  the resonating - valence - bond(rvb ) states@xcite .",
    "a quantitative description for the rvb states is based on the projective wave function approach , which was first proposed to satisfy the no - double - occupancy constraint for ( repulsive)hubbard model in the strong coupling limit@xcite .",
    "it turns out this new class of states can also describe new phases of matter with topological order or quantum order@xcite .",
    "later , those projective functions are widely used to describe the novel phenomena in strongly correlated systems , including frustrated magnets@xcite as well as the lattice fractional quantum hall states@xcite .    despite the success of projective states ,",
    "they are specially designed to describe states with particular topological order or quantum order and it is very difficult to study the competing effect between different orders .",
    "thus , it is very important to establish a unified frame work to encode different orders of quantum matter . in ref.@xcite , a natural generalization of the projective states , the grassmann tensor product states(gtps )",
    "have been proposed as generic variational wave functions to study interacting boson / fermion systems .",
    "however , only local gtps(gtps with short range bonds)can be efficiently simulated approximately@xcite . as a result , it is also very important to understand what kind of states can be faithfully represented in a local way . for spin systems , refs . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ground states of non - chiral topological phases , the so called string - net condensates@xcite , admit a local tensor product states(tps ) representation .",
    "later , the fermionic version of string - net states was proposed in ref.@xcite and it has been shown they can describe non - chiral topological orders(e.g . ,",
    "fractional topological insulators ) in fermion systems .",
    "similar as the bosonic string - net states , their ground states can also be faithfully represented as gtps since the parent hamiltonians for these new classes of phases can be described as summations of ( fermionic)commuting projectors . in a recent work",
    ", it has been shown even for systems with chiral topological orders , all the physical quantities still admit a local gtps representation@xcite despite that their ground states wave functions contain long range bonds @xcite .",
    "thus , best to our knowledge , the gtps variational approach can in principle describe all kinds of gapped local boson / fermion systems in @xmath2d .",
    "clearly , the advantage of this new variational approach is that it provides a unified description for many different orders of quantum matter and allows us to study the competing effect between these different orders .    on the other hand , from the quantum information and computation perspective",
    ", it has been shown that ground states of gapped local hamiltonians obey so - called area laws . for local boson / spin systems with translational invariant , states satisfy such a property can be efficiently represented by the class of so - called matrix product states(mps ) in one dimension and tensor product states(tps ) or projected entangled pair states ( peps ) in higher dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently , a fermionic generalization of those states  the fermionic projected entangled pair states ( fpeps ) were proposed and have been bench marked for many interesting free / interacting fermion systems@xcite . in ref.@xcite , it has been shown all fpeps can be represented as ( local)gtps .",
    "although gtps are conceptually useful , the implementations in generic strongly correlated boson / fermion systems are still not easy since the tensor contraction for generic gtps is an exponential hard problem .",
    "similar difficulties occur for peps(fpeps)@xcite and many efforts have been made based on the mps algorithm@xcite",
    ". however , the mps algorithm still has a very big cost to handle large system with periodical boundary condition(pbc)@xcite .",
    "alternatively , based on the concept of renormalization@xcite , the so - called tensor - entanglement renormalization group(gterg)@xcite method and its recent development@xcite turn out to be very successful for systems with pbc .",
    "similar as terg , based on the renormalization principle for grassmann variables , the grassmann - tensor - entanglement renormalization group(gterg ) was proposed in ref.@xcite to simulate physical measurements for gtps approximately . however , a naive minimization procedure for generic gtps variational approach will still be very hard due to the large number of variational parameters when inner dimension @xmath0 increases(scale as @xmath3 on honeycomb lattice and @xmath4 on square lattice ) . for tps",
    ", it is well known the imaginary time evolution algorithm is the best method to solve this problem .",
    "thus , it is natural to generalize this algorithm into gtps .    in this paper , we will show based on the fermion coherent state representation , all the algorithms developed for usual tps can be easily generalized into gtps .",
    "the paper is organized as following : in section ii , we represent a standard form of gtps , which only contains one specie of grassmann variable for each inner index and significantly simplifies the representation for numerical calculations . in section iii , we first give a brief review about the concept of imaginary time evolution algorithm for tps and then present the detail implementation of the imaginary time evolution algorithm for gtps .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the algorithm for a simple spinless fermion system on honeycomb lattice , including both off - critical and critical cases . in section iv",
    ", we describe the environment effect of the gterg algorithm and present a simple improved algorithm .",
    "we implement the algorithm for a critical free fermion system on honeycomb lattice and find a significant improvement .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize our results and discuss possible future developments along this direction .",
    "in this section , we will introduce a standard form to represent gtps . in the standard form ,",

    "the key step is also based on the conjecture that the rank @xmath263 tensor @xmath264 can be factorized into a product form : @xmath265 where @xmath266,@xmath267 are the double indices . for any converged @xmath268 and @xmath269 from the simplified time evolution algorithm with converged weight vectors @xmath270 , the weight vectors @xmath271 for double tensors @xmath239 can be determined as : @xmath272 the above conjecture for the environment is reasonable when the environment of @xmath273 can be approximated as a product form since @xmath274    similar as the simplified time evolution algorithm , solving the optimal cost function in this case can be implemented by the svd decomposition for matrix @xmath275 : @xmath276 then the rank @xmath158 double tensors @xmath250 and @xmath251 can be determined as : @xmath277 finally , the weight vector @xmath278 for @xmath279 can be updated as @xmath280 .    in general cases , the assumption eq.([environment ] ) could not be true , however , as long as @xmath281 has a much more uniform distribution(up to proper normalization ) : @xmath282 the above weighted terg(wterg ) algorithm can still improve the accuracy for fixed @xmath230 with the same cost .",

    "complex valued double tensors with grassmann variable valued double tensors , all the above discussions will be valid for gtps .",
    "however , the definition of the inner product @xmath241 and the corresponding 2-norm @xmath244 should also be generalized into their grassmann version , which evolves the integration over grassmann variables for the connected links with respect to the standard grasamann metric .",
