    "in this paper , we consider the construction of absorbing boundary conditions ( abcs ) for the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) , @xmath0\\psi,\\label{nls}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the atomic mass , @xmath2 represents the planck constant , and @xmath3 is the potential function .",
    "this equation appears in many different applications @xcite , such as the gravity waves on deep water in fluid dynamics , the pulse propagations in optics fibers , and the bose - einstein condensation . for the cubic nonlinear term @xmath4 , eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) reduced to gross - pitaevskii equation , which be numerically studied by @xcite and references therein . for a quintic nonlinearity",
    ", one can see @xcite .",
    "a current challenge for the numerical solutions of this kind of problems is due to the unboundedness of the physical domain .",
    "the common practice to overcome this difficulty is to limit the computational domain and solve a reduced problem . to make the truncated problems complete , boundary conditions",
    "should be added to the reduced problem .",
    "abcs applied at prescribed artificial boundaries have been widely studied in recent decades , such as @xcite for hyperbolic wave equations , @xcite for elliptic equations , @xcite for parabolic equations ; see also the reviews by givoli@xcite , tsynkov@xcite , hagstrom@xcite and han@xcite .",
    "the purpose of designing abcs is to annihilate all the incident waves so that minor reflected waves may propagate into the computational domain .",
    "abcs can be distinguished into two categories : the global abcs and local abcs .",
    "the global abcs usually lead to the well - approximated and well - posed truncated problems , but the implementation cost for the global abcs is expensive .",
    "fast evaluation methods @xcite should be applied to treat the global abcs . on the other hand ,",
    "local abcs are computationally efficient , but the accuracy and stability are the main concerns .",
    "there is another way to design abcs based on the media of the material , called the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) methods @xcite , which have been applied to many complicated wave propagation problems .    for the nonlinear equations ,",
    "however , it is difficult to find a suitable boundary condition on the artificial boundary in general , except for some special cases such as the problem can be linearized @xcite , or a burgers type questions @xcite which can be corresponded with the linear parabolic equations by the cole - hopf transformation . for the nls equation on the unbounded domain",
    ", zheng @xcite obtained the transparent boundary condition using the inverse scattering transform approach for the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation in one dimension .",
    "antonie et al .",
    "@xcite also studied the one - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation and constructed several nonlinear integro - differential artificial boundary conditions . in @xcite , szeftel designed absorbing boundary conditions for one - dimensional nonlinear wave equation by the potential and the paralinear strategies .",
    "soffer and stucchio@xcite presented a phase space filter method to obtain absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the pml @xcite was also applied to handling the nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "the recent papers @xcite , split local absorbing boundary ( slab ) conditions have been developed through a time - splitting procedure for one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "the local absorbing boundary conditions were imposed on the split linear subproblem and yielded a full scheme by coupling the discretizations for the interior equation and boundary subproblems .",
    "in addition , an adaptive method was developed to determine the parameter @xmath5 involved in the local boundary conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we present an efficient implementation of the nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions for the nls equation by making use of the splitting idea @xcite .",
    "we distinguish incoming and outgoing waves along the boundaries for the linear kinetic subproblem , and then unite the potential energy subproblem to yield nonlinear boundary conditions which are of local form and examine the coupling between the equation governing the wave in the computational domain and the boundary conditions on the boundary yields a well - posed problem .",
    "furthermore , the obtained boundary conditions are  easy \" to discretize and  cheap \" to compute in terms of the computational time .",
    "we will then perform numerical tests to illustrate the effectiveness and tractability of this approach .",
    "let us first consider the local abcs of the linear schrdinger equation , @xmath6 which will be the basis of constructing abcs of nonlinear problems , because it is the kinetic part of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) .    in the frequency domain of the fourier transform , the one way equations at the two boundaries , which annihilate all the outgoing waves ,",
    "can be represented by @xmath7 where the subscript represents the partial derivative , @xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the frequency , the plus sign in  @xmath11 \" corresponds to the right boundary condition , and the minus sign corresponds to the left . the transparent boundary conditions in exact manner of the problem",
    "is then derived by an inverse fourier transform : @xmath12 which is a nonlocal boundary condition . in order to get local boundary conditions",
    ", a usual way is to approximate the square root @xmath13 by using polynomials or rational polynomials .",
    "for instance , applying the approximations @xmath14 we obtain the first three absorbing boundary conditions in the physical domain : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is a positive constant , and @xmath17 which is called the wavenumber parameter .      in this section ,",
    "we derive the absorbing boundary conditions for the one - dimensional nls equation ( [ nls ] ) on the region @xmath18 $ ] by assuming that there do not exist outgoing waves at the two ends @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we remark that this assumption is not correct for a general wave due to the nonlinear or space - dependent potential @xcite , but it is reasonable for many situations of physical applications ; in fact , this is a fundamental assumption so that we can design absorbing boundary conditions .    to understand the philosophy of obtaining nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions , let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) into the following operator form : @xmath21\\psi(x , t ) , \\label{operform}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 represents the linear differential operator which accounts for the kinetic energy part , and @xmath23 is the nonlinear operator that governs the effects of the potential energy and nonlinearity .",
    "these are given by @xmath24 in a time interval from @xmath25 to @xmath26 for small @xmath27 , the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ operform ] ) can be approximated by @xmath28\\tau/\\hbar}\\psi(x , t ) \\approx e^{-i\\hat{t}\\tau/\\hbar}e^{-i\\hat{v}\\tau/\\hbar}\\psi(x , t ) .",
    "\\label{splitting}\\ ] ] this means in a small time step @xmath27 that the approximation carries out the wave propagation in a kinetic energy step and a potential energy step separately .",
    "this is the basic idea of the well - known time - splitting method ( or the split - step method ) which is effective to numerically solve the nonlinear schrdinger - type equations .",
    "it is natural to examine the well - posedness that we concern most of the induced initial boundary value problem confined in the finite computational interval for the nonlinear schrdiger equation by using the nonlocal absorbing boundary condition .",
    "the classical energy method seems to be difficult to obtain the stability result of the problem under consideration here . in this section",
    ", we will investigate the stability based on kreiss s normal mode analysis method@xcite and references therein , which was also used for the wave equations and the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "the idea of the general algebraic normal mode analysis is based on the fact that the well - posed problem does not admit any complex eigenvalues with positive real parts @xmath41 , or generalized eigenvalues with @xmath42 and the negative ( positive ) group velocity of normal mode on the right - hand ( left - hand ) boundary .",
    "the eigenvalues and generalized eigenvalues satisfy the dispersion relations of both the interior equation and the equation on the boundaries .",
    "if there exist such eigenvalues , the problem will admit an unboundedly grown normal mode @xmath43 and is hence unstable .",
    "if there exit such generalized eigenvalues , the boundary conditions will admit a incoming wave which will propagate energy into the interior domain to disrupt the solution in the computational interval and generate a spurious wave solution .",
    "we need to check if there exist eigenvalues and generalized eigenvalues by replacing the solution of the plane wave form @xmath44 into eq .",
    "( [ ibvp - e ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ ibvp - bl])([ibvp - br ] ) .",
    "there are left - hand and right - hand boundary , they can be considered by the same argument . here we only consider the wellposedness with the right - hand boundary conditions .",
    "for n=2 , substituting the plane wave into the dispersion relation and the boundary condition yields @xmath45 , \\label{i}\\\\ & & i\\hbar s =- i\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\hbar}{m}}k_0k- \\hbar k^2_0+[v(x)+f(|\\psi|^2)].\\label{ii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in very small time step @xmath27 the basic idea of the well - known time - splitting method is to carry out the wave propagation in a kinetic energy step and a potential energy step separately . when time step is taken limit to zero , that is the reason why we can write the nonlinear shrdinger equation in above forms , the nonlinear term is considered as a potential function .",
    "hence , let ( [ i ] ) minus ( [ ii ] ) and substitute the result into ( [ i ] ) to arrive at @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "for the @xmath48 order approximation on the right boundary , by the same argument , we have @xmath45,\\label{aa}\\\\ & & i\\hbar s=-\\frac{\\hbar^2k_0 ^ 2}{2m}\\frac{3ik+k_0}{ik+3k_0 } + [ v(x)+f(|\\psi|^2)].\\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combine ( [ aa ] ) and ( [ bb ] ) , we have @xmath49 solve ( [ k ] ) and substitute the results @xmath50 into ( [ aa ] ) to obtain @xmath51}{\\hbar}\\\\ & & s =- i\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}k_0 ^ 2-i\\frac{v_1+f_1}{\\hbar } + \\frac{v_2+f_2}{\\hbar}.\\label{order3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to have @xmath52 for @xmath53 from ( [ order2 ] ) and ( [ order3 ] ) whatever @xmath54 or @xmath55 .    in particular , when @xmath56 and @xmath57 are both real functions , i.e. @xmath58 , we thus have @xmath59 hence @xmath60 is wholly imaginary .",
    "since the boundary condition is designed to annihilate all the outgoing wave , this implies that the group velocity is positive on the right - hand boundary .",
    "hence there is no generalized eigenvalue which will propagate energy into the interior interval to influence on the true wave solution .",
    "if any instabilities which might be admitted by the generalized eigenvalues of the abcs exit , they would not propagate wave to affect the interior solution . keep this concept in mind , by linearizing the nonlinear terms in a sufficiently small time step , we can say that the boundary conditions of the problem ( [ ibvp - e])-([ibvp - br ] ) are well - posed if functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "hence the boundary condition for n=2 or 3 is well - posed and numerical tests below show that the boundary condition is stable .",
    "in this section we will test the efficiency of the nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions by using the finite - difference scheme to the induced initial boundary value problem ( [ ibvp - e])-([ibvp - br ] ) .",

    "we use the following crank - nicolson - type difference scheme @xcite @xmath67\\psi_j^{n+\\frac{1}{2}},\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{appe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to discretize the nonlinear schrdinger equation inside the computational domain , which is unconditionally stable and of second order in time . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 represents the approximation of wave function @xmath70 at the grid point @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "no equation can be defined from ( [ appe ] ) . thus the absorbing boundary conditions are required to provide two extra equations on the grid points @xmath77 for @xmath78 in the vicinity of boundary .",
