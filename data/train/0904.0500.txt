    "some cavity geometries using only single - crystal diamond and air have been proposed @xcite . however , there are difficulties in fabricating photonic devices from single - crystal diamond , since vertical optical confinement within the diamond requires either a three dimensional etching process , or a method for fabricating thin single - crystal diamond films @xcite .",
    "an alternative to fabricating devices directly from single - crystal diamond is to integrate a patterned high - index optical waveguiding layer on top of a diamond substrate , from which photons can couple evanescently to nvs close to the diamond surface .",
    "recently , a hybrid gap - diamond material system , consisting of an optically thin gap film attached to a diamond substrate , was used to demonstrate optical coupling between nvs close to the diamond surface and ridge waveguides patterned in the gap film @xcite .",

    "this leakage could be reduced by increasing the gap waveguide dimensions ( @xmath47 ) , increasing the effective index of the mode at the expense of decreasing the peak single photon field strength , and decreasing the frequency and momentum mismatch between the te-1 and higher order waveguide modes .",
    "alternatively , we can extend the gap sidewalls ( including the holes ) by depth @xmath48 into the diamond substrate . in the limit that @xmath49 , the bulk diamond lightline is no longer relevant in determining whether a gap - diamond waveguide mode is bound or leaky .",
