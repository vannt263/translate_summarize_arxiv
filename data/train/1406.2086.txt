    "* ) , respectively .",
    "in general , the class  i methanol masers are likely to be associated with interacting regions between outflows and dense ambient gases in both low- and high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the class  ii methanol masers are centrally concentrated around hot molecular cores , ultracompact(uc)h regions , oh masers and near - ir sources only in high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and possibly associated with disk - like structures and outflows around massive young stellar objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the class  i  and  ii methanol masers are complementary , and proper motion measurements of both maser lines are important to understand three - dimensional velocity structures of massive young stellar objects associated with jet / outflow / circumstellar disk systems .",
    "the class  i  and  ii methanol masers also hold a possibility of evolutionary tracers , but the relationship between them is still unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath10@xmath1@xmath11 methanol maser at 6.7ghz is one of the brightest maser species , and classified as the class  ii .",
    "the 6.7ghz methanol - maser emitting sources have been widely investigated with radio interferometers such as atca and very large array ( vla ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , the @xmath12@xmath1@xmath2 methanol maser at 44ghz is representative of the class  i methanol maser .",
    "recently , the 44ghz methanol masers have been extensively observed with single - dish radio telescopes and connected - element interferometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is a difficulty in observing the class  i methanol masers at high angular resolution .",
    "previous vlbi observations of the class  i methanol masers ( the @xmath13@xmath1@xmath14 transition at 95.2ghz : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have failed to detect any fringes for several strong class  i methanol maser sources . as the results of the vla observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the negative results of @xcite , spot sizes of the class  i methanol masers are expected to be between several milliarcseconds ( mas ) and @xmath750  mas . because of such extended structures , it has been recognized that the class  i methanol masers are easily resolved out and hence , hardly detected with current vlbi instruments with a typical angular resolution of an order of @xmath71mas .",
    "thus , there was no report for successful imaging of the class  i methanol masers with vlbi to date .",
    "recently , a new vlbi instrument , korean vlbi network ( kvn ) has been constructed , which consists of three 21 m radio telescopes @xcite . since the maximum baseline length of kvn is @xmath7500 km ( @xmath153mas at 44ghz ) , it is the most suitable for conducting vlbi observations of the 44ghz class  i methanol masers ( k.  t.  kim et al .",

    "to conduct high quality vlbi imaging , we extend the array by including four stations of vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) , which is another vlbi network in japan .    in this letter",

    "our target source is one of the brightest 44ghz methanol maser sources , .",
    "the distance of this source was estimated to be 3  kpc @xcite .",
    "this source was detected in the course of a kvn single - dish survey with a total flux density of about 500jy ( k.  t.  kim et al .",

    "a vlbi observation was carried out on 2012 april 8 , from ut17:10 to 23:53 , with kava .",
    "our target source was the 44ghz methanol maser around .",

    "* ) software correlator in kasi , daejeon @xcite . because we failed to record the data with the dir1000 recorder at one of the kvn stations , tamna , we instead employed the mark5b / difx data for the tamna baselines and combined with the dir1000/mitakafx data for the other baselines . in this letter , we only employed two 16mhz base - band signals of lhcp which are compatible with all the stations .",
    "data reduction was performed using the nrao aips package by applying a standard procedure . at first",
    ", the two datasets , correlated with difx and mitakafx , were calibrated separately as follows . the delay and the delay - rate offset",
    "were calibrated using .",
    "bandpass responses were also calibrated using .",
    "amplitude calibrations were performed by a template method using the total - power spectra of the 44ghz methanol maser in .",
    "fringe - fitting was conducted for a reference maser component in at a lsr ( local standard of rest ) velocity , @xmath25 , of 29.6kms@xmath24 .",
    "then , the datasets were combined after flagging a duplicated baseline in the data correlated with difx ( the yonsei - ulsan baseline ) . in the self - calibration of the reference maser component ,",
    "visibility based model - fittings and self - calibrations were iteratively conducted with the difmap software package provided by caltech to detect faint components from the limited @xmath6-coverage data .",
    "the self - calibration solutions were applied to the other velocity channels of the maser data .",
    "synthesis imaging and deconvolution were performed using difmap with uniform weighting . in this procedure , cut - off signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of 7@xmath114 were used to avoid possible effects of side - lobes .",
    "these cut - off values depend on dynamic ranges of each channel map .",
    "the rms noise levels in the deconvolved maps are @xmath750@xmath1200  mjy for .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes ( fwhm ) and the position angle were 2.7mas@xmath31.5mas and 64@xmath26 , respectively . for all maser channels ,",
    "maps were made with 8192pixel @xmath3 8192pixel with a pixel size of 0.1mas . because of the insufficient velocity resolution and uncertainty in the clean process with our limited @xmath6-coverage , maser structures in the images vary significantly from channel to channel ( figures[vel - map ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "however , we regarded the three maser features identified in multi - channels within the synthesized beam size as real from a comparison between the visibility data and the convolution models .",
    "for example , the map of @xmath25  =  29.8kms@xmath24 in figure[vel - map ] ( a ) shows a double - peaked structure in a north - south direction while the northern component at ( @xmath12 , 5 ) position was not detected in neighboring channels .",
    "therefore , this northern component is not considered in the following results and discussions .",
    "finally , the maser positions , fluxes , and sizes were derived by gaussian fitting to each maser component in the identified three maser features using the aips task jmfit ( table[components ] ) . to avoid influences from complicated structures of weak components , we employed image pixels with the intensity greater than the 90% of the peak intensity in the fitting .",
    "these maser components in the three maser features have s / n greater than 10 as seen in table[components ] and figures[vel - map ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "these peak intensities in the deconvolved maps correspond to 1.4@xmath18.3 times the cut - off s / n in the imaging process .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows spectra of the 44ghz methanol maser line obtained from our observation .",
    "a velocity width of the 44ghz methanol maser line is around 3kms@xmath24 .",
    "the weak red - shifted wing can be seen in the auto - correlation and cross - correlation spectra of the 44ghz methanol maser ( figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the peak flux density of the 44ghz methanol maser is 379@xmath2722jy ( @xmath28=30.0kms@xmath24 ) in the auto - correlation spectrum .",
    "however , the maximum value of the cross - correlation spectrum is 102@xmath271jy ( @xmath28=29.5kms@xmath24 ) in yonsei - ulsan baseline at ut18:46 - 18:47 corresponding to @xmath29@xmath718m@xmath5 and @xmath30@xmath719m@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , except ut17h@xmath121h of yonsei - ulsan baseline , peak flux densities of all the baselines are lower than @xmath720jy .",
    "thus , 27% of the emission can be recovered with our vlbi images and the remaining 73% is completely resolved out .",
    "this means that the 44ghz methanol maser emission is not a compact point source but is dominated by a spatially extended structure .",
    "such an extended structure of each feature is also shown in a @xmath6-distance plot ( figure  [ uv - amp ] ) .",
    "this plot shows a variation of the visibility amplitude with the @xmath6-distance for the systemic velocity of 29.8kms@xmath24 . there is a decreasing trend of the amplitude within @xmath727m@xmath5 .",
    "the data points between @xmath7100@xmath1330m@xmath5 could not be detected in the fringe - fitting process . from gaussian",
    "fitting to this plot along with the flux of auto - correlation spectrum , this trend suggests an extended maser component with a size of @xmath74mas .",
    "in addition , an increasing trend of the amplitude around 20m@xmath5 suggests an elongated maser structure .",
    "the visibility data with the @xmath6-lengths shorter than 20m@xmath5 corresponds to the yonsei - ulsan baseline data at ut17:16 - 18:48 .",
    "in contrast , visibility amplitudes with the baseline lengths longer than 30  m@xmath5 have almost constant values of @xmath715jy , suggesting a spatially compact structure .",
    "figure  [ vel - map ]  ( c ) shows a spatial and velocity distribution of the 44ghz methanol maser components .",
    "we found three maser features at different lsr velocities , denoted as 1@xmath13 .",
    "the absolute position of the maser component with @xmath25=29.4kms@xmath24 at ( 0 , 0 ) position is derived from a fringe - rate mapping using the aips task frmap to be @xmath1617@xmath1749@xmath1895 , and @xmath1912@xmath2008@xmath2106@xmath315 . thus , the 44ghz methanol maser components are separated from the mm2 core position @xcite by @xmath32@xmath70.4and @xmath33@xmath711.5 .    as mentioned in section1 , the 44ghz methanol maser toward",
    "the was detected in the course of kvn single - dish survey observations ( k.t.kim et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the single - dish observation was carried out toward the mm1 position , but the bright maser emission was found to be offset toward the southwest direction . according to the five - point cross - scan , the maser position was identified as the mm2 position with the accuracy of @xmath75 . in our vlbi observation , we adopted the coordinates obtained from the single - dish survey .",
    "however , the coordinates obtained from the fringe - rate mapping was different from the single - dish result by @xmath719 in a north - south direction , which is larger than the position error .",
    "the difference would be caused by a larger uncertainty in the fringe - rate mapping probably due to our insufficient @xmath6-coverage which made the lines in the fringe - rate map roughly lie north - south directions .",
    "even if the result of the fringe - rate mapping has the error of around 20 , the maser components detected in our observation are considered to belong to the mm2 region ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the radial velocities of these components range from @xmath34 to 31.1kms@xmath24 .",
    "they are spread over an area of @xmath760mas@xmath390mas or @xmath7180au@xmath3270au at an assumed distance of 3kpc @xcite .",
    "we can not see significant velocity structure indicative of outflow , infall , or rotational motions .",
    "the channel maps are shown in figures  [ vel - map ] ( a ) and ( b ) for the 44ghz methanol maser features .",
    "these maser structures are clearly more extended than the beam size .",
    "their detailed properties are summarized in table  [ components ] .",
    "the minimum size among the maser features is 4.98(@xmath270.32)mas@xmath32.16(@xmath270.14)mas at @xmath25 of 30.9kms@xmath24 , and the maximum brightness temperature is estimated to be @xmath35  k at @xmath25 of 29.6kms@xmath24 with an uncertainty in the absolute amplitude calibration around a few tens percent in addition to the fitting errors in table  [ components ] .",
    "we have succeeded in detecting the 44ghz methanol maser features around the iras18151@xmath11208 mm2 using newly organized kava .",
    "this is the first vlbi image of the class  i methanol maser line at 44ghz with the highest angular resolution of about 2mas .",
    "thanks to the high angular resolution , our results suggest that the 44ghz methanol masers also have compact components with the sizes of a few tens of au that are detectable by vlbi observations . with further observations of the class",
    "i methanol masers , it will be possible to provide three - dimensional velocity maps including radial velocities and proper motions as well as useful information to reveal the maser pumping mechanisms by comparing positions of multiple methanol maser lines at high spatial resolutions comparable with their spot sizes .",
    "previously , the highest resolution maps of the 44ghz methanol masers were reported by @xcite for using vla with the resolution of 50mas .",
    "they derived the linear sizes of the maser components to be 30@xmath1480au .",
    "@xcite also reported an upper limit of the maser component size of typically 50mas , and their linear sizes are less than several hundred au for five sources with vla observation with an angular resolution of @xmath7100mas .",
    "they showed the lower limit of the brightness temperature of 10@xmath36k for the strongest masers .    in our vlbi images , the minimum size among the maser features",
    "is estimated to be 2@xmath14mas , and the maximum brightness temperature is estimated to be @xmath710@xmath37k .",
    "this brightness temperature is much higher by two to four orders of magnitude than those estimated by previous lower resolution observations with vla ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is the first case determining the brightness temperature for the class  i methanol masers with a sufficiently high spatial resolution , and consistent with the previous suggestions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as seen in figure  [ spectra ] , the central velocity of the 44ghz methanol maser agrees well with the ambient molecular gas traced by the h@xmath38co@xmath39 thermal line ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "although it is proposed that the 44ghz methanol maser is excited in the shocked molecular gas , both central velocity and its velocity range are not well correlated with the outflows traced by the sio thermal line ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "it is consistent with previous interpretations for other sources that the class  i methanol maser at 95ghz traces intermediate gas around interaction regions with protostellar outflows and ambient quiescent molecular gas @xcite .    in the region ,",
    "there are four millimeter massive cores labeled mm1 to mm4 @xcite and two of them , mm1 and mm2 , are associated with maser emissions @xcite .",
    "the 6.7ghz class  ii methanol maser is detected toward mm1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the 22ghz h@xmath40o maser is detected toward both mm1 @xcite and mm2 @xcite .",
    "these water / methanol maser lines and co outflows @xcite are signposts of young stellar objects .",
    "mm2 is considered as a chemically and dynamically less - evolved massive core than mm1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mm1 is the birthplace of a massive young stellar object , possibly a pre - uch region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , around the mm1 position , radio continuum emissions are detected at @xmath411.3 cm @xcite and 3.6 cm @xcite , which are interpreted as shock - ionized flows / jets rather than uch region @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is no detection of the 6.7ghz methanol maser or radio continuum at cm - wavelength around the mm2 position .",
    "based on infrared observations , mm1 is also identified as a high - mass protostellar object with a point source of @xmath42  8@xmath43 m and @xmath44  24@xmath43 m emissions @xcite , while mm2 is an @xmath42 dark source and associated with the @xmath44  24@xmath43 m emission @xcite . @xmath45 data also show that mm1 and mm2 are associated with far - infrared point sources in 70@xmath1500@xmath43 m images , and mm1 is brighter than mm2 @xcite . from the @xmath45 data , the masses of mm1 and mm2",
    "cores are estimated to be 106@xmath46 and 81@xmath46 , respectively @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics suggest that the evolutionary stage of mm2 could be earlier than mm1 . while we can not rule out a possibility that mm2 does not host any massive young stellar objects judging from a non - detection of the 6.7ghz class  ii methanol maser , it is a potential site of massive star formation with a sufficient mass of 81@xmath46 .",
    "if this is the case , our result suggests that the 44ghz class  i methanol maser tends to appear in an earlier evolutionary phase than that traced by the 6.7ghz class  ii methanol maser in the region .",
    "it is consistently explained by one of the currently proposed scenarios of the evolutionary phase of massive star - forming regions that the class  i methanol masers appear in a younger phase than the class  ii methanol masers @xcite . however , other observational studies claimed another trend in which the class  i methanol masers may be associated with more than one evolutionary stage ( i.e. , hot core and uch ) during formation of massive young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for such a discrepancy would be insufficient spatial resolutions employed in some of the survey observations with single - dish telescopes , which could be affected by the complicated structure of massive star - forming regions as found in our target source . thus , further high - angular resolution observations of a much larger sample of methanol maser sources are required to discuss the evolutionary stage of massive young stellar objects with maser species .",
    "vlbi observations of the 44ghz methanol masers will be powerful tools to provide their accurate positions and proper motions , which are crucial to identifying the powering source of masers .",

    "<S> the central velocity and the velocity width of the 44ghz methanol maser are consistent with those of the quiescent gas rather than the outflow traced by the sio thermal line . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum component size among the maser features is @xmath75mas@xmath32mas , which corresponds to the linear size of @xmath715au@xmath36au assuming a distance of 3kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness temperatures of these features range from @xmath8 to @xmath9k , which are higher than estimated lower limit from a previous very large array observation with the highest spatial resolution of @xmath750mas . </S>",
