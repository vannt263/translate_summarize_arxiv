    "we propose an apparently new nonparametric method , `` concurrence topology '' , for describing the high - order dependence structure of multivariate binary data .",
    "it does this by translating the data into a series of shapes and then analyzing the topology of those shapes . in this paper",
    "our main focus is a specific version concurrence topology we call `` concurrence homology '' .",
    "concurrence topology can be applied to the population joint distribution .",
    "but this paper is about concurrence topology as a descriptive method applied to data .",
    "however , standard inferential statistical methods can be applied to perform inferences based on subject - wise descriptions produced by concurrence topology .",
    "that is the approach we take here ( section [ s : data.analysis ] ) .",
    "concurrence topology was initially developed for analysis of `` functional connectivity '' in resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging data ( fmri , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we use such data as a test bed for the method .",
    "this data set consists of multivariate time series of `` blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) '' values for each of 25 patients diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) , and 41 healthy controls ( section [ s : fmri.data ] ) .",
    "( concurrence topology applies to binary data so we first dichotomized the fmri bold time series values , section [ s : dichotomization ] . )",
    "others have used fmri to reveal abnormalities in functional connectivity in adhd @xcite .",
    "we find other differences using concurrence topology .",
    "a binary variable @xmath2 can be thought of as taking values in the set @xmath3 . with a nod to fmri terminology ,",
    "say that @xmath2 is `` active '' when it is `` 1 '' .",
    "informally , variables @xmath4 are `` positively associated '' if , when some of the variables are active , all @xmath1 variables tend to be active .",
    "concurrence homology is sensitive to weak or negative , i.e. , nonpositive , association .",
    "thus , variables @xmath4 are weakly or negatively associated if , compared to the number of times ( frequency ) at which _ some _ of them are active , the frequency at which they are _ all _ active is low .",
    "the frequency at which some of them are active can be checked by looking at fewer than @xmath1 variables at a time .",
    "similarly , the definition of the interaction term @xmath5 in a log linear model @xcite involves not just the product @xmath6 but also lower - dimensional marginals .",
    "if a feature of the joint distribution can be detected by looking at @xmath1 variables at a time , but not by looking only at @xmath7 variables at a time , then we say that feature has to do with the `` @xmath0-order dependence '' among the variables .",
    "for example , pearson , kendall , and spearman correlation are measures of @xmath8-order dependence because a correlation matrix for a collection of variables can be computed by looking at the variables two at a time .",
    "the odds ratio is also second - order . in this paper",
    "we focus on `` high - order '' dependence , by which we mean dependence of order at least three .    assuming",
    "_ a priori _ structure for the dependence among the variables or designating _ a priori _ some variables as `` predictors '' and others as `` responses '' can be a powerful way to learn from data . however , our interest is in `` agnostic '' methods .",
    "a method is `` agnostic '' if _ a priori _ , for @xmath9 all groups of @xmath10 variables are treated identically .",
    "this rules out much _ a priori _ structural assumptions .",
    "an example of an agnostic method is principal component analysis , a second - order method .",
    "there are apparently few nonparametric agnostic methods that can cope with the `` combinatorial explosion '' ( section [ s : combo.explosion ] ) that is inherent in describing high - order dependence among more than a few variables .",
    "other such methods include independent component analysis ( ica , @xcite ) , latent variable methods @xcite , and , perhaps , the method of @xcite .",
    "( there is a large literature on analysis of fmri data , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite . )",
    "the aforementioned methods and ours capture very different aspects of high - order dependence .",
    "hence , _ prima facie _ these methods are not competitors .",
    "for that reason , and in the interest of brevity , in this paper we do not compare concurrence topology to other methods .",
    "concurrence homology is based on ideas from algebraic topology @xcite , but can be ex- plained nontechnically via `` toy examples '' . consider the three multivariate datasets shown in table [ ta : same.to.2nd.not.to.3rd ] .",
    "each has five variables .",
    "the univariate marginal distributions are the same across all three datasets .",
    "the bivariate marginals are also the same . but the datasets differ in third - order . for example , in dataset i @xmath2 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are never all active in the same row , but in the other two datasets they sometimes are .",
    "concurrence topology is based on `` concurrences '' .",
    "a concurrence is a group of variables that are all active in the same observation . in effect , we throw away the 0 s and just retain the 1 s .",
    "( so if an observation consists entirely of 0 s , it is dropped . )",
    "call the number of variables in the concurrence the `` length '' of the concurrence .",
    ".three datasets identical up to second - order , but not at third - order .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     plotting @xmath13 vs.  @xmath14 yields a `` persistence plot '' for each dimension @xmath15 .",
    "( since we index the filtered curto - itskov complex by frequency level , our `` persistence plot '' is different from , but trivially equivalent to , the standard `` persistence diagram '' , @xcite . )",
    "figure [ f : one.subj.dmn.td.d1.pers.plot ] shows the persistence plot in dimension 1 ( third- and higher - order dependence by equation ) for the regions in the dmn for control subject `` sub01912 '' .",
    "note that the format of the plot is the same no matter what order of dependence is portrayed .",
    "( plots like this can be averaged over groups . )",
    "thus , e.g. , the dot marked by an `` * '' indicates a persistent 1-dimensional homology class that is born in frequency level 13 and dies in frequency level 3 .",
    "so as one moves downward from frequency level 13 to 3 , the frames include increasing numbers of simplices , but this hole is not filled in until frequency level 3 .",
    "one expects that classes like this one , with a long lifespan , are less likely to appear by chance and are more likely to reflect negative , rather than merely weak , association among the variables .",
    "it turns out that , indeed , the classes similar to that corresponding to the dot indicated by the `` * '' appear in most subjects in the fmri data .",
    "investigating this led us to find one of several ways of using concurrence homology to discriminate adhd subjects from controls ( section [ sss : dmn.td.d1.shrt.cycs ] ) .",
    "high - order spectral analysis of multivariate time series is a well - studied subject @xcite .",
    "there is a concurrence topology version of this . for each subject",
    "the fmri bold data consist of a multivariate time series with one component per region .",
    "concurrence topology of fmri in the `` time domain '' is carried out by constructing the filtered curto - itskov complex from direct dichotomization of bold values ( section [ s : dichotomization ] ) and treating every time point as a separate observation . in the `` fourier domain '' , instead of dichotomizing the bold signal itself ,",
    "one dichotomizes the periodograms @xcite of the component series .",
    "define concurrence in the fourier domain just as in time domain , but treating angular frequencies as separate observations .",
    "this allows the study of high - order dependence while taking into account the time series nature of fmri .",
    "the fmri data set was generated at new york university and distributed as part of the 1000 functional connectomes project ( http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/ ) . at the time we began our work",
    "this was the largest publicly available resting state fmri dataset containing clinical data available .",
    "this data set includes 41 healthy controls ( `` newyork_a_part1 '' ) and 25 adults diagnosed with adhd ( `` newyork_a_adhd '' ) .",
    "the samples were highly imbalanced with respect to age and gender .",
    "only 20% of the adhd group was female , while about half of the controls were . about 25% of the controls were children ( younger than 20 ; median age = 12 ) , while there were no children in the adhd group . among adults , ages ranged from about 21 to about 50 in each group",
    "the median age in the adhd group was 37 , while in the control group the median adult age was 27 .",
    "we computed bold values for 92 regions , including 40 in the dmn . prior to applying concurrence homology",
    "we dropped some regions in a subject - wise fashion ( section [ s : dichotomization ] ) .",
    "for each subject we computed summaries of the persistent homology of the filtered curto - itskov complex based on his / her dichotomized fmri bold data or periodograms and compared the distribution of those summaries between groups ( or , in one instance , between genders ) .",
    "thus , we performed inference between subjects , not within subjects .",
    "our purpose in this study is to develop methods for using concurrence homology in fmri data .",
    "if a method revealed something of interest in the fmri data ( usually group differences ) then we took that as an indication that the method might be a promising one for use elsewhere .",
    "thus , the analyses we undertook were exploratory . operationally , to `` reveal something of interest in the fmri data '' meant finding an effect that was significant at the @xmath16 level in an appropriate test .",
    "( we used wilcoxon rank sum and chi squared tests and generalized least squares ( gls ) , @xcite . ) `` statistical significance '' was merely a flag that indicated analytical methods that might be worthwhile for future use .    unless stated otherwise ,",
    "_ all findings we mention concerning the fmri dataset are statistically significant in this operational , uncorrected sense .",
    "_ because our analyses are only exploratory , to save space we omit many details of the analyses performed .    for each subject we computed persistent homology ( in both the time and fourier domains ) in dimensions 0 through 5 ( corresponding to dependence orders 2 through 7 ) in the dmn .",
    "we also computed persistent homology ( in time and fourier domains ) in dimensions 0 through 2 in the whole brain . in some cases",
    "we also computed the corresponding localization ( section [ s : localization ] ) and/or the `` euler characteristics '' for each subject .",
    "( the `` euler characteristic '' is a one number summary of the homology of a shape . )",
    "since the fmri dataset is quite imbalanced with respect to age and gender ( section [ s : fmri.data ] ) , we sometimes analyzed only the data in adults and/or controlled for age and/or gender .",
    "in some analyses we summarized the main features of a persistence plot by nine `` moments '' : the first `` moment '' was the number of points in the plot ( counting multiplicity ) .",
    "the other `` moments '' are , for @xmath17 ( not both 0 ) , @xmath18^{1/(i+j)}$ ] . for the dmn we computed persistent homology in dimensions 0 through 5 .",
    "hence , for the dmn we obtained for each subject @xmath19 moments . for the whole brain we computed persistent homology in dimensions 0 through 2",
    "so each subject has a @xmath20 moments in the whole brain .",
    "we analyzed these multivariate summaries using gls with @xmath21 as the response variable .",
    "using the gls analysis just described we picked up group differences in the dmn in the time domain in dimensions 4 and 5 and in the whole brain in the fourier domain .",
    "the group difference in the dmn in the time domain in dimensions 4 was a robust finding , in the sense that it manifested itself in a number of analyses .",
    "the essence of the difference is that fewer adhd subjects ( 64.0% ) had any homology in the time domain in the dmn in dimension 4 ( i.e. , only 64% had any 4-dimensional holes ; this represents @xmath22-order dependence by equation ) than did controls ( 92.6% ) .    in the dmn in the fourier domain",
    "the euler characteristic of the frame in frequency level 1 is typically higher among the adhd subjects ( mean = 1.68 , sd = 2.53 ) than it is among the controls ( mean = 0.415 , sd = 1.12 ) , another robust finding .    as an informal analysis",
    ", we observed in some experiments that the homology one gets from simulated data in which all the regions function independently of each other is far different from what one finds in the real fmri data .",
    "obviously , brain regions do not function independently of each other .",
    "it is reassuring that concurrence homology recognizes this in the data .",
    "we describe further findings concerning the fmri data set in section [ ss : localization.in.fmri.data ] .",
    "`` localization '' offers a higher resolution description of the topology of the filtered curto - itskov complex .",
    "having found a hole ( i.e. , homology class ) , it is natural to ask what variables ( regions , in our case ) are involved ?",
    "existence of a hole in the filtered complex requires the cooperation of all variables , but some variables are more directly involved than others .    for simplicity",
    "consider dimension @xmath23 ( third - order dependence , by equation ) . in dimension 1 ,",
    "a `` cycle '' ( `` 1-cycle '' ) is a union of one or more closed polygons made up of 1-simplices in the complex .",
    "( in general , a @xmath15-cycle is a union of closed polyhedra made up of @xmath15-simplices in the complex . )",
    "e.g. , using an obvious notation , in figure [ f : toy.filtered.conc.cmplxes ] , data set i , @xmath24 is a 1-cycle .",
    "that cycle is `` short '' because it consists of just three 1-simplices . in general ,",
    "a `` short '' @xmath15-cycle is one consisting of @xmath25 simplices , the smallest number that can form a @xmath15-cycle .",
    "a homology class consists of cycles that wrap around one or more holes .",
    "all holes are surrounded by cycles . but not all holes are surrounded by _ short _ cycles .",
    "e.g. , in figure [ f : toy.filtered.conc.cmplxes ] again , there are no short cycles that surround the hole marked `` @xmath26 '' .",
    "conversely , even if a homology class has a short cycle , in general it will also have cycles that are not short . by `` localization '' of a hole ,",
    "we mean finding _ all _ short cycles , but only short cycles , that surround that hole , if there are any .",
    "( @xcite discusses a different notion of localization . )",
    "we computed the localization of _ all _ holes in various dimensions in all subjects .",
    "( for this paper , localization was carried out separately for each frequency level , i.e. , persistence of homology classes was ignored in the localization . )",
    "a short one dimensional cycle involves three regions . in the dmn in the time domain we found 7,427 distinct short 1-cycles across all subjects .",
    "( there are 40 regions in the dmn . @xmath27",
    "distinct short cycles are theoretically possible for a single subject ; median number of distinct short 1-cycles per subject = 260 . )",
    "one subject has a one - dimensional homology class ( hole ) containing 164 short 1-cycles in a single frequency level .",
    "we select the most important short cycles using two criteria .",
    "the first is the number of subjects having the cycle and the second is the lifespan of the cycle .",
    "a cycle may represent homology across a range of frequency levels .",
    "the `` lifespan '' of the cycle is the number of frequency levels in which it does so .",
    "the lifespan of a cycle can never be longer than that of the persistent homology class to which it belongs .",
    "the short cycle whose homology class persistence is plotted at the point marked by `` * '' in figure [ f : one.subj.dmn.td.d1.pers.plot ] appears in 13 subjects and , for subject `` sub01912 '' , has cycle lifespan = 8 .",
    "call this cycle @xmath28 . in subject",
    "`` sub01912 '' this triplet of regions is well connected at second - order , but , comparatively speaking , not even indirectly well connected at order 3 .",
    "we performed an analysis under the null hypothesis that all possible 9,880 triplets of default mode regions are equally likely to be short cycles in a given subject .",
    "we assumed that short cycles were selected from the 9,880 independently _ between _ subjects , but not necessarily independently _ within _ subjects .",
    "then , based on a simple model , a heavily bonferronized upper bound on the probability that _ some _ triplet will be a short cycle for 13 or more subjects is 0.021 . thus , @xmath28 is rather special .",
    "now , presence of @xmath28 itself does not differentiate the adhd and control groups , but the 29 short cycles that wrap tightly around the same hole that @xmath28 does in subject `` sub01912 '' _ do _ distinguish the groups .",
    "we can refine this .",
    "16 of the 29 short cycles appear at least twice each in each diagnostic group .",
    "19 out of 25 adhd subjects ( 76% ) have at least one of the 16 short cycles , but only 18 out of 41 controls ( 44% ) have any .",
    "this difference was another of our robust findings .",
    "the frequencies of occurrence of each of the 13 regions involved in any of the 16 short cycles are very similar in the two groups . neither do the groups differ in frequency of occurrence of any particular short cycle among 16 .",
    "it appears that there is a particular hole or family of related holes that occur in many of the subjects filtered curto - itskov complexes .",
    "we are detecting a subtle more or less reproducible feature in the data that presumably would be common in people in the general control and adhd populations , but more commonly in the latter .      in dimension @xmath29 ,",
    "a short cycle involves six regions .",
    "out of @xmath30 theoretically possible 4-dimensional short cycles in the dmn - time domain 1,497 appear in the data .",
    "the median number of distinct short 4-cycles per subject is 12.5 .    call a class `` narrow '' if it has at least one short representative cycle .",
    "thus , the holes marked `` @xmath31 '' in figure [ f : toy.filtered.conc.cmplxes ] are narrow , while the holes marked `` @xmath26 '' are not .",
    "homology classes can be summed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) .",
    "say that two narrow classes are `` adjacent '' if their sum is also narrow .",
    "( the holes corresponding to the adjacent classes do not actually have to be next to each other in space . )",
    "the presence of adjacent pairs of classes in dimension 4 does not discriminate the diagnostic groups , but it does discriminate genders : only 1 out of the 25 females have any adjacent class pairs , but 13 out of the 41 males do .",
    "there are 92 regions in the `` whole brain '' . out of @xmath32 distinct theoretically possible 2-dimensional short cycles in the whole brain and fourier domain , 7,933 appear in the data . the median number of distinct short 2-cycles per subject = 57.5 .",
    "( a short 2-cycle involves four regions . )",
    "the `` corpus callosum '' consists of white matter and until recently only grey matter was believed to produce a bold signal @xcite .",
    "however , the corpus callosum region that appears in the fewest number of 2-cycles appears 909 times , which is more often than any non - corpus callosum region appears and much larger than the median number of times ( 249 ) that non - corpus callosum regions appear .",
    "of the 2,794,155 possible quadruplets of whole brain regions , 20% include a region from the corpus callosum , but of the distinct short 2-cycles in the data 65% include a callosum region .",
    "thus , the corpus callosum frequently takes part in quadruplets that are weakly connected at fourth - order .",
    "however , _ positive _ dependence at third - order is needed in order to form a short 2-cycle .",
    "so the five corpus callosum regions can not be said to be weakly functionally connected to other regions in general .",
    "( see remark [ r : high.dim.holes ] . )",
    "concurrence topology is designed for binary data .",
    "the fmri bold signal is continuous . for each region we determined at which time points",
    "the region is `` active '' and at which it is `` inactive '' by dichotomizing fmri bold values .",
    "there is no single level of fmri bold that demarcates activity from inactivity , because fmri bold levels in different regions are incomparable .",
    "so a separate threshold is needed for each region ( in each subject ) .",
    "a potential complication is that in some cases dichotomizing can merely amplify noise .",
    "brain functional connectivity means covariation . without variation",
    "there is no covariation .",
    "the little variation shown by a nearly constant activity level is liable to be noise .",
    "dichotomizing such a slightly varying noise series will amplify it and introduce a noisy binary component in the multivariate series .",
    "therefore , in the fmri data , for _ each subject separately _ we discarded the 20% least variable regions .",
    "so different subjects may have different regions dropped .",
    "( one subject had fmri bold values of 0 for all time points in two regions , likely due to either missing or inaccurate automated labeling of the regions .",
    "for that subject those two regions were also dropped . )",
    "this was done separately for the whole brain and dmn .",
    "we measured variability by a robust version of the coefficient of variation : interquartile range divided by median .",
    "whether or not our reasoning in favor of dropping the least variable regions is sound , it is expedient : if all regions are included , the computation of homology takes much longer than if low variability regions are dropped .",
    "we stress the analysis does not start _ after _ the 20% least variable regions are dropped .",
    "dropping the least variable regions is the _ first step _ in the analysis .",
    "so this step does not compromise the agnostic nature ( section [ s : intro ] ) of our method .",
    "the distribution of regions that were dropped did not differ between the adhd and control groups , but did depend on age and sex .    in the time domain , separately for each subject and region retained for that subject , we deemed the 20% ( 39 ) time points at which the fmri bold value was highest as `` active '' . in the fourier domain , for each subject and region we set the threshold at the @xmath33 percentile of power , because the fmri bold time series had low power in about the highest half of the fourier frequencies and 20% of half the fourier frequencies is the same as 10% of all of them .",
    "concurrence topology is a nonparametric method for describing high - order dependence in dichotomous data .",
    "we described a particular approach to concurrence topology , called `` concurrence homology '' . using an fmri data set as a test bed",
    ", we explored a number of different ways of deploying concurrence topology .",
    "these included persistence , euler characteristics , and several different ways of mining localizations and found numerous interesting apparent structures in the data .",
    "these findings are only exploratory but we intend to try to replicate our findings in an appropriate independent data set .",
    "the thresholds used in dichotomization ( section [ s : dichotomization ] ) are tuning constants of the method .",
    "our choices are based on informal experiments on a smaller data set independent of our fmri data set .",
    "more experimentation with tuning constants is needed , but is difficult because of the lengthy computing times .",
    "concurrence homology is computationally intensive but , with that proviso , concurrence topology can be applied , not just to fmri bold data , but to any multivariate dichotomous data .",
