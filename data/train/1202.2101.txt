    "supersymmetric gauge theories play an important role in both phenomenological and purely theoretical aspects .",
    "it is very natural to try to find a way to define supersymmetric theories nonperturbatively : a lattice regularization is a nice candidate .",
    "there have been proposed several approaches to the lattice regularization of supersymmetric yang - mills theories in the past decade ( for reviews see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "most of them possess at least one exact supertransformation , which has an interpretation of a scalar supercharge in terms of topological twist .",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) algebra contains _ infinitesimal _ translations but the lattice allows only finite translations : the susy algebra needs to be represented by the finite translation . the ( full ) susy is broken at the finite lattice spacing , without introducing non - standard properties such as non - locality  @xcite .    in two dimensions the above mentioned exact scalar symmetry is strong enough to guarantee a restoration of full supersymmetry without fine tuning  @xcite , which was explicitly checked in monte carlo simulations  @xcite for a model by sugino  @xcite . in one dimension , a non - lattice approach without any exact supersymmetry at finite cutoff provides fine tuning free regularization  @xcite .",
    "other fine tuning free lattice / non - lattice models for gauge theories are found in  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that some of the known lattice formulations treat fermions as link variables .",
    "since the gauge fields are treated as link variables on the lattice , it is quite natural to introduce fermions on links as superpartner of bosonic link variables .",
    "here we focus on a 2-dimensional @xmath1 system , which is the well studied system on the lattice . a model proposed in @xcite ( ckku model )",
    "was derived from a matrix model by using orbifolding , which naturally gives fermionic link variables .",
    "a geometrical approach @xcite also uses link fermions . in @xcite ,",
    "the present author together with his collaborators tried to introduce supercharges on links as well ( link approach ) .",
    "the link approach originally intended to keep the full exact supersymmetry on the lattice at finite lattice spacing , but was turned out to be equivalent to the ckku model  @xcite . on the other hand , a model proposed by sugino ( sugino model ) , which also keeps the exact scalar supercharge ,",
    "treat the fermion as site variables  @xcite .",
    "both the ckku model and the sugino model describe the same target system in the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , both models give the same numerical results  @xcite . see @xcite for other approaches to this system and relation among the formulations , and @xcite for recent numerical studies .",
    "note that this system is a 2-dimensional cousin of 4-dimensional @xmath4 system in terms of dirac - khler twist @xcite .",
    "there are two types of topological twist in 2-dimensional @xmath1 systems and ckku and sugino models use different ones .",
    "they are called a - model twist and b - model twist .",
    "a - model twist combines the spacetime rotation and the internal @xmath5 rotation .",
    "b - model uses the internal @xmath6 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "ckku model uses b - model twist and sugino model uses a - model twist .",
    "we list further differences between the two formulations in table  [ tab : difference1 ] .",
    ".comparison of the sugino model and the ckku model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a potential difficulty of ckku model is a stability of @xmath3 part of the scalar . in this paper , we removed the @xmath3 part so there is no problem about the stability .",
    "however , due to the admissibility condition we introduced , the action became rather complicated . removing",
    "the @xmath3 part removed the problem with the stability of the @xmath3 part of the scalar .",
    "we still need to take care of flat directions of the potential for the @xmath0 part of the scalar , by using large enough @xmath7 or a mass term , for example .",
    "it is interesting to introduce matter multiplet to this model .",
    "a lattice model for 2-dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd in  @xcite has similar degenerate vacua in the pure gauge sector , but they are resolved thanks to effects by the matter sector .",
    "the same thing might apply to our model .",
    "the author thanks h.  suzuki and d.  kadoh for critical comments and discussions on the preliminary work .",
    "discussions with f.  sugino were quite useful to complete this work .",
    "he also thanks f.  bruckmann , s.  catterall and m.  hanada .",
    "he thanks all the member of theoretical physics laboratory in riken and okayama institute for quantum physics for their hospitalities during his stay .",
