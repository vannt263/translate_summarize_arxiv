    "the collapse of a dense cloud core into a star happens rapidly @xcite and therefore is rarely observed ; furthermore , most dense cores appear not to be collapsing but to be close to equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the process of collapse is so rarely observed , there is considerable debate about what triggers it and how it proceeds to form a star .",
    "additional examples of dense cores in extreme states that indicate either collapse or a condition just prior to collapse are critical to constrain theories about the first stages of star formation .",
    "mm - wave line observations are the traditional means to search for collapsing cloud cores , such as in the pioneering study by @xcite .",
    "the subsequent discussion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) illustrates the ambiguities in the interpretation of velocity data in star forming dense cores .",
    "alternative observational approaches are necessary to supplement such line measurements and provide a better understanding of collapsing and nearly - collapsing dense cores .    in this paper",
    "we characterize the structure of the extremely dense core l429 , using the infrared shadow technique we have demonstrated on two other globules @xcite .",
    "this core is already known to have an extremely high deuterium fraction , believed to be an indication of its being very close to collapsing into a protostar , and a low internal temperature of only @xmath2  k , reducing pressure support to low levels @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected a 7  shadow from l429  using isocam .",
    "here , we report that this shadow is so opaque that it is detectable at 70  .",
    "the presence of significant absorption at this long wavelength demonstrates that l429  is indeed extremely dense .",
    "our analysis of the shadow also demonstrates that it is very compact with a steep density gradient .",
    "we show how these characteristics put l429  in the collapsing or near  collapsing starless core category .",
    "l429  was observed by _",
    "spitzer _ using mips , program i d 30384 , p.i .",
    "tyler l. bourke , and with the irac instrument , program i d 20386 , p.i .",
    "philip c. myers .",
    "the mips observations utilized scan map mode in all three bands .",
    "the data reductions were carried out as described in @xcite .",
    "the mips images are @xmath3 in size , with exposure times of @xmath4  s at 24  , @xmath5  s at 70  , and @xmath6  s at 160  . for the 70  and 24  data respectively the beam size is @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the nominal default pixel scale is @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the pixel scale in our images is @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the irac reductions were carried out as described in @xcite .",
    "the irac images are @xmath13 in size , with exposure times of @xmath14  s. the _ spitzer _ data are shown in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "we also use the 2mass all  sky point source catalog ( psc ) @xcite photometry for two well  detected sources within @xmath15 of the center of l429reddening estimates for these sources , assuming the @xcite extinction levels , are plotted in figure  [ fig : av ] .",
    "the commonly accepted distance to l429  is 200  pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the likely association of this cloud with the aquila rift .",
    "@xcite find a distance to the aquila rift based on the co line v@xmath16  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "they summarize the results of various studies and conclude that the distance to the aquila rift is consistent with @xmath18  pc .",
    "more recently , @xcite derive a distance to the near side of the rift of @xmath19  pc , while @xcite derive a distance to an aquila cloud complex centered at @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath22  pc , both consistent with previous studies .",
    "the depth of the absorption feature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : img ] ) implies that l429must lie on the near side of , or in front of , the aquila rift because substantial amounts of foreground material would be warmed by the interstellar radiation field and would dilute the shadow .",
    "we assume a distance of 200  pc , consistent with previous distance determinations .",
    "if the distance to l429  is larger the derived mass will increase , making the core less stable and more likely to be collapsing .",
    "l429  is seen in absorption at @xmath23  70  ; at 160  there is large - scale emission but no isolated local peak is observed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : img ] ) .",
    "in addition , no compact emission source is detected at any _ spitzer _ wavelength within the shadow , and so no source of luminosity @xmath24  l@xmath25 is present @xcite .",
    "we derive extinction profiles from the observed shadows at 70 , 25 , 8.0 , and 5.8  using techniques similar to those discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the first step in deriving the 70  profile is to subtract from the image a value that represents zodiacal emission and other foreground sources . for l429",
    "the shadow is the darkest part of the image .",
    "for this reason the image zero level can not be determined directly from the image itself . to set an upper limit on the optical depth ,",
    "we zero the image using the lowest pixel value in a @xmath26 box centered on the shadow ; in this case the zero value is @xmath27  mjy  sr@xmath17 below the mean pixel flux level immediately outside the shadow .",
    "ideally , one would compute the minimum value based on more pixels .",
    "however , the 70  pixel size is a non - negligible fraction of the size of the core of absorption feature ; taking more pixels would dilute the depth of the shadow .",
    "we use iras data to set the lower limit on the optical depth profile : we measure the flux level outside the shadow to be @xmath28  mjy  sr@xmath17 above the foreground component of emission , interpolated to 70  from the 60 and 100  iras images and estimated far away from regions with significant emission ( about @xmath29 away ) . for this value ,",
    "the minimum shadow value is @xmath30  mjy  sr@xmath17 above the image zero level .",
    "this zero level is a very conservative estimate because the shadow region is surrounded by high levels of emission which are very likely to raise the foreground contribution above the level we use here .",
    "this lower limit also accounts for the mips 70  calibration error , @xmath31% @xcite , and the iras extended source calibration error , which can be as large as @xmath32% @xcite .    after zeroing the image we mask out all pixels with possible emission above the sky level .",
    "the mask threshold is set to the mean value plus @xmath33 measured for pixels in a @xmath34 region @xmath35 north of the shadow .",
    "next we measure the mean pixel values , termed @xmath36 here , in nested , and concentric , circular regions , with radii starting at @xmath37 and increasing in @xmath38 steps , out to @xmath39 , centered at ra = @xmath40 , dec = @xmath41 ( j2000 ) , without accounting for fractions of pixels .",
    "we ignore all pixels in the southern half of the shadow because the shadow has a tail extending to the south and the assumption of spherical symmetry breaks down ( see figure  [ fig : img ] ) . finally , to determine the optical depth at 70  , @xmath42 , we average profile values at radii @xmath43 to measure @xmath44 , the intrinsic , unobscured local flux value . the outer radius of the core at 70  , equal to @xmath45 ,",
    "is set by the observed flattening of the measured flux profile at that radius , indicating that there is little to no absorption at larger radii .",
    "following @xcite , we derive the 70  @xmath46 profile shown in figure  [ fig : av ] with open triangles : downward  pointing triangles represent the upper limit and the upward  pointing triangles represent the lower limit .",
    "the innermost region has an optical depth of @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( upper and lower limits ) .",
    "the total mass ( gas plus dust ) implied by the 70  profile is given by @xmath49 where we have assumed a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 and the @xcite model dust opacity for coagulated dust grains of @xmath50  @xmath51  gm@xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath52  is the _ upper limit _ on the mass ; the _ lower limit _ mass is @xmath53  . the enclosed mass profile is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mass ] .",
    "as noted earlier , our limits on @xmath54 are very conservative .",
    "we performed an error analysis to measure the effect of a reasonable perturbation in the assumed zero level and the calculated value for @xmath44 and find that the errors are absorbed into the limits by a wide margin . for a dust opacity of @xmath55  @xmath51  gm@xmath17 , from the @xmath56 model from @xcite",
    ", we calculate a 70  mass of @xmath57  .",
    "the method used to derive the shorter wavelength profiles is essentially the same as described above .",
    "first , we zero the images using the darkest pixel in the shadow .",
    "second , the mask threshold is determined from the pixel value distribution in the sky region .",
    "we measure the mean pixel value in circular regions starting with a radius of @xmath10 and increasing in steps of @xmath10 , out to a radius @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is determined by averaging pixel values between radii of @xmath15 and @xmath58 .",
    "these radii were chosen based on a flattening of the 24  profile in this region . at radii between @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "the profile continues to rise , likely due to contamination from other nearby sources .",
    "using larger values of @xmath44 would artificially increase @xmath54 .",
    "this choice of @xmath44 is further justified by the 8.0 and 5.8  profiles : they show an increase in the mean pixel value well past @xmath15 but a decreasing value approaching the inner estimate at radii larger than @xmath60 , and by a radius of @xmath61 the profiles match the inner values .",
    "this increase in the profile values at intermediate radii may be caused by limb brightening of the core as it is irradiated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "if the emission raises the observed shadow flux then it will cause an underestimate of @xmath54 at all wavelengths ; however , if it predominantly increases the unobscured flux levels outside the shadow @xmath54 will be over  estimated .",
    "we do not attempt to correct for this effect .",
    "we calculate optical depth limits of @xmath62 and @xmath63 through the center of the profiles .",
    "the implied total masses at these wavelengths is @xmath64  for all three profiles , assuming @xcite model dust opacities .",
    "the discrepancy between this mass and the 70  mass ( between 1.6 and 5.1  ) most likely results from the high optical depth in the core .",
    "if the core is dense enough to be observed in absorption at 70  then it is certainly opaque at shorter wavelengths ; the @xmath46 profile and mass estimates at shorter wavelengths will be lower limits . in the cb190 case",
    "the core was observed in absorption at 24  but not at 70  , and the maximum measured extinction value was @xmath65  mag ( @xmath66 ) , much smaller than the values measured here @xcite .",
    "therefore we reject all 24 , 8.0 , and 5.8  @xmath67 points and we scale the profiles to match the 70  extinction values at the outer two 70  radii . in figure",
    "[ fig : av ] we plot the scaled profiles ; the shapes of the profiles match well .",
    "bonnor - ebert models are often used to characterize starless cores ; these models generally fit the observed density profiles with reasonable fidelity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bonnor - ebert models describe a self  gravitating pressure confined isothermal sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the density profiles are described by three parameters : temperature , central density @xmath68 ( or equivalently , @xmath69 ) , and the outer radius of the cloud .",
    "a model will be unstable to collapse if @xmath70 .",
    "we fit said models to the extinction profiles discussed above .",
    "we use a 3d grid of models in temperature , radius , and @xmath69 ; see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the models and the fitting method .",
    "one strong constraint in interpreting the best ",
    "fit models is that l429  is dark at @xmath71  , and therefore the temperature can not be greater than @xmath72  k , in agreement with other core temperature measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fit models for the upper and lower bounds on the 70  profile are shown in figure  [ fig : av ] as grey dashed lines .",
    "the 70  profile has a best  fit temperature of @xmath73  k , for the upper and lower bounds , respectively ; these temperatures are in clear contradiction with the data .",
    "the best  fit outer radius is @xmath74 , for both the upper and the lower limit , and the best ",
    "fit @xmath69 = 4.5 and 3.0 , for the upper and lower limit respectively . as the assumed distance",
    "is increased ( in this case to 270  pc ) the best ",
    "fit models become even more implausible , with temperatures always @xmath75  k. at a distance of 100  pc the best ",
    "fit temperatures are @xmath76  k , still in contradiction with the data .",
    "these high temperatures indicate that l429  requires additional support ( turbulence and magnetic fields ) beyond thermal to prevent collapse .",
    "@xcite observe n@xmath77d@xmath78 and n@xmath77h@xmath78 line widths @xmath79  km  s@xmath17 and calculate excitation temperatures @xmath80  k. the particle of mean molecular mass has velocity fwhm @xmath81  km  s@xmath17 for temperature 8 k , indicating that the turbulent energy contribution to the support in l429  is only comparable to the thermal contribution @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are a possible source of support in starless cores . inferred magnetic field strengths in cores range from , e.g. , @xmath82 g to @xmath83 g @xcite . for @xmath84 ,",
    "a distance of 200  pc , and @xmath85  @xmath86 g , the mass that can be supported is @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from equation 1 and the @xcite analysis , the condition of stability requires a minimum magnetic field strength of : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the angular radius of the core .",
    "the mean column density of the 70  profile is @xmath90  @xmath91 ; given this column , the correlation presented by @xcite implies a line - of - sight magnetic field of @xmath92  @xmath86 g ; we estimate the total field as @xmath93  @xmath86 g , although this relation has large scatter .",
    "although the field required to support l429  is larger than expected , our understanding of the limits on magnetic field strengths does not allow for a strong constraint .",
    "in addition to requiring a field exceeding the likely range of values , supporting the globule entirely with magnetic pressure has other consequences .",
    "one might expect asymmetries to develop , given the asymmetric pressure provided by magnetism .",
    "if such structures can be avoided @xcite , another issue is that the field should leak out of the globule by ambipolar diffusion , on timescales @xmath94  yr @xcite .",
    "thus , either the field is already too small to prevent the collapse of the globule , or the collapse will only be delayed for a time",
    ".    if infall is occurring in l429 , the observed line width is very narrow .",
    "@xcite detect a double - peaked n@xmath77h@xmath78 @xmath95 line and @xcite detect a double - peaked cs  @xmath96 line , both measurements with roughly equal brightness in the blue and red peaks .",
    "@xcite state that because other thin tracers show single gaussian components , the observed double peak is likely due to self absorption at high optical depth ; these authors also note that l429is one of two sources out of 163 spectra that show small wing components . @xcite",
    "classify l429  as a possible infall candidate based on their observation of cs  @xmath97 , which has a double peaked profile with more emission in the blue peak .",
    "@xcite also measure a double peaked profile in hcn @xmath95 ; they note that this source is one of two ( out of 85 cores surveyed ) that has some line strength anomalies in the three hyperfine hcn lines .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that l429  has a large amount of ortho - h@xmath77d@xmath78(1@xmath981@xmath99 ) emission , which they find to be correlated with increased central concentration , co depletion , and deuteration , providing further evidence that l429  is very evolved .",
    "we measure the density profile of l429  from the 70  absorption feature observed with the _ spitzer _ telescope .",
    "we conclude that :            \\5 .",
    "the magnetic field required to make up the rest of the required pressure for support would be surprisingly large ; even if present , such a large field will leak out of the globule through ambipolar diffusion .",
