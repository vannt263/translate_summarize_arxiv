    "kapitza conductance controls heat transfer at submicronic length scales in heterogeneous and nanostructured materials . for instance in superlattices , which are made of an arrangement of alternating solid layers , the kapitza conductance at the interface between the solids controls the overall conductivity of the superlattice when the internal conductance of the solid layers is large  @xcite .",
    "understanding the value of the kapitza conductance at the interface between solids may thus help in defining directions to minimize or on the contrary maximise the conductivity of the superlattice , with respective applications in energy conversion devices and thermal management . during the last decade , ultrafast measurements techniques",
    "have been developed so that the kapitza conductance at the interface between a number of metal / dielectrics and dielectrics / dielectrics solids has been characterized  @xcite .",
    "similarly , ultrafast laser spectroscopy may also be used to measure the kapitza conductance between a metal and a solid matrix which can be amorphous  @xcite .",
    "all the above - mentioned experiments have concluded that the kapitza conductance is poorly described by the classical amm and dmm models , with sometimes a difference reaching an order of magnitude .",
    "also the temperature dependence predicted by the classical models is wrong , with experiments and simulations pointing at a linear increase of the conductance with the temperature  @xcite when the theories predict a constant value at least if interfacial scattering is supposed to be elastic .",
    "these discrepancies may be partly explained by the state of the interface between real materials whose imperfections may enhance inelastic scattering , thus creating additional energy channels compared with the situation of an ideal interface . in this context theoretical modeling may help in pinpointing the physical relevant mechanisms ruling heat transfer across ideal interfaces . to this end ,",
    "different techniques have been employed including lattice dynamics  @xcite , green function  @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md )  @xcite .",
    "the latter is a promising method as it is relatively easy to use and it makes no assumption regarding interfacial heat tranport except the classical nature of the energy carriers , a reasonable assumption close to the debye temperature of the softer solid .",

    "transport coefficients , two routes may be followed to determine the interfacial conductance between classical solids  : either the system is driven out - of - equilibrium by creating an interfacial flux using two heat reservoirs on both sides of the interface@xcite or the kinetics of thermally induced fluctuations of the interfacial flux may be recorded around the equilibrium situation where the two solids are at the same temperature  @xcite .",
    "this latter method relies on the generalisation of the green - kubo formulae to interfacial transport coefficients  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of the thermal conductivity , no agreement has been found between these two methods even when considering simple systems such as the interface between lennard - jones solids  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we propose a new method to determine the interfacial conductance in the spirit of the emd method using the energy autocorrelation function of each solid on both sides of the interface .",
    "this may solve practical problems frequently encountered in equilibrium simulations when a plateau in the integral of the relevant correlation function should be identified , which often leads to practical difficulties .",
    "we explain the discrepancies between the emd and the nemd simulations determination of the interfacial heat conductance .",
    "we show that the emd yields the _ landauer _ conductance which assumes phonons on both sides of the interface to have equilibrium distribution . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that the conductance measured in nemd is well described by the general expression of simons which accounts for the out - of - equilibrium phonon distribution consistent with the created heat flux@xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the two methods give _ intrinsically _ inconsistent values of the interfacial conductance .",
    "the difference is important and may reach nearly an order of magnitude for solids displaying moderate acoustic mismatch . we analyze also the finite size effects in the two methods and show that emd suffers from stronger size effects than nemd .",
    "finally , we analyze the interfacial conductance at the interface between a series of mass - mismatched lennard - jones solids using both methods .",
    "we show that the classical dmm model provides a good description of the emd data . on the other hand ,",
    "both the amm and dmm models fail to predict the conductance obtained in nemd .",
    "a good agreement is found if we extend the amm model by accounting for the out - of - equilibrium phonon distribution consistent with the imposed interfacial flux .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in the section  [ theory ] , we first review the basics of interfacial heat transport ; we discuss the difference between the landauer conductance which assumes the energy carriers to be described locally by equilibrium distribution functions and the general expression proposed by simons . in the section  [ green - kubo ]",
    ", we show the connection between the landauer conductance and the decay of the energy autocorrelation function in each solid .",
    "this allows us to propose an alternate expression to measure the interfacial conductance using emd .",
    "this methodology is applied in the section  [ simulations ] where we analyze the case of the interface between lennard - jones solids having a variable mass contrast .",

    "if furthermore , we assume that in each medium the temperature profile is linear , an assumption which is again confirmed by nemd simulations  @xcite , then the deviation from the local equilibrium writes : @xmath37 hence , the excess of phonons propagating in each medium is proportional to the heat flux .",

    "<S> we analyze finite size effects for the two determinations of the interfacial thermal conductance , and show that the equilibrium simulations suffer from severe size effects as compared to nemd . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the predictions of the two above mentioned methods -emd and nemd- regarding the interfacial conductance of a series of mass mismatched lennard - jones solids . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the kapitza conductance obtained with emd can be well described using the classical diffuse mismatch model ( dmm ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> nemd simulations results are consistent with a out - of - equilibrium generalisation of the acoustic mismatch model ( amm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations are important in rationalizing previous results obtained using molecular dynamics , and help in pinpointing the physical scattering mechanisms taking place at atomically perfect interfaces between solids , which is a prerequesite to understand interfacial heat transfer across real interfaces . </S>"
