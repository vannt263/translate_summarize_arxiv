    "on the other hand , the quark edms have been estimated in several models @xcite and the edms of nuclei , deutron , neutron and some atoms have been predicted extensively @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study the lepton edms in the two higgs doublet model in which the flavor changing ( fc ) neutral current vertices in the tree level are permitted and the cp violating interactions are carried by complex yukawa couplings . in the calculations ,",
    "we include the effects of a possible new dimension , in the split fermion scenario , where the hierarchy of fermion masses are coming from the overlap of the fermion gaussian profiles in the extra dimension .",
    "in addition to the strong localization of the leptons , we consider that the new higgs scalars are also localized around the the origin , in the extra dimension .",
    "these localizations are the result of the non vanishing couplings between leptons ( new higgs scalars ) and the so called localizer field , which is odd under @xmath5 reflection in the extra dimension .",
    "the split fermion scenario has been studied in several works in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy has been introduced by assuming that the fermions were located at different points in the extra dimensions , with exponentially small overlaps of their wave functions .",
    "the phenomenologically reliable locations of left and right handed components of fermions in the extra dimensions and their roles on the mechanism of yukawa hierarchies have been studied in @xcite .",

    "recently , the higgs localization in the split fermion models has been studied in @xcite .",

    "the localization of the new higgs scalars depends strongly on the strength of the coupling of the localizer to the new higgs scalar . here",
    "we take this coupling small and study the sensitivity of the lepton edms on it .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the compactification scale dependence of lepton edms . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we observe that the lepton edms are sensitive to the new higgs localization in the extra dimension and we estimate that the numerical values of electron ( muon , tau ) edm is at the order of the magnitude of @xmath7 e - cm , even for the large values of the compactification scale @xmath8 and for the intermediate values of yukawa couplings .",

    "since the theoretical estimated numerical values of the fermion edms are considerably small , there is a need to go beyond the sm to get additional contributions , in order to enhance their numerical values .",
    "the multi higgs doublet models are the among the candidates for this enhancement , and , in the present work , we take the 2hdm , which allows the fcnc at tree level and includes the complex yukawa couplings as a source of cp violation . on the other hand , with the addition of extra dimensions , there exist new contributions sensitive to the compactification scale @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the compactification radius of the extra dimension . here , we take the effects of extra dimensions into account with the assumption that the hierarchy of lepton masses are coming from the lepton gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions , so called the split fermion scenario .",
