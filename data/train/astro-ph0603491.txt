    "scaling relationships among galaxies provide many of the principal constraints on galaxy evolution models . as such , the",
    " fundamental manifold \" of spheroids ( hereafter fm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which spans a factor of 1000 in effective radius @xmath0 and of 100 in velocity dispersion @xmath1 , poses a challenge to models of the formation of kinematically hot stellar components embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "@xcite focused principally on relating the structural properties of the spheroidal stellar component of the largest known virialized systems , the intracluster stars of galaxy clusters ( csph ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to those of more common spheroids such as giant ( e ) and dwarf ( de ) elliptical galaxies .",
    "they considered the efficiency with which baryons are packed relative to dark matter within @xmath0 ( as measured by the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath2 ) and found that the existence of the spheroid fm implies a @xmath3 relationship that continues to steepen with @xmath1 from es to csphs .",
    "in other words , the packing of baryons relative to dark matter within @xmath0 is less efficient for these spheroids as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the behavior for spheroids with still smaller values of @xmath1 , des and dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , was inconclusive . in this letter",
    ", we consider this low-@xmath1 extreme of spheroid scale , using eight galactic dsphs and four de companions of m 31 to investigate how well the smallest and most compact galaxies map onto the extrapolation of the fm . finally , we speculate on how the behavior of the fm for these lowest mass galaxies might be used to constrain galaxy formation models .    [",

    "we searched the literature for the necessary data for every dwarf elliptical and spheroidal in the local group .",
    "the data ( table 1 , figure [ fig : fm ] ) come from various sources .",
    "we calculate the half light radii for the galactic dwarf spheroidals using the king model fit parameters given by @xcite . for the andromeda systems ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath0 given by @xcite for m 32 and ngc 147 , fit to kent s photometry for ngc 185 , and use the value given by @xcite for ngc 205 . the mean surface brightness within @xmath0 , @xmath4 ,",
    "is evaluated using the total luminosity and a circular aperture defined by @xmath0 . for consistency with the data used by @xcite , we convert magnitudes from @xmath5 to cousins @xmath6 using the color transformation for ellipticals from @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to correct @xmath0 for any possible color dependencies .",
    "the errorbars represent the propagated uncertainty due to the quoted statistical errors in @xmath1 , the apparent magnitude , and the distance .",
    "errors in the half - light or effective radius are not included as they affect both the ordinate and abscissa such that the data points move nearly parallel to the projection of the fundamental manifold ( see figure 1 for a demonstration ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion uncertainties are the dominant source of the plotted errors .",
    "we compare the position of these 12 dwarfs to the fm of @xcite in figure 1 .",
    "we have not modified the old relationship to optimize the fit to this new set of points .",
    "the @xmath7 value of only these new data with respect to the existing model is 1.91 .",
    "this value is high , even for the relatively small sample given here ( such a value can be ruled out as random with @xmath8 98% confidence ) .",
    "however , this apparent discrepancy is due solely to ursa minor ( umi ) and draco ( without these two galaxies , @xmath7 drops to 0.82 ) .",
    "apart from the two outliers , which are discussed in more detail below , the other 10 systems extend the fm relation nearly a decade lower in effective radius .",
    "the continuity of the locus of spheroids on the fm , from csphs to des , suggested a single family of spheroids @xcite .",
    "the overlap here between des and the galactic dsphs indicates that even dsphs are part of this family .",
    "a further example of the continuity of spheroid properties on the fm is that one of the highest surface brightness galaxies known , m 32 , lies next to one of the lowest surface brightness galaxies , leo ii .",
    "these two galaxies also differ in velocity dispersion by nearly a factor of ten .",
    "m 32 s presence on the fm suggests that unless tidal stripping works to move objects along the fm , m 32 has been only modestly disturbed by its interaction with m 31 ( a similar conclusion is reached through other arguments by * ? ? ?",
    "we note that even for the 10 dwarfs that are statistically consistent with the fm extrapolation , there may be a small but systematic deviation .",
    "all but one of the dwarf galaxies lie above the fm projection , while at larger values of @xmath0 ( @xmath9 , @xmath0 in kpc ) the data appear to lie systematically below the line .",
    "these systematic deviations may indicate that there is a more precise fit to the global fm than that presented by @xcite .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the measurements ( see the scatter in published @xmath10 values for the galactic dsphs in table 1 ) , the possible systematic behavior of @xmath0 with color , the use of a single universal color term across the entire range of systems , and the difficulties in defining @xmath1 , it is premature to fine - tune the fm coefficients .",
    "returning to the two outliers , draco and umi , we discuss three possible causes ( in order of least to most astronomically interesting ) : 1 ) the difficulty in measuring the basic fundamental parameters of these systems has been underestimated , leading to overly optimistic errorbars or to systematic errors , 2 ) these two galaxies are experiencing tidal forces that affect their internal kinematics and structure such that they no longer lie on the fm , or 3 ) these two galaxies , which have the lowest luminosities of all the galaxies in the sample , mark the breakdown of the tight fm relationship at low luminosities , and so identify the location in this parameter space at which baryons and dark matter no longer follow the same  rules \" of galaxy formation .",

    "errors in the apparent magnitude and distance are unlikely to cause such a large discrepancy . for example , to bring draco back onto the fm requires an error in the absolute magnitude of 2.86 mag .",
    "even though one could parcel this error into errors in the apparent magnitude , color conversion , and distance , these errors would still be unreasonably large .",
    "alternatively , one could place draco on the fm with a modest change of its velocity dispersion from 8.5 @xcite to 5 km sec@xmath14 .",
    "is such a systematic error likely",
    "?    measurements of the velocity dispersions of dsphs have improved greatly over the past two decades and now come from samples of hundreds of stars .",
    "the quoted uncertainty on the measurement we use is 0.7 km sec@xmath14 @xcite , so the required change in @xmath1 from 8.5 to 5 km s@xmath14 appears unlikely on purely statistical grounds .",
    "recent , larger studies @xcite confirm the global velocity dispersion from @xcite , although they do find radial gradients in @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion used in the fm relationship is supposed to be that measured within @xmath0 , although we generally assume flat dispersion profiles and adopt the measured global value .",
    "the dispersion profile presented by @xcite suggests that @xmath1 could be as low as @xmath15 6 km sec@xmath14 over a centrally limited radius , which could help to reconcile draco s position relative to the fm .",
    "however , umi has a velocity dispersion gradient of the opposite sign , so its central @xmath1 is larger than the global value . taking a more central value for @xmath1 would increase the discrepancy between umi s location in figure 1 and the fm .",
    "we conclude that although the newly identified velocity dispersion gradients complicate the picture ( and so perhaps lessen the discrepancy by increasing the errorbars ) , they do not act in a systematic manner to address the current discrepancy between the fm and the properties of umi and draco .",
    "proceeding to option 2 , we can speculate that these two systems are not well described by simple dynamics .",
    "they are the two closest galaxies to the milky way among our set , as well as the two of lowest luminosity . because of these properties",
    ", it is often suggested that draco and umi are victims of tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that this galaxy is not a simple , dynamically relaxed system because of the unphysically large inferred mass ( implying @xmath16 900 ) based on their measurement of a large @xmath1 far from umi s core .",
    "such arguments favor the interpretation that the dynamics of these systems are somewhat disturbed , that the velocity dispersions are affected , and that these systems should lie off the fm .",
    "the critical test of this interpretation is to determine where other low luminosity spheroids , especially those far from the milky way or m31 and thus unperturbed by tidal forces , fall with respect to the fm .",
    "there are at least two other local group objects that are particularly interesting for this discussion given their low luminosity : the ursa major dwarf @xcite and and ix @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the data are not yet of the quality necessary to impact this discussion .",
    "the magnitude and structural parameters of uma are currently crude estimates , although improved data are on the way . if we do adopt the published structural parameters @xcite , then uma lies well above the fm , as do umi and draco . the data for and ix are further along @xcite , but the velocity dispersion is still somewhat problematic .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion is almost zero at small radii and then rises quickly with radius .",
    "the global velocity dispersion value may therefore be misleading .",
    "nevertheless , if we adopt the published value , we find that and ix is also above the fm relationship , although only by 1.1 standard deviations given the large uncertainty .",
    "improving the data on these two galaxies is key because they probe the low - luminosity end of the spheroid distribution .",
    "finally , considering option 3 , we restate that draco and umi are the lowest luminosity galaxies plotted in figure [ fig : fm ] and that the preliminary data discussed above for two other low luminosity dwarfs show consistent deviations from the fm . as such , draco and umi might be indicative of a breakdown in the coherence of the fm at these luminosities .",
    "do we expect such a breakdown ?    as discussed by @xcite , the trend of @xmath17 with @xmath1 that leads to the fm can be physically interpreted as a trend in the packing efficiency of baryons relative to dark matter within @xmath0 .",
    "they concluded that the packing is inefficient for the systems with largest @xmath1 ( csphs and bcgs ) , becomes highly efficient for systems with moderate @xmath1 ( es ) , and , with less certainty , becomes inefficient once again in systems with low @xmath1 ( des ) .",
    "the continuation of the fm relationship here to even lower @xmath1 systems confirms that the packing of baryons relative to dark matter is highly inefficient in the systems with the lowest @xmath1 s .",
    "the key to a tight fm lies in the maintaining this pattern in the relative distributions of baryons and dark matter among all spheroids .",
    "if there is a class of spheroids for which a change in the distribution of baryons due to non - gravitational physics is not accompanied by a corresponding change in the distribution of the dark matter , we expect a loss of the fm coherence for those spheroids",
    ".    one such class may be systems in which the baryons are dynamically negligible and that therefore lack a physical connection between the properties of the baryonic ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) and dark ( @xmath1 ) components .",
    "if the baryons in these systems are subject to forces that do not affect the dark matter , such as winds or ram pressure stripping , the dark matter would not respond to changes in baryon distribution .",
    "in other words , the baryons can be distributed , or packed , within the dark matter halo in numerous ways without affecting @xmath1 , and this range of optical @xmath0 s and @xmath4 s will almost certainly break the coherence of the fm .",
    "the baryons are dynamically negligible in low - luminosity systems with large mass - to - light ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and where non - gravitational physics is expected to be important @xcite . as one example of how the fm coherence may be broken , we consider a population of dark - matter - dominated , low - luminosity systems in which varying fractions of baryons have been lost due to supernova winds .",
    "these systems will all have the same @xmath1 ( because the dark matter properties are unaffected by the baryon loss ) , but different values of @xmath4 .",
    "unless @xmath0 conspires to compensate for the change in @xmath4 , this set of objects will lie off the fm by differing amounts .",
    "upward scatter in figure [ fig : fm ] , as seen for draco and umi , corresponds to a lower than predicted effective surface brightness , as would arise if these dsphs are dark - matter - dominated and have experienced baryon loss .",
    "the adherence or deviation of low - mass galaxies from the fm may ultimately help to address one of the key questions facing current hierarchical models  how do galaxies populate low mass halos ?",
    "a wide range of literature has considered the  missing satellite problem \" formalized by @xcite in which cold dark matter cosmological models apparently overpredict the number of low luminosity satellite galaxies .",
    "it is now evident that any solution to this problem must include a delicate balancing act to retain the fm well into the low mass regime where the problem has been identified .",
    "the tightness of the fm relationship down to at least the luminosity of umi and draco suggests that solving the missing satellite problem may require investigating two regimes , namely those in which baryons are and are not dynamically important .",
    "processes that inherently generate significant scatter , such as any that are environmentally driven ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could easily fail to reproduce the low scatter seen in the fm for systems more luminous than umi and draco .",
    "if the other hand , we were able to quantify the scatter along the vertical axis in figure [ fig : fm ] for objects like umi and draco , then that scatter would constrain the variations in mass loss or star formation efficiency allowed as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate that the lowest luminosity , lowest surface brightness , and lowest velocity dispersion spheroidal galaxies currently known fall on the projection of the  fundamental manifold \" ( fm ) defined by @xcite .",
    "the fm now spans nearly four orders of magnitude in effective radius @xmath0 .",
    "the fm is not a simple recasting of the virial theorem , as demonstrated by the complex behavior of the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite that is now extended by these new data .",
    "the fm places a constraint on models of spheroid formation ranging from the dwarf spheroidals of the local group to the intracluster stellar component of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , the manifold describes an increase in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the optically defined effective radius for both the largest and smallest spheroids embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "the continuity of this relationship into the regime of dsphs suggests that these systems are not a distinct class of spheroid and that they have not been grossly affected by interactions with their massive parent galaxy .",
    "the tightness of the fm well into the low mass regime , where the  missing satellite \" problem arises @xcite , suggests that it may be challenging to explain the existing systems as the few sole survivors of a complex and violent history .",
