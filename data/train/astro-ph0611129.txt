    "<S> we carry out a model independent study of resonant photon scattering off dark matter ( dm ) particles . </S>",
    "<S> the dm particle @xmath0 can feature an electric or magnetic transition dipole moment which couples it with photons and a heavier neutral particle @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> resonant photon scattering then takes place at a special energy @xmath2 set by the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the width of the resonance set by the size of the transition dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the constraints on the parameter space of the model from stellar energy losses , data from sn 1987a , the lyman-@xmath3 forest , big bang nucleosynthesis , electro - weak precision measurements and accelerator searches . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the velocity broadening of the resonance plays an essential role for the possibility of the detection of a spectral feature originating from resonant photon - dm scattering . </S>",
    "<S> depending upon the particle setup and the dm surface mass density , the favored range of dm particle masses lies between tens of kev and a few mev , while the resonant photon absorption energy is predicted to be between tens of kev and few gev . </S>"
