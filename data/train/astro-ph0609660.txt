    "the densest and coolest component of the interstellar medium   molecular gas   is observed in all types of disk galaxies . in many cases ,",
    "a mass of molecular gas inside galactic disks is comparable to a mass of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the amount and spatial density of molecular gas reflects the specific properties of the evolution of the interstellar medium in galactic disks .",
    "the most massive gaseous formations   giant molecular clouds , which affect the dynamical evolution of the disk, are associated with molecular gas",
    ". however , more importantly , the mass and density of the molecular gas determine the star - formation rate and star - formation efficiency in galactic disks .    despite the crucial role that molecular gas plays in galaxies ,",
    "the factors determining its abundance relative to neutral gas remain poorly known .",
    "most information on interstellar molecular gas has been obtained from measurements of _ co_-line intensities   _ co _ has a very low excitation temperature .",
    "the conversion of the _ co_-line luminosity into the total mass of gas is a separate problem . for galaxies with normal heavy - element abundances the conversion factor connecting the _ co_-line intensity with the number of @xmath1 molecules along the line of sight , @xmath6 ,",
    "is usually set equal to @xmath7 , however , the universality of this parameter remains a topic of discussion .",
    "adopting a constant @xmath8 value is , of course , a simplification , especially when galaxies with strongly differing mass , gas density , or star - formation intensity are compared .",
    "various methods for measuring @xmath8 and the dependence of @xmath8 on the galactic luminosity show appreciable scatter , together with a systematic increase in @xmath8 with decreasing luminosity ( mass ) of the galaxy and decreasing heavy - element abundance ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the conversion factors for dwarf galaxies and giant luminous galaxies may differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "we also expect @xmath8 to be smaller for dense circumnuclear disks , where the molecular gas seems to be contained in both clouds and the diffuse intercloud medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "various authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have analyzed the conditions for molecular - to - atomic , @xmath9 , transformations and vice - versa ( see also references in these papers ) .",
    "the rate at which molecules are formed depends on both the density ( or pressure ) of a gas and on the density of _ uv _ flux , which destroys molecules . according to elmegreen ( @xcite ) , the @xmath4 ratio is proportional to @xmath10 , where @xmath11  is the gas pressure and  @xmath12  is the _ uv _ flux density .",
    "the gas compression in shocks can also play an important role in the `` molecularization '' of hydrogen  @xcite .    since the gas pressure depends both on its surface density and on the volume density of the stellar disk , it decreases rapidly with galactocentric distance .",
    "indeed , the azimuthally averaged density ratio @xmath4 follows the pressure in such a way that the contribution of @xmath3 to the total mass of gas becomes small at a periphery of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "available estimates show that the integrated ratio @xmath4 is appreciably lower than unity for most spiral galaxies . according to casoli et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 is , on the average , close to @xmath13 .",
    "boselli et al .",
    "@xcite found the average molecular - to - atomic gas mass ratio to be @xmath14 for a sample of 266 galaxies .",
    "however , some spiral galaxies are known to have anomalously high @xmath4 values , exceeding two or even three ( an order of magnitude higher than the average value ) .",
    "our aim here is to analyze the specific features of such galaxies with a predominance of molecular gas and possible factors that could lead to such high @xmath4 estimates .    as our initial data , we used `` a new catalogue of ism content of normal galaxies '' ( cism ) of bettoni et  al .",
    "this catalog contains interstellar - medium data for almost two thousand `` normal '' galaxies , more than 300 of which have estimates for their molecular - gas mass .",
    "normal galaxies are considered to be those that display no morphological distorsion ( such as tidal tails or bridges ) or strong perturbations of their circular velocities , although several galaxies among those included in the catalog can , nevertheless , be considered to be interacting galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "the molecular - gas mass estimate is based on the adopted value of @xmath15 , taken to be the same for all galaxies .",
    "we selected a total of 66 objects with anomalously high ratios @xmath16 from the cism catalog of bettoni et  al .",
    "forty - five of these galaxies have @xmath17 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] gives the main properties of these sample galaxies .",
    "we adopted data on the interstellar medium from cism ; photometric and kinematic properties from the hyperleda @xcite database , and the photometric scale in accordance with the catalog of baggett et  al .",
    "the columns of the table give : a running number for the galaxy , its name , morphological type ( as a number ) , heliocentric distance ( in mpc ) , radial photomeric scale length ( in kpc ) , _ b_-band luminosity ( in solar luminosities ) , photometric diameter @xmath18 ( in kpc ) , logarithm of the dust mass ( in solar units ) , logarithm of the @xmath5 mass ( in solar units ) , logarithm of the mass of molecular gas ( in solar units ) , logarithm of the rotational velocity derived from the widths of @xmath5 ( in km / s ) , and corrected _ u - b _ and  _ b - v _ color indices .",
    "the last column ( `` remarks '' ) shows the presence of a bar ( b ) , membership in the virgo or coma clusters ( v or c ) , and signs of interaction ( vv number according to vorontsov - velyaminov ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] compares the galaxies in our sample with the cism galaxies with known molecular - gas contents ( below , we will consider only this part of all cism catalog ) in terms of their morphological types , surface brightnesses @xmath19 ( within the isophotal diameter @xmath18 ) relative to the average surface brightness @xmath20 for cism galaxies of the same type , absolute b - band magnitude @xmath21 , and rotational velocity @xmath22 derived from the @xmath5 line widths .",
    "these distributions show that galaxies with high @xmath4 ratios are mostly _ sa    sbc _ galaxies ( @xmath23 ) , with virtually no late - type galaxies among them .",
    "note that allowing for the luminosity dependence of the conversion factor does not affect the conclusion that galaxies with late morphological types have lower @xmath4 ratios @xcite .",
    "the galaxies of our sample are essentially indistinguishable from the other cism galaxies in terms of the brightness of their stellar disks and their luminosities , although the mean value for @xmath21 is shifted somewhat toward higher luminosities .",
    "the rotational velocities @xmath22 for the sample galaxies and for all the cism galaxies with available @xmath3 estimates have more or less the same distributions , ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] gives the numerical results of these comparisons : the mean values and standard deviations of the quantities compared , and the probability that the difference between the means of the two samples is of random nature .",
    "we conclude that the objects in our sample do not differ strongly from the other galaxies in terms of the parameters described above .",

    "the latter is also true for the galaxies in our sample with  @xmath16 .",
    "it follows from table  [ tab3 ] that this sample is characterized by high frequency of occurrences of bars and of nuclear activity ( the latter was taken from the catalog  @xcite ) .",
    "this may be indirectly associated with the concentration of a gas toward galactic centers .",
    "the existence of a possible correlation between the abundance of molecular gas and the level of nuclear activity was earlier pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "thus , galaxies with high @xmath4 ratios do not differ significantly from other galaxies in their photometric properties , morphological properties , or rotational velocities .",
