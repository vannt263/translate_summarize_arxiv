    "the construction of ` improved actions ' which reduce discretization errors and allow computation on coarser lattices has been a long - standing area of interest among lattice field theory workers .",
    "ideally , one searches for the ` perfect action ' ( @xcite and references within ) , for which , under successive blocking transformations , the flow is along the wilsonian ` renormalized trajectory ' , and lattice artifacts disappear .",
    "explicit construction , however , has proved rather cumbersome .",
    "a more modest but more readily implementable approach is based on the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) which considers block spinning transformations on configurations obtained by mc simulations .",
    "the basic assumption here is that the block - spinned configurations are distributed according to the boltzmann weight of some effective action that resulted from the blocking to the coarser lattice .",
    "one , however , does not know at the outset what this block effective action is . now , under rg evolution any starting action generally develops a variety of additional couplings . an adequate model of the resulting effective action must , therefore , include a choice of several such couplings . by practical necessity , any ansatz for such a model",
    "is restricted to some subclass of possible interactions . in the past effective models",
    "have been studied with actions consisting of one or more loops beyond the single plaquette in the fundamental representation @xcite , or a mixed fundamental - adjoint single plaquette action @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after a block spinning is performed starting from a simple ( e.g. wilson ) action , one needs to measure the set of couplings retained in one s model of the effective action .",
    "this may be achieved by the use of demon @xcite or schwinger - dyson methods @xcite .",
    "there is a variety of issues that come up in the actual implementation of such a program .",
    "any numerical decimation procedure entails some mutilation and possible loss of information encoded in the original undecimated configurations .",
    "the first thing to be checked then is that the adopted decimation prescription correctly reproduces physics at least at intermediate and long distance scales .    assuming this is the case , some effective action must next be assumed .",
    "it should be noted that the issue of the choice of an effective action model is not divorced from the choice of the decimation procedure .",
    "indeed , in any exact rg transformation , the particular specification , in terms of the original variables , of the blocking procedure and block variables will affect the form of the action which results after integration over the original variables .",
    "thus different decimation procedures , or even different regimes of the parameters entering the specification of one particular decimation procedure , may be fitted better by different effective action models .",
    "having adopted some class of effective actions , errors due to the truncation of the phase space inherent in any such choice may , of course , be significant , and prevent the model from adequately approaching the renormalized trajectory .",
    "this is something that one can in principle check by measurement of appropriate observables probing the scale regime(s ) of interest , and may result in the need for addition of further effective couplings .",
    "there is , however , a more subtle pitfall lurking in a straightforward application of such methods",
    ". a straightforward ` measurement ' of the effective action couplings from the decimated configurations , by any one of the available methods , can actually lead to quite erroneous results .",
    "this is because the decimated configurations will generally _ not _ be representative of the equilibrium configurations of the effective action at the measured couplings . as a result simulations on the coarser lattice with the effective action at these values of the couplings",
    "will not , in general , correctly reproduce the physics encoded in the decimated configurations obtained from the original theory . as far as we know ,",
    "this does not appear to have been realized in previous mcrg gauge theory studies . in this paper",
    "we find that this problem is actually generally present and has to be dealt with .",
    "we use the demon method which provides a clear demonstration of the problem as it allows comparison between the original decimated and microcanonically - evolved decimated configurations in relation to equilibrium configurations of the assumed effective action .    specifically , we explore these issues in numerical decimations in @xmath0 lgt .",
    "a preliminary report on some of our findings was previously given in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce different decimation schemes , as well as the numerical methods we use to implement them .",
    "we check that the decimation procedures correctly reproduce long distance physics .",
    "we then adopt a single plaquette effective action which includes several ( typically five to eight ) successive group representations .",
    "there are special motivations for such actions originating in exact analytical results . in section 3",
    "we present the results of our numerical study .",
    "we examine the relation between the configurations obtained by decimation from the original action and the thermalized configurations of the effective action .",
    "we explore how this affects the determination of the effective couplings and the tuning of the free parameters ( such as the relative weight of staples ) entering in the specification of the decimation scheme .",
    "we then examine how physics is reproduced by measuring observables such as wilson loops of various sizes .",
    "the behavior under repeated decimation is also examined . in section 4",
    "we extract from our results our improved action .",
    "our conclusions and outlook are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in our study we choose to start with the standard wilson action with coupling @xmath1 on the original undecimated lattice . throughout this paper",
    "we use blocking @xmath2 with scale factor @xmath3 in all lattice directions .",
    "we employ two well - known numerical blocking procedures . in terms of the usual lattice gauge field bond variables",
    "@xmath4 , these are :    * swendsen decimation @xcite @xmath5 * double smeared blocking ( dsb)@xcite @xmath6    here @xmath7 is a parameter which controls the relative weight of staples . ) or ( [ eq : dsbdec ] ) , however , suffice for our purposes in this paper . ] for swendsen decimation the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite , whereas for double smeared blocking the classical limit value @xmath10 @xcite have previously been used .",
    "fixing the parameter @xmath7 on a rational rather than ad - hoc basis will be one of our concerns below .",
    "as a typical check on how such decimations preserve the information in the original undecimated configurations , at least at long distances , we look at the quark potential . the original lattice potential was computed with high accuracy ( 20 independent runs each consisting of 300 measurements ) using the lscher - weisz procedure @xcite , while the decimated potentials were computed in the straightforward naive way , which affects their accuracy , but suffices for a check ( from 80 to 160 independent runs each of 3000 measurements ) .",
    "the result of the comparison for swendsen decimation is given in table [ tab : dec_string ] , with average goodness of fit @xmath11 .",
    ".[tab : dec_string]string tension @xmath12 and coulomb term coefficient @xmath13 computed on the original and decimated lattices . swendsen decimation , @xmath14 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a matter of practical expediency , one may want to consider the effective action truncated to just these two couplings at the outset . in table",
    "[ tab : impr_act_2a ] we compare the results of measurements keeping just the two couplings to those keeping all five ( eight ) .",
    "comparison of the two rows of this table indicates the size of systematic error induced by this truncation of the effective action .",
    "the values of the two couplings for different starting @xmath1 s is given in table [ tab : impr_act_2b ] to be compared with those in table [ tab : impr_act ] ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we studied mcrg decimations in @xmath0 lgt employing either dsb or swendsen decimations followed by a search for an effective action in the space of multi - representation single - plaquette actions with up to eight couplings using the demon method .",
    "examination of the demon microcanonical evolution on the decimated configurations reveals the following general feature .",
    "given the couplings of the effective action obtained from the decimated configurations , consider the equilibrium configurations of the effective action at these couplings .",
    "then the decimated configurations are not , in general , representative of these equilibrium configurations .",
    "this means that simulations with the effective action at these couplings will not reproduce measurements of observables obtained from the decimated configurations as demonstrated in section 3 above .",
    "if sufficient microcanonical evolution of the decimated configurations is allowed , they will eventually result into configurations that are indeed equilibrium configurations of the effective action , that is the effective action at couplings obtained from these evolved decimated configurations . but the evolved decimated configurations are no longer the original decimated configurations , and can not be relied upon to still adequately encode information from the original undecimated lattice .",
    "solving this problem means having decimated configurations that are already equilibrium configurations of the adopted form of the effective action at the couplings obtained from the decimated configurations .",
    "this in general requires fine - tuning of the decimation and/or the effective action .    in the case of the type of decimations and effective action adopted in this study",
    ", we saw that this fine - tuning could be achieved by fixing the value of the staple weight parameter @xmath7 in the specification of the decimation procedure , and retaining sufficient number of couplings .",
    "also , this tuning works somewhat better for dsb decimations than swendsen decimations .",
    "the result is the improved action presented in table [ tab : impr_act ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_flow ] . further improvements and refinements",
    "are presumably possible if more elaborate decimations involving more parameters are employed .",
    "clearly , the general state of affairs described here holds independently of the choice of decimation procedure and/or effective action . in this study",
    "we used the multi - representation single - plaquette action .",
    "preliminary data with alternative actions , such as a multiloop fundamental representation action , reveal the same picture as expected .",
    "the use of the demon method for measuring couplings is also immaterial .",
    "the alternative schwinger - dyson ( sd ) method could be used . with this latter method , however , one does not have the option of microcanonically evolving the decimated configurations towards equilibration vis - a - vis the effective action , which is very informative and a nice advantage of the demon method .",
    "with sd a necessary test is to compare between : ( a ) the expectations , computed from the decimated configurations , of the operators occurring in the sd equation , which are then used in that equation to obtain the couplings ; and ( b ) the same expectations computed with effective action equilibrium configurations generated at these couplings .",
    "we hope to report results employing these alternative choices elsewhere .",
    "extension of our study to @xmath16 to obtain the analog of the @xmath0 effective action arrived at here would also be worthwhile .",
