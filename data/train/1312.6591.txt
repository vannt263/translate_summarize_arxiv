    "particle stabilized emulsions play an important role in pharmaceutical , food , oil and cosmetic industries  @xcite .",
    "the particles are adsorbed at the interface between two immiscible fluids and as such stabilize the emulsion .",
    "the stability of the emulsions depends on several parameters like particle coverage at the interfaces and the wettability of the particles .",
    "it was found that the particle coverage at the interface is the most important parameter for stabilizing emulsions  @xcite .",
    "the colloidal particles act in a similar way as surfactants . in both cases the free energy of the interface",
    "is reduced .",
    "however , the fluid - fluid interfacial tension is not being modified by particles  @xcite .",
    "several types of particle stabilized emulsions are known including the bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel ( bijel ) and the more widely known pickering emulsion .",
    "the pickering emulsion was discovered in the beginning of the 20^th^ century independently by pickering and ramsden  @xcite .",
    "it consists of discrete particle covered droplets of a fluid immersed in a second fluid .",
    "the bijel was predicted in 2005 by simulations and experimentally realized for the first time in 2007  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two continuous phases .",
    "the choice of control parameters such as particle concentration , particle wettability and ratio between the two fluids determines if a bijel or a pickering emulsion is obtained  @xcite .",
    "there are many kinds of particles / colloid types which can stabilize an emulsion .",
    "i.e. , next to spheres  @xcite , the colloidal particles can also be of more complex nature and include anisotropic shapes  @xcite , magnetic interactions  @xcite , or anisotropic janus style properties  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the particle shape on the stabilization of pickering emulsions was studied experimentally with prolate and oblate ellipsoids , e.g. in ref .  @xcite . as the degree of the particle anisotropy increases , the effective coverage area increases . in this way they are more efficient stabilizers for emulsions than spherical particles .",
    "furthermore , the rheological properties of the emulsion vary with changing aspect ratio because the coverage of the fluid interfaces and the capillary interactions differ .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the adsorption of a single particle at a flat interface is studied in absence of external fields .",
    "the stable configuration for elongated ellipsoids is the orientation parallel to the interface  @xcite .",
    "this state minimizes the free energy of the particle at the interface by reducing the interfacial area  @xcite .",
    "if the particle shape is more complex like e.g. the super - ellipsoidal hematite particle  @xcite , several equilibrium orientations are possible .",
    "furthermore , if particles are adsorbed at an interface they generally deform the interface .",
    "this deformation can be caused for example by particle anisotropy  @xcite , external forces such as gravity or electromagnetic forces acting on the particles  @xcite , or non - constant interface curvature  @xcite .",
    "this deformation leads to capillary interactions between the particles . in case of ellipsoids at a flat interface",
    "it is a quadrupolar potential  @xcite , which leads to spatial ordering  @xcite .",
    "in general , particle stabilized emulsions are thermodynamically unstable and just kinetically stable .",
    "the energetic penalty for creating the interface is much higher than the entropic increase .",
    "while thermodynamic stability for emulsions has been reported in some special cases , one can generally assume that this requires the interplay of several effects such as particle interactions due to charges , amphiphilic interactions ( janus particles ) or additional degrees of freedom  @xcite .    due to the short timescales and limited optical accessibility , the dynamics of the formation of emulsions",
    "has only found limited attendance so far  @xcite .",
    "the focus of the current article is to study the influence of the geometrical anisotropy and rotational degrees of freedom of ellipsoidal particles on the time development of fluid domain sizes in particle - stabilized emulsions . to obtain a deeper understanding of the individual contributions to the stabilization and formation process due to the particles we investigate model systems involving either a single particle or particle ensembles at a simple interface .",
    "we will demonstrate that the rotational degrees of freedom of ellipsoids can have an impact on the domain growth and might be a suitable way to generate particle stabilized emulsions with exceptional long - term stability .",
    "this article is organized as follows : the simulation method is introduced in section ii .",
    "dynamic emulsion properties are studied in section iii .",

[ ltvglkugelpeubijel ] .",
    "we can identify three regimes : in the first few hundred timesteps the initial formation of the droplets / domains starts .",
    "then , the growth of droplets / domains is being driven by ostwald ripening . at even later times , droplets / domains grow due to coalescence . when two droplets unify ,",
    "the area coverage fraction of the particles at the interface is increased because the surface area of the new droplet is smaller than that of the two smaller droplets before . at some point",
    "the area coverage fraction of the particles is sufficiently high to prevent further coalescence .",
    "the state which is reached at that time is ( at least kinetically ) stabilized and one obtains a stable emulsion .",
    "the values for @xmath100 are larger for bijels than for pickering emulsions .",
    "this can be explained by the way we calculate @xmath100 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) and related text ) using a fourier transformation of the order parameter field .",
    "it can clearly be seen that anisotropic particles are more efficient in interface stabilization than spheres since they can cover larger interfacial areas leading to smaller fluid domains ( note that the simulation volume is kept constant )",
    ". however , the difference in @xmath100 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 is small .",
    "this can be understood as follows : if a neutrally wetting prolate ellipsoid is adsorbed at a flat interface , it occupies an area @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the occupied interface area for a sphere with the same volume .",
    "this corresponds in the case of @xmath117 to the occupied interface being larger by a factor of @xmath121 as compared to spheres . for an oblate ellipsoid",
    "the occupied interface area is @xmath122 which for @xmath118 is by a factor of @xmath123 larger than the area occupied by spheres . since in emulsions",
    "the interfaces are generally not flat , these formulae can only provide a qualitative explanation of the behavior of @xmath100 : if the interface curvature is not neglectable anymore , we loose some of the efficiency of interface stabilization , which is more pronounced for @xmath124 .",
    "this explains why the value of @xmath100 for @xmath118 is only slightly smaller than for @xmath117 .",
    "it seems that @xmath100 reaches a steady state after some @xmath114 timesteps for both types of emulsions and for all three values of @xmath37 .",
    "however , if one zooms in one can observe that @xmath100 develops for a longer time period if the particles have a non - spherical shape .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , the reason for this phenomenon is the additional rotational degrees of freedom due to the particle anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the time development of @xmath100 for emulsions stabilized by prolate particles requires more time than that for the oblate ones .",
    "if a particle changes its orientation as compared to the interface or a neighboring particle this generally changes the interface shape . in this way the domain sizes",
    "are influenced , leading to changes of @xmath100  an effect which is not observed for @xmath85 .     for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "the kink in fig .",
    "[ dsft_zoom_pe ] after about 2.8 million timesteps is due to the coalescence of two droplets of the pickering emulsion .",
    "a substantial difference is the range of the decay . it is larger for the bijel since it consists of a single large interface whereas the pickering emulsion consists of many small interfaces .",
    "the large interface in the bijel is much more deformable .",
    "this explains the larger range of the decay of @xmath100 for the bijel .",

    "furthermore , the range of the decay is larger for @xmath84 than for @xmath86 .",
    "the time of reordering is much shorter for @xmath86 as compared to @xmath84 .",
    "these effects can be explained by the presence of additional rotational degrees of freedom for the anisotropic particles .",
    "while oblate particles have only a single additional rotational degree of freedom as compared to spheres , prolate particles show an even more complex behavior due to their second additional rotational degree of freedom .    in this section we demonstrated that particle anisotropy causes additional timescales to influence the growth of domains in particle - stabilized emulsions . in the following sections we discuss model systems in order to obtain a deeper understanding of this effect .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to prolate particles with @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the high resolution of the particles in the current section was only chosen to be able to sufficiently resolve the oblate objects . in order to reduce the required computational resources , we use smaller particles in the model systems studied below ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) .",
