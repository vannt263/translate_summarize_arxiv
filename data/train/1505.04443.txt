    "it has been more than fifteen years since the universe was found in accelerating expansion  @xcite . however , it is fair to say that its origin is still not yet clear . a possible explanation of this cosmic acceleration is provided by the introduction of a fluid with negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the simplest dark energy candidate is the cosmological constant @xmath2 with the equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "the tiny cosmological constant together with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) ( called the @xmath2cdm model ) turned out to be the standard model which fits the current observational data sets consistently . in spite of this success , however , it is faced with the fine - tuning problem  @xcite and the coincidence problem .",
    "the former arises from the fact that the present - time observed value for the vacuum energy density is more than 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate from quantum field theory .",
    "the later is the question why we live in such a special moment that the densities of dark energy and dark matter are of the same order .",
    "many attempts have been made to tackle those issues , including introducing  dynamical \" dark energy or modifying general relativity at the cosmic scales .",
    "in particular , to alleviate the coincidence problem , an interaction between dark energy and dark matter has been considered extensively in the literature , for example , in  @xcite and references therein . however , usually the interaction form has to be assumed .",
    "the assumed form will lead to a bias when observational data are used to give the constraint on the interaction . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigated the possible interaction in a way independent of specific interacting forms by dividing the whole range of redshift into a few bins and setting the interacting term to be a constant in each redshift bin .",
    "it was found that the interaction is likely to cross the noninteracting line and has an oscillation behavior .",
    "recently , salvatelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the null interaction is excluded at @xmath8 confidence level ( c.l . ) when they added the redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) data to the planck data for the decaying vacuum energy model ( a class of interaction of dark sectors ) .",
    "they parametrized the interaction term to be of the form @xmath9 and also subdivided the redshift into four bins with @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have reconstructed the temporal evolution of the coupling strength between dark matter and vacuum energy , @xmath11 in a nonparametric bayesian approach using the combined observational data sets from the cosmic microwave background radiation , supernovae and large scale structure .",
    "it was found that an evolving interaction can remove some of the tensions between different types of data sets , and is favored at @xmath12 c.l . if the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements of the boss lyman-@xmath13 forest sample are included .",
    "thus , it is quite interesting to see whether there exists some signature of the interaction from the observational data in a model - independent way .    in this paper",
    "we present a nonparametric approach to reconstruct the interaction term between dark energy and dark matter directly from the observational data using gaussian processes ( gp ) .",
    "gp is a model independent method to smooth the data .",
    "we set the nonparameterized interaction term @xmath14 as a function of redshift and reconstruct it from snia union 2.1 data sets .",
    "we will consider three cases , the decaying vacuum energy case with @xmath1 , the @xmath0cdm model and the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization of dark energy , respectively , and pay special attention to the first case as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we give the interacting models of dark energy and dark matter in a flat universe . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we briefly introduce the gaussian processes method and create a mock data set to demonstrate the reliability of the gp reconstruction method . then we apply it to the real data union 2.1 in the decaying vacuum energy case , followed by different values of @xmath0 for comparison and the cpl case .",
    "we give some discussions and make conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in a flat universe with an interaction between dark energy and dark matter , the friedmann equation describing the evolution of the universe is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the energy density of dark matter and @xmath17 the energy density of dark energy .",
    "however , the conservation equations are changed to be @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the equation of state of de , @xmath20 is the expansion rate of the universe , and @xmath21 describes the interaction between dark matter and dark energy . when @xmath22 and @xmath1 , it recovers the standard @xmath2cdm model . unlike most of the ways to parametrize the interaction term @xmath21 using such a form @xmath9  @xcite , here we use @xmath14 itself and want to reconstruct it directly from data using a model - independent method",
    "as assumed in  @xcite , the 4-vector @xmath23 is proportional to the 4-velocity of dark matter .",
    "hence the perturbation of the interaction is not considered in this paper .    combining the friedmann equation and the conservation equations ( @xmath24 throughout the paper ) ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath25(1 + z ) \\nonumber\\\\           & ~~ + 9(1 + w){h^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to redshift @xmath26 .",
    "note that here we also assume @xmath0 is time dependent . for convenience",
    ", we use a dimensionless @xmath27 to characterize the interaction , i.e. , @xmath28 . note that here @xmath27 is not the usual deceleration . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath29(1 + z ) \\nonumber\\\\               & ~~ + 9(1 + w){h^3}. \\label{equa : qh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the luminosity distances at redshift @xmath26 can be expressed as @xmath30 writing @xmath31 as the normalized comoving distance , we can arrive at @xmath32(1 + z ) \\nonumber\\\\           & ~~ + \\frac{{9(1 + w)}}{{d{'^3}}}. \\label{equa : qd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this , we see that using the observed distance - redshift relationship @xmath33 , one can reconstruct the interaction , once the equation of state @xmath0 of dark energy is given .",
    "in order to reconstruct the interaction using current data sets , we should find a model - independent method to reconstruct @xmath33 and its derivatives .",
    "while there are several methods such as principle component analysis  @xcite , gaussian smoothing  @xcite and gaussian processes  @xcite , in this paper we will reconstruct @xmath33 and its derivatives more precisely by using the gp method .",
    "the gaussian processes allows one to reconstruct a function from data without assuming a parametrization for it .",
    "we use gaussian processes in python ( gapp )  @xcite to derive our gp results .",
    "this gp code has been applied in many papers  @xcite .",
    "the distribution over functions provided by gp is suitable to describe the observed data . at each point @xmath26 ,",
    "the reconstructed function @xmath34 is also a gaussian distribution with a mean value and gaussian error . the functions at different points @xmath26 and @xmath35 are related by a covariance function @xmath36 , which only depends on a set of hyperparameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "here @xmath37 gives a measure of the coherence length of the correlation in @xmath39-direction and @xmath38 denotes the overall amplitude of the correlation in the @xmath40-direction .",
    "both of them will be optimized by gp with the observed data set .",
    "in contrast to actual parameters , gp does not specify the form of the reconstructed function .",
    "instead it characterizes the typical changes of the function .",
    "the different choices of the covariance function may affect the reconstruction to some extent .",
    "the covariance function is usually adopted as the squared exponential form  @xcite @xmath41 but it is not always the suitable choice .",
    "here we take the matrn ( @xmath42 ) covariance function @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the analysis made in  @xcite , where they consider various assumed models and many realizations of mock data sets for a test and conclude that the matrn ( @xmath44 ) covariance function can lead to more reliable results than all others when applying gp to reconstructions using @xmath45 measurements .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the detailed technical description of gp can be found , we reconstruct the interaction between dark energy and dark matter using the snia union 2.1 data set  @xcite . before",
    "that we will first show the reliability of the gp method .",
    "+          +          +          +   +   +      to demonstrate the ability of the gp method to distinguish different models and recover the correct behaviors of the models , we create mock data sets of future snia according to the dark energy survey ( des )  @xcite for two fiducial models : the standard @xmath2cdm model and a toy decaying vacuum model : @xmath46 with @xmath1 .",
    "here we set @xmath47 for both .    for the @xmath2cdm model , it is straightforward to calculate the hubble parameter @xmath48 and then obtain the simulated data of @xmath33 easily . because there is no interaction , we just want to check whether the reconstruction with this simulated data can recover @xmath49 .    as for the decaying vacuum model , on the one hand we should calculate the hubble parameter and on the other hand",
    ", we must get @xmath50 for this fiducial model .",
    "the hubble parameter is simply @xmath51 .",
    "the fiducial interaction is @xmath52 .",
    "the rest of the task is to reconstruct @xmath50 from the hubble parameter , and then test how well the reconstructed @xmath50 agrees with the fiducial one .",
    "if the gp method can recover both of the fiducial models and has the ability to distinguish them , we can demonstrate that gp is a valid method in the reconstruction for our propose . in the following",
    "we will create the mock data sets .",
    "the des is expected to obtain high quality light curves for about 4000 sne ia from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in the next five years . from table",
    "@xmath55 in  @xcite we can calculate the errors of @xmath45 : @xmath56 and the corresponding numbers of sne ia for each redshift bin . at every redshift point @xmath26",
    ", @xmath57 is sampled from the normal distribution @xmath58 where @xmath57 is the simulated data of @xmath33 and @xmath59 is the theoretical value from the fiducial model .",
    "thus we create the mock data sets for these two fiducial model . for each of them",
    "we reconstruct @xmath33 and its derivatives and then apply to the reconstruction of the interaction term @xmath50 .",
    "note that each of the reconstructed @xmath33 and its derivatives at every redshift point is a distribution with a mean value and the error regions .",
    "however , @xmath33 and its derivatives are not independent but correlated by a covariance between them . using the reconstructed @xmath33 and its derivatives also the covariance matrix between them",
    ", we can apply monte carlo sampling to determine the @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ equa : qd ] ) for a given @xmath0 at each point @xmath26 which we want to reconstruct .",
    "the detailed description of the covariance matrix can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : mockdlcdm ] that the @xmath33 and its derivatives are reconstructed very well from the mock data sets assuming the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the dashed blue line is the mean of the reconstruction and the shaded blue regions are the @xmath60 and @xmath6 c.l . of the reconstruction .",
    "the errors for higher derivative of @xmath33 are a litter larger than the lower ones .",
    "as expected , at higher redshifts the errors become large due to the poor quality data in that region .    since our reconstruction involves @xmath61 whose errors are even lager in the higher redshift , and will definitely lead to somehow uncontrollable large errors in high redshift regions when apply it to the monte carlo sampling in eq .",
    "( [ equa : qd ] ) . for a better show",
    ", we introduce a prefactor @xmath62 to @xmath50 , that is , @xmath63 .",
    "the choice of @xmath64 is somehow arbitrary , we take @xmath65 here .",
    "the motivation to introduce the prefactor is comprehensible : we just focus on the interaction in the low and medium redshift range because the quality of observed data in the higher redshift range is so poor that it gives a weak constraint on the reconstructed interaction .",
    "such a pre - factor is just considered as a scale transformation with respect to redshift , which does not influence the reconstruction of @xmath50 in the low and medium redshift ranges significantly and provides a better show in the higher redshift range . moreover ,",
    "our aim is to examine the evidence of the interaction , namely , we are testing the equality of the quantity with zero . as a consequence ,",
    "we are free to do this without loss of generality like what ref .",
    "[ 30 ] has done for the null test of the @xmath2cdm model . in the rest of this paper , we use @xmath66 as our interaction term to test the interaction and we mainly focus on the low and medium redshift ranges because of the poor quality of the observed data in high redshift ranges which will not give a good constraint for the interaction term .",
    "figure  [ fig : mockqlcdm ] shows that the reconstructed interaction @xmath67 is consistent with the fiducial @xmath2cdm model nicely , falling in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "the reconstruction in the redshift range from 0 to 0.6 is better than that in the high redshift where the error is large .",
    "further , we see from figs  [ fig : mockddecay ] and  [ fig : mockqdecay ] that the reconstructions of the decaying vacuum model also recover the fiducial model very well , and obviously deviate from the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "this shows that the gaussian processes can capture both the two models very well and correctly distinguish between them .",
    "we now apply the gp method to the real data , union 2.1 data sets  @xcite , which contains 580 sneia data .",
    "let us consider @xmath69 - 25=5\\log\\left[(1+z)d\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath70 km/(s mpc ) , following  @xcite .",
    "actually our results are not sensitive to the values of @xmath71 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 depend on both @xmath71 and the absolute magnitude @xmath72 .",
    "we can fix the @xmath71 and only consider the uncertainties in @xmath72 as adopted in ref .",
    "we transform the distance modulus @xmath73 given in the data set to @xmath45 and set the theoretical initial conditions @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "first , let us consider the decaying vacuum energy case with @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dunion2.1 ] shows the reconstructed @xmath33 and its derivatives from union 2.1 data .",
    "the error is a little larger than that for the reconstruction of the des survey due to the smaller number of sne ia and larger measurement errors .",
    "the reconstruction of the interaction @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qunion2.1 ] .",
    "we see that both the distance @xmath33 and interaction @xmath67 are consistent with the @xmath2cdm model , which implies that there is no evidence for the existence of the interaction .",
    "we now change the equation of state @xmath0 to see how much the differences of @xmath0 will influence the output of our reconstruction .",
    "we consider the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath76 from the planck 2015  @xcite , the cpl parametrization @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 from hst cluster supernova survey 2011  @xcite and other constant equation of state : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , for a comparison .",
    "all of the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : qofotherw ] . here",
    "we emphasize that we have considered the effects of the errors of @xmath0 on the reconstructed @xmath67 in the cases of ( d ) and ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : qofotherw ] .",
    "since the constant @xmath0 for the @xmath0cdm model from planck 2015 is very close to @xmath5 , so the reconstruction is almost the same as the @xmath1 case . while for the cpl case , the error of the reconstruction is a little larger than those in other cases because of the poor constraints on @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we see that if @xmath0 lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath86 is captured within the @xmath6 confidence region of the reconstruction , while the interaction is shown up if the equation of state for dark energy deviates significantly from @xmath5 .",
    "this shows the fact that there is a degeneracy between the interaction and the equation of state of dark energy , as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ equa : qd ] ) .",
    "we have presented an approach to reconstruct the interaction between dark energy and dark matter by using gaussian processes . to check the reliability of the gp method",
    ", we create mock data for two fiducial models , one is the @xmath2cdm model which has no interaction between dark matter and dark energy , the other is a toy decaying vacuum energy model with @xmath46 , which is of the interaction .",
    "it shows that the reconstruction method by using the gaussian process works well and can capture the features of these two models .",
    "we then applied the method to the real data from union 2.1 data sets and reconstructed the distance and its derivatives , and then the interaction .",
    "it was found that for the decaying vacuum energy model with @xmath1  @xcite , there is no evidence for the existence of the interaction , namely , the @xmath2cdm model is consistent with the union 2.1 data sets within @xmath68 limits .    to check the influence of the equation of state of dark energy on the method , we have also considered several constant values of @xmath0 from @xmath87 to @xmath83 .",
    "the results show that @xmath88 falls in @xmath6 c.l . of the reconstruction if @xmath0 lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath76 from planck 2015 falls in this range and @xmath49 is within the @xmath68 limits .",
    "this also holds for the cpl parametrization case .",
    "however , as we can see from figure [ fig : qofotherw ] , if @xmath0 deviates obviously from @xmath5 , the interaction exists beyond 2@xmath89 c.l .. this reflects the degeneracy between the interaction and the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "note that in our reconstruction method , only the observational data on the expansion history of the universe can be used .",
    "for example , some measurements of hubble parameter can also be combined into the above reconstruction .",
    "it is certainly of interest to develop a reconstruction method for the interaction between dark matter and dark energy , in which some kinetic data of the universe , for example , the growth factor of large scale structure , can be used for this aim .",
    "our paper shows that the existence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy found in  @xcite is mainly due to the data of redshift space distortion .",

    "<S> the reconstructed interaction is consistent with the standard @xmath2cdm model , namely , there is no evidence for the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this also holds for the constant @xmath0 cases from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and for the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization case . </S>",
    "<S> if the equation of state deviates obviously from @xmath5 , the reconstructed interaction exists at @xmath6 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the degeneracy between the interaction and the equation of state of dark energy when they get constraints from the observational data . </S>"
