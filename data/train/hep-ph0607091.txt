    "the solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . given the basis in which the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates , the phenomenon of neutrino mixing can simply be described by a @xmath8 unitary matrix @xmath9 which transforms the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath10 into the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath11 .",
    "we assume massive neutrinos to be majorana particles and parametrize @xmath9 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . a global analysis of current experimental data @xcite yields @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 at the @xmath20 confidence level , but three cp - violating phases of @xmath9 ( i.e. , the dirac phase @xmath21 and the majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are entirely unrestricted . in order to interpret the largeness of two neutrino mixing angles together with the smallness of three neutrino masses , many theoretical and phenomenological models of lepton mass matrices have been proposed in the literature @xcite . among them , the scenarios based on possible flavor symmetries are particularly simple , suggestive and predictive .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our interest on the neutrino mass model proposed recently by friedberg and lee ( fl ) @xcite . the neutrino mass operator in the fl model is simply given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all assumed to be _ real_. a salient feature of @xmath29 is its partial gauge - like symmetry ; i.e. , its @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms are invariant under the transformation @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) with @xmath32 being a space - time independent constant element of the grassmann algebra @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) means that the neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 takes the form @xmath33 diagonalizing @xmath0 by the transformation @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) stand for the neutrino masses , one may obtain the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this interesting result leads us to the following observations :    * if @xmath40 holds , @xmath41 will reproduce the exact tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern ( with @xmath42 or @xmath43 , @xmath2 and @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter , which can be understood as a geometric representation of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , is in good agreement with current experimental data .",
    "non - vanishing but small @xmath38 predicts @xmath45 , implying @xmath46 for @xmath19 . on the other hand",

    "the limit @xmath49 results from @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 holds , it is easy to check that the neutrino mass operator @xmath29 has the exact @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath29 is invariant under the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath6 indices ) .",
    "in other words , the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing is a natural consequence of the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry of @xmath0 in the fl model",
    ". then @xmath3 and @xmath52 measure the strength of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking , as many authors have discussed in other neutrino mass models @xcite .",
    "in addition , one may consider to remove one degree of freedom from @xmath29 or @xmath0 ( for instance , by setting @xmath53 @xcite ) .",
    "we aim to generalize the fl model to accommodate cp and t violation for massive majorana neutrinos . into eq .",
    "( 2 ) by replacing the term @xmath54 with the term @xmath55 .",
    "the resultant neutrino mass matrix is no longer symmetric , hence it definitely describes dirac neutrinos instead of majorana neutrinos . ] the effective majorana neutrino mass term can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( for @xmath31 ) , and @xmath0 is of the same form as that given in eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "now the parameters of @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are all complex .",
    "then we are able to derive both the dirac phase ( @xmath21 ) and the majorana phases ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) for the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath9 .",
    "two special cases are particularly interesting :    * scenario ( a ) : @xmath25 and @xmath28 are real , and @xmath58 are complex .",
    "we find that the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry of @xmath0 is softly broken in this case , leading to the elegant predictions @xmath3 , @xmath59 and @xmath4 .",
    "two majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 keep vanishing . * scenario ( b ) : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real , but @xmath28 is complex .",
    "we find that the results of @xmath60 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 obtained from @xmath61 keep unchanged in this case , but some nontrivial values of the majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 can now be generated .",

    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "more detailed discussions about scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) will be presented in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to a generic analysis of the generalized fl model with no special assumptions .",

    "( 10 ) and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is the introduction of a special cp - violating phase ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion about the maximal leptonic cp violation with @xmath4 ) . this cp - violating phase , which is attributed to the soft breaking of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry , can change the prediction of @xmath61 for @xmath47 . comparing eq .",

    "it is possible to measure @xmath80 in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",

    "furthermore , @xmath92 approximately holds in the @xmath91 limit , implying that the maximal value of @xmath25 is roughly half of @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) when three neutrino masses develop a strong normal hierarchy .      in this simple scenario , only @xmath28",

    "of course , both the normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath112 ) and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath113 ) are expected in this generic case .",
    "we shall not carry out a numerical analysis of the parameter space , however , just because it involves a lot of uncertainties and is not as suggestive as that in scenario ( a ) or scenario ( b ) .",

    "another straightforward consequence of the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking is cp violation . assuming the majorana nature of massive neutrinos",
    ", we have generalized the fl model to introduce the cp - violating effects .",
    "in addition to a generic analysis of the generalized fl model , two simple but intriguing scenarios have been proposed : scenario ( a ) involves the softly - broken @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry , leading to the elegant predictions @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath65 and vanishing majorana phases of cp violation ; scenario ( b ) predicts @xmath3 , @xmath52 , @xmath7 and two nontrivial majorana phases of cp violation , on the other hand .",
    "both scenarios are compatible with current experimental data .",
    "although our discussions about the generalized fl model are restricted to low - energy scales , it can certainly be extended to a superhigh - energy scale ( e.g. , the gut scale or the seesaw scale ) . in this case",
    ", one should take into account the radiative corrections to both neutrino masses and flavor mixing parameters when they run from the high scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "a particularly interesting point is that the majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 can radiatively be generated from the dirac phase @xmath21 in scenario ( a ) , while the dirac phase @xmath21 can radiatively be generated from the majorana phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 in scenario ( b ) @xcite .",
    "thus the features of leptonic cp violation can fully show up in both scenarios at low - energy scales , if they are originally prescribed at a superhigh - energy scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis of the running behaviors of cp - violating phases in the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern , including the minimal supergravity threshold effects ) .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry and its slight breaking are useful and suggestive for model building .",
    "we expect that a stringent test of the generalized fl model , in particular its two simple and instructive scenarios , can be achieved in the near future from the reactor neutrino oscillation experiments ( towards measuring @xmath48 ) , the accelerator long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ( towards detecting both @xmath48 and @xmath21 ) and the neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments ( towards probing the majorana nature of massive neutrinos and constraining their majorana phases of cp violation ) .              for recent reviews with extensive references , see : h. fritzsch and z.z .",
