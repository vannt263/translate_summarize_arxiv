    "<S> moreover , the nuclei can be treated as point - like particles .    </S>",
    "<S> such a system of electrons and nuclei constitutes cores of white dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> up to a factor of a few , these are roughly earth s size solar - mass objects ; their central mass density may range over @xmath2 , most of them being near the lower edge of this interval . since the dwarf stars exhausted thermonuclear fuel in their cores already , they evolve by cooling @xcite ; the ones that we consider in this work cool from @xmath3 down to lower temperatures .    at temperatures of interest </S>",

    "<S> the electron properties are universal throughout all the dwarf stars ; their number density may range in the interval @xmath4 , and at temperatures of interest they form a degenerate quantum gas ( their fermi energy is greater that their interparticle coulomb interaction energy ) .    as to the nuclei </S>",
    "<S>  since they re heavier and their de broglie wavelengths are shorter  they may exhibit different properties depending on the values of density and temperature at hand : they may crystallize @xcite as it should be the case for a majority of dwarf stars , or alternatively , may form a quantum liquid @xcite , when densities are high enough . identification and qualitative description of quantum liquid signatures in the cores of high - density cool white dwarf stars </S>",
    "<S> is a main subject of the present work .    as a typical dwarf star cools down </S>",
    "<S> , the coulomb interaction energy in a classical plasma of charged nuclei will significantly exceed their classical thermal energy , and the nuclei , in order to minimize energy , would organize themselves into a crystal lattice @xcite . in most of these cases quantum effects of the nuclei should be negligible ; for instance , the debye temperature should be less than the temperature at which crystallization takes place , and the de broglie wavelengths of the nuclei should be much smaller than the average internuclear separations . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed is the case in majority of white dwarf stars , the cores of which are composed of carbon and/or oxygen nuclei and span the interval of mass densities around @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> .    however , there exists a class of dwarf stars in which the nuclei enter the quantum regime before the above - described classical crystallization process sets in @xcite . among these , furthermore , there is a relatively small subclass of the dwarf stars for which the temperature @xmath6 , at which the de broglie wavelengths of the nuclei begin to overlap , is higher than the would - be crystallization temperature @xmath7 ( see @xcite and discussions in section 2 below ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , right below @xmath6 , the quantum - mechanical uncertainty in the position of the charged nuclei is greater that the average inter - nuclear separation . </S>",
    "<S> this is diametrically opposite to the crystallized state where the nuclei would have well - localized positions with slight quantum - mechanical fuzziness due to their zero - point oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> what is then an adequate description of such a state ? </S>",
    "<S> it was argued in @xcite that such a system , instead of forming a crystalline lattice at @xmath7 , could condense at @xmath8 , owing to the quantum - mechanical probabilistic `` attraction '' of bose particles to occupy one and the same zero - momentum state , and leading to a quantum liquid in which the charged spin-0 nuclei would form a macroscopic quantum state with a large occupation number  the charged condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed in @xcite that the conditions in certain high - density helium - core white dwarfs ( he wds ) are appropriate to form such charged condensate . here </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that similar effects could take place in lower - density he wds , which are more relevant for observations @xcite , as well as in superdense ( @xmath9 ) carbon - core white dwarfs ( c wds ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the observational consequences of the charged condensate in astrophysical objects can be significant . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic part of the liquid is superconducting as its spectrum of long - wavelength fluctuations exhibits a mas gap ; hence these quasi - particles contribute to the specific heat of the substance only in an exponentially suppressed way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this affects the cooling rate for dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will show that the he wds with the condensed cores would cool much faster than the ones in which condensation does not take place .    </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize though that a careful consideration of white dwarf cooling rates requires detailed account of composition and dynamics of their envelopes , which is a complex and less certainly known subject ( for detailed discussions see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will not attempt here to enter these studies . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we consider an over - simplified model just to emphasize our main point that if the charged condensation takes place in the cores of white dwarfs , they ll necessarily cool faster , and there will be a drop - off in their luminosity function .    </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder whether the effects that we re discussing can be entirely obfuscated by the uncertainties in the envelope composition . </S>",
    "<S> although this may well be the case for cooling times , there is nevertheless a model independent prediction of the charged condensation : the luminosity function will have a sharp drop - off after the condensation , with subsequent growth governed by a shallower slope .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite 24 helium - core dwarf candidates in ngc 6397 exhibit a termination of the sequence at low luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to attribute this to the drop - off due to the charged condensation . </S>",
    "<S> whether this proposal can withstand more detailed scrutiny remains to be seen .    </S>",
    "<S> the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we give qualitative arguments why condensation may be preferred over crystallization in certain wds . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we summarize and further develop the effective field theory approach of @xcite to charged condensation , and describe the spectrum that is relevant for cooling of wds . in section 4 </S>",

    "<S> condensation versus crystallization *    0.3 cm    we concentrate on wds that below certain temperature cool by releasing stored in them heat from their surface . at the beginning of that stage </S>",
    "<S> the ions ( nuclei ) form a classical bose gas that cools with constant specific heat ( the so - called mestel cooling @xcite ) down to some temperature @xmath10 , at which coulomb repulsion starts to dominate by about two orders of magnitude over the average thermal energy , and the core undergoes crystallization transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallization temperature in the classical regime is quantified by the ratio = , [ gamma ] where @xmath11 is the electric charge , @xmath12 is the charge of a nucleus , @xmath13 denotes the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 is the electron number - density , @xmath15 is the average inter - ion separation , while @xmath16 denotes the core temperature of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the ion plasma is expected to undergo crystallization once the temperature drops to a value for which @xmath17 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above arguments are entirely _ classical_. the temperature scale that determines the classical versus quantum nature of the crystallization transition is the debye temperature @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the plasma frequency of the ion gas , @xmath20 denotes the ion number density and @xmath21 denotes the mass of a single ion ( the subscript @xmath22 stands for `` heavy '' ) . up to a factor of @xmath23 , @xmath19 coincides with the frequency of zero - point oscillations of the ions in crystal sites , @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the white dwarfs with @xmath25 cool according to the above - described classical scenario . </S>",
    "<S> often however , @xmath26 may significantly exceed @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , quantum zero - point oscillations should be taken into account in order to derive the crystallization temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to delay the formation of quantum crystal , lowering @xmath10 from its classical value at most by about @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since this is a small change for the estimates that we re after here , we will consider the classical value of @xmath10 to be a good approximation , even in the quantum case , keeping in mind that @xmath10 may overestimate somewhat the crystallization temperature of the substance .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there exists a third and very important temperature scale , relevant for studying the cooling of white dwarf interiors . </S>",
    "<S> it is the `` critical '' temperature @xmath6 , at which the de broglie wavelengths of the ions start to overlap @xmath28 below @xmath6 quantum - mechanical uncertainties in the ion positions become greater than an average inter - ion separation . </S>",
    "<S> hence the latter concept looses its meaning as a microscopic characteristic of the system , and the ions enter a quantum - mechanical regime of indistinguishability , where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath6 as the temperature at which @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this differs by a numerical factor from the standard definition of the _ thermal _ de broglie wavelength , @xmath31 , that appears as a natural scale in the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> see comments on the rationale for our choice of @xmath6 below . ] . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath6 the wavefunction of the many - body system of spin-0 ions should be symmetrized , and this would unavoidably lead to probabilistic `` attraction '' of the bosons to occupy the same quantum state .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when crystallization temperature @xmath10 is lower than @xmath6 , the system may instead undergo condensation into a macroscopic zero - momentum quantum state with large occupation number  the charged condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> once in the condensate , the boson positions are entirely uncertain while their momenta equal to zero . in order for such a system to crystallize later on , </S>",
    "<S> each of the bosons should acquire the momentum determined by the zero - point energy of the crystal ions , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is greater than the fermi momentum , as well as typical momenta of fermionic quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the fermions will not be able to transmit to the condensed bosons momenta comparable with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the transition to the crystallized state can only happen spontaneously . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition could take place as it would lower the energy of the entire system due to the favorable electrostatic screening . </S>",
    "<S> however , given that the spectrum of bosonic quasiparticles is gapped , the process will be exponentially suppressed at temperatures below the gap scale . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the condensate should not be expected to undergo subsequent crystallization , at least for a long period of time .    </S>",
    "<S> another crucial question is whether the expression for the critical temperature ( [ tc ] ) gives an accurate estimate for the actual condensation temperature @xmath34 at which the phase transition would take place . </S>",
    "<S> if we were to deal with a _ non - interacting _ system of bosons then the known be condensation temperature , @xmath35 , would have been an order of magnitude smaller than what the estimate ( [ tc ] ) suggests . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been known that already _ weak repulsive _ interactions between bosons increase the condensation temperature ; this is consistent with ones expectation that the repulsion makes easier for the condensation in the momentum space to take place ( indeed , the be condensation is a condensation in the momentum space , while the coordinate space wave - functions are entirely delocalized ) see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    in the case of weakly interacting bosons </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the condensation temperature is small since the interactions are weak . in our case , however , interactions between spin-0 nuclei are strong , in a sense of a many - body system , as we are about to argue below </S>",
    "<S> . in this case we would expect @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> since we have no means to evaluate @xmath34 accurately , we use the expression ( [ tc ] ) as a reasonable and physically motivated approximation for the interacting system @xmath37 . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> the criterium that we adopt for the condensation to take place is t_c ( a   few )   t_cryst . </S>",
    "<S> [ crit ]    the charged condensate is somewhat similar , but also differs by its strong coupling , from the bose - einstein condensate of charged spin-0 particles . </S>",
    "<S> analytic studies of a be condensate of charged scalars in the past ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references citing it ) relied on a small departure from the condensation of free particles , and used an expansion in a parameter @xmath38 that is defined as the ratio of the average interparticle separation to the would - be bohr radius for the boson . </S>",
    "<S> for a weakly non - ideal system of bosons the @xmath38-ratio is small @xmath39 , and the ground state is the weakly - non - ideal be condensate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as zero - temperature numerical simulations show ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , for @xmath40 the condensate and crystal state begin to coexist . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for @xmath41 the entirely crystallized state is a ground state . </S>",
    "<S> presumably , the finite temperature effects would increase the value of @xmath38 at which the crystallization takes place only by a factor of a few , but not by an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the system of nuclei and electrons </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38-ratio can not be made small without entering the regime where nuclear interactions become dominant . instead , in the case considered in @xcite , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in the present work we will consider even larger values , @xmath43 , which are relevant for observed he wds . </S>",
    "<S> yet we argue that because the temperature @xmath6 at which the de broglie wavelengths of bosons start to overlap is greater than the crystallization temperature , the system , upon gradual cooling , should settle in the charged condensate state due to the quantum - mechanical probabilistic properties of the indistinguishable bosons . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our criterium @xmath8 implies that the charged condensation could take place at fine temperature @xmath6 for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth pointing out in this regard that the expansion parameter in our case ends up being @xmath45 , as long as the system is described in an effective lagrangian approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the seeming contradiction with the numerical results may be reconciled by the fact that the charged condensate can only be a metastable state @xcite , while the crystal should arguably be the lowest energy state for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the numerical simulations use the test wavefunction approach that minimizes the energy ; finding a long - lived state which represents only a local minimum may not be easy in this approach . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to speculate whether this is the branch that we re discussing here . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> one check of this proposal is that the small fluctuations of the charged condensate have no unstable modes , suggesting that it represents at least a local minimum . also , these fluctuations are rather different from those of a would - be crystal , ordinary clod plasma , or weakly - coupled be condensate . for discussions of non - perturbative ( meta)stability of the charged condensate in a different context , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite .    * </S>",
    "<S> 3 . charged condensate and its fluctuations *    0.3 cm    we use an effective lagrangian description to study the charged condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the zero - temperature limit , even though realistic temperatures in he wds are well above zero ( for calculations of the finite temperature effects , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the zero - temperature approximation is justified _ a posteriori _ and goes as follows : the spin-0 nuclei undergo the condensation to the zero - momentum state ; while they do so they can not excite their own phonons since the latter are gapped with the magnitude of the gap being greater than the condensation temperature . on the other hand , the condensing charged bosons can and will excite thermal fluctuations in the fermionic sector that is gap - less . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all the thermal fluctuations will end up being stored in the fermionic quasiparticles near the fermi surface . for the later , however , the finite temperature effects are nt significant since their fermi energy is so much higher , @xmath47 .    after these comments we turn to the effective lagrangian . by @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> we denote the mass of a ( heavy ) nucleus of charge @xmath12 and atomic number @xmath48 ( helium-4 , carbon , oxygen ) , by @xmath49 the electron chemical potential , and by @xmath50 the electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> the following hierarchy of scales , @xmath51 $ ] , is a starting point for the effective lagrangian construction .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin at scales that are well below the heavy mass scale @xmath21 , but somewhat above the scale set by @xmath52 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence the electrons are described by their dirac lagrangian , while for the description of the nuclei we will use a charged scalar _ order parameter _ @xmath53 . as it was shown in @xcite , in a non - relativistic approximation for the nuclei , an effective lagrangian proposed by greiter , wilczek and witten ( gww ) @xcite in a context of superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> is also applicable for the description of the charged condensation , given that an appropriate reinterpretation of its variables and parameters is made .    </S>",
    "<S> the construction of the gww effective lagrangian is based on the following fundamental principles : it is consistent with the translational , rotational , galilean and the global @xmath54 symmetries , preserves the algebraic relation between the charged current density and momentum density , gives the schrdinger equation for the order parameter in the lowest order , and is gauge invariant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the electron dynamics the gww effective lagrangian reads ( we omit for simplicity the standard maxwell term ) : _ eff = p ( i2 ( ^ * d_0 - ( d_0 ) ^ * ) - | d_j |^2 2m_h ) + |(i^d^f_-m_f ) , [ leff ] where we use the standard notations for covariant derivatives with the appropriate charge assignments : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , while @xmath58 stands for a general polynomial function of its argument . , @xmath59 , and the higher dimensional operators that are consistent with all the symmetries and conditions that lead to ( [ leff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath60 denotes a non - relativistic chemical potential for the scalars . </S>",
    "<S> these terms will not be important for the low - temperature spectrum of small perturbations we re interested in , as long as @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> however , near the phase transition point it is the sign of @xmath60 that would distinguish between the broken and symmetric phases , so these terms should be included for the discussion of the symmetry restoration . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the scalar part of ( [ leff ] ) is somewhat similar to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) lagrangian for superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a significant difference between the two . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length in the gl theory is many orders of magnitude greater than the average interelectron separation , while in the present case , the `` size of the scalar '' @xmath63 is smaller that the average interparticle distance . ]    the coefficients of this polynomial , @xmath64 , are dimensionful numbers that are inversely proportional to powers of a short - distance cutoff of the effective field theory .    once the basic lagrangian is fixed , we introduce the electron chemical potential term @xmath65 , where @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a nonzero electron number density @xmath14 which is related to the fermi momentum @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the only term that at the tree level sets a frame in which the electron total momentum is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum loop corrections due to this term will generate additional lorentz - violating terms in the bosonic sector of the theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists a solution of the equations of motion that follow from the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this solution takes the form @xcite : z||^2 = j_0 ,   a_=0 ,  p^(0)=1 . </S>",
    "<S> [ sol ] ( we use the unitary gauge @xmath68 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath69 is satisfied by any polynomial functions @xmath70 for which the first coefficient is normalized to unity ( x ) = x + c_2 x^2 + .... [ px ] the above solution describes a neutral system of negatively charged electrons of charge density @xmath71 , and positively charged scalar ( helium-4 nuclei ) condensate of charge density @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this describes the condensate and not a standard crystal in a long wavelength approximation where lattice inhomogeneities can be neglected , or ordinary cold plasma . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes more clear after one calculates the spectrum of small perturbations about the homogeneous solution and finds that it is rather different from the spectra of nearly free be condensate , crystal lattice vibrations , or from plasma fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> calculation of the spectrum of small perturbations is straightforward ( here we follow conventions of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two transverse polarizations of a massive photon which propagate with the conventional massive dispersion relation ^2 = ^2 + m_^2 ,  m_^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ magnetic ] moreover , there is one longitudinal mode ( phonon ) with the following unconventional dispersion relation ^2 m_^2m_^2 + ^4 4m_h^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ electric ] here @xmath73 , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the debye mass squared . as we see , @xmath76 , and the bosonic collective excitations are gapped . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the bosonic part of the whole system represents a superconducting component , while the fermions , at temperatures of interest , can be regarded as the `` normal '' ( dissipative ) component of the quantum liquid ( see more below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that in the approximation used above there does not appear to be a @xmath77 term on the r.h.s . of the dispersion relation ( [ electric ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a term emerges ( see @xcite ) in the @xmath78 order of the heavy mass expansion , and is proportional to @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this term is responsible for the `` roton - like '' behavior of small fluctuations discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation ( [ electric ] ) is applicable for @xmath80 , which corresponds to distances shorter than @xmath81  the scale that encompasses a huge number of particles .    </S>",
    "<S> note also that the phonon dispersion relation ( [ electric ] ) is different from that of a conventional phonon in a crystal for which @xmath82 , near the origin . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the substance that we re discussing is different from a crystal , and it is also different from classical plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the following line of arguments also suggests that the charged condensate differs from the ordinary be condensate of nearly - free bosons too : in the limit of switched off interactions , @xmath83 , the dispersion relation ( [ electric ] ) reduces to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this is nothing but a dispersion relation for a lowest excitation in a be condensate of _ free _ bosons of mass @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for realistic values of the parameters the second ( momentum dependent ) term in ( [ electric ] ) is sub - dominant , suggesting that the charged condensate has a significant departure from the be condensate of nearly - free bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> what is important for the present work is that the bosonic collective excitations give rise to exponentially suppressed contributions to the value of specific heat of this substance . </S>",
    "<S> typical suppression scales as @xmath85 , and since for the he wds @xmath86 , at temperatures below @xmath87 , these contributions are proportional to @xmath88 and can be neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case in dwarf starts in which the nuclei formed a crystalline structure . </S>",
    "<S> there , the dominant contribution to the specific heat comes from a crystal phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has a linear dispersion relation @xmath82 , and its contribution to the specific heat scales with temperature as @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to a good approximation , there is no phonon contribution in the charged condensate case , while it is present when the cores crystallize .    as to the electrons , </S>",
    "<S> their behavior is similar in both crystal and condensate cases . at temperatures of interest they form a degenerate fermi gas with gap - less excitations near the fermi surface . </S>",

    "<S> after the condensation , specific heat of the system dramatically drops as the collective excitations of the condensed nuclei become massive and `` get extinct '' . </S>",
    "<S> a contribution from the fermi sea , which is strongly suppressed by the value of fermi energy , becomes the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition itself would take some time to complete , and the drop - off in specific heat will not be instantaneous . during that time a heat - transfer from the bosonic sector to the fermionic one will take place , but this will only change temperature of the fermions by a factor of @xmath109 , which , given our approximations , can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> effects of finite duration of the phase transition on the shape of the luminosity function will be discussed in the next section . here , </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we approximate the transition to be instantaneous , and retain only the fermion contribution to specific heat below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the expression for the age of the star for @xmath110 , reads as follows t_he=. [ eq02 ] notice the difference of ( [ eq02 ] ) from ( [ eq03 ] )  in the former @xmath111 and it is @xmath103 that enters as final temperature in the fermionic part , while @xmath6 should be taken as the final temperature in the bosonic part .        </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 gives the ratio of ages , @xmath112 , for two identical helium dwarf stars , with and without the interior condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the considered range of final temperature is @xmath113 . at the upper edge of this interval , the luminosity of the star , depending on the metallicity interval given in ( [ eq01 ] ) , is @xmath114 , while for the lower edge of the temperature interval we get @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> as is seen from this figure , the charged condensation substantially increases the rate of cooling . at the lower end of the considered temperature interval </S>",
    "<S> the age is about twenty times less than it would have been without the condensation phase .    with the decrease of density , the critical and debye temperatures drop as @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively , whereas the crystallization temperature drops only as @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the critical and crystallization temperatures would become equal for the dwarfs of low density . </S>",
    "<S> this would happen for densities @xmath119 , which are very low and unlikely to be present in white dwarfs cores . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we d expect that all he wds should have a large fractions of their cores in the condensed state .    to summarize , the charged condensation of white dwarf interiors would have a significant impact on cooling curves of helium dwarf stars at the faint end of the luminosity spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a certain temperature scale , @xmath120 , the ages of the stars become effectively `` frozen '' , whereas the temperature and luminosity decrease rather fast . such a change in the cooling regime </S>",
    "<S> would leave its signatures on the luminosity function of helium white dwarfs , which we ll discuss below .      </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function ( lf ) @xmath121 can be used to test the white dwarf evolution models against the observational data ; it is defined as follows : ( ) d ( ( ) )  ( ( ) ) . under the assumption of the standard star formation rate , uniform both in space and time </S>",
    "<S> , the luminosity function takes a simple power - law form [ ] ^-1 l^-1 , where the constants @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the exponents defining temperature dependence of specific heat and luminosity : c_vt^k , lt^. for instance , @xmath123 equals to @xmath124 , once the kramer s opacity is adopted for the description of the dwarf atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the log of the lf corresponding to cooling in the mestel regime ( @xmath125 ) , is just a line with a slope equal to @xmath126 .     which is determined by their formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line represents the mestel regime . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the luminosity function near the condensation point depends on the details of the corresponding phase transition . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the condensation of the core would induce significant deviations from the mestel curve for helium white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential suppression of specific heat of the ions in the condensate does nt occur instantaneously . </S>",
    "<S> typically , for a quantum liquid , there is a transition region of width @xmath127 , in which the specific heat changes in a certain way . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , starting from some temperature @xmath128 , at which the specific heat of the ions can be neglected and a stage of rapid cooling begins ( the age of the star `` freezes '' ) , the luminosity function starts to drop dramatically ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . the stars , previously belonging to the same logarithmic luminosity bin , will spread among a few bins as a result of suddenly accelerated cooling .    </S>",
    "<S> not much can be said with certainty of @xmath129 and the temperature dependence of specific heat near the phase transition point . in a well - known case of quantum liquid of neutral helium atoms for instance , </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat exhibits the so - called `` lambda '' behavior . in analogy with the latter </S>",
    "<S> , one may expect the specific head to increase near the phase transition point before dropping dramatically below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the parameter @xmath129 would give the width of the transitional region . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the details of the function @xmath130 near the phase transition point , the luminosity function of he wds could take different shapes near its maximum , as it is schematically illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    what is independent of the above uncertainties , however , is the fact that the lf will experience a significant drop - off after the charged condensation phase transition is complete . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the `` extinction '' of the bosonic quasiparticles below the phase transition point . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the lf function will drop by a factor of @xmath131 , which would be reflected as a drop - off by about two units of the vertical axis from its maximum shown on fig 2 . after the drop - off the log of the lf function starts growing again but now with the slope equal to @xmath132  due to the specific heat of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the latter part of the lf is shown only for one of the curves on fig 2 . </S>",
    "<S> whether this drop - off can explain the termination of the 24 he wd sequence found in @xcite , remains to be seen in more detailed studies .      </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly mention another possible subclass of white dwarf stars , that could undergo the core condensation . </S>",
    "<S> these are superdense dwarfs composed mainly of carbon , with masses close to the chandrasekhar limit @xmath133 , and central densities @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> such a star would be very close to the neutronization threshold ( @xmath135 for carbon nuclear matter ) , and it s critical temperature @xmath136 would be greater than the crystallization temperature @xmath137 , making condensation a possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming the helium dominated envelope ( @xmath138 denotes the helium fraction ) with a @xmath139 metallicity x0,y0.9 , z_m0.1 , we find the cooling time needed to reach down to temperature @xmath140 t_c=310 ^ -3  . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature corresponds to luminosity @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> once the star enters the condensation regime , it cools faster . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it would reach the luminosity @xmath142 in @xmath143 after the condensation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes that this star crystallizes instead of condensing its core , then it would reach the crystallization point in @xmath144 , while it would take only @xmath145 longer for this star to cool down to @xmath142 , as compared with the condensation case . in the crystallized phase for this star the cooling due to the fermion contributions is significant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the log of the lf for such a star would not have a sharp drop - off ; instead , after the phase transition the lf would just change its slope to @xmath132 in the low luminosity region .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that for dwarf stars with relativistically degenerate cores , the polytrope models yield more dramatic density profiles  density in the center exceeds the average density by a factor of @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> since the crystallization / critical temperature equality is achieved at densities @xmath147 for carbon interiors , we should not expect the entire core to condense . </S>",
    "<S> in realistic calculations of cooling rates of the superdense carbon wds this should also be taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic properties of condensed wds , and their similarity to type ii supeconductors , will be discussed in @xcite .    finally , we mention that charged condensation may also take place in some other astrophysical objects where the densities and temperatures are appropriate </S>",
