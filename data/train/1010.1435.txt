    "the aids pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to public health worldwide .",
    "aids has killed an estimated 2.9 million people , with close to 4.3 million people newly infected with hiv in 2006 alone . the total number of people living with hiv has reached its highest level ( who web site ) . although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) regimens are effective in suppressing plasma hiv rna levels ( viral load ) below the limit of detection , many patients may fail haart treatments due to drug resistance , lack of potency , poor drug adherence , pharmacokinetic problems and adverse effects .",
    "in addition , the complexity of regimens and lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis of hiv infection also pose great challenges to aids researchers . over the past 2 decades ,",
    "many mathematicians and statisticians have developed mechanism - based models and statistical approaches to assist in understanding hiv pathogenesis and have made significant contributions in this area [ ho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wei et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "in particular , differential equation models have been widely used in describing dynamics and interactions of hiv and the immune system . some survey on these models",
    "can be found in perelson and nelson ( @xcite ) , nowak and may ( @xcite ) , and tan and wu ( @xcite ) .    for the mechanism - based models of hiv infection ,",
    "one critical question is how to use experimental or clinical data to estimate the parameters in the nonlinear differential equation models which do not have closed - form solutions in most cases .",
    "researchers have made a substantial effort to get an approximate closed - form solution under various assumptions , and then use the standard regression approach to estimate the dynamic parameters in the models [ ho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wei et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wu and ding ( @xcite ) , wu ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "but these approximations and assumptions may not always hold , in particular , for patients undergoing long - term treatment .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following hiv dynamic model for patients under long term treatments [ e.g. , perelson and nelson ( @xcite ) ] : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the concentration of uninfected target cells , @xmath2 the concentration of infected cells , @xmath3 the viral load , @xmath4 the proliferation rate of uninfected target cells , @xmath5 the death rate of uninfected target cells , @xmath6(t ) the time - varying infection rate depending on antiviral drug efficacy , @xmath7 the death rate of infected cells , @xmath8  the clearance rate of free virions , and @xmath9 the number of virions produced by a single infected cell on average . in this system ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are state variables , and @xmath13 are unknown dynamic parameters .",
    "notice that here we do not distinguish the infected cells by various subpopulations such as productively infected cells , latently infected cells and long - lived infected cells [ perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] , since we intend to model the viral dynamics for an hiv - infected patient under long - term treatment .",
    "we also use a time - varying parameter @xmath14 to model the infection rate since the infection rate may change nonparametrically due to the variation in treatment effect over time .",
    "generally speaking , all kinetic parameters in this model could be time - varying [ not only @xmath14 ] ; however , it is usually unfeasible to do so due to the limited data collected in the clinical studies .",
    "thus , this model provides a flexible although simple approach for studying long - term viral dynamics . in clinical trials or clinical practice , viral load , @xmath12 and total cell count , @xmath16 , are closely monitored and measured over time .    in practice",
    ", some parameters can be fixed from previous studies and only the remaining parameters are needed to be estimated . however ,",
    "when such prior knowledge is not available , it is important to estimate all viral dynamic parameters , @xmath17 , for each individual patient from the clinical measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath18 , since the estimated dynamic parameters may be used to guide clinical decisions for individualized treatment . although aids investigators have tried to estimate some of these dynamic parameters based on viral load data [ ho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wei et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] , none of them have successfully estimated all these dynamic parameters directly for an individual patient . huang and wu ( @xcite ) and huang , liu and",
    "wu ( @xcite ) have made an effort to use the bayesian method to estimate all these parameters , but strong priors are required for most parameters in order to make all parameters identifiable . in the work of xia ( @xcite ) , filter , xia and gray ( @xcite ) , gray et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and ouattara , mhawej and moog ( @xcite ) , all model parameters were estimated for hiv dynamic models with only constant coefficients . in this paper , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this effort represents the first attempt to simultaneously estimate all the constant and time - varying hiv viral dynamic parameters for individual patients using both viral load and total cell count data .    in this paper",
    "we propose two estimation approaches .",
    "the first one is a multistage smoothing - based ( mssb ) approach .",
    "we derive the direct relationships between the unknown dynamic parameters and measurement variables from the original differential equation models , and then we employ these relationships to formulate regression models for the unknown parameters .",
    "these regression models involve not only the time function of measurement variables , but also their derivatives .",
    "we propose using a nonparametric smoothing method , such as the local polynomial smoothing , to obtain the measurement variables and their derivatives which are substituted into the regression models to estimate the unknown dynamic parameters ( including the time - varying parameter ) in the second step .",
    "this approach avoids directly solving the odes by numerical methods and is computationally efficient . the second approach that we propose is to use a spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) method .",
    "this approach is to use splines to approximate the time - varying parameter so that the original ode model becomes a model only containing constant parameters .",
    "the standard nls method can be employed to estimate the unknown dynamic parameters and spline coefficients .",
    "this approach needs to use a numerical method to repeatedly solve the nonlinear odes for the high - dimensional nls optimization problem which is computationally challenging .",
    "some cutting - edge computational techniques are necessary to solve this problem .",
    "note that the mssb approach is computationally efficient , but the derived estimates are quite rough ; however , these estimates can be used as the initial values for the snls method so that the two approaches can be efficiently combined for practical applications .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ multi - stage ]",
    "we briefly discuss the identifiability of the hiv dynamic model , then propose the multistage smoothing - based ( mssb ) approach . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) method .",
    "in particular , a hybrid optimization technique combining a gradient method and a global optimization algorithm will be used to tackle the high - dimensional nls optimization problem .",
    "the simulation studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we apply the proposed methods to estimate hiv viral dynamic parameters ( including the time - varying infection rate ) from data for two aids patients in section [ secclinicaldata ] .",
    "we demonstrate that some of these dynamic parameters are estimated from clinical data for the first time .",
    "we conclude the paper with some discussions in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the details of the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm are given in the .",
    "before introducing the estimation methods , it is critical to determine whether all unknown model parameters can be uniquely and reliably identified from a given system input and measurable output . the technique to answer this question is called identifiability analysis .",
    "there are mainly two types of identifiability problems : structural ( mathematical ) identifiability and practical ( statistical ) identifiability .",
    "structural identifiability analysis techniques use model structure information only ( without knowledge of experimental observations ) to determine whether all unknown parameters are uniquely identifiable .",
    "therefore , it is also called the prior identifiability analysis . in contrast , practical identifiability analysis techniques should be applied after model fitting to verify the reliability of estimates , so it is called the posterior identifiability analysis [ rodriguez - fernandez , egea and banga ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "a  thorough discussion and review of identifiability techniques and theories is out of the scope of this study ; for more details , the interested reader is referred to ritt  ( @xcite ) , bellman and strm ( @xcite ) , kolchin ( @xcite ) , pohjanpalo ( @xcite ) , cobelli , lepschy and jacur ( @xcite ) , walter ( @xcite ) , vajda , godfrey and rabitz ( @xcite ) , ollivier ( @xcite ) , chappel and godfrey ( @xcite ) , ljung and glad ( @xcite ) , audoly et al .",

    "we employed the differential algebra approach [ ljung and glad ( @xcite ) ] and it can be easily verified that all constant and time - varying parameters in models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) are structurally identifiable .",
    "parameter estimation for ode models has been investigated using the least squares principle by mathematicians [ hemker ( @xcite ) , bard ( @xcite ) , li , osborne and prvan ( @xcite ) ] , computer scientists [ varah ( @xcite ) ] and chemical engineers [ ogunnaike and ray ( @xcite ) , poyton et al .",

    "chen and wu ( @xcite ) and liang and wu ( @xcite ) proposed a two - step smoothing - based approach to estimate both constant and time - varying parameters in ode models separately .    in this section",
    "we adopt the ideas from liang and wu ( @xcite ) and chen and wu ( @xcite ) to use the smoothing - based approach to estimate all dynamic parameters , including both constant and time - varying parameters , in model  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) in three stages .",
    "stage i is to smooth the noisy data to estimate the state variables and their derivatives ; stage ii is to estimate constant dynamic parameters ( @xmath19 ) ; stage iii is proposed to estimate both constant dynamic parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , and the time - varying parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce these three stages in detail in the following subsections .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly describe how we use the local polynomial regression technique to estimate the functions @xmath18 and @xmath12 and their derivatives .",
    "consider a general situation that a state variable , @xmath20 , is observed at @xmath21 time points , @xmath22 , that is , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are independent measurement errors with mean zero .",
    "assume that the fourth derivative of @xmath26 exists .",
    "for each given time point  @xmath27 , we approximate the function @xmath28 locally by a @xmath29th - order polynomial , @xmath30 , for @xmath31 in a neighborhood of the point  @xmath27 , where @xmath32 for @xmath33 . following the local polynomial fitting [ fan and gijbels ( @xcite ) ] , the estimators @xmath34 of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 in our case )",
    "can be obtained by minimizing the locally weighted least - squares criterion , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a symmetric kernel function , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a proper bandwidth .",
    "let @xmath41 denote @xmath42 as an @xmath43 design matrix whose @xmath44th row is @xmath45 , and @xmath46 an @xmath47 diagonal matrix of kernel weights , that is , @xmath48 .",
    "assuming that the matrix @xmath49 is not singular , a standard weighted least squares theory leads to the solution , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "we use the local linear regression to estimate @xmath20 , the local quadratic regression to estimate @xmath52 , and the local cubic regression to estimate @xmath53 . consequently ,",
    "using the above notation , the estimators @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57 vector having 1 in the @xmath58 entry and zeros in the other entries .",
    "we apply the local polynomial smoothing technique to the viral load data , @xmath12 and total cd4@xmath59 t cell count data , @xmath16 to obtain the estimates of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 that will be used in stage ii , and the estimate of @xmath64 that will also be used in stage iii .      in this subsection",
    "we apply the approach proposed by liang and wu ( @xcite ) to estimate constant dynamic parameters ( @xmath19 ) in models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) .",
    "notice that we can combine equations ( [ 3dmodel : eq1 ] ) and ( [ 3dmodel : eq2 ] ) , and obtain @xmath65=\\lambda- \\rho t_u(t)- \\delta t_i(t).\\ ] ] recalling that @xmath66 and substituting @xmath67 in the above equation , we obtain @xmath68- \\delta t_i(t).\\ ] ] from the above equation , we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 . substituting this expression into equation ( [ 3dmodel : eq3 ] ) and letting @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73",

    "let @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the estimates of @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 from section  [ sect2.1 ] , respectively , and substitute these estimates in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we then obtain a linear regression model [ liang and wu ( @xcite ) ] , @xmath80 where @xmath81 includes all substitution errors . using the least squares regression technique",
    ", we obtain the estimates of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 which are termed as the pseudo - least squares ( psls ) estimates in liang and wu  ( @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , from the above derivation , we have the relationship @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we can obtain the estimates of @xmath8 , @xmath87 and @xmath5 from model ( [ eq : eq4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "write @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 for @xmath91 using the arguments similar to those in liang and wu  ( @xcite ) , we can establish asymptotics for the smoothing - based estimators @xmath92 of  @xmath93 .",
    "the delta - method can then be used for establishment of the asymptotic properties of the estimators for @xmath87 and @xmath5 .",
    "notice that , when the mean of @xmath81 is zero , the least squares estimates of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unbiased .",
    "however , the substitution error @xmath81 in model ( [ eq : eq4 - 1 ] ) is not mean zero , instead its mean is in the order of @xmath94 , and variance is of the order @xmath95 which goes to zero when @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is different from a standard measurement error with mean zero and constant variance .",
    "now we propose how to estimate the remaining constant parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath7 , and the time - varying parameter , @xmath14 . recalling ( [ 3dmodel : eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath97 while from ( [ 3dmodel : eq3 ] ) we can obtain @xmath98 a combination of ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) deduces @xmath99 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } -\\delta\\{v'(t)+cv(t)\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 in which all functions and parameters have been estimated from stages i and ii .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we can formulate a semiparametric time - varying coefficient regression model [ wu and zhang ( @xcite ) ] : @xmath104 where @xmath105 includes all substitution errors .",
    "note that @xmath7 and @xmath106 are constant parameters , while @xmath14 is an unknown time - varying parameter . to fit this model",
    ", we can approximate the time - varying parameter @xmath14 by the local polynomial approach , a  basis spline method or other nonparametric techniques [ wu and zhang ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the basis spline approach is straightforward and simple if the function @xmath14 does not fluctuate dramatically as in our case of hiv dynamic models .",
    "thus , we select to use the b - spline approximation here , that is , @xmath107 where @xmath108 are constant b - spline coefficients , and @xmath109 the basis functions of order @xmath110 . for more details about b - splines such as construction of higher order basis functions via recurrence relations , the reader is referred to de boor ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , model ( [ eq:9 - 1 ] ) can be approximately written as @xmath111 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } + \\sum_{j=1}^{s } \\{b_{j , k } ( t ) u_3(t)\\ } n\\delta a_j+ \\varepsilon ^*(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this becomes a standard linear regression model and we can easily estimate the unknown constant parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath114 from which we can derive the estimates of @xmath115 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that aic , bic or aicc can be used to determine the order of the b - splines in our numerical data analysis .",
    "see detailed discussion on this in the next section .    also notice that wu and ding ( @xcite ) suggested that fitting viral dynamic data to different models for different time periods may result in better estimates of viral dynamic parameters .",
    "for example , we may fit a viral dynamic model with a closed - form solution to the early ( first week ) viral load data to obtain a better estimate of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 as proposed by perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates can then be substituted into the regression models in stages ii and iii to obtain the estimates of other parameters .",
    "we will adopt this alternative strategy in our real data analysis .    in summary",
    ", we are able to use a multistage approach to derive the estimates of all dynamic parameters in an hiv dynamic model .",
    "this approach only involves parametric and nonparametric / semiparametric regressions and",
    "the implementation is straightforward .",
    "the numerical evaluations of odes are avoided and the initial values of the state variables are not required . however , there are two issues that should be addressed for this approach .",
    "first , in this study , we focused on models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) and the three stages were therefore particularly proposed for the specific model .",
    "however , the mssb approach itself is a general method for estimating parameters in ode models ; for general guidelines in use of the mssb approach , the interested reader is referred to liang and wu ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , although the estimators based on the mssb approach have some attractive asymptotic properties , some limitations exist for this approach . in particular , it needs to estimate the derivatives of state variables which are sensitive to measurement noise when the data are sparse .",
    "this may result in biased estimates of parameters and measurement errors . in order to improve the estimates ,",
    "we propose the spline - enhanced least squares approach in the next section .",
    "in this section we introduce a spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) method to refine parameter estimates for models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) .",
    "the basic idea is to approximate the time - varying parameter @xmath14 by the b - spline approach .",
    "then models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) become the standard odes with constant parameters only .",
    "we can use the standard nls approach to estimate the constant dynamic parameters and b - spline coefficients by numerically evaluating the odes repeatedly .",
    "this method is computationally intensive .",
    "li et al . ( @xcite ) used a similar idea to approximate the unknown time - varying parameter in a pharmacokinetic ode model .",
    "different types of splines can be constructed based on different basis functions , such as the well - known piecewise polynomial splines and basis splines .",
    "note that , for an arbitrary spline function of a specific degree and smoothness over a given domain partition , a linear combination of basis splines of the same degree and smoothness over the same partition can always be found to represent this spline function [ de boor  ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "therefore , b - splines can be employed to approximate the time - varying parameter @xmath14 in this study without loss of generality .",
    "similar to the approximation ( [ etabasisspline ] ) in the previous section , @xmath14 can be approximated by a b - spline of order @xmath110 with @xmath116 control points [ de boor ( @xcite ) ] , that is , @xmath117 in addition , it should be noted that once the number and positions of control points are determined , the number and positions of knots are also automatically determined at the knot average sites [ de boor ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "thus , our model equations  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath118 where @xmath119 are unknown constant parameters .",
    "note that we have measurements of total cell counts , @xmath120 , and viral load , @xmath121 , that is , the measurement model can be written as @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are assumed to be mean zero with constant variances and independent .",
    "then the standard nls estimator can be obtained by minimizing the objective function @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the total number of cell measurements and @xmath127 is the total number of viral load observations ; and @xmath128 and @xmath129 are numerical solutions to equations  ( [ 3dmodeletaspline : eq1])([3dmodeletaspline : eq3 ] ) using the runge  kutta method . however ,",
    "if @xmath123 and  @xmath130 are correlated , the weighted ( generalized ) nls method can be used . to stabilize the variance and the computational algorithms , the log - transformation of the data",
    "is usually used in practice .",
    "more generally , the weighted nls approach can be used to more efficiently estimate the unknown parameters if the weights for different terms in the objective function are known .",
    "usually the fisher - information - matrix can be used to obtain the confidence intervals for the unknown parameters , but the bootstrap approach is more precise although it is more computationally intensive [ joshi , seidel - morgenstern and kremling ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "we will use the bootstrap method in our real data analysis .      for the snls approach ,",
    "a critical step is to minimize a multimodal objective function ( [ log10rss ] ) over a  high - dimensional parameter space . in practice , it is challenging to find the global solution to such problems if the parameter space is high - dimensional ( as always the case in many biomedical problems ) , and/or the parameter values are of different orders of magnitude , and/or the objective function is multimodal or even not smooth with noisy data .",
    "thus , it is critical to develop an efficient and stable optimization algorithm .",
    "there are three main categories of optimization methods : direct search methods , gradient methods and global optimization methods .",
    "however , both the direct search methods ( e.g. , the simplex method ) and the gradient methods ( e.g , the levenberg  marquardt method and the gauss  newton method ) can be easily trapped by local minima and even just fail for our problems [ miao et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] . for details and application of such methods in ode models ,",
    "the reader is referred to nocedal and wright ( @xcite ) and englezos and kalogerakis ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the global optimization methods are more suitable for the parameter estimation problem for ode models .",
    "moles , banga and keller ( @xcite ) compared the performance and computational cost of seven global optimization methods , including the differential evolution method [ storn and price ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "their results suggest that the differential evolution method outperforms the other six methods with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "unfortunately , existing global optimization methods are very computationally intensive . improved performance can be achieved by combining gradient methods and global optimization methods , called hybrid methods . a hybrid method based on the scatter search and",
    "sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) has been proposed by rodriguez - fernandez , egea and banga  ( @xcite ) , who showed that the hybrid scatter search method is much faster than the differential evolution method for a simple hiv ode model . however , our preliminary work did not show improved performance of the scatter search method without sqp with respect to the differential evolution method in terms of computational cost and convergence rate .",
    "thus , the performance improvement of the hybrid scatter search method is mainly due to the incorporation of the sqp local optimization method .",
    "in addition , vrugt and robinson ( @xcite ) suggested that a significant improvement of efficiency can be achieved by combining multiple global optimization algorithms .",
    "here we combined the differential evolution and the scatter search method and incorporated with the sqp local optimization method [ e.g. , solnp by ye ( @xcite ) ] for parameter estimation of ode models .",
    "we present the details of the proposed algorithm in the .",
    "another critical problem that needs to be addressed in order to fit models  ( [ 3dmodeletaspline : eq1])([3dmodeletaspline : eq3 ] ) is to determine the order @xmath110 and the number and positions of control points @xmath116 for the spline approximation . in general",
    ", we assume that @xmath14 is a first - order continuous function of time .",
    "therefore , b - splines of order 2 ( piecewise straight lines ) should not be considered . also , since the high order b - spline approximation ( e.g. , @xmath131 ) may introduce unnecessary violent local oscillations ( called runge s phenomenon ) [ runge ( @xcite ) ] , we consider up to 4th order b - splines in this study . as to the positions of the control points , to account for highly - skewed data , we select the control points positions such that they are equally - spaced in the logarithm time scale",
    ". we can use aic , bic and aicc criteria [ akaike ( @xcite ) , schwarz ( @xcite ) , burnham and anderson ( @xcite ) ] to determine the order and the knots , that is , @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the likelihood function , @xmath9 the total number of observations and  @xmath134 the number of unknown parameters . under the normality assumption of measurement errors ,",
    "these model selection criteria can be rewritten as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the residual of sum squares obtained from the nls model fitting .",
    "it should also be noticed that , as the number of spline knots goes to large , the associated parameter space will be high - dimensional . in this case , the novel and efficient optimization methods such as the hybrid optimization algorithms are necessary to locate the global minima of the nls objective function .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to predetermine a good and informative search range for each of the unknown parameters in order to ease the computational burden of the proposed optimization algorithm .",
    "thus , it is necessary and a good strategy to combine the proposed two approaches to estimate the dynamic parameters in a complex dynamic system .",
    "that is , first the mssb approach introduced in the previous section can be used to obtain a rough estimate and the search range for the unknown parameters , and then the snls approach can be used to refine the estimates .",
    "in this section we evaluate the performance of the mssb and the snls approaches based on equations  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) by monte carlo simulations .",
    "an ad hoc bandwidth selection procedure is used for selecting a  proper bandwidth @xmath40 for mssb .",
    "see liang and wu ( @xcite ) for more detailed discussions .",
    "the following parameter values were used to generate simulation data : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",

    "frequent viral load measurements were scheduled at baseline and after initiating the combination treatment : 13 measurements during the first day , 14 measurements from day 2 to week 2 , and then one measurement at each of the following weeks , 4 , 8 , 12 , 14 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 48 , 52 , 56 , 64 , 74 and 76 , respectively .",
    "total cell counts were monitored at weeks 2 , 4 and monthly thereafter .",
    "as suggested in section  [ multi - stage ] , first we applied the nonlinear regression model in perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to fit the viral load data for the first week to obtain the estimates of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the estimation results for the two patients are as follows : patient  i , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ; and patient  ii , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "then we applied the proposed mssb and snls approaches to estimate all other viral dynamic parameters including the time - varying parameter @xmath14 in models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath167 transformation of the data was used in order to stabilize the variance and computational algorithms .",
    "a rough estimate and a reasonable search range for each of the unknown parameters and the initial values of the state variables were obtained using the mssb method .",
    "then we applied the snls approach to refine the estimates .",
    "for the snls approach , we selected the smoothing parameters using the aic , bic and aicc .",
    "we considered all the combinations of two spline orders ( 3 and 4 ) and  8 different numbers of control points ( from 3 to 10 ) , and the results are reported in  [ patientonemodelselect ] and [ patienttwomodelselect ] for patients i and ii , respectively . note that as a practical guideline , if the number of unknown parameters exceeds @xmath168 ( where @xmath21 is the number of measurements ) , the aicc instead of aic should be used . for our clinical data , @xmath21 is about 40 , and the number of unknown parameters varies between  8 and 15 for different models ( the unknown initial conditions were also considered as unknown parameters ) , which is much larger than @xmath169 .",

    "we can also see that the difference in the estimated dynamic parameters between the two patients is large .",
    "this is consistent with the argument that the between - subject variation of viral dynamics in aids patients is large [ wu and ding ( @xcite ) , wu et al .",

    "it seems that there was an initial fluctuation in the infection rate at the beginning of treatment , and then the infection rate was stabilized after one or two weeks .",
    "we can also see that the estimated infection rate is not zero , which may suggest the imperfectness of the long - term treatment and the development of drug - resistant mutants .",
    "this is inconsistent with the perfect treatment assumption in perelson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , although it may be valid in a short period of time after initiating the treatment .",
    "we have proposed two approaches to identify all dynamic parameters including both constant and time - varying parameters in an hiv viral dynamic model which is characterized by a set of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "this is a very challenging problem in the history of hiv dynamic studies .",
    "the proposed multistage smoothing - based ( mssb ) approach is straightforward and easy to implement since it does not require numerically solving the odes and the initial values of the state variables are not needed .",
    "however , one limitation of this approach is that it requires the estimates of derivatives of the state variables , which are usually poor when the data are sparse .",
    "this may result in poor estimates of unknown dynamic parameters .",
    "the second method that we proposed is the spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) approach .",
    "this method is more accurate in estimating the unknown parameters , but it requires numerical evaluations of odes repeatedly in the optimization procedure and the convergence of the computational algorithm is problematic when the parameter space is high - dimensional .",
    "we have proposed a hybrid optimization technique to deal with the nonconvergence and the local solution problems , but the computational cost is high and a good search range for each of the unknown parameters is required . in practical implementation , we propose to combine the two approaches , that is , first using the mssb approach to obtain rough estimates and possible ranges for the unknown parameters and then using the snls approach to refine the estimates .",
    "we have applied this strategy to estimate all dynamic parameters from data for two aids patients .",
    "it is very important to estimate all dynamic parameters in hiv dynamic models directly from clinical data when prior knowledge is not available or fixing some parameters will significantly affect the estimates of other parameters in a dynamic model . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first attempt to propose a procedure to estimate both constant and time - varying parameters in the proposed hiv dynamic model directly from clinical data .",
    "although huang , liu and wu ( @xcite ) have attempted to do so using a bayesian approach , strong priors were used for most of the dynamic parameters and a parametric form for the time - varying parameter was employed .",
    "notice that the time - varying parameter @xmath14 is a function of antiviral treatment effect in the hiv dynamic model [ huang , liu and wu ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "it is very important to estimate this time - varying parameter for each aids patient individually in order to better design the treatment strategy and personalize the treatment for each individual .",
    "in addition , to better assess the treatment efficacy , the time - varying infection rate @xmath14 can be further modeled as @xmath174 , where @xmath175 denotes the infection rate at the pre - treatment equilibrium , and @xmath176 the time - varying infection rate after treatment . by comparing @xmath175 with @xmath14",
    ", it will be easy to quantify the treatment effects on infection rate .",
    "however , since @xmath175 is strongly correlated with @xmath176 , @xmath177 has to be fixed to estimate @xmath176 .",
    "unfortunately , the pre - treatment equilibrium data were not collected in this study such that we could not determine the value of @xmath175 and therefore to do the comparison .",
    "finally , the treatment could also affect parameter @xmath9 ; however , limited by the clinical measurements , we simplified our model without considering parameter @xmath9 as time - varying .",
    "we used both viral load and cell count data in order to identify all dynamic parameters in the hiv dynamic models  ( [ 3dmodel : eq1])([3dmodel : eq3 ] ) .",
    "usually aids investigators believe that cell count data are very noisy with a large variation due to both measurement errors and natural variations of cell counts .",
    "thus , it is important to improve the data quality in order to get more reliable estimates of dynamic parameters , although it is beyond statisticians control .",
    "our study also suggests that the frequent measurements , in particular , the viral load measurements during the early stage after initiating an antiviral therapy , are important to identify some constant dynamic parameters such as @xmath8 and @xmath7 , and long - term monitoring of viral load and cell counts is necessary to estimate other parameters , in particular , the time - varying parameter .",
    "the differential evolution ( de ) algorithm [ storn and price ( @xcite ) ] is a typical evolutionary algorithm that searches the optimum by inheritance , mutation , selection and crossover of parent populations ( e.g. , vectors of possible parameter values in the parameter space ) .",
    "the initial population is randomly generated from a uniform distribution within the search range to cover the whole region , denoted by @xmath178 @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the number of members in this generation .",
    "the subsequent population inherits and mutates by randomly mixing the previous generation with certain weights .",
    "storn and price ( @xcite ) recommended a mutation method @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the @xmath44th member of generation @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 the members of the previous generation @xmath187 , and @xmath188 the amplification factor .",
    "integers @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are randomly chosen from @xmath192 which are mutually different from each other and different from @xmath44 . also , to increase diversity , the mutated member @xmath182 exchanges its components with @xmath178 with a given probability , the crossover ratio . for this purpose ,",
    "a number within @xmath193 $ ] is generated for each component of @xmath182 by a uniform random number generator .",
    "if this number is greater than the crossover ratio , then the component of @xmath178 is kept .",
    "finally , the best member in the mutated population is selected by comparing the values of the objective function .",
    "the convergence rate of the differential evolution method depends on specific mutation strategies used , that is , the amplification factor and the crossover ratio .",

    "let @xmath206 denote the total number of parameter vectors in the first population , then @xmath196 parameter vectors are generated first such that the @xmath44th component of the @xmath159th vector falls into @xmath201 . in this way ,",
    "all elements of matrix @xmath203 become one . to generate the rest @xmath207 parameter vectors in the first population ,",

    "once the first population is generated , the parameter vectors are divided into two categories : _ elite vectors _ and _ diverse vectors_. let @xmath213 denote the number of all elite vectors , which is usually a small fixed number ( e.g. , 20 ) .",
    "then @xmath214 elite vectors are chosen based on the smallest objective function values ; the rest half of the elite vectors are chosen to be farthest from all the first half elite vectors in the sense of euclidean distances . thus , both fitness and diversity are considered in the construction of the elite vectors",
    ". then the new parameter vectors can be generated by combination of the elite vectors .",
    "let @xmath215 and @xmath216 denote two different elite vectors and @xmath215 has a smaller objective function value than @xmath216 .",
    "then three types of combinations can be employed to generate new parameter vectors :    * type 1 : @xmath217 , * type 2 : @xmath218 , * type 3 : @xmath219 ,    where @xmath220 with all the components of @xmath221 generated from an uniform distribution on @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "if both @xmath215 and @xmath216 are in the first half elite vectors in terms of fitness , one new vector of type 1 , one of type 3 and two of type 2 are generated ; if only @xmath215 belongs to the first half elite vectors in terms of fitness , one new vector of each type is generated ; if both @xmath215 and @xmath216 belong to the second half elite vectors in terms of farthest distance , then one new vector of type 2 and one of either type 1 or 3 are generated .",
    "the fitness of these new generated vectors is then compared to that of the elite vectors .",
    "the new vectors with smaller objective function values ( that is , better fit ) will replace the elite vectors with larger objective function values .",

    "<S> modeling viral dynamics in hiv / aids studies has resulted in a deep understanding of pathogenesis of hiv infection from which novel antiviral treatment guidance and strategies have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> viral dynamics models based on nonlinear differential equations have been proposed and well developed over the past few decades . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is quite challenging to use experimental or clinical data to estimate the unknown parameters ( both constant and time - varying parameters ) in complex nonlinear differential equation models . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , investigators usually fix some parameter values , from the literature or by experience , to obtain only parameter estimates of interest from clinical or experimental data . however , when such prior information is not available , it is desirable to determine all the parameter estimates from data . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we intend to combine the newly developed approaches , a multi - stage smoothing - based ( mssb ) method and the spline - enhanced nonlinear least squares ( snls ) approach , to estimate all hiv viral dynamic parameters in a nonlinear differential equation model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to propose a comparatively thorough procedure , accounting for both efficiency and accuracy , to rigorously estimate all key kinetic parameters in a nonlinear differential equation model of hiv dynamics from clinical data . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters include the proliferation rate and death rate of uninfected hiv - targeted cells , the average number of virions produced by an infected cell , and the infection rate which is related to the antiviral treatment effect and is time - varying . to validate the estimation methods </S>",
    "<S> , we verified the identifiability of the hiv viral dynamic model and performed simulation studies . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the proposed techniques to estimate the key hiv viral dynamic parameters for two individual aids patients treated with antiretroviral therapies . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that hiv viral dynamics can be well characterized and quantified for individual patients . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> personalized treatment decision based on viral dynamic models is possible .    ,    . </S>"
