    "the back - reaction of lorentz forces on the fluid circulation in the convective zone of a rotating late - type star is of fundamental importance in theories of stellar magnetic - field generation . over the last decade or so",
    ", a consensus has emerged among dynamo theorists that this back - reaction could have a significant influence on the differential rotation pattern in the convective zones of the sun and active late - type stars ( see , e.g. ) .",
    "the quasi - cyclic orbital period changes observed among short - period binaries with magnetically - active components provide further indirect evidence that substantial changes in differential rotation could be taking place on active binary components .",

    "this can be sufficient to produce orbital period changes as large as the fractional @xmath1 observed in hr 1099 by .",
    "in this paper we report observations of long - term changes in surface differential rotation on the young , rapidly rotating k0 dwarf ab doradus , providing independent support for this theory .",
    "we apply a new method for determining the latitudes and rotation rates of individual starspots @xcite to six sets of archival time - resolved echelle spectroscopy of ab dor , spanning the period from 1988 december to 1996 december .",

    "we have found that the differential rotation rate of the young k0 dwarf ab dor varies by a factor 2 on a timescale of a few years .",
    "while the 8-year timespan of the observations presented here is too short to determine whether we are seeing a cyclic phenomenon , the apparent smoothness of the increase and decline in the differential rotation suggests that the changes occur on a timescale of order a decade or two .",
    "the variation resembles a wave of excess rotation , originating at the equator in 1992 and propagating poleward .    and",
    "have shown that changes in magnetic flux threading the convective zone during a stellar magnetic cycle may alter the viscous transport of angular momentum sufficiently to produce substantial changes in differential rotation .",
    "ab dor was rotating most rigidly in late 1988 , at a time when the star s maximum light level was depressed by 0.2 mag or so relative to photometry secured in the early 1980s and mid-1990s @xcite .",
    "the increase in differential rotation between 1988 and early 1992 coincides with a 0.1-mag rise in the maximum brightness of the star .",
    "the maximum brightness of the star remained steady between 1992 and late 1996 , as the differential rotation began gradually to decrease again .",
    "the timescales of the long - term changes in starspot coverage and differential rotation thus appear to be comparable , though we can not yet determine how closely the spot coverage and differential rotation rate are linked .",
    "these departures from the time - averaged differential rotation pattern are between one and two orders of magnitude greater than the waves of excess and deficit rotational velocity  sometimes described as `` torsional oscillations ''  that migrate equatorward during the solar spot cycle @xcite .",
    "these departures from the mean solar rotational velocity have amplitudes of order 5 m  s@xmath2 . at the equator of ab dor , however , a change in period from 0.5137 to 0.5128 days corresponds to a 200 m  s@xmath2 change in @xmath3 .",
    "if we consider the full change @xmath4 radian d@xmath2 in the equator - pole beat frequency , we find that @xmath0 .",
    "such a large modulation of the surface differential rotation will alter the star s oblateness sufficiently that , if ab dor were in a close binary system , it would be expected to produce observable long - term orbital period changes . by way of comparison , the k2v primary of the binary system v471 tau has a spectral type and rotation period very similar to those of ab dor .",
    "points out that the observed 20-year , @xmath5 modulation of the orbital period in v471 tau @xcite would require a variable differential rotation in the k star , with @xmath6 .",
    "the observed changes in ab dor s differential rotation are of precisely the magnitude required by the model to explain the orbital period variations in v471 tau .",
    "this paper is based on observations made using the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope , the 3.6-m telescope at eso and the 4-m telescope at ctio . the project made use of support software and data analysis facilities provided by the starlink project which is run by cclrc on behalf of pparc .",
