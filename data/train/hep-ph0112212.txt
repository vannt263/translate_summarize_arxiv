    "<S> we have recently proposed a mechanism of photon - axion oscillations as a way of rendering supernovae dimmer without cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , it has been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this mechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that this energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free electron density in the universe . decreasing the electron density by only a factor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the experimental bounds . </S>",
    "<S> models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts @xmath0 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density significantly lower than the average density . from these models </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a factor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being uniformly distributed and ionized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the energy dependence of the photon - axion oscillations is consistent with experiment , and the oscillation model remains a viable alternative to the accelerating universe for explaining the supernova observations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the electron density does give rise to a sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon - axion mixing above microwave frequencies , shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion conversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass implied by the oscillation model .    </S>",

    "<S> this mechanism requires the photon - axion coupling scale to be @xmath8 gev and assumes an axion mass @xmath9 ev , and an intergalactic magnetic field @xmath10 g , with a domain size of order a mpc , in agreement with observational bounds @xcite . detailed properties of the model were investigated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation mechanism rests on two key ingredients :    * the photon - axion oscillation probability of photons with energy @xmath11 induced by the off - diagonal element @xmath12 of the mixing matrix @xmath13 @xcite should be non - negligible over a significant fraction of the line of sight , e.g. over a few thousand magnetic domains ; * the magnetic field of essentially random direction over many domains will induce a decrease of photon flux saturating at about 2/3 of its original value , independently of the detailed structure of the magnetic field and the precise form of the mixing , provided the mixing is not negligibly small .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequently the authors of  @xcite argued that photon rescattering in the ionized gas comprising the intergalactic medium ( igm ) could have rendered the oscillations very energy - dependent , which would have been inconsistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> namely in the presence of ionized electrons the mixing matrix is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the plasma frequency @xcite @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the electron density , @xmath18 the electron mass , and @xmath19 the fine structure constant . </S>",
    "<S> then the conversion probability of photons into axions over a domain of size @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 \\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{prob}\\ ] ] using this formula one can estimate the largest allowed value of @xmath22 for which the energy dependence of the dimming effect is within the observational bounds . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the magnetic domain size is @xmath23 mpc  @xcite , and that there are about 3000 domains for supernovae at redshifts @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider photons of average energy of 4.3 ev in the b band and average energy of 3.4 ev in the v band , and require that the total difference in oscillation probabilities , i.e. for photon survival as a function of energy , is less than 3 percent  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these energy values are slightly higher to reflect the redshift of the photon energies as they journey from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ; we simply pick the energies at @xmath27 . the resulting difference in the oscillation probabilities </S>",
    "<S> is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : difference ] . </S>",
    "<S> this figure is probably an overestimate of the energy dependence since we have simply added the probabilities over all the domains , while in reality the photon conversion saturates at a value of @xmath28 due to the random direction of the magnetic field in different domains . </S>",
    "<S> even so , we can see that if the plasma frequency obeys @xmath29 ev the energy dependence disappears very rapidly , and becomes undetectable by present observations . </S>",
    "<S> this threshold value of @xmath15 corresponds to a free electron density of @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite chose the value of the electron density to be @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this is barely above the threshold below which the energy dependence of oscillations becomes unobservable . on the other hand , if all of the baryons in our universe had been uniformly distributed and fully ionized , the electron density would have been is the baryon fraction of the energy density of the universe , the hubble parameter is @xmath32 km / s / mpc , the critical density is @xmath33 , and that 10% of baryons are neutrons in helium nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we are ignoring the tiny fractions of heavier elements . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the value assumed in @xcite corresponds to roughly a half of all baryons being uniformly distributed and ionized . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is very likely too high , by at least a factor of 15 , in the region @xmath24 which is the relevant regime for our model since most of the observed supernovae reside in this range . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction of @xmath17 would render the energy dependence unobservable at present .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss why the electron density has to be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the distribution of baryons at low redshifts @xmath35 is an open problem in cosmology @xcite . at low redshifts </S>",
    "<S> the baryons are thought to be divided among the following structures in the universe @xcite :    .3 cm @xmath36 condensed baryons in stars and galactic gas    @xmath36 hot baryons in galaxy clusters and groups    @xmath36 whim : warm - hot intergalactic matter    @xmath36 photoionized intergalactic gas ( lyman @xmath19 forests ) . </S>",
    "<S> .3 cm    at low redshifts the baryons are roughly equally distributed between the condensed and hot baryons , the whim , and the lyman @xmath19 forests . </S>",
    "<S> the former structures are very strongly clumped , occupying a tiny fraction of total volume of space at @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore they are unimportant for the photon - axion oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the only relevant baryons are about @xmath28 of the total , residing in the lyman @xmath19 forests . </S>",
    "<S> they comprise a diffuse photoionized gas with relatively low temperature , @xmath38 k. but even if all of this gas were uniformly distributed , the electron density would have been at most @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the low temperature and the highly ionized nature of this gas makes the low density regions extremely difficult to observe directly . </S>",
    "<S> there are no direct observational bounds on the distribution of low density lyman @xmath19 forests , and hence no direct evidence for the distribution at @xmath24 to be uniform . instead </S>",
    "<S> , most of the standard lore concerning low - density , low - redshift plasma comes from model - dependent simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> while the assumption for uniformity would be very accurate for large values of redshifts ( @xmath40 ) , for low @xmath41 even the low - density gas in the lyman @xmath19 forests tends to clump . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations and the existing observations about the regions of gas with significantly higher than average density show that it is unlikely that gas in the lyman @xmath19 forests would be uniformly distributed in space . indeed , at @xmath42 the average overdensity of these kinds of structures is in the range 10100 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their characteristic radial size is @xmath43 kpc @xcite , and they take up only a small fraction of space . </S>",
    "<S> almost all the observed lyman @xmath19 forests fall into this category . </S>",
    "<S> these forests are correlated with galaxies : they tend to reside around the halos of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations also display a correlation of even the low density forests with the large scale structure of the universe , supporting the claim that for low redshifts even this gas is clumped . in the analytic model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at low redshifts about 97 % of space is filled with low - density gas , which is underdense by at least a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is reasonable to assume that over most of space at redshifts @xmath24 the electron density is at most @xmath44 , and probably even less than that . in the absence of direct observational evidence one can not of course completely exclude somewhat larger densities , but all the indirect evidence favors the above number as a reasonable bound at low redshifts . with this value of the electron density </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency is @xmath45 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this places it safely in the regime where the energy dependence of the supernova dimming is below the current experimental sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> a closer scrutiny actually reveals that the effects of intergalactic plasma are beneficial for our model because they make it insensitive to the axion mass as long as it is below the plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> previously , we had selected the value of the axion mass to suppress the mixing between cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and axions , giving @xmath46 ev </S>",
    "<S> . however , the plasma - generated effective photon mass has the right magnitude to suppress the photon - axion mixing at an energy above the cmb photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxes the lower bound on the axion mass for the model , since now the axion mass could be considerably smaller the igm was neutral , removing the plasma and therefore the photon mass . </S>",
    "<S> at present it is not known how the background magnetic fields emerged , and so they could still have been large enough at such high redshifts to affect cmbr if the axion was too light . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> one may also ask if the axion - photon coupling should be changed because of the plasma - induced photon mass . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : energy ] we have plotted the oscillation probability in a magnetic domain as a function of energy for the original scenario with @xmath47 , and for the case with @xmath48 ev . </S>",
    "<S> one sees immediately that for optical photons , @xmath49 ev , the change of the oscillation probability in a domain is very small , with the main difference being that the oscillations are cut off at energies closer to the optical regime than before . </S>",
    "<S> thus the plasma effects do not require a significant alteration of the axion - photon coupling .    in summary , we have considered the effect of the igm on our proposed mechanism @xcite for supernova dimming via photon - axion oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the effects of the intergalactic plasma are very sensitive to the precise value of the plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we have put a conservative bound on the plasma frequency by combining the observations and the simulations of the igm , and found that the plasma effects would not strongly influence the oscillations of optical photons . </S>",
    "<S> instead they would provide a natural cutoff on the oscillations at energies below the optical range ; this relaxes the lower bounds on the mass of the axion . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the photon - axion oscillation mechanism remains a viable alternative to the accelerating universe for explaining the supernova observations . </S>"
