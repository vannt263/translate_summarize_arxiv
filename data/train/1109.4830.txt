    "@xcite identified more than 300 galactic extended 4.5 @xmath8 m sources , naming extended green objects ( egos ) or `` green fuzzies '' , for the common coding of the [ 4.5 @xmath8 m ] band as green in three - color composite infrared array camera images from the _ spitzer _ telescope . according to the authors , an ego is a probable massive young stellar object ( myso ) driving outflows . the extended emission in the 4.5 @xmath8 m band is supposed to be due to h@xmath9 ( @xmath10 , s(9,10,11 ) ) lines and co ( @xmath11 ) band heads , that are excited by the shock of the outflows propagating in the interstellar medium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first direct spectroscopic identification of the origin of the 4.5 @xmath8 m emission towards two egos using niri on the gemini north telescope . in one of the observed egos , they proved that the 4.5 @xmath8 m emission is due primarily to lines of molecular hydrogen , which are collisionally excited .",
    "ego g35.03 + 0.35 ( hereafter egog35 ) is embedded in a dense molecular cloud at the distance of 3.5 kpc @xcite located on the border of the infrared dust bubble n65 @xcite . according to @xcite",
    "there are several young stellar object ( yso ) candidates around n65 , being egog35 the most prominent source . using ir and sub - mm fluxes measured from this ego",
    ", the authors performed an spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , showing that this source is indeed a massive stellar object at the earlier stages of evolution with outflowing activity .",
    "the 4.5 @xmath8 m emission of this ego has a bipolar morphology , with one lobe to the ne and the other to the sw .",
    "the source presents maser emission of several molecular lines ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , ch@xmath12oh maser emission at 6.7 and 44 ghz has been detected and analysed by @xcite .",
    "the 6.7 ghz ch@xmath12oh masers are radiatively pumped by ir emission from the warm dust associated exclusively with massive ysos , while the methanol maser at 44 ghz is collisionally excited in molecular outflows , and particularly at interfaces between outflows and the surrounding ambient cloud ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "considering that egog35 is indeed a massive yso evolving in a dense molecular medium , it is important to understand the physical characteristics of its ambient medium .",
    "we investigated this ambient through several molecular lines obtained with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",
    "the results of this investigation are presented in this work .",
    "the molecular observations were performed on july 14 and 15 , 2010 with the 10 m atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the cats345 ghz band receiver , which is a two - single band sis receiver remotely tunable in the lo frequency range of 324 - 372 ghz .",
    "we simultaneously observed j=32 at 345.796 ghz and hco@xmath3  j=43 at 356.734 ghz , mapping a region of 70  @xmath13 80  centered at ra @xmath14 18540.7 , dec .",
    "@xmath15020118.9 , j2000 ) .",
    "we also observed j=32 at 330.588 ghz and cs j=76 at 342.883 ghz towards the same center mapping a region of 40  @xmath13 50 .",
    "the mapping grid spacing was 10  and the integration time was 60 sec per pointing in both cases .",
    "all the observations were performed in position switching mode .",
    "we verified that the off position ( ra @xmath14 185355.8 , dec .",
    "@xmath15020749.5 , j2000 ) was to be free of emission .",
    "we used the xf digital spectrometer with a bandwidth and spectral resolution set to 128 mhz and 125 khz , respectively .",
    "the velocity resolution was 0.11 and the half - power beamwidth ( hpbw ) was 22 , for all observed molecular lines .",
    "the system temperature varied from t@xmath16 to 200 k. the main beam efficiency was @xmath17 .",
    "the spectra were hanning smoothed to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and only linear or / and some third order polynomia were used for baseline fitting .",
    "the data were reduced with newstar and the spectra processed using the xspec software package .    to complement the molecular data we use near- and mid - ir and radio continuum data from public databases and catalogues , which are described in the corresponding sections .",
    "the source ego g35.03@xmath00.35 ( egog35 ) is located at the border of an hii region which is delineated mainly by the 8 @xmath8 m emission .",
    "figure [ present ] ( left ) shows a composite three - color image of a region towards egog35 .",
    "the image displays three _ spitzer_-irac bands : 3.6 @xmath8 m ( in blue ) , 4.5 @xmath8 m ( in green ) and 8 @xmath8 m ( in red ) .",
    "egog35 is the green structure inside the dashed rectangles , which represent the 70  @xmath13 80  and 40  @xmath13 50  regions mapped in the molecular lines as described in the previous section .",
    "a zoom in of the surveyed region is shown in fig . [ present ] ( right ) .      to study the molecular ambient where egog35 is embedded , we analyse the and j=32 , hco@xmath3  j=43 and cs j=76 transitions , tracers of outflows and dense gas . figures [ obs1 ] and [ obs2 ] display the molecular lines spectra obtained towards egog35",
    ". most of the spectra are far of having a simple gaussian shape , presenting asymmetries , probable absorption dips , and spectral wings or shoulders , which suggest that the molecular gas is affected by the dynamics of egog35 . in what follows we study the gas kinematics .",

    "[ obs1 ] and [ obs2 ] . in the case of the hco@xmath3 j=43 and cs j=76 lines ,",
    "their brightness temperatures were scaled with a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ spec00zoom ] displays a zoom - in of the central and j=32 profiles in the intensity range that goes from @xmath19 to 2 k , in order to note some weak features . in the case of the line",
    "can be appreciated a weak component ( @xmath20 times above the rms noise ) centered at @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters determined from gaussian fitting of these lines are presented in table [ lines ] .",
    "t@xmath22 represents the peak brightness temperature , v@xmath23 the central velocity referred to the local standard of rest .",
    "errors are formal 1@xmath24 value for the model of the gaussian line shape .",
    "all the lines were well fit with more than one gaussian function , which very likely indicates the presence of several components or / and spectral wings , usually signatures of outflows . in table",
    "[ lines2 ] we present v@xmath25 and v@xmath26 , indicating the respective total widths of the spectra considering all the components , and @xmath27 , the intensity integrated over the whole profile .    the j=32 spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ spec00 ] shows a double peak structure like with a main component centered at @xmath2854.2 and a less intense component centered at @xmath2848.7 .",
    "the j=32 spectrum presents similar features .",
    "we conclude that these lines present an absorption dip at @xmath2851.5 which separates both mentioned velocity components , showing that the lines are self - absorbed as it is usually found towards star - forming regions @xcite . the velocity of the mentioned and dip is coincident ( within the errors ) with the central velocities of the sio ( 54 ) , h@xmath2co@xmath3 ( 32 ) , and ch@xmath12oh ( 5@xmath294@xmath30 ) lines observed towards the center of egog35 by @xcite and with the cs j=76 main component reported in this work .",
    "therefore , we conclude that v @xmath2851.5 is the velocity of the ambient gas , and the other reported components ( see table [ lines ] ) may be related to outflows or / and high velocity material . in section [ secoutflow ]",
    "we analyse this contention .",
    ".observed parameters of the molecular lines shown in figure [ spec00 ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ outf ]    the derived mass and energy for the outflows discovered towards egog35 are similar to those of massive and energetic molecular outflows driven by high - mass ysos @xcite .",
    "we do not provide estimates of outflow dynamical timescale and mass rate because the analysed high velocity material is aligned along the line of sight , and therefore it is not possible to estimate the lengths of the outflow lobes .",
    "in fact , with the moderate angular resolution of the present observations , it is possible that we miss the emission of the outflows along the plane of the sky .",
    "molecular observations with higher angular resolution are needed to spatially resolve the outflows .",
    "@xcite performed a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of egog35 concluding that the source is indeed a massive yso .",
    "taking into account that at present it is available new mid - ir fluxes obtained from wise preliminary release source catalog , in this section we perform a new sed of the source to study with more accuracy its physical parameters .",
    "the advantage of this new sed is that the wise data present fluxes at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath8 m bands , being of importance the last two bands , mainly the 12 @xmath8 m , because the sed of a yso usually presents the separation between the contributions from the disk and envelope fluxes around this wavelength .",
    "thus , we fit the sed using the tool developed by @xcite .",
    "we use the fluxes in the four _ spitzer_-irac bands obtained from @xcite together with the wise fluxes , and the scuba bands at 450 and 850 @xmath8 m ( source g35.02 + 0.35 , @xcite ) .",
    "the fluxes at 22 @xmath8 m from wise and scuba bands were taken as upper limits as they have lower angular resolution and they can include contributions from other sources around egog35 . as done in @xcite we assume an interstellar absorption between 15 and 35 magnitudes and a distance range between 3 and 4 kpc . in fig .",
    "[ sed1 ] we show the seds of the 20 best fitting models .",
    "the solid black line represents the best fitting model from which we obtain the following parameters : @xmath31  m@xmath32 , @xmath33  m@xmath32 , and @xmath34  m@xmath35 .",
    "we do not report the disk mass because is not well constrained in the sed fitting . as @xcite point out , in the early stages of evolution , when the disk is deeply embedded inside the infalling envelope , the relative contributions of the disk and envelope to the sed are difficult to disentangle .         following the @xcite evolutionary classification , the best fitting model ( and also the following 80 fitting models )",
    "correspond to a stage i yso , i.e. , a protostar with large accretion envelope . in fig .",
    "[ sed2 ] we present the histograms with the distribution of the constrained physical parameters .",
    "the hashed columns represent the 20 best fitting models and the gray columns correspond to all the models of the grid .",
    "we remark that the 20 best fitting models correspond to massive central sources ( between 8 and 20  m@xmath32 ) surrounded by massive envelopes with large accretion rates .",
    "regarding the age of the source , there is a high dispersion in the results ( ages range from @xmath36  to @xmath37 years ) but the presence of a massive envelope is a strong evidence that the source is at the earliest evolutionary stage .       over the irac-_spitzer _",
    "4.5 @xmath8 m emission .",
    "the radio continuum has a beam of 14 @xmath13 10 while the angular resolution of the mid - ir emission is about 15.,width=283 ]    we investigate the radio continuum emission at 8.4 ghz of egog35 . to produce the image we used archival data from observations performed with the vla telescope operating in its b configuration on may 7 and 14 , 2009 ( project code ac948 ) . data processing was carried out using miriad software package .",
    "the final image has an angular resolution of 14 @xmath13 10 and an rms noise of 0.1 mjy beam@xmath38 .",
    "figure [ radio ] shows , in contours , the radio continuum emission of egog35 over its mid - ir emission at 4.5 @xmath8 m .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , there are three radio sources : source a which coincides with the ir southwestern lobe of the egog35 , source b that appears in between the ir lobes , and source c , marginally detected , which is projected onto the northeastern lobe of the ego . the radio source",
    "a , the brightest and the only one resolved with this data set , is centered at 185400.49 , @xmath0020118.20  ( j2000 ) , and has an integrated flux density of 13.5 mjy .",
    "the source b is centered at 185400.66 , @xmath0020119.40  ( j2000 ) and has a peak intensity of 1 mjy beam@xmath38 , and source c is centered at 185400.76 , @xmath0020122.62  ( j2000 ) and its peak has a flux density of 0.3 mjy beam@xmath38 .",
    "source a and b were also detected at 44 ghz with a similar angular resolution by @xcite .",
    "the authors reported an integrated flux density of 12.7 mjy for the brightest radio source and a peak flux density of 3.6 mjy beam@xmath38 for source b. we calculate the spectral index @xmath39 ( s @xmath40 ) between both frequencies , being @xmath41 for source a , and @xmath42 for source b. the radio spectral index of the radio source a is consistent with emission from an uchii region , while the value obtained for source b suggests that its radio emission could be due either to an hchii region @xcite or to a constant - velocity ionized wind source @xcite .",
    "from this radio continuum analysis we can suggest the presence of several young stellar objects in the region .",
    "the fact that these radio sources overlap the 4.5  @xmath8 m emission reinforces the hypothesis that the infrared emission originates in yso shocks .",
    "the extended green object ego g35.03@xmath00.35 ( egog35 , in this work ) , a massive yso , is embedded in a molecular clump located at the border of an hii region . in this work we investigated the surrounding molecular gas through several molecular species using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",
    "we observed and analysed the and j=32 , hco@xmath3  j=43 and cs j=76 transitions , which are useful to trace outflows and dense gas . to complement our analysis we used ir and radio continuum data from public database . in what follows",
    "we summarize the main results of our work :    \\(1 ) most of the molecular spectra observed towards the surveyed region are far of having a simple gaussian shape , presenting asymmetries , absorption dips , and spectral wings or shoulders , characteristics that strongly suggest the existence of kinematical perturbations in the gas originated in the object egog35 .",
    "\\(2 ) the j=32 line towards egog35 shows a double peak structure like with a main component centered at @xmath2854 , a less intense component centered at @xmath2848 , and an absorption dip at @xmath2851.5 .",
    "the line also presents spectral wings due to the ouflowing activity of egog35 .",
    "we obtained a total mass and kinetic energy for the yso outflows of 30  and 3000 @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ergs ) , respectively , similar to those found towards other massive and energetic molecular outflows driven by high - mass ysos .",
    "\\(3 ) we discovered a hco@xmath3 clump towards egog35 , supporting the presence of outflows in the region because it is known that such molecular species enhances in the boundary layer between the outflow jet and the surrounding molecular core .",
    "the central hco@xmath3 spectra present an absorption dip at v @xmath43 due to self - absorbed gas , which is probably revealing the existence of a density gradient in the clump .",
    "\\(4 ) we discovered a cs clump towards egog35 .",
    "the cs j=76 emission maps the dense envelope where the massive yso is evolving , and its detection implies the presence of molecular gas with temperatures and densities above 40 k and @xmath6 @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "\\(5 ) the central hco@xmath3 and cs spectra , which survey the densest region where egog35 is embedded , show two velocity components with the closer one ( blue component ) stronger than the farthest one ( red component ) .",
    "this signature suggests that these lines are mapping infalling gas , which is consistent with the presence of a yso accreting material .",
    "\\(6 ) from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) study we confirm that egog35 is a massive yso at the earliest evolutionary stage ( i.e. a class i yso ) .",
    "\\(7 ) analysing radio continuum emission towards egog35 we conclude that there is evidence of the presence of an uchii region and another source that could be either an hchii region or a constant - velocity ionized wind source .",
    "the radio continuum analysis suggests the presence of several possible young stellar objects in the region .",
