    "chiral theory has caught up as an important tool to deal with hadron reactions at low and intermediate energies , accounting for the underlying basic qcd dynamics . by introducing chiral lagrangians where the explicit fields are mesons and baryons , a perturbative expansion in powers of momenta is done , leading to chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3 ) which has allowed great progress in hadron physics .",
    "a very important development in this direction is done with the introduction of unitarity in coupled channels which has allowed to extend the predictions of chiral theory at higher energies than is possible with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "a review of the basic ideas can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues of this unitarized theory is that it allows to deal with resonances , some of which appear necessarily as a consequence of the dynamics of the chiral lagrangians , in a similar way as bound states or resonances appear in potential theory in quantum mechanics .",
    "we call these resonances dynamically generated and by now about 10 - 15 percent of the particles in the pdg can qualify for this nature , meaning that the meson- meson cloud , or meson - baryon cloud , becomes the basic part of the wave function overriding the relevance of the primary building blocks : constituent @xmath4 or three @xmath5 for the case of mesons or baryons , respectively .",
    "i shall mention here some of these cases .",
    "the findings about the nature of some resonances have also consequences in nuclear physics , since basic features associated to the chiral dynamics of the resonances show up in interesting ways in nuclear processes which can then be used to stress the nature of these resonances .",
    "i shall also give some example of that in this talk .",
    "a more extensive description of the ideas exposed here can be found in @xcite , but we concentrate here on the recent developments not discussed in @xcite .",
    "we skip here details on the chiral lagrangians which can be found in @xcite and sketchhow unitarity enters the framework .",
    "one can find a systematic and easily comprehensible derivation of the ideas of the n / d method applied for the first time to the meson baryon system in @xcite , which we reproduce here below and which follows closely the similar developments used before in the meson meson interaction @xcite .",
    "one defines the transition @xmath6matrix as @xmath7 between the coupled channels which couple to certain quantum numbers .",
    "for instance in the case of @xmath8 scattering studied in @xcite the channels with zero charge are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "unitarity in coupled channels is written as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the modulus of the c.m .",
    "three  momentum , and the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the physical channels .",
    "this equation is most efficiently written in terms of the inverse amplitude as @xmath24 the unitarity relation in eq .",
    "( [ uni ] ) gives rise to a cut in the @xmath25matrix of partial wave amplitudes , which is usually called the unitarity or right  hand cut .",
    "hence one can write down a dispersion relation for @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the value of the @xmath29 variable at the threshold of channel @xmath22 and @xmath30 indicates other contributions coming from local and pole terms , as well as crossed channel dynamics but _ without _ right  hand cut .",
    "these extra terms are taken directly from @xmath3 after requiring the _ matching _ of the general result to the @xmath3 expressions .",
    "notice also that the curled bracket , that we call the @xmath31 function , is the familiar scalar loop integral .",
    "one can further simplify the notation by employing a matrix formalism . introducing the matrices @xmath32 , @xmath25 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the latter defined in terms of the matrix elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the @xmath25-matrix can be written as : @xmath36^{-1}\\cdot { \\mathcal{t}}(w)~.\\ ] ] which can be recast in a more familiar form as @xmath37 now imagine one is taking the lowest order chiral amplitude for the kernel @xmath33 as done in @xcite .",
    "then the former equation is nothing but the bethe salpeter equation with the kernel taken from the lowest order lagrangian and factorized on shell , the same approach followed in @xcite , where different arguments were used to justify the on shell factorization of the kernel .",
    "the on shell factorization of the kernel , justified here with the n / d method , renders the set of coupled bethe salpeter integral equations a simple set of algebraic equations .",
    "the amplitudes of the channels discussed above are extrapolated to the complex second riemann sheet and we search for poles there . here",
    "i discuss recent finding concerning the two poles corresponding to the @xmath0 resonance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracepole ] we can see , from the work of @xcite , the trajectories of the poles when we start from an su(3 ) symmetric situation and go to the real world where this symmetry is broken .",
    "this appears because of the different masses of the mesons and the baryon in the study of the interaction of the octet of the pion and the octet of the nucleon respectively .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetric case corresponds to the poles in the real axis where we have two degenerate octets and a singlet .",
    "as soon as su(3 ) symmetry starts being broken the degeneracy of the two octets disappears and two branches for i=0 and for i=1 develop which , at the end of the trajectories that represent the real world , correspond to well know resonances like the @xmath38 etc .     with @xmath39 running from 0 to 1 .",
    "the results are from @xcite . ]",
    "the interesting thing to note is that in the region of the @xmath0 there are two poles , one from the original singlet and another one from one of the branches of the original octet . in practice",
    "it is impossible to see two peaks in any reaction because the two resonances overlap , but the fact that the two poles couple differently to @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the narrower pole couples strongly to @xmath8 and the wider one to @xmath42 ) has as a consequence that the @xmath0 should show up with quite different shapes in different reactions depending on their particular dynamics .",
    "this is indeed the case as could be demonstrated recently with the performance of the @xmath43 @xcite experiment .",
    "this reaction has been studied in @xcite and the basic mechanism for the reaction is given by fig .",
    "[ two_exp ] left , where we see that it is dominated by the @xmath44 amplitude which has a strong contribution from the narrow pole at higher energies .",
    "we should then expect that the peak of the @xmath0 appears at higher energies in this reaction and with a smaller width , and this is the case as one can see in fig .",
    "[ two_exp ] right by comparing with the standard @xmath0 extracted from the @xmath45 reaction which was studied in @xcite .",
    "the two experimental figures for the shapes of the @xmath0 in both reactions can be seen in fig .",
    "[ two_exp ] right , giving a strong support to the existence of the two @xmath0 states .",
    "( left ) and two experimental shapes of @xmath0 resonance ( right ) .",
    "see text for more details.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and two experimental shapes of @xmath0 resonance ( right ) .",
    "see text for more details.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "given the success of the chiral unitary approach in generating dynamically low energy resonances from the interaction of the octets of stable baryons and the pseudoscalar mesons , in @xcite the interaction of the decuplet of @xmath46 with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons was studied and shown to lead to many states which were associated to experimentally well established @xmath47 resonances .",
    "one of these would correspond to the @xmath2 .",
    "in @xcite a refinement of the approach discussed above has been done including the @xmath8 and @xmath42 decay channels of the @xmath2 and finetuning the subtraction constants in the @xmath48 function , such that a good agreement with the position and width of the @xmath2 is attained . with this new information one",
    "can face the study of the reaction @xmath49 by using the mechanisms of @xmath50 which provides the dominant contribution to the reaction at energies close to the @xmath2 . at higher energies of the experiment of",
    "@xcite one finds other background mechanisms ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sigfig2 ] ) providing a contribution that helps bring the theory and experiment in good agreement , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ sigfig2 ] .",
    "one can see in the figure that up to 575 mev / c of momentum of the @xmath51 the mechanism based on the strong coupling of the @xmath2 to the @xmath52 channel is largely dominant and provides the right strength of the cross section .",
    "obviously it would be most interesting to investigate the region of lower energies of the @xmath51 in order to see if the predictions done by the theory are accurate .",
    "this could be done for a different reaction , the @xmath53 @xcite , where the cross section is double than for @xmath54 . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ sigfig2 ] , the predictions of the theory are in good agreement with the data .",
    "( left ) and @xmath53 @xcite right.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and @xmath53 @xcite right.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the @xmath55 interaction in a nuclear medium has been the subject of many studies . in @xcite a selfconsistent calculation of the @xmath55 nucleus optical potential",
    "is done and the results are consistent with data of kaonic atoms as shown in @xcite .",
    "this potential has a strength of about 50 mev attraction at normal nuclear matter and an imaginary part of about 50 mev .",
    "this leads to deeply bound states in nuclei of about 30 mev binding and widths of around 100 mev .",
    "it was hence surprising to find other potentials where , with only three nucleons , the @xmath55 potential reaches a strength of about 650 mev at the center for the nucleus @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection shows that the huge results come from several approximations among them the lack of selfconsistency in the calculations that , according to @xcite , leads to meaningless results , plus the shrinking of the nucleus to attain ten times nuclear matter density at the center of the nucleus .",
    "based on this potential , some peaks seen at kek in the proton spectra following the absorption of @xmath51 on @xmath56 were interpreted as a signal of deeply bound kaonic states .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that the peaks of the experiments could be easily interpreted in terms of @xmath51 absorption by pairs of nucleons leading to @xmath57 or @xmath58 without further interaction of the baryons with the nucleus",
    ". this claim has been recently reinforced by an experiment at finuda @xcite where the proton spectra is also studied following @xmath51 absorption in different nuclei and the same peaks are seen .",
    "an additional measurement of pions in coincidence shows that they come from the decay of the @xmath59 for the peak at lower proton momentum , hence , confirming the claims of @xcite .",
    "the finuda collaboration has another paper @xcite in which a wider peak has been seen in the invariant mass of @xmath60 measured back to back following @xmath51 absorption in different nuclei and which was claimed to correspond the a @xmath61 bound state . in another recent paper @xcite",
    "it has been shown that such a peak appears unavoidably as a consequence of the mechanism of @xmath51 absorption by a pair of nucleons going to @xmath60 , followed by rescattering of the @xmath62 or the @xmath63 in the nucleus .",
    "thus , the claims made for deeply bound kaons in nuclei with binding energies of about 200 mev and narrow widths are unfounded and this was the conclusion of a recent meeting explicitly devoted to this issue in @xmath64 trento @xcite .",
    "within these techniques there is work done in @xmath65 selfenergy in the medium , @xmath66 and @xmath67 renormalization in nuclei and others , but i shall concentrate here on the latest issue which has connections with section 4 , where we studied the interaction of the decupled of baryons with the octet of nucleons .",
    "the @xmath2 is one of the resonances dynamically generated with the channels @xmath52 and @xmath68 .",
    "actually , this picture is only qualitative since the @xmath2 couples also to the @xmath42 and @xmath8 channels to which it decays .",
    "the study done in @xcite including these channels finds that the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath52 is the strongest of all , as if it kept memory of what would happen in a simplified ideal world .",
    "selfnergy in the nuclear medium ]    even if the @xmath2 couples strongly to the @xmath52 channel , it does not decay into this state because it is below the threshold of @xmath52 .",
    "however , in a nucleus the pion can easily excite a @xmath69 which has energy starting from zero .",
    "thus we gain 140 mev phase space for the decay and this leads to a width in the medium from only this channel which is already bigger than the 14 mev free width of the @xmath2 .",
    "this is not the only source of medium modification for the resonance , since the other decay channels are also modified in the medium .",
    "a detailed study has been done @xcite ( see diagrams in fig .  [ diagrams ] ) and we present the results in fig .",
    "[ resultslam ] .",
    "selfenergy as a function of the nuclear density and @xmath2 momentum . ]",
    "the use of chiral lagrangians for the meson baryon interaction and the unitary extensions of chiral perturbation theory have allowed to face a large amount of problems which were barred to standard perturbation techniques .",
    "it has opened the door to the study of many baryonic resonances which qualify neatly as dynamically generated resonances , or quasibound states of meson baryon .",
    "thanks to this , a quantitative description of the meson baryon interaction at intermediate energies is now possible and with this , an important systematics has been introduced in the many body problem to face issues on the renormalization of hadron properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "the constructed scheme is rather powerful and allows to make predictions which consecutive experiments are proving right .",
    "two of these predictions , the two states for the @xmath0 , and the nature of the @xmath2 roughly as a quasibound state of @xmath52 , have found strong support from two very recent experiments .",
    "the spectacular change of the width of the @xmath2 in the medium is partly due to the strong coupling of the resonance to the @xmath52 as predicted by chiral unitary dynamics .",
    "finally , we also discussed that chiral theory , implementing selfconsistency in the many body calculation , leads to a moderate attraction for @xmath55 in nuclei , and that recents claims for deeply bound kaon states , which would require a huge @xmath55 optical potential , were a consequence of an incorrect identification of some peaks for which a natural conventional explanation has been just found .",
    "altogether , one is seeing through all this work that chiral dynamics is a key ingredient that allows a unified description of much of the hadronic world at low and intermediate energies .",
