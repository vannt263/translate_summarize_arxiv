    "the search for the higgs boson , the last missing particle in the standard model ( sm ) responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , is a primary goal of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and is a central part of fermilab s tevatron program . in the standard model , mass generation",
    "is triggered by the higgs mechanism , which predicts the existence of one scalar particle , the higgs boson  .",
    "the coupling of the higgs to fermions and gauge bosons is predicted by the model .",
    "the only unknown parameter is the higgs boson mass .",
    "direct searches at lep restrict the higgs boson mass to be greater than 114.4 gev ( at 95@xmath0 cl )  @xcite , while precision measurements point to a rather light higgs , @xmath1  gev ( @xmath2 cl ) which increases to @xmath3  gev when including the lepii direct search limit of @xmath4 gev ( see  @xcite for regular updates ) .",

    "+ the standard model higgs coupling is strongest to the heaviest particles",
    ". therefore , we distinguish three types of decays : into fermions , into massive gauge bosons and loop - induced decays through a massive loop of quarks or gauge bosons . since the lhc will be able to find the higgs ,",
    "if it exists , and can provide a measurement of its couplings at the @xmath6 level  @xcite , precise theoretical predictions of these decays are needed .",
    "+ understanding the theoretical prediction is crucial to both the search for and exclusion of the standard model higgs boson .",
    "backgrounds to the higgs signal are severe in many channels , particularly when a mass peak can not be reconstructed such as in  @xmath7 , and knowledge of the signal shape and normalization is needed to optimize experimental searches .",
    "signal and background cross sections must be , therefore , predicted as accurately as can be achieved .",
    "+ higgs production at both hadron colliders , tevatron and lhc , is dominated by gluon fusion , where two incoming gluons produce a higgs boson via a virtual top quark loop .",
    "this is followed by vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , where the incoming protons radiate a w or a z boson , which subsequently interact weakly and fuse into a higgs boson .",
    "the higgs can also be produced in association with a pair of top quarks or through higgs strahlung ( associated wh or zh production ) .",
    "+ in this short review , we summarize the status of theoretical predictions for signal and background processes at hadron colliders .",
    "readers who are interested in more details should refer to several reviews in the literature , for example  @xcite .",
    "depending on the higgs boson mass , different decay channels open up as shown in fig .",

    "several processes have been considered : higgs production in association with a vector boson ( w / z ) with the vector boson decaying into two jets , vector boson fusion production in which the two jets coming from the proton and antiproton tend to have a large rapidity value , and gluon fusion production .",
    "this decay is , for the first time , included in the tevatron combined results shown in  @xcite .",
    "+   + @xmath24 : with increasing mass , the higgs boson decays preferably to the heaviest particles , mainly to @xmath25 and zz pairs around their thresholds ( br @xmath26 around @xmath27 gev for the ww ) . in the range @xmath28 gev ,",
    "the @xmath29 decay is the most important . because of the missing energy",

    "the charged leptons , however , have a strong angular correlation . +   +",
    "radiative corrections of the strong and electroweak interactions at nlo were calculated for the higgs boson decay @xmath30 with semi - leptonic or hadronic four - fermion final states in  @xcite , whereas the pure leptonic final state was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak corrections are similar for all four - fermion final states and reach @xmath31 at @xmath32gev .",

    "nlo predictions were consistently combined with soft - gluon resummation that is valid at small transverse momenta of the ww pair  @xcite , whereas for zz , soft - gluon effects on signal and background were studied recently in  @xcite .",

    "+ the @xmath44 leptons decay is the ` golden channel ' for observing a higgs boson as a clear peak on top of a smooth background  @xcite .",
    "its branching ratio is roughly half the one for the w - pair as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : smhproddec ] .",
    "the advantage of this channel over the ww one , is that the invariant mass of the leptons can be reconstructed , allowing a measurement of the background from the data .",

    "the @xmath40 term is known as an expansion in @xmath49 from the work of  @xcite .",

    "the difference between the exact and the approximate nlo cross sections is less than @xmath54 for higgs masses up to @xmath55 gev , and does not exceed @xmath23 even for higgs masses up to @xmath56  tev , well far away from its formal range of validity @xmath57 . in equation  ( [ lag ] ) , @xmath58 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , @xmath59  gev , and @xmath60 is the wilson coefficient , currently known through @xmath61  @xcite . in this large @xmath62 limit ,",
    "the nnlo qcd corrections were computed in  @xcite , leading to an additional increase of the cross section of roughly @xmath63 , and showing a good convergence of the perturbative series .",

    "a further increase in the cross section of about @xmath64 was obtained by doing soft - gluon resummation  @xcite .",
    "this result was nicely confirmed through the leading soft contributions at @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "taking all the perturbative effects into account , the inclusive result of the cross section increases by a factor of @xmath66 at lhc and @xmath67 at tevatron . the theoretical uncertainty from effects beyond nnlo is estimated to be about @xmath68 by varying the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "+   + the largeness of the k - factors at both colliders is an open question . in  @xcite",

    "a resummation of these terms using soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) leads to smaller values of the k - factors ; in fact at the lhc , the k - factor for small values of @xmath71 is close to @xmath56 .",
    "+   + the importance and success in taming the qcd corrections to higgs production have shifted attention to electroweak corrections to the higgs signal .",

    "these terms are not suppressed by light - quark yukawa couplings , and receive a multiplicity enhancement from summing over the quarks .",
    "a careful study of the full 2-loop electroweak effects was performed in ref .",
    "they increase the leading - order cross section by up to @xmath74 for relevant higgs masses .",
    "the leading order of the mixed qcd - electroweak corrections , due to diagrams containing light quarks , was calculated in  @xcite , using an effective field theory approach where the w boson is integrated out .",
    "sample diagrams involved in this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3loop ] ) .",
    "this work allowed to check the complete factorization hypothesis of qcd and electroweak corrections proposed in ref .",
    "the result shows that , despite the large violation of the factorization assumption , a significant numerical difference from the prediction of this hypothesis is not observed in the cross section , due to the dominant qcd corrections .",
    "the end effect on the cross section is an additional enhancement of up to @xmath64 from the @xmath75 terms . +   + in addition to the previous results , the authors of  @xcite provided a new prediction for the inclusive cross section of the gluon fusion process .",
    "this updated result takes into account all the new theoretical calculations : the 2-loop light - quark diagrams based on the complex - mass scheme for the @xmath72- and @xmath73-bosons  @xcite , the new 3-loop @xmath76 correction , the contributions from top and bottom quarks with the exact nlo k - factors and the newest parton distribution functions ( pdf ) by the mstw group  @xcite .",

    "we note that similar results were obtained in  @xcite .",

    "refer to the inclusive cross section , which means no experimental cuts were imposed .",
    "it was shown in a previous work  @xcite that the impact of higher order corrections on the rate and shape of the corresponding distributions may be strongly dependent on the chosen cuts .",
    "the most general higher order prediction for gluon fusion process is available on the form of partonic nnlo monte carlo programs  @xcite which use the large-@xmath62 limit and vanishing b - quark mass . in  @xcite , the authors have shown that , while for the process @xmath80 , radiative corrections are only slightly affected by the signal cuts , the process @xmath81 is strongly affected by these cuts which take away most of the increase observed in the inclusive cross section .",
    "the numbers in tables table  ( [ tab : kfactors ] ) and table  ( [ tab : davatzcuts ] ) reflect that .",
    "this process is important for the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc for a wide range of higgs masses  @xcite .",
    "the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) cross section is one order of magnitude lower than the one for gluon fusion , but it is an attractive channel for measurements of the higgs couplings and cp properties  @xcite . in vbf , the higgs is produced in association with two jets which are scattered into the forward direction .",
    "these two jets are not color connected at lo , which means that the hadronic activity in the rapidity region between these two jets is very small . on the other hand ,",

    "the vbf process suffers from a large background .",
    "the dominant one when trying to isolate the @xmath86 and @xmath87 couplings through vbf is the higgs production plus two jets from gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the lo contribution to this background is known keeping the full top - mass dependence  @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that the vbf cuts on the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the tagging jets work efficiently in this case .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath88 in the large top quark mass limit are also known  @xcite , as well as parton shower effects on the azimuthal angle correlation of the two jets and the rapidity distribution of extra jets  @xcite .",
