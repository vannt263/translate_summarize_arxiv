    "cellular patterns occur frequently in nature , such as cells in biological tissues , crystalline grains in polycrystals , grain aggregates in colloidal materials , and bubbles in a pint of beer . among cellular patterns ,",
    "the dynamical behaviors of epithelial tissues have received much attention in the study of morphogenesis in developmental biology as well as in biophysics and soft matter physics @xcite .",
    "it is because they provide a firm interdisciplinary field to explore the various biological , chemical , and physical properties of the cellular materials with autonomous characters and collective behaviors .",
    "however , even the phenomena linked to the mechanical properties of tissue , such as cell boundary shortening , cell division , cell rearrangement , and cell disappearance from the tissue , are highly complex , with thousands of different molecules structured and orchestrated in a very intricate way . by contrast , it is widely recognized that the apical side of the cell - cell junction ( aj ) , such as the adherens junction , of monolayered epithelial tissue forms a two - dimensional elastic network , and the aj network appears approximately as a polygonal cellular pattern on the two - dimensional surface @xcite .",
    "in addition , an elastic , possibly visco - elastic - plastic , network containing the aj network likely plays an essential role in the mechanical and dynamical properties of cell movement in the epithelial tissues .",
    "therefore , dynamical and geometrical models would describe certain aspects of various phenomena in epithelial tissues .",
    "experimental observations indicate that some cell boundaries of epithelial tissue have smooth nonzero curvatures that can not be well approximated by a polygonal pattern with straight boundaries @xcite ( fig .",

    "[ fig : olfactory](b ) ) , and swollen cell species in other epithelial tissues @xcite , require precise treatment of the curvatures for their precise descriptions",
    ". in hela cells @xcite , cortical tension and pressures generally increase by substantial amounts during mitotic cell rounding and play important roles in the phenomenon .",
    "therefore , a dynamical and geometrical model with curvatures may provide a firm theoretical background to explore such various morphologies and dynamical behaviors in epithelial tissues .",
    "an optimal model would feature better precision for curvatures and cell internal pressure and be extendable to various biochemical interactions for its applications .    in order to theoretically describe two - dimensionally packed cells in epithelial tissues ,",
    "there have been developed several types of geometrical models @xcite , such as the vertex model @xcite , the finite element model @xcite , the cell - centered model @xcite , and the cellular potts model ( an extended potts model ) @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the vertex model is the first and simplest to be generalized with curvatures .",
    "the finite element model partitions polygonal cells into pieces so that the cell boundaries are likely to be piece - wised but otherwise behaves like the vertex model .",
    "the cell - centered model is based on the voronoi diagram created from the centers of the cells , whose boundaries are secondary objects and are mostly ignored .",
    "the cellular potts model is defined on a fine lattice in which the shapes of the cell boundaries are , in general , arbitrarily pixelated by definition .",
    "thus , the latter three families of models do not fit naively with the simplest view of smoothly curved cell boundaries .",
    "the vertex model for cells was first proposed by honda @xcite and is a mechanical network model of tricellular junctions in which the junctions are simplified to `` fictitious '' vertices .",
    "therefore , if one constructs a model of cell boundaries with curvatures , which we intend to construct here , it can be easily merged with the vertex model .",
    "note that a straightforward simplification of biological imaging data is to assign the data to the cell boundaries and the individual cells , which matches the parameters of the vertex model quite naively .",
    "in addition , some integral membrane proteins bind tricellular junctions , forming the tricellular tight junctions @xcite . the formation of these junctions might support the validity of the `` fictitious '' vertices in the vertex model .    of relevance to the problem of modeling the curvatures of cell boundaries",
    "is the young - laplace law @xcite , which is a fundamental law in the physics of densely packed dry foams @xcite .",
    "the law represents the force balance along the cell boundary and equates the pressure difference between the neighboring cells and the tension of the boundary in its normal direction .",
    "the law is applicable to any kind of cell boundaries of the cellular materials if such forces are acting on them and their bending rigidity is negligible relative to the size of the cell boundaries . due to the thinness of the plasma membrane and the flexibility of the cortical actin fibers",
    ", it would also be legitimate in our case .",
    "the law dictates the behaviors and the accuracy of the pressures are essential for the curvatures and vice versa , if the pressures depend on the curvatures through the cell areas .",
    "previous studies have not adequately addressed pressures , and curvatures have even been omitted through the polygonal approximations of the geometrical models for epithelial tissues .",
    "apart from the cellular potts model , which we exclude from our current consideration of the curvature model , no study has attempted to capture non - straight cell boundaries in geometrical models for epithelial tissues , and studies of simpler cellular materials for general purposes have been limited @xcite . in a straightforward and computer - friendly approach ,",
    "`` virtual '' vertices were inserted in the interior of the cell boundaries , which may be classified as a version of the finite element method .",
    "a superior example of this approach is the computer program surface evolver @xcite , which is a very general and powerful tool to find the minimal surface in arbitrary dimensions that can even be equipped with an arbitrary riemannian metric .",
    "in contrast to its generality , the surface evolver minimizes the surface energy rather than simulating its dynamics . in another attempt ,",
    "similar `` virtual '' vertices were introduced with the associated local curvatures .",
    "such a model has been constructed by reducing the dissipative equation of motion for two - dimensional grain growth @xcite , and for three - dimensional cellular pattern growth @xcite .",
    "the local curvatures appear in the potential force for the virtual vertices and shift them according to the boundary tension .",
    "both attempts are strong candidates for application to epithelial tissues , however , if the dynamics in question fits to their scopes .    during development , for example",
    ", the dynamics of epithelial tissues feature slow movements of the cells in hours and days , and even during the rapid change in curvature that occurs during mitosis , cell divisions are performed in approximately half an hour . by contrast ,",
    "laser ablation experiments of cell boundaries imply that the initial forces along the cell boundaries can be released within a second @xcite .",
    "this rapid release indicates that the curvatures are the `` fast '' variables while the cellular positions are the `` slow '' variables .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom for the curvatures are effectively suppressed for the cellular dynamics of the epithelial sheet . therefore ,",
    "the optimal means of addressing cellular dynamics is to treat the curvatures mostly in a static way and to increase the accuracy of the geometrical description of the tissues via the young - laplace law , which we will attempt here .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to construct a two - dimensional geometrical and dynamical model of the univariant curvatures of cell boundaries and the tricellular junctions to serve as a tool for investigating the various dynamical phenomena of epithelial tissues with greater accuracy .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the variables are , therefore , equal to the number of the boundaries and twice that of the vertex positions .",
    "to apply the young - laplace law , a general form of the potential energy is proposed as a function of the curvatures and the vertex positions .",
    "the generalization also offers a clear physical interpretation of the energy and a variety of mechanical responses of the cells , which will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : target area ] and [ sec : discussions ] . from the energy , cell pressures and tensions",
    "are defined in a physically and mathematically sound manner , and appear in the law as a consequence of the `` fast '' curvature variables .",
    "thereafter , the dynamics is formulated by the dissipative equations of motion for the vertex positions with some topological changes called t1 and t2 @xcite , while the curvatures are determined by the law .",
    "because the law emerges as a set of non - linear equations , we present a numerical algorithm with the method of steepest descent for the determination of the curvatures .    during the construction of the model ,",
    "the buckling effects of the cell boundaries are neglected , and we introduce the artifact of the upper and lower bounds of the curvatures to avoid further and sometimes unnatural complications in simulation . if we allow an extreme initial configuration and infinitely large circular cell boundaries , the model admits many overlapping boundaries ; otherwise , boundary collisions should be treated carefully with the buckling effects .",
    "the latter requires a precise treatment of the elastic nature of the cell areas and the nonuniform curvatures , which would require elliptic integrals to express .",
    "these considerably complicate the construction and are beyond the scope of this manuscript .",
    "the form of the energy contains linear surface tensions and osmotic pressures in addition to the conventional terms in the vertex models , and thus the area part of the energy may permit a longer relaxation time of the largely deformed area compared to the conventional one .",
    "this form might match the slow movement of the deformed cells around the healed wound mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we omit angular energies in the form of the energy due to a lack of its clear physical correspondence .",
    "the model enables us to describe the dynamics of two - dimensional epithelial sheets with rounded cell shapes .",
    "most notably , the model further admits two - vertex or two - sided cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig : olfactory](b ) ) to appear , which can not even exist in the conventional vertex models .",
    "we demonstrate such dynamics by simulation in section [ sec : examples ] , and give a brief comparison with an experimental observation .",
    "the simulation is performed for a few hundred packed cells with a boundary with the free boundary condition .",
    "we also provide further discussions and comments on the model , its possible extensions , and its applications in the final section .",
    "this section consists of three parts : the preliminary part , the construction of the dynamical model , which we call the bubbly vertex dynamics , and some examples of simulation based on the model .        in @xcite , the young - laplace law or equation",
    "is formulated in the context of physics to explain the equilibrium shape of the interface between two media that exert their capillary pressures onto the interface . denoting the pressure difference by @xmath1 and the unit vector normal to the surface by @xmath2 ,",
    "the local form of the young - laplace law can be expressed as - t & = & p , [ def:3dyl ] where @xmath3 is the positive tension along the interface and @xmath4 is the differential operator on the coordinate system of the interface .",
    "thus , if the interface is two - dimensional , the derivative along @xmath2 contributes nothing , and @xmath5 amounts to twice the mean curvature of the interface .",
    "the law is frequently used in models of grain growth and soap froths @xcite . an important remark on eq .",
    "( [ def:3dyl ] ) is that positive tension is assumed because otherwise the interface is buckled or even shuffled if the two media are in liquid phase .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : yl ] , in two dimensions with a uniform @xmath3 along the one - dimensional interface , the above can be simplified to     along the one - dimensional interface with the curvature radius @xmath6 is balanced by the pressure difference @xmath7.,width=151 ]    & = & p_- p_. we specify the pressures of the media @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the radius of the uniform curvature and is positive , assuming @xmath12 .",
    "if we consider a tricellular junction at its force equilibrium , there arise three equations from the law : & = & p_i - p_i+1 , where adjacent cell boundaries are labeled as @xmath13 and the @xmath14-th boundary partitions the region @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the identification : region @xmath16 @xmath17 region @xmath18 . summing the above three equations yields _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 = 0 .",
    "[ eq : triyl ] therefore , at the force equilibrium , there is a relationship between the tensions and the curvatures , in addition to the direct force balance equation at the junction .",
    "although we do not intend to utilize the above in the rest of the manuscript , this would be a very useful and important relationship , for instance , when one wants to infer the forces from images @xcite .",
    "note that an equivalent equation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : triyl ] ) in the case of foams is given in @xcite , and that the law is also mentioned in the context of vertex models in @xcite .",
    "the vertex model for cells in tissues was first proposed by honda in his seminal paper @xcite as the boundary shortening model in two dimensions , which finds the minimum of the total boundary length for a given network of vertices .",
    "the model has subsequently been developed with various terms and formulations that fall roughly into two families .",
    "one includes equations of motion for vertices focusing on its dynamics , while the other deals with the ensemble of the network configurations energetically , for example , by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the former is sometimes referred to as the `` vertex dynamics '' , while the latter is simply referred to as the vertex model . rather than exhaustively listing these models",
    ", we mention some of them below .",
    "nagai et al . formulated the vertex dynamics with a set of deterministic and dissipative equations of motion @xcite .",
    "weliky and oster developed it with the two - dimensional osmotic pressure and the hookean spring term for the cell perimeter @xcite .",
    "various extensions to three - dimensional cases have also been presented @xcite .",
    "farhadifar et al . and staple et al .",
    "basically used the latter energetic treatment to define the model and performed ground - state analysis for an extensive set of model parameters @xcite .",
    "marinari et al . adapted monte carlo simulations of the vertices for tissue overcrowding @xcite . in either family of the models",
    ", there are mainly three building blocks : the polygonal approximation of a given cellular pattern , the potential energy function to characterize the tissue , and the transition rules for the network configurations , including the dynamical equations and computer algorithms .",
    "the polygonal approximation lets the geometrical features of the tissue be a graph of vertices and edges in which vertices represent the multicellular junctions and edges represent the cell boundaries .",
    "the edges are defined as straight lines , and in most cases , each vertex is assumed to be connected only to three edges ( the law of plateau in dry foams @xcite ) .",
    "we call it the degree of the vertex is three .",
    "let us label the two - dimensional position of the @xmath14-th vertex by @xmath19 .",
    "the original potential energy proposed in @xcite is merely the sum of the cell boundary lengths .",
    "it has been subsequently developed and extended to various directions , and one of the most accepted and frequently used forms of the energy for epithelial tissues is that described in @xcite : [ def : evdm ] e(\\{_i } ) = _",
    "< i , j > _ ij l_ij + _ l_^2 + _ ( a_- a_^0 ) ^2 , where @xmath20 are vertices and @xmath8 specifies a cell .",
    "@xmath21 is a constant , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are non - negative constants .",
    "@xmath24 represents the length of the cell boundary and , consequently , the distance between the @xmath14-th and the @xmath25-th vertices .",
    "@xmath26 is the area of the cell @xmath8 , while @xmath27 is its target area , or the preferred area .",
    "the first summation is over the connected neighbors .",
    "the third term , `` area constraint '' , is introduced as `` a mechanism that makes the size of the cells uniform '' in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the vertex positions are given by _",
    "for a given initial configuration of @xmath28 , the vertices move dissipatively , thereby obeying the above equations .",
    "certain topological changes of the vertex graph are observed in epithelial tissues .",
    "the main contributions are the recombination of the vertices and the cell disappearance from the surface .",
    "we discuss their details in section [ sec : topological changes ]    as is often the case with the vertex models , we assume the tensions along the cell boundaries are all non - negative in the following sections .",
    "our construction seems to have a room to admit negative tensions , but non - uniform curvatures should be introduced to describe the buckling , which we neglect in the manuscript .",
    "this section is devoted to the construction of our model and describes the energy function , the target area , the energy minimization , the equations of motion , the determination of the curvatures by the young - laplace law , and the topological changes to be completed .",
    "some technical notes and proofs of our claims are provided in the appendices . before going into the construction",
    ", we would like to introduce four assumptions , three of which are quite often implied in the vertex models .",
    "first , the degrees of the vertices are all three , unless otherwise stated . in the manuscript",
    ", we omit the vertices with degree two which can represent the corners of the tissue boundaries , although these vertices can be added in a straightforward manner . as for the vertices with degree greater than three , they are of importance as the multicellular rosette structure @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , they can not clearly be distinguished from a collection of vertices with degree three connected by short edges .",
    "therefore , it is assumed that these vertices can be well approximated by the vertices with degree three , and these vertices are thus be neglected . as suggested in @xcite , vertices with degree greater than three are energetically unstable in many cases due to the state of the infinitesimally separated vertices with degree three , which lowers the energy .",
    "this situation is also implied in the assumption .",
    "second , non - negative tension is assumed on the cell boundaries so that no buckling occurs .",
    "third , the energy function is composed of the edge lengths and the cell areas only .",
    "we simply neglect other possibilities such as boundary bending energies , angular energies , and chemical potentials . the buckling effect and",
    "the bending stiffness require nonuniform curvatures of the boundaries , while the chemical potentials require other information than the mechanical properties of the tissues .",
    "these phenomena are beyond the current scope of constructing a dynamical and geometrical model with smooth and uniform curvatures .    finally , we address an additional assumption for epithelial tissues : the dynamical degrees of freedom of the curvatures are negligible as the fast variables .",
    "this assumption allows us to focus on the slow dynamics of the vertex positions .",
    "we dictate more on this in section [ sec : minimisation ] .      emphasizing the local pressures of cells and the curvatures of cell boundaries ,",
    "let us propose the bubbly vertex dynamics ( bvd ) model , which is inspired by the soap froths models @xcite and the vertex models initiated by honda @xcite .",
    "namely , each cell has a unique hydrostatic pressure , and each cell boundary has a unique curvature resulting from the mechanical properties of the boundary and the surrounding pressures , as in the young - laplace law . because a curvature of a boundary is introduced as such , the length of the boundary is no longer the distance between two ends , but is given by the curvature .",
    "similarly , the area of a cell depends on the curvatures surrounding it . to formulate a curvature model with a mechanical vertex network ,",
    "let us first suppose a general form of the ( potential ) energy function and deduce the cell pressures , the young - laplace law , and the equations of motion of the vertices in later sections .",
    "let @xmath29 be the positions of the vertices , _",
    "i.e. _ , the junctions of the cell boundaries , and @xmath30 be the radii of the curvatures of the cell boundaries .",

    "@xmath26 is the area of the cell @xmath8 , and @xmath36 are non - negative numbers exclusive to each other that may depend on the height of the cell for epithelial tissues @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 is the so - called `` target area '' in the quadratic form of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath38 is the surface element of the cell @xmath8 for the integration of the osmotic pressure @xmath39 , whose functional form should be given according to the conditions and the situations one considers .",
    "we will propose an explicit form of the osmotic pressure later in eq .",
    "( [ def : osmo ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 is the pressure of the outer region of the tissue , if there is a boundary of the tissue .",
    "one can easily extend this to the multiple boundary case by adding corresponding similar terms to the above .    with the above radius @xmath41 of the curvature",

    "one can remove this bound by using different parameterizations of the lengths and the angles , and consider larger deformations of the edges . here",
    ", we will not consider such deformations in search of states with moderate deformations relaxing into ( quasi- ) equilibrium .",
    "note that the saturation could be interpreted as a sudden increase in the bending energy or some ratchet - like mechanism of its element .",
    "additional notes and comments on the bound will be given in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "let us return to the form of the energy function ( [ def : e ] ) .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ def : e ] ) can be described as the `` line tension '' but we introduce this as a consequence of the combination of the cell - cell adhesion , the line tension , and the natural lengths of the hookean springs .",
    "namely , the second term is a hookean spring term , assuming that an actin - filament - like elastic structure is associated with the cell boundary .",
    "the third term is also hookean but of the `` cortical tension '' or the `` contraction ring '' @xcite .",
    "the linear term in @xmath26 with the coupling @xmath52 describes the surface tension , which we also assume as a two - dimensional homogeneous elastic network of the actin - filament - like structure in the apical side of the cell .",
    "the term with the coupling @xmath53 is the `` area constraint '' introduced by nagai and honda as the mechanism that makes the sizes of the cells uniform @xcite . as stated , the couplings @xmath36 are exclusive to each other because their non - zero values can be united into a single quadratic form by square completion of the linear and quadratic terms in @xmath26 .",
    "although this quadratic `` effective '' term is used frequently in the literature , we will mostly omit this by setting @xmath54 in what follows .",
    "in fact , we suggest that this term can effectively be reproduced by the linear term in @xmath26 and the osmotic pressure",
    ". this will be explained in the following section in more detail .",
    "note that it may be possible to unify the second , third , and fourth ( bracketed ) terms because they all imply the existence of the elastic body on the apical side of the cell .",
    "however , we do not know such a unified form and therefore keep these terms separate .",
    "the integration of the osmotic pressure can be performed from some arbitrary but constant referential area to the value of @xmath26 .",
    "later , we will actually choose a different referential area in the case of @xmath54 .",
    "last , the contribution of the external pressure is added , as is usual in physics .",
    "we have not specified the explicit form of the osmotic pressure @xmath55 because it truly depends on the situation that the user of our model intends to realize .",
    "in addition , this two - dimensional osmotic pressure is not literally the same as the three - dimensional one .",
    "it is an isotropic force per unit length acting on the aj boundaries and can be , for example , the swelling force of the actin gel , as indicated in @xcite , or a projection of the three - dimensional osmotic pressure or another , unspecified isotropic contribution . here , we call it the osmotic pressure and propose the following form , which is inspired by a simple and conventional form of such pressure in chemical thermodynamics : , where @xmath56 is the activity coefficient of the solvent , @xmath57 is the mole fraction of the solvent , and @xmath58 is its molar volume ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is the gas constant and @xmath3 is the temperature . in our two - dimensional case",

    "note that from an energetic or dynamical point of view , we only need to specify the dependence of the pressures on the curvatures .",
    "in fact , the above specifies it as a function of the area and therefore as a composite function of the curvatures in the given way .",
    "in this section , we focus on the area part of the energy and define the target area such that it gives the minimum of the area part . during this derivation",
    ", one can confirm that the combination of the surface energy and the osmotic pressure gives the same analytic behavior around the minimum as that given by the `` area constraint '' .",

    "the minimization of the energy can be accomplished by the vanishing virtual work done by arbitrary changes in the variables , that is , @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , the potential part of the lagrangian is sufficient for our purpose because we only need to clarify the force equilibrium at the edges . because of",
    "the decomposition ( [ def : eael ] ) of the energy , the variation of the energy can be given by the variations of @xmath26 and @xmath85 : e & = & -_p_a_+ _",

    "the numbering of the edges by a single capital letter is introduced , while the orientation of the edges is implied by the convention of the sign of the curvatures .",
    "note that the variation of the energy is given primarily by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the functions of them .",
    "the sum over the cell numbering @xmath8 can be distributed to the one over the edge numbering by the resummation formula ( [ formula : resummation ] ) shown in appendix [ app : pda ] : e & = & _ i , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the cells to the left and right of the edge @xmath94 , respectively .",

    "the variations of the curvatures are only contained in the first term , and thus the minimization of the energy , @xmath98 , in terms of the curvatures requires the vanishing coefficients of the first term and yields the following young - laplace law for each edge : [ def : yllaw ] & = & p__i - p__i . as in the derivation ,",
    "the tension may take a negative value .",
    "however , by considering the buckling effect in the absence of the bending rigidity , we exclude such a situation from our current consideration , as will be briefly mentioned again in the determination of the curvatures . in the force equilibrium along the edges , the variation of the energy can be much simplified by substituting the young - laplace law into eq .",

    "this fact will be reflected in the derivation of the eoms in the following section .",
    "although the variation of the energy takes the derived form in general , there arises a different form of @xmath83 in the case with the saturated curvatures .",
    "in such a case , the saturation behaves as the constraint that prevents the curvature from canceling the pressure difference along the edge . in terms of the variation of the energy , this can be viewed as an excess energy over the young - laplace law .",
    "when the @xmath94-th edge is saturated , @xmath99 , and consequently , @xmath100 .",
    "this yields the following relationship at the saturation : |r_i| = , r_i l_i^(0 ) = l_i^(0 ) r_i .",
    "accordingly , the variation of the edge length @xmath85 takes a different form for saturated @xmath101 : l_i & = & 2 r_i _",
    "i = l_i^(0 ) = l_i^(0 ) . therefore ,",

    "the first term takes the same form as that for the unsaturated edges , whereas the second term shows the excess energy and its corresponding force .",
    "the excess force pushes the relevant vertices toward the direction in which the edge becomes isotropically swollen . as such , in spite of the artifact of the saturation bounds for the curvatures , the resulting excess force arises in a mechanically sound manner and is energetically consistent with the possible interpretations mentioned in section [ sec : energy ] .",
    "the rather conventional form of the eoms of the vertex positions as the governing equations of the dynamics are defined as follows .",
    "equating the friction terms and the potential forces leads to the following : [ def : eoms ] _",
    "the left side of the equation is the friction , while the right side is the potential force .",
    "the coefficient @xmath102 is the friction coefficient for the vertex @xmath14 , and the variable @xmath103 is introduced as a referential position to the vertex @xmath14 .",
    "the noise term is suppressed for convenience , and the inertial terms are neglected , as stated previously . precisely speaking ,",
    "the friction term should be of the relative positions or of the relative velocities to the surface or the environment to which the friction is actually occurring . in a biological context ,",
    "the friction term is dependent on the conditions under which the experiments are conducted .",
    "for example , if the epithelial cells are attached to some firm substrate , then @xmath103 should be given mostly by the position of the substrate .",
    "under such a condition , they all take nearly the same constant and are therefore negligible as the zero vector . by contrast , if the cells are freely movable to in the surrounding medium , then @xmath103 is supposed to be some effective position of the surroundings , which may be given by an averaged quantity of the neighboring cell positions in a sophisticated way . for simplicity , in the following we consider the former case , @xmath104 , with a common friction coefficient @xmath105 .",
    "note that , once the system reaches equilibrium , we do not need to consider the difference due to the vanishing frictions , although the vanishing frictions do not necessarily compensate the equivalent equilibrium states in both cases .",
    "the eoms ( [ def : eoms ] ) appear formally identical for other existing vertex models @xcite . however , the explicit form of the above is quite distinct in our case , mainly due to the presence of the curvatures . in the other models ,",
    "edges behave mechanically as elastic but rigid objects , such that the internal pressure of a cell directly pushes the vertex positions of the cell . in our model , in the absence of the rigidity , the pressure pushes the edge and bends it until the pressure is balanced with the tension along the edge .",
    "thus , the pressure exerts its force onto the vertices only through the tension . this can be clearly seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltae - yl ] ) , and the potential forces can be accounted for solely by the tensions .",
    "in fact , the potential forces are derived by differentiating the energy in terms of the vertex positions : [ def : pot force ] - & = & _ i t_i ( _ i - _ i ) . because only three edges connect to a vertex , the summation is over the three edges , each of which amounts to a tension toward the direction the edge is connected to . substituting the potential forces ( [ def : pot force ] ) into the eoms ( [ def : eoms ] ) with @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ", it leads to [ eq : eoms ] & = & _ i t_i ( _ i - _ i )",
    ". the explicit form of the tension can be written by [ def : t ] [ eq : t ] t_i = _",

    "that is , @xmath109 is an @xmath85-independent combination , as is the factor @xmath108 .",
    "because the length of the edge satisfies the inequality , @xmath110 , the assumption of the non - negative tension can be read as @xmath111 .    in the case with the saturated curvatures ,",
    "we follow the same approach . substituting the coefficients in eq .",

    "it follows that the equations of motion take the form ( [ eq : eoms ] ) , with the vertex positions as the only remaining dynamical variables .",
    "thus , in our current formalism , the curvatures are determined at any time @xmath114 by the law for the given set of the model parameters and the positions @xmath115 . on the other hand , the values of the curvatures",
    "are required for the explicit form of the eoms because it is clear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) that the tensions in the eoms depend on the values of the curvatures . therefore , to complete the basic construction of the dynamics , we must clearly describe how the law determines the curvatures for the given set of the parameters and the vertex positions .",
    "first , we must confess that there is no known method , in general , to obtain the analytic forms of the curvatures as the exact solutions of the young - laplace equations ( [ def : yllaw ] ) .",
    "the curvatures or radii of the curvatures appear nonlinearly in the definitions ( [ def : l ] ) of the lengths and areas and , therefore , in the tensions and pressures as well .",
    "accordingly , the young - laplace equations emerge as a set of non - linear equations for the curvatures whose number equals the number of edges . for @xmath116 vertices , @xmath117 edges , and @xmath118 cells ,",
    "euler s formula states @xmath119 , and vertices with degree three mean @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , @xmath117 amounts to n_e = 3 ( n_c - 1 ) .",
    "the number of equations is approximately threefold that of the number of cells . from this practical circumstance and the aforementioned nonlinearity",
    ", we infer that there is no means of finding a solution in a rigorous way or even assuring the existence of a solution .    instead of searching for an exact solution",
    ", we intend to find a numerical solution of the young - laplace equations , assuming that a solution exists .",
    "our tactics is as follows . in the equational form of the law ( [ def : yllaw ] ) , we unite both sides of the equations into one form as a set of the functions of the curvatures : @xmath121 , for @xmath94 being the edge number , [ def : ylfunc ] g_i & & - ( p__i - p__i ) .",
    "the suffixes @xmath92 and @xmath93 represent the cells to the left and right of the edge @xmath94",

    "thus , the law is rewritten as @xmath122 , and the problem of finding the solution is redefined by that of finding the simultaneous zeroes of @xmath121 .",
    "investigating the analytic behaviors of the functions with respect to the curvatures , we propose an optimization algorithm of the squared sum of the functions to find the numerical solution .",
    "the algorithm constitutes the method of steepest descent and a simple collection of the bisection methods , the latter of which is only occasionally used to complement the former .",
    "note that some modification to the definitions of the functions will be introduced due to the presence of the bounds of the curvatures .",

    "@xmath112 is the jacobian matrix as a matrix - valued function of @xmath128 such that @xmath161 .",
    "there is an important note and a modification of the above expression because we have modified the functions in eq .",

    "in addition , the discontinuously saturated edge should also be discontinuously saturated when @xmath163 is infinitesimally changed because the original form of @xmath135 is analytic .",

    "finally , we would like to remark that there are a variety of numerical methods to solve a set of non - linear equations . among them , the newton - raphson method , a.k.a .",
    "newton s method , prevails due to its ease of use and the speed of convergence .",

    "in fact , we have confirmed that newton s method does not always reduce @xmath152 .",
    "another candidate is the conjugate gradient method , which uses the previous search .",
    "this method is quite adequate when the method of steepest descent hardly pushes @xmath152 toward zero but may require far more computational effort than the method of steepest descent .",
    "epithelial tissues , or a collection of dry foams , undergo various types of topological changes during their dynamical processes , including cell rearrangements , cell apoptosis or extrusions , cell divisions ( or coalescence in foams ) , and transformations of a vertex with degree @xmath166 to one with different degree .",
    "these changes are of great importance for the mechanical nature of the tissues , _",
    "i.e. _ , their viscoelastic and plastic nature , particularly under deformations or in morphogenesis .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the topological changes and how to implement them in our model to finalize our construction .",
    "to be precise , we deal with the processes regarding the cell rearrangements , cell disappearances ( or apoptoses ) , and cell divisions .",
    "as stated previously , the transformations of vertices with different degrees are suppressed by our current setting in which the degrees of the vertices are all three .    in two - dimensional vertex models , the cell rearrangements and the cell disappearances can be described by means of the so - called t1 and t2 topological changes @xcite .",
    "namely , when a cell boundary shrinks , recombination of the vertices may occur , and the cells may exchange their neighbors around the cell boundary . this topological change is called t1 ( fig .",

    "the t1 topological change involves curved edges . because t1 occurs at a fairly short edge",
    ", we first keep the curvatures of the other edges intact and recalculate them after the recombination .",
    "the t2 change notably differentiates our model from other existing vertex models .",
    "a t2 process lets a cell disappear from the geometry such that the cell either dies or is extruded from .",
    "if we scrutinize the disappearance process in time , t1 precedes t2 as a reduction of the vertices of the cell up to the minimum number of edges , and t2 finalizes the disappearance as in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2 ] . in the polygonal models , triangle has the minimum number of edges , so it is sufficient to define the t2 process by disappearing triangular cells .",
    "however , in our model , two - vertex cell has the minimum number of vertices .",
    "therefore , our t2 topological process , or t2 process , should be given by the disappearance of a two - vertex cell as in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2 ] .",
    "there are a variety of ways to implement these processes in simulation .",
    "the simplest method is to introduce certain thresholds for the processes below which the topological changes are forced to occur .",

    "some thresholds below which the energies of the relevant topologies should be compared would also be needed for the latter method . in the next section ,",

    "we introduce the threshold of the distance @xmath167 of two connected vertices , below which the t1 process is forced to occur .",
    "in addition , another threshold length @xmath168 is introduced such that if the distance between two vertices of a two - vertex cell decreases below the threshold , the cell disappears .",
    "note that , in the t1 process , a cell boundary is replaced by a newly created boundary with the new curvature variable that is to be fixed immediately .",
    "the easiest method is to apply the bisection method to the new curvature because the process represents infinitesimal changes in a pair of vertex positions , and the surrounding pressures and tensions will not change significantly .",
    "however , we fully solve the curvatures numerically in the following section .    in biological experiments , cell division is closely related to tissue growth .",
    "divisions are accompanied by cell growth ( in area in two dimensions ) , and the division planes might be strongly correlated with themselves or the tissue environment .",
    "thus , the mechanisms of the divisions should be contemplated with this information .",
    "the division itself can be realized simply by adding an edge and a pair of vertices to divide the cell , which changes the variable set of the energy function and , consequently , the energy itself .",
    "therefore even if the division is due only to biological processes , the process is immediately followed by the dynamical relaxation process of the changed energy , which is usually uplifted by the division .",
    "therefore , for example , the division plane will be immediately slanted according to the energy landscape .    as explained above",
    ", there could be a number of different ways to implement the cell division .",
    "for example , all cells might grow subject to constantly increasing target areas , then divide themselves when they exceed some threshold area .",
    "alternatively , a cell might divide if it is elongated enough along its longest axis so that the tissue retains some uniformity in cell size and shape , up to some extent . in the next section ,",
    "we adopt another method by introducing cell cycles for each cell with some randomness .",
    "the cell cycle prescribes the schedule of the cell life , including cell growth in area and cell division . for our model ,",
    "an increase in the tension of the division plane is also introduced immediately after the emergence of the division plane , to model the mitotic cell rounding of the eukaryotic cells @xcite .        in this section ,",
    "we present four examples of the proposed model obtained by computer simulation .",
    "the geometry is commonly set to a two - dimensional flat surface with a boundary , which is topologically equivalent to a disk .",
    "no particular boundary condition is imposed onto the boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is the free boundary condition with the constant pressure of the outer region of the tissue : @xmath169 . no other external force is applied .",
    "this means that there are no specific conditions for vertex positions and velocities at the boundary of the tissue , and they obey the same eoms as in the bulk .",
    "the initial numbers of cells , vertices , and edges are set as [ eq : nums ] n_c = 217 , n_v = 432 , n_e = 648 .",
    "the initial configuration of the vertex positions is generated from a voronoi diagram obtained from randomly distributed voronoi centers in a regular hexagon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] ) . for the generation of the graph with degree three",
    ", the corners of the hexagon are removed , and their adjacent edges are united .",
    "then , the initial value of @xmath128 in @xmath134 is first generated by a simple collection of the bisection methods for individual edges and is reduced by the method of steepest descent as in fig .",

    "the threshold for the t1 process is also introduced by : _",
    "1 = 0.01 , whereas @xmath168 for the t2 is omitted .",

    "when either of these criteria are satisfied , the iterative calculation is aborted , and the final value of @xmath128 is taken as an approximate solution . the maximum number of iterations is set to @xmath180 , and the precision is set to @xmath181 .",
    "note that the maximum and minimum of the possible values of @xmath152 are completely dependent on the set of the model parameters and the configuration at that moment .",

    "the result implies that the state at the mechanical equilibrium obeys the so - called lewis law @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the pressure is a monotonically increasing function of the cell area .",

    "the second example presents another time course of the system in which cell division is scheduled by the cell cycle ( fig .",

    "the cell cycle consists of approximately three phases : the resting phase ( @xmath191-phase ) , interphase ( @xmath94-phase ) , and mitosis ( @xmath192-phase ) .",
    "the resting phase practically means the cell is not dividing , and therefore we do not need to specify any particular parameters for such cells . during interphase ,",

    "a peanut shape appears after the cytoplasmic division at @xmath194.,width=321 ]    the cell volume growth in the first stage is realized by the increase in the coefficient @xmath61 from @xmath195 to @xmath196 , which inevitably increases the target area ( [ def : target area ] ) by the same magnitude .",
    "the coefficient of the cortical tension @xmath34 is increased by a factor of @xmath197 during the growth to make the cell round .",
    "thus , increased pressure and tension are relaxed back to the original values in the third stage .",
    "this elaborated cell cycle can in fact demonstrate the mitotic cell rounding and a peanut shape @xcite after the division in fig .",

    "the model parameters are chosen to be @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , while others are the same as in the previous example , with the exception of the division - related parameter changes .",
    "the shared edge of the daughter cells has the increased parameters @xmath203 , @xmath204 at the finalizing stage of cytokinesis .    in the final examples , as a in - silico realization of the two - vertex cell which can be observed in mouse olfactory epithelium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : olfactory](b ) ) , we demonstrate the emergence of a two - vertex cell in figs .",

    "then , gradually reducing the coefficient of the osmotic pressure from @xmath206 to @xmath207 , the cortical tension is increased by @xmath208 , and the adhesive interactions between major and minor cells are switched on in terms of the coefficient @xmath32 of the constant tension : [ eq : adhesion ] _ m , m = 0.12 , _",

    "the dominant type of cells carries the same parameters as in ( [ eq : params ] ) .",
    "the simplest and most naive implementation of adhesion is given by the constant shift of the tension because the adhesion is realized by the trans - bonded cadherins @xcite and the reduction of the tension is given by its concentration in three dimensions @xcite .",

    "this result seems to suggest that the increased cortical tension and interactions are necessary for the small cell to be a two - vertex cell .",
    "however , in a given particular configuration , not only those parameters but also the reduced target area of the cells is orchestrated for the emergence . therefore , only some of the necessary conditions can be implied .",
    "note that we have not found any two - vertex cell for the cases with only two types of @xmath77 .",
    "for the two - vertex cell to exist , the cell must have a sufficiently small target area to fit in a longer edge of larger cells .",
    "in addition , for stability , a simple physical consideration indicates that the edges connected to the two vertices of the cell are of the hookean spring , whose tensions increase as the edges elongate . for , any small perturbation to the equilibrated vertices will be pulled back if the relevant edges are as such .",
    "we are presently unable to state a general condition for the creation of two - vertex cells .",
    "instead , we show the situation , partially inspired by the model for metastasis @xcite , in which the repulsive interaction effectively pushes a three - vertex cell of the minor type to the interior of an edge and creates a two - vertex cell as shown in fig . [",

    "in this paper , we have proposed and constructed the bvd , or the bubbly vertex dynamics model , as a two - dimensional geometrical and dynamical model of curved cell boundaries and ( tri- ) cellular junctions for monolayered epithelial tissues . as fundamental ingredients of the model , the curvatures of the cell boundaries are present and enable us to realize bubbly behaviors of the cellular dynamics , such as mitotic cell rounding and swollen cell species in epithelial tissues .",
    "the model of the curvatures has been formulated with a vertex model and the generalized form ( [ def : e ] ) of the potential energy , where the target area arises naturally from other fundamental properties of the cells .",
    "the generalized form provides its clear physical interpretation and a variety of mechanical responses of the cells . at the characteristic time scale of epithelial tissues ,",
    "the curvatures are treated in a static way , and the young - laplace law emerges naturally . to determine the curvatures ,",
    "the young - laplace function is analyzed , which reveals that the curvatures are uniquely determined under certain simple circumstances . to finalize the construction , the topological changes are manifested as t1 , t2 , and the cell division , while t2 is redefined as t2 for the bvd . finally , in section [ sec : examples",
    "] , some examples by simulation have been presented , including a typical time course of the bvd , a realization of the mitotic cell rounding , and the emergence of the two - vertex cell , which could not be realized in the conventional vertex models .",

    "in the second example , the cell cycle is introduced , and the peanut shape @xcite is naturally produced as a consequence of the mitotic cell rounding and division plane shortening .",
    "finally , a pair of particular cases are given for the emergence of the two - vertex cell whose conditions are expected to be related to the swollen cell species in epithelial tissues @xcite .",
    "in generalizing the potential energy , we have distinguished two typical settings for the area part of the energy , that is , the `` area constraint '' setting ( ac setting : @xmath220 ) and the osmotic pressure setting ( os setting : @xmath54 ) .",
    "although they share the same behavior near the minimum of @xmath74 , they behave differently upon the application of some external force . starting from the initial configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] with the parameters ( [ eq : params ] ) and @xmath79 , we have tested the two conventional vertex models of the ac and os settings .",
    "our results confirm that the ac case collapses through a chain of t2 processes , while the os case resists against the external pressure and evolves rather normally . on the other hand ,",
    "the ac with @xmath221 maintains an area similar to that of the os . in the bvd",
    ", the ac setting gives pressure differences that are too large to yield well - defined initial curvatures for the random initial configuration , and thus the ac setting should be excluded from the bvd for general investigations .",
    "because the vertex models have been extensively tested and partially validated in the literature , many properties of the system realized by the bvd should not be substantially different from those of the vertex models , as long as any particular condition is imposed . to illustrate this similarity",
    ", we have tested ten random initial configurations of @xmath222 cells in a hexagon as in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] and report that the resulting populations of @xmath166-sided cells and the relaxation time of the energy are similar in the three models : the ac vertex model with @xmath221 , the os vertex model , and the bvd of the os setting , while other parameters are homogeneously given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : params ] ) .",
    "all of the models exhibit a tendency toward hexagonal packing and approximately obey the lewis law .",
    "as mentioned above , a clear difference between the vertex models and the bvd may arise in the forces acting on the cellular junctions because the pressures directly move the vertices in the former while only the tensions move them in the bvd .",
    "therefore , if the curvatures and the pressure differences are not negligible , the resulting dynamics must be different at least locally .",
    "however , due to a lack of a clear manifestation of such a difference other than cell shapes , we have only demonstrated a local topological difference in the mitotic cell rounding and the emergence of the two - vertex cell in the examples .",
    "there are a few methods which quantitatively characterize patterns , for example , by particle image velocimetry ( piv ) @xcite or by the texture matrix @xcite .",
    "these methods might describe the difference between the bvd and other geometrical models .",
    "however , piv and the matrices neglect the details of the cell boundaries such as the curvatures and thus would be unable to fully characterize the bvd .    before discussing the applicability of the model",
    ", we will discuss the assumptions and the limitations of our construction .",
    "their removals will lead to some possible extensions of the model .    on the degree of the vertices",
    ", we can relax the assumption to include vertices with degree two , which are the virtual vertices in the interior of the edges .",
    "these vertices at the boundary of the tissue can characterize different boundaries with different boundary conditions , enabling the attachment of the tissue to a firm material or the application of external forces through the boundary .",
    "this is a very useful tool for mechanical in silico experiments . the vertices with degree greater than three can achieve more complex structures , including the rosette structure @xcite .",
    "practically speaking , future studies should examine those vertices with degree four for their applicability to achieve the desired phenomena .",
    "we have assumed non - negative tension primarily to prevent the buckling of the cell boundaries .",
    "one can include the buckling with the vertices with degree two , but this may yield multiple solutions of the law ( [ def : yllaw ] ) for numerical calculations .",
    "we have excluded the bending energy , the angular energy , and the chemical potential .",
    "the bending rigidity of the cell boundary is considered negligible relative to the size of the cell boundaries .",
    "however , the bending rigidity may acquire non - negligible magnitude if the actomyosin complex accumulates to extraordinary levels at some edge or some other stiffer cytoskeleton is attached to the cell boundary . to generalize our model for such situations ,",
    "the curvatures should be replaced by some elliptic integrals to express the edges @xcite .",
    "this generalization is also capable of dealing with both the buckling effect and the collisions of the cell boundaries , and thus represents an interesting direction of study .",
    "while the implementation of the angular energy is relatively easy , we leave this possibility for those who consider it necessary around the cellular junctions .",
    "we have not included the chemical potential to focus on the pure mechanical properties of the tissues .",
    "it would be intriguing to consider chemical reactions and environment of several types of adhesive proteins , such as cadherins and nectins , or edge - related proteins such as actin fibers and myosins .",
    "such studies would represent the next step for the application of the model to the real phenomena in tissues .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of the curvatures can be recovered if we replace the evaluation function @xmath152 with the energy @xmath223 .",
    "the method of steepest descent for a step at a time is equivalent to euler s method for the dynamics of curvatures .",
    "unfortunately , the information needed to determine the friction term of the curvature is not available .",
    "if one knows or is able to infer this information , the extension of the current construction is straightforward .",
    "alternatively , the surface evolver @xcite or kawasaki s model @xcite with elaborate friction coefficients and energy might be more appropriate for the simulation of the dynamical curvatures .",
    "any of the above three methods would serve as novel tools to investigate the dynamics of epithelial tissues with frequently changing cell boundaries or rapidly changing tensions .",
    "the saturation bounds of the edges have been introduced so that the overlapping or colliding edges are mostly avoided . however , even with the bounds , a random initial configuration with overlapping edges occasionally occurs .",
    "therefore , it would be ideal to remove the bounds and introduce the cell boundary collision instead .",
    "the removal of the bounds also requires another parameterization of the curved edges , because the shape of the edge becomes a double - valued function of the curvature radius in the case without the bounds .",
    "this generalization may be related to that for the bending energy if we treat the cell area as an elastic body , and would be an ambitious future work .",
    "in addition to the possible extensions related to the assumptions and limitations , there are a variety of other possibilities for the model .",
    "for example , one may ask how the model can be generalized to three - dimensional cases .",
    "if we assume the young - laplace law and a uniform tension for a cell boundary , then we can assign a single mean curvature to the cell boundary .",
    "therefore , the simplest and most naive extension would result in solving the boundary problems of the cell boundaries for given mean curvatures , uniform tensions , and vertex positions .",
    "achieving this solution is not at all trivial and would be a meaningful direction for the generalization of this model .",
    "another interesting direction is the simulation methods .",
    "the model can be applied to a monte - carlo simulation by replacing the dynamical portion with the metropolis - hastings algorithm or to an event - driven simulation with energy minimization @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the construction and possible extensions of our model rather than restricting our discussion to a complete characterization of bvd . for this characterization",
    ", it would be intriguing to investigate the effect of the nonzero value of the buffering area @xmath62 .",
    "its presence would be critical when the external force or the pressure differences are large enough to push neighboring cells out of the plane through t2. the latter condition may arise when the cell divisions or local tissue growth dominantly determine the tissue dynamics , as suggested in @xcite as the `` cell competition '' .",
    "second , the ground state of the system has not been fully investigated in the bvd . in @xcite , the ground state of the vertex model with the energy ( [ def : evdm ] ) is analyzed based on the stability analysis of a single polygonal cell .",
    "unfortunately , in our model , the cells do not take simple polygonal shapes in general , and we can not expect the validity of the single - cell analysis . therefore , the ground - state analysis should be generalized first from that in @xcite for the bvd and its `` phase '' diagram .",
    "third , stochastic noise and the referential position may be taken into account in the eoms ( [ def : eoms ] ) .",
    "the vertices are the `` fictitious '' physical objects , and we are therefore hesitant to implement the noise in the naive way .",
    "we infer that the noise should be attributed to the mechanical properties of the tissue rather than directly to the eoms , as the annealing procedure in @xcite .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the nonzero referential position @xmath103 . because the position as an averaged quantity of the neighborhoods can be interpreted as a finite expression of the viscous property of the tissue",
    ", it will lead to nontrivial differences in tissue dynamics , as suggested for wound healing in @xcite and three - dimensional tubular formation in @xcite .    in principle , our model can be extended in the same manner that the vertex models have been extended , and is applicable to all of their applications , ranging from fundamental studies on packing and patterns to in silico experiments such as laser ablations and growing tissues .",
    "in particular , in silico experiments with external forces would be interesting because the forces acting on the vertices differ between the bvd and the vertex models .",
    "we anticipate that an extensive simulation study of bvd would reveal some critical differences with other geometrical models .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the bvd can be applied to tissues with highly curved cells , such as mouse auditory @xcite or olfactory epithelia , or drosophila retinal epithelia , as long as the two - dimensional description of these tissues is acceptable .",
    "the arrangement of the different cell species or , for short , the cell sorting in these epithelia is likely to be deeply related to the relevant gene expressions and mechanically associated proteins , such as adhesive proteins , elastic proteins of actomyosin complexes , and their regulators .",
    "therefore , for such applications , the model must be equipped with relevant biochemical reactions and interactions .",
    "another type of application is the cell competition ; shraiman proposed in @xcite that cell death in the competition may be controlled by local differences in growth rates .",
    "the difference is equivalent to the pressure difference in his description , and our model is one of the best discrete models to describe this difference .",
    "these are all exciting phenomena for application of the bvd .",

    "<S> in order to describe two - dimensionally packed cells in epithelial tissues both mathematically and physically , there have been developed several sorts of geometrical models , such as the vertex model , the finite element model , the cell - centered model , the cellular potts model . </S>",
    "<S> so far , in any case , pressures have not neatly been dealt with and the curvatures of the cell boundaries have been even omitted through their approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on these quantities and formulate them in the vertex model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a model with the curvatures is constructed , and its algorithm for simulation is provided . the possible extensions and applications of this model will also be discussed . </S>"
