    "bidimensionality theory was introduced by demaine et al . in @xcite .",
    "this theory is build on cornerstone theorems from graph minors theory of robertson and seymour @xcite and initially it was developed to unify and extend subexponential fixed - parameter algorithms for np - hard graph problems to a broad range of graphs including planar graphs , map graphs , bounded - genus graphs and graphs excluding any fixed graph as a minor @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the problem is bidimensional if the solution value for the problem on a @xmath1-grid is @xmath2 , and contraction / removal of edges does not increase solution value .",
    "many natural problems are bidimensional , including dominating set , feedback vertex set , edge dominating set , vertex cover , @xmath3-dominating set , connected dominating set , cycle packing , connected vertex cover , graph metric tsp , and many others .",
    "the second application of bidimensionality was given by demaine and hajiaghayi in @xcite , where it have been shown that bidimensionality is a useful theory not only in the design of fast fixed - parameter algorithms but also in the design of fast ptass .",
    "demaine and hajiaghayi established a link between parameterized and approximation algorithms by proving that every bidimensional problem satisfying some simple separation properties has a ptas on planar graphs and other classes of sparse graphs .",
    "see also @xcite for further development of the applications of bidimensionality in the theory of eptass we refer to the surveys  @xcite for further information on bidimensionality and its applications , as well as the book @xcite .    in this work we give the third application of bidimensionality_kernelization_. kernelization",
    "can be seen as the strategy of analyzing preprocessing or data reduction heuristics from a parameterized complexity perspective . parameterized complexity introduced by downey and fellows is basically a two - dimensional generalization of `` p vs. np '' where in addition to the overall input size @xmath4 , one studies the effects on computational complexity of a secondary measurement that captures additional relevant information .",
    "this additional information can be , for example , solution size or a structural restriction on the input distribution considered , such as the treewidth of an input graph .",
    "the secondary information is quantified by a positive integer @xmath5 and is called the _",
    "parameter_. parameterization can be deployed in many different ways ; for general background on the theory see @xcite .",
    "a parameterized problem with a parameter @xmath5 is said to admit a _ polynomial kernel _ if there is a polynomial time algorithm ( the degree of polynomial is independent of @xmath5 ) , called a _ kernelization _ algorithm , that reduces the input instance down to an instance with size bounded by a polynomial @xmath6 in @xmath5 , while preserving the answer .",
    "kernelization has been extensively studied in parameterized complexity , resulting in polynomial kernels for a variety of problems .",
    "notable examples of known kernels are a @xmath7-sized vertex kernel for vertex cover  @xcite , a @xmath8 kernel for dominating set on planar graphs  @xcite , which later was improved to a @xmath9 kernel  @xcite , or an @xmath10 kernel for feedback vertex set  @xcite parameterized by the solution size .",
    "one of the most intensively studied directions in kernelization is the study of problems on planar graphs and other classes of sparse graphs .",
    "this study was initiated by alber et al .",
    "@xcite who gave the first linear - sized kernel for the dominating set problem on planar graphs . the work of alber et al .",
    "@xcite triggered an explosion of papers on kernelization , and kernels of linear sizes were obtained for a variety of parameterized problems on planar graphs including connected vertex cover , minimum edge dominating set , maximum triangle packing , efficient edge dominating set , induced matching , full - degree spanning tree , feedback vertex set , cycle packing , and connected dominating set @xcite .",
    "we refer to the surveys  @xcite as well as the recent textbook @xcite for a detailed treatment of the area of kernelization .",
    "since most of the problems known to have polynomial kernels on planar graphs are bidimensional , the existence of links between bidimensionality and kernelization was conjectured and left as an open problem in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that every bidimensional problem with a simple separation property , which is a weaker property than the one required in the framework of demaine and hajiaghayi for ptass @xcite and which is expressible in the language of counting monadic second order logic ( cmso ) ( we postpone these definitions till the next section ) has a linear kernel on planar and even much more general classes of graphs . in this paper",

    "we refer to the full version of  @xcite , which is available as @xcite .",
    "bodlaender et al .",
    "have shown that every parameterized problem that has finite integer index and satisfies an additional surface - dependent property , called a quasi - coverability property , has a linear kernel on graphs of bounded genus .    the kernelization framework in @xcite",
    "is based on the following idea .",
    "suppose that every yes - instance of a given parameterized problem admits a protrusion decomposition .",
    "in other words , suppose that the vertex set of an input graph @xmath12 can be partitioned in sets @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of size linear in parameter @xmath5 , @xmath16 separates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and every set @xmath17 , @xmath20 , is a protrusion , i.e. induces a graph of constant treewidth with a constant number of neighbours in @xmath16 .",
    "then kernelization algorithm uses only one reduction rule , which is based on finite integer index properties of the problem in question , and replaces a protrusion with a protrusion of constant size .    in this paper",
    "we use exactly the same reduction rule as the one used in the kernelization algorithm given in @xcite for obtaining kernels on planar graphs and graphs of bounded genus .",
    "the novel technical contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we introduce the new way the kernel sizes for bidimensional problems are analyzed .",
    "the analysis of kernel sizes in   @xcite requires  topological \" decompositions of the given graph , in the sense that the partitioning of the graph into regions with small border , or protrusions , strongly depends on the embedding of a graph into a surface",
    ". then topological properties of embedding are used to prove the existence of a protrusion decomposition . while such an approach works well when we have a topological embedding it seems difficult to extend it to graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor .",
    "instead of taking the topological approach , we apply bidimensionality and suitable variants of the excluded grid theorem  @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", we show that bidimensionality and separability implies existence of a protrusion decomposition .",
    "this makes our arguments not only much more general but also considerably simpler than the analysis in  @xcite .",
    "our second technical contribution is the proof that every cmso - definiable separable problem has a finite integer index .",
    "pipelined with the framework from @xcite , these results imply the proof of theorem  [ thm : main_result_bidim ] .    the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelims ] , we provide definitions and notations used in the remaining part of the paper .",
