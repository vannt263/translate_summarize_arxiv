    "particles interacting by means of bounded and purely repulsive interaction potentials @xmath1 can form cluster crystals at sufficiently high densities @xcite . though the existence of clustering in the full absence of attractions might seem counterintuitive at first , its existence rests on solid mathematical and physical grounds and has also been amply demonstrated by means of detailed computer simulations @xcite .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of clustering is that the fourier transform of the interaction potential , @xmath2 , has negative parts . in this case , the properties of the system , both in the liquid and in the crystal phases , are largely determined by the position of the wavevector , @xmath3 , at which @xmath2 attains its most negative value and by the negative amplitude @xmath4 of the fourier spectrum of the potential there @xcite .",
    "the physical realizability of such potentials as _ effective interactions _ between suitably tailored macromolecules has been demonstrated for the case of amphiphilic dendrimers as well as ring polymers @xcite .    at moderate to high temperatures , the thermodynamics of the system",
    "is very accurately described by a mean - field density functional theory , which predicts , among other properties , that the lattice constant of the crystal is density - independent @xcite .",
    "this is brought about by the mechanism of occupying the crystal sites by a multiple number of particles @xmath5 which scales proportionally to the density of particles , @xmath6 , in the crystal . within this crystal ,",
    "the equilibrium dynamics of the particles is characterized by two kinds of processes : the first one , operating at short time scales , is determined by lattice oscillations . at the same time , there is incessant particle hopping between sites , which brings about an overall average occupancy @xmath5 per site .",
    "the latter process is activated , diffusive dynamics , which brings about a self - diffusion coefficient of the particles that scales as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the absolute temperature and @xmath9 is a coefficient that depends on the precise form of the interaction potential @xcite .    whereas the diffusive , long - time dynamics of the clustered crystals is by",
    "now well - understood due to a number of different studies , the phonon dynamics , which is the dominant one at very low temperatures , has not been analyzed in detail .",
    "similarly , whereas the phase behavior of the system at moderate to high temperatures is very thoroughly examined , little is known regarding the phase diagram of the system at very low temperatures . the analysis of the elementary excitations ( phonons ) in the cluster crystals opens a route to low - temperature thermodynamics as well , since it allows for the calculation of the free energy of the system on the basis of a harmonic lattice theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is precisely to calculate and analyze the phonon spectra of cluster crystals and to draw , on this basis , conclusions on the stability , dynamics and thermodynamics of these systems at low temperatures .",
    "we find that cluster crystals have very unusual , yet simple , phonon spectra , in which all optical modes are degenerate and the optical frequencies are independent of the wavenumber , rendering thereby these solids into perfect einstein crystals .",
    "further , we discover a cascade of mechanical instabilities in the system , initiated at the long - wavelength limit of the low - lying acoustical modes , which trigger an avalanche of isostructural phase transitions from crystals of occupancy @xmath5 to crystals of occupancy @xmath10 , whereby @xmath5 is an integer number .",
    "finally , we predict that the ( infinitely many ) density gaps associated with the isostructural transitions at @xmath0 gradually close up as @xmath8 grows and they terminate at critical points at low temperatures .    the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "the generalization to three dimensions is straightforward , where one obtains up to eight sublattice occupancies @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the corresponding overall occupancy of the lattice is a _ rational _ number : @xmath43 evidently , even this combinatorial freedom does not restore the general possibility of real ( i.e. , in general irrational ) @xmath5 numbers present for @xmath44 . for the concrete example of the interaction potential examined in the rest of the paper",

    "this compresses the system , causing the lattice constant to shrink .",
    "since the interaction potential contains a flat part at small separations , and in view of the fact that the restoring forces in the crystal come mainly from the nearest neighbors , at some threshold value of the shrinking lattice constant the restoring force will vanish , at least along one crystallographic direction ( in our case , along the nearest - neighbor vector ) .",
    "this signals the mechanical instability .",
    "now , _ the same _ argument carries over to a crystal of occupancy @xmath5 at @xmath5 times the threshold density of the single occupied crystal , since the two are copies of each other as far as the lattice constant is concerned and only the forces in the latter are @xmath5 times bigger than the ones in the former .",
    "if the restoring force in some direction of the single occupied crystal vanishes , it will also do so at the same direction for the @xmath5 occupied crystal .",
    "we see , therefore , that the whole cascade of isostructural transitions is a straightforward consequence of the transition from the single to the double occupancy , which can be seen as the strategy of the system to avoid the mechanical collapse .",
    "indeed , multiple occupancy allows the system to readjust its lattice constant and to arrange the particles in such a way that all restoring forces are nonvanishing , offering the solid stability against thermal fluctuations . the fact that the thermodynamic phase transitions preempt the mechanical ones is reassuring and in line with a number of other examples , in which a system undergoes a first - order transition that has an instability line deep in the region of the two - phase coexistence ( or even beyond it , as in our case ) .",
    "the existence of the instability , however , has implications on the nucleation rates of the multiply occupied crystals , since , as one approaches it , it becomes exceedingly difficult to maintain thermodynamically metastable crystals of the wrong occupancy , a feature that should drastically suppress the corresponding nucleation barriers .",
    "up to now our considerations were limited to @xmath0 and to mechanical equations of motion of the particles around their equilibrium positions . here",
    "we will reintroduce finite temperatures and calculate free energies and the ensuing phase diagrams that follow on the basis of phonon modes _",

    "let us now focus on the limit @xmath115 . here , the @xmath152 optical branches dominate over the three acoustical ones , so we ignore the latter in what follows , and we further make the approximation @xmath153 .",

    "( [ einstein : eq ] ) .",
    "the density enters there through the dependence of @xmath5 and the lattice vectors @xmath63 on @xmath6 . as discussed in length in sec .",
    "[ zerot : sec ] , at the limit @xmath115 considered here , the lattice constant can be taken as density independent , due to the approximate property @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly , we define the @xmath6-independent frequency @xmath158 , for which the set of lattice vectors @xmath63 is determined by the interparticle interaction _ alone _ and , in particular , by the property that the length of the shortest reciprocal lattice vector of the crystal coincides with @xmath3 , the wavenumber at which @xmath2 has its most negative amplitude @xcite .",
    "then , we have @xmath159 and its @xmath6-dependence comes exclusively through @xmath5 , for which we know that @xmath55 . gathering all the results together , introducing them into eq .",

    "the last term , @xmath162 , has no effect on the determination of phase boundaries ; it acts simply as a constant shift to the chemical potential , leaving the pressure invariant , thus it will be dropped in what follows .",

    "the qualification pertains to the fact that in writing down eq .",
    "( [ fren2:eq ] ) , the contributions from the phonons _ only _ have been taken into account .",
    "both the disturbances of the phonon spectra arising from imperfect crystals with nonuniform site occupancies and the entropy associated with hopping are _ not _ included in the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ fren2:eq ] ) .",
    "the first therm there simply gives the @xmath0 phase diagram with the phase coexistence regions discussed in sec .",
    "[ zerot : sec ] . the second term , seen as a function of @xmath6 , has curvature @xmath163 , thus it will act to narrow the width of the density gaps as temperature grows .",

    "[ isostructural : fig ] for a region of moderate values of the density and thus site occupation numbers . as anticipated above",
    ", the phonon contributions lead to a narrowing of the density gaps as temperature increases .",
    "nevertheless , the crystals of different occupancy remain distinct at all temperatures , as is natural for an approach that does not allow hopping and smooth adjustments of the lattice constant .",
    "the phonon - based phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ isostructural : fig ] must now be juxtaposed to the ` exact ' one , arising from density functional theory @xcite and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the full phase diagram is free of the coexistence regions between crystals of different occupancy , for temperatures at least as high as @xmath165 .",
    "evidently , all the contributions from hopping , inhomogeneous lattice site occupancy and anharmonicities , bring about the effect of ` washing out ' the step - like behavior of @xmath5 and thus eliminating the first - order phase transitions between crystals of different site occupancies at sufficiently high temperatures . on the other hand , at @xmath0 the density gaps and the transitions between such crystals are definitely present . whichever contribution hopping and anharmonicities have on the free energy , it can not simply eliminate the gaps present at @xmath0 for arbitrarily small temperatures .",
    "it follows that the only possibility to reconcile the low- and high - temperature properties of the model is to put forward the conjecture that the coexistence gaps between crystals of occupancy @xmath5 and crystals of occupancy @xmath48 must narrow down as @xmath8 grows and terminate at critical points .",
    "as there are infinitely many gaps at @xmath0 , it follows that the system must feature infinitely many , low-@xmath8 critical points at which the isostructural fcc - fcc transitions end .",
    "preliminary simulations seem to confirm this hypothesis @xcite , whereby the critical temperature @xmath166 has been estimated in the order of magnitude @xmath167 .    the isostructural fcc - to - fcc transitions and their termination at a critical point bear some similarities to the ones discovered , and extensively investigated , in the 1990s for hard - sphere systems with short - range attractive or repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "also in that case , two fcc - lattices with different values of the lattice constant were found to coexist at sufficiently low temperatures , the difference between the two gradually disappearing as the temperature grows .",
    "there are , however , a number of important differences .",
    "first , in the previous cases , the coexistence was not a ground - state feature , since it disappeared below the triple , fcc - fcc - gas temperature , to give its place to a usual , fcc - gas coexistence .",
    "second , the two crystals had the same occupancy there , unity , whereas here they are characterized by different values of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the systems at hand present _ infinitely many _ such regions of coexistence and corresponding critical temperatures , as opposed to a single one in previous models .",
    "we have investigated the ground states and the phonon spectra of cluster crystals formed by @xmath24-particles , finding a cascade of isostructural transitions and the emergence of these systems as realizations of einstein crystals .",
    "we have put forward the hypothesis that the systems display infinitely many , low - temperature critical points in which the fcc - fcc transitions terminate . the predictions made here",
    "hold quite generally for all @xmath24 potentials , _ provided _ there exist mutual , nonvanishing forces between the particles , so that the arguments presented in sec .",
    "[ zerot : sec ] hold .",
    "an important exception is the so - called penetrable sphere model ( psm ) @xcite , which is formally a gem with infinite exponent , and for which no forces act between the particles ; consequently , neither the ground state requires a vanishing force on each particle due to its neighbors nor is a harmonic expansion of the potential possible .",
    "for the psm , the low - temperature phase diagram features _ gradual _",
    "crossovers from low- to high - occupancy fcc - crystals instead @xcite .    finally , we comment on the possible limitations of our simplifying assumption that in any given solid at @xmath0 all sites have the same , integer occupancy @xmath5 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ zerot : sec ] , the occupancy can be at most a rational number . therefore ,",
    "even in full generality , isostructural transitions between rationally occupied crystals would appear  the rational numbers forming a discrete set , as opposed to the general , real occupancy found by density functional theory and simulation at moderate and high temperatures .",
    "it follows that the conclusions on the necessity to terminate the isostructural transitions at critical points remain unaffected .",
