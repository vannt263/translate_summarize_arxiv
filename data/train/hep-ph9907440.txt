    "<S> a simple picture of the constituent quark as a composite system of point - like partons is used to construct the unpolarized and polarized parton distributions by a convolution between constituent quark momentum distributions and constituent quark structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve good agreement with experiments in the unpolarized , as well as , in the polarized case . </S>",
    "<S> when our results are compared with similar calculations using non - composite constituent quarks , the accord with the experiments of the present scheme is impressive . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that dis data are consistent with a low energy scenario dominated by composite constituents of the nucleon .    at low energies , </S>",
    "<S> the so called naive quark model accounts for a large number of experimental observations . at large energies , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 sets the framework for an understanding of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) phenomena beyond the parton model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the perturbative approach to @xmath0 does not provide absolute values for the observables . </S>",
    "<S> the description based on the operator product expansion ( @xmath1 ) and the @xmath0 evolution requires the input of non - perturbative matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an approach which uses model calculations for the latter ingredients at a low , _ hadronic _ , scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in order to relate the constituent quark with the current partons of the theory , a procedure , hereafter called acmp , has been applied @xcite . within this approach , </S>",
    "<S> constituent quarks are effective particles made up of point - like partons ( current quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) , interacting by a residual interaction described as in a quark model . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron structure functions are obtained by a convolution of the constituent quark model wave function with the constituent quark structure function . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been recently used to successfully estimate the pion structure function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize here our application to the unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite dis off the nucleon . in our picture </S>",
    "<S> the constituent quarks are themselves complex objects whose structure functions are described by a set of functions @xmath2 that specify the number of point - like partons of type @xmath3 , which are present in the constituents of type @xmath4 with fraction @xmath5 of its total momentum @xcite . in general @xmath4 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 specify all the relevant quantum numbers of the partons , i.e. , flavor and spin . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss first the unpolarized case for the proton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the functions describing the nucleon parton distributions omitting spin degrees of freedom are expressed in terms of the independent @xmath6 and of the constituent probability distributions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , at the hadronic scale @xmath9 @xcite , as f(x,_0 ^ 2 ) = _ x^1 dz z [ u_0(z,_0 ^ 2)_uf ( , _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d_0(z,_0 ^ 2)_df(,_0 ^ 2 ) ] where @xmath10 labels the various partons , i.e. , valence quarks ( @xmath11 ) , sea quarks ( @xmath12 ) , sea antiquarks ( @xmath13 ) and gluons @xmath14 . the different types and functional forms of the structure functions for the constituent quarks are derived from three very natural assumptions @xcite : _ i ) _ the point - like partons are the quarks , antiquarks and gluons described by @xmath0 ; _ ii ) _ regge behavior for @xmath15 and duality ideas ; _ iii ) _ invariance under charge conjugation and isospin . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations define the following structure functions @xcite    _ qf(x , _ 0 ^ 2 ) = c_f x^a_f ( 1-x)^a-1  , [ csf1]where @xmath16 for the valence quarks , the sea and the gluons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> regge phenomenology suggests : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 meson exchange ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 exchange ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other ingredients of the formalism , i.e. , the probability distributions for each constituent quark , are defined according to the procedure of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our last assumption relates to the hadronic scale @xmath9 , i.e. , that at which the constituent quark structure is defined . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath21 gev@xmath22 , as defined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , namely by fixing the momentum carried by the various partons . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of the hadronic scale determines all the parameters except one , which is fixed through the data @xcite . to complete the process , </S>",
    "<S> the above input distributions are nlo - evolved in the dis scheme to the experimental scale , where they are compared with the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we next generalize our previous discussion to the polarized parton distributions . as it is explained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using @xmath23 ( spin - isospin ) symmetry and other reasonable simplifying assumptions , it can be shown that    f(x,_0 ^ 2 ) = _ x^1 [ u_0(z,_0 ^ 2 ) _ uf ( , _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d_0(z,_0 ^ 2)_df(,_0 ^ 2 ) ]  ,    where @xmath10 labels the various partons ; it means that the @xmath24 procedure can be extended to the polarized case just by introducing three additional structure functions for the constituent quarks : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in order to determine them we add two minimal assumptions : _ iv ) _ factorization : @xmath28 can not depend upon the quark model used ; _ v ) _ positivity : the constraint @xmath29 is saturated for @xmath30 . in such a way </S>",
    "<S> we determine completely the @xmath28 s . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath0 partonic picture , regge behavior and duality imply that _ q f = c_f x^- a_f ( 1-x)^a_f - 1 [ dcsf ] and @xmath31 , for all @xmath32 , as allowed by dominant exchange of the @xmath33 meson trajectory @xcite . moreover , the assumption that the positivity restriction is saturated for @xmath34 , in the spirit of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , implies that the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 have the same large @xmath5 behavior , and that @xmath37 , ( the latter being introduced in ( [ csf1 ] ) ) ; it means that the partons which carry all of the momentum also carry all of the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that the change between the polarized functions and the unpolarized ones comes only from regge behavior ; as a matter of fact , it turns out that , _ except for the exponent @xmath38 _ shown above , the @xmath28 s , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dcsf ] ) , are given by the unpolarized functions , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ csf1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other ingredients , i.e. , the polarized distributions for each constituent quark , are defined according to the procedure of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and they are shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the parton distributions at the hadronic scale are evolved to the experimental scale by performing a nlo evolution in the ab scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown in figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure function @xmath39 , calculated by means of the obtained distributions in the dis evolution scheme , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . we see that data are successfully described , the agreement becoming impressive when compared with that obtained by similar calculations with non - composite constituents .    taking into account the almost inexistent fit of parameters , the results are surprisingly good for both models @xcite . in particular the momentum distribution of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite seems to have been defined to fit the dis data , which is not the case . in the polarized case , </S>",
    "<S> it is found @xcite that the constituent structure functions eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dcsf ] ) give a good result for the proton , but they fail in reproducing the recent precise neutron data . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be ascribed to our naive input for the sea and to the symmetry for the @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been shown that , by redefining the sea @xmath28 , changing _ only one _ parameter so that the experimental sea polarization is recovered , also the neutron is rather well described . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 refers to this last scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we have traced back the remaining disagreement with the neutron data to the symmetric treatment of @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that a weak breaking of the su(6 ) symmetry in the quark model used @xcite and/or in the constituent quark structure functions improves considerably the agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron is extremely sensitive to small changes in the valence structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is also able to predict successfully several observables , such as the nucleon axial charges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that in this framework the _ spin crisis _ </S>",
    "<S> , as initially presented , does not arise .    since the method seems to be predictive , </S>",
    "<S> we are confident that it could be useful to phenomenologically estimate unmeasured quantities , such as the transversity parton distribution @xmath42 @xcite or off - forward quantities @xcite , which should be measured by the next generation of dis experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , low energy models seem to be consistent with dis data when a structure for the constituent is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial role played by the sea in the polarized case , as well as the implementation of chiral symmetry breaking in our procedure , have to be more deeply investigated </S>",
    "<S> . it will be the subject of future work . </S>"
