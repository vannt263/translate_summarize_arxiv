    "in tony guttmann s long and distinguished career the model of self - avoiding walks and how to analyse its behaviour has been a mainstay . since the early years @xcite to the present day @xcite",
    "tony has published more than 130 papers on self - avoiding walks , polygons and closely related models . at the same time",
    "tony has made many important and seminal contributions to the development of new methods for asymptotic analysis of power - series , chief amongst these the method of differential approximants @xcite .",
    "@xmath7-step self - avoiding walk _ ( saw ) @xmath8 on a regular lattice is a sequence of _ distinct _ vertices @xmath9 such that each vertex is a nearest neighbour of it predecessor .",
    "saw are considered distinct up to translations of the starting point @xmath10 . if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nearest - neighbours we can form a closed polygon @xmath7-step self - avoiding polygon ( sap ) by adding an edge between the two end - points .",
    "the fundamental problem is the calculation of the number of saw , @xmath12 , with @xmath7 steps . as most interesting combinatorial problems , saw have exponential growth . the generating function for saw ( and sap )",
    "is believed to have algebraic singularities , though in most cases this has not been proved .",
    "that is to say , the generating function is believed to behave as @xmath13 here @xmath14 is referred to as the _ critical amplitude , _ @xmath0 as the _ critical point , _ and @xmath15 as the _ critical exponent . _",
    "the value of @xmath16 is known exactly @xcite , though it remains to be proved rigorously . besides the physical singularity",
    "there is another singularity at @xmath17 @xcite which has a critical exponent consistent with the exact value @xmath18 .",
    "before one can say much about the behaviour of self - avoiding walks one must have something to work with so tony has pushed hard for major strides to be made in the development of new and improved algorithms @xcite for counting self - avoiding walks . and given that these counting problems are inherently of exponential time complexity tony and his co - workers have always been eager to make use of the latest progress in computing technology including being early adapters of massively parallel computations @xcite .",
    "the data for self - avoiding walks has been used to obtain very accurate numerical tests of analytic predictions originating from scaling theory , conformal field theory , stochastic loewner evolution , etc . @xcite . besides the already mentioned method of differential approximants the intricacies of the asymptotic behaviour of various walk problem",
    "has spurred tony s development of new methods for asymptotic analysis of power - series @xcite .",
    "the full self - avoiding walk model is well know to be a very tough problem with no immediate prospect of an exact solution .",
    "in fact tony used saw as a prime testing ground for ideas on how to determine whether or not a given model is solvable @xcite .",
    "tony has been an avid advocate for the utility of studying simpler exactly solvable problem both as an important and interesting pursuit in its own right and as a means of gaining further insight into the original harder problem .",
    "this work has resulted in many exact solutions to simpler ( often directed ) walk problems @xcite including one of the very few exact solutions for a 3d lattice model @xcite .",
    "one particular result vividly illustrates why the study of simple solvable lattice models can contribute in a major way to our understanding of more complicated problem . in a series of papers tony and co - workers demonstrated that the study of the simple model of staircase polygons could lead one to conjecture the area - perimeter scaling function for self - avoiding polygons @xcite . finally , we mention that tony has been involved in many research projects which have used self - avoiding walk to model many aspects of polymer physics and chemistry including steric stabilisation @xcite , modelling of vesicles @xcite , polymer collapse and interacting walks @xcite , polymer adsorption and desorption from a surface @xcite , force - induced polymer unfolding @xcite and desorption @xcite .",
    "so one can safely say that self - avoiding walks have been very good to tony and that tony has been exceptionally good for our understanding of the self - avoiding walk problem and its many and varied uses in the modelling of physical , chemical and biological systems .    in this paper",
    "we bring together two of tony s favourites and perform a new numerical analysis of the generating functions for the number of square lattice self - avoiding walks and some of their metric properties . from the numerical analysis",
    "( using differential approximants ) of the generating function for square lattice self - avoiding polygons we have obtained very accurate estimates for the critical point @xmath19 because every polygon has even length . ] and critical exponent @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , for square lattice saw there is an annoying ( at least to the author ) minor discrepancy between the above prediction for the exact values of the critical exponents and the estimates from series analysis where our best estimate using standard differential approximants @xmath21 is agonisingly close to the exact value @xmath22 .",
    "now no one would seriously take this minor discrepancy as an indication that the conjectured exact value is nt correct , rather it is a ` deficiency ' in the numerical analysis . in this paper",
    "we show how this discrepancy can be eliminated by the use of _ biased differential approximants_. with this new analysis we can confirm the value of the critical exponent to at least 8 significant digits .",
    "we also carry out a biased analysis of the generating functions for the metric properties ( end - to - end distance , monomer - to - end distance and radius of gyration ) that confirms to 7 digits accuracy that the size exponent @xmath6 .",
    "from the known exact solutions to various directed walk and polygon problems it is clear that the generating functions are often algebraic or given by the solution of simple linear ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "this observation ( originally made in the context of the ising model ) forms the nucleus of the method of _ differential approximants_. the basic idea is to approximate the function @xmath23 by solutions to differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",
    "the singular behaviour of such odes is a well known classical mathematics problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the singular points and exponents are easily calculated . even if the function _ globally _ is not a solution of a such a linear ode ( as is the case for saw ) one hopes that _ locally _ in the vicinity of the ( physical ) critical points the generating function can still be well approximated by a solution to a linear ode .",
    "a @xmath24th - order differential approximant ( da ) to a function @xmath23 is formed by representing the function by a @xmath24th - order ode ( possibly inhomogenous ) with polynomial coefficients such that @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are polynomials of degree @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and @xmath30 is the number of unknown coefficients . determining these coefficients such that ( [ eq : da ] ) is satisfied then amount to solving a system of linear equations .",
    "so we have that ( one ) of the formal power - series solutions to the ode agrees with the series expansion of the ( generally unknown ) function @xmath23 up to the first @xmath31 coefficients",
    ".    from the theory of odes , the singularities of @xmath23 are approximated by the roots , @xmath32 , of @xmath33 and the associated critical exponents @xmath34 are estimated from the indicial equation .",
    "the physical critical point @xmath0 is generally the singularity on the positive real axis closest to the origin . when the root at @xmath35 has order @xmath1 we can find the associated exponents by forming the indicial polynomial @xmath36_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath37_m = z(z-1)\\cdots ( z - m+1 ) , \\ , [ z]_0=1 $ ] . then if @xmath38 are the roots of @xmath39 the associated critical exponents have values @xmath40 .",
    "if there is only a single root at @xmath35 this is just @xmath41    by varying the degrees of the polynomials one can generate a large set of differential approximants to @xmath23 .",
    "each approximant yields values for @xmath0 and @xmath15 and by averaging over several ( often hundreds ) of these one can calculate estimates for these critical parameters ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch 8) for more details ) .",
    "we denote individual approximants by the notation @xmath42 $ ] case @xmath43 rather than a non - zero constant . ] . in general one",
    "focuses on so - called close to diagonal approximants where @xmath44 differ from @xmath45 by a small amount and one may typically use the restriction @xmath46 or 2 .",
    "if the critical point @xmath0 is known exactly ( or very accurately ) one may try to obtain improved numerical estimates for the exponents by forcing the differential equation ( [ eq : da ] ) to have a singular point at @xmath0 , that is one may look at _ biased differential approximants_. we have developed a new method in which we form biased approximants by multiplying the derivatives in ( [ eq : da ] ) by appropriate `` biasing polynomials '' .",
    "this allows us to bias in such a manner that the singularity at @xmath0 is of order @xmath47 .",
    "let    @xmath48    where @xmath49 .",
    "with this definition we have that @xmath50 , while subsequent lower order derivatives have `` biasing polynomials '' of degree decreasing in steps of 1 ( until 0 ) .",
    "this choice corresponds to assuming that the singularity is regular @xcite .",
    "then we form biased differential approximants ( bda ) such that @xmath51 one can readily generalise this to include further singularities at @xmath35 with the order of each given by @xmath52 and the singularity at @xmath35 need not be given by a monomial as above but could in general be given by the root of a polynomial @xmath53 with @xmath53 used as ( a factor in ) the `` biasing polynomial '' . for biased approximants",
    "@xmath42 $ ] still denotes a case in which the degree of the polynomial multiplying the @xmath54th derivative have degree @xmath28 such that the degrees of @xmath55 and the number of unknown coefficients is now @xmath56",
    "the critical point for square lattice self - avoiding walks is not know exactly but has been estimated to a high level of accuracy .",
    "series analysis of the self - avoiding polygon series @xcite yielded the estimate @xmath57 which recently has been improved by guttmann , jacobsen and scullard @xcite to @xmath58 and henceforth we shall adopt the value @xmath59 . as mentioned in the introduction numerical estimates for the saw critical exponent @xmath15 from un - biased das",
    "are close to the exact value but not quite on target .",
    "this means that square lattice saw should be the perfect model on which to test the efficacy of our new approach to biased differential approximants .",
    "the number of square lattice saw has been calculated up to length @xmath60 and the generating functions for the metric properties of saw up to length @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the critical exponent @xmath15 of square lattice saw as obtained from 3rd order differential approximants .",
    "the exponent estimates are plotted versus the number of terms @xmath31 used to form the da .",
    "the panels show the results from unbiased das ( @xmath62 ) and das biased to have a singularity at @xmath63 with the order of the root changing from @xmath64 to 3 . ]",
    "first we take a look at results obtained from 3rd order differential approximants both un - biased ( @xmath62 ) and biased with the order of the root at @xmath0 being @xmath65 and 3 .",
    "we generate lots of homogenous and inhomogenous @xmath66 approximants by varying @xmath67 from 8 to 20 and for each value of @xmath67 we generate all approximants with @xmath68 ( this amounts to more than 1600 approximants for each case ) .",
    "the smallest degree approximants thus utilise around 40 terms and the highest degree all 79 terms in the saw generating function . in we",
    "plot the resulting estimates of @xmath15 as s function of @xmath31 .",
    "the panel for @xmath62 ( un - biased case ) vividly illustrates the frustration the author has had in analysing this series .",
    "as can be seen the estimates exhibit a slow systematic drift as @xmath31 is increasing and ever so slowly they creep towards the exact value ( though one might question whether they would ever get there ) .",
    "now for @xmath64 the estimates get much closer to the exact value ( note the different scale on the @xmath69-axis ) , but again the approach is slow and not quite there yet .",
    "the explanation for this is fairly simple . if one looks at some individual approximants and calculate the roots of @xmath70 one finds a root that is very close to @xmath0 indicating that the series fells the presence of a confluent singularity at @xmath0 and that @xmath64 is therefore not sufficient biasing to pin down the critical behaviour .",
    "so we look to the @xmath71 and 3 cases and now we find a very good convergence of the estimates to the exact value .",
    "for large value of @xmath31 there is no discernible difference between the two cases but for low values of @xmath31 the @xmath72 biased approximants are superior .",
    "we also note that @xmath70 does not have a root close to @xmath0 when @xmath2 thus confirming that the biasing has successfully accounted for the critical behaviour .",
    ".[tab : gamma ] estimates for the critical exponent @xmath15 obtained from @xmath24th order biased differential approximants .",
    "we vary the order of the root at @xmath0 from @xmath64 to @xmath24 and that at @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . [ cols=\">,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next we perform a similar analysis but for the exponent @xmath76 at the singularity @xmath77 .",
    "the results for @xmath78 are listed in . as can be seen the exponent value @xmath79",
    "can be confirmed to at least 5 significant digits and there is no change in the estimates as one changes @xmath80 and @xmath1 ( even the @xmath62 case gives similar estimates ) .",
    "we note that an un - biased analysis gives @xmath81 , that is , an order of magnitude less accurate .",
    "estimates of the sub - dominant critical exponent for square lattice saw .",
    "the left panel is for @xmath82 and the right panel @xmath83 .",
    "the straight line corresponds to the value @xmath84 for the leading non - analytic correction to scaling exponent . ]",
    "finally , we address the question of estimating the sub - dominant exponents @xmath85 . the leading correction - to - scaling exponent is expected to have the exact value @xmath86 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the correction - to - scaling exponents for saw was estimated numerically and a detailed and careful analysis unequivocally confirmed that @xmath86 is correct . but",
    "can we confirm this value from a biased differential approximant analysis ?",
    "for @xmath2 there are @xmath1 exponent values at @xmath0 and one might hope that of these ( just the second exponent in the case @xmath71 ) will equal @xmath87 .",
    "shows the estimates for @xmath88 plotted versus @xmath31 in the cases of @xmath71 and @xmath78 and 4 .",
    "the straight line is the value @xmath89 and as can be seen the estimates are certainly consistent with this value for large enough @xmath31 . unfortunately that is all one can say .",
    "so biasing does not lead to an accurate estimate for @xmath90 .",
    "this does not change for higher values of @xmath1 where similar plots can be made ( the third and fourth exponents are of no use whatsoever ) .",
    "finally we analyse the generating functions for three metric properties .",
    "firstly @xmath91 the mean - square end - to - end distance of an @xmath7 step saw , secondly @xmath92 the mean - square distance of a monomer ( or vertex ) from the end - points and thirdly @xmath93 the mean - square radius of gyration of the monomers of the saw .",
    "precise definitions of the relevant quantities can be found in say @xcite .",
    "suffice to that these functions are expected to have the critical behaviour    @xmath94    where the factors under the sum ensure that the coefficients are integer valued . here",
    "@xmath95 is another critical exponent with value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the critical exponents for the metric properties of square lattice saw . in each case",
    "the estimates are obtained from 3rd order differential approximants . from left to right",
    "are unbiased estimates and then biased estimates with @xmath71 and 3 . from top to bottom are estimates to the generating function for the mean - square end - to - end distance , the mean - square monomer - to - end distance and the mean - square radius of gyration . ]",
    "displays results obtained from 3rd order differential approximants both un - biased ( @xmath96 ) and biased with the order of the root at @xmath0 being @xmath97 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the left - most panels which are for the un - biased case again vividly illustrates that traditional differential approximants can not quite reproduce the exact values of the critical exponents . as was the case for the saw generating function the estimates from the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath91 ( top panel ) and the mean - square monomer - to - end distance @xmath92 ( middle panel ) exhibit a slow systematic drift as @xmath31 is increasing and ever so slowly they approach the exact value .",
    "the estimates from the mean - square radius - of - gyration @xmath93 ( bottom panel ) are particularly ` poor ' and seem to settle at a value somewhat below the exact value .",
    "when we look at the @xmath97 and 3 biased approximants we find a very good convergence of the estimates from @xmath98 and @xmath99 to the exact exponent values ( note in particular the finer scale along the @xmath69-axis ) .",
    "for @xmath93 the estimates for large @xmath31 are now clearly consistent with the exact value but the scatter among the exponent estimates is quite pronounced and much larger than for the other two series .",

    "the data naturally confirm the qualitative observations made from but now in a quantitative manner .",
    "the estimates form un - biased approximants ( column 2 ) are systematically lower than the exact value with ` error - bounds ' that does not quite include the exact value . for the @xmath71 and 3 cases the estimates for @xmath91",
    "our estimate @xmath5 gives agreement with the exact exponent value @xmath6 to 7 digits and thus provide a high accuracy confirmation of the exact value .",
    "the estimates for @xmath92 are generally an order of magnitude less accurate but again confirm the exact values .",
    "finally , for @xmath93 we obtain estimates fully consistent with the exact value but now even less accurate .",
    "curiously , the estimates for the un - biased case appear to be more accurate ( as one can also confirm from ) , but this is quite clearly a ` false ' convergence .",
    "finally we calculated biased estimates for the exponents @xmath76 at @xmath73 .",
    "here we just quote results for @xmath78 and 4 and @xmath137 :    lll @xmath138 & @xmath139 & @xmath140 +   + @xmath92 & @xmath141 & @xmath142 +   + @xmath93 & @xmath143 & @xmath144    these estimates are clearly consistent with the exact values @xmath145 for @xmath91 , @xmath146 for @xmath92 and @xmath147 for @xmath93 .",
    "we made use of the fact that the critical point for square lattice self - avoiding walks is known very accurately to perform a numerical analysis of the saw series using a new method for biased differential approximants .",
    "our new method is a major advance since it permits us to bias a differential approximant such that is has a singularity of order @xmath1 ( up to the order of the underlying differential equation ) . from the analysis with @xmath2 we obtained exponent estimates in total agreement with the conjectured exact values",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath6 . in the case of the saw generating function",
    "our conservative estimate @xmath3 confirmed the exact value to at least 8 significant digits .",
    "this estimate is several orders of magnitude more accurate than the estimate from un - biased differential approximants and eliminates a long - standing minor discrepancy between exact and numerical results . in the case of the metric properties we obtain similar impressive estimates from the analysis of the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath91 where our estimate @xmath5 confirmed the value of @xmath95 to 7 significant digits .",
    "the results for @xmath92 was not quite so impressive being an order of magnitude less accurate .",
    "the only slightly peculiar case was @xmath93 where the un - biased estimates appears to to be quite accurate but wrongly gives an exponent estimate below the exact value while the biased estimates are consistent with the exact value but much less accurate .",
    "so in this case the biased exponents at least gives the correct answer which obviously is better than an accurate but wrong estimate .",
    "we also estimated the critical exponents @xmath76 at @xmath73 and found exponent consistent with the exact values @xmath145 for saw and @xmath91 , @xmath146 for @xmath92 and @xmath147 for @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we tried to estimate the leading non - analytic correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath90 from the biased exponent results when @xmath2 .",
    "we found results consistent with the exact conjectured value @xmath148 but somewhat disappointingly the estimates were not at all accurate .",
    "the new method of biased differential approximants that we have introduced is this paper promises to be very useful in obtaining accurate exponent estimates in cases where the critical point(s ) of a power - series is known exactly or very accurately .",
    "an obvious application is to various percolation series which have been notoriously difficult to analyse .",
    "an interesting question is whether the method can be used to ` reverse engineer ' more accurate estimates for critical points . in many cases ( particularly 2d systems ) critical exponents",
    "are known exactly but not so the critical points .",
    "would it be possible to obtain improved estimates for the critical point say by calculating biased estimates for critical exponents while varying the biasing value of @xmath0 .",
    "one might expect ( or at least hope ) that the biasing value of @xmath0 yielding an exponent estimate equal to the exact value should be very close to the true critical point .",
    "a preliminary trial run using the square lattice sap generating function confirmed the overall picture but did not give an improved estimate for @xmath0 .",
    "but that is hardly surprising given that the un - biased estimates for @xmath0 and @xmath149 are already extremely accurate .",
