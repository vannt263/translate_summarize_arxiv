    "precision measurements in neutron and nuclear decay offer a sensitive window to search for new physics beyond the standard electroweak model and allow also the determination of the fundamental weak vector coupling .",
    "recent analyses based on the effective field theory performed in e.g.  @xcite show that in processes involving the lightest quarks the neutron and nuclear decay will compete with experiments at highest energy accelerators .",
    "for instance , data taken at the lhc is currently probing these interactions at the @xmath0 level ( relative to the standard weak interactions ) , with the potential to reach the @xmath1 level . in some of the @xmath2 decay correlation measurements there are prospects to reach experimental sensitivities between @xmath3 and @xmath4 making these observables interesting probes for searches of new physics originating at tev scale .",
    "the most direct access to the exotic tensor interaction in @xmath2 decay is to measure the fierz term ( coefficient @xmath5 ) or the beta - neutrino correlation coefficient @xmath6 in a pure gamow - teller transition  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 coefficient shows up as a tiny energy dependent @xmath7 departure of the @xmath2 spectrum from its v - a ( standard model ) shape .",
    "the smallness of the potential @xmath5 contribution requires that other corrections to the spectrum shape of the same order are included in the analysis . indeed , according to  @xcite",
    "the recoil terms also affect the spectrum shape with their main contribution being proportional to @xmath8 . in order to disentangle these effects the detector efficiency for @xmath2 particle as a function of energy",
    "must be known with the precision better than @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the dominating contribution in the systematic uncertainty comes from back - scattering and out - scattering of electrons from the detector .",
    "monte carlo simulation of this effect is helpful , however , it introduces its own uncertainty as the input parameters are known with limited accuracy .",
    "monte carlo simulation would reflect the real situation better after it is adjusted to real experimental data of a particular measurement setup .",
    "the described in this article electronics was designed for a spectrometer capable of direct registration of the back - scattering events , thus providing reference data for the monte carlo calculation of the detector efficiency .",
    "the spectrometer itself is still in an r&d phase undergoing detailed tests and tuning .",
    "it will be a subject of a separate paper together with the performance benchmark  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", its concept will be described only in a minimum extent at the beginning of section 2 to explain the requirements imposed onto the front - end electronics and daq .",
    "the rest of section 2 is devoted to the electronic system architecture .",
    "the test results were obtained with a help of a signal generator and are presented in section 3 . therein the resulting time spectrum and the charge asymmetry distribution representing the typical performance",
    "are shown .",
    "the asymmetry spectra were obtained using a dedicated tester to simulate the hit position on the wire with adjustable resistance division ( potentiometer ) .",
    "conducting the electronic benchmark tests without a detector was chosen by purpose .",
    "the detector itself is still not fully understood .",
    "therefore it was important to assess the purely electronic contribution to the performance parameters of the spectrometer .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary and outlook for the future experiment .",
    "in order to facilitate the identification of the electrons impinging onto and scattered from the energy detector ( e.g. si detector , scintillator ) a low - z and low - mass tracker must be applied .",
    "one of the attractive options is a low pressure multi - wire drift chamber with minimum number of necessary wires in order to maximize the detector transparency .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled by a hexagonal wire geometry and the charge division technique allowing for a 3d track reconstruction without major distortion of the electron energy measurement .",
    "the hexagonal wire geometry is not the only one considered in the project .",
    "the rectangular ( planar ) wire configuration is the next suitable alternative .",
    "the multi - wire drift chamber is based on the small prototype described in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be operated with he / isobutan gas mixture ( ranging from 70%/30% to 90%/10% ) at lowered pressure ( down to 300 mbar ) .",
    "it consists of 10 sense wire planes ( 8 wires for each plane ) separated with 24 field wire planes forming the double f - f - s - f - f - s - f - f - s - f - f - s - f - f - s - f - f structure ( f- denotes a field wire plane , s- denotes a signal wire plane ) .",
    "the distance between neighboring signal planes is 15 mm , with wires within a plane being separated by 17.32 mm .",
    "this wire plane structure leads to the hexagonal cell geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ cells ] .",
    "each cell consists of a very thin anode wire ( nicr alloy , 25 @xmath9 m diameter ) with resistance of about 20 ohms / cm surrounded by 6 cathode field wires forming a hexagonal cuboid .",
    "all wires are soldered to pads of the printed circuit board ( pcb ) frames .",
    "the chamber is equipped with a two - dimensional positioning system for a beta source installed in the central region of the detector , between both parts of the mwdc structure . in the initial configuration , the electrons detected in two plastic scintillators installed at both sides of the mwdc",
    "provide the time reference signal for the drift time measurement .",
    "the pmt signals are also used as a trigger for the mwdc and electron energy detector readout .",
    "acquiring the drift time and the pulse height asymmetry at both ends of the responding signal wire one can establish the electron path across the chamber cell .",
    "the system provides charge - division position sensing in the direction parallel to the wires as well as precise drift time measurement .",
    "the expected position resolution across wires is limited by angular straggling of primary electrons travelling in the gas and accounts to about 450 @xmath9 m as shown in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the precision of the drift time measurement of about 200 ps is more than needed as it corresponds to about 50 @xmath9 m for the operating conditions in view .",
    "the mwdc will be operated in homogenous magnetic field oriented parallel to wires providing a rough electron transverse momentum filter .",
    "the position information along the wires will be used for the identification of the sequence of the cells passed by the electrons and for distinguishing between the electrons impinging onto and scattered from the energy detector .",
    "this is why the modest position resolution of a few mm is sufficient for that direction .",
    "crucial in the design is the analog part of the system . in principle ,",
    "commercial digitizers ( tdc , adc ) could be applied at the end of the acquisition chain .",
    "however , it has been decided to equip the data channels with custom digital boards with adjusted specifications such that the whole system is handy , cost effective and scalable .",
    "the applied on board processing ( fpga ) allows for acquiring up to 15 000 triggered events per second which gives a comfortable factor of 10 reserve as compared to the application in view .",
    "the described modular electronic system consists of three main parts : ( i ) preamplifiers , ( ii ) analog cards containing the peak detector and constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) , and ( iii ) the digital boards containing analog to digital converters , adc and tdc . the data logging software on the pc constitutes the data receiver .",
    "the signal from each signal plane is processed by means of one electronics module , which consists of two analog cards and one digital board providing 16 adc and 8 tdc channels . a corresponding block diagram is shown in fig .  [ daq ] .",
    "the signals from both ends of a signal wire are fed to inputs of preamplifiers located directly on the detector frames ( see fig .  [ pcbpre ] ) in order to minimize the input noise and protect the signal from em interferences .",
    "the signals from the preamplifiers are received by the analog cards which drive the adc inputs and produce the tdc stop signals .",
    "the digital data is transmitted via a lan port to the back - end computer where the process of receiving , sorting and formatting to a complete physical event is accomplished by the data logging software .",
    "the card configuration settings and control is done via a rs485 port .",
    "detailed description of each part of the system is presented in the following sections .",
    "signal readout from both ends of the relatively low resistance wire requires application of dedicated preamplifiers .",
    "low resistance wires force the use of fast preamplifiers with low input impedance since the change of signal amplitudes and thus position resolution depends on the input impedance .",
    "the lower the input impedance , the higher the voltage difference that is registered at the wire ends .",
    "the preamplifiers work in current - mode with the input impedance below 5 ohms and the input stage bandwidth exceeding 300 mhz .",
    "the preamplifier circuit is shown in fig .",
    "[ preamp ] .",
    "the first stage of the preamplifier is a current - voltage converter with two fast bipolar transistors .",
    "the voltage pulse is fed to the high - pass filter which cuts off the dc bias and the slow varying components of the signal .",
    "the first filter is followed by a low - pass filter integrating the pulse with 100 ns time constant .",
    "the signal is then amplified and transmitted to the differential amplifier used to drive the transmission line .",
    "differential signal transmission increases the external noise immunity when unshielded twisted pair ribbon cables are used to connect the preamplifier outputs to the inputs of the analog module .",
    "an example of input and output signals from a preamplifier is shown in fig .",
    "[ inppreamp ] .",
    "the input current signal was reproduced with the help of qucs package  @xcite .",
    "using bipolar transistors increases the preamplifier immunity to possible discharges in the gas chamber . adding more robust input protection ( e.g. a series resistor and protection diodes ) was abandoned as it would increase the input noise and impedance thus worsening the charge division resolution",
    "however , accidental discharges can not be avoided completely and the need for replacement of damaged preamplifiers was taken into account in the design .",
    "the individual preamplifiers are arranged as small piggyback pcb cards mounted directly on the wire frames ( fig .",
    "[ pcbpre ] ) .",
    "they can be replaced easily without unplugging cables or any other major intervention in the setup .",
    "additionally , such a solution minimizes the length of the unshielded connection between the wire end and the preamplifier input .",
    "the block diagram of the analog circuit is presented in fig .",
    "[ analog ] .",
    "differential signals from the preamplifiers are processed by the analog circuit .",
    "the signals from both wire ends are split into two branches . in the first branch ,",
    "signals from both ends are added and fed to the cfd which produces a ttl pulse for the time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) . a delay correction",
    "prior to the summing is not needed unless it is of the order of 1 ns ( corresponding to about 20 cm cable length )  significantly less than the rise time of real signals from the mwdc .",
    "care is taken to assure the equal length of the connecting cables .",
    "if the sum of the analog signals is higher than the set value of the cfd threshold , the stop signal for the tdc is generated .",
    "the schematic of the cfd is presented in fig .",
    "[ cfd ] .        in the second branch ,",
    "both signals are transmitted to the fast peak - hold detectors , which are responsible for detection of the pulse amplitudes in a given gate time .",

    "the schematic of the peak - hold detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ phd ] .",
    "the gate and hold signals are produced by a programmable timing circuit located on the analog board which uses the tdc start signal ( external trigger ) as a time reference .",

    "the digital board consists of 16 channels of 14-bit adcs ( ad8099 chips made by analog devices ) and a 8 channel tdc ( tdc - gpx chip made by acam messelectronic gmbh ) . using 14-bit adcs was dictated by the large dynamic range of the amplitudes of the signals from a gas detector operated in the proportional mode .",
    "the high bit adc resolution increases the overall performance of the charge division method .",
    "the time resolution of the used tdc chip is significantly better than actually needed ( 83 ps binning resolution with the typical standard deviation of 77 ps , from the device datasheet ) .",
    "the board measures the delay between the common start ( trigger ) pulse and the individual stop signals received from the constant fraction discriminators , as well as the amplitudes of the pulses delivered by the peak - hold detectors .",
    "the stop signals are delayed by a 50 ns delay line in order to compensate for the delays introduced in the analog circuit generating the start signal .",
    "the adcs sample the signals with 20 msps sampling rate .",
    "the fpga chip ( xilinx spartan xc3s400 ) receives the data from the adcs and the tdc , buffers them , provides zero - suppression and time - stamping , and formats the data frame as described in the next paragraph .",
    "the flow diagram of the acquisition algorithm and the data transmission algorithm are shown in fig .  [ daq_alg ] .",
    "the data frame is transmitted to the integrated ethernet / udp stack ( wiznet w5100 ) which is responsible for communication with the back - end pc hosting the acquisition and control software .",

    "the fourth part contains the tdc values - up to eight 24-bit unsigned integer values .",
    "only the non - zero values of the tdc data are transmitted .",
    "the time tagging is used because the ethernet protocol does not ensure the sequence of the data packet delivery .",

    "for the application in view , a 1 ns drift time corresponds to about 250 @xmath9 m distance ( from garfield simulations ) .",
    "the maximum throughput of the system reaches 15 khz per channel ( 120 khz per module ) and is limited by the transmission time of 60 @xmath9s needed for a single event .",
    "the front - end electronics and daq system described here was designed to be used with a special multi - wire drift chamber for tracking low energy electrons from nuclear @xmath2 decays .",
    "it incorporates both the drift time and charge division measurements allowing for efficient 3d determination of the electron tracks with very few and only parallel sense wires .",
    "the performed tests show that the electronic contribution to the drift time measurement uncertainty is less than 1 ns corresponding to about 250 @xmath9 m position uncertainty at the expected electron drift velocities .",
    "such result is satisfactory since in the planned experiment the track position resolution will be dominated by the electron angular straggling effects in the gas as shown in monte carlo simulations and confirmed in the small prototype test described in ref .",
    ". the necessary spatial resolution of the electron track position determined from the drift time need not to be better than 500 @xmath9 m .",
