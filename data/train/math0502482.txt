    "in this paper we develop further the study of immersions of two - dimensional surfaces in multidimensional euclidean or minkowski spaces by means of @xmath0 models , which was carried out in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the key point is the formulation of the equations defining the immersion directly in the matrix form ( cf .",
    "equation [ 3_2 ] ) where the immersion takes values in the lie algebra @xmath2 , identified by means of the negative of the killing form with the euclidean space @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to formulate explicitly the structural equations for the immersion ( the gauss ",
    "weingarten and the gauss  codazzi ",
    "ricci equations ) directly in matrix terms .",
    "in particular in proposition [ prop3 ] we establish an explicit form of the gauss - weingarten equations satisfied by the moving frame on a surface corresponding to the @xmath0 model .",
    "this is done in a fashion independent of any specific parametrization .",
    "then we use this result to establish various geometric characteristics of the studied immersions like curvatures and curvature vectors .",
    "all these quantities are directly derived from the map describing the relevant @xmath0 model . for the simplest case @xmath5 the equation ( [ 3_2 ] )",
    "defining the immersion takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the usual pauli matrices , and the differentials of coordinate functions of the immersion @xmath8 are given in terms of the affine coordinate @xmath9 of @xmath10 model by equation ( [ 4_3 ] ) . as follows from the equation ( [ 1_22 ] ) describing the @xmath10 model , a particular class of solutions of this model",
    "is given by an arbitrary holomorphic function @xmath9  in this case the immersion is minimal ( i.e. represents a surface with zero mean curvature ) and @xmath9 expresses the gauss map of the surface by means of the stereographic projection .",
    "this is directly related to the classical weierstrass  enneper formulae for an immersion of a minimal surface in @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , almost one and half century ago weierstrass and enneper showed @xcite that every minimal surface in @xmath11 can be represented locally in terms of two holomorphic functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 defined on a domain @xmath14 by the following expressions @xmath15 this implies that the complex tangent vector of the immersion is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the ( complex ) derivative with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the metric of the minimal surface is conformal and is expressed in terms of local parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 by the formula @xmath20 this implies , in particular , that the coordinate lines @xmath21 and @xmath22 describe geodesics on this surface .",
    "the ideas of enneper and weierstrass have since been developed by many authors with a purpose of extending them to construct immersions of more general types of surfaces . for a classical presentation",
    "we refer to a treatise by eisenhardt@xcite and for a modern approach to the subject see e.g. @xcite and references therein , in particular the recent books by f. helein @xcite and k. kenmotsu @xcite .",
    "this topic has been further explored by , among others , b. konopelchenko @xcite .",
    "he established a direct connection between generic surfaces and trajectories of an infinite - dimensional hamiltonian system .",
    "namely , he considered a nonlinear dirac type system of equations for two complex - valued functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 of @xmath25 @xmath26 he showed @xcite that for any solutions @xmath27 of the system ( [ 0_4 ] ) and an arbitrary curve @xmath28 in the complex plane , the following integrals over the bilinear combinations of @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 determine the coordinates of the radius vector @xmath32 describing a constant mean curvature ( cmc ) surface immersed in @xmath33 ( the integrals are independent of the integration path , since the integrands are exact differentials ) .",
    "to see how to reduce more general cases down to this case see e.g. ref @xcite . in accordance with @xcite",
    "we will refer to equations ( [ 0_4 ] ) and ( [ 0_5 ] ) as the generalized weierstrass formulae .",
    "it was shown in our previous work @xcite that the generalized weierstrass formulae for two - dimensional surfaces with non - vanishing mean curvature in multi - dimensional spaces are equivalent to @xmath0 sigma models .",
    "this determination has opened a new way for constructing and studying two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "the further advantage of use of the @xmath0 models in this context lies in the fact that they allow us to replace the methods based on dirac - type equations by the formalism connected with completely integrable systems , for example lax pairs , hamiltonian structures , or systems defining infinite number of conserved quantities .",
    "an original procedure for constructing the general classical solutions admitting finite action of the euclidean two - dimensional @xmath0 model was devised by a.m. din et al @xcite .",
    "these solutions are obtained by repeated applications of a certain transformation to the basic solution expressed in terms of holomorphic functions . as a result ,",
    "one gets three classes of solutions : holomorphic , anti - holomorphic and the `` mixed '' ones . in this paper",
    "we show that to each of these solutions we can associate a surface in @xmath34 . in the holomorphic ( or antiholomorphic ) case we are able to integrate completely the equations of the immersion .",
    "it turns out that in the @xmath35 case the surface is a part of an euclidean sphere , cf .",
    "section [ sec : cp1 ] .",
    "however for arbitrary @xmath36 other situations are possible . in example",
    "@xmath37 in section [ sec : cp2 ] we present a one - parameter family of surfaces for which the curvature is not constant but for some specific values of this parameter it reduces to a constant .",
    "the second and third examples in section [ sec : cp2 ] are concerned with mixed solutions of the @xmath38 model . in one case",
    "we obtain a surface in @xmath39 , which happens to be immersible in @xmath11 , but the immersion does not come from a @xmath35 model , since the curvature is not constant .",
    "the other mixed solution leads to a generic surface in @xmath39 with nonconstant curvatures .",
    "all these results raise interesting questions which require further investigations concerning general properties of immersions given by the @xmath0 models - either holomorphic or mixed .    finally , let us note that the outlined approach to the study of surfaces in @xmath40 lends itself to numerous potential applications .",
    "it is useful for description of monodromy of solutions of higher order painlev equations and their connection with theory of surfaces .",
    "it can also lead to the development of numerical computing tools in the study of surfaces through the techniques of completely integrable systems .",
    "surfaces immersed in lie groups , lie algebras and homogeneous spaces appear in many areas of physics , chemistry and biology@xcite .",
    "the algebraic approach to structural equations of these surfaces has often proved to be very difficult from the computational point of view .",
    "a natural geometric approach to derivation and classification of such equations which we propose here seems therefore to be of importance for applications in physics and other sciences .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cpn ] we introduce basic material on @xmath0 models  in presenting it we focus on the use of a compatibility condition , rather then on the usual approach via the euler ",
    "lagrange equations .",
    "the next section is devoted to the presentation of required notions and facts on the structure of complex projective spaces . here",
    "we prove in detail a certain decomposition of the group @xmath41 , which was previously noted in the paper @xcite of rowe et al . in section [ sec : sun ] we show how to use the equations of the @xmath0 model to construct an immersion of a surface in the lie algebra @xmath2 .",
    "the obtained formula extends the classical weierstrass formula for the conformal immersion of a @xmath42-dimensional surface into the @xmath43-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we derive the equations of the moving frame for the above immersion in @xmath2 and derive some geometrical characteristics of these surfaces .",
    "this analysis is developed further in sections [ sec : cp1 ] and [ sec : su3 ] , where , using the conformality of the surfaces obtained from the @xmath0 models for @xmath44 , we establish an explict formula for the moving frame in terms of the data of the model .",
    "let us note that the case @xmath45 produces surfaces immersed in @xmath46 . in section [ sec",
    ": cp2 ] we illustrate our theoretical considerations with some examples based on explicit solutions of the @xmath38 sigma model .",
    "the last section contains remarks and sugestions regarding possible further developments .",
    "from a large supply of geometrical models of immersions @xcite we concentrate in this paper on a particular class of models , the so called @xmath0 sigma models .",
    "the @xmath0 sigma model can be defined in terms of functions @xmath47 defined on an simply connected domain ( i.e. an open connected subset ) @xmath48 of the complex plane and satisfying the constraint @xmath49 .",
    "here and below we employ the standard notation where points of the complex coordinate space @xmath50 are denoted by @xmath51 and the standard hermitian inner product in @xmath50 , respectively the norm , by @xmath52 the unit sphere in @xmath50 corresponding to this norm is given by @xmath53 we shall use @xmath54 to denote ordinary derivatives and @xmath55 for the covariant derivatives defined according to the formula @xmath56 with this notation the lagrangian density for such a model is given by ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) @xmath57 and the solutions of the @xmath0 model are stationary points of the action functional @xmath58 the physically relevant case concerns fields which can be extended to the whole riemann sphere @xmath59 , but the case of an arbitrary @xmath48 is also of some interest , especially for questions of ( local ) differential geometry .",
    "next we note that since @xmath60 is not changed by the transformations @xmath61 with @xmath62 , it is actually defined by the map @xmath63 : \\omega \\rightarrow { { { { { \\mathbb c}}}}p^{n}}$ ] , where @xmath63= \\{e^{i\\varphi}z\\mid \\varphi \\in { { { \\mathbb r}}}\\}$ ] is the element of the projective space @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 .",

    "the most important advantage of the presented method is that it is quite general . in constructing surfaces we proceeded directly from the given @xmath0 model , without refering to any additional considerations .",
    "another important advantage of our method is that , due to the conservation laws of the @xmath0 model , the obtained expressions for surfaces are given at least in the form of quadratures .",
    "we have discussed in detail the geometrical aspects of the constructed surfaces .",
    "namely , we have demonstrated through the use of moving frame that one can derive , via the @xmath0 models , the first and the second fundamental forms of a given surface as well as relations between them as expressed in the gauss ",
    "weingarten and the gauss  codazzi ",
    "ricci equations .",
    "we have illustrated the proposed method of constructing surfaces in the case of low dimensional @xmath2 lie algebras .",
    "a systematic application of the group theory makes its possible to obtain large number of particular solutions of the @xmath0 equations and associated surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "a question arises whether these solutions , corresponding to specific boundary conditions , are actually observable in nature .",
    "the answer depends to a large degree on their stability .",
    "stable solutions should be observable and should also provide the starting point for perturbative calculations",
    ". these should in turn provide good approximative solutions relevant for situations in which the group - theoretical solutions no longer apply . in this context",
    "another question arises , namely what physical insight one gains from exact analytic expressions for surfaces .",
    "a particular answer is that they show up qualitative features that might be difficult to detect numerically .",
    "we hope that our approach and our results may be useful in applications to the study of surfaces which arise in physics , chemistry and biology , by providing explicit models in situations which have been well investigated experimentally but for which the theory is not yet well developed .",
