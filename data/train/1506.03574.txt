    "the maximum of the moduli of the conjugates of @xmath7 is @xmath9 for any @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   there exists a sequence of rational integers @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 is an algebraic integer for all  @xmath14 .",
    "3 .   @xmath15 satisfies a homogeneous linear differential equation with coefficients in @xmath16 .",
    "an @xmath0-function is defined similarly , as @xmath17 with the same assumptions @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 instead of @xmath15 there ) .    a minimal differential equation satisfied by a given @xmath1-function",
    "is called a @xmath1-operator .",
    "any @xmath0-function is solution of an @xmath0-operator ( not necessarily minimal ) obtained as the fourier - laplace transform of a @xmath1-operator . in  @xcite , andr set the foundations of the theory of @xmath0-operators ; he proved in particular that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the only possible singularities , with rational exponents , and that 0 is a regular one .",
    "he also constructed two special bases of solutions of any @xmath0-operator at @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , and obtained a fundamental duality between these bases .",
    "a basic approach for constructing such bases is to lift the basis of solutions of the underlying @xmath1-operator through the fourier - laplace transform .",
    "however , it is well - known that there may not be enough such solutions to built a basis of the @xmath0-operator . a crucial ingredient in andr s",
    "construction is the notion of microsolutions ( of the @xmath1-operator here ) in the sense of kashiwara @xcite , which enables one to lift enough `` solutions '' of the @xmath1-operator .",
    "our first theorem below is aimed at a better understanding of microsolutions of fuchsian operators , of which @xmath1-operators are a special case .",
    "we shall explain in detail after the statement of the theorem the implications to andr s @xmath0-operators theory . for any @xmath22 , let @xmath23 denote the ring of germs of functions holomorphic at @xmath24 .",

    "let @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath25 be such that @xmath36 whenever @xmath37 are distinct .",

    "then there exists a function @xmath40 , holomorphic on the cut plane @xmath32 , such that :    * @xmath41 is a polynomial . * for any @xmath38 , we have @xmath42 .",
    "moreover if @xmath40 and @xmath43 have these properties then @xmath44 is a polynomial .",
    "we refer to  1.4 of @xcite for an analogous result",
    ". we shall prove theorem [ thintroun ] in  [ sec3 ] , with an explicit upper bound on the degree of @xmath41 .",
    "the interest of this result is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "given @xmath45 any microsolution at @xmath24 ( see below ) can be represented by a fonction holomorphic on @xmath32 and such that @xmath41 is a polynomial ; this is of special interest to us when @xmath31 is a @xmath1-operator , because @xmath40 can therefore be expressed in terms of @xmath1-functions using the andr - chudnovski - katz theorem . on the other hand , microsolutions",
    "at all finite singularities of @xmath31 can be glued together to produce a global function @xmath40 ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ thintroun ] will be used in this paper only when @xmath31 is fuchsian , so that we did not try to remove the assumption that @xmath3 is a regular singularity of @xmath31 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thintroun ] is based on a linear bijective map @xmath46 ( provided by analytic continuation ) from @xmath47}\\}/{{\\mathbb{c}}[z]}\\ ] ] to @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the space of microsolutions of @xmath31 at @xmath24 as considered by kashiwara @xcite .",
    "when @xmath31 is a @xmath1-operator , we prove also that @xmath46 and @xmath50 are represented ( in algebraic bases ) by matrices of which all coefficients are values of @xmath1-functions at algebraic points .",
    "we apply theorem [ thintroun ] more specifically to the following setting .",
    "let @xmath51 \\rightarrow   { \\mathbb{c}}[x,\\frac{\\dd}{\\dd x}]$ ] denote the fourier - laplace transform of differential operators , i.e. the morphism of @xmath33-algebras defined by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be an @xmath0-operator , that is @xmath55 for some @xmath1-operator @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath56 , resp . @xmath57 , the space of local solutions of @xmath54 at the origin , resp . of formal solutions at infinity .",
    "we recall @xcite that a _",
    "gevrey series of order @xmath58 of arithmetical type _ is a power series @xmath59 with @xmath60 such that @xmath61 is a @xmath1-function , except maybe that it does nt satisfy the holonomy assumption .",
    "provided it is holonomic , with @xmath62 , resp .",
    "@xmath63 , resp .",
    "@xmath64 , this is a @xmath1-function , resp . an @xmath0-function , resp . an -function @xcite .",
    "these series form a differential algebra denoted by @xmath65 . a finite sum @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "is called in @xcite a _ nilsson - gevrey series _ of order @xmath71 of arithmetical type .",
    "this differential algebra is denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "we denote by @xmath73 the subset obtained by restricting to algebraic coefficients @xmath74 .",
    "andr proved @xcite that @xmath56 has a basis @xmath75 in @xmath76 , i.e. consisting of nilsson - gevrey series of order @xmath77 of arithmetical type with algebraic coefficients @xmath74 . denoting again by @xmath35 the set of finite singularities of @xmath31 , he has proved also that @xmath57 has a basis @xmath78 in @xmath79 .",
    "we refer to theorem [ thya ] in  [ subsecnvpreuve ] below for the precise statement of andr s result , including duality relations between @xmath75 and @xmath78 .",
    "in this paper we give a new proof of andr s result , in a more constructive way .",
    "andr s proof is based on laplace transform , which connects solutions of @xmath54 to microsolutions of @xmath31 and enables him to apply fundamental results on @xmath1-functions .",
    "we revisit his approach in several directions .",
    "first we factor the inverse laplace transform as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a transcendental part ( involving values of the gamma function and its derivatives at rational points ) , and @xmath82 is a rational part ( with only rational coefficients in suitable bases ) ; @xmath82 is strongly related to manjra - remmal s operator @xcite but is not exactly the same .",
    "moreover @xmath81 commutes with differential operators , whereas @xmath82 behaves like the inverse laplace transform with respect to differential operators .",
    "we prove that @xmath82 induces ( for @xmath45 ) an explicit linear isomorphism defined over @xmath4 between the space @xmath83 of microsolutions of @xmath31 at @xmath24 and the space of solutions of @xmath54 in @xmath84 .",
    "since microsolutions of @xmath31 can be represented in terms of @xmath1-functions ( see the remark following theorem [ thintroun ] above ) , this provides an effective construction of a basis @xmath78 of @xmath57 as in @xcite .",
    "we obtain also , in the same effective way , a basis @xmath75 of @xmath56 . a major difference with andr s paper",
    "is the use of @xmath82 , which is a formal operator , instead of the laplace transform itself and operational calculus to give it a meaning when it is divergent .",
    "this enables us to get rid completely of @xmath85 values , and to work only with algebraic coefficients @xmath86 ; we also obtain a new proof of the formal version of theorem 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "another important difference is that our study includes the case of integer exponents of @xmath31 , whereas andr uses a trick to avoid it ( see p.  734 of @xcite ) .",
    "our point of view enables us to study from an arithmetic point of view the bijective linear map @xmath87 given by asymptotic expansion in a large sector bisected by @xmath88 ; here @xmath25 is a fixed non - anti - stokes direction , and throughout the paper a large sector bisected by @xmath88 is a sector of the form @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for the definition of asymptotic expansion ; in other words , @xmath91 is ramis 1-summation in the direction @xmath88 ( which coincides in this case with borel - laplace summation ) .",
    "let @xmath92 denote the matrix of @xmath93 in bases @xmath75 and @xmath78 as above .",
    "the main result of @xcite asserts that @xmath92 has coefficients in the @xmath94-module @xmath95 generated by all values at rational points of @xmath85 and its derivatives , where @xmath94 is the ring of values at algebraic points of analytic continuations of @xmath1-functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath96 is also a ring .",
    "we shall prove in  [ subsecarith ] that @xmath92 has a non - zero algebraic determinant , so that @xmath97 has also coefficients in @xmath96 .",
    "this enables us to obtain the following result :    [ thnvcor ] let @xmath98 be an -function , and @xmath25 be a non - anti - stokes direction",
    ". then there exist @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 ) such that @xmath103    with respect to @xcite , the new feature in this corollary is that @xmath101 .",
    "to state our next result , we recall that a stokes matrix ( relative to an @xmath0-operator @xmath54 ) is the matrix of change of coordinates between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath88 and @xmath106 are non - anti - stokes directions and @xmath78 is a basis of @xmath57 as above . in general @xmath88 and @xmath106",
    "are assumed to be one anti - stokes direction apart from each other , but we shall not need this assumption here .",
    "[ corintrode ] any stokes matrix ( relative to an @xmath0-operator @xmath54 ) has coefficients in @xmath96 and a non - zero algebraic determinant .",
    "finally , we define a very large class of values of special functions .",
    "we denote by @xmath107 the @xmath96-module generated by @xmath108 .",
    "we recall @xcite that @xmath108 is the set of values at algebraic points of @xmath0-functions ; it is a ring .",
    "therefore @xmath107 is also a ring ; it consists in all finite sums of products @xmath109 where @xmath1 is the analytic continuation of a @xmath1-function , @xmath0 is an @xmath0-function , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is euler s constant ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for instance @xmath107 contains all values at algebraic points of airy s oscillating integral , and that of bessel s functions @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "actually it contains all values at algebraic points of nilsson - gevrey series of any order of arithmetical type with algebraic coefficients @xmath74 ( up to 1-summation in any direction in the case of divergent series ) , and especially values of all generalized hypergeometric series .",
    "we shall deduce from the duality between @xmath0- and -functions a dual expression of @xmath107 .",
    "let us denote by * *  the set of all complex numbers @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is an -function ; here @xmath118 and @xmath119 is ramis 1-summation of @xmath117 in the direction @xmath88 if @xmath88 is not anti - stokes , and @xmath120 for any small @xmath121 if @xmath88 is anti - stokes ( this is independent from the choice of such an @xmath122 ) .",
    "andr has conjectured @xcite that siegel - shidlovskii theorem on values of @xmath0-functions has an analogue for -functions .",
    "we shall prove in  [ subsec43 ] that * *  is a ring which contains algebraic numbers , gompertz s constant @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for any @xmath125 where @xmath126 is airy s oscillating integral . using theorem [ thnvcor ] and the results of @xcite we obtain the following dual characterization of @xmath107 .",
    "[ thintrotr ] the @xmath96-module generated by the numbers @xmath127 , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 * * , is equal to @xmath107 .",

    ", @xmath134 is a semi - algebraic domain ( i.e. , it is defined by polynomial inequalities and/or equalities with algebraic coefficients ) , and @xmath40 , @xmath135 are algebraic functions . restricting to @xmath136 yields the ring @xmath137 of periods , in the sense of kontsevich - zagier @xcite . in view of the bombieri - dwork conjecture ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether @xmath138 $ ] ( see  2.2 of @xcite ) . in the present setting",
    ", the corresponding question would be whether @xmath139 $ ] ( see  [ subsec43 ] ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec2 ] we factor the ( inverse ) laplace transform as announced above : we construct the operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and study their properties .",
    "this part of the paper does not involve any specific class of differential operators ; it would be interesting to find other situations where it could be used . in ",
    "[ sec3 ] we study the microsolutions at all finite singularities of a differential operator @xmath140 $ ] of which @xmath3 is a regular singularity , and prove theorem [ thintroun ] .",
    "when @xmath31 is fuchsian , we also explain how the analytic continuation map @xmath141 corresponds , through laplace transform , to a duality between the solutions of @xmath55 at 0 and at @xmath3 , given by asymptotic expansion .",
    "using either @xmath46 , of @xmath82 and @xmath81 , we get two new constructions of andr s extension of laplace transform ( based on operational calculus ) .",
    "we relate them and sum up our results in a commutative diagram ( see  [ secdiaglg ] ) .",
    "at last we apply our results in  [ secspecialvalues ] to the case where @xmath31 is a @xmath1-operator .",
    "this enables us to obtain a new constructive proof of andr s duality theorem , and to prove the arithmetic results announced in this introduction . at last ,",
    "we work out in  [ subsec44 ] a simple example related to gompertz constant , to illustrate the whole situation .",
