    "mapping the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is one of the major goals of observational cosmology .",
    "traditionally this is performed using large surveys of galaxies , either the projected 2-dimensional distributions or the 3-dimensional surveys in redshift space .",
    "the main shortcoming of the galaxy surveys is that they trace light , while most of the matter appears to be dark .",
    "one therefore needs to translate the galaxy power spectrum into the matter power spectrum and in order to do so one has to make some assumptions on the nature of galaxy biasing . even in the simplest model",
    "this can be achieved only up to an unknown biasing parameter @xmath9 , which at present can not be theoretically estimated .",
    "while sophisticated n - body and hydro - dynamical simulations will eventually provide some answers to this question , at present the biasing relation between the light and matter remains rather poorly understood and prevents one from drawing definitive conclusions on the amplitude and distribution of mass fluctuations in the universe from galaxy survey data .",
    "it is clearly important to seek ways to estimate the large - scale structure that are insensitive to biasing .",
    "several observable tracers have been proposed that probe directly the underlying mass distribution : cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , gravitational lensing , peculiar velocity flows and abundances of massive nonlinear objects .",
    "this paper focuses on tracing the dark matter with gravitational lensing , in particular the effects of weak lensing by large scale structure on background galaxies .",
    "weak lensing magnifies and shears the images of distant galaxies .",
    "the shear induces an ellipticity in the image of an intrinsically circular galaxy .",
    "background galaxies are of course not circular , but by averaging over the observed ellipticities of a large number of galaxies , the induced ellipticity can be measured , and related to the mass fluctuations along the line of sight and to the spatial geometry of the universe .",
    "ellipticities of distant background galaxies averaged over several arcminute windows are sensitive to the mass power spectrum on scales of @xmath10 mpc . for a given spectrum of mass fluctuations , it is sensitive to the cosmological parameters @xmath8 and @xmath11 . thus while strong lensing which leads to multiple images probes non - typical regions of the universe which contain massive halos , weak lensing provides a different and a more direct measure of the mass fluctuations on large scales .",
    "the first calculations of the shear signal due to weak lensing that used modern models for the large scale structure power spectrum were those of @xcite and @xcite , based on the pioneering work by gunn ( 1967 ) .",
    "our work generalizes the results of these authors to include the effects of nonlinear evolution of the matter fluctuations for flat as well as open and @xmath12dominated cosmologies .",
    "villumsen ( 1996 ) has considered some aspects of the linear calculation for open models .",
    "very recently , bernardeau et al . ( 1996 ) , kaiser ( 1996 ) and stebbins ( 1996 ) have also made the linear calculation for different cosmologies .",
    "our work extends the results of the above authors by using the nonlinear power spectrum , which makes a significant difference on small angular scales of @xmath13 . for the nonlinear calculation we have used the prescription of @xcite as implemented by @xcite and @xcite which provide accurate power spectra for different models , valid from the linear to the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "one can take two different approaches in interpreting a possible measurement of the shear signal .",
    "the first is to work within the framework of a physical model for the dark matter and background cosmology .",
    "such a model is best normalized to cobe and then its small scale predictions can be compared to the observational constraints of e.g. cluster or damped ly-@xmath14 system abundances , strong lensing statistics or peculiar velocity flows , or in our case the shear amplitude on a given angular scale .",
    "another possibility , which is less model dependent , is to compare the constraints from different tracers on the same physical scale .",
    "this way one can test the gravitational instability assumption that both tracers probe the same underlying power spectrum and place constraints on the cosmological parameters which scale differently with the tracers . at the present",
    "the cmb data constrain the power spectrum only on very large scales , where there are no available data from other tracers . while several current cmb experiments are approaching the scales probed by other tracers , cosmological parameters such as baryon density , reionization epoch and hubble constant become important and complicate the power spectrum reconstruction .",
    "the test mentioned above is possible between the cluster abundances ( or strong lensing statistics of multiple images at large separation , both of which trace essentially the same property ) and the peculiar velocities .",
    "unfortunately this method can not give model independent constraints on cosmological parameters , because the two tracers scale roughly equally with the matter density @xmath8 ( peebles 1980 , white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) .",
    "a similar comparison can also be made between weak lensing observations and the tracers discussed above .",
    "for example , the shear amplitude on @xmath1 angular scale and rich cluster abundance both probe power spectrum scales around @xmath15 mpc , so the ratio of the two is roughly independent of the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "one could hope that using such comparisons would lead to an estimate of the mean density of the universe , because the two tracers scale differently with it .",
    "unfortunately as shown in this paper this is not the case so that this is not a promising method of obtaining the mean density .",
    "nevertheless , weak lensing can also give important constraints on the power spectrum both on smaller and larger scales , where other tracers give less stringent constraints . on the smaller angular scales , our calculations provide the enhancement in the amplitude and the change in the scalings with @xmath16 and @xmath8 that arise due to nonlinear evolution .",
    "once reliable detections of the shear at different angular scales are available , these results can be used to constrain cosmological parameters and the matter power spectrum .",
    "the principal advantage of working with weak lensing is that no assumptions about the formation of observable structures need to be made to connect the mass power spectrum to the observed shear .",
    "the only unknown parameter is the redshift distribution of source galaxies , and in principle this can also be determined observationally .    in  2 and the appendix ,",
    "the formalism for the weak lensing calculation is presented following seljak ( 1995 , 1996 ) , who generalized the work by @xcite and @xcite to a non - flat universe and non - linear regime .",
    "the derivation presented here is complementary to recent derivations by bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kaiser ( 1996 ) . the linear and nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum",
    "is introduced in  2.1 , and the resulting dependence on cosmological parameters for power law spectra is obtained in  2.2 . in  3 realistic cdm - like spectra are used to predict the rms shear .",
    "we provide accurate power law fits for the dependence of the shear on the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath16 and @xmath8 for different cosmological models . ",
    "3.1 provides predictions of the shear for cobe and cluster - abundance normalized spectra for the range of angular scales which are being probed by current and forthcoming observations .",
    "the effects of non - gaussianity in the distribution of shear are considered in  4 where we compute the skewness of the distribution .",
    "this is followed by a discussion and conclusions in  5 .",
    "gravitational lensing shears and magnifies the images of distant galaxies .",
    "the relation of the shear to perturbations in the gravitational potential along the line of sight is developed in the appendix .",
    "here we shall use the formalism presented in the appendix to derive expressions for 3 different measures of the second moment of the shear .",
    "the observable mean ellipticity of galaxy images can be simply defined in the approximation that the images are ellipses with complex eccentricity @xmath18 given by the axes lengths @xmath9 and @xmath19 as : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the position angle of the major axis . in the limit of weak distortions ,",
    "the eccentricity is the same as ellipticity @xmath22 .",
    "while individual galaxies have intrinsic ellipticities which can not be separated from gravitational stretching , we have assumed here that averaging over several galaxies leaves only the gravitational component which can in principle be measured .",
    "this mean ellipticity @xmath23 will be denoted as @xmath24 and is defined by equation ( [ shear3 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "we shall use @xmath25 to denote its amplitude in what follows .",
    "information on the ellipticity is contained in the trace - free part of the shear tensor , which is obtained by integrating over all the deflectors between us and the galaxy and over the distribution of background galaxies @xmath26 ( see appendix ) , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the gravitational potential and @xmath29 is the radial comoving distance with @xmath30 being the horizon distance .",
    "we also introduced the comoving angular distance @xmath31 defined in equation ( [ rchi ] ) .",
    "the radial distribution of background galaxies is described with the window @xmath32 .",
    "if all the galaxies are assumed to lie at the same redshift @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath33 , then @xmath34 , and @xmath35 takes the simple form , @xmath36    there are several two - point statistics that can quantify the induced ellipticites in galaxy images .",
    "the easiest to obtain from observations is the rms ellipticity @xmath37 , where the overbar indicates the average within a circular aperture of radius @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ shear ] ) can be used to express @xmath38 in terms of the power spectrum of density perturbations @xmath39 . following the derivation presented in the appendix",
    "we obtain for the ellipticity variance @xmath40d\\chi , \\label{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the bessel function of first order and @xmath19 is the expansion factor normalized to unity today .",
    "a related quantity is the two - point polarization correlation function @xmath43 , which is given by a similar expression to the one above , replacing the term @xmath44 with @xmath45 : @xmath46\\ , d\\chi . \\label{cpp}\\ ] ] the fourier transform of @xmath47 is the angular ellipticity power spectrum @xmath48 , which is often the optimal statistic to use ( kaiser 1992 ) .",
    "here we use the quantity @xmath49 , which gives the contribution to the variance per log - interval in @xmath50 and is given by @xmath51 this gives an estimate of correlations at an angle @xmath52 .",
    "no assumption on the matter power spectrum has been made in the above expressions and one can use them both in the linear and nonlinear regime .",
    "the nonlinear spectrum is in general a non - separable function of wavenumber and redshift , thus leading to a complicated coupling of the dependences on the distance factors and the growth of perturbations .",
    "it also leads to a nonlinear dependence of the predicted ellipticity correlations on the shape and amplitude of the initial power spectrum .",
    "thus the amplitude of the ellipticity correlations as well as their dependence on cosmological parameters can change in the nonlinear regime ( i.e. , on small angular scales ) . in the rest of the paper we shall explore in detail the outcome of these effects of nonlinear evolution .",
    "if the gravitational potential changes in time its power spectrum will depend on the radial distance @xmath29 . in linear theory this dependence is independent of @xmath53 and can be written in terms of the potential growth factor @xmath54 as @xmath55 , which gives for the density power spectrum @xmath56(\\chi)p_\\delta(k)$ ] , where @xmath57 is the linear growth factor for the density .",
    "this can be approximated as ( lahav et al .",
    "1991 ) @xmath58 we have ignored the weak @xmath11 dependence of the logarithmic growth factor . for @xmath59 , this expression simplifies to @xmath60 for a flat @xmath61 model the gravitational potential does not change in time in the linear regime and the region where @xmath35 peaks dominates the radial integral in equations ( [ p]-[ps ] ) .",
    "typically this is at half the mean comoving distance to the galaxies , so if background galaxies lie at @xmath62 typical deflectors lie at @xmath63 . in low @xmath8 models the gravitational potential increases with @xmath29 , differently for open and for cosmological constant models . in the small @xmath64 limit",
    "the growth factor only depends on @xmath8 ( villumsen 1996 ) .    on scales where @xmath65 approaches or exceeds",
    "unity nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum becomes important .",
    "this is particularly important if one is discussing low @xmath8 models , where both cluster abundances and peculiar velocity normalizations give higher density normalization on scales of interest . in the quasilinear regime",
    "the nonlinear spectrum can be computed using perturbation theory .",
    "an alternative semi - analytic approach which is accurate from the linear to the strongly nonlinear regime ( up to density contrasts @xmath66 ) was proposed by hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and further developed in subsequent work ( e.g. , nityananda & padmanabhan 1994 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ; jain , mo & white 1995 ; padmanabhan et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this prescription involves mapping the nonlinear spectrum at a wavenumber @xmath53 to the linear spectrum at a unique wavenumber @xmath67 which is given by a spherical collapse model .",
    "this leads to a mapping of the form @xmath68 $ ] , where the dimensionless power @xmath69 is defined above , and @xmath70 is a function which varies in a simple way for different initial spectra .",
    "the linear wavenumber @xmath71 is given by @xmath72^{-1/3}$ ] .",
    "the functional form of the mapping is thus specified by the function @xmath70 , which has been calibrated using high resolution n - body simulations and is accurate for a wide range of initial spectra .",
    "for the predictions of the rms ellipticity in  3 we shall use the fitting formulae of @xcite for @xmath61 and of @xcite for the open and @xmath12models to describe the nonlinear power spectrum as a function of wavenumber and redshift .",
    "we refer the reader to the above references for details of the formulae and their implementation .",
    "while the formulae can differ by a few tens of percent for certain spectra , we find that our results for the ellipticity are not affected by more than a few percent as the ellipticity integrates the power spectrum over a range of wavenumbers and redshifts .",
    "in particular the results for the cdm - like models shown in figures 4 - 9 would be completely unaffected by our choice of fitting formulae .      in the next section",
    "we shall use the nonlinear evolution of cdm - like spectra to predict the rms ellipticity signal . here",
    "we consider the simplified case of power law initial spectra @xmath73 to compute the scalings of @xmath47 and @xmath74 with source redshift @xmath3 , and the cosmological model parameters @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the rms fluctuation in the mass on scales of @xmath15mpc , and serves to normalize the power spectrum .",
    "we use the linear evolution of the power spectrum for which some of the scalings can be obtained analytically .",
    "we also consider the qualitative modification due to nonlinear evolution by using the stable clustering regime which gives the maximal effect of nonlinearities .",
    "the length scales that contribute to the ellipticity are of order @xmath15 mpc for @xmath75 . on these scales",
    "most realistic spectra have a spectral index @xmath76 . on smaller angular scales ,",
    "the contribution to the ellipticity comes from higher wavenumbers which sample a steeper part of the spectrum ( lower @xmath77 ) .",
    "we therefore choose power law spectra with @xmath78 and @xmath79 for comparison with realistic spectra on angular scales of interest .    for a power law spectrum",
    "the @xmath80integral for @xmath81 is analytic , and gives : @xmath82 valid for @xmath83 .",
    "the constant @xmath84 gives the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "aside from the numerical prefactors , the result for @xmath74 is the same and involves the same @xmath29 integral .    for simplicity we shall take all the source galaxies to be at the same redshift",
    " this is a good approximation as the result is insensitive to the source distribution for a given median source redshift .",
    "the window function @xmath35 then takes the form given in equation ( [ delta ] ) . for @xmath61 , @xmath85 , and the @xmath29",
    "integral is analytic as well giving the following power law dependence : @xmath86 using @xmath87 , the dependence of @xmath81 on the source redshift @xmath3 can be obtained from the above equation .    for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ,",
    "the result for @xmath81 is not analytic except in the limit of @xmath90 which is not of interest for realistic situations .",
    "it is simple to understand qualitatively the two physical effects that enter .",
    "@xmath91 for a given redshift , the distance @xmath29 increases as @xmath8 decreases and @xmath11 increases .",
    "therefore there is more path length in the line of sight integral as @xmath33 is larger for a given @xmath3 .",
    "the factor @xmath35 involves factors of the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; it also increases with decreasing @xmath8 and increasing @xmath11 .",
    "( ii ) the second factor is the linear growth factor @xmath54 .",
    "growth of structure slows down at low redshift in an open universe , and to a lesser extent in a @xmath12 dominated universe .",
    "therefore , at a given redshift the linear growth factor , normalized to unity today , increases as @xmath8 decreases , and for a given @xmath8 it decreases as @xmath11 increases .",
    "the effect of both the distance and growth factors is to increase the contribution from the @xmath29 integral in equation ( [ powerlaw ] ) relative to the einstein - de sitter case .",
    "the net contribution increases as @xmath8 decreases , and for a given @xmath8 , as @xmath11 increases . in the case of @xmath94 ,",
    "the distance factors dominate over the linear growth factor leading to a net increase over the case with the same @xmath8 .",
    "however the enhancement due to the integral over @xmath29 has to contend with the factor of @xmath95 outside the integral which is considerably larger .",
    "the net result is shown in figure [ fig1 ] for source galaxies at @xmath96 ( upper panel ) and @xmath97 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the y - axis shows @xmath95 times the @xmath29-integrand of equation ( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath81 or @xmath98 is proportional to the area under the curves shown , aside from numerical factors which depend on the shape of the spectrum .",
    "the figure shows that the peak contribution for a reasonable choice of @xmath3 comes from the range @xmath99 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath38 ( the same as that of the square root of @xmath81 ) with @xmath8 is dependent both on @xmath3 and the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "for @xmath100 the dependence is well fit by the power law , @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the above equation is quite accurate . for @xmath97",
    "the scaling depends on the spectrum , and can be approximated as , @xmath104 the result for @xmath79 is valid provided a low-@xmath53 cutoff is imposed to keep the integral finite . as expected , at higher source",
    "redshifts the enhancement due to the distance and growth factors is larger and leads to a weaker @xmath8 dependence .",
    "the same occurs as @xmath77 decreases , as then there is more power on large scales , and therefore more weight to the high-@xmath64 part of the integral",
    ". the results of equations ( [ scaling1 ] ) and ( [ scaling2 ] ) are valid for @xmath105 , and are intended to cover the range of source redshift and spectra spanned by realistic models .    a simple way to understand the dependence on @xmath8 follows from the fact that most of the lensing contribution comes from about half the distance to the source galaxies .",
    "thus the @xmath8 dependence of equations ( [ scaling1 ] ) and ( [ scaling2 ] ) can be compared to that of @xmath8 at the redshift @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 is well approximated by @xmath109 for @xmath96 and by @xmath110 for @xmath97 if @xmath79 . for a shallower slope",
    "there is more power on small scales , which are closer for a given angle .",
    "hence the results are closer to those of equations ( [ scaling1 ] ) and ( [ scaling2 ] ) for @xmath78 if one uses @xmath111 ( it makes very little difference if one uses @xmath31 instead of @xmath29 for this purpose ) .",
    "thus as a first approximation the @xmath8 dependence can be obtained by replacing the @xmath8 term in @xmath81 for the flat case , by the value of @xmath8 at @xmath112 to @xmath113 the distance to the source galaxies .",
    "the above scalings are derived using linear evolution of the power spectrum . on smaller angular scales",
    "nonlinear evolution could play an important role  in the next section we compute the change in the above scalings due to nonlinear effects .",
    "it is complicated to estimate the angular scale where nonlinear effects are important because each angle involves the projection of a range of length scales at different redshifts .",
    "the answer will therefore depend on the slope of the power spectrum . a rough estimate of the length scales that make the dominant contribution to @xmath38 is given by figure [ dist ] .",
    "this figure shows the transverse distance for a given @xmath17 at the redshifts estimated from figures [ fig1]a and [ fig1]b as providing the dominant contribution to @xmath114 for source galaxies at @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath13 this length scale is less than @xmath116mpc , which is the correlation length of galaxies and therefore a good demarcation of the nonlinear regime .",
    "we may thus expect that the linear results for @xmath114 will be modified for @xmath13 .",
    "an analytic estimate of the change in the above scalings due to strongly nonlinear effects can be made using the stable clustering solution .",
    "if one assumes that the lensing is dominated by clustering on small scales ( valid in the limit of small angles and low source redshift ) , which stabilized at high redshift , then the dimensionless power is a function of the physical wavenumber times @xmath117 .",
    "this property extends to the open models as well , because at high enough redshift , @xmath118 .",
    "it can then be shown that , if the linear spectrum is normalized to the same @xmath16 today , then the enhancement factor of the nonlinear spectrum relative to the linear one is proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "this follows from a reversed version of the argument of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) , which was made for spectra normalized to the same initial value .",
    "a particularly simple example is provided by the @xmath79 spectrum , for which the nonlinear slope and growth in the einstein - de sitter case are the same as in the linear regime .",
    "hence the nonlinear spectrum is given at all @xmath53 by a constant enhancement factor relative to the linear spectrum .",
    "for @xmath120 one can approximate @xmath121 for @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the @xmath8 dependence in @xmath74 due to strongly nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum is @xmath122 . in this regime then , @xmath123 times the contribution of the distance factors , which further lowers the power of @xmath8 .",
    "this estimate is meant to provide an upper bound on the enhancement for open models due to the nonlinear contribution . for realistic redshifts the contribution from such small scales does not dominate , and the exact , numerical estimates of the nonlinear spectrum must be integrated over @xmath53 and @xmath29 .",
    "still , it is clear that the @xmath8 dependence of weak lensing amplitude will be significantly weaker than the linear relation predicted from the scalings in previous subsection .",
    "the detailed predictions for the rms ellipticity depend on the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum , the distribution of source galaxies , and on the cosmological parameters @xmath8 and @xmath11 . in the following subsection we shall consider two alternative normalizations of realistic cdm - like power spectra . a useful , model independent description of the scalings can also be obtained by fitting the dependence on the different parameters to power laws .",
    "this provides a reasonably accurate approximation to the result , and shows the qualitative behavior more clearly .",
    "table 1 provides such power law fits to the scalings of @xmath114 with @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath16 , and @xmath8 for einstein - de sitter , open and @xmath12dominated cosmologies .",
    "the three specific models we have chosen are : einstein - de sitter ( @xmath61 , @xmath100 ) , open ( @xmath124 , @xmath100 ) , and @xmath12dominated ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the latter two models are representative of the class of open and flat @xmath12dominated cosmologies as the results do not change significantly for @xmath8 in the range @xmath126 .",
    "the matter power spectrum used in the calculations is the nonlinear @xmath127 cdm spectrum , where @xmath128 is the shape parameter defined in bardeen et al .",

    "the @xmath12model predicts a faster increase with @xmath3 due to a faster increase of the distance factors with redshift than the open case .",
    "once it becomes feasible to get estimates of the redshifts of source galaxies , this difference can become a useful test of @xmath94 as it is nearly independent of the shape and normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "in choosing the most realistic power spectrum to compute the polarization signal , the approach closest to other tracers of the mass density field would be to use the abundance of galaxy clusters or the peculiar velocity field of galaxies to estimate the amplitude @xmath16 , and to then use the galaxy power spectrum to constrain the shape ( peacock & dodds 1996 ; peacock 1996 ) .",
    "the merit of this approach is that it agrees with the observational constraints on the scales which are most relevant for weak lensing observations .",
    "an alternative is to work with physical models for the dark matter and cosmology which give the shape of the power spectrum , and use cobe - normalization to fix the spectrum on very large scales and thus its overall amplitude .",
    "the merit of this approach is that for a given model both the spectrum of perturbations and their evolution is fully determined .",
    "however , the final spectrum may or may not agree with the present day observations ( which interpretation is still somewhat uncertain ) .",
    "we shall present results using both approaches .",
    "the first of the two reliable tracers of mass fluctuations on large scales is the abundance of large galaxy clusters with a typical mass of @xmath149 , which corresponds to a linear scale of about @xmath15mpc .",
    "these objects are very rare and according to the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) their number density depends exponentially on the amplitude of mass fluctuation on the corresponding linear scale .",
    "this allows an accurate estimate of the amplitude , which typically gives @xmath150 ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 , viana & liddle 1995 , eke , cole & frenk 1996 , pen 1996 ) in an @xmath61 universe , almost independent of the shape of the power spectrum . at present",
    "this gives the best constraint on the linear density power spectrum , with an error of about 10 - 20% .",
    "the dependence on @xmath8 is approximately @xmath151 , and differs only slightly for open and spatially flat models .",
    "the scaling with @xmath8 and @xmath11 is still somewhat uncertain as it requires calibration with large n - body simulations .",
    "peculiar velocities are also tracers of underlying mass fluctuations . in the linear regime",
    "there is a simple relation between velocity and density fields ( peebles 1980):@xmath152 , where @xmath153 . the @xmath8 dependence on mass fluctuation amplitude from velocity data is @xmath154 , which is almost the same as for the cluster abundance in a flat universe and only slightly less so in an open universe .",
    "comparison of the two constraints therefore can not significantly constrain @xmath8 .",
    "given a set of velocity measurements one can reconstruct the particular combination @xmath155 and estimate its power spectrum .",
    "recent comparisons between mark iii tully - fisher catalogs and iras survey tend to favor @xmath156 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where @xmath157 is the linear bias parameter for iras galaxies .",
    "this combined with @xmath158 leads to @xmath159 , smaller than the value derived from the cluster abundance data .",
    "this would therefore reduce the weak lensing predictions presented in this paper .",
    "however , analysis of mark iii catalog with potent gives a higher value of @xmath160 ( kolatt & dekel 1996 ) , so it seems prudent to adopt the cluster abundance normalization until the discrepancy in the velocity data is resolved .",
    "based on the above discussion , a useful functional form for the density power spectrum is given by a cdm type transfer function with two free parameters , the amplitude @xmath161 and the shape parameter @xmath162 ( peacock & dodds 1996 ) .",
    "this is the model that will be adopted in computing predictions of ellipticity polarizations for cluster - abundance normalization .",
    "we shall use the fitting formulae in equations ( 47 - 49 ) of @xcite to compute @xmath16 as a function of @xmath8  their normalization is very close to the results of @xcite and pen ( 1996 ) , though a bit higher than that of @xcite .    before proceeding with the results for @xmath38 we consider the contribution to the integral from different ranges in @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] compares the contribution per logarithmic interval in wavenumber to @xmath163 and @xmath164 at @xmath138 , @xmath96 with the logarithmic contribution to @xmath165 , which is also an integral of the power spectrum over @xmath53 with a real space top - hat filter .",
    "all the distributions are normalized so that they peak at unity .",
    "one can see that the distribution of @xmath98 is broader and that of @xmath164 narrower than the corresponding @xmath165 distribution , but in general they sample very much the same scales .",
    "thus the optimal statistic to use in order to compare the normalization @xmath16 with other tracers is @xmath164 , @xmath74 at @xmath166 , @xmath75 .",
    "the comparison can then be made nearly independent of the shape of the power spectrum .    we need to choose a redshift distribution for the source galaxies in order to compute @xmath38 . at present",
    "this is spectroscopically known only for galaxies with magnitude in i below 23 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; cowie et al . 1996 ) , which have median redshift @xmath167 , while typical lensing observations reach several magnitudes deeper ( e.g. mould et al .",
    "hst observations of abell 2218 coupled with cluster mass reconstruction indicate that the median redshift increases from @xmath168 at r=22 to @xmath169 at r=25 ( kneib et al .",
    "there could however be a population even at redshift beyond 1 , as indicated by the detection of the shear around a @xmath170 cluster ( luppino & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "most of the results we present are for @xmath96 , but they can be adapted to any desired @xmath3 using the scalings of table 1 . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed that all the galaxies are at the same distance .",
    "this is the best possible case in the sense that it makes the distributions in @xmath53 space more narrow than for more realistic cases .",
    "fortunately the difference between our results and those using a different , more realistic distribution of source galaxies with the same median redshift is usually very small ( kaiser 1992 , villumsen 1996 ) .",

    "the thin solid curve is computed using the linear spectrum for the @xmath61 model . as expected from the results of figure [ ratio ]",
    ", it is only for @xmath144 that the linear and nonlinear curves start to coincide . for cluster - abundance normalization",
    ", the amplitude of ellipticity correlations very weakly depends on the mean density for a reasonable range of @xmath8 .",
    "the enhancement for low @xmath8 models from the growth and distance factors discussed in  2 nearly cancels out the @xmath181 dependence one might have expected from the term outside the integral in equation [ p ] . therefore one has to make subtler comparisons of the signal at small and large @xmath17 to break the degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",
    "this was discussed above following equation ( [ scalings - lambda ] ) .",
    "it indicates that comparing weak lensing measurements over different scales can more powerfully constrain @xmath8 than comparing the weak lensing amplitude with other tracers . for cobe normalization on the other hand",
    ", a detection of the correlated ellipticity with reasonable error bars can immediately constrain the cosmological model in question , but of course there might still remain several different models which equally well fit the data .    the effect of choice of statistic , shape of the power spectrum , and the redshift of source galaxies",

    "the fourier space quantity @xmath164 on the other hand receives contributions only from scales smaller than @xmath186 and therefore decreases on very small scales for realistic power spectra .",
    "the shape of the @xmath81 curve is very similar to that of @xmath98 , and for @xmath187 , @xmath81 is well approximated by @xmath188 .",
    "figure [ shape ] compares @xmath38 for the @xmath189 cdm spectrum to the @xmath127 spectrum used in the rest of the figures .",
    "the upper and lower set of curves are for @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively .",
    "since the @xmath189 spectrum has more power at small scales , it leads to a larger @xmath114 at small @xmath17 .",
    "the curves cross around @xmath192 , but the difference is not large for @xmath193 .",

    "the models shown are the same as in the cluster - abundance normalized panel of figure [ pvstheta1 ] .",
    "as shown in table 1 , @xmath25 increases with @xmath3 fastest for the @xmath12models .",
    "so far we have only discussed the importance of nonlinear effects on the second order statistic , which as we have seen increases the signal above the values predicted by linear calculations .",
    "nonlinear evolution however also changes the distribution function of correlated ellipticity or magnification .",
    "in particular , the tails of distribution grow and become asymmetric , reflecting the nonlinear growth of perturbations into small and overdense objects .",
    "this leads to a distribution of magnification which is skewed toward positive values .",
    "such skewness is of interest for determining cosmological parameters by itself ( bernardeau et al .",
    "1996 ) , but also affects the inference of cosmological parameters from the measurements of 2-point statistics . if the distribution of polarization at a given angular scale @xmath17 can be assumed to be normal distributed then the usual results from gaussian statistics apply .",
    "for example a single measurement of polarization amplitude within a circular aperture has a rayleigh probability distribution @xmath196 , which has exponentially suppressed tail and from which the limits on cosmological parameters can be derived analytically .",
    "several independent measurements can be easily combined and only a few observations suffice to obtain strong limits on cosmological parameters . if , on the other hand , the distribution is strongly non - gaussian so that the tails of distribution are important then one can not use these simple arguments to derive the limits and a larger set of measurements ( a `` fair sample '' ) is needed to sufficiently sample the tails so that the variance converges to a true value . at the same time , higher order statistics become easier to measure and can provide further tests of cosmological parameters .    for measurements of density perturbations a simple criterion of where the nonlinear effects become important is @xmath197 , so for scales above @xmath198 mpc the universe is in the linear regime and gaussian statistic can be used . for smaller scales",
    "nonlinear effects become important which leads to deviations from a normal distribution even if the initial field was gaussian . for projected quantities such as shear and magnification",
    "the answer is not so simple .",
    "the projection integrates over all the scales , so there will always be contribution from very small and thus very nonlinear scales . on the other hand , projection will reduce the deviations from a gaussian distribution because of the central limit theorem : if we sum over sufficiently large number of deflectors the final distribution will be a gaussian regardless of the probability distribution of individual deflectors .",
    "we thus expect that the nonlinear effects will be more important for small angles and for bright ( nearby ) background galaxies .    to obtain a more quantitative answer we calculated the skewness of local convergence @xmath199 using second order perturbation theory .",
    "skewness for local convergence does not vanish as in the case of ellipticity ( bernardeau et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the second moments of @xmath200 and @xmath114 are the same and so one may expect the higher order moments of convergence to be indicative of the nonlinear effects on the ellipticity distribution as well",
    ". note that the quantity @xmath201 differs from the quantity @xmath202 used by bernardeau et al .",
    "the latter is defined so that it is independent of the amplitude of power spectrum in the second order perturbation theory , while @xmath201 is a more useful variable to quantify the deviations from the gaussianity . as discussed in the appendix ,",
    "second order perturbation theory should be approximately valid in the regime of interest here , between 1 to 1@xmath203 .",
    "second order perturbation theory accurately estimates the skewness over a much wider range of scales than it does the variance . only on the smallest scales it underestimates the skewness , but typically not more than a factor of two , as shown by n - body simulations ( colombi , bouchet & hernquist 1996 ) . using the expressions derived in appendix",
    "( see also bernardeau et al .",
    "1996 ) we can compute the value of @xmath201 for any of the models discussed in this paper .",
    "figure [ skew1 ] presents the distribution of @xmath201 as a function of @xmath17 for 3 different redshifts in 3 different models : flat model with @xmath204 , curvature and cosmological constant models , both with @xmath172 and @xmath205 ( this is very close to the cluster - abundance normalization ) . in all the models we use @xmath127 .    for simplicity we will choose @xmath206 as the value where the distribution becomes non - gaussian . for background galaxies at @xmath207",
    "we find that the distribution is non - gaussian even at @xmath208 in the flat model , where the polarization signal is only 0.25% . at @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath190 the corresponding values are @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "for curvature and cosmological constant dominated models the non - gaussian effects are even more important because of higher normalization at @xmath15mpc , although the effect is offset by the longer radial distance to a given redshift .",
    "the conclusion is that in most of the observationally interesting regime the nongaussian effects will be quite important .",
    "while this complicates the issue of how large a fair sample should be , it also implies that skewness will be fairly easy to measure with a reasonably small sample . because @xmath211 depends sensitively on @xmath8 but not on the amplitude of the power spectrum ( bernardeau et al . 1996 ) this test may become a promising way to determine @xmath8 .",
    "the analytical approach presented above provides only a limited view of the properties of ellipticity distribution .",
    "for example , such an analysis can not answer whether skewness is produced by a few outlying points generated by rare clusters , in which case a rather large sample would be needed to sample these properly . for a quantitative estimate of what constitutes a fair sample for measuring the variance",
    "requires therefore knowledge of at least the fourth moment .",
    "such estimates of a fair sample for measuring the second and third moment can be made more directly by examining the distribution of correlated ellipticities in n - body simulations ( wambsganss , cen & ostriker 1996 ) .",
    "weak gravitational lensing has several advantages over other probes of large scale structure .",
    "it is directly sensitive to the underlying mass distribution and is therefore independent of biasing , which has plagued many of the cosmological tests based on the distribution of galaxies .",
    "while peculiar velocities in principle similarly probe the dark matter distribution directly , in practice they suffer because of large observational errors and various biases associated with these .",
    "this is the main reason why higher order statistics of velocity fields have not provided strong constraints on cosmological models .",
    "gravitational lensing could provide a much cleaner way of performing power spectrum and higher order statistical tests , provided that one can overcome observational difficulties and reach the 1% level of polarization , quite feasible with the new generation of composite ccd cameras .",
    "for a filled survey with an area @xmath212 and @xmath213 measured galaxies the noise variance in @xmath74 is given by @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the typical intrinsic shear for a single galaxy .",
    "although one has to average over sufficient number of galaxies to reach this level of signal , this is not a severe limitation for sufficiently deep exposures with several hundred thousand galaxies per square degree , so on degree scales the signal to noise is of the order of 100 ( kaiser 1996 ; fig .",
    "[ sn ] ) and in fact sampling variance ( finite number of independent areas of size @xmath216 ) is more important than noise on large angles . on smaller scales the noise increases ( proportional to @xmath217 ) , but the signal also increases nearly as rapidly , so that the overall signal to noise remains approximately flat down to @xmath136 scales in open and cosmological constant models and slowly decreases in flat models ( fig .",
    "[ sn ] ) . based on this",
    "it appears there should be sufficient power present in a survey of this size to measure the signal even on arcminute scales with a high statistical accuracy , so a comparison between small and large scales to constrain @xmath8 would indeed be feasible , provided that the systematic effects can be kept under control .",
    "the other limitation at present is that the redshift distribution of background galaxies is unknown beyond @xmath218 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; cowie et al . 1996 ) .",
    "new observations with keck will be able to extend this spectroscopically up to @xmath219 ( e.g. lowenthal et al .",
    "1996 ) and even beyond , if spectra of magnified arcs are measured .",
    "in addition , weak lensing on high redshift clusters can be used to constrain the redshift distribution of faint galaxies without measuring their redshifts , although at present there appears to be some controversy over whether the faintest galaxies are predominantly around or below @xmath62 ( kneib et al .",
    "1995 ) or above that ( luppino & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "finally , the best hope to constrain their redshift distribution may lie in the photometric redshifts technique ( conolly et al .",
    "1995 ; sawicki , lin & yee 1996 ) .",
    "this would allow one to perform such precision tests as the growth of power spectrum with redshift , needed to estimate the value of @xmath11 .",
    "for example , based on hubble deep field observations , sawicki et al .",
    "1996 find that the redshift distribution of @xmath220 galaxies is bimodal , with a large contribution of ( predominantly blue ) galaxies between redshifts 2 - 3 , while at @xmath221 most of the galaxies are below @xmath62 . in both cases",
    "the weak lensing signal to noise with these limiting magnitudes would be comparable to the one in fig .",
    "[ sn ] , so in principle by comparing the signals in the two magnitude bins it would be straightforward to deduce the value of @xmath11 .",
    "the caveat is that the faintest galaxies in hdf appear to be very irregular and small , so it is not clear whether weak lensing analysis from the ground could be performed on these objects .",
    "while more investigation is needed along these lines , there appears to be a real promise of measuring cosmological parameters with future weak lensing observations .",
    "we have analyzed theoretical predictions for weak lensing ellipticity correlations over a broad range of angles and for a variety of cosmological models .",
    "our principal conclusions are the following :    \\a ) the amplitude of the rms ellipticity varies between 4 - 6% on arcminute scales to 0.5 - 1% on degree scales for background galaxies at @xmath96 and grows as @xmath222 . in this range the amplitude only weakly depends on the value of cosmological parameters if cluster abundance ( or velocity flows ) normalization is adopted .",
    "a single measurement of weak lensing amplitude on @xmath223 will provide a determination of @xmath224 which can be compared with the cluster - abundance or velocity flow predictions . because these tracers all scale similarly with @xmath8 this will not provide an independent determination of @xmath8 , for which a more complicated analysis will be needed .",
    "\\b ) nonlinear effects are important for second order statistics on scales below @xmath225 and enhance the signal expected from linear theory .",
    "this enhancement can be up to a factor of two on arcminute scales . from this",
    "it follows that the signal to noise does not decrease as rapidly on small scales as expected from linear theory and is in fact approximately flat in certain models from arcminute to degree scales ( see figure [ sn ] ) .",
    "therefore measurements over this whole angular range should be pursued , especially since they provide complementary information .",
    "the interpretation of cosmological models is more cleanly addressed on large angular scales , where nonlinear effects are negligible and the distribution function is primordial .",
    "small angular scales can provide insight on the nonlinear evolution of perturbations .",
    "if our current understanding of the latter is correct then combining measurements on large and small angular scales will help break the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters , because of different scalings in the linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "the ellipticity on small angles measures @xmath226 , on large angles it measures @xmath227 , while the variation with @xmath3 can constrain @xmath11 .",
    "thus , to obtain model independent measurements of the cosmological parameters it is necessary to measure the signal over a range of angles and source redshifts .",
    "\\c ) nonlinear effects on the distribution of ellipticity are significant on scales below @xmath209 and imply that gaussian statistics can not be applied to the data .",
    "this means that a larger sample will be required to measure second order statistics than expected from a gaussian distribution .",
    "conversely , skewness and other higher moments will be easy to measure and may provide a strong test of cosmological parameters independent of the tests above .    in conclusion ,",
    "weak lensing has the promise to become the next testing ground for cosmological theories .",
    "the expected signal to noise is above unity over a large range of angles and limiting magnitudes .",
    "this should allow one to test sensitively the spectrum of density perturbations and its evolution in time , in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes .",

    "the effect of the deflection angle on the photon transverse position must however include the curvature effects . in practice",
    "this means that one only needs to know how to solve triangles using the spherical , euclidean or hyperboloid trigonometry ( figure [ fig_appb ] ) . because the only observable photon direction is that at the observer s position we will propagate photons relative to their final direction ( i.e. backwards in time ) .",
    "we will also adopt a small deflection angle approximation , because one does not expect large deflection angles due to the lensing , but the expressions can be generalized to remove this restriction . in this approximation the transverse derivatives in equation ( [ dndl ] ) can be approximated with the transverse derivatives with respect to the observed direction of the photon or with respect to any other fiducial direction that has a small angular separation with the photon ( for example the unperturbed direction to the source ) . in this plane approximation",

    "the shear tensor can be diagonalized and decomposed into its trace @xmath265 and ellipticity ( or polarization ) @xmath266 given by @xmath267 while trace @xmath268 magnifies ( or demagnifies ) the images of galaxies , ellipticity @xmath24 stretches the images and can be observed by averaging over a sufficient number of galaxies so that the noise caused by the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies becomes smaller than the signal .",
    "the simplest average is the one within a circular window of radius @xmath17 , which can be written in fourier space as @xmath269 we decomposed the wavevector into the radial component @xmath270 and the 2-dimensional transverse component @xmath271 with the amplitude @xmath272 .",
    "we introduced the variables @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath271 .",
    "the integral over @xmath275 can be readily performed to give @xmath276 where @xmath41 .",
    "we may now employ the small angle approximation ( limber 1956 ) , which is valid in the limit where the radial window function is broad compared to the typical wavelength that contributes to the integral . in this limit",
    "only the modes perpendicular to the radial direction will contribute to the integral , all the others being suppressed because of cancellation of positive and negative fluctuations along the line of sight .",
    "this allows one to put @xmath277 . with this approximation one",
    "obtains for rms ellipticity amplitude @xmath278 @xmath279 ensemble average can be expressed in terms of power spectrum of potential @xmath280 or density @xmath281 , @xmath282 where power spectrum @xmath283 and expansion factor @xmath19 depend on time . integrating over the dirac @xmath284 function and over the radial component of wavevector",
    "we finally obtain equation ( [ p ] ) , which gives the rms amplitude of polarization .",
    "the same expression can also be used for rms amplitude of magnification @xmath200 .",
    "the rms amplitude for each of the two ellipticity components is simply @xmath285 of the total .    because skewness of ellipticity vanishes for symmetry reasons we will use skewness of local convergence as an estimate of the nongaussian nature of ellipticity distribution . calculating it proceeds along the same lines as for the variance ( bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "it is defined as an ensemble average of the third moment of the mean magnification , @xmath286 ^ 3 \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] in linear theory the 3-point correlation function vanishes , so one needs to go beyond the linear approximation to obtain a nonvanishing value . in second order perturbation theory the density field is given by @xmath287.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the time dependence is all in the growth factors of @xmath288 , which is calculated using linear theory ( neglecting the extremely weak dependence of @xmath289 on @xmath235 , bouchet et al .",
    "ensemble averaging of skewness gives 6 identical terms , which after integrating over the radial wavevectors leads to the following expression , @xmath290 the integrals can be further simplified using similar manipulations as in bernardeau ( 1995 ) , which leads to the expression ( see also bernardeau et al .",

    "\\label{skew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression was used in  4 to evaluate the importance of nonlinear evolution on the distribution function of polarization .",
    "several approximations have been employed in obtaining the result above , which limit its validity .",
    "second order perturbation theory results are only valid in the domain where density perturbations are not much larger than unity , so on very small scales a more involved calculation would be needed .",
    "however , these corrections are typically not more than a factor of two . because our purpose is to estimate at which scale",
    "the nongaussian effects become important second order perturbation theory suffices . another approximation is the use of small angle approximation , which leads to corrections on angular scales above @xmath209 ( bernardeau 1995 ) . in the regime of main interest for us , which is between @xmath292",
    "this is not an important correction .",
    "finally , expression ( [ skew ] ) neglects the deviation of the photon trajectory from the unperturbed path , which also contributes at the second order .",
    "this correction is less important than the main term used in equation ( [ skew ] ) and can be neglected ( bernardeau et al .",
