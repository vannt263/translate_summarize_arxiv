    "temperature of the sample holder , which is weakly coupled to the dilution refrigerator , was accurately controlled by a @xmath56 thermometer and a resistive heater .",
    "no measurable thermal drift of the tip position occurred in our experiments between the base temperature of 50mk and the highest measured temperature of about 6 k. to perform spectroscopy , the stm pt / ir tip was aligned at the center of the sample hall bridge .",
    "the differential conductance of the tunnel junction , @xmath57 , was then measured by a lock - in amplifier with an alternative voltage modulation of @xmath58 added to the ramped bias voltage thus allowing to probe the local dos .",
    "the energy resolution of the spectroscopy can be described by the effective temperature , @xmath59 , used to fit the superconducting spectra with the theoretical bcs dos .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath60 and the sample thermometer is due to unfiltered electromagnetic radiations which heat the electrons and from voltage noise generated by room temperature electronics  @xcite .",
    "the tunneling current was @xmath61 for millivolts bias voltage yielding a tunneling resistance in the @xmath62 range , which is much higher than the film resistance ( @xmath63 ) between the stm junction and the contact .",
    "this ensures a negligible voltage drop across the resistive film in series with the stm junction during spectroscopy above @xmath1 . for statistics analysis of the gap distribution we used the practical definition of the gap @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electron charge and @xmath66 was defined as the bias voltage at which the numerically computed @xmath67 is maximum at the gap edge",

    "<S> * the most profound effect of disorder on electronic systems is the localization of the electrons transforming an otherwise metallic system into an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> if the metal is also a superconductor then , at low temperatures , disorder can induce a dramatic transition from a superconducting into an insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding question is whether the route to insulating behavior proceeds via the direct localization of cooper pairs or , alternatively , by a two - step process in which the cooper pairing is first destroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons . </S>",
    "<S> here we address this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly disordered , amorphous , superconductor by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements reveal that , in the vicinity of the superconductor - insulator transition , the coherence peaks in the one - particle density of states disappear while the superconducting gap remains intact indicating the presence of localized cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide the first direct evidence that the transition in our system is driven by cooper pair localization . *    </S>",
    "<S> although superconductivity and anderson localization lead to the opposite extremes of conductivity at low temperature ( @xmath0 ) , both are due to delicate quantum effects . in superconductors , electrons are bound in cooper pairs that condense into a zero - resistance , macroscopic , quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , disorder induces quantum localization of the electron s wave - function that transforms a metal into an insulator with diverging resistance .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that an increasing level of disorder can cause a transition from a superconductor into an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> understanding how the disorder drives this transition is important for many quantum systems such as amorphous superconductors  @xcite , superconducting nanowires  @xcite , high critical - temperatures superconductors  @xcite and ultra - cold atomic gases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this transition is regarded as one of the prototypical quantum phase - transitions driven by disorder in a many - body system , a subject that acquired significant theoretical attention recently . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    for a moderate level of disorder </S>",
    "<S> the anderson theorem  @xcite , which is based on the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity  @xcite , states that the critical temperature of superconductivity , @xmath1 , remains unchanged . in order to affect @xmath1 significantly a much stronger disorder , at a level that usually causes localization of the electronic wave functions , </S>",
    "<S> is needed . as a result the suppression of superconductivity is theoretically expected to be accompanied by a transition to an insulating state  @xcite .    the route to the total destruction of superconductivity by disorder can follow two distinct paths . in the first , and more obvious , path disorder - enhanced coulomb repulsion eliminates cooper - pairing before the onset of localization . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing poor metal becomes an insulator upon a further increase of disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this case one expects to find an insulating regime similar to that found in other , non - superconducting , metals driven to become insulators by strong disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> the second , and more intriguing , path is where the superconductor itself undergoes the transition into an insulating state with only minimal suppression of cooper - pairing . for such materials ,  @xcite there are two main theoretical mechanisms that have been suggested to explain the transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these mechanisms differ by their emphasis on the relative importance of processes on short and long scales . in non - granular materials , which are the focus of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the short length scale is set by the coherence length of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the first of these mechanisms attributes the superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) to the divergence of phase fluctuations at large scales  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of this theory are in agreement with resistivity measurements in quench - condensed bi films  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second suggested mechanism  @xcite emphasizes the role of the fractal nature of the electron wave - functions at short length scales . extending earlier works  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this theory predicts that superconductivity at high disorder is maintained by a fragile coherence between a small set of preformed cooper - pairs that are characterized by an anomalously large binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in the vicinity of the sit , both the insulator and the superconductor are composed of these preformed cooper - pairs that either localize , leading to an insulating state , or condense into a coherent zero - resistance state .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of preformed cooper - pairs has been previously inferred from transport measurements findings such as the giant magneto - resistance peak and activated resistance in the magnetic field - tuned sit of indium - oxide ( ino )  @xcite or thin titanium - nitride ( tin ) films  @xcite and , more recently , from magneto - resistance oscillations with half flux - quantum periodicity in insulating bi films patterned with a honeycomb array of holes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while these observations are in agreement with the presence of preformed cooper - pairs at the sit  @xcite they only constitute indirect evidence for their existence .        </S>",
    "<S> the existence of cooper - pairs at short length - scales is more directly revealed by the observation of a superconducting gap in the density of states ( dos )  @xcite using scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) spectroscopy  @xcite . in good bcs superconductors global coherence sets in at @xmath1 . below @xmath1 , a dos </S>",
    "<S> suppression begins below the gap energy , @xmath2 , and the lost spectral weight appears as distinct peaks at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these coherence peaks are closely linked to the emergence of a long - range superconducting state . in the case of preformed cooper - pairs without global coherence , </S>",
    "<S> it is theoretically expected  @xcite that the spectrum will remain gapped but the coherence peaks will be missing . only when global superconductivity sets - in , the coherence peaks re - emerge . </S>",
    "<S> the height of these coherence peaks is predicted to fluctuate strongly from one location to another .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we report on a systematic spectroscopic study of the local properties of superconductivity in highly disordered amorphous ino films close to the sit . </S>",
    "<S> our results , obtained using an stm mounted in a custom - made dilution refrigerator capable of a base temperature of 50 mk , provide the first direct evidence for the existence of preformed cooper - pairs along with their localization .    </S>",
    "<S> * localization of preformed cooper pairs *    the main feature of our results is the existence of two qualitatively different @xmath0-evolutions of the dos spectra as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpseudogap]a and  [ figpseudogap]b . for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> is indicated by the black dashed trace in the figures ) , both @xmath0-evolutions exhibit very similar behavior with a low - energy dos suppression that deepens as @xmath0 is lowered towards @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar dos suppression above @xmath1 has been seen in other superconductors and has been dubbed the pseudogap  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 is lowered further , the two sets of spectra evolve in a distinctly different fashion . as coherence sets in at @xmath4 , the spectrum of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpseudogap]a develops the familiar bcs coherence peaks at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 is reduced below @xmath4 the coherence peaks increase in size , while the dos at @xmath5 is suppressed further and seems to vanish as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , although a full gap does develop in the spectrum of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpseudogap]b , with a similar magnitude and a vanishing dos at low energy , the accompanying coherence peaks are conspicuously absent . </S>",
    "<S> the contrast ( below @xmath1 ) and similarities ( above @xmath1 ) between the two types of spectra are highlighted by the corresponding plots of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figpseudogap]c and [ figpseudogap]d , where more complete @xmath0-evolutions of the spectra are displayed .    the similarity between the @xmath0-evolution ( above @xmath1 ) , as well as the gap magnitude , of both types of spectra indicate that they share the same physical origin . </S>",
    "<S> because the unique shape of the bcs tunneling spectra are known to be the result of the cooper attraction between electrons , we are led to conclude that the same must be true for the locations where the coherence peaks at the gap edges are missing from the spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of two types of spectra , similar to those observed in this work , was reported in the numerical study of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model with on - site disorder by ghosal _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , they found that the regions where coherence peaks are absent are characterized by rapid fluctuations of the potential that strongly localize the electron states . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , they concluded that some of the cooper - pairs that are formed there are unable to participate in the macroscopic coherent state comprising the condensate .    to develop a quantitative understanding of superconductivity in this high - disorder limit we turn to more recent analytic calculations that take into account the fractal nature of the electronic wave functions close to the localization threshold  @xcite . in this theory a pair of electrons occupying a localized state @xmath7 experience two effects : their net mutual attraction and coherent pair - hopping to neighboring states . </S>",
    "<S> the observed spectral gap @xmath8 at a given location contains two distinct contributions : @xmath9 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is a bcs - like excitation energy , determined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the single electron state energy of the @xmath7-th state and @xmath13 is the local pairing field in this problem . in conventional bcs superconductors </S>",
    "<S> the pairing field is uniform and coincides with the single particle gap . </S>",

    "<S> it results from the cooper attraction between two electrons populating the same localized state and it is inversely proportional to the volume of that state  @xcite . because of the fractality of the wave functions the values of @xmath15 are large and fluctuate strongly for nearly - critical wavefunctions @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate conclusion of this theoretical analysis  @xcite is that a global superconducting state survives rather deep into the localized band , up to the region where an average @xmath17 strongly exceeds typical @xmath13 . in this regime </S>",

    "<S> the absence , down to our lowest @xmath0 , of coherence peaks in the gapped dos at some locations is the fingerprint of preformed cooper pairs that remain localized by the strong disorder and do not participate in the condensate .    * </S>",

    "<S> @xmath24 is the tunneling conductance at the peak energy and @xmath25 is the minimum tunneling conductance for an energy just above the gap . in order to study the dependence on disorder </S>",

    "<S> we begin by inspecting the distribution of @xmath2 . for the low disorder sample ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figstat]a ) , @xmath2 is normally distributed ( black solid line in the figure ) with an average @xmath30 and standard deviation @xmath31 . the increase in disorder ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figstat]c ) leads to a somewhat lower @xmath32 @xmath33ev but a larger @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening of the gap distribution with disorder is similar to that observed previously in tin films  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a central feature of our results is that the smooth evolution of the gap distribution with disorder is accompanied by a very sharp , qualitative , change of the coherence - peak height - distribution , @xmath35 , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figstat]b and [ figstat]d . </S>",
    "<S> while the less disordered sample shows a well - defined maximum in the @xmath35 distribution function at @xmath36 , in the more disordered sample , both the maximum of @xmath35 and most of its weight are shifted towards @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that with increasing level of disorder , coherent spectra are replaced by those in which coherent peaks are missing . </S>",
    "<S> close to the sit , this results in a very inhomogeneous state with superconductivity occupying a small fraction of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining part of the sample is insulating ( although the gap in its dos is also due to cooper pairing ) and its relative area grows with increasing disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the fact that incoherently - gapped regions proliferate upon the increase of disorder ( see fig .  [ figstat ] ) implies that the absence of coherence peaks can not be a result of surface contamination as there is no reason to expect an abrupt increase of contamination level as the sit is approached .     computed in our model for slightly different disorders characterized by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters were chosen so that the transition temperature becomes @xmath40 in the limit of very low disorder and changes only by a factor 0.9 between @xmath39 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that in contrast to the moderate effect on @xmath1 , the distribution functions differ dramatically between these two cases . ]    theoretically , the broad statistical distribution of the parameters in our samples is a direct consequence of the fractality of the wave functions , expected to lead to a large and strongly fluctuating values of @xmath15 for nearly - critical wavefunctions @xmath16  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the difference in the distribution functions displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figstat]a , c and [ figstat]b , d is due to the fact that gap magnitudes are controlled by @xmath15 while peak heights are determined by @xmath22 . to compare to the theoretical predictions we show , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figlocfield ] , the computed distribution functions for two levels of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> far from the sit , the distribution function of @xmath22 is relatively narrow and it gradually broadens upon increasing the disorder . in that regime , </S>",
    "<S> the typical local field @xmath41 is roughly equal to the average one as shown by the blue curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figlocfield ] . </S>",
    "<S> closer to the sit , the distribution function changes dramatically : it acquires a power - law shape @xmath42 ( see red curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figlocfield ] ) with exponent @xmath43 decreasing upon the growth of disorder ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed peak height distributions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figstat]b and d conform well to the former and latter situations .        despite the inhomogeneous nature of superconductivity in our samples </S>",
    "<S> , we find that nearly all the spectra are characterized by anomalously large @xmath44 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figspectrotransport]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from the classical bcs value can be understood by noting that , in tunneling experiments , the quantity that is measured is the single - particle dos and the inferred @xmath2 is the minimal energy for a single electron , or hole , excitation . in strongly disordered superconductors @xmath2 is expected to be much larger than the pairing field , as observed by ghosal et al  @xcite in their numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore expects that , for increasing disorder , @xmath22 will progressively drop to zero , leading to a vanishing @xmath4 when approaching the sit while @xmath2 , whose main part is of incoherent  origin , will remain finite and may even increase . in other words , a local spectral gap due to cooper attraction can exist without global superconductivity leading in a natural way to the large @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is boltzmann constant ) .    * macroscopic quantum phase coherence probed at a local scale *    finally , to clarify how phase coherence is established in such an inhomogeneous superconducting state , we have studied the @xmath0 evolution of several spectra measured at different locations * r * and on samples with different @xmath4 . for each evolution , we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figspectrotransport]a @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the temperature below which coherence peaks start to grow ( see fig .  [ figspectrotransport]b ) versus the local @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> while this latter ratio can vary between 6.5 and 11.5 , @xmath47 remains nearly 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that peaks appear when and only when global superconductivity is established regardless of the local gap . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> our ino films behave very differently from granular superconductors where one would expect a constant @xmath50 and a macroscopic @xmath4 determined by the interplay of the charging and josephson energies in the array of grains  @xcite .    the appearance of coherence peaks at the same temperature where resistance is vanishing ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> figspectrotransport]b ) allows us a direct comparison between local and global measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially striking since both the gap magnitude and peak heights fluctuate very strongly across our samples , while local coherence peaks appear simultaneously at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this counter - intuitive behavior allows us to rule out a scenario where preformed cooper - pairs would condense locally at different temperatures above @xmath1 leading to independent superconducting droplets . </S>",
    "<S> for such an inhomogeneous sample , the zero resistance state appearing at @xmath1 would simply correspond to the percolation of these droplets . in a disordered system such as ours , because of their fractal nature , the electronic wave - functions spread far in the sample and therefore weakly overlap with a large number of neighboring states . at @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> these wavefunctions condense into a single superconducting state despite the local fluctuations of the pairing field @xmath22 . accordingly , coherence peaks emerge everywhere at @xmath1 but their height vary from place to place .    to conclude , we presented the evidence that electrons remain cooper paired at the sit in disordered ino films . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is driven by the increase in the number of incoherent pairs at the expense of the ones that participate in the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> close to the transition , on the superconducting side , @xmath2 fluctuates strongly indicating a spontaneously formed inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> the perseverance of single electron gap implies that very close to the transition on the insulating side , the transport is dominated by incoherent cooper pair hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the material in this regime might be very unusual and deserve further studies .    </S>",
    "<S> note that very recent numerical simulations  @xcite are consistent with our interpretation of the data . </S>"
