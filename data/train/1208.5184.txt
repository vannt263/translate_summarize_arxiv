    "tools of social network analysis ( sna ) have been subject of interest for theoretical as well as empirical study of social systems @xcite .",
    "a social network is a collection of people or groups interacting with each other and displaying complex features @xcite .",
    "tools of sna provide quantitative understanding for the human interaction of collective behavior .",
    "considerable research has been done on scientific collaboration networks @xcite , board of directors , movie - actor collaboration network @xcite and citation networks @xcite .",
    "the use of network analysis not only provides a global view of the system , it also shows the complete list of interactions . in the world of sports , individual players interact with each other and also with the players in the opponent team .",
    "it is therefore important to study the effect of interactions on performance of a player .    in recent years",
    "there has been an increase in study of quantitative analysis of individual performance involving team sports .",
    "time series analysis have been applied to football @xcite , baseball @xcite , basketball @xcite and soccer @xcite . quantifying the individual performance or ` quality ' of a player in any sport",
    "is a matter of great importance for the selection of team members in international competitions and is a topic of recent interest @xcite .",
    "a lot of negotiations are involved in the process of team - selection @xcite .",
    "studies have focussed on non - linear modeling techniques like neural networks to rate an individual s performance .",
    "for example , neural networks techniques were used to predict the performance of individual cricketer s based on their past performance @xcite .",
    "earlier tools of neural networks were used to model performance and rank ncaa college football teams @xcite , predicting javelin flights @xciteand to recognize patterns in table tennis and rowing @xcite .",
    "again , a model - free approach was developed to extract the outcome of a soccer match@xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the statistics of ball touches presents power - law tails and can be described by @xmath2-gamma distributions @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the study of complex networks have attracted a lot of research interests @xcite .",
    "the tools of complex network analysis have previously been applied to quantify individual brilliance in sports and also to rank the individuals based on their performance .",
    "for example , a network approach was developed to quantify the performance of individual players in soccer @xcite .",
    "network analysis tools have been applied to football@xcite and brazilian soccer players @xcite .",
    "successful and un - successful performance in water polo have been quantified using a network - based approach @xcite .",
    "head - to - head matchups between major league baseball pitchers and batters was studied as a bipartite network @xcite .",
    "more recently a network - based approach was developed to rank us college football teams @xcite , tennis players @xcite and cricket teams and captains @xcite .",
    "the complex features of numerous social systems are embedded in the inherent connectivity among system components @xcite . social network analysis ( sna )",
    "provides insight about the pattern of interaction among players and how it affects the success of a team @xcite .",
    "this article points out that how topological relations between players help better understanding of individuals who play for their teams and thus elucidate the individual importance and impact of a player . in this paper",
    "we apply the tools of network analysis to batsmen and bowlers in cricket and quantify the ` quality ' of an individual player .",
    "the advantage of network based approach is that it provides a different perspective for judging the excellence of a player .",
    "we take the case of individual performance of batsmen and bowlers in international cricket matches .",
    "cricket is a game played in most of the commonwealth countries .",
    "the international cricket council ( icc ) is the government body which controls the cricketing events around the globe .",
    "although icc includes @xmath3 member countries , only ten countries with ` test ' status - australia , england , india , south africa , new zealand , west indies , bangladesh , zimbabwe , pakistan and sri lanka play the game extensively .",
    "there are three versions of the game - ` test ' , one day international ( odi ) and twenty20 ( t20 ) formats .",
    "test cricket is the longest format of the game dating back to @xmath4 .",
    "usually it lasts for five days involving @xmath5 hours .",
    "shorter formats , lasting almost @xmath6 hours like odi started in @xmath7 and during late @xmath8 icc introduced the shortest format called t20 cricket which lasts approximately @xmath9 hours @xcite .    batsmen and bowlers in cricket are traditionally ranked according to their batting and bowling average respectively .",
    "judged by the batting average , sir donald bradman ( with an average of @xmath10 ) is regarded as the greatest batsman of all times .",
    "the next best batting average of @xmath11 is held by graeme pollock . even though most of the records held by bradman has been eclipsed by modern day batsmen like sachin tendulkar , brian lara , graham gooch ,",
    "mohammad yusuf , bradman s legacy still survives and generates debate among fans about his greatness relative to recent players like sir vivian richards , brian lara or sachin tendulkar .",
    "the question thus naturally arises is whether batting average of batsmen ( or bowling average of bowlers ) are the best measure for judging the worth of a batsman ( or a bowler ) .",
    "it was shown that rankings based on average suffer from two defects - @xmath12 consistency of scores across innings and @xmath13 value of runs scored by the player @xcite .",
    "however one should also consider the quality of bowling as well .",
    "for example according to bradman himself , the greatest innings he ever witnessed was that of mccabe s innings of @xmath14 at sydney in 1932 .",
    "the reason being it came against douglas jardine s body - line attack , widely regarded as one of the fiercest bowling attacks . similarly runs scored against west indian bowlers like michael holding , joel garner , malcom marshall and andy roberts deserve more credit than runs scored against low bowling attack of bangaldesh or zimbabwe . on similar arguments",
    "the wicket of top - order batsman is valued more than the wicket of a lower - order batsman .",
    "if a bowler claims the wicket of bradman , lara , richards or tendulkar , he gets more credit than if he dismiss any lower - order batsman . under the usual ranking scheme based on bowling average , _",
    "george lohmann _ of england has the lowest ( best ) bowling average ( @xmath15 ) in test cricket .",
    "however bowlers like _ george lohmann _ played under pitch conditions favoring fast bowlers . hence batting ( or bowling ) average",
    "does not serve as an efficient gauge for a batsman s ( or bowler s ) ability @xcite . against , this background , we propose a network based approach to quantify the ` quality ' of a batsman or bowler .",
    "the rest of the paper is presented as follows : in section 2 we propose the methods of link formation among the batsmen and bowlers . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we obtain data from the cricinfo website @xcite .",
    "the website contains the information of proceedings of all test matches played since @xmath4 and all odi matches from @xmath7 onwards .",
    "these include the runs scored by batsmen , wickets taken by bowlers , outcome of a game and also the information of the mode of dismissal of a batsman .",
    "we collect the data of player - vs - player for test cricket ( @xmath16 ) , odi cricket ( @xmath17 ) from the cricinfo website .",
    "the data of player - vs - player contains the information of runs scored by a batsman against every bowler he faced and how many times he was dismissed by the bowlers he faced .",
    "no information of player - vs - player is available for games played earlier than @xmath18 .",
    "we also collect the batting and bowling averages of players from the player s profile available in the cricinfo website . batting average of a batsman",
    "is defined as the total number of runs scored by the batsman divided by the number of times he was dismissed .",
    "thus higher batting average reflects higher ` quality ' of a batsman .",
    "similarly , bowling average is defined as the number of runs given by the bowler divided by the number of wickets claimed by him .",
    "thus lower bowling average indicates higher ability of the bowler .",
    "this information is used to generate the network of interaction among bowlers and batsmen in cricket matches .",
    "cricket is a bat - and - ball game played between two teams of @xmath19 players each . the team batting first tries to score as many runs as possible , while the other team bowls and fields , trying to dismiss the batsmen . at the end of an innings ,",
    "the teams switch between batting and fielding .",
    "this can be represented as a directed network of interaction of batsmen ( @xmath20 ) and bowlers ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "every node in @xmath21 has a directed link to all nodes in @xmath20 , provided the batsman and bowler face each other .",
    "the performance of a batsman is judged by the ` quality ' of runs scored and not the number of runs scored .",
    "hence runs scored against a bowler with lower bowling average carries more credit than runs scored against a bowler of less importance .",
    "we introduce a performance index of a batsman ( @xmath22 ) against a bowler given by the following equation    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the batting average of the batsman against the bowler he faced and @xmath25 refers to the career bowling average of the bowler .",
    "mathematically , batting average of the batsman ( @xmath24 ) is given by the ratio @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of runs scored against a bowler and @xmath28 is the number of times he was dismissed by the bowler . and",
    "@xmath28 are evaluated for test matches played between @xmath18 and @xmath29 and odi ( @xmath17 ) ] hence , if the career bowling average of a bowler is low ( indicating a good bowler ) , @xmath22 increases indicating that the batsman scored runs against quality opposition .",
    "we generate a weighted and directed network of bowlers to batsmen where weight of the link is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the network generated is thus based on the directed interaction of @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "for the weighted network the in - strength @xmath30 is defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is given by the weight of the directed link .",
    "so far , we have concentrated on the performance index of batsmen since @xmath18 .",
    "although the data for player - vs - player is not available for dates earlier than @xmath18 , one could quantify the overall performance of a bowler based on the dismissal record of batsmen .",
    "for example , the wicket of a top - order batsman always deserve more credit than the wicket of a tail - ender .",
    "thus the quality of dismissal serves as a measure for the greatness of a bowler .",
    "we define the quality index of bowler ( @xmath33 ) as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is defined as the number of times a batsman was dismissed by a particular bowler , @xmath36 refers to the career batting average of a batsman and @xmath25 indicates the career bowling average of a bowler .",
    "thus a greater value of @xmath33 indicates a better rank of a bowler .",
    "as before , we construct weighted and directed networks , this time the directed link pointing towards the bowlers .",
    "we evaluate the in - strength of the bowlers , which serves as a quantification of the ` quality ' of a bowler .",
    "the manner in which the game is played does nt allow us to compare the relative dominance of one batsman over another batsman or one bowler over another bowler . unlike in tennis , where each player has to compete directly with the opponent , in cricket a batsman is pitted against a bowler .",
    "hence it is very difficult to judge the relative superiority of a batsman ( bowler ) over another batsman ( bowler ) .",
    "the in - strength of a bowler or batsman conveys the ` quality ' of dismissal by a bowler or the ` quality ' of runs scored by a batsman .",
    "however , it does nt reflect the relative importance or popularity of one player over other players . to address this issue , in this section",
    "we generate one - mode projected network between batsmen who face the same bowler ( or bowlers who dismiss the same batsman ) in which the links are generated according to the method of gradient link formation .",
    "traditionally a gradient network is constructed as follows .",
    "consider a substrate network @xmath37 .",
    "each node @xmath38 in the network is assigned with a random number @xmath39 which describes the ` potential ' of the node .",
    "gradient network is constructed by directed links that point from each node to the nearest neighbor with highest potential @xcite . here",
    "we take a slightly different route to construct the projected network .    in figure",
    "[ fig : network00 ] we demonstrate the generation of the one - mode projected network according to the gradient scheme of link formation .",
    "first we consider the substrate network of batsmen and bowlers according to the dismissal records .",
    "the thickness of the edge is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "thus if batsman @xmath38 is dismissed by bowlers a and c , then bowlers a and c are connected .",
    "we evaluate the in - strength @xmath30 of the nodes a and c. the in - strength acts a ` potential ' for each bowler .",
    "we construct gradient links between two bowlers along the steepest ascent , where the weight of the directed link is the difference of the in - strength of two nodes . thus weighted and directed links",
    "are formed between two bowlers if they dismiss the same batsman .",
    "we repeat this procedure for all the nodes in the substrate network and a resultant one - mode projected network is formed .",
    "additionally we introduce a constraint , in which two bowlers are linked only if they are contemporary .",
    "thus b and d are not linked in the gradient scheme since they are not contemporary players .",
    "we apply the same method of gradient link formation on batsmen , where the weight of each link in the substrate network is proportional to the @xmath22 .",
    "the weight @xmath40 of a gradient - link is given as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 are the in - strength of two nodes @xmath38 and @xmath43 .",
    "the projected network thus highlights the relative importance of a player over other .",
    "we construct the substrate network of batsmen and bowlers for test cricket and odi cricket and construct the projected network of players .",
    "next we apply the pagerank algorithm on the resultant projected network and evaluate the importance of each player . in figure",
    "[ fig : network0](a ) we show a subgraph of the substrate network of batsmen and bowlers in odi ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the projected network of bowlers is generated if they dismiss the same batsman ( _ wasim akram _ ) ( see figure  [ fig : network0](b ) ) . in the same way one can construct projected network of batsmen who are dismissed by _",
    "wasim akram_.      we quantify the importance or ` popularity ' of a player with the use of a complex network approach and evaluating the pagerank score , originally developed by brin and page @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the process is described by the system of coupled equations    @xmath44    where @xmath40 is the weight of a link and @xmath45 = @xmath46 is the out - strength of a link .",
    "@xmath47 is the pagerank score assigned to team @xmath38 and represents the fraction of the overall `` influence '' sitting in the steady state of the diffusion process on vertex @xmath38 ( @xcite ) . @xmath48 $ ] is a control parameter that awards a ` free ' popularity to each player and @xmath49 is the total number of players in the network .",
    "the term @xmath50 represents the portion of the score received by node @xmath38 in the diffusion process obeying the hypothesis that nodes redistribute their entire credit to neighboring nodes . the term @xmath51 stands for a uniform redistribution of credit among all nodes .",
    "the term @xmath52 serves as a correction in the case of the existence nodes with null out - degree , which otherwise would behave as sinks in the diffusion process .",
    "it is to be noted that the pagerank score of a player depends on the scores of all other players and needs to be evaluated at the same time . to implement the pagerank algorithm in the directed and weighted network , we start with a uniform probability density equal to @xmath53 at each node of the network .",
    "next we iterate through eq .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) and obtain a steady - state set of pagerank scores for each node of the network . finally , the values of the pagerank score are sorted to determine the rank of each player .",
    "according to tradition , we use a uniform value of @xmath54 .",
    "this choice of @xmath2 ensures a higher value of pagerank scores @xcite .",
    "in general it is difficult to get analytical solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) @xcite .",
    "although in the simplest case of a single tournament an analytical solution for values of @xmath55 was determined @xcite , in cricket such a situation is not possible since it is a team game .",
    "the values of @xmath47s are evaluated recursively by setting @xmath56 .",
    "then we iterate eq .",
    "( [ eq : pg ] ) until a steady - state of values is reached .",
    "d    in this section , we explore the in - strength distribution of the weighted and directed networks . the in - strength of a node is an indication of the performance of an individual against the opponent team member .",
    "thus a greater value of in - strength indicates a better the performance of the individual . in fig",
    "[ fig : network2 ] we plot the cumulative in - strength distribution of batsmen and bowlers in test cricket and odi cricket .",
    "the in - strength distribution reflects the topology of the network and how the players interact with each other . as show in fig",
    "[ fig : network2](a ) , the in - strength distribution decays slowly for smaller values of in - strength ( @xmath57 ) . for values higher than @xmath58 ,",
    "the in - strength distribution decays at a much faster rate .",
    "this is in contrast with the in - strength distribution of bowlers ( fig  [ fig : network2](b ) ) , where the decay is slow .",
    "the reason being that all bowlers have to bat once the top order batsmen have been dismissed , thus establishing more links for the batsmen .",
    "however not all batsmen are specialist bowlers , which leads to low connections for bowlers . as mentioned above the in - strength of a batsman reflects the performance of a batsman in terms of quality of runs scored . in table  [ tab : table1 ] we list the top @xmath59 batsmen in test cricket between @xmath18 and @xmath29 .",
    "the batsmen are ranked according to their in - strength .",
    "we observe that _ k. c. sangakkara _ of sri lanka occupies the top spot followed by india s _ s. r. tendulkar _ with australia s _",
    "r. t. ponting _ and south africa s _",
    "j. h. kallis _ occupying the third and fourth spot respectively .",
    "_ r. dravid _ of india occupies the fifth position .",
    "we compare the in - strength rank with the pagerank score and batting average of batsmen for runs scored between @xmath18 and @xmath29 .",
    "additionally we list the best ever cricket rating received by a batsman between @xmath18 and @xmath29 . * in figure",
    "[ fig : corr1](a , b ) we compare the correlation of ranks obtained from in - strength and pagerank algorithm with batting average .",
    "we observe that ranks obtained from batting average is positively correlated with in - strength rank and pagerank score*. judged by the batting average and the icc points we observe that _ b. c. lara _ of west indies emerge as the most successful batsman in test cricket between @xmath18 and @xmath29 .",

    "australia s _",
    "g. d. mcgrath _ , who has been considered one of the best fast bowlers in cricket holds a better average than that of his immediate predecessors .",
    "however his in - strength rank and pagerank score indicates that his quality of dismissal were not better than _ muralitharan _ or _",
    "warne_. this leads to the possible question - are bowling averages the best indicator of a bowler s ability ? . in our all time top @xmath59 list",
    "we observe that england s _",

    "_ s. f. barnes _ too enjoyed favorable pitch conditions .",
    "the batsmen playing in such pitches usually averaged lower than the recent batsmen .",
    "hence for players like _",
    "s. f. barnes _ , the @xmath33 is low which in turn affects his in - strength . however , his pagerank score his higher than most of the modern age bowlers indicating his relative ` popularity ' or supremacy over other bowlers .",

    "m. muralitharan _ heads the list with @xmath73 wickets , with _",

    "there are few surprises in the list .",
    "india s _ a. b. agarkar _ is placed above in comparison to _ n. kapil dev _ ( ind ) , _ c. e. l. ambrose _ ( wi ) or _ c. a. walsh _ ( wi ) whom cricket experts consider as better bowlers .",
    "however , what goes in favor of _",
    "b. agarkar _ is the ` quality ' of wickets he took .",
    "thus even though he went for runs and did nt have a long career , he was able to dismiss most of the batsmen with good average . * in figure",
    "[ fig : corr2](c , d ) we compare the ranks obtained from in - strength and pagerank with bowling average .",
    "we observe that ranking schemes obtained from pagerank ( and in - strength ) are anti - correlated with the bowling average .",
    "* this is not surprising in the sense that bowling average is not a proper way of judging a player s performance .",
    "also in the odis , there has been a practice of bringing in part - time bowlers who have low - averages .",
    "this is paradoxical in the sense that it indicates part - time bowlers are better than the regular bowlers .",
    "we find that our scheme provides sensible results that are in agreement with the points provided by icc.*the rankings provided by icc take in account several factors like wickets taken , quality of pitch and opposition , match result etc .",
    "however , due to its opaqueness , icc s methodology is incomprehensible .",
    "our approach is both novel and transparent .",
    "for comparison , we choose the top @xmath74 bowlers according to icc rankings bowlers in odi and test . ] and compare them with in - strength rank and pagerank .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr3 ] shows that strong correlation exists between ranks obtained by network based tools and that provided by icc*. this demonstrates that our network based approach captures the consensus opinions .",
    "finally we propose a linear regression model for in - strength that takes into consideration known ranking schemes like pagerank , batting ( bowling ) average and icc ranking , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the in - strength , @xmath77 is the pagerank of a player @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath78 represents the batting ( bowling ) average of player @xmath38 and @xmath79 is a dummy variable which takes the value @xmath80 if a player is placed in the top @xmath81 of icc player ranking @xcite , and @xmath82 otherwise .",
    "as shown in table  [ table_regression_1 ] , we observe that for bowlers in test cricket ( @xmath0 ) , bowling average has no significant effect for in - strength , thus justifying the absence of correlation observed earlier in figure  [ fig : corr2](c , d ) .",
    "to summarize , we quantified the performance of batsmen and bowlers in the history of cricket by studying the network structure of cricket players . under the usual qualification of @xmath8 balls bowled , _",
    "george lohmann _ emerge as the best bowler .",
    "again , if we apply the qualification of at least @xmath83 dismissals , then _ c. s. marriott _ is the best bowler .",
    "these constraints are arbitrary and hence gauging bowler s potential according to bowling average is not robust .",
    "the advantage of network analysis is that it does nt introduce these ` constraints ' and yet provides consistent results .",
    "in such situation , in - strength and pagerank score stands out as an efficient measure of a bowler s ability .",
    "we would like to mention that although our study includes the quality of bowling attack or quality of dismissal of a batsman , we do nt consider the fielding abilities or wicket - keeping abilities of the fielders .",
    "it is not possible to quantify the fielding ability of a fielder , other than by the number of catches , which is not a true measure of a fielder s ability .",
    "some fielders are more athletic than others .",
    "slip fielders always have a higher chance of taking a catch than others .",
    "again , a batsman deserves more credit if he is able to beat athletic fielders like jonty rhodes , ricky ponting or yuvraj singh .",
    "secondly , a bowler s ability is also judged by the nature of wicket . an excellent bowling performance on",
    "a batsman - friendly pitch holds greater merit than that on pitches which help bowlers .",
    "similarly , scoring runs on difficult tracks always gets more attention than scoring runs on good batting tracks . in our analysis ,",
    "due to non - availability of these informations , we did nt include these ` external factors ' in our analysis .",
    "nevertheless a network based approach could address the issue of relative performance of one player against other .",
    "our study shows that sna can indeed classify bowlers and batsmen based on the quality of wickets taken or runs scored and not on the averages alone .",
    "team selection is extremely important for any nation .",
    "sna could be used as an objective way to aid the selection committee .",
    "a proper analysis of a player s domestic performance would help his(her ) selection in the national squad .",
    "additionally , owners of the cash rich indian premier league ( ipl ) teams spend lots of money to hire players on a contract basis .",
    "the owners along with the coaches can identify talents based on the past ` performance ' of a player .",
    "potentially our study could identify the greatest batsman of all time , based on a complete player - vs - player information , which at present we are unable to identify due to non - availability of data .",
    "our analysis does nt aim at replacing the existing system of icc player ranking , which are based on expert opinions and has been optimized and almost perfected for many years .",
    "it serves as an alternate method to refine the existing ranking scheme of players and quantify the performance of a player .",
    "there are many additional features that could be included in the networks .",
    "for example , the networks in our analysis are static",
    ". a dynamic version of the network can be constructed following the ball - by - ball commentary and obtain a detailed analysis .",
    "again , for batsmen there are players who score differently in different innings .",
    "there are leadership effects as well .",
    "some players perform well under different skippers .",
    "bowlers are categorized into different categories based on their bowling style - pacers , medium pacers and spinners .",
    "quantifying the ` style ' of bowling and effect of pitch conditions thus remains an open area of research . a rigorous analysis backed by a complete dataset of player - vs - player",
    "could very well answer the question - was _ sir don bradman _ the greatest ever ? in our quest to judge the most successful bowler in the history of cricket , one fact stands out : _",
