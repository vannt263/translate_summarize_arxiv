    "the purpose of the present work is the analysis of paramagnetic effects of magnetic field ( zeeman term ) on metastability in the zero - bandwidth limit of the extended hubbard model with pair hopping interaction @xcite ( i.e. the limit of the so - called penson - kolb - hubbard ( pkh ) model ) .",
    "the pkh model is one of the conceptually simplest effective models for studying superconductivity of the narrow band systems with short - range , almost unretarded pairing @xcite .",
    "the model includes a nonlocal pairing mechanism that is distinct from on - site interaction in the attractive hubbard model and that is the driving force of pair formation and also of their condensation .",
    "because of the complexity of the pkh model there are no exact solutions for that model . in this paper",
    "we present the exact results for the pkh model with .",
    "we extend our investigations of the model to the case of finite external magnetic field @xmath0 and concentrate on metastable phases and phase separations in the case of .",
    "our starting point is the model with the hamiltonian given by @xmath6 where , , , and @xmath7 is @xmath8-component of the total spin at @xmath9 site . @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an electron with spin at the site @xmath9 , which satisfy standard fermion anticommutation relations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the kronecker delta .",
    "@xmath3 is the on - site density interaction , @xmath4 is the intersite charge exchange interaction ( pair hopping ) between nearest neighbours , @xmath14 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath1 is the chemical potential , determining the concentration of electrons by the formula : @xmath15 with .",

    "indicates the sum over nearest - neighbour sites @xmath9 and @xmath19 independently .",
    "we also introduce , where @xmath8 is a  number of the nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "it is important to mention that model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) on the alternate lattices exhibits two symmetries .",
    "the first one is a symmetry between ( @xmath20-pairing , ss , @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22-pairing , @xmath22s , , @xmath23 is half of the smallest reciprocal lattice vector ) cases in the absence of the field conjugated with the ss order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "thus in the following we restrict our analysis to the case only .",
    "notice that in the presence of finite single electron hopping the symmetry is broken in the general case @xcite .",
    "the second one is the particle - hole symmetry @xcite , thus the phase diagrams obtained are symmetric with respect to half - filling and they will be presented only in the range and .    model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) has been intensively investigated for @xcite as well as for @xcite ( in particular , in the context of the phase separation @xcite ( for , ) and metastable phases @xcite ( for ) ) .",
    "the analysis has been performed within a variational approach ( va ) , which treats the @xmath3 term exactly and the intersite @xmath4 interaction within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) ( which is a  rigorous treatment of the @xmath4 term in the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite ) . as a  result for the thermodynamic limit ,",

    "the free energy of the ps state is derived in a  standard way , using maxwell s construction ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to find homogeneous solutions for all local minima ( even very low ones ) with respect to @xmath27 of grand canonical potential @xmath28 ( or free energy @xmath29 ) if system is considered for fixed @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "the solution ( of the set of two self - consistent equations for @xmath2 and @xmath24 ) is related to a  metastable phase if it corresponds to a  ( local ) minimum of @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) with respect to @xmath27 and the stability condition ( system with fixed @xmath2 ) is fulfilled .",
    "otherwise , the phase is unstable .",
    "a  stable ( homogeneous ) phase is a  metastable phase with the lowest free energy ( among all metastable phases and phase separated states ) .",
