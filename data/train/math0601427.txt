    "the study of global existence / finite - time blow - up of the two - dimensional quasi - geostrophic ( subsequently referred to as 2d qg for simplicity ) equation has been an active research area in the past ten years , partly due to its close connection to the 3d incompressible euler equations ( constantin - majda - tabak @xcite , cordoba @xcite , cordoba - fefferman @xcite ) .",
    "the 2d qg equation has its origin in modeling rotating fluids on the earth surface ( pedlosky @xcite ) .",
    "the equation describes the transportation of a scalar quantity @xmath0 : @xmath2 with initial conditions @xmath3 .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and the velocity @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath9 .    as pointed out by constantin - majda - tabak @xcite , the 2d qg equation bears striking mathematical and physical analogy to the 3d incompressible euler equations .",
    "they both exhibit similar geometric / analytic structures .",
    "in particular , one can derive a necessary and sufficient blow - up condition for the 2d qg equation similar to the well - known beale - kato - majda criterion ( beale - kato - majda @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the solution to the 2d qg equation ( [ eq : qg ] ) becomes singular at time @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 thus , @xmath12 plays a role similar to the vorticity @xmath13 in the 3d euler equations .",
    "furthermore , as in the 3d incompressible euler equations , the velocity @xmath4 is related to @xmath14 by an order @xmath15 singular integral operator .",
    "on the other hand , in some aspects the 2d qg equation behaves much better than the 3d incompressible euler equations .",
    "for example , it was shown in cordoba @xcite that @xmath16 is bounded by @xmath17 for any time @xmath18 , while for the 3d incompressible euler equations , @xmath16 may grow as fast as @xmath19 according to kelvin s circulation theorem .",
    "much effort has been made to obtain global existence for the 2d qg equation . in constantin - majda - tabak @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if the direction field @xmath20 remains smooth in a region , then no finite - time singularity is possible in that region .",
    "in particular , if this region contains maximum @xmath1 all the time , then the solution remains regular global in time .",
    "based on this understanding , they conjectured that the 2d qg equation with initial level sets of the hyperbolic saddle type is likely to develop a finite time singularity .",
    "they further presented some numerical evidence which supports a finite time singularity for the 2d qg equation .",
    "later on , ohkitani - yamada @xcite , constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite re - did the numerical simulations with higher resolutions , and revealed that the growth of @xmath21 in time is no faster than double exponential . around the same time , cordoba @xcite proved that the growth of @xmath22 in the hyperbolic saddle scenario is bounded by quadruple exponential under the assumption that near the saddle point the level sets of @xmath0 exhibits certain self - similar structure .",
    "this result was subsequently simpified by cordoba - fefferman in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take a different approach first proposed by deng - hou - yu @xcite to study the singularity problem of the 3d euler equations . following the similar approach for the 2d qg equation",
    ", we study the lagrangian evolution of some localized segments of level sets carrying large @xmath23 . by exploring the incompressibility condition of @xmath24 and using the local geometric properties of level sets , we obtain estimates for the growth of @xmath1 by studying the stretching of such level set segments .",
    "we find that , when there is one level set segment of length @xmath25 on which the maximum @xmath26 is comparable to the global maximum , and along which @xmath27 is bounded by @xmath28 , the growth rate of @xmath21 is bounded by triple exponential . in particular , when the length of the segment and the bound of @xmath29 are both @xmath30 , we can improve our estimate on the growth of @xmath22 and bound it by double exponential . the double exponential estimate is sharp according to recent numerical simulations ( ohkitani - yamada @xcite , constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite ) .    we also perform careful numerical experiments to study the local geometric properties of the level sets in a region containing maximum @xmath31 .",
    "our numerical results indicate that this region of large @xmath31 and the region of large @xmath32 are essentially disjoint .",
    "furthermore , there exists an @xmath30 level set segment within this region of large @xmath31 along which @xmath27 is bounded .",
    "thus our second theorem applies , which implies that @xmath33 is bounded by double exponential in time . in some sense ,",
    "our theoretical results capture the essential feature of the dynamic growth of the 2d qg equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : main - results ] we give an overview of the main results . in section [ sec : numerical ] we present numerical results which illustrate the local geometric properties of the level sets in the region containing maximum @xmath31",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : key - est ] we estimate level set stretching and obtain an estimate for the growth of @xmath1 , and prove the main theorems .",
    "we present the main results in this section . denoting @xmath34 by @xmath35 , we consider , at time @xmath18 , a level set segment @xmath36 along which the maximum of @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath37 in the following ) is comparable to @xmath38 . denote by @xmath39 the arc length of @xmath36 , @xmath40 the tangential , and @xmath41 the normal unit vector of @xmath36 .",
    "the direction of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined as follows : @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we define @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ( unsigned ) curvature .",
    "we should point out that our theorems only requires @xmath36 to be a subset of @xmath49 , the flow image of @xmath50 at time @xmath18 , for @xmath51 . with these notations , we present our main results .",
    "[ thm : triple]assume that there is a family of level set segments @xmath36 and @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "also assume that @xmath38 is monotonically increasing and @xmath55 for some @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "then the classical solution of the 2d qg equation can be extended beyond @xmath10 as long as the following conditions are satisfied : there exists constants @xmath58 , such that    * ( h1 ) . @xmath59 , and * ( h2 ) .",
    "@xmath60 .    furthermore , for @xmath61",
    ", we have the following triple exponential estimate : @xmath62 for some constants @xmath63 independent of @xmath18 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath64 for some @xmath65 , we can easily prove non - blowup of the solution with condition ( h1 ) replaced by @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "see yu @xcite for details .    with stronger assumptions on the regularity of @xmath68 , we can obtain a sharper growth estimate , which yields double exponential growth of @xmath38 .",
    "this growth rate is consistent with the observations in recent numerical simulations ( ohkitani - yamada @xcite , constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm : double]assume that all the assumptions and conditions in theorem [ thm : triple ] hold , except that ( h1 ) is replaced by    * ( h1 ) .",
    ".    then the estimate ( [ eq : triple.est ] ) can be improved to @xmath70 for some constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 independent of time .    in section [ sec : numerical ] , we will perform numerical experiments to study the local geometric properties of the level sets . in particular",
    ", we will show that the conditions ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) are consistent with our numerical results .",
    "furthermore , for certain hyperbolic saddle scenario similar to the one studied by cordoba in @xcite but with additional assumptions , we can prove that the conditions ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) are actually satisfied .",
    "this gives a partial theoretical justification of the conditions ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) in certain hyperbolic saddle scenario .",
    "the key observation is that the maximum @xmath1 along any level set is located away from the saddle point .",
    "therefore although @xmath73 is large near the saddle point , it is bounded along level set segments considered in theorem [ thm : double ] . for details , see yu @xcite .",
    "to further understand the dynamics of the 2d qg system ( [ eq : qg])([eq : qg.psi ] ) and to study the local geometric properties of the level sets , we perform careful numerical simulations of the 2d qg equation . specifically , we would like to track the dynamic evolution of the following two regions which characterize the geometric regularity of the level sets around the points of maximum @xmath1 :    the region of large @xmath1 , and    the region of large @xmath74 .    as we will demonstrate from our numerical simulations ,",
    "these two regions are essentially disjoint .",
    "although they both undergo severe stretching and thining as the flow evolves , their intersection occupies just a small portion of either one of these two regions .",
    "this numerical result is quite surprising .",
    "it shows that in the very localized region where the maximum of @xmath1 is attained , the level sets across this region are regular . on the other hand , in the region where @xmath74 is very large , the value of @xmath1 is relatively small compared with its global maximum .",
    "this complementary local geometric regularity of level set filaments seems to be the key in the dynamic depletion of the vortex stretching for the 2d qg equation . due to this local geometric regularity of level sets , theorem [ thm : double ]",
    "can be applied to the 2d qg flow , which explains the double exponential growth of @xmath1 observed in recent numerical simulations .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed using the pseudo - spectral method with the @xmath75 de - aliasing rule in space , and the 4th order classical runge - kutta in time .",
    "we use up to @xmath76 space resolution to resolve the rapidly increasing gradient of @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the time step is determined by the cfl condition . to make the time marching more stable",
    ", we use @xmath77 of the maximum allowed cfl number .",
    "the computation is done on a 4-cpu ( intel(r ) xeon 3.00 ghz ) machine with 2048 kb cache and 6 g memory .",
    "the fft code is from fftw 3.1 .",
    "we use the same initial condition used by constantin - majda - tabak @xcite , ohkitani - yamada @xcite , constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite which contains hyperbolic saddles : @xmath78 in constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , other initial conditions were also considered .",
    "it was found that the solutions corresponding to these initial conditions behave essentially the same as the one described above .",
    "therefore we decide to focus on the above initial condition ( [ eq : theta.0 ] ) and try to resolve the hyperbolic saddle and the fine structure of the direction field of @xmath14 .",
    "we plot the maximum @xmath1 versus time in figure [ fig : loglog ] , which is almost identical to fig . 2 in ohkitani - yamada @xcite .",
    "we also compare the level set contours obtained by our computations with those obtained in constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "next we study the evolution of the two regions mentioned above .",
    "we plot , at times @xmath79and @xmath80 the boundaries of the following two regions :    @xmath81 , and    @xmath82 .    in figures [ fig : abt=5.0 ] , [ fig : abt=6.0 ] , [ fig : abt=6.5 ] , [ fig : abt=7.0 ] , we see that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are essentially disjoint , although some interlacing of the boundaries can be observed .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 ( consequently @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) is bounded in the region where @xmath1 achieves its maximum .",
    "this is an interesting result by itself .",
    "it says that the local geometric property of the level sets is regular in the region of maximum stretching .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from figures [ fig : at=5.0 ] , [ fig : at=6.0 ] , [ fig : at=6.5 ] , [ fig : at=7.0 ] that although @xmath83 is severely stretched as time increases , the stretching seems to align with the level set curves . as a result",
    ", we can always pick a level set segment of @xmath30 length , along which the maximum @xmath87 is comparable to its global maximum .",
    "thus , the conditions of theorem [ thm : double ] are satisfied , and we can apply theorem [ thm : double ] to conclude that the maximum growth rate of @xmath1 is bounded by double exponential , which is consistent with recent numerical simulations ( ohkitani - yamada @xcite , constantin - nie - schorghofer @xcite , @xcite ) .",
