    "<S> supersymmetry and anomaly cancellation place strong constraints on quantum theories of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> such constraints are strongest in higher dimensions . in eleven dimensions </S>",
    "<S> there is a unique theory of gravity compatible with supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this theory is believed to be described as a uv - complete quantum theory by the branch of string theory known as `` m - theory '' . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in ten dimensions with two supersymmetries ( @xmath5 ) , there are only two consistent supergravity theories , known as type iia and iib . both of these are realized as limits of string theory . in these highly supersymmetric situations , </S>",
    "<S> then , we have `` string universality , '' meaning that all theories without known inconsistencies are realized in string theory .    as the dimension and number of supersymmetries decreases , the range of possible theories dramatically increases . </S>",
    "<S> in four space - time dimensions with one or no supersymmetries , we have only a limited understanding of the range of possible string compactifications , but our knowledge of consistency conditions needed for uv completion is still weaker ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the term `` swampland '' has been used to characterize the set of theories which can not be ruled out from knowledge of the low - energy physics , and yet which can not be realized in string theory @xcite . given our limited knowledge of both the space of string compactifications and constraints on consistent quantum gravity theories , the apparent swampland is a moving target , decreasing in scope whenever new string vacuum constructions or quantum consistency constraints are identified . </S>",
    "<S> although the space of four dimensional theories has been so far hard to characterize globally , it was conjectured in @xcite that @xmath0 supergravity theories in six dimensions satisfy string universality . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , some theories in this class which still lie in the apparent swampland , neither provably inconsistent nor as - yet realized in string theory @xcite , so this conjecture remains to be conclusively proven or disproven .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present work , we reconsider the simplest and most symmetric class of supergravity theories where string universality is in doubt , namely @xmath6 supergravity in ten dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry allows the addition of yang - mills fields in such theories , and cancellation of gravitational and gauge anomalies @xcite requires the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only consistent choices of the gauge group @xmath7 without abelian factors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are realized as the type i and heterotic limits of string theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted that the gauge groups @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy some of the same conditions as the @xmath12 and @xmath13 cases @xcite , and therefore might appear to be consistent , anomaly - free theories . </S>",
    "<S> they are thus candidates for the swampland , since they have no known embedding into string theory . in @xcite fiol noted several properties of these theories , related to their moduli spaces and singularities under compactification , suggesting they can not be embedded into a theory of quantum gravity .     </S>",
    "<S> supergravity theories in ten dimensions with abelian factors . with no corresponding anomaly to cancel , these theories are not gauge invariant ]    in this note , we demonstrate that these theories with abelian gauge group factors indeed can not be consistent supersymmetric quantum theories of gravity . in brief , although the anomaly factorizes as needed for the green - schwarz mechanism , the abelian gauge fields do not participate in hexagon diagrams , so there are no abelian anomalies to cancel . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry , however , requires a coupling of the @xmath14 field to the abelian gauge bosons of the form @xmath15 , just as in the non - abelian case . in using the @xmath14 field to cancel the gravitational and non - abelian gauge anomalies , the standard green - schwarz mechanism generates tree diagrams with external abelian gauge bosons of the form in figure  [ f : diagram ] with no associated anomaly </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a breakdown of gauge invariance for theories with abelian factors . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ten dimensional supergravity theories appear to manifest string universality  all consistent theories have string theory embeddings , and the 10d supergravity swampland is empty .    * anomaly cancellation in non - abelian theories *    we begin by reviewing green - schwarz anomaly cancellation for the purely non - abelian theories . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic fields of ten - dimensional @xmath6 supergravity plus super - yang - mills consist of a metric @xmath16 , the dilaton @xmath17 , a 2-form @xmath18 and the gauge field @xmath19 with @xmath20 the generators of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> the action for these fields can be written as @xmath21 with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this theory also includes three fermions , a gravitino @xmath23 , a dilatino @xmath24 , and a gaugino @xmath25 , whose contributions to the action we suppress . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown by bergshoeff et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the case of an abelian gauge group , and extended to the non - abelian case by chapline and manton @xcite , that supersymmetry requires the field strength of the 2-form to acquire an extra piece consisting of the chern - simons term for the gauge group , @xmath26 where @xmath27 as a result , invariance under the gauge group is only maintained if @xmath14 transforms nontrivially under this group as well . if @xmath28 \\ , , \\quad \\quad b_2 \\to b_2 + { \\rm tr}(\\lambda f ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 an algebra - valued 0-form , then @xmath30 is gauge invariant .    as is well - known , possible gauge groups for this theory </S>",
    "<S> are highly constrained by anomaly cancellation . for theories in ten dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is conveniently expressed in terms of a formal twelve - form anomaly polynomial @xmath31 , constructed out of the gauge and tangent bundle curvature 2-forms . </S>",
    "<S> this obeys the descent relations , @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the combined gauge and local lorentz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of the path integral to be gauge invariant is then given by the integral of @xmath34 , @xmath35 the fermions are all majorana - weyl fields , and thus being chiral they contribute to both gauge anomalies ( the gaugino ) and gravitational anomalies ( gaugino , dilatino and gravitino ) . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions come from hexagon diagrams with six external gauge bosons and/or gravitons coupled to the various fermi fields running in a loop . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to the anomaly polynomial from the fermions for a general non - abelian gauge group were computed by alvarez - gaum and witten @xcite , and , following the presentation of polchinski @xcite , can be arranged to the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the trace in the adjoint representation of the gauge group ( supersymmetry requires that the gauginos running in the loop transform in the adjoint ) , @xmath38 is the trace in the fundamental of @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the total number of gauge bosons and @xmath41 the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism is possible when the first two terms in ( [ anompoly ] ) vanish , so that the anomaly takes the factorized form of the final term . for gauge groups </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the term inside large parentheses in ( [ anompoly ] ) vanishes due to particular identities of those groups , and @xmath42 for both , killing the middle term .    for the remaining @xmath43 term to be cancelled through the green - schwarz mechanism , the three - form field strength must be enhanced at higher orders in the derivative expansion by a chern - simons term in the spin connection , @xmath44 and the action must include at higher order the green - schwarz term , @xmath45 to preserve local lorentz invariance the two - form @xmath18 must now transform as @xmath46 due to this modified transformation , the green - schwarz term is not gauge invariant ; instead , because @xmath47 we have from the descent relations that the gauge variation of ( [ gsterm ] ) is exactly of the correct form to cancel the anomaly in ( [ eq : i-10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> diagramatically , a tree diagram with a @xmath14 propagator connecting @xmath48 and @xmath49 vertices is generated by the cross - terms in @xmath50 induced by ( [ bothcs ] ) and the green - schwarz term , cancelling the anomaly from the hexagon diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the first equation in ( [ ydescent ] ) is equivalent to @xmath51 this coincidence between the factorized anomaly polynomial ( [ anompoly ] ) and the modified field strength required by supersymmetry ( [ bothcs ] ) is the essential relation that allows the green - schwarz mechanism to operate .    </S>",
    "<S> through this mechanism , the non - abelian @xmath12 and @xmath13 supergravities can be free of quantum anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since these supergravities are the low - energy limit of the type i and heterotic string theories , where the higher - derivative terms in ( [ bothcs ] ) and ( [ gsterm ] ) arise automatically , these theories seem to be consistent quantum theories in the uv .    </S>",
    "<S> * 10d supergravity with abelian gauge group factors *    we now turn to the primary focus of this note , the theories with gauge groups @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these theories both contain @xmath52 generators , and the term in large parentheses in ( [ anompoly ] ) vanishes for both , so they again have anomaly polynomials which take the factorized form @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naively it then appears that the green - schwarz mechanism can again be brought to bear . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the issue is that the green - schwarz term needed to cancel gravitational anomalies is required by supersymmetry to have a non - trivial abelian gauge variation , but there is no abelian anomaly to cancel this variation .    to see this , </S>",
    "<S> recall that the @xmath53-dependent terms in the anomaly polynomial ( [ anompoly ] ) were generated by loops of gauginos coupling to external gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> since , however , the general coupling between a gaugino and the gauge fields is @xmath54 a @xmath55 gauge field , for which all associated structure constants vanish , decouples from the gauginos and does not appear in hexagon diagrams at all . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the anomaly polynomial should be independent of all abelian field strengths .    </S>",
    "<S> this is in fact already encoded in ( [ anompoly ] ) , since @xmath37 is the trace in the adjoint , and the adjoint of @xmath55 is the singlet , so these traces vanish . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this is why the term in parentheses vanishes for these theories ; for @xmath1 it is simply zero term by term , and for @xmath2 all the abelian generators drop out analogously , while @xmath56 alone obeys the same relation used in the @xmath13 case . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in these cases lose all the traces over the @xmath55 generators . for @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly simple , @xmath59 while for @xmath11 they take the form ( [ yandx ] ) but with @xmath56 field strengths only . </S>",
    "<S> the only anomalies that must be cancelled , then , are gravitational and non - abelian gauge anomalies .    as shown by bergshoeff et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , supersymmetry requires that each abelian factor @xmath60 contributes an abelian chern - simons contribution to @xmath30 of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 indicates gravitational and possible non - abelian chern - simons contributions . as a result , the kinetic term for @xmath64 is only gauge - invariant if @xmath64 transforms under a general abelian gauge transformation as @xmath65 to cancel the gravitational and possible non - abelian anomalies , we need a green - schwarz term of the usual form ( [ gsterm ] ) . the green - schwarz term is not invariant under the abelian factors in the gauge group , however , transforming as @xmath66 since there is no abelian anomaly to cancel this gauge variation , the abelian symmetries are explicitly violated . alternately , preserving gauge invariance under the abelian factors forbids this green - schwarz term , whose absence would leave an uncancelled local lorentz anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry thus allows us to preserve either abelian gauge or local lorentz invariance , but not both .    </S>",
    "<S> the inapplicability of the green - schwarz mechanism in these cases can be viewed as the failure of the abelian theories to satisfy ( [ yandh ] ) , @xmath67 the abelian fields decouple from hexagon diagrams and hence drop out of @xmath57 , but are kept in @xmath68 by the demands of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to tree - level contributions of the form @xmath69 to the anomaly polynomial which do not correspond to any one - loop anomalies ; correspondingly , the descent relations no longer imply that the variation of @xmath18 can cancel the complete anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ten - dimensional @xmath70 @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories can not be made anomaly - free by the green - schwarz mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus shown that there are no consistent supergravity theories in ten dimensions that can not be obtained from string theory . </S>"
