    "argon is expected to be an excellent target for direct dark matter detection experiments searching for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite .",
    "however , natural argon collected from the atmosphere contains @xmath0ar and @xmath3ar that are radioactive isotopes .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar is measured to be 8.1@xmath410@xmath5g / g  @xcite for atmospheric argon .",
    "such a concentration results in 1 bq / kg of specific activity of @xmath0ar ( @xmath6 kev , t@xmath7= 269 y  @xcite )",
    ". existing experimental limits on the @xmath3ar concentration in the atmosphere are less than 10@xmath8 @xmath3ar atoms per @xmath1ar atom  @xcite , which makes about 0.018 hz / kg of specific activity of @xmath3ar ( @xmath9 kev and t@xmath7 = 33 y ) .",
    "the production of @xmath0ar in the atmosphere is dominated by the @xmath1ar(n , 2n ) process  @xcite with a reaction threshold of 1011.86 kev .",
    "@xmath3ar is produced in the atmosphere through @xmath1ar + n @xmath10 @xmath11ar and @xmath11ar+n @xmath10@xmath3ar .",
    "the neutrons in the above reactions are from cosmic rays .",
    "recently developed argon - based dark matter detectors measure scintillation light induced by low - energy nuclear recoils due to elastic scattering of wimps .",
    "argon has two distinct mechanisms for the emission of scintillation light : prompt light ( 6 ns ) and delayed light ( 1.5 @xmath12s )  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the prompt light to total light has been demonstrated experimentally to be well separated between electronic recoils and nuclear recoils  @xcite .",
    "this property allows these two types of events to be distinguished on an event by event basis .",
    "the discrimination power is proved to be up to @xmath13 electronic recoils versus one nuclear recoil  @xcite at 20 kev electron - equivalent ( ee ) energy .",
    "such a high pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) power makes argon a very attractive dark matter target for the planned dark matter program at dusel .",
    "however , the existence of @xmath0ar and @xmath3ar potentially limits the detection sensitivity of next generation dusel dark matter experiments with multi - ton target masses .",
    "for instance , argon extracted from air results in @xmath0ar beta - decay at a level of 1 hz / kg  @xcite ; a 5-ton detector would give a trigger rate of 5000 hz and a total of 3.2 @xmath410@xmath14 events / year in the energy range of interest ( 20 kevee to 60 kevee ) ; this requires psd to be 3.2 @xmath410@xmath14 in order to achieve a sensitivity of 3 @xmath4 10@xmath15 @xmath16 at 20 kevee threshold .",
    "such a high psd has not been yet demonstrated experimentally .",
    "moreover , without depletion of @xmath0ar , it is unlikely that the data acquisition dead time would be manageable for a multi - ton detector and a large scale computing facility would be required to perform on - line data reduction for a large amount of data from @xmath0ar decays even for a single - phase detector .",
    "in addition , a dual - phase detector that drifts electrons from the liquid to gaseous would encounter serious difficulties with pile - up events because of the milliseconds drift time required . with depletion of @xmath0ar by a large factor we can not only reduce background data , but also make it possible to lower the energy threshold to access a larger parameter space of wimps .",
    "therefore , a multi - ton argon - based dark matter detector is promising only if natural argon is depleted of @xmath0ar .",
    "a large amount of argon depleted in @xmath0ar and @xmath3ar would be of great benefit to the dusel dark matter program described above . because @xmath0ar and @xmath3ar are produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere",
    ", it is logical to consider that underground sources of argon should be depleted in @xmath0ar and @xmath3ar due to the suppression of cosmic rays flux by the overburden .",
    "there are two sources of underground argon : 1 ) argon in natural gas and 2 ) argon dissolved in underground water .",
    "the former from natural gas wells in the us national helium reserve was found to contain a low level of @xmath0ar  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar ( stable isotope ) was found to be @xmath17 4@xmath410@xmath18 at a confidence level of 84%  @xcite .",
    "the latter from underground water 3200 feet below the surface at wall , south dakota is the focus of this paper .",
    "understanding the production of various argon isotopes underground by stopping negative muon captures and neutron interactions is critical to the dating method with @xmath0ar . in this study , we realize for the first time that the @xmath0ar production via stopping negative muon capture on @xmath0k is a dominant processes when the depth of underground resources is smaller than 1800 m.w.e .",
    "the early work of references  @xcite showed the @xmath0ar production only through ( n , p ) reaction on @xmath0k .",
    "neutrons can be produced by : 1 ) cosmic - rays depending on the rock composition and depth of the site  @xcite ; and 2 ) ( @xmath19 neutrons depending on the rock composition and radioactivity level in the rock .",
    "the neutron fluxes and energy spectra are essential to the calculation of various isotopes of argon and hence the reliability of dating results . in this paper",
    ", we describe the production mechanisms underground for argon content in section  [ sec : prod ] .",
    "the measured rock composition and potassium content in a site as a potential argon source is discussed in section  [ sec : rock ] .",
    "we show the production rate of @xmath0ar and @xmath1ar in section  [ sec : cal ] . finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "underground production of @xmath0ar isotopes occurs primarily through stopping negative muon captures and ( @xmath20 ) reactions on @xmath0k and @xmath1ca targets .",
    "both elements are in a range of a few percent depending on the chemical composition of the rock .",
    "neutrons are produced by three sources : 1 ) ( @xmath21,n ) reactions induced by @xmath22u and @xmath23th decay chains ; 2 ) fission decays induced by @xmath22u and @xmath23th ; and 3 ) muon - induced neutrons .",
    "the production of @xmath0ar through stopping negative muon captures and muon - induced neutrons depends strongly on the depth of the rock overburden .",
    "this results in a depth dependent production of @xmath0ar induced by stopping negative muons and muon - induced neutrons .",
    "when negatively charged muons are stopped in the rock , they either decay through @xmath24 or are captured through @xmath25 .",
    "the capture cross section can be estimated using the formula @xmath26 where a is atomic mass number of the isotope , @xmath27 mol@xmath28 is avogadro s constant , @xmath29 is the speed of the stopping negative muons in the medium , @xmath30 is the stopping negative muon capture time in the medium , and @xmath31 is the density of the medium .",
    "the lifetime of stopping negative muons in potassium is 410 ns  @xcite .",
    "the capture time can be calculated based on @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( 410 _ ns _ ) is the measured lifetime of muons in potassium and @xmath34 ( 2200 _ ns _ ) is the lifetime of muons in vacuum .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cross ] ) and ( [ eq : capt ] ) , we obtain the cross section of the stopping negative muon capture on potassium as a function of the stopping muon energy .",

    "note that the neutron absorption here means that the neutron is absorbed and no further neutron is ejected , thus the absorption cross section includes contributions from all reaction channels which do not eject neutrons .",

    "also shown in the figure is the cross section of @xmath3ca(n,@xmath49 reaction , which can in principle contribute to @xmath0ar production . however , its contribution is negligible because of relatively small cross section and @xmath3ca concentration compared to @xmath0k .",

    "the half - life @xmath57 of @xmath1k is @xmath58 years .",
    "[ fig : ar40 ] shows the number of @xmath1ar atoms produced as a function of the rock age .",

    "because the production rate is much smaller than the existing @xmath1k in the rock , we ignore this process in our calculation of the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar .",

    "if we assume that @xmath0ar and @xmath1ar have the same possibility to diffuse out of the grains of the rock and to be dissolved in the pore water , then the @xmath0ar/@xmath1ar ratio in water can be obtained by applying eq .",

    "thus , a depletion factor of 1.6 to 155 can be achieved for the argon extracted from this site when p varies from 0.01 to 1.0 .",
    "considering saturation solubility decreases when temperature increases , the dissolved possibility of @xmath0ar and @xmath1ar can be as small as 1% for the argon content produced in the underground environment where the temperature is higher .",
    "this would make underground water reservoir a valuable source for depleted argon that can be used for ton - scale dark matter experiments . if one assumes that 30%  @xcite of ar produced will be dissolved in water , the ratio between @xmath0ar and @xmath1ar in water is @xmath72 , which is a factor of @xmath625 lower than that in atmosphere .",

    "we demonstrate that argon depleted in @xmath0 can be obtained only if the depth of the underground resources is greater than 500 m.w.e . below the surface . stopping negative muon capture on @xmath0k",
    "dominates over radiogenic production at depths of less than 2000 m.w.e . , and that production by muon - induced neutrons is subdominant at any depth .",
    "depending on the rock porosity and argon diffusion coefficient , the upper limit of the concentration of @xmath0ar in the underground water at wall of south dakota is estimated to be in a range of a factor of 1.6 to 155 less than the @xmath0ar concentration in the atmosphere . naturally occurring @xmath1k ec decay dominates the content of @xmath1ar underground .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar depends largely on the following : 1 ) the potassium content in the rock ; 2 ) the natural radioactivity of @xmath23th and @xmath22u in the rock ; 3 ) the rock porosity ; 4 ) argon gas diffusion coefficient underground ; and 5 ) argon gas solubility in the water underground .",
    "we estimate that the production of @xmath3ar is negligible at this underground site .",
    "the calculation tools presented in this paper are also critical to the dating method with @xmath0ar  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar varies from location to location depending on the @xmath0k content and the radioactivity level in the rock at large depth .",
    "extraction of argon gas from underground sources must : 1 ) evaluate the depth of the site , the age of the rock , the rock composition , and radioactivity ; 2 ) study the porosity of the rock and argon gas diffusion coefficient ; and 3 ) understand the solubility of argon gas as a function of pressure and temperature . the algorithm described in this paper is critical to understanding the discrepancy in the dating methods with the ratio of @xmath0ar to @xmath1ar  @xcite .",
