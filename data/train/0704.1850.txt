    "the behavior of matter subjected to extreme conditions through dynamic loading is of interest from a direct physical standpoint , as dynamic loading is often the only practical way to induce extreme conditions , and because important engineering problems in hypervelocity impact and weaponry involve dynamic loading @xcite .",
    "temperature is a key parameter in understanding the properties of matter , as it governs the population of vibrational processes and excitations past energy barriers .",
    "temperature is thus important for a physical understanding of many types of behavior and the associated models .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) includes contributions from the excitation of atomic vibrations and electronic excitations .",
    "plastic flow is mediated by the excitation of dislocations and twin boundaries past peierls barriers .",
    "phase changes depend on the thermodynamic state s location in the phase diagram .",
    "the kinetics of phase changes are described by the nucleation and growth of the daughter phase in the matrix of the parent phase , requiring the excitation of atoms past barriers .",
    "chemical reactions are governed by the excitation of atoms or electrons over barriers . diffusion in condensed matter is the motion of atoms past the barriers formed by their neighbors .",
    "conductivities include scattering contributions from thermal excitations .",
    "temperature is notoriously difficult to measure during dynamic loading , in particular for opaque materials @xcite .",
    "extreme states of matter are often hidden within a sheath of matter in a different state  this is the usual situation in shock loading experiments .",
    "probes made of matter generally disrupt the state of interest , e.g. by presenting an impedance mismatch to compression waves .",
    "much interesting physics in condensed matter occurs at compressions of a few tens of percent , where the heating may be in the range of a few hundred kelvin and the resulting thermal emissions are small .",
    "most temperature measurements of shock - loaded systems have been made using photon emission spectroscopy , commonly called pyrometry @xcite",
    ". however , many materials of interest ( e.g. metals ) are opaque in the relevant region of the spectrum : infra - red through visible for shocks up to the terapascal regime .",
    "emission from an opaque material comes from the surface , which can not be maintained at the pressure of the initial shock for long enough to allow useful emission spectra to be collected .",
    "a transparent window can be placed in contact with the sample to maintain an elevated pressure , but the mismatch in shock impedance must be taken into account , along with the effect of heat conduction .",
    "accurate temperature data have been obtained from transparent sample materials , where thermal radiation from the shocked state can escape from the sample @xcite .",
    "neutron resonance spectroscopy ( nrs ) has been investigated as a fundamentally different technique for measuring the temperature inside a dynamically - loaded specimen , which can be used on opaque materials @xcite .",
    "trial measurements of nrs temperatures were performed on shock - loaded mo , as a standard material for high pressure work ; the shock temperature was found to lie significantly above the temperature predicted using reasonable eos for mo @xcite .",
    "measurements were also made using pyrometry of the temperature of mo which was shocked and then released into a lif window or into vacuum ; these experiments also yielded temperatures which lay significantly above eos predictions @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the effect of plastic flow on the mo pyrometry experiments .",
    "plastic flow was neglected in previous comparisons of predictions with the temperature data .",
    "the contribution of plastic work to heating has been mentioned in studies of other metals @xcite but has not been quantified in detail or consistently .",
    "the contribution to the total internal energy from plastic heating has been estimated in order to extract the scalar eos from shock data @xcite , which involves a similar analysis of shock heating , though less general .",
    "polycrystalline materials , such as the mo for which the discrepancy in temperature measurements was reported , are heterogeneous in that they are composed of an aggregate of grains of different crystallographic orientation .",
    "the mo samples were machined from material which had been prepared by pressing from powder , so there was a population of voids and there were impurities concentrated along grain boundaries . on shock loading and subsequent release , different regions of the sample would thus respond differently , producing a variation in local temperature .",
    "given enough time , temperature variations disperse through thermal conduction , but this typically takes of order microseconds for grains tens of micrometers in size , which is long on the time scale of the experiments .",
    "we wish to compare pyrometry measurements of temperature in mo with predictions using continuum models , so the temperature of interest is the mean , bulk value .",
    "thermal radiation is described by the stefan - boltzmann relation , where the total power is proportional to the fourth power of temperature .",
    "pyrometry measurements are often more accurate at shorter wavelengths where the power varies with higher powers of temperature @xcite",
    ". thus unquantified temperature variations ( spatial or temporal , within the respective resolutions of the detectors ) lead to an overestimate of the mean temperature .",
    "spatial variation of brightness temperature has been observed in shock - loaded sn @xcite , which has a much lower flow stress than mo .",
    "pyrometry measurements from metals probe the surface temperature . the surface is prone to increased plastic work around surface features such as machining marks : when a rough surface in contact with material of lower impedance ( or vacuum , in the extreme case ) is shocked , flow may be exaggerated in pits and grooves . at sufficiently high shock pressures , localized jetting",
    "may occur .",
    "any such localized increase in plastic flow will produce a higher local temperature , which may appear as a higher mean temperature as discussed above .",
    "for experiments in which the sample is observed through a transparent window to maintain an elevated pressure , there may be additional radiation from compression of any gas or glue in the gap between the sample and the window , or from the shocked window material itself .",
    "these effects were considered and corrected for the mo data @xcite .",
    "after the shock passes from the sample into a window , the temperature of the shock state is generally different to that in the sample , so heat conduction can alter the temperature of the sample surface .    in multiple channel pyrometry measurements , thermal emission from the sample",
    "is recorded using a set of detectors responding to different ranges of photon wavelength . in the simplest case",
    ", a grey body spectrum can be fitted to the signals , and the mean emissivity and temperature deduced from the shape of the spectrum . in general , the emissivity of a material varies with state and wavelength , and also with surface roughness , which may change during dynamic loading .",
    "the emissivity may be measured directly , for example by ellipsometry .",
    "it is more common to assume that the multiple pyrometry channels over - sample the wavelength variation of the radiance and emissivity , at least over part of the spectrum , allowing both to be deduced .",
    "again , these effects were taken into account for the mo measurements @xcite .",
    "aside from gaps and glues between the sample and any window , it is common for components of the shocked target assembly to include sharp corners and low - density materials such as plastics , foams , and glues , as part of the engineering structure . as with glued windows , low density materials in general",
    "may be shock - loaded to a higher temperature than the sample .",
    "sharp internal corners , when shocked , may form jets with large amounts of plastic heating .",
    "thermal emission from any of these sources may be present as a background against which the emission from the sample must be distinguished .",
    "the net effect of the complications associated with pyrometry measurements on metals is that it is possible to over - estimate the temperature .",
    "shock compression involves the transit of a shock wave through each element of material . subsequently ,",
    "axial and lateral release and recompression waves reverberate through the sample until it ultimately comes to rest at zero pressure . in the simplest case , which many shock physics experiments are designed to achieve ,",
    "the shock is steady and planar and the initial release is planar : the material is compressed and released uniaxially . in general , the shock and release may be converging or diverging , but locally the compression and decompression induced is close to uniaxial",
    ". specifically , the strains are not not isotropic .",
    "if a crystalline solid is subjected to non - isotropic strains then shear stresses must be induced , leading to plastic flow if the flow stress is exceeded .    in continuum dynamics situations such as shock loading",
    ", simulations and analysis may be performed accurately by a scalar solution of the shock jump and isentropic expansion relations if the material is represented by an eos , i.e. if the effects of elasticity and plastic flow are ignored .",
    "it is common practice to use spatially - resolving numerical simulations if the material is to be represented with any greater complexity .",
    "however , simulations of shock waves are complicated by the need to ensure that the shock  discontinuous at the continuum level  is captured accurately without inducing numerical artifacts such as oscillations or excess heating .",
    "however , numerical methods have been developed to allow shock compression and ramp decompression to be simulated by a scalar solution for general material models including elasticity and plastic flow @xcite .",
    "these numerical solutions were used to interpret the temperature measurements on mo .",
    "spatially - resolved simulations were also performed for comparison with velocity history measurements .",
    "these simulations used a lagrangian representation of the shock experiments , integrated in time with a predictor - corrector numerical scheme employing artificial viscosity to stabilize the shock wave @xcite .",
    "the material models were identical with those used in the scalar solution .    the conservation equations for shock and release states in material dynamics are usually formulated in terms of compression and pressure .",
    "an order to take account of elastic - plastic effects , the equations were formulated in terms of the stress and strain tensors .",
    "thus the rankine - hugoniot equations @xcite for conservation across the shock were expressed in terms of the total stress normal to the shock , @xmath0 , rather than the pressure",
    "@xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is specific volume ( the reciprocal of the mass density @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is specific internal energy , @xmath6 is the speed of the shock wave with respect to the material , @xmath7 is the change in material speed normal to the shock wave ( i.e. , parallel to its direction of propagation ) , and subscript @xmath8 refers to the initial state .",
    "the specific internal energy was defined to _ exclude _",
    "elastic strain energy , so the energy equation above included only the volumetric and plastic strain contributions to the volume change . the relation for adiabatic compression and release was expressed similarly : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stress tensor , @xmath11 the deviatoric stress @xmath12 @xmath13 the velocity gradient tensor , and @xmath14 its trace . for uniaxial compression ,",
    "@xmath15 i.e. the product of the components in the direction normal to the wave , all others being zero . in the non - spatially - resolved calculations , the velocity gradient was simply the assumed or imposed strain rate",
    ".    the state of the material was expressed in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( allowing a mean pressure @xmath16 to be calculated from the eos ) , a deviatoric elastic strain tensor @xmath17 ( allowing the deviatoric stress contributions @xmath11 to be calculated ) , and a scalar equivalent plastic strain @xmath18 , used to calculate work hardening . as discussed elsewhere",
    "@xcite , a hyperelastic formulation using strain rather than a hypoelastic formulation using stress was preferred for consistency and accuracy in situations where shear strains are applied at different compressions .",
    "thus the stress deviator @xmath11 was calculated from the instantaneous strain , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the shear modulus .",
    "plastic flow was taken to occur using a von mises yield surface @xcite .",
    "deformation was plastic rather than elastic if the scalar effective shear stress @xmath21 exceeded the yield stress @xmath22 , in which case plastic strain for work hardening was accumulated at a rate @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the deviatoric part of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient , @xmath25 if @xmath26 , the elastic deformation was simply @xmath24 . for uniaxial compression along the @xmath27-direction ,",
    "the only non - zero component of @xmath28 is @xmath29_{100}$ ] .",
    "if plastic flow occurs , then the material is always heated to some degree .",
    "plastic flow occurs through the motion and generation of defects in the crystal lattice , such as dislocations . usually in polycrystalline materials , defects accumulate during plastic deformation .",
    "heating generally represents less than the total plastic work as some potential energy is absorbed in the structure of defects . the fraction of plastic work converted to heat @xmath30 is thought to be 0.85 - 0.95 .",
    "it was assumed here to be 0.9 .",
    "thus the contribution of plastic work to heating was @xmath31 if @xmath32 and zero otherwise .    when a metal is deformed , shear strains result in the accumulation of elastic energy until the flow stress is reached . continued deformation results in plastic work .",
    "if the material work - hardens , the rate of plastic working increases .",
    "if thermal softening occurs , the rate of plastic working decreases but the stored elastic energy is also converted to plastic work .",
    "in an idealized material exhibiting a constant flow stress ( elastic - perfectly plastic ) , arbitrarily large amounts of plastic work may be accumulated by large deformations  uniaxial as well as pure shear  beyond the flow stress .",
    "ceramics may behave differently , the flow stress decreasing to a small fraction of its initial value as deformation continues beyond the elastic limit @xcite , presumably as interatomic bonds are broken and brittle damage occurs .",
    "many transparent materials are ceramic ; this reduction of the flow stress may explain why good agreement has been obtained between shock temperatures and predictions neglecting heating from the constitutive response @xcite .",
    "plastic flow is largely irreversible .",
    "if a sample of material is shock loaded and then released , the pressure reduces on release but further plastic work is done .",
    "mo was represented by an empirical eos fitted to shock compression data @xcite , with a deviatoric strength model developed and calibrated to data on the amplitude and shape of elastic waves running ahead of shocks @xcite .",
    "the eos was likely to be accurate to a few percent in temperature for the shock pressures of a few tens of gigapascals considered here .",
    "the steinberg - guinan strength model includes a prediction of the flow stress at elevated pressures .",
    "the flow stress , and hence the heating from plastic flow , was uncertain at the level of a few tens of percent .",
    "as discussed below , measurements of surface velocity provided an independent measure of the flow stress .",
    "material models for continuum dynamics are often implemented in varying ways in different computer programs .",
    "the results may depend on details such as the way in which numerical limits , e.g. on flow stress , are applied . in our simulations ,",
    "the eos was represented by an expression for pressure @xmath1 in terms of mass density @xmath4 and specific internal energy @xmath5 .",
    "this is sufficient to allow the dynamical equations for the continuum to be integrated in time .",
    "two different eos were used , a tabular form from the ` sesame ' library @xcite , and an analytic form of the grneisen type , using the principal hugoniot as the reference curve @xcite : shock speed @xmath6 in terms of particle speed @xmath33 , @xmath34 together with a relation for the grneisen parameter @xmath35 the shear modulus @xmath36 and flow stress @xmath37 followed the steinberg - guinan model @xcite , which includes explicit dependence on temperature @xmath38 and accumulated plastic strain @xmath39 : @xmath40 \\\\ y(p , t ) & = & y_0 f(\\epsilon_p ) g(p , t)/g_0 \\\\",
    "f(\\epsilon_p ) & = & \\mbox{min}\\left[(1+\\beta\\tilde\\epsilon_p)^n , y_{\\mbox{max}}/y_0\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the scaling of flow stress by shear modulus , the maximum flow stress at high pressures was not limited by the ` maximum ' flow stress @xmath41  this allowed the flow stress to be significantly greater than @xmath41 in the mo impact experiments .",
    "the usual definition of the steinberg - guinan model @xcite includes an explicit initial plastic strain from manufacture ; we treated @xmath39 as a local material parameter in addition to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the elastic strain , and set @xmath18 to a non - zero value in the initial conditions if required .",
    "the factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 used in calculating the scalar effective magnitudes of the corresponding tensors were chosen for consistency with the definitions of stress and strain used in deducing strength parameters for mo from experiments : @xmath44 .",
    "the sesame eos were defined as a pair of tables @xmath45 , so the @xmath16 relation was obtained by numerical inversion and the temperature was readily calculated .",
    "temperatures were calculated from the grneisen eos with reference to a compression curve along which the temperature and specific internal energy were known , @xmath46 , and using a specific heat capacity defined as a function of density @xmath47 ( constant in practice ) . the reference curve chosen was the zero kelvin isotherm ( ` cold curve ' ) , @xmath48k .",
    "this was calculated from the principal isentrope @xmath49 using the estimated density variation of grneisen parameter : @xmath50 the isentrope was calculated by numerical integration of the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath51 mechanical properties and temperatures calculated by either eos gave the same result to @xmath52 , which constitutes good agreement for models in material dynamics .",
    "the grneisen eos have slightly smoother loci , so the results presented below are from this eos .",
    "simulations were performed in units of millimeters , gigapascals , microseconds , kelvin , and mg / m@xmath53=g / cm@xmath53 .",

    "the lif release temperatures were clearly more consistent with plastic work as predicted using the steinberg - guinan model than with hydrodynamic flow ( no strength ) .",
    "the uncertainties in temperature were however too large to discriminate between strength models to better than several tens of percent in flow stress .",
    "heating from plastic work was calculated to be around 50k for shock pressures around 60gpa , 90k on subsequent release into lif , and 125k on release at a free surface .",
