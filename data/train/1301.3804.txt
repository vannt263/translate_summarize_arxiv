    "interior to mercury s orbit is a dynamically stable region where a population of small , asteroid - like bodies called vulcanoids has long been hypothesized to exist , cf .",
    "review by @xcite .",
    "this region , known as the vulcanoid zone , extends from roughly 0.07 au to 0.21 au ( 1545 solar radii ) .",
    "seen from earth , objects in the vulcanoid zone have maximum solar elongation angles of just 412@xmath5 .",
    "the outer boundary of the vulcanoid zone , at 0.21 au , is set by dynamical instability .",
    "objects with semi - major axes greater than this limit evolve onto mercury - crossing orbits on 100-myr timescales due to orbital perturbations caused by both mercury and venus @xcite .",
    "the inner edge of the vulcanoid zone is less well - defined , but is set by the combination of the intense thermal environment and dynamical transport mechanisms such as poynting - robertson drag and the yarkovsky effect . at 0.06 au (  13 solar radii ) solar radiation",
    "is so intense that even a pure iron body 100  km in diameter will evaporate in less than 4.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "the time an object can survive against evaporation is a strong function of heliocentric distance , such that , at 0.07 au , a pure iron body of just 2  km diameter will survive for the current age of the solar system .",
    "poynting - robertson drag extends the evaporation limit outward , as it can move a 2-km diameter object with @xmath6  g  @xmath7 from 0.08 to 007  au in 4  gyr , where it will evaporate @xcite .",
    "the detection of one or more members of the putative vulcanoid population is of interest as it would represent the discovery of a whole new class of solar system objects .",
    "if they existed at all , primordial vulcanoids likely formed from the highest temperature condensates near the inner edge of the solar nebula , and they presumably would contain unique , highly refractory , chemical signatures as a result .",
    "in addition , a primordial vulcanoid population might have affected mercury s surface chronology .",
    "based on the size - frequency distribution of craters on the moon , mars , venus , and mercury , it is thought that objects in the inner solar system were resurfaced during the period of the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) 3.9  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "vulcanoids removed from stable orbits in the vulcanoid zone by non - gravitational forces like the yarkovsky effect @xcite could have supplied a significant impactor population to mercury after the lhb , making the surface appear older @xcite .",
    "@xcite first proposed that a small planet , or collection of planets , interior to mercury could explain the observed precession of mercury s orbit .",
    "this hypothesized planet was eventually given the name `` vulcan '' , and numerous searches were conducted in an attempt to find it .",
    "however , the proximity of intramercurial objects to the sun makes them difficult to observe from the earth . to overcome the observational challenge of looking for a faint object against a bright twilight sky , many of the early searches for the planet vulcan were conducted in the fleeting minutes of totality during solar",
    "eclipses . the first searches for vulcan were done visually , with obvious limitations . the first use of photographic plates to search for an intra - mercurial planet was by @xcite , during the total solar eclipse of may 18 , 1901 , on the island of sumatra . after analyzing the plates from this expedition ,",
    "perrine placed a limit of magnitude 5.0 ( photographic ) on the brightness of any planet interior to mercury and concluded that , `` ... there are probably no bodies of appreciable size in the region close about the sun , and that the cause of the disturbance in the motion of mercury must be sought elsewhere . ''",
    "subsequent observations during solar eclipses resulted in an improved limiting magnitude of 8.0 @xcite .    in 1915",
    ", @xcite showed that the precession of mercury s orbit could be explained entirely by the then new theory of general relativity , thus eliminating the dynamical need for a massive planet vulcan .",
    "however , the question of whether there are any small bodies interior to mercury s orbit remained unresolved . an archival search by @xcite using photographic plates obtained during the solar eclipse of 1922 for the purpose of measuring the deflection of starlight predicted by general relativity provided the tightest constraint of all the early searches : a photographic magnitude of 8.5 .",
    "more recently , @xcite , summarizing a 10-year campaign to observe comets during solar eclipses , reported , `` ... data which indicate the possible existence of one or more relatively faint objects within twenty solar radii ... and [ ranging ] from + 9 to + 7 in equivalent visual magnitude '' .",
    "unfortunately , the nature of observing during total solar eclipses precluded any direct follow - up observations of these possible detections . since these results remain unpublished and have not been independently confirmed , it is difficult to assess whether the claimed detections are real , and , if they are , whether the objects are vulcanoids , sungrazing comets ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , or some other type of body .",
    "in contrast to all other published vulcanoid searches , @xcite conducted a search for vulcanoids between 1979 and 1981 at 3.5  @xmath8 m . by virtue of operating in the thermal infrared",
    ", this search was more sensitive to objects with low visual albedo .",
    "leake et al . estimated a detection probability of 75% for an object with an l - band magnitude of 5 , corresponding to an object diameter of 40 - 50 km .",
    "however , bad weather and the small field of view ( fov ) of their instrument limited their search to a total of 5.8 deg@xmath9 within 1@xmath5 of the ecliptic  a small fraction of the vulcanoid zone , as seen from earth .    prior to our work , the most complete search , in terms of depth and coverage , was conducted by @xcite , using data from the lasco c3 coronagraph on the soho spacecraft @xcite , which images a region from 0.020.14 au ( 3.730 solar radii ) .",
    "durda et al . , examined a 40-day sequence of lasco c3 images .",
    "except for objects at the outer edge of the vulcanoid zone with inclination @xmath1025@xmath5 , all dynamically stable vulcanoids should have passed through the instrument fov during this period .",
    "no vulcanoids were found , down to detection limit of v=8.0 . for objects with a mercury - like albedo and phase function @xcite",
    ", this limit corresponds to a diameter of 22 and 65  km for objects at the inner and outer edges of the vulcanoid zone ( or 36 - 106  km for an albedo of 0.05 ) .",
    "working independently , @xcite also did not detect any vulcanoids in lasco c3 images down to a limiting magnitude of v=7 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite conducted a vulcanoid search using a visible wavelength imaging system flown aboard nasa f / a-18b aircraft at an altitude of 49,000 feet .",
    "however , they were unable to improve upon the earlier @xcite results .",
    "@xcite report preliminary results from their search for vulcanoids using the wide angle camera ( wac ) of the messenger spacecraft s mercury dual imaging system ( mdis ) , while the spacecraft was in cruise to mercury .",
    "spacecraft pointing restrictions limited observations to those with solar elongation @xmath1030@xmath5 , i.e. , the outer 45% of the vulcanoid zone .",
    "no vulcanoids were detected , down to a limiting magnitude of v=8 , corresponding to an vulcanoid diameter of 15  km .",
    "subsequent analysis of these observations has brought this size limit down to 5  km , comparable to the results of our search ( w.  j.  merline , private communication , 2012 ) .",
    "finally , @xcite report a vulcanoid search using 15  cm telescopes equipped with ccds at two separate observatories in china during the 2008 total solar eclipse .",
    "they found `` three unidentified star - like objects '' in images from both telescopes , but the relative motion of these objects did not match that of a vulcanoid . both the angular size and sensitivity of this search are unclear , although they report that stars as faint as v=12.8 were detected .",
    "for our search , we used archival data from the heliospheric imager ( hi ) instrument on nasa s stereo spacecraft , available online from the stereo science center ( http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov ) .",
    "the solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) mission is designed to study coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) from the sun out to the orbit of the earth and consists of two nearly identical spacecraft .",
    "stereo - a orbits the sun slightly interior to earth s orbit , while the other spacecraft , stereo - b , orbits the sun slightly exterior to earth s orbit @xcite . seen from the sun , the angular separation between the earth and the two spacecraft increases by 22.5@xmath5 per year .",
    "our search focused on data from stereo - a , as it has more stable pointing than stereo - b .",
    "the hi instrument , itself part of the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ) , consists of two separate imagers : hi-1 , with a 20@xmath5 square fov centered in the ecliptic plane at a solar elongation of 14@xmath5 , and hi-2 , with a 70@xmath5 fov centered on the ecliptic plane at a solar elongation of 53@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the hi instruments use a series of baffles to prevent scattered light from the sun from reaching the detector ; as a result , hi is significantly more sensitive to faint targets like cmes ( or vulcanoids ) than traditional coronagraphic imagers .",
    "the hi-1a imager is particularly well - suited to searching for vulcanoids , as all objects on dynamically stable orbits will be in the fov at their eastern elongation , provided the following inequality is satisfied :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the semi - major axis , eccentricity , and inclination of the vulcanoid s orbit ; @xmath15  au is the heliocentric distance of the stereo - a spacecraft ; and @xmath16 is the angle between the sun and the inner edge of the fov .",
    "this inequality is satisfied for all orbits with @xmath17  au , @xmath18 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the hi-1 detector is a 2048@xmath192048 pixel ccd . to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for observing faint cmes",
    ", hi-1 typically integrates for 1200s .",
    "a single 1200s exposure would be significantly degraded by cosmic ray hits , which affect roughly 45 pixels s@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "instead , hi-1 typically acquires 30 separate 40-second exposures .",
    "since the data volume required to transmit all these images to earth at full resolution would be prohibitive , the individual images are processed and combined onboard the spacecraft .",
    "the image processing includes a cosmic ray removal algorithm that compares each new image with the previous image on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "if the value in a given pixel exceeds that in the previous image by more than 5@xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the predicted standard deviation based on the number of photoelectrons detected , that value is replaced with the value in the previous image . as seen from stereo - a , the apparent motion of a vulcanoid between 40s exposures is @xmath21 .",
    "given the 35size of the hi-1 pixels , a full - width at half - maximum value of the psf of 3.34 pixels in the x - direction and 2.96 pixels in the y - direction @xcite , the rate of apparent motion for vulcanoids , and that the signal from the solar f - corona is much brighter than the signal expected from a vulcanoid , this cosmic ray removal algorithm does not affect the ability of the instrument to detect potential vulcanoids .",
    "after the cosmic ray removal , the bias level , as determined from a column in the ccd underscan region , is subtracted from the data and the images are binned by a factor of two",
    ". the resulting sequence of 1024@xmath191024 pixel images are then summed and compressed using a lossless algorithm , and in general , only these processed , summed images are sent back to earth . in normal operations ,",
    "these 1200s combined images are obtained with a cadence of 40 minutes .",
    "hi data are available in three levels of processing : l0 , l1 , and l2 .",
    "l0 data consists of the raw , uncalibrated image data .",
    "l1 data have been processed to correct for flat - field effects , image alignment , and the shutterless readout .",
    "as shown in panel a of fig .",
    "[ hi1_images_fig ] , both l0 and l1 data are dominated by light scattered from the solar f - corona ( zodiacal light ) . in a typical 40x40 pixel region near the right - hand edge of the image ,",
    "the median value is 118  dn / s .",
    "the signal from the f - corona is fairly stable with time , so it can be effectively removed from the data by subtracting a composite image formed from data taken over a sufficiently long baseline . in the l2 data , the composite image to be subtracted is created by averaging over the lowest 25% of pixel values obtained during either a 1- or 11-day running window at each pixel in the image .",
    "the result of l2 processing can be seen in panel b of fig .",
    "[ hi1_images_fig ] . the same 40x40 pixel region has a median value of 0.2  dn / s in the l2 data .",
    "we used l2 data from the hi-1 instrument of stereo - a ( henceforth hi-1a ) with the 11-day running window in our search .",
    "with the f - corona effectively removed , cmes and coronal streamers are readily apparent in the hi-1 data .",
    "although the stereo mission is designed to study solar phenomena such as these , for the purpose of searching for vulcanoids they constitute an additional source of background `` noise '' .",
    "if not removed , this additional background , which is more significant at smaller angular distances from the sun , will result in reduced sensitivity to vulcanoids with small semi - major axes .",
    "we attempted to remove this two - dimensional , time - varying background from the l2 data by subtracting off the `` sky '' level in a circular annulus centered on each pixel .",
    "based on an average psf fwhm value of 1.57 pixels ( binned ) , we adopted radii of 4.7 and 7.9 pixels ( 3@xmath19 and 5@xmath19 the fwhm ) for our sky background annulus .",
    "this method removes signal from diffuse features while preserving point sources .",
    "a sky - subtracted image is shown in panel c of fig .",
    "[ hi1_images_fig ] .",
    "after this sky - subtraction , the median value in the 40x40 region fell to 8@xmath22  dn / s .",
    "since the pointing of the stereo spacecraft was held fixed relative to the sun , background stars appear to drift through the hi-1 fov . to facilitate the identification of objects moving relative to the inertial frame",
    ", we co - registered all sky - subtracted l2 data obtained during a two - day window ( typically a series of 72 images ) .",
    "the first image in the sequence was used to define an astrometric reference frame .",
    "we then calculated centroid positions for several hundred stars common to both images and used these to derive a third degree , two - dimensional polynomial transform that maps the second image into the frame of the reference image .",
    "this polynomial technique handles optical distortions near the edges of the instrument fov better than a simple linear shift .",
    "after the data were co - registered , we subtracted a 9-image running median from each image to reduce the signal from any sources that remained fixed in inertial coordinates , e.g. , stars .",
    "an example of the final processed image is shown in panel d of fig  [ hi1_images_fig ] .      to quantify the detection efficiency of our search , we generated a population of 101 synthetic vulcanoids and added them to the l2 hi-1a data , with the appropriate level of poisson noise , before our additional image processing .",
    "the orbital properties of the synthetic vulcanoids were chosen to mimic those of the putative vulcanoid population . during the search , the observers knew that synthetic vulcanoids were present in the data , but they did not know where the synthetic objects were , how many objects were in a given image ( between 23 and 42 with an average of 33 ) , or whether a given object that was detected was real or synthetic .",
    "each of the 101 synthetic vulcanoids was randomly assigned a value for the longitude of its ascending node , argument of periapsis , and mean anomaly at epoch . given the fov of the hi-1a instrument , we limited the range of orbital eccentricities to 00.15 and inclinations to 015@xmath23 , with the value for each chosen randomly .",
    "prior work by @xcite has also shown that vulcanoids are more likely to be found on highly circular orbits near the outer edge of the vulcanoid zone . for the synthetic population as a whole , @xmath24=0.07 and @xmath25=7.7@xmath5 .",
    "half of the synthetic vulcanoids were given a semi - major axis randomly - distributed between 0.070.14  a.u . ; the other half were given semi - major axes distributed randomly between 0.140.21  a.u .",
    "for each image to be examined , we calculated the positions of the synthetic objects in detector coordinates , and if the object was within the instrument field of view , we added a 2-d gaussian psf ( fwhm of 1.67 pixels in the x - dimension and 1.48 pixels in the y - dimension ) with poisson noise to the image .",
    "the positions of the synthetic vulcanoids , in detector coordinates , over the 40-day search period are shown in fig  [ orbits_fig ] .",
    "the apparent brightness of some vulcanoids can change by nearly three orders of magnitude as they move through the hi-1a field of view .",
    "this is primarily a result of the large range of phase angles at which they can be observed ( roughly 20@xmath5 - 160@xmath5 for a vulcanoids in the outer vulcanoid zone and 60@xmath5 - 120@xmath5 for vulcanoids in the inner vulcanoid zone ) as well as potentially significant changes in the object s heliocentric distance and distance to the stereo - a spacecraft while they are in the field of view .",
    "the synthetic vulcanoids were assumed to be spherical and within each group ( @xmath26 au and @xmath27 au ) , they were assigned diameters that uniformly spanned the range of 0.750  km , in logarithmically - spaced steps . the total signal ( in dn / s ) from each synthetic vulcanoid was calculated according to the following equation :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the collection area of hi-1a ( @xmath30 where @xmath31  cm ) , @xmath32 is the diameter of the vulcanoid in km , @xmath33  km is the astronomical unit ( au ) , @xmath34 is the heliocentric distance of the vulcanoid in au , @xmath35 is the distance from stereo - a to the vulcanoid in au , @xmath36 is the system gain ( 15 photoelectrons / dn ) , @xmath37 is the number of photons of wavelength @xmath38 per erg , @xmath39 is the solar flux at 1  au in erg s@xmath20 @xmath40 nm@xmath20 , @xmath41 is the absolute reflectance of the vulcanoid at @xmath38 and phase angle @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the instrument response ( which includes the ccd quantum efficiency ) . finally , @xmath44 is the correction factor for hi-1a between the theoretically predicted counts and counts actually measured @xcite .",
    "[ flux_eqn ] is integrated between 3001100 nm , the range over which hi-1 is sensitive .",
    "the instrument response curve of hi-1a , @xmath43 , contains a broad central peak from 600 - 750  nm , roughly similar to the johnson r filter .",
    "however , there are significant side bands at 400  nm and 950  nm ( cf . fig .  6 in bewsher et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "for an object with a mercury - like spectrum , roughly 90% of the detected flux will be in the central pass band , 4% in the 400  nm side band , and 6% in the 950  nm side band .",
    "the solar spectrum , @xmath45 , was obtained from the hst calspec database @xcite .",
    "the synthetic vulcanoids were assumed to have spectral reflectance properties identical to that of the planet mercury , except with 1/3 the albedo , i.e. , scaled to p@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this albedo is comparable to that of c - type asteroids @xcite . for objects with a different albedo , @xmath47  p@xmath48 .",
    "the absolute reflectance of mercury , as measured by the mdis and mascs instruments on the messenger spacecraft at 11 wavelengths between 4281013  nm at 5 phase angles from 35@xmath5129@xmath5 by @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ merc_spec_fig ] . for wavelengths between 300428  nm and 10131100  nm",
    ", we linearly extrapolate the mdis / mascs data . for reflectances at phase angles between 35@xmath5129@xmath5 ,",
    "we interpolate the mdis / mascs data , while for phase angles between 20@xmath535@xmath5/129@xmath5160@xmath5 we scale the reflectance spectrum at 35@xmath5/129@xmath5 by the v - band mercury phase function of @xcite .",
    "although we have used mercury s reflectance spectrum in our analysis , our results are insensitive to the choice of spectrum for reasonable solar system alternatives , such as typical s- or c - type asteroids , when that spectrum is scaled to an r - band albedo of 0.047 .",
    "after processing the data and adding synthetic vulcanoids as described above , we created movies from the images obtained during a two - day period .",
    "we then looped this movie back and forth , at variable frame rates , while visually searching for moving objects .",
    "when an object was found , the observer marked its position in one or more frames of the movie .",
    "this technique takes advantage of the ability of the human eye to detect motion ; very often an object that was easily identifiable while cycling through the movie would be virtually indistinguishable from background noise when looking at an individual image . after searching through all of the movies ,",
    "the list of marked objects for each movie was compared to the positions of the synthetic vulcanoids and main belt asteroids in that movie .",
    "even with a population of just 101 synthetic vulcanoids , with 70  pixels , there were multiple instances in which there were two synthetic vulcanoids within a five - pixel radius of a marked position .",
    "these were automatically flagged for further review . unless it was clear that both objects were marked in the same frame , only the brighter of the two synthetic vulcanoids",
    "was recorded as being detected .",
    "any marked position not matching the location of a synthetic vulcanoid or main belt asteroid was flagged for further inspection . with one exception ( discussed in section  [ comet_section ] )",
    ", these were subsequently determined to be false positives  usually the result of a interpolating a single `` warm '' pixel or a spurious grouping of random noise .    although there are now several years of stereo hi-1 data , the labor - intensive nature of our search technique placed practical limitations on the amount of data that could be analyzed . the longest synodic period between an object in a dynamically stable vulcanoid orbit ( i.e. having a semi - major axis @xmath49  au ) and",
    "an observer at 1  au is 39 days .",
    "we therefore selected a 40-day period from 2008 - 12 - 10 to 2009 - 01 - 19 to examine in our search , based on the low solar activity and avoidance of the galactic center .",
    "( we had previously examined the 40-day period from 2009 - 01 - 19 to 2009 - 03 - 01 and found no vulcanoids @xcite , but we used a less effective sky subtraction technique resulting in a less sensitive search than the one described in this paper ) . for",
    "any given 40-day period , a vulcanoid at the outer edge of the vulcanoid zone will spend roughly 15 days continuously in the hi-1a field of view during its single pass through elongation .",
    "in contrast , a vulcanoid at the inner edge of the vulcanoid zone will spend roughly 30 hours in the hi-1a fov per elongation , but will pass through elongation 5 or 6 times .",
    "as has been pointed out by many others before us , given a careful observer , the human eye is often better at finding low s / n point sources with fewer false positives than automated search algorithms .",
    "this is especially true given the relatively dense stellar backgrounds in the hi-1 images and the large range of apparent motions that vulcanoids can exhibit ( anywhere from no apparent motion at all up to a few hundred arcseconds per hour , positive or negative , in both right ascension and declination ) .",
    "however , using human observers to manually look for vulcanoids introduces a certain stochastic element to the search . to minimize the chance that a faint vulcanoid might be missed due to observer fatigue or random chance , each movie",
    "was independently examined by four separate observers ( ajs , njc , abs , and ddd ) .",
    "finally , we note that based on this work and previous searches , e.g. the search for small satellites of pluto of @xcite , adding synthetic objects to the data not only provides a quantitative means of estimating the detection efficiency but actually results in a more sensitive search .",
    "the tedium of searching through large numbers of images for point sources marginally brighter than the background while failing to find any can quickly lead to observer fatigue and a less thorough search .",
    "however , the simple positive reinforcement of finding an object in the data , whether synthetic or not , can help keep a human observer focused on the search , despite its repetitive nature .",
    "no vulcanoids were detected in our search .",
    "although we did not detect any vulcanoids , we observed a variety of other solar system objects : the planets mercury , venus , uranus , and neptune ; the comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ; more than 30 kruetz - family sungrazing comets @xcite ; the non - group sungrazing comets c/2008 y12 ( soho ) and c/2009 a1 ( stereo ) ; and numerous main - belt asteroids , some as faint as v=13.8 , as determined by the jpl horizons ephemeris @xcite .",
    "in addition , 58 of the 101 synthetic vulcanoids added to the data were detected by at least one of the four observers , which we use to place upper limits on the size of any putative vulcanoids . finally ,",
    "as discussed below , we initially classified the sun - grazing comet c/2008 y12 ( soho ) as a candidate vulcanoid .",
    "this resulted in an additional search through all images from the hi-1 instruments on both stereo - a and stereo - b over the period from 2008 - 12 - 08 to 2009 - 03 - 01 .",
    "we found no vulcanoids in this additional search but can not place quantitative limits on this additional non - detection , as no synthetic vulcanoids were added .",
    "the detection efficiency of vulcanoids , whether real or synthetic , will clearly be a strong function of the object s size , as the larger the object , the brighter it appears .",
    "it is also possible that our search might be biased towards detecting objects with a certain range of orbital parameter values .",
    "for example , in our prior vulcanoid search we found that given two synthetic vulcanoids of the same size , the one with the greater orbital semi - major axis was more likely to be detected @xcite . to identify whether any such biases were present in our current search , we plot the orbital parameters of the synthetic vulcanoid population as a function of diameter in figs .  [ orbpars_vs_diam ] and [ orbpars_vs_diam2 ] .",
    "synthetic vulcanoids that were detected by at least one observer have filled symbols and those that were not detected at all have open symbols . from these figures , it is immediately clear that there is an extremely strong dependence on object size , with all 57 synthetic vulcanoids larger than 5  km in diameter being detected by at least one observer and only 1 of the 44 synthetic vulcanoids smaller than 5  km in diameter being detected ( and then , only by one observer ) . however , there is no obvious correlation between whether an object was detected and any of its orbital parameters .    to quantitatively",
    "verify our search s insensitivity to a vulcanoid s orbital parameters , we divided the synthetic vulcanoids into two populations based on whether they were detected or not and conducted a series of statistical tests .",
    "these are described in more detail in the appendix .",
    "none of these tests showed any significant deviations from a random uniform distribution or correlations between pairs of parameters .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result .",
    "evidently the sky annulus subtraction technique described in section  [ data_section ] , has removed the bias towards detecting objects with larger semi - major axes observed in our initial search . given the relatively low number of synthetic vulcanoids ( 101 ) ,",
    "it was not possible to investigate whether any statistically significant groupings of three or more orbital parameters exist .",
    "we present the number of synthetic vulcanoid detections for each observer , x@xmath50 , as a function of size in table  [ deteff_table ] .",
    "we have grouped the objects into 13 size bins , corresponding to a factor of @xmath51 in diameter . as might be expected ,",
    "there is some disparity between the detection rates of the four observers , with observer 1 detecting 58 of the 101 synthetic vulcanoids and observer 4 detecting 50 of the 101 synthetic vulcanoids .",
    "surprisingly , though , all the differences between the observers occurred for objects 4 - 8  km diameter .",
    "all four observers detected all 45 objects larger than  8 km and none of the 38 objects smaller than 4  km .",
    "for each observer , the detection efficiency , @xmath52 , in a given size bin is simply x@xmath50/n .",
    "we plot @xmath52 for each of the four individual observers as well as @xmath53 , the average detection efficiency of all observers vs. object diameter in fig .",
    "[ deteff_fig ] .",
    "1@xmath2 confidence intervals for the @xmath53 are derived from monte carlo analysis , as described below .",
    "we find @xmath54 ( 32/40 ) for objects between 5.7 - 8.0  km diameter and @xmath55 ( 4/32 ) for objects between 4.0 - 5.7  km .",
    "given the individual detection efficiencies , we calculate the probability , p@xmath56 , that at least one of the four observers would detect a single object , as a function of size .",
    "subject to the assumptions stated in section  [ synthetic_section ] ( namely a r - band vulcanoid albedo of p@xmath4=0.05 ) we find that our search should have detected all vulcanoids larger than 5.7  km in diameter .",
    "however this approach ignores the statistical uncertainty in the observed values of @xmath52 , which arises from the small number of synthetic vulcanoids in each size bin .",
    "we use a monte carlo model to quantitatively determine the effect of statistical uncertainty on our limits . for each size bin and observer ( or the sum of the four observers , in the case of @xmath53 ) we set the detection efficiency , @xmath52 , equal to a pseudo - random number generated over the interval [ 0 , 1 ] , inclusive . using the probability mass function for the binomial distribution",
    ", we calculated the probability of detecting exactly x@xmath50 synthetic vulcanoids , given n vulcanoids in the size bin and @xmath52 .",
    "we then generated a second pseudo - random number between 0 and 1 , and if it was less than or equal to this probability the test was considered successful at reproducing the observations and we recorded the value of @xmath52 .",
    "this process was repeated until 10@xmath57 values for @xmath52 were recorded .",
    "1@xmath2 confidence intervals were produced by sorting the recorded values of @xmath52 into ascending order and finding the minimum contiguous interval ( @xmath58 ) that contained 68.3% of the @xmath52 values .",
    "these confidence intervals are shown in table  [ deteff_table ] .    to determine the probability that a single vulcanoid would be detected by at least one observer , we randomly selected one of the recorded values for @xmath52 for each observer and tested whether this value was less than or equal to a pseudo - random number , i.e. if that observer failed to detect the object .",
    "if this test was true for all four observers , the vulcanoid escaped detection .",
    "we repeated this 10@xmath57 times and counted the total number of times the vulcanoid was detected .",
    "the probability of a single vulcanoid being detected by least one observer , given statistical uncertainties , p@xmath59 , is shown in table  [ deteff_table ] .",
    "we note that the values for p@xmath59 are significantly higher than p@xmath56 for vulcanoids below 5.7  km in diameter .",
    "this is due to the fact that , given the small values for n , even if x@xmath60 , it is not possible to exclude a non - zero value for @xmath52 with a high degree of confidence .",
    "for example , observer 4 detected 0 of 8 objects between 4.0 - 5.7  km , but even a value of @xmath61 would yield this result 5% of the time .",
    "thus , when at least one observer has an observed detection efficiency , @xmath52 , close to zero , p@xmath59 is likely too high .",
    "the converse is also true : when at least one observer has @xmath52 close to unity , p@xmath59 is likely an underestimate . with this in mind , we are able to place a 3@xmath2 upper limit ( i.e. , a confidence level @xmath100.997 ) on the existence of any vulcanoids larger than 5.7  km in diameter .",
    "as stated above , our size limits are dependent on the value of the r - band albedo , p@xmath62 , we assumed for vulcanoids .",
    "if the actual albedo of vulcanoids is different from this value , our diameter limits scale as p@xmath63 .      in our search",
    ", we found one object that did not correspond to a synthetic vulcanoid or any known object in the iau minor planet center s database ( gareth williams , private communication , 2011 ) .",
    "this object was first detected in an image from 2008 - 12 - 21t17:44 ut and appeared in 15 consecutive hi-1a images before its apparent motion carried it outside the instrument s fov .",
    "although the object s motion was similar to several to the synthetic vulcanoids , it appeared somewhat diffuse and brightened as it moved closer to the sun .",
    "we thus suspected that this candidate vulcanoid might be a previously undetected sungrazing comet .",
    "however , given the short 9.3-hour arc and 70  pixels it was not possible to obtain a unique orbital solution .",
    "we therefore began a concerted effort to see if the object could be re - acquired in images from the hi-1 instruments on either stereo - a or stereo - b obtained over the 83-day period from 2008 - 12 - 08 to 2009 - 03 - 01 .",
    "these data were processed and searched using the techniques described above , but without the addition of any synthetic vulcanoids . ultimately , we were not able to reacquire the object and no other candidate vulcanoids were detected . since we were specifically looking to reacquire the candidate object in the data , this secondary search was likely not as sensitive to vulcanoids in general as our primary search .",
    "however , lacking any synthetic vulcanoids to detect , we can not quantitatively verify this hypothesis .",
    "given that in our primary search , all four observers detected all 45 synthetic objects larger than 8  km , it seems likely that were such an object present in this extended data set , it would have been detected .",
    "this gives us additional confidence that some unknown systematic effect unique to either the hi-1a or the time period from 2008 - 12 - 10 to 2009 - 01 - 19 is not preventing the detection of a real vulcanoid .",
    "subsequently , we learned of the comet c/2008 y12 ( soho ) , which was discovered in 7 images from the lasco c2 coronagraph on the soho spacecraft , starting on 2008 - 12 - 22t16:54less than 14 hours after the vulcanoid candidate was last seen in the hi-1a images . the predicted positions of c/2008 y12 ( soho ) in the hi-1a images using the initial orbital fit @xcite were not a good match to our candidate object .",
    "however , we were able to find a single set of orbital parameters that yielded average positional residuals of 37  for the vulcanoid candidate in the stereo hi-1a images and 3  for c/2008 y12 ( soho ) in the soho lasco - c2 images  less than half the size of the respective detector pixels . after reporting these results to the iau minor planet center ,",
    "a new orbital fit was published @xcite .",
    "however , this published fit assumed an eccentricity of 1.0 , and as a result , it is significantly less accurate than our orbital fit shown in table  [ elements_table ] .",
    "although it is dynamically stable , the vulcanoid zone is in a rough neighborhood .",
    "it occupies a comparatively small volume of space and due to its proximity to the sun , orbital velocities are large .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that even for a wide variety of assumptions about the size and material properties of a hypothetical population , vulcanoids will experience significant collisional disruption and erosion unless the mean orbital eccentricity of the population is extremely small ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "however , dynamical studies by @xcite showed that test particles between 0.09 and 0.20  au on initially circular orbits with zero inclination evolved dynamically such that , after just 100  myr , the population had a mean eccentricity of @xmath65 and a mean maximum eccentricity over the 100  myr of @xmath66 .",
    "this increase in mean eccentricity is due to the interaction of various orbital resonances with mercury as its orbit evolved over the simulation . for a vulcanoid population with mean eccentricity of @xmath65 , typical encounter velocities between vulcanoids will be in the range of 10 - 20  km  s@xmath20 and collisional disruption / erosion is extremely efficient . for an initial vulcanoid population with a power - law index of -2.5 , 300 objects larger than 1  km radius , and",
    "@xmath67 , high - energy collisions with small bodies reduced all objects to debris , no larger than 1  km radius , in 1.2  gyr @xcite .",
    "for an initial population of 10@xmath68 objects with r@xmath69  km , this collisional destruction timescale was just 1.6  myr .",
    "however , radiative transport mechanisms like the yarkovsky effect would have quickly removed the smaller collisional remnants . in simulations by @xcite all vulcanoids 1  km in diameter and smaller were removed from the vulcanoid zone by yarkovsky drift , with typical lifetimes of 100  myr for 0.1  km objects and 500  myr for 1  km objects .",
    "even objects up to 10  km in size showed strong depletion ( 80%100% ) over the age of the solar system . by removing the small body population",
    ", the yarkovsky effect might greatly reduce the efficiency of collisional erosion in the vulcanoid zone . to date , there have been no studies combining the effects of collisional evolution and yarkovsky drift in the vulcanoid zone .",
    "if we assume that the present - day vulcanoid population both exists and obeys a steady - state collisional fragmentation size distribution , @xmath70 @xcite , then our @xmath71 upper limit implies that no more than 76 primordial vulcanoids remain in the vulcanoid zone  the last remnants of a much larger initial population .",
    "such vulcanoids would all be larger than 1  km in diameter , as primordial objects smaller than this will have been removed from the vulcanoid zone by yarkovsky drift . however , since the combination of collisional evolution and yarkovsky drift could result in either the complete depletion of a primordial vulcanoid population or something less than that , our upper limits can not be extrapolated to place any meaningful constraints on a hypothetical primordial vulcanoid population .",
    "finally , we note that if a vulcanoid is subsequently discovered ( hopefully below our detection limits ) it is possible that it may be a scattered near - earth object ( neo ) rather than a primordial vulcanoid .",
    "recent modeling of the orbital distribution of neos by @xcite suggests that up to 0.006% of the neo population might end up in orbits with an aphelion interior to mercury s aphelion .",
    "given that limit , an neo interloper might have an absolute magnitude as low as @xmath72 , corresponding to a diameter between 170 - 370  m , more than an order of magnitude smaller than the detection limits of our search .",
    "we kindly thank d. bewsher for providing the instrument response curves for stereo hi-1 , g.  m. holsclaw for providing the absolute reflectance of mercury as measured by mascs / mdis , t.  v. spahr for initial orbital solutions for the object that turned out to be c/2008 y12 ( soho ) , and k. battams for discussions about c/2008 y12 ( soho ) and its orbit .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa planetary geology and geophysics program through grant nnx09ad65 g .",
    "to determine if there were any statistically significant deviations in the detected and/or non - detected populations of synthetic vulcanoids , we conducted a series of statistical tests .",
    "the first test was to divide the range of possible values for each orbital parameter into four , equally - spaced bins . if the parameter values are randomly distributed , then the expectation is that 1/4 of the total population should have parameter values in the range covered by each bin .",
    "the cumulative binomial distribution can be used to determine the significance of any deviation from this expected value . the largest deviation from a random uniform distribution occurred in the non - detected population :",
    "the fourth semi - major axis bin had 17 objects , compared to an expectation value of 10.75an event with only a 2.5% probability .",
    "while this may seem marginally significant , given that we conducted 24 separate tests , we would expect one of them to have as large a deviation nearly 46% of the time .",
    "thus , we conclude there were no statistically significant deviations from a random normal distribution",
    ".    we also performed one- and two - sample kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) tests on the distributions of orbital parameters for both the detected and undetected populations .",
    "a one - sample k - s test compares the empirical distribution function of a sample population with the cumulative distribution function of a reference distribution ( in this case , a random uniform distribution ) and evaluates the significance of any deviations .",
    "none of the empirical distribution functions of the six orbital parameters for either of the two populations was significantly different from a random uniform distribution .",
    "similarly , a two - sample k - s test compares the empirical distribution functions of two sample populations to determine if they are consistent with being derived from the same parent distribution .",
    "we found no statistically significant difference between the parent distributions of the detected and non - detected populations for any of the six orbital parameters .",
    "finally , we examined each of the 21 combination of the six orbital parameters and vulcanoid diameter for both possible correlations . both the pearson linear correlation coefficient ( which measures how well two variables are linearly related ) and the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( which measures how well the relationship between the two variables can be described using a monotonic function ) exhibited near - zero values for all parameter combinations .      , d. , brown , d.  s. , eyles , c.  j. , kellett , b.  j. , white , g.  j. , swinyard , b. , jul . 2010 .",
