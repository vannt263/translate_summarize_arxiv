    "quantum state tomography ( qst ) @xcite is the first step in any quantum information processing ( qip ) . for a photon qubit , the state determination may be in any of the degrees of freedom , eg .",
    "polarization , phase space distribution , or occupancy in  the fock space @xcite . at the experimental end ,",
    "reconstruction of the quantum state is either by direct photon counting measurements or indirectly by optical homodyne /heterodyne",
    "measurements  as in the case of continuous variable tomography .",
    "james et al @xcite have proposed a general scheme for the reconstruction of the polarization state of a pair of entangled photons generated in type - ii parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) .",
    "the pdc two - photon probability distribution has also been determined experimentally @xcite by measuring the joint photon probability distribution .",
    "theoretically , vogel and risken @xcite have shown that the wigner function can be determined by optical homodyne detection ( ohd ) , which was subsequently followed by the experimental realization of the same @xcite .",
    "the phase - space quasi probability function has also been determined @xcite by photon counting measurements .",
    "single photon @xcite and two photon fock state tomography have been experimentally studied by lvovsky et al @xcite .",
    "spin state tomography has been studied using group theoretic methods @xcite .",
    "so far , tomography studies on photons have been mainly in pdc systems .",
    "preparation of a specific target state as required by the protocol of interest is also necessary for any qip . control of atomic sources for the realization of specific photon states may be achieved via coherent atom photon interactions where the driving field strengths and the detunings of the applied fields are the _ control _ parameters .",
    "an inevitable consequence of atom photon interactions ( coherent ) is the existence of strong quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "coherent driving fields interacting with the atoms give rise to strong atomic coherence which then gets transferred to the emitted radiation .",
    "quantum correlations , particularly the entanglement aspects , have been the most studied but not easily understood , especially when the state is not pure . on the other hand ,",
    "the preparation of pure entangled states itself poses a challenge .",
    "while pdc sources offer good fidelity the conversion efficiency is , however , very low since it is a second order process .",
    "further , the input field strength is the only control parameter .",
    "a further disadvantage is that there is no control over the emission statistics .",
    "on the other hand it is well known that the statistics of emission in resonance fluorescence can be made sub - poissonian or super - poissonian . in other words , there can be programmable delays between successive emissions .",
    "the disadvantage of monitoring emission in resonance fluorescence is that the emitted radiation is over @xmath3 and the signal to noise ratio per solid angle may be small .",
    "this may be overcome by coupling to a cavity which is tuned to the mode frequency of emission .",
    "in this paper we consider three level cascade systems interacting with two driving fields .",
    "we study the quantum correlations of the radiation emitted by these systems in free space .",
    "in particular , we address three issues :    _ ( i ) quantum state tomography of the two - mode emitted radiation _ : in the far - field approximation ( lowest order in @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and using the weisskopf - wigner theory of spontaneous emission , we show that it is sufficient to measure a set of 8 observables to completely determine the two - photon density matrix .",
    "this is because a @xmath1 - photon state of the emitted radiation in our system is restricted to a hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 instead of the full hilbert space of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , there is an exponential decrease in the number of observables that are needed for tomography . for the present case , @xmath7 , and",
    "the number of required observables is 8 .",
    "an additional feature is that there is a one - one mapping of the atomic and the photonic density matrix and therefore a knowledge of one leads to the other . unlike conventional methods of tomography where",
    "measurements are restricted to the emitted radiation only , in our scheme there is no need to perform the measurements entirely on either the emitted radiation or on the atomic system .",
    "we identify six observables of the atomic system and two observables of the emitted radiation as a convenient set .",
    "thus this approach has an edge over the conventional methods of tomography .    _",
    "( ii ) control and preparation of specific states _ : as already mentioned , it is not easy to prepare entangled systems with a high degree of purity , and with high efficiency .",
    "we show that three level cascade systems provide a very good source of entangled two mode emissions with very large probabilities .",
    "in fact , even in the steady state one has the option of preparing almost pure fiducial states , bell states with reasonable fidelity , or mixed states by suitably setting the driving field strengths and detunings .    _",
    "( iii ) characterization of mixed state entanglement : _ conventional entanglement measures such as concurrence and negativity are known to provide an incomplete description of entanglement in the mixed state regime .",
    "we evaluate the probability density of entanglement for the two - mode state following bhardwaj and ravishankar @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we describe the model , and set up the equation of motion . in section iii",
    "we demonstarte the reconstructibility of the atomic density matrix and also the photon density matrix by a suitable set of measurements . in section",
    "iv we discuss the control of pure / mixed state preparation and the characterization of entanglement .",
    "emission from three level cascade sytems are of interest , especially for the strong quantum correlations that they exhibit .",
    "the earliest classic work of clauser @xcite in cs atoms demonstrated the non - classicality of the emitted radiation in these sytems .",
    "the resonance fluorescence @xcite and the emission statistics @xcite in this system have been well studied and the behavior is qualitatively predictable in most regions of the parameter space . in view of this , and the large number of recent experiments on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in @xmath8 vapours @xcite , we choose to study three level cascade systems . in passing",
    ", we would like to mention that the analysis presented in this paper is equally applicable to @xmath9and @xmath10 systems by properly taking care of the detunings .",
    "the scheme , shown in fig.1 , has only two allowed dipole transitions of energy separations @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponding to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 transitions .",
    "two counter propagating ( doppler free geometry ) driving fields of nearly equal frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 and respective strengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 are resonant with these two transitions .",
    "the decay constants of the energy levels @xmath19 and @xmath20 are indicated by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . the parameters @xmath23 refer to the detunings of the driving fields .",
    "atoms driven by two fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ]      since the input parameters are known  and so is the dynamics ",
    "it is straightforward to solve for the state of the atomic system .",
    "there is , however , no corresponding procedure ( availability of a master equation ) that determines the state of the emitted radiation .",
    "one way is to determine the atom+radiation density matrix , and then trace over the atomic part which is cumbersome . in this paper we will show that this tedious procedure can be circumvented .",
    "we further show that the atomic density matrix determines the photon density matrix completely !",
    "we start by making an ansatz for the atom+field state as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 denotes the atomic index while @xmath26 denotes the photon mode index .",
    "we alternately use the notation @xmath27 .",
    "the notation @xmath28 is more commonly used in quantum information where @xmath29 in base 2 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath30 . in writing the above equation",
    "we make the following assumptions which are central to our analysis : ( i ) the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) which restricts the transitions such that a photon is created only when an atomic excitation is annihilated and vice- versa .",
    "this is very similar to the ansatz of weisskopf -wigner theory of spontaneous emission .",
    "( ii ) the single - photon approximation @xcite - the rise time or the excitation time of the atom is inversely proportional to the driving field strength .",
    "when @xmath31 is small compared to the atomic decay constant @xmath32 , the rise time @xmath33 is large and the atom completes fewer cycles of excitation / de - excitation in an atomic lifetime .",
    "this situation enables us to assume that for small times ( @xmath34 atomic lifetime ) the fock space of the two modes of radiation has at most one photon in each mode .",
    "thus @xmath35 only .",
    "we therefore restrict our study to the situation where the ground state excitation is weak .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture and in the rwa and the dipole approximation has the form @xmath36 here we treat the driving fields classically and @xmath37 , are the rabi frequencies corresponding to the two driving field strengths . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the atomic transition operators .",
    "the equation of motion for the 12 complex amplitudes @xmath40 is then given by @xmath41 it might appear that , in general , the two - photon density matrix elements corresponding to the two modes @xmath42 would require a set of 16 observables for its full determination . however , by employing an equivalent approach in the next section , we show that not all of the complex amplitudes @xmath43 are independent since they are constrained by the production process and selection rules .",
    "we further show that @xmath44 are zero because of rwa .",
    "in general , the field @xmath45 emitted by the atom has the mode expansion @xmath46 for the positive frequency part where @xmath47 for a given mode @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the polarization index .",
    "we now assume that the fields emitted by the two transitions to be dominantly centered around @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively and are defined as in eq(2.12 ) of titulaer and glauber @xcite .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath52=",
    "\\delta_{k , k ' } \\delta_{\\lambda , \\lambda'}$ ] for a given mode @xmath48 .",
    "in order to establish the equivalence of the atomic state with that of the radiation we consider the auxiliary state in the full hilbert space of atom+radiation defined by @xmath53 in the single photon approximation , each mode has either no photons or at most one photon , i.e , @xmath54 .",
    "the indices @xmath55 correspond to the two modes and @xmath56 is the corresponding vacuum .",
    "recall that @xmath57 . also recall that the annihilation operators for the two different modes are mutually commuting at a given time , i.e. , @xmath58= \\delta_{k_1k_2}$ ] and likewise for the creation operators .",
    "the two - photon density matrix may now be obtained by taking a partial trace over the atomic variables to be @xmath59 where the coefficients @xmath60 .",
    "this expression is equivalent to the form that would follow from eq.1 , as may be seen by observing that @xmath61 .",
    "note that this is very similar to the definition of the most general density operator of n photons in a single mode given by eq.2.15 in @xcite .",
    "following the weisskopf - wigner theory of spontaneous emission , we stipulate the far field approximation wherein the field operators @xmath62 of the emitted radiation at the point of the detection @xmath63 are proportional to the atomic spin operators at the retarded time @xmath64 . in the far field for an atom located at @xmath65",
    ", terms proportional to @xmath66 may be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given mode @xmath48 of the source field , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the vacuum field contribution and @xmath69 is the detector efficiency . in this paper",
    "we consider the ideal situation of @xmath70 .",
    "the first term due to the vacuum does not contribute to any signal detection and may be ignored @xcite for detection times larger than the inverse of the optical frequencies .",
    "we use the notation @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for convenience",
    "we replace the mode labels @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary state @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 the atomic operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath78= \\delta_{jk } \\sigma_{il}- \\delta_{li } \\sigma_{kj}$ ] which follow from the identity @xmath79 for the atomic operators @xmath80 .",
    "when the point of observation is the same for both the modes @xmath81 .",
    "therefore @xmath82 again since the atom and photon density matrices are separable at t=0 , the summation term in the r.h.s is nothing but the atomic density matrix .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the geometric factor and @xmath85 .",
    "the normalized density matrices are obtained by dropping @xmath86 .",
    "11 merits some more explanation .",
    "first of all , @xmath87 at any time gets determined completely by @xmath88 , the atomic state at an earlier time @xmath89 .",
    "more interestingly , we observe that @xmath90 is of rank three .",
    "this reduction in the rank is a manifestation of schmidt decomposition as applied to the atom+ radiation system .",
    "more specifically , the dynamics  which leads to the equivalence of the atomic ( retarded time ) and the field operators , yields the following important relations : ( i ) @xmath90 belongs to the space orthogonal to the state @xmath91 .",
    "( ii ) let us set up matrix elements for @xmath90 in the basis @xmath92 .",
    "11 asserts that the matrix in this basis is identically equal to the matrix for the atomic state set up in its standard basis labeled by the energy eigenstates @xmath93 .",
    "explicitly , the normalized photon density matrix has the form    @xmath94    where the subscript @xmath95 emphasizes that the atomic density matrix is evaluated at a retarded time @xmath96 .",
    "the atomic density matrix may be determined by solving the liouville equation    @xmath97 -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2}\\{\\gamma,\\rho\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath98 is the hamiltonian given by eq(2 ) and @xmath32 is the relaxation matrix .",
    "the second term is explicitly given by @xmath99 .",
    "one of the important consequences of the equivalence of the atomic and the photon density matrix , shown in eq .",
    "12 , is that it gives us the freedom of choosing measurements on either the atomic or the photons emitted depending on the practical feasibility .",
    "the existence of more than one complete set of measurements further helps in minimizing uncertainties in the determination of the quantum state .",
    "the complex amplitudes , and hence the density matrix elements , may be determined by making the simple observation @xcite that @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 correspond to the field and atomic variables , @xmath103 are the field operators and @xmath104 corresponds to the identity operator in the atomic space .",
    "we consider all expectation values to be normal ordered in the operators .",
    "this ensures that the spurious contribution of the vacuum is eliminated .",
    "the action of the creation and annihilation field operators on the atom+field states is given below : @xmath105    the expectation value of the annihilation operators @xmath106 of the two modes is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the identity operator of mode @xmath111 of the field .",
    "identifying @xmath112 the expectation values simplify to @xmath113 since the complex amplitudes @xmath114 due to rwa .",
    "the expectation values of the higher order correlation functions , specifically the normal ordered field correlation and the intensity correlation functions which are nonzero , are given by @xmath115    we observe that @xmath116 is the anomalous coherence @xcite or the cross correlation of the amplitudes of the two fields emitted by the atomic system . on the other hand , the expectation value of the pauli operators for the two transitions is listed below : @xmath117     +   +    the expectation values of the normal ordered second and the fourth order spin correlation operators are given by @xmath118 from the above equation we see that @xmath119 @xmath120 and the equivalence between the field operators and the atomic transition operators imply the following set of identities : @xmath121 the first of the conditions is a manifestation of the schmidt decomposition which forces @xmath90 to be of rank three .",
    "note that the atomic operators are related to the amplitudes @xmath122 only while the emitted radiation is related to the amplitudes @xmath123 only . as already mentioned depending on the practical feasibility",
    ", one may choose observables from either the field space or the atomic space .",
    "+   +   +      we now discuss the numerical results in three regimes of interest : a ) the pure state regime @xmath124 , b ) the bell state regime , @xmath125 and c ) the mixed state regime @xmath126 .",
    "the reason for this nomenclature becomes clear in our analysis below .",
    "all the system parameters may be rendered dimensionless by scaling with the atomic lifetime @xmath127 .",
    "in particular we choose the pure state regime corresponding to the driving field strengths @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "our numerical simulations correspond to the two - photon resonant situation ; therefore , @xmath130 .",
    "the upper most level @xmath131 ( which may correspond to @xmath132 is assumed to be metastable , i.e. , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we further assume the system to be closed .",
    "fig.2 shows the populations in the @xmath135 , @xmath136 and the @xmath137 of the two photon state as functions of time .",
    "we have studied the time dependence of the populations in the three regimes mentioned above .",
    "fig.2a corresponds to the pure state regime wherein the population is negligible in @xmath138 and is mostly in @xmath135 with a relatively small admixture of @xmath137 .",
    "indeed it is clear from the graph that the purity , @xmath139 , is quite close to one .",
    "the bell state regime corresponds to @xmath140 and is illustrated in fig.2b . here ,",
    "the level @xmath141 starts getting populated but remains small compared to the populations in @xmath135 and the @xmath142 states which become comparable to each other .",
    "the coherence between @xmath143 and @xmath144 is also quite large . in the mixed state regime ( @xmath145 )",
    "shown in fig.2c , we note that all the populations are comparable and the purity is much less than one .",
    "note that the time evolution in all the regimes attains steady state in approximately an atomic lifetime after performing one rabi cycle .",
    "this justifies the single photon approximation approach @xcite used here .",
    "the steady state two - photon density matrix corresponding to the three regimes is shown in figs.3a-3f .",
    "the real part of the density matrix in the pure , the bell and the mixed state regimes are respectively shown in figs.3a , 3c and 3e .",
    "likewise the imaginary part of the density matrix in the three regimes are shown in fig.3b , 3d and 3f .",
    "note that the third column and the third row are zero everywhere , as implied by schmidt decomposition and the dynamics . in the pure state regime ( figs.3a , 3b ) , even though most of the population is in the ground state there is a nonzero population in the @xmath137 state and a nonzero correlation in the @xmath146 element .",
    "this is an almost pure state as is clear from fig.2a ( @xmath147 ) and the pure state component is of the form @xmath148 .",
    "the small mixedness is due to the nonzero population in the @xmath141 state . in the bell state regime ( figs.3c , 3d ) , the correlation is strong and further the populations in the @xmath135 and @xmath137 are equal .",
    "the loss of purity is again due to the @xmath141 state . in the mixed state regime ( figs.3e,3f ) , the steady populations in the three levels are comparable , and the correlations @xmath149 and @xmath150 compete with the correlation @xmath151 .",
    "this regime provides the most general two photon mixed state .",
    "having determined the state of the two - photon density matrix we now move on to study the entanglement properties of the two - mode emitted radiation .",
    "pure state entanglement may be characterized by various measures such as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , concurrence and negativity .",
    "all these measures are equivalent in the sense that they are relative monotones with respect to each other . in contrast",
    ", it is well known that the entanglement of a mixed state ( mse ) can not be characterized by a single parameter @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the above mentioned pure state measures in terms of a single parameter cease to be relative monotones of each other in the mixed state regime ; this has been demonstrated explicitly in the case of concurrence and negativity @xcite . in a detailed and exhaustive analysis , peters et .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the sensitivity of the state to a number of measures of entanglement for depolarized nonmaximally entangled states such as the werner states and also the so called maximally entangled mixed states .",
    "they perform a relative comparison of six benchmarks of entanglement _ viz .",
    "_ , fidelity , trace distance , tangle , linear entropy , concurrence and von neumann entropy , and find an imbalance in the values of these quantities , even in situations where it is not expected , clearly signalling that none of these can by itself fully account for mse . finally , we mention quantum discord @xcite which again displays the tension between such definitions of entanglement",
    ".    we would like to point out here that the description of mixed state entanglement by bhardwaj and ravishankar @xcite addresses these issues by characterizing mse in terms of a probability density function ( pdf ) rather than a single number .",
    "this characterization does not invoke any new concept such as entanglement of formation or separability .",
    "instead , it is based on the observation that a description in terms of mixed states is required when we have an ensemble of quantum systems each of which is in a pure state .",
    "a probabilistic description is , therefore , natural .",
    "this expectation is vindicated by the fact that while two states which are not equivalent under local operations ( @xmath152 ) can have the same value for concurrence , the probability densities are necessarily distinct .",
    "in fact , the state can be reconstructed almost uniquely ( up to local transformations ) by the density .",
    "we employ this characterization of mse in this paper .",
    "we briefly describe their formalism :      the characterization of mixed state is accomplished in two steps .",
    "firstly , the special case when the state is a projection of rank @xmath153 is considered ( for a two qubit system , @xmath154 ) , @xmath155 , where the operator @xmath156 projects a @xmath153 dimensional subspace @xmath157 of the two qubit hilbert space @xmath158 .",
    "we then observe that for all @xmath159 , which means that there is a uniform probability for the system to be in any state in the subspace @xmath160 . by the same token , for all states @xmath161 , implying that the probability for finding the system in the complementary subspace vanishes identically .",
    "armed with this simple basis independent observation , define the probability density function @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the volume measure for the manifold @xmath157 .",
    "to repeat , the density so obtained is not an artifact of any expansion of @xmath164 .",
    "we mention that the state may be reconstructed from the resultant pdf , which is unique  up to local transformations .",
    "in the case when @xmath164 is not a projection , it is written as a weighted sum of projection operators @xmath156 , satisfying the nestedness condition @xmath165 .",
    "consider the expansion of @xmath164 in its eigenbasis with its eigenvalues written in a non - increasing order , then , @xmath166 with the restriction that @xmath167 . employing this resolution , the pdf for any state can be written as @xmath168 the pdf so defined is invariant under @xmath169 transformations .",
    "it has been shown by bhardwaj and ravishankar that it requires seven independent parameters which characterize the pdf in various subspaces as follows : @xmath170 recall that @xmath171 is the projection onto the @xmath153 dimensional subspace . in what follows , for pure state entanglement",
    ", we shall employ the pure state concurrence , @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the time reversed state of @xmath174 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ two dimensional projections _",
    "@xmath176 : the evaluation of pdf for a two dimensional space involves two parameters and is somewhat involved , given its rich structure .",

    ", one can infer from fig.3a that the state must be a superposition of the @xmath135 and @xmath137 states with an excess of population in the @xmath135 state .",
    "this is further substantiated by the strong correlation as shown by the @xmath151 element .",
    "the deviation from purity is due to the unequal populations in the @xmath143 and the @xmath137 state .",
    "the two and three dimensional contributions are negligibly small in this case . in the bell state regime ,",
    "fig.5b , there is a dominant contribution from the pure state even though the probability decreases to @xmath228 .",
    "note however , that the state in this regime is closer to a bell state since @xmath195 is close to one .",
    "there is a small contribution from the three dimensional subspace . in the mixed state regime fig.5c",
    "there is a comparable contribution from all the subspaces .",
    "the pure state probability has however reduced to less than @xmath229 and also @xmath230 .",
    "the nature of mixedness in this regime may be understood by looking at fig.3c and fig.5c .",
    "even though the populations in @xmath135 and @xmath137 are nearly equal , the correlation @xmath151 is much weaker . on the other hand",
    "the correlation @xmath231 is stronger implying that the superposition of the @xmath135 and @xmath141 is competing . since both the correlations are comparable the states belong to either two or three dimensional subspace .",
    "the equivalence of the photon and atom density matrix suggests that the correlation @xmath232 is proportional to the atomic coherence @xmath233 .",
    "note that maximum entanglement of the two photon occurs when this correlation and hence the atomic coherence is strong .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the fact that the quantum correlations of the atomic system manifest as strong correlations in the emitted radiation as well . in the mixed state regime",
    "the single and two photon coherences compete and results in a weaker entanglement of the two photons .",
    "thus the control of entanglement / purity is achieved by controlling the atomic coherences .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to determine the two photon density matrix , in its fock space , by a combination of observations that include measurements on the atomic system that generate the photons and the radiation itself . by a proper choice of the two driving field strengths , the radiation emitted",
    "can either be prepared as a pure state , but with little entanglement , or with a reasonable overlap with the bell state , but with some mixedness .",
    "both the regimes are of interest .",
    "the former is eminently suited for the preparation of fiducial states as in applications such as the deutsch algorithm .",
    "the latter regime , where highly entangled states are produced is useful when initial entanglement is required , as in the case of teleportation .",
    "the third regime , where @xmath234 seems unsuited for applications ; on the other hand , it provides mixed states exhibiting a rich variety of entanglement which can not be captured in terms of a simple parameter .",
    "it should be of interest to extend this study to multi photon production and its characterization in terms of purity and entanglement .",
