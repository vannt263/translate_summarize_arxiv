    "the rauzy gasket ( see fig.[rg ] ) was described for the first time by g. levitt in 1993 in @xcite and was associated with the simplest example of pseudogroups of rotations .",
    "later the same set was described by i. dynnikov and r. de leo ( see @xcite ) as a subset of chaotic regimes for a very particular case of novikov s problem ( @xcite ) of plane sections of triply periodic surface . in @xcite independently p. arnoux and s. starosta reintroduced this object as a subset of standard 2-dimensional simplex associated with letter frequencies of ternary episturmian words .",
    "the name rauzy gasket was used for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the same fractal appears in connection with systems of isometries of thin type that are described by 2 independent parameters .",
    "detailed description of the last approach is provided in the next section . in all these cases",
    ", the rauzy gasket plays the role of a parameter space endowed with a dynamics by piecewise projective maps .",
    "it was proved by levitt and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz in @xcite , arnoux and starosta in @xcite and by dynnikov and de leo ( @xcite ) by different techniques that this set has a zero lebesgue measure ( see , in particular , @xcite for the main approach used by arnoux and starosta to prove their result ) .    hausdorff dimension of the rauzy gasket was estimated numerically in @xcite ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 were suggested as bounds ) .",
    "however , there were no theoretical estimations .",
    "arnoux asked whether this hausdorff dimension is less than 2 or equal to 2 ( see also @xcite for other interesting open questions ) . the same problem but for much more general situation was posed by a. maltsev and s.p .",
    "novikov in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove :    [ thm : main ] the hausdorff dimension of the rauzy gasket is less than 2 .    * remark 1 * : our statement also proves the conjecture about hausdorff dimension of the set of chaotic regimes formulated by a. maltsev and s.p .",
    "novikov that we mentioned above for a very particular surface .",
    "this result follows directly from our theorem and the construction in @xcite .",
    "* remark 2 * : an upper bound can be deduced from the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] but it would be very bad .",
    "* remark 3 * : our result also can be generalized for the estimation of the hausdorff dimension of the rauzy gasket of any dimension @xmath2 ( see @xcite and @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is just exactly the same .",
    "we first , recall the definition of rauzy induction for systems of isometries introduced by dynnikov .",
    "we study its combinatorical properties in our special case .",
    "note that the rauzy gasket appears as a result of application of the projectivization of the rauzy induction to original parameter space .",
    "in particular , we check that the rauzy graph is connected .",
    "then , we associate a cocycle with our rauzy induction procedure and make some distortion estimations ( see appendix a in @xcite and theorem 4.2 in @xcite ) . using these estimations , we prove that the roof function has exponential tail ( the idea of the proof comes from theorem 4.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "this property allows us to check the fast decaying property for the projective map that determines the rauzy gasket ( see @xcite for exact definition ) .",
    "finally , based on bounded distortion and fast decaying properties , we obtain an upper bound for hausdorff dimension of our fractal , as a corollary from theorem 26 in @xcite .      we heartily thank p. arnoux who gave inspiring talks on the rauzy gasket and asked the question to the authors .",
    "we thank a. bufetov for interesting discussions on distorsion estimates obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also thank v. delecroix for useful explanations of the paper @xcite and i. dynnikov for several improvements of the first version of the paper .",

    "such systems can be used to construct 3-periodic central symmetric surfaces in the three space whose intersections with plane of fixed direction has a chaotic behavior .",

    "the rauzy induction for systems of isometries was introduced by dynnikov in @xcite .    _",

    "this means in particular that our system has points with finite orbits .",
    "the rauzy induction stops once a system with a hole obtained .",
    "one can check that system of isometries of thin type is exactly such a system for which the rauzy induction can be applied for infinite number of times , and hole is never obtained . comparing formulas for the rauzy induction with maps that appear in @xcite in description of the rauzy gasket as iterated function system , it is easy to see that set of parameters @xmath64 such that correposnding special system of isometries is of thin type is exactly the rauzy gasket .",
    "let @xmath65 we will enumerate 3 subintervals ( from the biggest to the smallest ) and check what happens with them during the rauzy induction . taking into consideration that intervals are always ordered in accordance with the definition of the special systems of isometries , we will sometimes need to change this enumeration after the step of the rauzy induction .",
    "configuration will be coded by permutations ( say , @xmath66 ) .",
    "so , like in case of interval exchange transformations , for each special system of isometries we assocciate data of two types : collection of three lengths ( @xmath67 ) and combinatorial data that informs us how to order our subintervals with their new lengths in compare with the order of original subintervals .",
    "thus , the parameter space @xmath68 with the normalizing restriction @xmath69    one step of the rauzy induction can be coded by one of the following data collection ( we use expression of old length of subintervals in terms of new one ) :    * matrix @xmath70 permutation @xmath71 ; * matrix @xmath72 permutation @xmath73 ; * matrix @xmath74 permutation @xmath75    one can construct an _ accelerated _ version of the rauzy induction .",
    "we define a _ generalized iteration _ of the rauzy induction by analogy with a step of the fast version of euclid s algorithm , which involves the division with remainder instead of subtraction of the smaller number from the larger .",
    "it may happen that only one of the three pairs of intervals is subject to reduction in several consecutive steps of the rauzy induction ( and the intervals from the second and the third pair are involved only in transmissions ) .",
    "another words , it means that there is one winner for several consecutive steps of the algorithm . in this case",
    "we consider the result of such a sequence of the rauzy induction iterations as the result of applying of one generalized iteration .",
    "this kind of acceleration for interval exchange transformations was described by a. zorich in @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 - matrix of the accelerated rauzy induction is the following : @xmath76 or @xmath77 where @xmath6 is a counter of simple rauzy inductions included in one generalized iteration .      like in a case of interval exchange transformations , we consider _ the rauzy graph _ used for description of combinatorial part of the rauzy induction ( here we use a non - accelerated version of the algorithm ) .",
    "vertices of this graph are all permutations of 3 elements , and 2 vertices are connected by arrow if and only if one permutation appears as a result of application of the rauzy induction to some system of isometry combinatorial part of which is described by the second permutation . for example , looking at description of simple step of the rauzy induction , we see that @xmath78 but there is no arrow between @xmath71 and @xmath79 we have the following obvious    rauzy graph is connected , but one of the vertices corresponds to the hole .    for future constructions",
    "we will also need one additional definitions :    path @xmath80 in the rauzy graph is called _ complete _ if every @xmath81 is a winner of some arrow composing @xmath80 .      with each special systems of isometries",
    "we can associate foliated 2-complex @xmath82 ( we call it _ band complex _ , using terminology from @xmath5-trees theory )",
    ". start with the disjoint union of the support interval ( foliated by points ) and strips @xmath83 $ ] ( foliated by @xmath84 $ ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath82 by glueing @xmath83 $ ] the to @xmath4 , identifying each @xmath85 with @xmath86 and each @xmath87 with @xmath88 . we will identify @xmath4 with its image in @xmath82 .",
    "cocycle is responsible for things that happen with vertical lengths of bands during the application of the rauzy induction .",
    "let @xmath51 be a matrix of the cocycle .",
    "for any intermediate steps that are included in acceleration @xmath51 is the following : @xmath89    @xmath90 corresponds to way @xmath80 in the rauzy graph .",
    "the space for our flow ( let us denote it by @xmath91 ) is a direct product of the parameter space for the induction @xmath92 and @xmath93 with a normalizing restriction that sum of total area of 3 bands is equal to 1 .",
    "path @xmath80 in the rauzy graph is called _ positive _ , if @xmath90 is done by matrix with strictly positive entries .",
    "any complete path is positive .",
    "we start from identity matrix of the cocycle .",
    "the fact that @xmath94 is a winner in terms of cocycle matrix means that row with number @xmath94 is added to 2 other rows ( here we always mention original enumeration and do not care about permutations ) . if path is complete , than each row was added to two others at least once , so all zeros disappear .    * remark * : each positive path is strongly positive in a sense of @xcite and @xcite , because in comparing with the case of interval exchange transformation the suspension construction for the systems of isometries has one significant difference : there is no difference between the past and the future for the orbits of the system , and so there is no orientation for the leaves of the vertical bands .",
    "therefore the condition required for path to be strongly positive is satisfied in our case automatically .",
    "one can check that considering a projective version of the rauzy maps , we obtain a markov partition @xmath95 of the original simplex @xmath96 ( some of our cells correspond to holes ) , and moreover this markov partition is a partition of so called _ john domain _ ( see @xcite for exact definition , we do not use any special properties of john domain here ) . let us denote by @xmath97 a projectivization of the rauzy induction map : @xmath98 .",
    "we will need one more definition :    let @xmath99 be a finite or countable set , let @xmath96 be a john domain , and let @xmath100 be a partition into open sets of a full measure subset of @xmath101 a map @xmath98 is a _ uniformly expanding _",

    "* remark : * : this property is already mentioned in @xcite but we provide a direct proof .",
    "we consider an accelerated version of the rauzy induction .",
    "projective map @xmath97 that corresponds to the matrix @xmath37 is the following : @xmath115 @xmath116 then , @xmath117 simplex @xmath118 has the following vertices : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 so , on the one hand , @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    ". therefore , @xmath124    on the other hand , @xmath125 so @xmath126 it proves the first condition .",
    "the second condition is equivalent to the following one : @xmath127 in our case : @xmath128 where @xmath129 @xmath130 due to inequalities for @xmath131 for current markov cell one can conclude that @xmath132 it means that @xmath133 satisfied the following inequalities : @xmath134 so , @xmath135 now we consider @xmath136 @xmath137 so , we proved the second condition with @xmath138    * remark : * the conclusion about zero measure can be deduced from this property like in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the rauzy graph ( note that it is simply connected ) and some path @xmath80 defined on the graph . let us denote by @xmath66 the start of this path , @xmath94 is the winner and @xmath139 is the loser ; @xmath140 is the matrix of the cocycle corresponding to this path",
    ". we will be interested in the measure of the following part of the domain simplex : @xmath141 studying distortion questions , we will mainly use a measure @xmath142 on a projective space @xmath143 instead of a usual lebesgue measure : @xmath144 in particular , it means that @xmath145 then @xmath146 more generally , for @xmath147 and @xmath148 let @xmath149 let also @xmath150 then @xmath151      while we make steps of rauzy induction , we have the following situation : norm of the first column of the cocycle matrix increases , while norms of 2 other matrices remain stable . in order",
    "to estimate distortion we have to check that the probability of the event that the ratio between these two norms will become too big is quite small .",
    "note that after the last ordinary step of the rauzy induction all 3 norms will become comparable again , and this situation is not dangerous for us .",
    "so , we have to concentrate on some intermediate step .    for any @xmath152 @xmath153    we fix @xmath80 - it",
    "is a path such that we stay at one vertex , say , 1,2,3 , for time @xmath6 ( here we measure time in terms of ordinary iterations of the rauzy induction ) .",
    "so , @xmath154 it is easy to see that the norm of the first component remains stable while two other norms increase ( as a norm we mean here the value of maximal element ) .",
    "so , we use approach suggested by kerkchoff in @xcite for the corresponding matrix of the rauzy induction .",
    "let us denote the columns of this matrix by @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "then norm of @xmath156 and @xmath157 during the rauzy induction increase while norm of @xmath158 remains stable .",
    "more precise , image of the original parameter space will be written in the following way : @xmath159 one can check that @xmath160 where @xmath161 means a value after @xmath6 iterations and @xmath162 because we stay at one vertex of rauzy graph . in accordance with lemma conditions , we have the following : @xmath163 so @xmath164 the same inequality holds for @xmath157 because at the beginning we had a balanced vector .",
    "now we are going to estimate the measure of corresponding part in the original parameter space : @xmath165      let us introduce the following notations : @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169    there exists @xmath170 such that @xmath171 @xmath172    we use the strategy of proof of theorem a.2 in @xcite",
    ".    in our case dimension is equal to 3 , so we have to consider two types of subsets @xmath173 of @xmath174 : with cardinality 1 or 2 , and then use induction on dimension of @xmath173",
    ". we will provide the whole procedure for the step from @xmath175 to @xmath176 ; the next step is similar .",
    "so , our main goal is to prove the following statement for @xmath176 : @xmath177 * base of the induction * : for k=1 the statement is obvious because @xmath178 and we can use previous lemma .    * step of the induction * : we consider @xmath179 - set of paths starting at our permutation @xmath66 such that there exists @xmath180 for any @xmath181 @xmath182 .",
    "the last condition just means that @xmath183    therefore , due to previous lemma , there exist @xmath184 and @xmath173 with cardinality 1 ( we can suggest without any serious restrictions that @xmath185 ) such that @xmath186 and for any @xmath187 @xmath188    let us continue the path from @xmath189 up to the moment , when something will happen with the second subinterval ( that s what we do in acceleration ) . more precisely , we fix @xmath190 and consider @xmath191 with minimal length where at the end of @xmath192 the corresponding permutation starts from 2 , not from 1 .",
    "these @xmath193 comprise a set @xmath194 .",
    "so , for some @xmath195 @xmath196 and @xmath197 the last statement follows from the fact that for accelerated iteration the corresponding vector is balanced : the norm of @xmath198 should be compared with the norm of @xmath199 and @xmath200 is a coefficient of this comparison .",
    "now we construct @xmath201 that contains @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 is such that all arrows contain @xmath61 or @xmath59 as the winners except the last one ( so , at the end we obtain a permutation starting with 1 again ) and @xmath205 ( note that it is a requirement , it does not for any arbitrary path with this construction ) .",
    "let us check what does it mean in terms of rauzy induction .",
    "let us denote by @xmath17 number of steps when @xmath61 was a winner , and by @xmath18 - number of steps where @xmath59 was a winner .",
    "so , we have the following matrix : @xmath206 we deal with a norm of corresponding rows .",
    "our restriction means that @xmath207 we checked it in order to verify that we still live in a set of some positive measure , and also will use it later .",
    "now we apply previous lemma to the set @xmath201 : @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "so , we are ready to construct @xmath210 - the set of paths for which theorem condition holds . if @xmath211 , then we consider a minimal path @xmath212 between @xmath213 and @xmath193 for which we have the same . for this @xmath212",
    "we can check directly , using our previous calculations , that for @xmath94 equals to 2 or 3 @xmath214 ( it follows from the estimation on @xmath17 and @xmath18 that we obtained before ) .",

    "consists of several iterations with the same winner ( for instance , 1 ) and then one iteration with the different winner ( 2 or 3 ) .",

    "now we consider a subset @xmath249 of this set @xmath189 consisting of all @xmath247 such that @xmath250 where @xmath173 is a proper set of @xmath174 ( the last property means that @xmath251 ) .    by the previous lemma we have that @xmath252 with some constant @xmath253",
    "now we use the strategy from @xcite : we fix some permutation @xmath254 from the rauzy class ( which is the only one because our rauzy graph is connected ) and consider a path @xmath255 that will be a shortest path starting at @xmath254 and containing @xmath237 as a second part : @xmath256 then , if @xmath243 is large enough , we can suggest that @xmath257 if this @xmath254(that still was arbitrary ) is the end of @xmath258 , then @xmath259 because @xmath80 does not contain @xmath237 as a part ( it is a condition of the lemma ) .    if @xmath260 , the last probability can be estimated directly in terms of subsimplexes of original simplex : if @xmath261 then @xmath262 because @xmath263 if @xmath190 and , on the other hand , @xmath264 that , together with [ b ] , gives us estimation for the denominator .",
    "now , if @xmath265 then @xmath266    @xmath267 if @xmath268 then @xmath269    so , we can take @xmath270 in lemma conditions .",
    "[ thm : proba - estimate ] for every @xmath237 there exist @xmath271 such that for every @xmath272 and every @xmath273    @xmath240 can not be written as @xmath241 and @xmath274    let us use @xmath275 and @xmath276 from previous lemma and fix @xmath277 to be minimal such that @xmath278 .",
    "let @xmath80 to be a minimal path that does not contain @xmath237 as his part and @xmath279 .",
    "then @xmath80 can be considered as a composition of @xmath280 where @xmath281 and @xmath282 is minimal with htis property .",
    "sets of corresponding @xmath283 are disjoint due to minimality .",
    "we can estimate the following probability using previous lemma : @xmath284 so @xmath285 .",
    "the result follows from the definition of @xmath277 .",
    "with this construction we mainly follow the idea descibed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our principal purpose is to prove that the first return map to the small precompact sections has some distortion properties .",
    "first , we provide some details of the construction .",
    "let us consider positive complete path @xmath286 starting and ending at the same permutation @xmath66 and a subsimplex of the parameter space that corresponds to this path @xmath287 .",
    "the connected components of the domain of this map are given by the @xmath288 where @xmath289 or @xmath290 but not beginning from @xmath291 since we want to deal with the first return map .",
    "roof function is a return time to this connected component corresponding to simplex @xmath287 : @xmath292 where @xmath293 is a vector of lengths and @xmath66 is a corresponding permutation .",
    "our map is restricted to such a component in the following way : @xmath294 where @xmath295    * remark : * since the path is positive we consider the first return time to the precompact section , like in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now we can consider our flow as a suspension flow over map @xmath97 and the roof function @xmath296 .",
    "but with such a restriction that we deal only with the small precompact sections and orbits that return back to this subsimplex we lose control on all other orbits that never go back .",
    "however , this can be fixed by the following lemma :    almost every minimal orbit is captured by suspension model .",
    "* remark : * orbits that arrive at some point to a hole do not play a role for the roof function estimations since the map can be supposed identical inside of all the holes .",
    "this property follows from the fact that minimal orbits ( and then the corresponding flow ) are ergodic with respect to lebegue measure that is true in our case since the map @xmath97 is uniformly expanding ( see , for example , mae @xcite for the statement of a folklore theorem about the existence of ergodic and invariant absolutely continuous probability measure for the uniformly expanding maps on markov partitions ) .",
    "a function @xmath296 has an _ exponential tails _ if there exists @xmath297 such that @xmath298    the roof function has exponential tails .",
    "the proof can be adapted from analogous statements in @xcite or in @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "it is a consequence of theorem [ thm : proba - estimate ] .",
    "informally , following what happens for interval exchange transformations @xmath299 is the `` teichmller '' time needed to renormalize our interval to length 1 . then",
    "time is divided into pieces of exponential size . for each piece , we apply theorem [ thm : proba - estimate ] .    indeed , we consider measure @xmath300 that we used in section 3 for the distortion estimation with @xmath301 it was a measure in the parameter space of the induction .",
    "so , the pushforward of this measure under radial projection yields a smooth function on the parameter space of the flow , say , @xmath302 for the theorem statement it is enough to show that @xmath303 for some @xmath304 and some @xmath305    a connected component of the domain of the markov map @xmath306 that intersects the set @xmath307 is of the form @xmath308 but with some restriction on @xmath80 ( it can not be a concatenation of more than three copies of @xmath286 because we always wait for only for the first return ) and with a condition @xmath309 where @xmath304 is some constant depending on @xmath286 ( it follows directly from the definition of the roof function ) .",
    "now by previous proposition we can conclude the statement of the theorem since the measure can be estimated in terms of probabilities of corresponding events : @xmath310 does not contain some @xmath311 as a proper set and @xmath312",
    "let @xmath96 be a john domain and @xmath313 is a markov map .",
    "we will denote the corresponding markov partition by @xmath314 .",
    "let us consider @xmath315 where all @xmath316 are integers ; by @xmath317 we denote @xmath318 such that @xmath319 for all @xmath320 we say that @xmath6 is a _",
    "depth _ of the partition done by @xmath317 .",
    "first , let us prove that @xmath323 where @xmath324 indeed , let us consider some intermediate step of the accelerated version of the rauzy induction and related cocycle .",
    "so , @xmath325 then ( up to the order of rows ) @xmath326 and @xmath327 from lemma 3 we already know that @xmath328 now , implication of the lemma follows from this statement and the fact that measure of subsimplexes is proportional to @xmath329 .      assume that @xmath97 is fast decaying .",
    "for @xmath330 , let @xmath331 be a union of some subsimplices ( @xmath332 of depth @xmath6 and let @xmath333 let @xmath334 then @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the fast decay constant .    in order to deduce theorem [ thm : main ] from this theorem",
    "we just need to check that @xmath337 > 0 .",
    "it follows directly from the fact that size of simplexes of the partition decreases exponentially fast because map @xmath97 is uniformly expanding ( see @xcite for details ) . the same statement can be deduced from the probability estimations made in previous section .",
    "this ends the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
