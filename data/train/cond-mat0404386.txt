    "the evaluation of the transport coefficients from the boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) is quite involved .",
    "in fact , to get explicit results one usually considers the leading order in a sonine polynomial expansion of the velocity distribution function .",
    "these difficulties increase when one considers multicomponent systems since not only the number of transport coefficients is larger than for a single gas but they are also functions of more parameters such as composition , masses , sizes , and the coefficients of restitution . as in the elastic case , a possible way to partially overcome these problems",
    "is to consider other interaction models that simplify the complex mathematical structure of the boltzmann collision integrals for ihs .",
    "for this reason , the so - called inelastic maxwell models ( imm ) have been widely used in the past few years as a toy model to characterize the influence of the inelasticity of collisions on the physical properties of granular fluids . the imm share with elastic maxwell molecules the property that the collision rate is velocity independent but , on the other hand , their collision rules are the same as for ihs . in this sense , although these imm do not correspond to any microscopic potential interaction , it has been shown by several authors @xcite that the cost of sacrificing physical realism is in part compensated by the amount of exact analytical results .",
    "most of the studies carried out by considering imm have been devoted to homogeneous states , especially in the analysis of the overpopulated high energy tails .",
    "@xcite however , much less is known in the case of _ inhomogeneous _ situations and , more specifically , on the dependence of the transport coefficients on dissipation . for a monocomponent granular gas subjected to simple shear flow , the imm",
    "have been used to calculate the rheological properties ( shear and normal stresses ) in three dimensions .",
    "@xcite more recently , this study has been extended @xcite to multicomponent systems , the exact results of imm showing a close agreement with those obtained analytically for ihs in the first sonine approximation @xcite and by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite all these results are restricted to steady shear flow problems without any limitation on the strength of the shear rate . for general inhomogeneous problems and in the case of a monocomponent gas , the boltzmann equation for imm has been solved @xcite from the chapman - enskog method @xcite for states near the ( local ) homogeneous cooling state .",
    "explicit expressions of the navier - stokes transport coefficients of imm in @xmath0 dimensions have been obtained for unforced systems as well as for systems driven by thermostats .",
    "in contrast to the findings of ref .  , the comparison with the transport coefficients of ihs @xcite shows that their dependence on inelasticity is captured by the imm only in a mild qualitative way .",
    "this fact stimulates the determination of the exact expressions of the transport coefficients for inelastic granular mixtures .",
    "the goal of this paper is to derive the hydrodynamic equations for a @xmath0-dimensional binary mixture of inelastic maxwell gases at low - density . as in the single gas case ,",
    "normal _ solution to the coupled set of boltzmann equations for the two species is obtained by using the standard chapman - enskog method @xcite conveniently generalized to inelastic collisions . in the first order of the spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields , we get the corresponding navier - stokes hydrodynamic equations with explicit expressions for the relevant transport coefficients of the mixture . for molecular fluid mixtures , the specific set of gradients contributing to each flux",
    "is restricted by fluid symmetry , time reversal invariance ( onsager relations ) , and the form of entropy production .",
    "@xcite however , in the case of inelastic collisions , only fluid symmetry holds and so there is more flexibility in representing the fluxes and identifying the corresponding transport coefficients . in the case of the pressure tensor ,",
    "fluid symmetry considerations implies that its form to first order in the gradients is the same as for the monocomponent gas . in the case of mass and heat fluxes , several different ( but equivalent ) choices of hydrodynamic fields",
    "can be used and some care must be taken when comparing transport coefficients coming from different representations . as in the case of ihs,@xcite",
    "we take the gradients of the mole fraction , the ( hydrostatic ) pressure , the temperature , and the flow velocity as the relevant ones . as a consequence , in this representation",
    "there are seven independent scalar transport coefficients : the mutual diffusion , the pressure diffusion and the thermal diffusion associated with the mass flux , the shear viscosity corresponding to the pressure tensor and the dufour coefficient , the thermal conductivity , and the pressure energy coefficient associated with the heat flux .",
    "all these coefficients are given in terms of the coefficients of restitution as well as on the ratios of concentration , masses and particle sizes .",
    "in addition , as in the previous study for ihs , @xcite our theory takes into account the effect of temperature differences ( failure of energy equipartition ) on the transport coefficients , leading to additional dependencies of them on the concentration .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the boltzmann equation for imm and the macroscopic conservation laws are introduced .",
    "the model includes average collision frequencies @xmath1 which can be freely fitted to get good agreement with ihs .",
    "here , we fix @xmath1 by the criterion that the cooling rates @xmath2 of imm be the same as those obtained for ihs in the local equilibrium approximation . the homogenous solution of the boltzmann equation is analyzed in section [ sec3 ] , where the temperature ratio and the fourth cumulant ( kurtosis ) of the velocity distribution functions are exactly obtained .",
    "comparison with the results obtained for ihs @xcite shows an excellent agreement for the temperature ratio but significant discrepancies with the fourth cumulant of ihs .",
    "section [ sec4 ] deals with the application of the chapman - enskog method to get the transport coefficients of imm . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "the dependence of some of these coefficients on the parameters of the system is illustrated and compared with known results derived for ihs .",
    "@xcite the comparison shows in general a qualitative good agreement , especially for the transport coefficients defining the mass flux .",
    "the paper ends in section [ sec6 ] with a brief discussion on the results reported in this paper .",
    "let us consider a binary mixture of inelastic maxwell gases at low density .",
    "the boltzmann equation for imm @xcite can be obtained from the boltzmann equation for ihs by replacing the rate for collisions between particles of species @xmath3 and @xmath4 by an average velocity - independent collision rate , which is proportional to the square root of the `` granular '' temperature @xmath5 .",

    "in addition , the primes on the velocities denote the initial values @xmath15 that lead to @xmath16 following a binary collision : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative velocity of the colliding pair , @xmath19 is a unit vector directed along the centers of the two colliding spheres , and @xmath20 . the collision frequencies @xmath1 can be seen as free parameters in the model .",
    "its dependence on the restitution coefficients @xmath21 can be chosen to optimize the agreement with the results obtained from the boltzmann equation for ihs .",
    "of course , the choice is not unique and may depend on the property of interest .",
    "there is another more refined version of the inelastic maxwell model @xcite where the collision rate has the same dependence on the scalar product ( @xmath22 ) as in the case of hard spheres .",
    "however , both versions of imm lead to similar results in problems as delicate as the high energy tails.@xcite therefore , for the sake of simplicity , here we will consider the version given by eqs .",

    "the balance equations ( [ 2.9])([2.11 ] ) apply regardless of the details of the model for inelastic collisions considered .",
    "however , the influence of the collision model appears through the dependence of the cooling rate and the hydrodynamic fluxes on the coefficients of restitution .    as happens for elastic collisions,@xcite",
    "the main advantage of using imm is that a velocity moment of order @xmath49 of the boltzmann collision operator only involves moments of order less than or equal to @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite this allows one to determine the boltzmann collisional moments without the explicit knowledge of the velocity distribution function .",
