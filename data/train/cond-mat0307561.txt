    "the static structure of a simple fluid is commonly described in terms of the @xmath2-body distribution functions @xmath3 , measuring the probability densities of finding two , three , and more particles at specified positions in space .",
    "the present paper is concerned with three - body distribution functions , as obtained from measured configurations in two - dimensional colloidal model fluids .",
    "there are many examples in statistical mechanics where triplet correlations in classical fluids are important .",
    "they play an essential role , for example , in earlier theories of the pair correlation function of a fluid , such as the born - green - yvon integral equation theory , which explicitly shows the relationsship between pair and triplet correlation functions @xcite .",
    "triplet correlations are furthermore used in perturbation theories for static fluid properties @xcite , in theories of transport properties @xcite , but also to describe solvent reorganization processes around solutes @xcite or systems under shear - flow @xcite . and ,",
    "finally , one is again led to triplet correlation functions if one is interested in the temperature or density derivative of the pair - correlation function @xmath4 @xcite .    for these and other reasons ,",
    "it is not surprising to see how often triplet correlations have been theoretically investigated , in the overwhelming number of cases , by computer simulation studies .",
    "of central importance in these studies is kirkwood s idea @xcite to approximate the triplet distribution function by three different pair distribution functions ( the kirkwood superposition approximation ( ksa ) explained in more detail below ) .",
    "the reliability and quality of the ksa has been tested extensively for pure hard - sphere systems @xcite , for lennard - jones ( lj ) fluids @xcite , for liquid sodium @xcite , but also for yukawa fluids @xcite , with the general result that all qualitative features of @xmath5 are usually well described by the ksa . however , quantitative differences at small distances and high densities can be appreciable , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "mc neil et al .",
    "@xcite compared their simulations also with analytical theories going beyond the ksa .",
    "more recent simulations aiming at an understanding of higher - order correlations are performed in 2-component asymmetric electrolyte @xcite , in an aqueous 1:1 electrolyte @xcite , and in strong 3:3 and 1:3 electrolytes @xcite .",
    "finally , one has to mention theoretical work done using integral equation theory @xcite , see @xcite for a review .",
    "all these theoretical efforts contrast with the situation on the experimental side where there are only very few papers dealing with three - body correlations .",
    "one indirect way to obtain information on @xmath5 is via the isothermal pressure derivative of the fluid structure factor @xmath6 which is related to the triplet distribution function @xcite .",
    "this idea has been exploited in rare - gas fluids mainly by egelstaff and coworkers in a series of experimental papers : in krypton @xcite , argon @xcite , helium @xcite and neon @xcite .",
    "but , to our knowledge , there is no direct measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear where the problems come from : x - ray or neutron diffraction data provide information just on the fluid structure factor , i.e. , essentially on the pair - correlation function @xmath7 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath5 , however , requires the knowledge of the positions of three particles at the same time which is technically very demanding to obtain in 3d samples ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "here lies the advantage of video - microscopy , a modern experimental technique applied to colloidal systems to directly measure all particles positions at all times .",
    "essentially , one follows the phase - space trajectory of the system as it evolves in time , and has thus the same amount of information as one obtains in a simulation .",
    "it is rather straightforward to calculate higher - order correlation functions from the measured configurations . in @xcite",
    ", we have recently realized this idea and calculated three - body correlation functions from configurations obtained by video - microscopy from a two - dimensional system of magnetic colloids .",
    "this is probably the first direct measurement of a three - body correlation function . in the present paper",
    "now we give details not mentioned in @xcite , outline a few technical points and present calculations of @xmath5 also for 2d yukawa systems .",
    "the radial pair and three - body distribution functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used to describe the local structure of a fluid and can best be defined by means of the molecular distribution functions @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the lowest order member of this class of functions , @xmath10 , is the probability of finding a particle in the volume @xmath11 at @xmath12 . in an homogeneous medium",
    "it is equal to the density @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the joint probability of finding one particle in the volume @xmath11 at @xmath12 _ and _ a second in the volume @xmath15 at @xmath16 and so on for higher orders . dividing out the asymptotic dependency we obtain the set of @xmath2-body distribution functions @xmath17",
    ": @xmath18 the first non - trivial radial distribution function is @xmath19 which in a homogeneous , isotropic system depends only on the particle separation @xmath20 .",
    "next in order is @xmath21 describing the probability of finding triplets of particles .",
    "configurations of three particles are uniquely characterized by three independent parameters ( in a homogeneous , isotropic medium ) , which can be chosen to be the distances between the particles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 .",
    "the potential of mean force is defined by @xmath26 with @xmath27 for the inverse thermal energy .",
    "the potentials of mean force have to be distinguished from the direct potentials ; so , @xmath28 should not be confused with the direct pair - potential @xmath29 in the system .",
    "the difference between both quantities can best be understood by means of the born - green equation @xcite , @xmath30 relating the difference between the mean force and the direct pair - force to an integral over the force on particle 1 at @xmath31 due to a particle at @xmath32 , weighted by the probability @xmath33 of finding a particle in @xmath34 at @xmath32 when it is known that other particles are located at @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "this equation is a member of the born - green - yvon ( bgy ) hierarchy and is exact if pairwise interactions can be assumed . inserting @xmath36 and using the ksa as a closure relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) yields the bgy integral equation for @xmath7 @xcite .      in a dilute system",
    "the overall interaction is dominated by the interaction of individual pairs .",
    "therefore the probability of finding a certain arrangement of particles is nothing but the joint probability of finding individual pairs . for a triplet with particle distances @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 the approximate triplet distribution function @xmath40 is then the product of the pair distribution functions @xmath41 this is the so called kirkwood superposition approximation ( ksa ) @xcite . introducing the factor @xmath42 correcting the error made by the ksa @xmath43 and the correction potential of mean force @xmath44 @xmath45 we obtain for the triplet potential of mean force @xmath46 @xmath47 all pair correlations in @xmath5 are included in @xmath48 while @xmath42 quantifies the extent of intrinsic correlations due to the simultaneous presence of a triplet of particles .",
    "for this reason , @xmath42 is called the triplet correlation function . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath42 is unity everywhere , there are no genuine triplet correlations in the system , but only the trivial ones that can be expressed by pair correlation functions .",
    "@xmath44 therefore measures the extra correlation energy of three correlated particles relative to the energy of superposed correlated pairs .",
    "one should be careful not to confuse @xmath44 with a real three - body potential @xmath49 : @xmath44 is a correlation energy and can thus have non - vanishing values even in system with particles interacting exclusively via pair - wise additive potentials @xmath29 , i.e. , in cases where higher - order potentials such as @xmath49 are strictly zero .",
    "the triplet functions that we here present are based on a large number of particle configurations obtained from two different colloidal model systems by means of video - microscopy . both systems are two - dimensional ( or more precisely : quasi-2d ) . in the first system particles interact via a tuneable magnetic dipole - dipole interaction and in the second via an electrostatic double - layer interaction .",
    "the first system consists of paramagnetic spherical colloidal particles with an diameter of @xmath50 .",
    "they are located at the bottom of an hanging water droplet whose surface can be accurately controlled to be almost perfectly flat .",
    "the positions of the particles are recorded using digital video - microscopy with subsequent image - processing on the computer .",
    "the field of view has a size of @xmath51 containing typically about @xmath52 particles .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath53 applied perpendicular to the air / water interface induces in each particle a magnetic moment @xmath54 which leads to a repulsive dipole - dipole pair - interaction energy of @xmath55 with the interaction strength given by @xmath56 .",
    "this is the only relevant contribution to the interparticle - potential which is hence conveniently and reversibly adjustable by varying @xmath1 through the external field @xmath53 .",
    "note in particular that by introducing @xmath1 we have scaled out the density .",
    "@xmath1 is thus the only parameter determining the phase - behavior of the system : for @xmath57 the system is liquid , for @xmath58 it is solid , and in between , i.e. for @xmath59 , it shows an hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "the system can be regarded as an almost ideal 2d model system as the out - of - plane motion of the particles corresponds to less than 1 % of their diameter .",
    "details about the preparation of the samples and the experimental set - up can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second system is an aqueous suspension of highly charged sulphate - terminated ps particles of @xmath60 diameter , confined between two glass plates with a 1 mm spacing .",
    "the particles were furthermore exposed to vertical light forces which pushed them toward the negatively - charged silica plate at the bottom of the cell , confining the system more effectively to two dimensions .",
    "the particle center positions were analyzed on - line with an imaging processing software .",
    "the particle density was varied in the system by a scanned optical laser tweezer which acts as a corral for the investigated 2d colloidal suspension .",
    "the particles interact with a screened coulomb potential @xmath61 with the ( effective ) particle charge @xmath62 , the particle diameter @xmath63 , the bjerrum - length @xmath64 and the inverse debye - screening - length @xmath65 . via the inversion of the ornstein - zernicke equation for a low density system we can determine the potential quite accurately .",
    "this experiment and also the inversion procedure has been described in great detail in @xcite . in fact , we here compute triplet correlation functions based on exactly the same set of configurations as already evaluated for other purposes in @xcite . pair - correlation functions corresponding to the triplet correlation functions of this work can also be found in @xcite .    in both systems",
    ", we made sure that the system is well equilibrated and used about 200 statistically independent configurations with approximately 500 - 1000 particles .",
    "we also performed standard monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations , which offers us a third way to generate the necessary set of particle configurations .",
    "the simulations produced typically 500 configurations with 2000 particles yielding much better statistics and the opportunity to check the experimental results for statistical errors .",
    "the numerical procedure for computing @xmath5 is essentially the same as the one used in simulations to determine @xmath7 .",
    "for every configuration we counted the triplets with sidelengths @xmath66 and @xmath39 in an array @xmath67 $ ] such that @xmath68 and accordingly for @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath69 .",
    "while normalizing @xmath70 means each slot is divided by the area @xmath71 it covers , we can write down in analogy an analytic expression for @xmath5 valid for infinitesimal small @xmath72 : @xmath73 this expression also works fine for finite @xmath74 ( replace @xmath72 by @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normg3an ] ) ) except in the case of triangles with one angle close to 180 degrees . for example",
    ", a triangle with @xmath75 would be sorted into the slots @xmath76 .",
    "the center values of these slots obviously do not represent a triangle and thus the normalizing procedure fails because the square root in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normg3an ] ) turns imaginary .",
    "while we can neglect these slots for most of the plots presented , we can not ignore these counts when integrating over the whole @xmath5 as it is done in the section on the born - green equation . in these cases",
    "we are not allowed to replace @xmath72 by @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normg3an ] ) , but , instead , we have to compute the normalization factor numerically . for",
    "a fixed distance @xmath37 one can easily calculate the intersection area @xmath77 of two circular rings with radii @xmath78 and width @xmath74 .",
    "the numerical normalization factor @xmath79 is then @xmath80 more technical details can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we first concentrate on the equilateral triangle configuration . for this special configuration",
    "we have @xmath81 and the superposition approximation reduces to @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 and a comparison of @xmath7 and @xmath84 reveals the importance of the triplet correlation function @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) shows @xmath86 and @xmath84 for the system with the magnetic colloids ( fig .",
    "( [ fig1].a ) ) and that with the charged colloids ( fig .",
    "( [ fig1].b ) ) . for each system type",
    ", we have analyzed three different densities ( @xmath1-values ) , where the systems are always deep in the liquid phase .",
    "these are : @xmath87 for the magnetic system and @xmath88 for the charged system .    as expected , at low density ( small @xmath1 ) kirkwood s superposition approximation holds very well .",
    "these are then weakly interacting systems in which particles sparsely `` meet '' other particles and usually interact only with a single other particle .",
    "the probability of finding a certain triplet is thus nothing but the joint probability of finding the appropriate pairs , and therefore the ksa is justified by the independence of the particular pair probabilities .",
    "increasing the interaction strength @xmath1",
    "( i.e. , the density in the charged system ) particles begin to interact with more than one other particle at a time .",
    "the assumption that a third particle will not interfere with the statistical distribution of the second particle begins to deteriorate .",
    "one can see that in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) : the first peak of @xmath89 is always reduced in height compared to @xmath7 and the first minimum deviates even stronger .",
    "it is always more pronounced for @xmath89 and it changes its shape from the sine - like oscillation of @xmath7 to a more asymmetric one .",
    "this seem to be just a packing effect which is relatively independent of the interaction potential between the particles , as is evident from the surprisingly close resemblance between the curves in fig .",
    "( [ fig1].a ) and ( [ fig1].b ) .",
    "note , however , that shape and height of the first peak is different for both systems , as one would expect for different pair - potentials .",
    "the dashed and solid lines represent the results of our simulations , using the pair - potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ug ] ) and ( [ eq : uy ] ) . in the charged system , the prefactor and the inverse screening length has been used as a fit - parameter .",
    "the good agreement between simulation and experimental data found for both the pair- and triplet distribution functions demonstrates that the correlations can in both systems be understood in terms of a picture of pair - wise interacting particles , although it has to be emphasized that in the charged system the pair - potential is an effective ( density - dependent ) one in which  through the fitting procedure ",
    "many - body contributions are absorbed into the pair - potential , see discussions in @xcite . by contrast , many - body interactions in the magnetic system can be safely ruled out @xcite .",

    "we take @xmath94 which is the distance where @xmath7 has its first peak ( almost equal to @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is the most probable distance between any pair of particles in the fluid . for this choice",

    "the lighter grey to white areas correspond to values below and the darker grey to black areas to values above the limiting value @xmath104 .",
    "clearly , the plot is highly redundant , for symmetry reasons it would have been sufficient to just show one quarter of it . in addition , we show circles with radii corresponding to the first and second maximum ( white circles ) and the first minimum ( black circles ) of @xmath7 around each particle .    with these circles",
    "the ksa prediction can be easily understood .",
    "first we expect a very pronounced peak where the two circles with the shortest radii intersect . at this position",
    "is @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; therefore both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are at their maximum and that maximizes @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g3sarmax ] ) .",
    "this position corresponds to an equilateral triangle configuration .",
    "accordingly , the first minimum on the @xmath109-axis occurs where the two black circles intersect . following the inner white circle around the right particle means keeping @xmath105 constant . at the point where this line intersects the black circle  indicating the first minimum of @xmath108  we encounter a local minimum along that line .",
    "following further the circle @xmath105 the second maximum of @xmath108 becomes important .",
    "but since the two circles intersect almost tangential there is no distinctive structure but a plateau - like  banana  enclosing the particle on the outside . in a similar way , all other local maxima and minima in @xmath48 can be explained by combining the maxima and minima of @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",

    "the stripes that can be seen especially close to the x - axis result from the transformation @xmath112 to @xmath113 and appear due to limited statistics .",

    "for @xmath115 ( the angle @xmath116 is defined in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) ) the peak matches almost exactly the grid point of the underlying hexagonal lattice while for @xmath117 is slightly shifted to the inside and is not so pronounced . in the shell of second nearest neighbors",
    "there is also some inner structure developing but a clear correspondence to the lattice points is not yet recognizable .",
    "by contrast , there is no such correspondence between the peak - structure of @xmath48 and the lattice sites when the ksa is applied .",
    "so this crystal - like local order that shows up already between particles in the fluid phase , is obviously a genuine effect of triplet correlations .",
    "again , there is a remarkably close resemblance between the results for the magnetic and the charged system , demonstrating that these correlation effects have little to do with the properties of the pair - potential .    to quantify our analysis ,",

    "it can be clearly seen that at up to @xmath125 @xmath5 and @xmath48 are almost identical and that at @xmath126 the full correlation function @xmath5 shows a peak - structure in close correspondence with the hexagonal structure .",

    "for example , for @xmath135 , differences between both sides are to be seen only on the midplane .    the closer the system approaches the crystalline phase the more pronounced do we expect the lattice points to be occupied .",

    "three - particle correlations are thus seen to be important not only to obtain locally the correct structure , but also to obtain globally the correct difference between mean and direct force via the born - green equation .    in principle , higher - order correlation functions could be computed from the measured configurations in very much the same way , but it is not clear to us what they could be useful for .",

    "one has to be aware , however , that in three dimensions a similar correspondence between the peaks in @xmath5 and an underlying crystal lattice should be much harder to find . in 3d ,",
    "every triplet of particle lies , of course , also in a plane , and can accordingly be plotted as in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , then there is not one , but a superposition of many possible lattice planes that one has to compare this distribution with . in this respect ,",
    "the role of a crystal lattice in determining the structure of a liquid is probably more pronounced in 2d than it is in 3d .",
