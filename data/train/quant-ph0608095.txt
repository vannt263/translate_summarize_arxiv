    "maximally entangled states are the main resource in quantum information ( qi ) processing .",
    "protocols like teleportation of quantum states @xcite and entanglement based quantum cryptography @xcite , just to cite the two most emblematic , work with perfect fidelity only when maximally entangled bipartite states are available .",
    "( as maximally entangled bipartite states are equivalent by local unitary transformations , they are usually referred to as _",
    "singlets _ in the jargon of qi . ) on the other hand , even if one has a source of perfect singlets , the ever present decoherence , due to interactions with the environment , degrades these states to mixed form with reduced entanglement .",
    "@xcite showed that this practical difficulty could be circumvented by _ distilling _ singlets from mixed states .",
    "this process involves only local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) and , in principle , is able to purify any mixed state to a singlet form , given that an arbitrary supply of the former is available .",
    "the process works at the expense of sacrificing many of the mixed states in order to concentrate their entanglement to a singlet .",
    "et al . _ showed [ 4,5 ] that only states which violate the peres criterion @xcite can be distilled , _",
    "i.e. _ , the non - positivity of the partial transpose ( npt ) is a necessary condition for distillability .",
    "it was then realized that there are entangled states which are not directly useful in qi processing , they are said to be _ bound entangled _",
    "@xcite , and the states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) are of this kind .",
    "nevertheless , these states can be _ activated _ @xcite , in the sense that , used in conjunction with npt states , they can enhance the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "therefore we have two kinds of entanglement in nature , namely , bound and free .",
    "the set of bound entangled states includes all the ppt ones , but it is not known if there are npt states in this set .",
    "it was conjectured by divincenzo _",
    "_ @xcite and dur _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that , in fact , there exist bound entangled npt states .",
    "it can be shown that any bipartite npt state can be transformed by locc to a werner state @xcite , keeping the fidelity to the singlet .",
    "the process is performed by _ twirling _ ( see @xcite , for example ) the states through the action of bi - local unitary operations ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus the study of distillability of arbitrary bipartite states is reduced to the distillability properties of werner states .",
    "formally , a bipartite state ( @xmath1 ) is distillable if and only if there exists a schmidt rank two pure state ( @xmath2 ) , in the hilbert space in which @xmath3 acts , such that @xmath4 is less than zero for some finite integer @xmath5 [ 5,8,9 ] , @xmath6 meaning partial transposition .",
    "when this condition is verified for some @xmath5 , @xmath3 is said to be @xmath5-distillable .",
    "in particular , all the bipartite entangled states of the kind qubit - qudit ( @xmath7 ) are 1-distillable [ 5,11 ] .    in the same fashion that the entanglement of a state can be decided by an",
    "_ entanglement witness _",
    "operator @xcite , kraus _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the distillability also can be decided by means of a kind of witness operator @xcite . in this paper , we show how to calculate these _ distillability witnesses _ using robust semidefinite programs ( rsdp ) @xcite and apply it to study one- and two - distillability of werner states .",
    "starting with some definitions in section ii , we revise the rsdp formalism in section iii . sections iv and v present numerical results for the distillability of werner states in the one- and two - copy cases . in section",
    "vi , we derive some interesting expressions for the _ distillability witness _ and for a tensor product of werner states , with arbitrary @xmath5 , and then we conclude .",
    "the set of non - entangled ( separable ) states is convex and closed , therefore it follows from the separating hyperplane theorem that there exists a linear functional ( _ hyperplane _ ) that separates an entangled state from this set , this results in an entanglement witness @xcite .",
    "thus an ew ( @xmath8 ) is a hermitian operator with non - negative expectation value for all the separable states , but which can have a negative expectation value for an entangled state , in this case , the state is said to be detected by the ew .",
    "an ew which can be written in the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 positive operators , is said to be _",
    "decomposable _ , and it is non - decomposable if it can not be put in this form . only non - decomposable ews can detect ppt states .",
    "when the ew ( hyperplane ) is tangent to the separable set , it is said to be optimal ( see @xcite , for example ) .    to be distillable [ 4,12 ] , a bipartite state @xmath1 , or a finite tensor product of it ( @xmath12 ) , must have a projection which is npt on a four - dimensional subspace , that is , given a schmidt rank two state , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are bases defining bi - dimensional subspaces in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the schmidt coefficients ; @xmath3 is distillable if the inequality @xmath20 is satisfied for some arbitrary @xmath21 , of the form of ( [ eq2 ] ) , and some finite integer @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath27 is a swap operator for two qudits , @xmath28 and its partial transpose is the bipartite maximally entangled state : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the identity in the space of the two qudits ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "equivalently to the inequality ( [ desigualdade ] ) , kraus et.al . showed @xcite that the distillability of an arbitrary state @xmath3 ( we will consider only the bipartite case @xmath32 ) can be decided through the operator : @xmath33 with @xmath34 acting in @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) being the hilbert space of a qubit belonging to a ( b ) .",
    "if @xmath34 is not an ew , then @xmath12 is n - distillable .",
    "if @xmath34 is a non - decomposable ew , then the ppt entangled state it detects ( @xmath38 ) activates @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 is 1-distillable .",
    "when @xmath34 is decomposable ( and in the case of werner states it happens to be a positive operator ) , then @xmath12 is undistillable and unactivable .",

    "our main goal is to decide if the operator @xmath34 ( _ cf .",

    "our numerical calculations will be restricted to qutrit werner states(@xmath65 ) , therefore @xmath66 .",

    "i.e. _ , a hyperplane tangent to the separable set .",
    "notice that in fig.1 , we have a family of non - optimal ews , the planes for @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , these calculations show that the werner states are 1-undistillable for @xmath104 .",
    "of course the 1-undistillability of werner states is not a novelty [ 8,9 ] .",
    "the interesting result here is the technique to decide if the kraus - lewenstein - cirac operator ( [ kraus - w ] ) @xcite is an ew .",
    "the strategy was to compare the candidate to ew with the optimal ew of a certain ppt state , which can be obtained with arbitrary precision by means of the rsdp ( [ optimalw ] ) , and to show that the candidate operator converges to this ew . in this sense",
    "our calculations are exact , leaving no room to doubt if the candidate operator is or is not an ew .",
    "this technique extends straightforwardly to higher dimensions .",
    "the other interesting result is that we obtain a family of ppt entangled states , @xmath117 ( _ cf . _",

    "the best results so far showed 2-undistillability analytically [ 8,9 ] in the region @xmath133 , and provided numerical evidence in @xmath134 .",
    "we note that our calculations have been made in a laptop with 1 gbytes of memory , and we used the symmetry of the werner states to reduce the parameters in the optimization problem . in a larger computer , maybe the 3-copy case could be handled , but the 4-copy case would need more than 5 gbytes , just to load the basis set ( [ base ] ) .",
    "one could try to explore the symmetry to reduce the matrices size , but in face of the constraints in the robust sdp ( _ cf .",
