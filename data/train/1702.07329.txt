    "a medium with chiral anomaly responds to magnetic field by generation of anomalous electric current flowing in the magnetic field direction .",
    "the strength of this response is determined by the chiral conductivity @xmath0 .",
    "the induced current in turn produces the magnetic field in medium .",
    "this process obeys the maxwell equations that yield an equation for the magnetic field in a chiral medium [ i11 ] -^2 b= -_t^2b+_b . assuming that @xmath0 is time - independent constant , a solution to ( [ i11 ] ) can be written as a superposition of the chandrasekhar - kendall states @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a circularly polarized plane wave with momentum @xmath1 [ i13 ] b_k~e^ikr \\{-it_1 } , where @xmath2 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the state with @xmath3 and @xmath4 grows exponentially with time at @xmath5 indicating that the magnetic field is unstable in the chiral medium .",
    "this effect and its consequences have been discussed in various contexts @xcite .",
    "the chiral conductivity is actually a function of time since energy and helicity are exchanged between the chiral medium and the magnetic field due to the chiral anomaly .",
    "it has been recently argued in @xcite that the instability of the magnetic field is curtailed by the total energy and helicity conservation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate this mechanism in more detail . to this end",
    ", the vector potential is expanded into a complete set of the helicity states .",
    "the circularly polarized plane waves are used in this paper , but the same result can obtained with any other chandrasekhar - kendall states as well .",
    "the vector potential is then approximated by a single fastest growing ( as a function of time ) state .",
    "momentum @xmath6 of the fastest growing state is proportional to the chiral conductivity and hence is a function of time .",
    "this is different from the monochromatic approximation discussed in @xcite , where the momentum of a monochromatic state is constant . in the present model , the rate of the state growth",
    "is determined by the anomaly equation .    in order to solve the maxwell and the chiral anomaly equations one needs to know the equation of state of the medium that relates the chiral charge density to the axial chemical potential .",
    "we consider two equations of state ( [ g17 ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) corresponding to hot and cold media . in each case",
    "an analytical solution is derived for the chiral conductivity and magnetic field",

    "one can see that the vector potential increases rapidly with time .",

    "we proceed by expanding the vector potential into eigenstates of the curl operator @xmath14 , known also as the chandrasekhar - kendall ( ck ) states @xcite .",
    "a particular form of these functions is not important , but its easier to deal with them in cartesian coordinates where they are represented by the circularly polarized plane waves [ b11 ] w_k(x)= e^ikx , where @xmath15 is volume and @xmath16 corresponds to the right and left polarizations .",

    "it can be solved in the adiabatic approximation , which is adequate for analysis of the unstable states .",
    "namely , we are seeking a solution in the form [ b22 ] a_k = e^-i_0^t_k(t)dt and assume that @xmath18 is a slow varying function , which allows one to neglect terms proportional to @xmath19 .",
