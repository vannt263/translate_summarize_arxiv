    "we define this value to be the rate at which the probability distribution is 1% of its maximum . based on results shown in",
    ", we deduce that a typical maximum value is approximately .",
    "it is apparent in that the weight of the gaussian distribution at becomes sizeable at @xmath101  k. this means that spins begin to be frozen well above 13  k in some regions of the sample .",
    "our @xmath102  k agrees perfectly with the appearance of a coherent precession of the muon spin in a @xmath25 single crystal similar to ours  @xcite .    here",
    ", it must be recognized that @xmath103  s@xmath52 probably also represents a cutoff value above which the @xmath1la nmr signal is unobservable ( wipeout phenomenon )  @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency of the above analysis  @xcite suggests that our data correctly describe the spin dynamics of the system at least down to 20  k.    for the disordered sample , the freezing occurs at a lower temperature : @xmath104 shows a peak at @xmath105  k and @xmath106  15  k. this is consistent with the qualitative analysis discussed in the previous section and with the decrease of @xmath107 from 30  k ( pristine )  @xcite to 25  k ( disordered )  @xcite , as determined by neutron scattering .",
    "since the elastic ns signal is integrated over a typical energy window of @xmath401 mev and the slowing down of the fluctuations occurs on a relatively wide @xmath19 range , we observe @xmath108 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath36 values acquires a significant width only at @xmath109  k and below . the fact that @xmath110 at @xmath111  k and 100  k is remarkable .",
    "this means that the distribution of @xmath5 values seen by @xmath112cu or @xmath113o nmr at these temperatures , and attributed to a nanoscale inhomogeneity of the hole concentration  @xcite , is completely absent in the @xmath1la @xmath36 data .",
    "this contrasting situation is explained by two facts : first , the hyperfine field at @xmath1la sites results from the coupling to several electronic sites in two different cuo@xmath7 planes .",
    "thus , the hyperfine field is spatially more homogeneous than the electronic density .",
    "second , the relatively weak amplitude of this ( transferred ) hyperfine field produces much weaker differences in the @xmath36 values for @xmath1la than for @xmath112cu or @xmath113o .",
    "still , the @xmath114 inhomogeneity , which shows up at lower temperature , appears to be correlated to inhomogeneities in the static local magnetization , as revealed by the similar temperature dependence of both the distribution width @xmath69 and the static @xmath1la linewidth shown in and , respectively .",
    "however , for the reasons given above , no direct correlation between the inhomogeneity of @xmath115 and the resonance frequency across the @xmath1la line could be established .    since @xmath113o and @xmath116cu nmr signals undergo a significant wipeout below @xmath4050  k  @xcite , it is difficult to know whether the inhomogeneity probed in @xmath1la @xmath36 measurements below @xmath4060  k is distinct from the one probed at higher temperatures and attributed to spatial variation of the hole concentration . at any given temperature below @xmath4020  k , the difference in @xmath3 values between @xmath25 and @xmath39 samples exceeds an order of magnitude . however , even if the amplitude of the nanoscale doping inhomogeneity does not produce a significant effects on the @xmath1la nmr at @xmath40100  k , the possibility that it produces the large @xmath114 distribution at low @xmath19 can not be discarded . on the other hand , it is possible that magnetic heterogeneity ( ubiquitous in glassy systems ) develops prior to the glass transition in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 , in addition to a nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity . in support to this is the fact that spin freezing and substantial magnetic inhomogeneity are reported in yba@xmath7cu@xmath117o@xmath118  @xcite , while a significant nanoscale variation of the hole concentration is apparently absent in this system  @xcite .",
    "as evident in , @xmath36 values are typically distributed over more than one order of magnitude at low @xmath19 , that is @xmath69 reaches a value of @xmath119 at @xmath76 .",
    "this width does not depend strongly on the number of holes since similar values of @xmath69 are observed for @xmath39  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ results ] ) and @xmath120  @xcite ( not shown ) at @xmath121 .",
    "strikingly , the same value of @xmath122 is found at @xmath123 in both pristine and disordered samples for @xmath25  .",
    "thus , the distribution width appears to be insensitive to an @xmath124% of in - plane disorder as well .",
    "one could argue that this result can be explained by the fact that la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath11 is already a significantly disordered material in its pristine version .",
    "however , this argument does not hold since a typical 1  % of non - magnetic impurities or vacancies is highly detrimental to @xmath0 and it clearly affects other magnetic properties as well  @xcite .",
    "finally , we will comment on alternative explanations of the stretched - exponential behavior of the nmr relaxation .",
    "it was suggested that the inhomogeneous magnetic state is related to extended charge density waves with imaginary order parameter @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the observed inhomogeneity in the nmr and @xmath14sr quantities would originate from sliding motions of orbital currents coexisting with the @xmath125-wave superconducting state .",
    "it is known that any order parameter of @xmath125-wave symmetry should be highly sensitive to impurities .",
    "this is in contrast to our data , showing that the inhomogeneity of @xmath114 is insensitive to 1% of atomic disorder .",
    "therefore , the scenario is unlikely to account for our observations .",
    "furthermore , a power - law time dependence of the spin - spin correlation function , instead of a distribution , is also debated in canonical spin - glasses as an explanation for the stretched - exponential nmr or @xmath14sr relaxation  @xcite . anyhow",
    ", we did not consider this possibility as the presence of magnetic heterogeneity in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 is established by various experimental facts , such as the partial wipeout of the nmr signal or the @xmath19-dependent broadening of the nmr linewidth .",
    "we have presented an nmr investigation of la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath11 , a prototypal material for studying spin - glass and stripe - ordering instabilities in the superconducting regime .",
    "our analysis can be viewed as a parametrization of the stretched - exponential spin - lattice relaxation of @xmath1la nuclei .",
    "we observe that this phenomenon is not affected by a @xmath401  % level of disorder .",
    "this result might thus support proposals  @xcite of heterogeneous dynamics , or more generally of glassiness , which is not due to quenched disorder .",
    "however , how much of the magnetic heterogeneity / glassiness of la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 is attributable to nanoscale variation of the hole doping remains unclear .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate whether our results for the special @xmath25 material still hold in samples with lower sr concentration , including the non superconducting cluster spin - glass region of the phase diagram .",
