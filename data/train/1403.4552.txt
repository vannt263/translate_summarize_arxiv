    "it is an electrostatic instability that occurs when the relative drift between ions and electrons is larger than the electron thermal velocity.@xcite in our earlier paper ( che et al .",
    "2013 , paper i hereafter)@xcite , we used pic simulations to investigate the mechanism of fast electron heating in strong buneman instability .",
    "we found that the fast energy exchange between waves and electrons is achieved by the adiabatic motion of trapped electrons .",
    "the energy gained from waves by these trapped electrons is converted into heat through trapping and de - trapping processes . in this paper , we use the same pic simulation to investigate the macroscopic effects caused by strong buneman instability .",
    "we show that , besides anomalous heating , macroscopic momentum transports are also induced .",
    "it is found that a bernoulli - like equation governs the energy exchange between waves and the electrons , and links microscopic wave - electron momentum exchange to macroscopic momentum transports .",
    "this localized quasi - static equation couples with the equation of anomalous heating ( which is a global effect ) to form a set of fluid equations that describe buneman instability .",
    "more interestingly , the associated magnetic energy is dissipated through the heating of electrons in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this process is decoupled from the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the electron stream .",
    "while turbulence - induced friction or drag is shown to play a similar role in turbulence heating as collisions do in joule heating , we found that the heating rate of buneman turbulence depends on the changing rate of the kinetic energy density rather than on the kinetic energy density as in joule heating .",
    "another new finding is that strong buneman turbulence naturally truncates the electron momentum equation and provides the closure for pressure .",
    "ions play an important role in assisting the energy exchange between waves and electrons even though ions are weakly heated .",

    "therefore , buneman wave away from the mid - plane has all three electric field components as it propagates along the magnetic field.@xcite as a result electron heating is in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field . in the following",

    "the propagation of buneman waves deviate from @xmath52 in the @xmath158 plane with the increase of @xmath58 .",
    "( [ enxy ] ) tells us that the perpendicular electric fields convert magnetic energy into thermal energy to produce perpendicular thermal pressure , i.e. the dissipated magnetic energy produces perpendicular heating in the thin current , or @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "as y get close to @xmath196 , the edge of the current sheet , electric fields become very weak .",
    "consequently the heating is very weak and the magnetic pressure @xmath197 is approximately constant in time .    in the mid - plane @xmath198 and the loss of magnetic energy @xmath199",
    "is balanced by heating in @xmath69 and @xmath58 .",
    "the loss of average magnetic energy @xmath200 is countered by the gain of @xmath201 , as shown in fig .",

    "and the right panel is @xmath202 . ]",
    "we further show the time evolution of average magnetic energy loss @xmath203 and the average thermal energy gain @xmath204 along @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ b_y ] . to allow",
    "easy comparison , the absolute values of average magnetic energy loss is shown .",
    "it is obvious that the two agree with each other in the thin current layer . at the edge of the current @xmath205 ,",
    "the loss of magnetic energy and heating become nearly zero .",
    "therefore , we have , @xmath206    the change of @xmath207 equals to the loss of the electron kinetic energy @xmath208 .",
    "the latter leads to the loss of magnetic energy via the ampere s law @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , @xmath210 thus the equipartition between parallel and perpendicular thermal energy is a direct consequence of the ampere s law when the current sheet is of electron scale , i.e @xmath211 .    in principle",
    ", at each layer with @xmath212 , we can apply our 1d @xmath52-component fluid description of buneman turbulence and the corresponding parallel heating the same way as we do at @xmath51",
    ". however , the time evolution of the magnetic field and heating is beyond the scope of this paper since it requires a full 3d model of buneman instability .",
    "we have found the electron fluid description ( eq .",
    "( [ einnav ] ) , ( [ 2ohm ] ) and ( [ conversion ] ) ) of the macroscopic effects produced by the wave - particle interactions in buenman instability .",
    "we have so far neglected the dynamics of ions for the following reason : the time scale of buneman instability @xmath213 is much smaller than the ion gyro - period @xmath214 and similar to the ion dynamical responding time scale @xmath215 . on the other hand",
    "the time scale of the instability is comparable to the electron gyro - period @xmath216 and much longer than the electron dynamical responding time scale @xmath217 .",
    "thus energy exchanges primarily between waves and electrons rather than with ions , the thermalization generated by trapping and de - trapping of ions is much weaker than that of electrons and the wave energy loss to ions can be neglected this is consistent with the approximate conservation of the total energy in electron fluid description during buneman instability .    during the buneman instability",
    "the oscillation of ions in waves facilitates the energy exchange between waves and electrons but the heating of ions is negligible .",
    "therefore the ion momentum equation can be simplified as @xmath218    it should be noted that buneman instability is triggered by the relative drift between electrons and ions . in the case that the ions drift is non - zero , we must replace @xmath94 by @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the ion drift , and pressure by @xmath221 in the electron fluid equations we obtained .",
    "the ion drift does not affect the dissipation of magnetic energy since the current sheet is determined by the relative drift @xmath219 .    to summarize",

    "( [ bunohm ] ) replace eq .",
    "( [ einnav ] ) so that both electron and ion use momentum equations .",
    "in this paper we have studied the macroscopic momentum transports and energy dissipation generated by wave - particle interactions in buneman instability in the mid - plane of a thin current layer with a guide magnetic field .",
    "this study is important for the understanding of the role of diffusion region kinetic turbulence in magnetic reconnection .",
    "using pic simulations and detailed analysis of electron fluid equations , we found    1 .",
    "buneman electrostatic waves propagate along the magnetic field and leads to parallel momentum transports and dissipation of electron kinetic energy . in the mid - plane",
    ", buneman instability behaves like a 1d problem along the guide field @xmath224 .",
    "the global energy dissipation and local momentum transports during buneman instability are two separable processes and the electric field generated by buneman instability can be separated into two components : the low frequency inductive electric fields @xmath124 and high frequency turbulence fluctuations @xmath130 . as a result ,",
    "the electron momentum equation ( eq .  [ turbflu ] ) that incorporates turbulence drag is split into two equations for @xmath124 and @xmath130 respectively . the first equation ( eq .  [ einnav ] )",
    "describes the global damping of electron kinetic energy produced by drag and the acceleration of electrons produced by @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath124 is induced by the loss of the magnetic energy associated with the electron streams . the second equation ( eq .  [ 2ohm ] )",
    "describes the macroscopic balance in the localized buneman solitary waves among the electric force , the local convective momentum and thermal momentum transports . a different form of eq .",
    "( [ 2ohm ] ) , i.e. eq .  ( [ dber ] ) , is similar to the well known bernoulli equation in fluid mechanics , a direct consequence of the locally quasi - static nature of buneman instability . this equation can stop the growth of buneman instability .",
    "the buneman instability saturates when the drift decreases below the threshold of buneman instability .",
    "drag couples local momentum transports with global energy dissipation , and links the microscopic heating process inside the localized buneman solitary waves to the macroscopic kinetic energy dissipation of electrons .",
    "the dissipated kinetic energy of electron stream is converted into the parallel electron heat along the magnetic field in the mid - plane .",
    "the local conservation of total energy is a result of the very efficient energy exchanges between electrons and solitary waves during buneman instability .",
    "this condition truncates the infinite moments of fluid equations .",
    "thus , we have found a set of equations , including eq .",
    "( [ einnav ] ) , ( [ 2ohm ] ) and ( [ conversion ] ) , for the macroscopic effects of buneman instability in the mid - plane of a thin current layer .",
    "the electron fluid equations together with cold ion equations form a complete description of buneman instability as listed in   [ ioninfluence ] .",
    "if the drift of ions @xmath220 is non - zero , the electron fluid equations for buneman instability should be transferred to the ion s rest frame by replacing @xmath94 and pressure @xmath207 by @xmath219 and @xmath225 respectively .",
    "dissipation by buneman turbulence is irreversible as seen in the monotonic increase of boltzmann entropy .",
    "the fastest increase of entropy occurs at the time when the growth of buneman instability peaks .",
    ".   magnetic energy dissipation is associated with the perpendicular components of buneman waves .",
    "the magnetic energy is converted into electron thermal energy as shown in the increases of the perpendicular components of the pressure tensor .",
    "the process is decoupled from the parallel heating .",
    "the ratio of perpendicular and parallel heating rate is proportional to @xmath226 .",
    "the observed equipartition of heating rate between parallel and perpendicular directions in our simulation is a result of the width of the current layer being @xmath227 .",
    "it is useful to highlight the similarities and differences between joule heating produced by collisions and turbulence heating caused by wave - particle interactions  or drag as it s macroscopic manifestation . both drag and collisions can dissipate kinetic energy and cause the increase of the temperature and entropy , but the underlying physics are different : 1 ) drag is generated by wave - particle interactions while collision is generated by particle - particle interactions ; 2 ) drag is the feature of kinetic instabilities that produces non - equilibrium structures , such as localized intense electric field and non - maxwellian velocity distribution , while collisions tend to drive the system to equilibrium and produce maxwellian velocity distribution ; 3 ) heating induced by drag has a time lag @xmath228 in the conversion of convective momentum to thermal momentum during the growth of buneman waves . the time lag is of the buneman turbulence time scale @xmath229 . compared with collisions",
    ", @xmath228 is much shorter than the collision time scale @xmath230 .",
    "the effects of turbulence dissipation is commonly parameterized as effective anomalous resistivity @xmath17 in mhd theory . in this parameterization drag",
    "assumes a resistivity - like form @xmath231 , and the dissipation rate has the simplest form of joule heating , i.e. , @xmath232 .",
    "we can see that in this parameterization @xmath233 depends on kinetic energy density rather than the changing rate of kinetic energy density as we have found for buneman instability . as a method to estimate the level of anomalous heating",
    "if we do not know the underlying physics , parameterization is still the simplest and most effective method .    in most cases ,",
    "we are only interested in the heating effect of buneman instability rather than the form of buneman waves . in such cases only eq .",
    "( [ einnav ] ) and ( [ conversion ] ) associated with the global effects are useful , but we must give @xmath234 , which can be obtained either with kinetic theory or fitting of pic simulations .",
    "given @xmath235 we have        the ultimate question is whether turbulence dissipation / heating can accelerate magnetic reconnection . comparing with the time scale of large scale magnetic reconnection @xmath237 , @xmath228 is still quite short .",
    "this implies that anomalous heating on kinetic scale has the potential to impact on large scale reconnection .",
