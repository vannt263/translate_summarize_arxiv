    "ferroelastic materials undergo first order transitions that are characterized by a lattice strain or shuffle , and transform from a high temperature strain - disordered paraelastic state ( austenite ) to a low temperature strain - ordered ferroelastic state ( martensite ) where long - range elastic interactions are important .",
    "it is known that the thermodynamics of such phase transitions is strongly influenced by the presence of disorder  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "statistical compositional fluctuations play a fundamental role in bringing about a precursory strain state known as tweed .",
    "this is a crosshatched pattern observed well above the martensitic - transformation start temperature  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on ferroelastic alloys have shown that by introducing disorder via doping point defects or compositional variations beyond a critical value , an abnormal glass - like state which is a frozen state of local strain order , can be generated below a transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "this glass phase was initially observed in ni - rich ti@xmath1ni@xmath3 where the austenitic @xmath4 parent structure appeared to persist to 0 k above a compositional threshold @xmath5 , below which it transformed to a martensitic @xmath6 phase  @xcite .",
    "this so called `` strain glass '' is of interest not only from a theoretical point of view but it has been shown to display superelasticity and shape memory effects , which are typically seen in austenite and martensitic states  @xcite .",
    "experiments and theory have so far provided little understanding of the nature of the glassy behavior in ferroelastic materials and its relationship to other strain states .",
    "for example , the tweed has been the subject of a number of theoretical studies and has variously been interpreted as a `` glass '' phase  @xcite .",
    "although recent experiments distinguish strain glass from tweed  @xcite , the claims are largely based on diagnostics that monitor certain static and dynamic aspects of the materials ; these include the broken ergodicity of static properties ( _ e.g. _ , the strain measured by zero field and field cooling ( fc - zfc ) ) , or frequency dispersion of dynamic properties  @xcite .",
    "however , non glassy phases , such as polytwins in martensite or nanostructured ferromagnetics ( _ e.g. _ ferecr ) , also show similar non - ergodic static behavior and frequency dispersion  @xcite .",
    "in addition , although numerical simulations based on continuum landau descriptions in the presence of disorder  @xcite can reproduce some form of the experimental results  @xcite , such solutions are also based on similar empirical diagnostics and tend not to be predictive . therefore , there is a need for a predictive approach using analytical techniques that would allow the various ordered and disordered ferroelastic states to be distinguished and which can be experimentally verified .    in this paper , we provide a thermodynamic interpretation of the known strain states in a ferroelastic system , including austenite , martensite , tweed and strain glass .",
    "after mapping the problem onto a spin model , we use real space renormalization group ( rg ) methods to analytically calculate thermodynamic phases in terms of rg attractive fixed points .",
    "the rg approach progressively integrates out microscopic degrees of freedom so that the attractive basins characterize the physics at large scales .",
    "the values of the interaction strength and strength of disorder uniquely characterize the different phases , including the frustrated glassy state , thereby allowing the phase diagram in terms of temperature and disorder to be determined .",
    "we thus theoretically determine the phase diagram of a model ferroelastic , and the phase diagram predicts a spontaneous transition from strain glass to martensite if the strength of disorder in the system has intermediate values .",
    "this latter aspect was not recognized previously , although the spontaneous transition has been recently speculated  @xcite .",
    "we verify these predictions by mapping out the experimental diagram for a ternary ferroelastic ti@xmath0(pd@xmath1cr@xmath2 ) alloy ( where @xmath7 is the atomic concentration of cr ) and examining its consequences .",
    "moreover , our calculations show that the tweed phase can be interpreted as a thermodynamic equilibrium phase .",
    "our model thus provides a unified , consistent framework to understand the various experimental and theoretical studies on the glassy behavior associated with ferroelastic materials .",
    "moreover , we find that the long range elastic interaction or the precise form of the disorder are not crucial to describing the phase diagram .",
    "these ideas are well recognized for spin glasses but are not as well known within the strain glass community .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in the first section ,",
    "we review how effective spin models can be deduced from ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functionals , and we discuss the various means to include quenched disorder in the model .",
    "the second section is devoted to the calculation of the analytical phase diagram from our model in the presence of disorder .",
    "we explain how a real - space rg procedure can be implemented and we present several approaches and approximations to solve the resulting equations .",
    "the results are compared to monte - carlo simulations and we provide a discussion of the relevance of simplified numerical algorithms  be it a one - spin flip monte - carlo or the steepest - descent method for continuum gl models for these types of problems .",
    "the role of the long - range interactions is also discussed in relation to previous work .",
    "section  [ section - exp ] contains our experimental results on ti@xmath0(pd@xmath1cr@xmath2 ) alloys .",
    "we measure the transformation behavior of the alloys by means of dynamical mechanical analysis ( dma ) and the electric resistivity . in - situ",
    "synchrotron x - ray and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) were employed to detect the predicted spontaneous phase transformation .",
    "our experiments lead to a phase diagram that is very similar to the one we establish analytically .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in the broader context of ferroelastic transitions in general and the possible generalizations of our theoretical work to more complex transitions .",
    "our approach is to use a model that captures the salient physics and microstructure associated with ferroelastic transformations .",
    "we will use a pseudo - spin model derived from a continuum formulation based on a landau potential and strain compatibility forces  @xcite .",
    "the addition of quenched disorder then permits studies of the model using the tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "we review in this section the crucial steps in the derivation of such spin models starting from standard ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functionals .",
    "we then discuss how the effect of impurities in the original gl theories can be taken into account in spin models .",
    "the idea of using a spin model for ferroelastic transitions was introduced in ref .",
    "this idea was later generalized to many other transitions and shown to capture the salient physics of continuum gl models  @xcite . for simplicity",

    "the landau free energy of the system is @xmath12 = e_0 \\int d^2 r \\left[f_l + f_g + f_{lr } \\right ] $ ] , where the local free energy for the first - order transition is @xmath13 , the gradient term @xmath14 , accounts for the cost of creating interfaces between different variants and @xmath15 is the elastic long - range force . the scaled temperature @xmath16 is expressed in terms of the transition temperature @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the temperature of the austenite stability limit .",
    "the long - range term comes from the so - called compatibility equation @xmath19 on the strain tensor @xmath20 , that ensures that the displacement field is single valued .",
    "this leads to the anisotropic kernel @xmath21 , which reads in fourier space @xmath22 the factor @xmath23 ensures that this long - range term vanishes for a uniform strain field . in all what follows , the ratio @xmath24 will be kept constant . back into real space",
    "we roughly have @xmath25 .",
    "the strain @xmath26 is the order parameter for this transition .",
    "the landau term @xmath13 ensures that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition at @xmath27 . when @xmath28 , this term has three minima , which correspond to phases called austenite ( @xmath29 ) and martensite ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the austenite is a metastable state . to obtain non - uniform textures ,",
    "one minimizes the gl functional @xmath12 $ ] as usual .",
    "note that at this stage the gl continuum model is in itself a mean - field description of the microscopic problem , and as such it does not contain any information about fluctuations around the mean - field solution given by the minimization of @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "an alternative point of view is to consider a formal partition function @xmath33 \\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\beta f[e_2]\\right)$ ] , where the strain configurations are summed over with a weight given by the usual boltzmann weight .",
    "the laudau ( or mean - field ) approximation is then nothing but a saddle point calculation of this functional integral .",
    "one can simplify the calculation of @xmath34 by retaining only the strain minima given by the landau part of @xmath35 , transforming then @xmath26 into a discrete variable that we rewrite as @xmath36 with the pseudospin @xmath37 .",
    "this is the main point of the pseudo - spin approximation , instead of keeping only one configuration which minimizes the full gl functional @xmath12 $ ] , we retain in the partition function all the configurations that minimize the local landau term @xmath13 . within this approximation ,",
    "the partition function reads @xmath38 , where the hamiltonian @xmath39 is obtained from the continuum theory as @xmath40 $ ] . after a proper discretization  @xcite",
    ", it reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the states @xmath46 correspond to the two rectangular variants while @xmath47 represents to the square austenite .",
    "note that this spin model only makes sense for @xmath48 , as for @xmath49 , only the state @xmath50 is allowed .",
    "we have therefore mapped our continuum gl theory onto a lattice spin@xmath51 model with hamiltonian  .",
    "this hamiltonian with @xmath52 is known in the spin literature as the blume - capel model  @xcite and it reproduces all the well - known features of the transition  @xcite , in particular , it has a first - order transition around @xmath53 .",
    "there are several points that are worth mentioning at this stage .",
    "it is usual to deduce gl theories from lattice models , not the other way around .",
    "the reason for this is that gl theories are easier to deal with and contain interesting coarse - grained , mean - field information about the initial microscopic model . in our case",
    ", we chose to start from a simplified gl theory to map onto a spin-@xmath54 statistical model that may seem harder to handle . on the other hand",
    ", spin models will turn out to be very convenient when introducing quenched disorder as connections to usual spin glass models can then be made  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to realize that when progressing from mean - field gl theory to a classical spin model we have actually put in additional information about thermal fluctuations , as the former _ a priori _ does not contain any information about fluctuations around the mean - field solution .",
    "the hamiltonian   is an _ effective _ model , with temperature - dependent coefficients and is _ not _ an accurate microscopic description of the phenomenon that we are studying .",
    "the additional information contained in the effective hamiltonian   is somehow arbitrary and other choices of reasonable hamiltonian would be possible .",
    "for example , one could as well have introduced two different temperatures , the physical temperature @xmath55 that would appear in @xmath56 , and another more artificial temperature @xmath57 that would appear in the boltzmann factor @xmath58 . as was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can then also let @xmath59 so that one would need to minimize @xmath39 in order to obtain statistical properties . we choose to introduce somewhat artificially thermal fluctuations by taking @xmath60 , a point of view completely analogous to what is usually done with the well known @xmath61 theory",
    "this is a crucial point when dealing with such effective spin models .",
    "now that we have seen how to model ferroelastics using spin models , we consider the influence of impurities in the model .",
    "our aim is to understand how quenched impurities affect the phase diagram of ferroelastic materials .",
    "this is usually done phenomenologically in laudau theory  @xcite by introducing a random field or by introducing randomness in the transition temperature @xmath18 with non - zero spatial correlations  @xcite . in this paper , we follow the idea that one need not worry about the precise microscopic form of the disorder induced by impurities as one expects the effect of quench disorder in the interactions of the model to yield somewhat universal features . recall that our spin model is an effective model , so the results we are after are generic features of the phase diagram , such as its topology , rather than an accurate , quantitative description to be compared directly with experiments .",
    "note that this train of thought is very similar to what was done in spin glass theory for usual ferromagnets ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the point is then to start from the pure ( disorder - free ) hamiltonian   and to take the nearest - neighbor couplings to be quench independent random variables @xmath62 , drawn from the distribution @xmath63 , with mean @xmath64 and with variance @xmath65 . as we will see later , the precise form of this distribution is irrelevant to the global topology of the phase diagram .",
    "this is a strong argument in favor of the `` universality '' discussed previously .",
    "we believe that this way of introducing disorder tends to be more satisfying than the very specific , sometimes fine - tuned , methods usually used in the literature .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 can be thought of as a measure of the quenched disorder in the system , in particular , for @xmath66 we recover a pure system . for future reference",
    ", we give the explicit form of our disordered hamiltonian @xmath67 where the couplings @xmath62 are quenched variables drawn from the distribution @xmath63 . in this paper",
    "we will use two different types of distributions    @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the following",
    ", the distribution   will be referred to as `` bimodal '' whereas we will denote   as gaussian .",
    "these equations define the model we will attempt to solve in the next section .",
    "we now consider how real - space renormalization - group ( rg ) can be used to compute the full phase diagram of the the spin model  .",
    "we also present preliminary monte carlo results and discuss their relationship to the phase diagram of the model .",
    "our goal in this section is to obtain an analytic phase diagram of the model defined by eq .   in the limit @xmath52 . from now on we will only take the limit of vanishing long - range interactions @xmath52 as we do not believe they are important to understand the phase diagram of ferroelastic materials .",
    "we will return to this later .",
    "there are several ways to deal with a hamiltonian such as  , an obvious straightforward method would be to perform a mean - field approximation .",
    "this yields ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a description in the context of martensitic transitions ) a first order phase transition at @xmath53 between a martensite phase with @xmath71 and an high - temperature austenite phase characterized by @xmath72 . here",
    "we choose a different , usually more reliable method : the real - space renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "its application to our pure spin-@xmath54 model goes back to ref .",
    "@xcite , and is of course well known .",
    "we review here some of the essential elements before proceeding to the case of disorder .",
    "the idea is to approximate the square lattice by a hierarchical lattice , obtained by iterating the construction scheme @xmath73{figrg1.png}\\ ] ] several other choices of hierarchical lattices to approximate the square lattice are possible , however the one we choose is known to be a very good approximation in the case of spin-@xmath54 models ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "we define our spin model on such a lattice by the hamiltonian @xmath74 .",
    "note that we expressed the crystal field term @xmath75 as a sum over the links instead of a sum over sites in order to take into account the fact that the coordination number of the sites in the lattice   is not constant .",
    "it is well - known that such precautions are needed when dealing with the renormalization of local field terms such as @xmath76 or specifically here @xmath77 .",
    "this corresponds to assigning weights to the sites in the crystal - field interaction term ( @xmath75 ) according to their coordination numbers which are , unlike the square lattice , not uniform .",
    "this inhomogeneity is necessary so that the square lattice is correctly approximated using a hierarchical lattice .",
    "on such a lattice , the partition function can be computed exactly by summing progressively over the spins .",
    "the renormalization procedure consists in decimating spins according to the scheme @xmath78{figrg2.png}\\ ] ] so that the renormalization process corresponds to inverting the arrows in eq .. more formally , if one denotes by @xmath79 the hamiltonian of the left - hand side of eq   and by @xmath80 its right - hand side , one has @xmath81 = \\mathrm{tr}\\ : \\mathrm{exp}\\left[-\\beta h_{1234}\\right ] , \\label{eqn : rgstepw}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 amounts for a partial summation performed on spins @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this equation then gives the relationship between @xmath79 and the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath85 , so that one can draw the evolution of the coupling parameters by repeating this decimation procedure .",
    "it is not hard to see that this transformation is exact if and only if one introduces an additional coupling @xmath86 that is generated upon renormalization .",
    "although this biquadratic interaction is absent in our original model , it is generated by the rg procedure , and must be taken into account to follow the exact rg flow . in our case , the elementary hamiltonian @xmath87 reads @xmath88   + \\frac{1}{4 } \\delta { \\ensuremath{\\sum\\limits}_{\\left\\langle i , j \\right\\rangle}^ { } } \\left [ { s_i}^2 + { s_j}^2\\right]$ ] , where the sum are performed over the links ( @xmath89,@xmath90,@xmath91,@xmath92,@xmath93 ) in eq .  .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that the additional coupling term @xmath94 must be introduced in the hamiltonian , otherwise there is no analytical solution to be found for eq .  .",
    "the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath95 then reads @xmath96 , where @xmath97 becomes a simple multiplying constant @xmath98 that contributes to the renormalization of the free energy , irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "it is straightforward to solve eq .   for all @xmath99,@xmath100 .",
    "this yields a non - linear map @xmath101 $ ] that gives the exact renormalized couplings of the effective hamiltonian @xmath102 in terms of the initial ones .",
    "iterating this map , one can obtain the effective hamiltonian describing the physics of the system at large scale , where the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system have been summed over .",
    "basins of attraction of this map correspond to thermodynamical phases , characterized by attractive fixed points .",
    "for example , the martensite phase ( ferromagnetic phase in the spin language ) has @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so at large scales the effective hamiltonian describing the system forces the spin to be in the @xmath105 states , with a strong correlations between nearest neighbors .",
    "meanwhile , austenite can be described by the attractive fixed point @xmath106 and @xmath107 so it corresponds to a disordered phase that favors @xmath50 . to obtain the phase diagram of our spin model   for @xmath52 , we simply iterate the map @xmath108 starting from the initial point @xmath109 .",
    "we find that the system flows to the martensite fixed point for @xmath110 , and to the austenite fixed point for @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , the study of the largest eigenvalue of the linearized renormalization - group matrix around the transition at @xmath112 can be used to prove that the transition is of first order  @xcite , as expected .",
    "the idea of using spin glass models to describe disordered ferroelastic materials originates from refs .",
    ". the replica / mean - field approach of this model  @xcite yields a strain glass phase but also several unwanted features that are contrary to both experiments and monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the absence of a tweed precursor is an example .",
    "we use here a different approach relying on real - space rg which we believe is simpler and usually more reliable .",
    "although our starting point is the same hamiltonian  , we will see in this paper that rg provides interesting new results that can be tested experimentally .",
    "the implementation of the rg procedure for disordered systems is very similar to the pure case in sec .",
    "[ subsecrgpure ] .",
    "the real - space rg in disordered systems still relies on a decimation procedure to progressively sum over the spin variables , integrating out the microscopic degrees of freedom ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . after each summation step ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the remaining degrees of freedom is assumed to be the same as the original one but with renormalized coupling coefficients .",
    "this turns out to be exact for the hierarchical lattice  .",
    "the only difference is that for disordered systems the rg allows us to follow the probability distribution of the couplings upon the renormalization procedure instead of the couplings themselves . in order to do so ,",
    "the main point is to obtain the rg equations in the case of a completely inhomogeneous system .",
    "even though the initial hamiltonian   ( with @xmath52 ) has pure @xmath113 and @xmath75 interactions , the rg flow will lead to randomness in all couplings , so one has to consider the more general hamiltonian @xmath114 .",
    "$ ] the initial condition for the rg flow is the hamiltonian   with @xmath52 , so that before renormalization , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "remark that we once again considered the crystal field term as living on the edges of the lattice , and not on the sites .",
    "this should be reminiscent of our treatment of the pure case in sec .",
    "[ subsecrgpure ] .",
    "the solution of eq .   in this case yields a map @xmath108 that gives the renormalized couplings @xmath118 in terms of the original ones @xmath119 .",

    "so there are 20 integrations to be performed at each rg step .",
    "we emphasize again that even though one starts from pure @xmath131 and @xmath75 couplings , randomness in these parameters will be generated by the rg procedure .",
    "similarly , even if one starts from a bimodal gaussian distribution for @xmath63 , the resulting distribution obtained after several renormalization steps could in principle be much more complicated .",

    "the hamiltonian   is believed to have a spin glass lower - critical dimension @xmath158 lying somewhere between 2 and 3 .",
    "this means that for @xmath159 ( low dimension ) , and in particular for @xmath160 , the spin glass phase should be destroyed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "meanwhile , it was recently proved  @xcite that the very same model ( forgetting about the temperature dependence of the coefficients ) has a spin glass phase at finite temperature in 3d .",

    "although one might think that the absence of spin glass phase in 2d could be of crucial importance experimentally , this is actually irrelevant to us , for the following reasons :    * even though a spin glass phase should not exist in 2d , we still expect kinetic features to make the system look `` glassy '' .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the monte carlo section below .",
    "the point is that the distinction in experiments and numerics between a genuine spin glass phase and a glassy kinematic behavior is actually a very subtle issue . *",
    "as our spin model was derived from a mean - field landau energy without thermal fluctuations , we are interested in generic ( mean - field like ) features of our model .",
    "this is a consequence of the discussion at the end of sec .  .",
    "the spin glass lower critical dimension is not a meaningful quantity in our case as our model was derived from a mean - field landau energy in the first place .",
    "therefore , the fact that the somewhat artificial fluctuations  introduced in going from the continuum gl theory to our spin model may or may not destroy the spin glass phase is not relevant , as these fluctuations do not exist in the original landau model .",
    "our model is thus only meaningful in a mean - field - like context .",
    "therefore , one need not worry about this issue of lower critical dimension here , it would be meaningful only if our spin model were a precise microscopic description of ferroelastics .",
    "although the direct numerical resolution of eq .   is the most straightforward way to proceed , it is also useful to have an approximate way of solving this system , thereby allowing one to perform the calculations analytically .",
    "a possibility to avoid this rather cumbersome numerical procedure is to make a further approximation in the case of bimodal disorder  .",
    "one can remark that rather than follow the full evolution of these distributions , one could enforce the renormalized distributions to be the same as the initial ones but with renormalized parameters .",
    "that is , we enforce the distribution of the @xmath62 couplings to remain bimodal upon renormalization , keeping @xmath131 and @xmath75 constant .",
    "although this approximation may appear too drastic , it is quite common in spin glass related problems and we will show in the following that it captures all the important features of the phase diagram of the model  .",
    "note that such an approximation typically yields results characteristic of higher - dimensional systems ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and thus should alter the spin glass lower critical dimension .",
    "as discussed previously , this is not important for our purposes . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this approximation as the `` projection approximation '' , as it indeed consists in projecting the renormalized distributions onto the initial ones .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows the phase diagram in the plane @xmath162 obtained by iterating the rg map in the projection approximation case . in the absence of disorder ( @xmath163 )",
    ", we find a first - order phase transition between the austenite and martensite phase with @xmath53 , as expected .",
    "as one increases the disorder , an intermediate tweed phase arises before it transforms into low temperature phase ( either martensite or strain glass ) . for large enough disorder and low temperature",
    ", we find a spin glass phase that we interpret as a strain glass .",
    "interestingly , when the disorder of the system is in the intermediate regime ( @xmath164 in our model ) , we find there should exist a spontaneous phase transition from strain glass to martensite , this is a prediction that was not obtained by previous numerical simulations  @xcite based on landau theory .",
    "the existence of a spin glass phase in this calculation is related to our projection approximation , which is known to produce results characteristic of higher - dimensional systems ( it is therefore legitimate to think of this approximation as a kind of mean field ) . note also that except for the spin - glass phase , the exact numerical resolutions of fig .",
    "[ figfullrg ] and the projection approximation results of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) are very much alike .",
    "we also present some preliminary monte carlo ( mc ) simulations that tend to confirm our rg results .",
    "we first note that one has to be very careful when doing mc simulations on a disordered system , in particular , one has to use algorithms that properly sample the configurations of the system , such as replica mc or parallel tempering  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these algorithms lose their full efficiency because the coefficients in our hamiltonian are temperature - dependent .",
    "we thus use a simplified simulated annealing algorithm , which we expect to yield reasonable results at least for small disorder .",
    "the algorithm is the analog of the steepest descent method used in the literature to minimize disordered gl functionals .",
    "we emphasize here that such minimization methods are often inadequate when dealing with spin - glass - like systems as the free - energy typically possesses many metastable minima .",
    "we first describe microstructure obtained in the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "fig  [ figmc ] ( a ) shows typical microstructures obtained in different regions of the phase diagram on a @xmath165 lattice , with the strength of the long - range term of @xmath166",
    ". these textures are fully consistent with what is observed in continuum gl theories and in experiments .",
    "in particular , we find the usual cross - hatched pattern for the tweed phase .",
    "nevertheless , our rg approach provides a clear meaning to the tweed phase , even in the absence of long - range interactions .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ figmc ] ( b ) field - cooling / zero - field - cooling results ( fc / zfc ) that are usually used in both numerical studies and experiments to test for breaking of ergodicity and glassiness . these curves were obtained by averaging over @xmath167 disordered configurations on @xmath168 lattices , other lattice sizes were tested without much difference .",
    "the curves shown in fig .  [ figmc ] ( b ) may be interpreted as a signature of history dependence or ergodicity breaking . however , as argued previously , we do not expect the 2d version of the hamiltonian   to have a spin - glass phase .",
    "the word `` spin - glass '' should be understood here in the technical sense of the term , this does not prevent the system from showing kinematic `` glassy behaviors '' in the sense sometimes used by experimentalists . therefore , our zfc / fc results should be interpreted as a pure kinematic effect , possibly related to the slow convergence of our mc algorithm .",
    "similar problems should occur when minimizing gl disordered functionals thanks to naive steepest descent algorithms .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that probing spin - glass phases in usual spin models is a very subtle question to address numerically , and this can not be answered using simple zfc / fc experiments .",
    "finally , we suggest that the main features of our phase diagram persist even in the presence of long - range interactions ( see related discussions in refs  @xcite ) . the influence of the elastic long - range interaction on the austenite / tweed and tweed / strain glass transition temperatures is shown schematically in fig .  [ figmc](3 ) . for no disorder ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the austenite / martensite transition temperature decreases linearly with @xmath169 , as included phenomenologically within landau theory .",
    "all the transition temperatures decrease with @xmath169 , in particular the glass transition is shifted to lower temperatures because the long range interactions compete with the randomness  @xcite . in the asymptotic limit @xmath170 ,",
    "the disorder becomes irrelevant and only the austenite phase remains ; we therefore conjecture that the phase diagram is shifted to lower temperatures with increasing @xmath169 .",
    "this result could have implications in the study of colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) materials where the interplay of disorder and long - range strain mediated interactions has a bearing on phase separation of coexisting insulating and conducting phases  @xcite .",
    "we now put our work focused on the 2d sr transition in a more general context and explain how one can extend the results to more realistic situations .",
    "although our rg analysis is in 2d and is for a square to rectangle transition ( sr ) , we do not expect the salient features of the phase diagram to change for other transitions in 2d or 3d . as an example , let us discuss how one can extend our approach to the 3d cubic to tetragonal transition ( ct ) . a spin model for this transition",
    "was already proposed in ref .",
    "the ct transition is described in terms of a two - dimensional order parameter ( op ) given by the adjunction of both deviatoric and shear distortions @xmath171 .",
    "the free energy functional can be written as a sum of 3 terms , @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "the ginzburg term reads @xmath173 , whereas @xmath174 is a long - range part that shall not be important here ( its explicit expression can be found in ref .",
    "the landau part is slightly more complicated @xmath175 .",
    "this free energy can be minimized with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath176 , leading to four minima for @xmath177 .",
    "let alone the @xmath178 minimum , the three other ones are given in the complex plane by @xmath179 , with @xmath180 , and where similarly to the 2d case , one introduces @xmath181 one can observe that @xmath182 now corresponds to the upper spinodal . retaining the landau minima in the free energy @xmath183 , we define a pseudospin @xmath184 such that @xmath185 , with @xmath186 the landau part of the free energy hence reduces to @xmath187 where @xmath188 this leads to the pseudospin model @xmath189 with @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 defined as before .",
    "this model is a three - dimensional clock model with long - range interactions .",
    "the two - dimensional spin @xmath184 can take 3 values on the unit circle in addition of the value @xmath193 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the renormalization group method to this class of models .",
    "this is done by considering hierarchical lattices with fractal dimension close to 3 , for which the rg decimation step becomes exact if one introduces an additional coupling @xmath194 .",
    "we solved exactly the pure model defined by eq .",
    "for @xmath52 , on a three - dimensional hierarchical lattice to find two phases separated by a first order phase transition around @xmath53 , as expected .",
    "the high - temperature austenite phase is characterized by @xmath195 , whereas the martensite phase shows one of the three variants lying on the circle @xmath196 .",
    "quench disorder can be easily introduced through random @xmath62 couplings and the rg iteration can be generalized to the disordered case .",
    "the calculated phase diagram is very similar to that obtained for sr in 2d in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , although the numerical resolution of the rg equations is much more difficult in this case . we find two different `` paraelastic '' phases , the usual austenite characterized by the rg fixed point ( @xmath106 , @xmath148 ) , and a tweed fixed point with ( @xmath106 , @xmath149 ) which corresponds to a disordered phase of martensitic variants .",
