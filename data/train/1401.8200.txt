    "the recent availability of an unprecedented amount of data has made possible quantitative studies of cities  @xcite , opening the way to a science of cities . in particular , the discovery of allometric scaling relationships in cities has driven the quantitative research on urban systems in the past years . indeed , there is a great amount of evidence to show that different socio - economic indicators in cities , such as the gdp , the crime rate , the number of patents as well as different structural indicators such as the total length of the road network , the urbanized land area , etc . , exhibit robust scaling relationships with respect to population  @xcite .",
    "the existence of these simple scaling relationship hints at the existence of universal processes shared by urban systems , and thus at the possibility of modeling cities . + a common trait shared by all complex systems including cities is the existence of a large variety of processes occuring over a wide range of time and spatial scales .",
    "the main obstacle to the understanding of these systems therefore resides in uncovering the hierarchy of processes and in singling out the few ones which govern their dynamics .",
    "albeit difficult , the hierarchisation of processes is of prime importance .",
    "a failure to do so leads to models which are either too complex to give any real insight into the phenomenon , or too simple and abstract to have any resemblance with reality . as a matter of fact , despite numerous attempts  @xcite , a theoretical understanding of many observed empirical regularities in cities is still missing .",
    "+ in the present study , we show that the spatial structure of the mobility pattern controls the behaviour of many quantities in urban systems .",
    "indeed , cities are not only defined by the spatial organisation of places fulfilling different functions shops , places of residence , workplaces , etc. but also by the way indivduals move among them . understanding where people live ,",
    "where and how they travel within the city thus appears as a necessary step towards a scientific theory of cities .",
    "+ although an increasing amount of data about mobility is now available  @xcite , we still lack a simple model explaining the dominant mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of mobility patterns .",
    "many factors such as geographical constraints , facilities location and available transportation to name a few can impact the mobility and it thus appears as an intricate issue . here , we tackle the problem of mobility by making simplifying yet not simple assumptions , trying to grasp the most important parameters which define the problem .",
    "we thus build upon a simple out - of - equilibrium model previously developed  @xcite .",
    "this model , among other things , accounts for the polycentric transition of cities and gives a prediction for the number of centers as a function of population .",
    "we show that this framework allows us to predict the behaviour of many quantities related to mobility and the structure of cities : the scaling with population of the total time wasted in congestion , transport related @xmath0 emissions , total travelled distance , total lane miles and surface area .",
    "our results allow us give a quantitative insight into two important debates around urban systems .",
    "first , we are able to discuss the benefits of polycentricity and quantify some of its aspects",
    ". then , maybe more importantly , we are able to put into perspective the sustainability of urban systems .",
    "we start by presenting some naive arguments to estimate the scaling exponents for the area @xmath1 , the total daily distance driven @xmath2 and the total lane miles @xmath3 .",
    "although these predictions turn out to be wrong , naive scalings are useful as a first approach to the problem as they allow us understand how the different quantities relate to one another .      first , we would like to estimate the dependence of the area @xmath1 of a city on its population @xmath4 a long standing problem in the field  @xcite .",
    "a first crude approach would be to assume that cities evolve in such a way that their population density @xmath5 remains constant .",
    "this assumption straighforwardly implies that the area should scale linearly with population @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the average surface occupied by each individual ( the assumption of a constant density is then equivalent to the one of a constant average surface per capita ) .",
    "we would now like to estimate the total length @xmath3 of all the roads within a city .",
    "if we consider that the network formed by streets is such that all the nodes ( intersections ) are connected to their closest neighbour , the typical length of a road segment is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the number of intersections .",
    "previous studies of road networks in different regions , and over extended time periods  @xcite , have shown that the number of intersections is proportional to the population size .",
    "therefore , the typical length of a road segment ( between two intersections ) varies with the population size @xmath4 as @xmath10 and the total length of the network @xmath11 should then scale as @xmath12 using the naive scaling for the dependence of @xmath1 on population size given previously in eq .",
    "[ eq : area_naive ] we finally get @xmath13      [ [ individual - constraint ] ] individual constraint + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we would also like to estimate the total commuting distance @xmath2 . the first constraint on this distance comes from individuals s limitations and behaviour .",
    "we make here the simple assumption that individuals choose their residence and work place such that their total commuting distance is fixed ( or at least smaller than a certain value ) and equal on average to @xmath14 . in that case , we would simply have @xmath15 ( by constant , we mean independent from the population size of the city ) .",
    "[ [ the - city - structure - constraint ] ] the city structure constraint + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    an additional contraint on @xmath2 is given by the structure of the city  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the individual commuting distance is also related to the total suface area of the city and the location of activity centers .",
    "if we first assume that the city is monocentric , individuals are all commuting to the same center and the typical commuting distance @xmath16 is controlled by the typical size of the city of order @xmath17 @xmath18    on the other hand , if we assume that the city is completely decentralized , the typical commuting distance is of order the nearest neighbour distance @xmath19 , and we obtain @xmath20      the comparison of the naive exponents with the exponents measured on us data is shown in table 1 ( see the methods section for details about the data ) .",
    "there are important discrepancies , which we discuss in the following .",
    "first , we note that the naive scaling for the surface area @xmath1 predicts a value of the exponent that is quantitatively and worse , qualitatively different from that observed .",
    "indeed , we find that for real cities @xmath21 with @xmath22 . while the naive argument implies a linear dependence of the surface area @xmath1 with population",
    ", we find a sublinear scaling in the data , which is a qualitatively different behavior ( table  [ table : naive ] ) .",
    "this disagreement on this basic quantity will naturally impact the scaling of the other quantities .",
    "the data also show that @xmath23 can be considered reasonably independent from @xmath4 ( with a value of approximately @xmath24 miles for the us , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ltotoverp ] ) , in agreement with the individual constraint assumption ( eq . [ eq : assum ] ) .",
    "this finding is also in agreement with the results drawn from census data in germany by  @xcite .",
    "although this assumption of a constant distance is simple and verified on the us data , we think that it deserves to be systematically tested on other datasets for other countries and cities .",
    "miles , and the standard deviation @xmath25 miles.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    finally , the scaling of @xmath26 given in the extreme cases of a monocentric city structure and a totally decentralized city structure disagree with the value measured on data ( see table  [ table : naive ] ) .",
    "this suggests that most cities have a structure that is neither completely centralized , nor totally decentralized . in particular , this result cast some doubts about the study @xcite which assumes implicitely that cities are always monocentric .",
    "any situation between the two previous extreme cases would give a scaling of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "one can easily see that this expression is consistent with that of @xmath29 and @xmath23 if @xmath30 which is indeed what we observe empirically ( up to error bars ) .",
    "this preliminary analysis thus leads us to the conclusion that , in order to compute the various exponents , we need to better describe the structure of commuting patterns . in other words",
    ", we need to find a description of cities that goes beyond the naive monocentric or totally decentralized views , and which accounts for the observed sub - linear scaling of the surface area @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the assumption that mobility patterns are mostly driven by the daily commuting and we would like to understand how an individual , given his household location , will choose his job location .",
    "we assume that this choice will be determined by two dominant factors : the expected wage at a given job , and the commuting time to this job s location .",
    "indeed , places with high average salaries are attractive , but having to spend a sensible amount of time commuting every day is less desirable .",
    "we assume there are @xmath31 potential activity centers in the city , each characterized by an average wage @xmath32 at location @xmath33 .",
    "this wage is endogenously determined and depends a priori on many factors such as agglomeration effects  @xcite , the type of industry , etc .",
    "although it is in principle possible to write down equations to determine the wage ( as attempted in  @xcite for instance ) , not only is it impossible to solve them , but also not necessarily useful .",
    "a similar situation arises in physics when one studies the behaviour of atoms made of a large number of electrons .",
    "physicists found out  @xcite that , in fact , a statistical description of these systems relying on random matrices could lead to predictions which agree with experimental results .",
    "we would like to import this idea of replacing a complex quantity such as wages which depends on so many factors and interactions by a random one in spatial economics .",
    "so , we treat the wage _ as if _ it was exogenous and random  @xcite , that is we write @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the typical income in this city and @xmath36 is a random number chosen uniformly in @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the commuting time does not only depend on the distance between the two places , but also on the traffic @xmath38 between those two locations .",
    "an individual living at @xmath39 will thus commute to the center @xmath33 which corresponds to the best trade - off between income and commuting time , thus to the center @xmath33 such that the quantity @xmath40\\ ] ] is maximum  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is the euclidean distance between @xmath39 and @xmath33 ( both supposed to be scattered randomly across the city ) , @xmath42 the total incoming traffic at @xmath33 , @xmath43 the capacity of the underlying transportation network , and @xmath44 is an exponent describing the sensitivity of the network to congestion .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is the maximum distance that people can financially travel daily , defined as the ratio between the typical individual income and the transportation costs per unit of distance . + this",
    "simple model displays a surprisingly rich behaviour  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it accounts for the monocentric to polycentric transition observed in most cities .",
    "it has been a well - known fact for quite some time that as cities grow , they evolve from a monocentric organisation where all the activities are concentrated in the same geographical area usually the central business district to a more distributed , polycentric organisation  @xcite .",
    "several theories in spatial economics exist  @xcite , but are not satisfactory for many reasons . among other things",
    ", they do not take congestion into account and have no predictive , testable content  @xcite . within this framework",
    ", congestion is actually responsible for the transition , and the number of activity centers in a city of population size @xmath4 is on average given by @xmath46 with @xmath47    using data of employment per zip code area in the us  @xcite , we showed that    @xmath48    where we measure @xmath49 ( @xmath50 confidence interval ( ci ) ) .",
    "in other words , the number of centers scales sublinearly with population size .            at this stage ,",
    "the number of centers is a function of population and the area    @xmath51    and we need an additional equation in order to get a closed system .",
    "here we focus on the area and its evolution with the population size , which reflects the growth process of the city . in the following",
    ", we will investigate two different approaches .",
    "it is worth noting that both approaches give results in qualitative agreement , showing that some stylized facts such as super- or sublinearity are very robust .",
    "+    [ [ fitting - procedure . ] ] fitting procedure .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the absence of knowledge of the processes responsible for urban sprawl , we can assume that the area behaves as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the exponent to be determined , through fits on data .",
    "the empirical value for the exponent for the us data is @xmath54 .",
    "once this exponent is given we can then compute the various exponent for the quantities of interest ( see the following and table 2 ) .",
    "we get for the number of centers @xmath55    @xmath56    which is sublinear as long as @xmath57 , in agreement with the empirical results for us cities . as we will see , this approach yields the same qualitative behaviours as those predicted with the method of the next section .",
    "in other words , even if the main mechanism behind urban sprawl is not congestion , the conclusions of this paper are not affected as long as the area scales _ sublinearly _ with population .",
    "+    [ [ coherent - growth . ] ] coherent growth .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us now assume that the scaling of @xmath1 with population is determined by the number of activity centers and the constant commuting length of individuals .",
    "this means that the growth of the area is controlled by the appearance of new activity centers .",
    "if we assume that a city is organized around @xmath55 activity centers and that the attraction basin of each of these centers are spatially separated  @xcite , we then have @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the area of each subcenter s attraction basin .",
    "this area @xmath59 is related to the average individual commuting distance by @xmath60 , and we obtain @xmath61 this leads to expression for the number of centers @xmath62    which is always smaller than @xmath63 , also in agreement with the empirical results for us cities .",
    "we can now also compute the scaling of the surface area @xmath64 we further assume that @xmath65 is a fraction of the longest possible journey @xmath45 individuals can afford , that is to say @xmath66 it is important to note that if @xmath67 is independent from @xmath45 , the quantitative predictions of our model would still hold . the final expression for the area",
    "is then here given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the exponent @xmath70 is smaller than @xmath71 whatever @xmath72 , which implies that the density of cities increases _ sublinearly _ with population . in other words ,",
    "the density of cities _ increases _ with population .",
    "we verify this prediction in table 2 , with data about land area of urbanized areas in the us ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we find @xmath73 which is not too far from the theoretical value @xmath74 , equal to @xmath75 in this case .    because the area of an urban system results from centuries of evolution , we do not a priori expect our model where individual vehicles are assumed to be the only vector of mobility to give a prediction valid for all countries and all times",
    "nevertheless , these results give us reasons to believe that the spatial structure of the journey - to - work commuting should still be the dominant factor in the dependence of land area on population .      using eq .",
    "[ eq : assum ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : area ] we are now able to compute @xmath26 @xmath76 we plot @xmath77 for urbanized areas in the us on figure 2 , and one can check in table 2 that the exponent predicted from the previously measured value of @xmath75 agrees well with the exponent measured on the data . in the fitting case , the exponent would simply be given by @xmath78 .",
    "if we use the previously derived expression for the area @xmath1 , we find @xmath79 the quantity @xmath70 is less than @xmath71 , which implies that @xmath3 scales _ sublinearly _ with the city s population size .",
    "in other words , larger cities need less roads per capita than smaller ones : we recover the fact that agglomeration of people in urban centers involves economies of scale for infrastructures . within the fitting assumption ( eq.[eq : fit ] ) , we would obtain @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately , agglomeration in cities does not only generate economies .",
    "congestion , for instance , is a major diseconomy associated with the concentration of people in a given area .",
    "a simple way to quantify the impairement caused by traffic congestion is through the total delay it generates .",
    "if we make the first order approximation that the average free - flow speed @xmath81 is the same for everyone , the total delay due to congestion is given according to our model by @xmath82 if we assume that all the centers share the same number of commuters a reasonable assumption within our model  @xcite we obtain @xmath83 which , using the expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath1 given in eq .  [ eq : travelled_length ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : area ] respectively , gives @xmath84    the total commuting time corresponding to the same distance but without congestion scales as @xmath85 and thus less rapidly than the total delay which scales _ super - linearly _ with population ( even when polycentricity is taken into account ) .",
    "this means that , for the largest cities , delays due to congestion actually dominate the time spent in traffic , and that economical losses _ per capita _ due to the time lost in congestion and the corresponding strain on people s life increase with the size of the city .    in the fitting assumption eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] , and using the same arguments for the calculation of @xmath86 , we easily obtain for the exponent the value @xmath87 .",
    "another diseconomy associated with congestion is the quantity of @xmath0 emitted by cars and the gasoline consumed by motor vehicles .",
    "this amount not only depends on the distance that has been driven , but also on the traffic during the journey .",
    "it indeed turns out that for the same length driven , a car burns more oil when the traffic is heavy than when the road is clear . within our model , the presence of traffic is seen in the time spent to cover a given distance , and we write that the quantity of @xmath0 emitted by a vehicle is proportional to the total time spent in traffic , leading to @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the average quantity of @xmath0 produced per unit time . in the polycentric case with @xmath90 subcenters ,",
    "the typical trip length @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 and we obtain @xmath93\\ ] ] the first term in brackets is a constant , and the quantity of @xmath0 is thus dominated by congestion effects at large populations @xmath94 and the total daily transport - related @xmath0 emission per capita thus scales as @xmath95 the quantity of @xmath0 emitted per capita in cities thus increases with the size of the city , a consequence of congestion .",
    "this prediction agrees with the exponent we measure ( figure 3 ) on data gathered for us and oecd cities ( data about the area and population of urbanised areas can be found on the census bureau website @xcite , data about congestions in urban areas can be found in the urban mobility report @xcite , and data about the total lane miles and the daily total miles driven in urbanized areas can be found on on the federal highway administration website @xcite ) .",
    "we are aware that the scaling of @xmath0 with population size is controversial , with results varying from one study to another .",
    "although a systematic meta - analysis of these results is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the authors of  @xcite are concerned with the total emissions of @xmath0 , while this paper is only concerned with emissions due to transportations",
    ". moreover , our prediction agrees well with the exponent of @xmath96 measured by the authors of  @xcite on the same dataset , but with a different definition of cities .",
    "finally , our prediction also agrees with measurements made in @xcite for developing countries .",
    "emissions due to transport with city size . in blue ,",
    "excess @xmath0 ( in tons ) due to congestion , as given by the urban mobility report ( 2010 ) for 101 metropolitan areas in the us  @xcite . in green , we show the estimated @xmath0 emissions ( in tons ) due to transports , as given by the oecd for 268 metropolitan areas in 28 different countries ( data about the total @xmath0 emissions due to transportation in major metropolitan area in the oecd can be found online  @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed yellow lines represent the least - square fit assuming a power - law dependency with multiplicative noise , which gives respectively @xmath97 for the us data and @xmath98 for the oecd data . ]",
    "another important related quantity is the the consumption of gasoline which in principle is proportional to the emission of @xmath0 and the time spent driving .",
    "the total daily gasoline consumption is then given by @xmath99 where @xmath89 is the average quantity of gasoline needed per unit time .",
    "from this expression , we see that the total daily gasoline consumption per capita scales as @xmath100 and is therefore not a simple function of the city density , in contrast with what was suggested by the seminal paper of newman and kenworthy  @xcite . at this stage however , more data about gasoline consumption is needed to test this prediction and draw definitive conclusions .",
    "although polycentricity emerges naturally from our model as a result of congestion , many circumstances can prevent or foster the appearance of new activity centers in a city .",
    "there are many debates as to whether policies should favour polycentric or monocentric developpement of cities .",
    "most of them are based on ideologies and opinions about how cities should be , very few are based on a quantitative understanding of the city as a complex system .",
    "although this only represents a small part of the debate , our model allows to quantify the effect of polycentricity on the total delay due to congestion .",
    "we can indeed compute the total delay due to congestion in the case of a monocentric configuration .",
    "in this situation , all the population commutes to a single destination @xmath63 and we have @xmath101 it follows , using the expression given above for @xmath2 @xmath102 from the fact that @xmath103 , we indeed find that the total delay due to congestion is worse for monocentric cities than it is for polycentric cities with the same population , which agrees with the usual intuition .",
    "more precisely the ratio of delays is given by @xmath104 where the exponent is of order @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , even though diseconomies associated with polycentric cities scale superlinearly with population , it would be even worse if we did not let cities evolve from the monocentric case .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the consumption of gasoline and the @xmath0 emissions .",
    "this suggests that , everything else being equal , polycentricity should be favoured for quality of life and environmental reasons .     and see how indicators change when we compare it with a system with many cities and the same total population .",
    "( a ) variation of the yearly delay per capita due to congestion with the number of cities ( normalised by the value @xmath106 corresponding to the single city case ) .",
    "( b ) evolution of the infrastructure length with the number of cities ( normalised by the value @xmath107 corresponding to the single city case ) .",
    "relative gains in terms of commuting time per person decrease faster than infrastructure costs increase , suggesting that life in cities could be improved at a relatively low cost by decentralisation . ]",
    "also , given the superlinear behaviour of the diseconomies associated with living in cities , it is clear that we would be better off living in several smaller cities rather than a single huge city .",
    "however , due to the economies of scale realised in large cities , we can wonder whether this is also economically reasonable .",
    "if we assume that the total cost of a city of population @xmath4 is the sum of its infrastructure cost and the economical losses due to congestion we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the average cost of a kilometer of roads , @xmath110 the average hourly wage and @xmath111 the planning horizon in years ( this expression is not exhaustive , as the costs dues to @xmath0 emissions and gasoline consumptions are not included ) .",
    "the infrastructure needs maintenance , and its cost depends on the planning horizon as well and can be written @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the construction cost in @xmath114 and @xmath115 the maintenance cost in @xmath116 .",
    "we assume that the population @xmath4 is distributed among @xmath117 cities of the same size @xmath118 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the total lane miles for the @xmath117 cities reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the total lane for one city .",
    "the total congestion delay for @xmath117 cities is @xmath121 and we thus obtain the total cost @xmath122 for @xmath117 cities @xmath123\\ ] ] the number of cities @xmath124 which minimises the total cost is obtained when @xmath125 , leading to ( for @xmath126 ) @xmath127 ^ 2\\ ] ] ( the actual number of cities is of course an integer , and can be taken as the nearest integer from @xmath124 for instance ) .",
    "it is then economically advantageous to divide the population in several cities if @xmath128 . to illustrate this point",
    ", we compute the number of cities which would minimise the cost for a world population @xmath129 .",
    "the world bank estimates the maintenance cost of roads to be of the order of @xmath130 , and the average hourly wage to be of the order of @xmath131 , the value of @xmath70 is taken from the measures on us data , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath134 which gives an average city size of @xmath135 .",
    "this result is to put in perspective with the fact that the world hosts @xmath136 or so cities with over @xmath137 inhabitants and that this number is still increasing .",
    "the previous results assume that we split a large city into many cities of the same size .",
    "the cities are however organized in various sizes distributed according to something that can be approximated by a pareto distribution , as known since zipf s work  @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear why we observe such a convergence  @xcite .",
    "we propose here a new perspective to this debate by asking : assuming cities are distributed according to a pareto distribution , what value of the exponent minimises the overall cost ? indeed from above the total cost for a population size @xmath138 is given at large times by @xmath139 we assume that the population is distributed according to @xmath140\\ ] ] with @xmath141 and a cut - off population @xmath142 ( which is at most equal to the world s population ) .",

    "we obtain the following equation @xmath148 and in the limit @xmath142 we obtain the optimal value for @xmath149 @xmath150 numerically , @xmath151 and @xmath152 , leading to @xmath153 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value would lead to a rank - plot exponent ( @xmath154 ) not far from those measured on different countries around the world  @xcite .",
    "although we do not pretend that the above reasoning provides a definitive answer to the zipf puzzle , it nevertheless suggests that the broad diversity of population might derive from economical considerations , and that there may be a connection between the zipf law exponent and optimality considerations .",
    "the superlinear increase of congestion delay with population , and thereby of gasoline consumption and of @xmath0 emissions , has terrible consequences on the economy , the environment , health and well - being .",
    "the outlook is nothing short of grim in our ever - urbanising world .",
    "as the proportion of human beings living in cities dramatically increases the un expects the world population to be @xmath155 urban in 2050  @xcite wages are likely to increase  @xcite but not enough to compensate for the negative effects of congestion . as a result , if the individual car stays the dominant transportation mode , cities will put more strain on people s life , while acting as catalysts for the production of @xmath0 greenhouse gas , responsible for an overall increase of the planet s temperature  @xcite .",
    "it is currently believed that advantages associated with living in a large city outweigh the costs .",
    "our results reveal however the existence of very rapidly growing problems such as congestion and @xmath0 emissions , which inevitably begs the question of the sustainability of large cities . it might be time to cut down considerably the use of individual vehicles , or to consider the possibility of living in smaller or medium sized cities : the infrastructure costs ( @xmath3 ) may be larger , but the impact on the environment ( @xmath0 emissions ) and on the well - being of people ( delays in congestion ) would be beneficial ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the most striking fact about the above results is that despite the apparence of complexity that is conveyed by cities , most of their structure can be explained by the very simple and universal desire for the best achievable balance between income and commuting costs .",
    "our model unifies mobility patterns , spatial structure of cities and allometric scalings in a framework that can be built upon .",
    "more work is needed in order to integrate information about firm locations , the influence of public transportation on mobility patterns  @xcite , the effect of the integration of cities into urban systems  @xcite , to understand the fluctuations around the average trends , and to test the validity of the model on different sets of data .",
    "we believe however that the results presented here represent a crucial step towards a scientific understanding of cities .",
    "as recently stressed in  @xcite , when trying to identify patterns accross cities , one must be careful and consistent in the definition of city boundaries .",
    "these authors indeed found out that the scaling exponents measures for several quantities are usually sensitive to the definition chosen for the city . in order to make our results reproducible , we detail in the following the data source and the corresponding city definition .",

    "it is interesting to note that the dependence of the surface area of metropolitan statistical areas with population is a lot less clear - cut , implying that , with respect to surface area , the definition of uas delineates more coherent systems than the definition of msas .",

    "interestingly , while we have assumed a constant @xmath45 throughout this paper , we have noticed that its effect on the different scalings was not negligible ( compare the results for @xmath3 and @xmath1 between table 1 and table 2 for instance ) , implying that @xmath45 has a small , yet non - zero dependence on the population .",

    "indeed , when data were available for both msa and urban area , we found out that the msa data did not exhibit as clear - cut regularities as the urban area data did .",

    "<S> the recent availability of data for cities has allowed scientists to exhibit scalings which present themselves in the form of a power - law dependence on population of various socio - economical and structural indicators . </S>",
    "<S> we propose here a stochastic theory of urban growth which accounts for some of the observed scalings and we confirm these predictions on us and oecd empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the dependence on population size of the total number of miles driven daily , the total length of the road network , the total traffic delay , the total consumption of gasoline , the quantity of @xmath0 emitted and the relation between area and population of cities , are all governed by a single parameter which characterizes the sensitivity to congestion . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that diseconomies associated with congestion scale superlinearly with population size , implying that despite polycentrism cities whose transportation infrastructure rely heavily on traffic sensitive modes are unsustainable . </S>"
