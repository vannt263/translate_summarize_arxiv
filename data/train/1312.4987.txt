    "most of the literature on tiling spaces and their dynamical systems has focused on those with finite local complexity ( flc ) . in this paradigm",
    "there is a finite set @xmath0 of tiles called ` prototiles ' , congruent copies of which are used to cover the plane ( or @xmath1 ) without gaps or overlaps . moreover , the adjacencies between tiles are restricted so that there are only finitely many two - tile configurations . if there can be infinitely many two - tile configurations in a tiling , then that tiling is said to have infinite local complexity ( ilc ) .    when tilings are looked at from a physical perspective it makes sense to consider not just individual tilings but rather spaces whose elements are tilings that share some common properties .",
    "these tiling spaces are given a metric topology where the distance between two tilings is defined by how similar they are in balls around the origin ( see section [ metric.section ] for precision ) .",
    "when there are only finitely many two - tile configurations that are found in any tiling of a tiling space , we say that the tiling space itself has finite local complexity ; otherwise , it has infinite local complexity .",
    "flc tiling spaces have been the standard objects used to model the atomic structure of crystals and quasicrystals and have proved quite effective in the study of statistical properties , diffraction patterns , and energy spectra of aperiodic solids .",
    "a tiling space that is of finite local complexity can be homeomorphic to one with infinite local complexity @xcite .",
    "thus finite local complexity is not a topological invariant and should not be considered an intrinsic property when topological methods are used to study aperiodic tilings .",
    "examples of tilings with infinite local complexity have appeared sporadically @xcite , and it is increasingly clear that the class is nt as unnatural as previously imagined .",
    "moreover , most of the ` usual ' flc tools and techniques can be used in the ilc case , and one of the goals of this chapter is to explain exactly how to adapt the existing machinery .",
    "we take as fundamental the requirement that prototiles come from _",
    ", not necessarily finite , sets .",
    "this means that both the ` supports ' of the tiles ( i.e. , their underlying sets in @xmath1 ) and the ` labels ' of the tiles ( which are used to distinguish tiles with congruent supports ) must come from compact sets .",
    "we will see that this fundamental requirement means that ilc tiling spaces are compact ( see section [ tilingspaces.sec ] ) .",
    "we delay formal definitions until section [ sec : tiling.defs ] and provide some informal examples now .",
    "since one - dimensional tiles are closed intervals , any tiling made from a finite number of interval lengths with a finite number of labels must have finite local complexity .",
    "so in order to have infinite local complexity in one dimension there must be either an infinite label set or an infinite number of lengths ( or both ) .",
    "a first example is to allow tiles to take lengths from some closed interval , for instance we could require that @xmath2 length @xmath3 .",
    "we can let the support of a prototile @xmath4 be the interval @xmath5 $ ] , and we can label the tile by its length , @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to omit the label when it is possible to tell tiles apart by their supports , as is the case here , but we are including them for consistency with the definitions provided in section [ sec : tiling.defs ] .",
    "the prototile @xmath4 is formally the pair @xmath7,x)$ ] , and the prototile set in this example is thus @xmath8\\}$ ] .",
    "notice that the set of supports of prototiles is compact in the hausdorff metric and the set of labels is compact in the usual distance metric in @xmath9 .",
    "importantly , if a sequence of prototiles has a convergent label sequence , then their supports converge as well .",
    "this makes it possible to say that the sequence of prototiles themselves converge .",
    "a tile is simply a translate of @xmath4 by some element @xmath10 ; we write @xmath11,x)$ ] .",
    "( note that translation changes the support of a tile but not its label . )",
    "we could make a tiling from such tiles in any number of ways , for instance by generating a sequence of random numbers in @xmath12 $ ] and laying down tiles of those lengths in any order . with probability one",
    "such a tiling will have infinite local complexity because it has infinitely many different tiles and thus has infinitely many different two - tile patterns .",
    "this example provides a nice test case for computation since it is really different than the standard flc situation , but still quite simple .",
    "example [ variable.size.example ] consists of a hierarchical tiling space based on a prototile set derived from @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce its construction in section [ substitution ] and give it a thorough analysis in section [ vss.analysis ] .    for another one - dimensional example we take a single interval length for the supports but allow for infinitely many labels .",
    "suppose that the support of every prototile is @xmath13 $ ] , but that each prototile takes a label from some compact label set @xmath14 . for concreteness ,",
    "let @xmath15 , the unit circle .",
    "we can not tell two prototiles apart by their supports , so the label tells us when two of them are different , and the distance between their labels tells us how different they are .    an interesting way to construct a tiling from this prototile set is to fix an element @xmath16 consider the sequence of labels @xmath17 for any @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 is irrational then the tilings generated by this label sequence will have infinite local complexity since @xmath20 is infinite ( and in fact uniformly distributed ) .",
    "a two - dimensional example of an ilc tiling can be constructed from unit squares .",
    "tile the plane in rows of tiles , but offset each row from the next by a randomly chosen number in [ 0,1 ] . with probability one , the result will be an ilc tiling .",
    "a non - random variation on this theme is to base the offsets on some fixed irrational number @xmath19 .",
    "lay the first row of squares along the @xmath6-axis with a vertex at the origin .",
    "place an endpoint of the row at height @xmath21 at @xmath22 , and the endpoint of the row at height @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath20 is uniformly distributed in @xmath13 $ ] , the offsets between rows will be too and in this way form an ilc tiling of the plane .",
    "a well - known example that has infinite local complexity up to translations is the pinwheel tiling .",
    "pinwheel tiles appear in infinitely many orientations in any individual pinwheel tiling and so there are not finitely many different two - tile patches that are translates of one another .",
    "this is a borderline case , however : the tiles fit together in finitely many ways even though these allowed configurations appear in infinitely many orientations .",
    "it is sometimes useful , then , to consider the pinwheel tiling space to be of finite local complexity by allowing rotations along with translations .      in higher dimensions",
    "there are many natural examples of tilings with infinite local complexity .",
    "for instance , the atomic structure of an ideal crystal is modeled by a lattice of points , but the atoms in an actual crystal appear within a certain tolerance of that lattice . a standard perspective to let the atomic structure generate a tiling , either by using the atoms as tile vertices or , by taking the vorono tessellation of the set of atomic locations , or by some other method . in the case of an ideal crystal , all methods yield periodic tilings with patches of tiles forming unit cells",
    ". in the case of an actual crystal , however , these tiles will be deformed within a certain tolerance and we will have an infinite number of tile shapes .",
    "infinite local complexity has long been known to arise even when there are a finite number of tile shapes .",
    "there are tilings with a finite number of tile types inside of which ` fault lines ' develop .",
    "defined formally in section [ fault.and.fractured ] , a fault line separates a tiling into half - tilings that can slide parallel to the fault line to produce new tilings from the tiling space .",
    "the presence of fault lines often result in an infinite number of local adjacencies .",
    "if we were to encode adjacency information as labels for the tiles , then we would have infinitely many labels .",
    "if a tiling of @xmath25 has only a finite number of tile shapes up to euclidean motions , it is proved in @xcite that there are only two ways ilc can appear : either along a fault line or along a fault circle .",
    "the former case requires tiles that have a straight edge somewhere , while the latter requires tiles with an edge that is a circular arc of some given radius .",
    "section [ sec : tiling.defs ] contains the details on how we conceive of tiles , tilings , tiling spaces , and the tiling metric in the presence of infinite local complexity .",
    "our definitions coincide with those for finite local complexity tilings when that condition is satisfied .",
    "section [ sec : ergodic ] addresses basic analysis of ilc tiling dynamical systems .",
    "the translation dynamical system is defined and we explain what minimality , repetitivity , and expansivity mean in this context .",
    "the notion of ` cylinder sets ' is adapted from symbolic and flc dynamics , and we show how to deal with some subtle yet important details that impact how they are used .",
    "we show how to think about translation - invariant measures and their relationship to patch frequency .",
    "finally we discuss how to generalize the notions of entropy and complexity to this situation .",
    "tilings with a hierarchical structure generated by substitution or fusion are the topic of section [ sec : hierarchical ] .",
    "the construction methods adapt pretty much directly from the flc case , except care must be taken to preserve compactness of supertile sets .",
    "transition matrices , so useful in frequency computations for flc self - similar and fusion tilings , need to be dealt with as transition maps instead .",
    "the idea of recognizability takes little work to adapt to the ilc case , but primitivity requires some care .    existing results on ilc tiling spaces are collected into section [ results.section ] .",
    "we give a ` fault lines ' a proper definition , and since they are nt topologically invariant we introduce the related idea of ` fractured ' tiling spaces .",
    "the effect of fault lines and fractures on the topological spectrum is explained before we move on to results specific to the hierarchical tilings case .",
    "the fact that primitivity continues to imply minimality is proved and conditions are given that make the converse true as well .",
    "we also explain how to think about the invariant measures for fusion systems . in the special case of fusion tilings with strictly finite supertile sets",
    "we show the similarity to flc fusion tilings .",
    "finally we tell everything that is currently known on the important question ",
    "when is an ilc tiling space homeomorphic to an flc tiling space ? \"    in section [ example.analysis ] we apply our toolbox to three different examples .",
    "a point of interest that does not appear elsewhere in the literature is how to see certain tilings ( ` direct product variations ' ) as projections of stepped , branched surfaces in higher dimensions and how that can give rise to infinite local complexity .",
    "the paper concludes with two main categories of questions about tilings with infinite local complexity .",
    "one of these has already been mentioned , the question of when an ilc tiling space is homeomorphic , or even topologically conjugate to , an flc tiling space .",
    "the other type is about how the geometric and combinatorial aspects of the tiles or tilings affect the dynamical , measure - theoretic , or topological properties of their tiling spaces .",
    "there are two main ingredients for tiles in a tiling with infinite local complexity : supports and labels .",
    "the support is the underlying set in @xmath1 and the label can be thought of as distinguishing between tiles that have congruent supports , perhaps by color or by orientation .",
    "often it is convenient to more or less ignore the labels but since they are quite handy we include them as a fundamental part of our definition .",
    "the support and label sets must work together in a precise way in order to define a coherent prototile set that can be used to construct infinite tilings via translation .",
    "let @xmath26 denote a set of subsets of @xmath1 , each of which is a topological disk containing the origin in its interior .",
    "assume @xmath26 is a compact metric space under the hausdorff metric , in which case @xmath26 can serve as a set of prototile supports .",
    "let @xmath14 be another compact metric space , to be used as the prototile label set .",
    "let @xmath27 be a continuous surjection called the _ support map _ that assigns to each label a set in @xmath1 that serves as the physical tile itself .",
    "[ prototile.def ] a _ prototile _ is a pair @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we call @xmath32 the _ support _ and @xmath33 the _ label _ of @xmath34 .",
    "a prototile set @xmath0 is the set of all prototiles associated to a given label set , support set , and support map .",
    "since the support map @xmath35 is continuous we have the property that if a sequence of labels converges in @xmath14 , their corresponding supports converge in @xmath26 .",
    "this will give us a way to talk about convergence of prototiles and compactness of the prototile set .",
    "the primary action on tiles will be by _ translation _ by @xmath36 . if @xmath37 we define the _ @xmath0-tile _ or just _ tile _ @xmath38 to be the pair @xmath39 .",
    "that is , we translate the support of @xmath34 to a different location but keep the label the same . as for prototiles , tiles have supports and labels ; the support of the above tile @xmath40 is the set @xmath41 and the label of @xmath40 is @xmath33 . given an arbitrary tile @xmath40 , we have support and label maps such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "a handy concept in tiling theory is that of the _ control point _ of a tile @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath36 , which is defined simply to be the point @xmath6 .",
    "this point represents the location in @xmath40 of the origin in @xmath34 and gives us a point of reference for each tile .",
    "a finite union of @xmath0-tiles whose supports cover a connected region and intersect only on their boundaries is called a _ patch_.    we can write @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is connected and @xmath48 is either empty or contains only boundary points whenever @xmath49 . like tiles , patches can be translated and we define @xmath50 .",
    "two patches are said to be _ equivalent _ if they are translates of one another .",
    "an infinite union of @xmath0-tiles whose supports cover the entirety of @xmath1 and whose pairwise intersections contain only boundary points is called a _ tiling _ @xmath51 .    like patches and tiles , a tiling can be translated by an element @xmath36 by translating each tile of @xmath51 by @xmath6 .",
    "this produces a new tiling we denote by @xmath52 .",
    "precisely , if @xmath53 is a tiling expressed as a union of tiles , then we write @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "this results in an exact copy of the tiling @xmath51 , except moved so that what was at the point @xmath6 is now at the origin .      in order to understand tiling spaces we need to know how to measure the distance between tiles , patches , and tilings .",
    "to simplify notation ( but not add confusion , we hope ) we will use @xmath56 to denote distance where @xmath6 and @xmath57 are tiles , patches , or tilings .",
    "each builds on the last .",
    "the distance between two tiles @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the maximum of the hausdorff distance between the supports of the tiles and the difference between the labels : @xmath60 the distance between two patches @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be computed provided the tiles are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "suppose @xmath63 is the set of all bijections @xmath64 assigning a tile from @xmath61 to a tile from @xmath62 .",
    "in this case we define @xmath65 intuitively , we take the bijection that makes the best fit between the two patches and then consider the maximum distance between tiles paired by the bijection . in the flc case patches",
    "are always matched up by a congruence , usually a translation , in which case the distance is the length of the translation vector . in the ilc case",
    "it is necessary to let the tiles move independently from one patch to the other .",
    "the metric for tilings is based on the patch metric and says that two tilings are close if they very nearly agree on a big ball around the origin . for two tilings @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "we define @xmath68 provided such an @xmath69 exists and is not greater than 1 .",
    "if there is no such @xmath69 , or if the infimum is greater than 1 , we define the distance between the tilings to be 1 .      rather than trying to study an individual tiling it often makes sense to study all tilings that have certain properties in common .",
    "the standard way to do this , motivated by physical applications , is to construct a topological space of tilings .    a _ tiling space _",
    "@xmath70 is a set of tilings of @xmath1 that is invariant under the action of translation and closed under the topology given by the tiling metric @xmath71 .",
    "one common way to make a tiling space is by taking the closure of the translational orbit of some fixed tiling @xmath51 , in which case we write @xmath72 .",
    "this tiling space is called the _ hull _ of @xmath51 .",
    "tiling spaces are compact in the metric topology .",
    "we establish sequential compactness for patch sets and then extend to tilings .",
    "the key to seeing this is to show that the set of all patches contained in a bounded region and having a fixed number @xmath73 of tiles is compact for every @xmath73 .",
    "such a set of patches is parameterized by a bounded subset of @xmath74 , where the elements of @xmath75 are the locations of the control points and thus lie in a bounded region .",
    "the individual tiles in any sequence of patches will have convergent subsequences since @xmath0 is compact and the tiles lie in a bounded region .",
    "we can diagonalize to get a sequence of patches for which all of the individual tiles converge ; since each patch in the sequence is connected and the tiles have nonoverlapping boundaries , the limit will have this property as well .",
    "thus every sequence of @xmath73-tile patches in a bounded region has a convergent subsequence .",
    "sequential compactness for @xmath70 now follows by finding subsequences of tilings that have convergent sequences of patches covering larger and larger regions around the origin .",
    "in definition [ prototile.def ] we defined the prototile set as being a representative set of tiles located so that the origin lies in their support at a control point .",
    "the _ transversal _ @xmath76 of a tiling space @xmath70 is the set of all tilings in @xmath70 with a control point at the origin .",
    "put another way , @xmath76 is the set of all tilings in @xmath70 containing a prototile .",
    "every tiling in @xmath70 is the translation of lots of tilings from the transversal.moreover , every point in the tiling space has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open set in @xmath1 crossed with an open subset of the transversal .",
    "much of the work done on flc tiling spaces uses the transversal in an essential way .",
    "for instance , the @xmath77-algebra of a tiling space is strongly morita equivalent to the @xmath77-algebra of its transversal .",
    "this means the @xmath78-theory of the tiling space can be computed from the transversal . by the gap - labelling theorem , we then understand the possible energy levels that the tiling space can support when considered as an atomic model .",
    "the transversal also makes possible the definition of a laplace - beltrami operator that holds information on key mechanical properties of solids .",
    "this has been studied in the flc case in , for example , @xcite ; there is hope that this analysis can be extended to at least some tilings with infinite local complexity .",
    "thus it is important to understand the structure of the transversal .",
    "when a tiling space has finite local complexity , the transversal is always totally disconnected and , under the condition of repetitivity , is a cantor set .",
    "tilings with infinite local complexity can also have transversals that are cantor sets , but they can also have more complicated transversals .",
    "lemma 3.2 of @xcite states that having a totally disconnected transversal is a topological invariant of tiling spaces .",
    "@xcite if two tiling spaces are homeomorphic and one has a totally disconnected transversal , then so does the other .",
    "the transversal of the pinwheel tiling looks like two cantor sets , each crossed with a circle .",
    "the way to see this is to first imagine a pinwheel tile with the control point at the origin .",
    "the set of all tilings that contain this tile will be a cantor set since distinct tilings are always separated by some amount determined by the closest place on which they differ , yet each tiling is the limit of a sequence of other tilings .",
    "now this cantor set must be rotated in all amounts to get half the tiling space .",
    "the other half of the space is obtained by doing the same thing with the flip of the pinwheel tile we started with .",
    "we describe the nature of the transversal for several examples in section [ example.analysis ] .",
    "since tilings can be used to model the atomic structure of quasicrystals , the statistical , large - scale approach of ergodic theory makes sense : anything happening on a set of measure zero is nt physically observable and so can be ignored .",
    "_ miles of tiles_@xcite is an exposition of the method that explains the physical motivation for non - physicists .",
    "we begin by interpreting fundamental dynamics concepts to our situation .",
    "translation provides a natural action of @xmath1 on @xmath70 that is continuous in the tiling metric and allows us to take a dynamical approach .",
    "a _ tiling dynamical system _",
    "@xmath79 is a tiling space @xmath70 along with the action of @xmath1 by translation .",
    "a dynamical system is said to be _ minimal _ if the orbit of every tiling under translation is dense .",
    "a minimal flc tiling system has the property that all possible patches of any size can be found in any given tiling @xmath51 .",
    "since there are many more patches in an ilc system , minimality guarantees that every patch found in any tiling can be arbitrarily well approximated by one from any given tiling @xmath51 .",
    "it is fairly easy to construct a minimal ilc tiling space by using traditional techniques , for instance with substitution as in section [ sec : hierarchical ] .",
    "a tiling @xmath51 is said to be _ repetitive _ if for every patch @xmath80 that appears in @xmath51 and every @xmath81 , there is an @xmath82 for which every ball of radius @xmath82 in @xmath51 contains a patch that is within @xmath69 of @xmath80 .",
    "the orbit closure of @xmath51 is a minimal tiling system if @xmath51 is repetitive .",
    "a tiling dynamical system is said to be _ expansive _ if there is a @xmath83 such that whenever @xmath84 for all @xmath36 , it means that @xmath85 for some @xmath86 with @xmath87 . in an expansive system , then , the only way for the entire orbits of two tilings to be close is if they were small translates of one another to begin with .",
    "flc tiling spaces , like their cousins the shift spaces , always have expansive dynamical systems .",
    "however , infinite local complexity brings us examples of tiling systems that do not have expansive dynamics .",
    "such an example appears as our example [ solenoid.extensions ] .      in classical symbolic dynamics",
    "it is commonplace to consider the set of all sequences that have a specific symbol or word in a given location , and this set is called a cylinder set .",
    "this notion generalizes nicely to the flc tiling situation , where we need to specify both a patch @xmath80 and an open set @xmath88 , such that the cylinder set @xmath89 is the set of all tilings that contain the patch @xmath80 in a location designated by @xmath88 .",
    "two properties of cylinder sets are essential to bring into the ilc situation .",
    "first , they generate the metric topology .",
    "second , they can be used to compute the frequency with which the patch @xmath80 appears throughout the tiling space .    when we have infinitely many different two - tile patches , the cylinder sets based on single patches do not generate the topology .",
    "moreover , it is possible that every individual patch has frequency 0 .",
    "this means we need to make cylinder sets based on _ sets _ of patches , for instance , the set of all patches that are within @xmath69 of some particular patch . to measure frequency accurately",
    "we need to define sets of patches that do nt contain any ` repeats ' up to translation :    a set of patches @xmath90 is said to be _ trim _ if , for some fixed open set @xmath91 and every @xmath92 , there is at most one patch @xmath93 and point @xmath94 for which @xmath95 .",
    "thus a trim set does not contain patches that are arbitrarily small translates of one another , or patches that sit in arbitrarily small translates of other patches .",
    "let @xmath91 and let @xmath90 be a set of patches .",
    "the _ cylinder set _ @xmath96 is the set of all tilings in @xmath70 for which there is some patch @xmath93 and point @xmath94 for which @xmath97 .    if @xmath90 is a trim set with a small enough @xmath88 , we know that a tiling can only be in the cylinder set via one specific patch @xmath80 and point @xmath6 .",
    "if we let @xmath98 be the indicator function for this set , then @xmath99 as @xmath6 ranges through some subset of @xmath1 will count the number of times a patch from @xmath90 appears in @xmath51 in that subset , without overcounting .",
    "cylinder sets given by trim sets generate the metric topology on @xmath70 .",
    "we establish that every ball of radius @xmath69 around a tiling @xmath51 can be obtained as a cylinder set .",
    "take the smallest patch in @xmath51 that contains @xmath100 and call it @xmath80 , and denote by @xmath6 the control point of a tile in @xmath80 containing the origin .",
    "the set of all patches that are within @xmath69 of @xmath80 can be partitioned into a trim set of translation classes",
    "@xmath90 : take all patches @xmath101 that have a control point at @xmath6 and for which @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 is a cylinder set that equals the ball of radius @xmath69 around @xmath51 .",
    "we begin this discussion by reviewing how translation - invariant borel probability measures can be used to compute frequencies in the flc case . given some finite patch @xmath80 ,",
    "if @xmath88 is a sufficiently small open set and @xmath104 is an invariant measure we can define the frequency of @xmath80 to be @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath104 is ergodic then by the ergodic theorem for @xmath104-a.e @xmath51 we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the indicator function for @xmath89 .",
    "the integral represents the number of times we see a copy of @xmath80 in the ball of radius @xmath82 around the origin in @xmath51 , so averaging this by the size of the ball gives us the frequency of @xmath80 .    in the ilc case ,",
    "when @xmath104 is a translation - invariant measure and @xmath90 is a trim set we still see that @xmath108 is a multiple of @xmath109 for all sufficiently small sets @xmath88 .",
    "thus we can define the frequency of @xmath90 to be @xmath110 as before . and as before we are justified in the use of the word  frequency \" by the ergodic theorem .",
    "if @xmath90 is a trim @xmath69-ball around some patch @xmath80 , then @xmath111 is the percent of time we see patches that look almost exactly like @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath112 be the set of all connected @xmath73-tile patches that have a control point at the origin and are translates of patches that appear in @xmath70 .",
    "the metric on patches gives us a measurable structure on @xmath112 , and since every subset of @xmath112 is trim , @xmath113 forms a measure on @xmath112 .",
    "if we want , we can consider @xmath114 , which is not itself a trim set .",
    "however , since any subset of a trim set is trim , we can consider @xmath113 to be a measure on ( the set of measurable subsets of ) any trim subset of @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath104 is a probability measure , then the frequency measure on @xmath112 is _ volume - normalized _ , meaning that @xmath116 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath117 and @xmath70 can be arbitrarily finely approximated by cylinder sets of the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 for some representative set of @xmath73-supertiles .",
    "we develop a notion of complexity based on the standard form in symbolic dynamics , but taking ideas from topological pressure theory and the topological entropy of flows .",
    "the complexity function distinguishes the sort of infinite local complexity represented by the solenoid ( example [ solenoid.extensions ] ) from that of , say , tilings which have a higher topological dimension than their ambient dimension ( example [ dpvexample ] , for instance ) .",
    "there are three interrelated ways to define the complexity function , all of which yield slightly different actual numbers but have the same asymptotics and are based on the idea that complexity should count the number of patches of size @xmath121 one might see in @xmath70 . to that end",

    "it is convenient to work with fusion rules for which all of the supertiles grow in area in a reasonable way , for instance without becoming arbitrarily long and skinny .",
    "one way to avoid this is to require that the boundaries of supertiles are small relative to their interiors . to this end , for @xmath267 and any set @xmath268 we define @xmath269 to be the set of all points in @xmath1 that are within @xmath270 of the boundary of @xmath88 .",

    "let the standard basis vectors in @xmath419 correspond to the letters in @xmath149 and let the standard basis vectors of @xmath420 correspond to those in @xmath413 , so that the tile @xmath415 is represented by the corresponding facet that contains the origin , one standard direction in @xmath419 , and one in @xmath420 .",
    "the remaining hypercube faces that contain the origin are those that take both other vectors in either @xmath419 or @xmath420 .",
    "these do nt correspond to tiles in the dpv and so do not appear in the facet substitution ( or rather , they appear as holes ) . to give the tiling parameters",
    "@xmath421 we simply project it to the plane via the matrix @xmath422    it is easy to construct dpvs that have fractures in both the horizontal and vertical directions by varying the direct product of two substitutions that have non - pisot length expansions .",
    "( the primary example in @xcite is of this form . ) by choosing irrationally related side lengths and irrationally related height lengths we obtain a topologically weakly mixing system .",
    "here we consider the tiling space @xmath423 obtained by the compact label set @xmath214 .",
    "for convenience of notation we will make a partial order on the label set : @xmath424 whenever that is true for @xmath233 and @xmath250 as integers , and also if @xmath233 is an integer and @xmath425 .",
    "every integer label is ` less than ' every compactification label .",
    "we will see that on the measurable level the @xmath423s are all the same , but on the topological level they are quite different .      by looking at @xmath426 for some",
    "@xmath427 we can think about the transition map @xmath428 .",
    "@xmath429 we have one 3 and one @xmath233 ; a pair of @xmath161s , four ones , and eight zeroes .",
    "if instead we break it into 1-supertiles , we have four of type 1 , two of type 2 , and one each of types @xmath331 and @xmath233 .",
    "we begin to suspect that the number of @xmath73-supertiles of type @xmath250 , for @xmath430 , in an @xmath135-supertile is equal to the number of tiles of type @xmath250 and has nothing to do with @xmath135 as long as @xmath135 is larger than @xmath250 . if @xmath250 is larger than @xmath135 , then it is @xmath136 unless we are in an @xmath135-supertile that is also of type @xmath250 . in the former case",
    "we see that the number of @xmath73-supertiles of type @xmath250 in @xmath431 is @xmath432 and we have    @xmath433    for a fixed @xmath73 and @xmath126 , we can always choose an @xmath135 such that every @xmath135-supertile contains a tile arbitrarily close to @xmath434 for any @xmath430 .",
    "the details of this will depend on the topology of @xmath14 , in particular on the speed with which sequences converge to elements of @xmath241 .",
    "this proves primitivity and hence minimality .",
    "every solenoid extension is measurably conjugate to the dyadic solenoid , defined as the inverse limit @xmath435 .",
    "elements of @xmath436 take the form @xmath437 such that for each @xmath73 , @xmath438 .",
    "we define @xmath439 as follows .",
    "the position of the origin in the tile containing it determines @xmath440 , choosing @xmath441 if the origin is on the boundary between two tiles .",
    "the origin is either in the left or right half of the 1-supertile that contains it .",
    "if it is in the left half we let @xmath442 and if it is in the right half or exactly in the middle we let @xmath443 .",
    "once this is determined we look at whether the origin is in the left half of the 2-supertile containing it or if it is in the right ( or exactly in the middle ) . in the former case",
    "we let @xmath444 and in the latter we let @xmath445 . since the origin lies somewhere in an @xmath73-supertile for every @xmath446 we can inductively define @xmath64 for all of @xmath423 .",
    "every tiling @xmath447 that does nt contain any element of @xmath241 is sent to a unique point in @xmath436 . since such tilings form a set of full measure we have measurable conjugacy .",
    "the rest of the tilings in @xmath423 do not map in a one - to - one fashion since a tiling that is made of two infinite - order supertiles maps to an element of the solenoid that knows the position of the origin in its supertile but not what element of @xmath241 the tiling contains .",
    "this also explains why the one - point compactification is topologically conjugate to the solenoid .",
    "since @xmath423 is measurably conjugate to the dyadic solenoid it must be uniquely ergodic and share its purely discrete measurable spectrum @xmath448 $ ] . the frequency measures are supported on the subset of the transversal on which @xmath64 is one - to - one , i.e. no infinite - order supertiles .",
    "however , the nature of the limits does affect the nature of the measurable isomorphism . a ball of radius @xmath69 around a tiling with a given element of @xmath241 at the origin maps onto a set of equal measure in the solenoid , but this set will vary as the elements of @xmath241 do , or when the sequences that converge to them do .      to begin we consider the one - point compactification that has elements of @xmath213 converging monotonically to a single limit point @xmath278 . in this case",
    "we can see that @xmath423 is topologically conjugate to the dyadic solenoid using the argument from the previous section on measurable conjugacy . in that argument",
    "the map is one - to - one for each tiling in @xmath423 that does not contain an element of @xmath241 but multiple - to - one on those that do .",
    "however , the multiple copies are in correspondence to the number of elements of @xmath241 .",
    "since in this case there is only one element of @xmath241 the map continues to be one - to - one on the exceptional tilings , so it is one - to - one everywhere and thus provides a topological conjugacy to the dyadic solenoid .",
    "this gives us the unusual situation where the tiling dynamical system is not expansive . to see this , choose any @xmath449 and find an @xmath135 such that if @xmath450 , then the distance between prototiles labelled @xmath451 and @xmath452 is less than @xmath453 .",
    "any two tilings @xmath454 and @xmath455 for which the origin sits in the same location in its @xmath135-supertile will then satisfy the property that @xmath456 for all @xmath18 regardless of the type of the @xmath135-supertile .",
    "the way to think about this is that each @xmath135-supertile differs from any other only on the first tile , and those first tiles are labelled greater than @xmath135 and thus differ by less than @xmath453 .    the situation for two - point compactifications becomes more subtle .",
    "the version for which all even numbers converge monotonically to @xmath278 and all odd numbers converge monotonically to @xmath457 is shown to be topologically conjugate to the flc tiling space generated by the ` period - doubling ' substitution @xmath458 , where @xmath459 and @xmath460 are unit length tiles .",
    "if instead @xmath213 is partitioned into two sets @xmath32 and @xmath461 , one converging to @xmath278 and the other to @xmath457 , the measures of clopen subsets of the transversal are determined by @xmath462 , and thus so is the gap - labelling group .",
    "two tiling spaces , one with @xmath19 and the other with @xmath463 can be compared , and whether or not they are topologically conjugate or even homeomorphic depends on how these constants are related .",
    "see @xcite for details .    by compactifying with limit sets that have an interesting topology",
    ", we can obtain tiling spaces with nontrivial cohomologies in @xmath464 .",
    "these examples can be distinguished by their cohomology .",
    "the topology of the transversal depends on the topology of @xmath241 .",
    "suppose that @xmath465 are two tilings that have an element of @xmath241 at the origin .",
    "note that @xmath51 and @xmath260 are made of two infinite - order supertiles and thus can only differ at the origin .",
    "so if it were possible to make two open sets in @xmath76 that disconnected the transversal and contain one each of @xmath51 and @xmath260 , those sets would correspond to two open sets in @xmath241 that disconnected @xmath241 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath241 can be separated by two open sets , then if @xmath51 and @xmath260 contain an element of these sets at the origin , we can partition the rest of the elements of @xmath14 so that they are close to one or the other of the subsets of @xmath241 to create a pair of open sets that disconnect @xmath76 and contain @xmath51 and @xmath260 respectively .",
    "thus @xmath76 is disconnected if and only if @xmath241 is .    in particular ,",
    "the one- and two - point compactifications of the solenoid have totally disconnected transversals .",
    "the one - point compactification is not strongly expansive because it is not expansive . to see this ,",
    "consider a fixed @xmath449 and let @xmath466 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 have an @xmath135-supertile beginning at the origin , where @xmath135 is sufficiently large that any two elements of @xmath241 that are greater than @xmath135 are within @xmath453 in the tile metric .",
    "then @xmath51 and @xmath260 differ at most on the beginning of each @xmath135-supertile , but these are all within @xmath453 of one another in the patch metric .",
    "thus @xmath467 for all @xmath468 and the dynamics on the transversal are not expansive ( and indeed the overall dynamical system is not expansive ) .",
    "thus theorem [ one - d - flcresult ] confirms that the one - point compactification is not homeomorphic to any flc tiling system .    by a similar argument",
    "we can show that the two - point compactification is homeomorphic to a flc tiling space by theorem [ one - d - flcresult ] .",
    "this is because even if two tilings very nearly agree on the central @xmath135-supertile , each of them are bound to have @xmath135-supertiles whose first tiles are close to distinct elements of @xmath241 and thus not to each other .    if @xmath241 is not totally disconnected , then its solenoid extension is not homeomorphic to a one - dimensional tiling space with finite local complexity .",
    "this is the topological invariant that lets us see that the one - point compactification , while failing to have finite local complexity , does so in a way that is much less complex than a non - periodic flc tiling space . in order to be specific about complexity",
    "let us use @xmath127 , the minimum number of @xmath122- balls of radius @xmath69 balls it takes to cover @xmath70 .",
    "take @xmath469 such that any element @xmath470 is within @xmath69 of the limit point @xmath471 in @xmath14 .",
    "every @xmath73-supertile with @xmath470 is within @xmath472 of any other in the patch metric .",
    "this means that that the system is basically periodic with period @xmath473 , up to @xmath69 , and @xmath474 is bounded multiple of @xmath473 once @xmath121 is sufficiently large relative to @xmath69 .",
    "this means that the system has bounded complexity in the sense of section [ entropy.complexity ] .",
    "no matter how complicated @xmath241 is , the complexity can not become too high and there will always be zero entropy .",
    "this is because , for any @xmath126 , an @xmath475cover of @xmath14 into @xmath135 elements effectively reduces @xmath423 to a solenoid extension on @xmath135 elements .",
    "there are two main types of questions that seem to be important in the study of tiling spaces with infinite local complexity .",
    "one is to ask , what properties of these spaces are invariant under homeomorphism or some other type of conjugacy ? another is to ask , how do combinatorial and geometric factors influence the dynamical , measure - theoretic , topological , or complexity properties ?",
    "it was already known from @xcite that infinite local complexity is not a topological invariant .",
    "the solenoid extensions considered here show that infinite local complexity is not preserved by measurable or topological conjugacy either .",
    "so what are the important classes of infinite local complexity ?",
    "even though flc is nt an invariant property , there should be some properties that guarantee that a tiling space is topologically conjugate , or measurably conjugate , or just homeomorphic to one that is flc . in one dimension , theorem [ one - d - flcresult ] gives a topologically - invariant characterization of this class . in higher dimensions geometry",
    "becomes an obstacle and a direct generalization is unlikely to be sufficient : the methods used in the one - dimensional proof do nt produce valid tilings in higher dimensions .",
    "so the topological classification of flc in 2 or higher dimensions remains unresolved , along with the dynamical classification in any dimension .",
    "the property of being constructed from a finite set of prototiles is also not invariant .",
    "a simple example is the tiling space made out of unit square tiles that lie in rows that are offset by random amounts .",
    "we can introduce an infinite number of tile types symbolically , by constructing an infinite label set given by all the possible coronas , which produces a topologically conjugate tiling space .",
    "alternatively , we can introduce an infinite number of tile types geometrically by taking the space of dual tilings .",
    "if we use the centers of the tiles as the vertices of the dual prototiles , the dual prototile set consists of one square and infinitely many triangles of equal areas but different angles , and is not even compact . since many important tiling models assume a finite prototile set , knowing properties that guarantee that a space is equivalent to one with this property seems essential .",
    "the combinatorics in the tilings in the last paragraph are all basically the same and depend only on whether an offset between rows is zero or not .",
    "thus the combinatorics of that particular tiling space do not reveal information about local complexity . by way of contrast",
    ", the combinatorics of the dpv of example [ dpvexample ] will determine whether the tiling space has finite or infinite local complexity .",
    "the interplay between combinatorics and complexity is especially evident in the dpv case .",
    "if one does not vary the direct product substitutions , no geometric factors can influence the local complexity of the tiling space : it is guaranteed to have flc .",
    "but if one does vary the direct product to produce a dpv , then the local complexity depends on several factors : the inflation constant , the specific combinatorics of the substitution , and the sizes of the tiles .",
    "more generally , in the category of primitive fusion or substitution tilings the interplay between combinatorics , geometry , number theory , topology , and dynamics is an important area of investigation .",
    "it is known that some form of pisot condition on the expansion factor has a profound effect on dynamics and complexity ( cf .",
    "such pisot conditions enforce a rigidity on the tiling space ; the dynamics and complexity are severely restricted . in the absence of a pisot condition , combinatorics and geometry can influence the tiling space in numerous ways . in order to understand certain tiling models",
    "it is important that we understand the nature of this influence .",
