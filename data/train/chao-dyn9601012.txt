    "turbulent flows subjected to differential rotation develop spectral anisotropy .",
    "understanding and modeling such flows present a major theoretical and experimental challenge , mainly due to their geophysical , astrophysical and plasma physics importance .",
    "the simplest two - dimensional system of this kind describes the flow of a thin layer of homogeneous fluid on the surface of a rotating sphere .",
    "such flows are governed by the barotropic vorticity equation in the @xmath0-plane approximation in which the fluid moves in tangential planes @xcite , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the fluid vorticity , @xmath10 is the molecular viscosity , and @xmath11 is the forcing ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are directed eastward and northward , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath0 is the background vorticity gradient describing the latitudinal variation of the normal component of the coriolis parameter , @xmath14 .",
    "considering the energy transfer subrange typical of classical isotropic two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , we assume that the forcing @xmath11 is concentrated around some high wave number @xmath15 and is random , zero - mean , gaussian and white noise in time with the correlation function    @xmath16    where @xmath17 denotes ensemble average .",
    "thus defined , the forcing @xmath11 supplies the system ( 1 ) with energy and enstrophy at rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in the inviscid limit ,",
    "the corresponding total energy and enstrophy vary in time as in the isotropic case , according to @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; the @xmath0-term does not enter these evolution laws explicitly .",
    "in the linear limit with no forcing , eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes propagation of planetary , or rossby waves with the dispersion relation @xmath22 while in the nonlinear limit without the @xmath0-term , this equation represents classical isotropic 2d turbulence .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ one ] ) describes the interaction of 2d turbulence and rossby waves and is important for understanding of planetary scale geophysical processes .    the relative simplicity of eq . ( [ one ] )",
    "has placed it at the focal point of theoretical geophysical fluid dynamics , and much has been learned from this model .",
    "however , the large scale behavior of its solutions still remains controversial ; their spectral evolution laws have not been well established , while the spectral anisotropy and the importance of nonlinearity have received insufficient attention in the existing literature . here ,",
    "using dns , we address the problems of scaling laws and spectral anisotropy of @xmath0-plane turbulence governed by ( 1 ) and forced at small scales . in the next section , evolution and scaling laws of @xmath0-plane turbulence will be discussed .",
    "on relatively small scales the @xmath0-effect is small and the flow is nearly isotropic . on larger scales , the effect of",
    "the @xmath6-term becomes progressively stronger , and spectral anisotropy develops .",
    "along with that , spectral evolution slows down considerably , compared to the isotropic case . as a result",
    ", prohibitively long integration time is required for low wavenumber modes to become excited even for relatively moderate resolution . to address this problem ,",
    "les of @xmath0-plane turbulence can be sought . in section 3 , an eddy viscosity for such les",
    "is calculated .",
    "this sgs representation includes negative laplacian term that accounts for the unresolved small scale forcing and inverse cascade .",
    "thus , this sgs representation gives rise to a stabilized negative viscosity ( snv ) sgs parameterization @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "some results of the application of this snv representation to isotropic 2d flows are presented . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "preliminary asymptotic analysis of eq . ( 1 ) reveals that as @xmath23 , the amplitude of the @xmath0-term decays as @xmath24 , so that for large @xmath25 , the @xmath0-effect is expected to be small and the system should behave mostly as isotropic 2d turbulence in the energy transfer subrange @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum defined as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the total energy , is nearly isotropic , @xmath28 , and kolmo - gorov - like , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the kolmogorov constant . on the other hand ,",
    "rossby waves dominate as @xmath31 . assuming that the energy spectrum in this limit is determined by @xmath0 and @xmath25 only , one finds , using dimensional considerations @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , by analogy to the kolmogorov constant , can be referred to as the rhines constant . for isotropic",
    "2d turbulence , the estimate of the kolmogorov constant @xmath30 from dns and analytical theories of turbulence is about 6 . on the other hand , the rhines spectrum ( 5 ) has not been observed in dns so far so that not only no estimate of @xmath33 is available , but even the very existence of the spectrum ( 5 ) has been in doubt .",
    "turbulence and waves have comparable effects when the eddy turnover time of isotropic 2d turbulence approaches the rossby wave period , which occurs at a transitional wave number , @xmath34 , @xmath35 the contour ( [ five ] ) in wavevector space has been termed `` the dumb - bell shape '' by vallis and maltrud @xcite ; earlier , a similar contour was called `` lazy 8 '' by holloway @xcite in the context of @xmath0-plane flow predictability studies . according to @xcite , as @xmath36 , the inverse energy cascade slows down , and increasing spectral anisotropy facilitates preferential energy transfer into large scale structures with @xmath37 , or zonal jets .",
    "this conceptual picture was further developed in later publications .",
    "in particular , vallis and maltrud @xcite found that as @xmath36 , the dumb - bell shape becomes a barrier for turbulence energy .",
    "however , since the dumb - bell shape excludes the axis @xmath4 , the inverse cascade can continue in the vicinity of @xmath4 facilitating the funneling of the energy into coherent structures corresponding to zonal flows .",
    "rhines @xcite , vallis and maltrud @xcite , and holloway @xcite note that the spectral anisotropy induced by the @xmath0-term can be associated with the mechanism of generation and maintenance of zonal flows .",
    "zonal structures are robust features of the simulations by rhines @xcite , vallis and maltrud @xcite and panetta @xcite , as well as of the large scale earth and planetary circulations . on the other hand , for @xmath38 one would expect that nonlinear transfer becomes relatively ineffective , and the flow regimes inside the dumb - bell shape are more prone to linear dynamics @xcite .",
    "although this assumption underlines some theories , it has not been thoroughly tested in dns so far .",
    "generally , processes at @xmath39 were avoided in the previous dns of @xmath6-plane turbulence .",
    "thus , not only could these processes not be properly resolved ( @xmath40 usually did not exceed 20 or so ) , but the whole region @xmath41 was treated rather as an area of large scale energy dissipation due to linear ( ekman ) drag or other factors .    in the present dns , the processes at scales of the order of @xmath42 and larger are of primary interest .",
    "these dns employ a fully - dealiased pseudospectral fourier method to solve eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) in a box @xmath43 \\times[0,2\\pi]$ ] with doubly periodic boundary conditions and zero initial data .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath44 and the 2/3 dealiasing rule is used .",
    "the time discretization is the same as in @xcite .",
    "a hyperviscous term of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is introduced in ( [ one ] ) to ensure sharp energy removal from both small and large wave number modes .",
    "the forcing @xmath11 is represented by @xmath48 for @xmath49 $ ] and is zero otherwise ; here , @xmath50 is the time step , and @xmath51 is a discrete and uncorrelated in time , gaussian , random number with unit variance .",
    "parameter setting for dns reported here is : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 which results in an energy injection rate of @xmath56 .",
    "results of three dns , with @xmath0 = 0 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , corresponding to @xmath40 = @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively , are reported here and shown in figs .",
    "these cases will be referred to as case 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "all simulations were terminated when the energy reached the largest scales available in the computational box and condensation started affecting flow behavior at smaller scales @xcite .    in figure 1 , we plot the evolution of total energy and enstrophy normalized by the corresponding values , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , of the steady state , isotropic ( @xmath0 = 0 ) case .",
    "a striking feature is that increasing in @xmath0 causes increasing in computational time necessary for the effects of condensation to appear .",
    "for example , for @xmath0=0.3 , the effect of large scale energy saturation becomes significant at about @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the large scale eddy turnover time of the steady state in the isotropic case . for comparison , in the corresponding isotropic dns , the large scale energy condensate forms after only about @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the dramatic increase in computational time necessary for the energy to reach the lowest active modes in the system is the major factor hampering dns of @xmath0-plane turbulence ; the problem is exacerbated with increasing resolution .",
    "the reason why such a long integration time is required will be explained later .",
    "the results plotted in figure 1 show that in agreement with the conservation law , @xmath67 exhibits linear in time growth .",
    "the analysis of mode - wise energy distribution ( not shown here ) indicates that increasingly longer time is required for saturation of the lower modes .    in figures",
    "24 we plot @xmath68-dependent energy spectra averaged over small sectors @xmath69 around @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for case 1 , as expected , the spectrum is isotropic and kolmogorov - like . when @xmath72 , spectral anisotropy develops .",
    "3 and 4 indicate , this anisotropy becomes more and more pronounced with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "although , as mentioned earlier , spectral evolution slows down with @xmath73 , spectral anisotropy develops relatively fast . in figure 3",
    "we show that for case 2 with @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath75 , anisotropization begins at @xmath76 , while for case 3 with @xmath77 , anisotropization starts immediately .",
    "long term integration indicates that in the direction @xmath70 , or @xmath78 , the kolmogorov scaling ( 4 ) develops , while for the directions @xmath79 , a scaling similar to that of rhines ( 5 ) , @xmath80 , prevails .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "3 , fig . 4",
    "presents results of dns with larger @xmath0 , or larger @xmath40 , leading to better resolution of the region @xmath81 and a more pronounced @xmath80 spectrum . in figure 5",
    ", we compare the compensated spectrum @xmath82 along @xmath83 at the end of integration for cases 2 and 3 , i.e. , for @xmath84 and 30.12 , respectively . an important conclusion that can be drawn from this comparison",
    "is that along @xmath79 , the energy spectrum scales with @xmath85 . combined with dimensional considerations ,",
    "this result reaffirms the validity of the scaling ( 5 ) along @xmath79 .",
    "more detailed analysis of the anisotropic spectra reveals that the kolmogorov @xmath1 scaling holds for almost all directions @xmath2 except for the small vicinity of @xmath86 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the inverse energy transfer does not cease for any direction and any @xmath87 and eventually extends to the largest scales available in the system . rather than being a barrier , or even a soft barrier for the inverse energy cascade",
    ", @xmath88 only appears to be a threshold of spectral anisotropy .",
    "after the energy front reaches @xmath88 , some readjustment of @xmath30 is observed ; its value decreases from 6 to about 3 .",
    "this points to the active energy exchange between the kolmogorov and rhines scaling regions facilitated by nonlinear interactions and to intensification of the rhines s flow regime at the expense of its kolmogorov counterpart .",
    "generally , since the @xmath80 spectrum is much steeper than the @xmath1 spectrum , most of energy resides in sectors closely adjacent to @xmath79 , so that the angular - averaged energy spectrum also obeys rhines s @xmath5 scaling ( 5 ) . therefore",
    ", the present dns confirms rhines s arguments in @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is the first time that the @xmath5 spectrum is observed in dns .",
    "our results also show why meaningful dns of @xmath0-plane turbulence requires much longer integration times than the corresponding isotropic dns .",
    "indeed , from the total energy evolution law for both isotropic and @xmath6-plane turbulence , @xmath89 , one estimates that the time required for the energy front to reach wave number @xmath25 is @xmath90 .",
    "for the same @xmath91 , the ratio of these characteristic time scales , @xmath92 , for rhines and kolmogorov spectra can be estimated from ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) by angular averaging and integrating corresponding energy spectra between @xmath93 and @xmath25 giving @xmath94 . for cases 2 and 3 and @xmath95 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath92 is of the order of 80 and 2500 , respectively .    here , further discussion of the physical meaning of @xmath40 given by ( 6 ) would be relevant .",
    "other definitions of @xmath40 have been used in the literature interchangingly with ( 6 ) ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "one of those definitions is due to rhines @xcite , @xmath96 , and another one is due to holloway and hendershott @xcite , @xmath97 . here",
    ", @xmath98 is a characteristic velocity which can be identified with the square root of the total energy of the system , while @xmath9 is a characteristic vorticity that can be identified with the square root of the total enstrophy of the system . for the @xmath5 spectrum",
    ", it can be shown that , within numerical coefficients , both rhines s and holloway and hendershott s definitions provide @xmath99 , where @xmath25 is the smallest wavenumber attained by the energy front .",
    "furthermore , taking into account the evolution law of @xmath0-plane turbulence , one can show that thus defined @xmath40 is time dependent , @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , definitions ( 6 ) and those suggested by rhines @xcite and holloway and hendershott @xcite characterize different processes in @xmath0-plane turbulence .",
    "while the former provides the stationary threshold separating the regions of nearly isotropic and strongly anisotropic , rossby wave dominated turbulence , the latter pertain to the largest scales available in the system at any given time .    to better understand the anisotropy of the energy ( or enstrophy ) spectrum of @xmath6-plane turbulence ,",
    "let us consider the enstrophy transfer function @xmath101 derived from the enstrophy equation @xmath102 \\om(\\k , t ) = \\hh_\\om ( \\k , t).\\ ] ] here , @xmath103 is vorticity correlation function , and @xmath101 is given by @xmath104    let us introduce a cutoff wavenumber @xmath105 separating explicit @xmath106 and implicit , or sgs @xmath107 modes and consider enstrophy exchange between all implicit modes and a given explicit mode @xmath68 in the limit @xmath108 .",
    "following @xcite , this exchange is denoted by @xmath109 and is obtained from ( 8) by extending integration only over all such triangles @xmath110 that @xmath111 and/or @xmath112 are greater than @xmath105 .    in figure 6 , we plot the anisotropic energy transfer @xmath113 derived from the corresponding enstrophy transfer @xmath109 for case 3 with @xmath114 .",
    "obviously , @xmath115 describes energy transfer from all sgs modes with @xmath116 to an explicit mode with the wavenumber @xmath117 , @xmath118 . as in @xcite , this energy transfer function",
    "was calculated here directly from dns results .",
    "consistently with the isotropic case @xcite , @xmath113 develops a cusp at @xmath119 . as @xmath31 , strong anisotropy prevails , and most of the energy is funneled into the sectors adjacent to @xmath79 . on the one hand ,",
    "the modes with small @xmath120 carry most of the energy ; on the other , they allow for weak @xmath12-dependency of the flow field , thus maintaining nontrivial nonlinearity which in turn sustains anisotropic transfer . thus , the modes with small @xmath120 correspond to nearly one - dimensional , zonal structures , or jets .",
    "such structures are clearly seen in an instantaneous snapshot of the vorticity field in physical space at @xmath121 for case 3 as plotted in fig . 7",
    "; these jets have also been a robust feature of earlier simulations @xcite .",
    "the observation that can be made based upon the present dns is that the number of jets is very close to the minimal excited wavenumber in the energy spectrum ; there is no obvious linkage between the number of jets and @xmath40 .",
    "the zonally - averaged velocity component @xmath122 is plotted in fig . 8 for case 3 . initially , the jets were nearly symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath123 .",
    "by @xmath124 , the zonal jets develop strong asymmetry ; as also observed in @xcite , eastward jets are sharp and narrow while westward jets are smooth and wide .",
    "it is important to know whether or not these jets are stable with respect to perturbations with nonzero @xmath120 . although the velocity field is time - dependent , the meridional motions are rather slow compared to zonal flows . in this case , the rayleigh ",
    "kuo inviscid stability criterion generalized for @xmath125 requires that the profile @xmath126 has no inflection points for the flow to be linearly stable .",
    "examination of the second derivative @xmath127 shown in fig .",
    "8 demonstrates that the rayleigh ",
    "kuo criterion @xmath128 does hold , which also agrees with the results in @xcite . furthermore",
    ", as time advances , the profile of @xmath127 develops large negative peaks thus ensuring linear stability at later times .",
    "as long as the effect of the large scale drag remains small , excitation of progressively smaller wavenumber modes leads to a diminishing number of jets , in agreement with other simulations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in models of barotropic flows on a @xmath6-plane with externally imposed mean flow @xmath98 , the difference @xmath129 may decrease to zero or even become negative .",
    "the sign of @xmath130 is related to interaction between the critical layer and rossby waves and may point to absorption ( @xmath131 ) , perfect reflection ( @xmath132 ) , or over - reflection ( @xmath133 ) of rossby waves by the critical layer ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "in the present dns , as well as in the previous studies by vallis and maltrud @xcite , the mean flow @xmath98 is generated and sustained by small scale random forcing , while @xmath130 is always positive .    in summary , it is useful to highlight the peculiarities caused by the nonlinear terms in barotropic vorticity equation on a @xmath0-plane .",
    "although the @xmath0-term does not enter the energy and enstrophy equations explicitly , it has a profound effect on the energy spectrum and spectral transfer .",
    "this effect is solely due to the nonlinearity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) which facilitates interaction between rossby waves and vorticity modes . as a result ,",
    "the energy spectrum and transfer develop strong anisotropy for @xmath134 while the inverse energy cascade extends to ever smaller @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , inside the dumb - bell shape ( [ five ] ) , where , by simple scaling considerations , the @xmath0-effect is expected to prevail , the energy spectrum is determined not by @xmath0 but by the presumably irrelevant parameter @xmath91 . on the other hand , in the small sectors around @xmath86 outside the dumb - bell shape",
    "naive considerations show that the @xmath6-term is vanishing [ @xmath135 as @xmath136 in ( 1 ) ] and the mechanism of anisotropic inverse transfer funnels energy into zonal jets . in the present dns",
    "we find that the zonal jets do indeed form , but the effect of the @xmath0-term does not diminish by any means : the spectrum of energy in the regions @xmath137 is determined by @xmath0 .",
    "the possibility of energy transfer from rossby waves to zonal flows has long been discussed in the literature and by no means is a trivial matter .",
    "straightforward generalization of the fjortoft theorem @xcite shows that a resonant triad of wavevectors one of which is aligned with the axis @xmath13 does not allow for direct energy transfer into zonal flows .",
    "however , the vector with @xmath4 facilitates energy exchange between the other two vectors - members of the triad .",
    "this fact was proved in @xcite in much more general way ; it was shown that the coupling coefficient is zero for any such triad that @xmath4 for one of the vectors .",
    "later , newell @xcite showed that rossby waves can transfer energy into zonal flows through a sideband resonance mechanism or through a quartet resonance . reinforcing this result ,",
    "the present dns indicate that not only energy transfer into zonal flows due to nonlinear interaction is possible , but in fact it is the dominant mechanism of @xmath0-plane turbulence on large scales .",
    "since dns of @xmath0-plane turbulence in the energy transfer subrange demands excessive computational resources even for relatively moderate resolution , les could be a viable alternative . for such les ,",
    "however , a sgs representation is crucial since not only should it accommodate inverse energy transfer but also it should account for the small scale energy forcing excluded in the explicit modes .",
    "following @xcite , an sgs representation for high wavenumber forced @xmath6-plane turbulence can be given by an anisotropic two - parametric viscosity , @xmath138 , defined by @xmath139 this two - parametric viscosity was calculated analytically using the renormalization group ( rg ) theory of turbulence @xcite ; it is shown in fig . 9 for the set of parameters corresponding to case 2 of dns .",
    "the behavior of the theoretically derived @xmath138 is quite similar to that obtained from dns as shown in fig .",
    "10 also for case 2 . for large @xmath25 ,",
    "the @xmath6-effect is weak , and @xmath140 behaves similarly to the isotropic case @xcite ; there is a sharp positive cusp and then @xmath140 becomes negative . as @xmath31 , the effect of the @xmath6-term becomes stronger ; @xmath141 remains negative in the vicinity of @xmath79 but increases to zero in other directions .",
    "the negativity of @xmath141 along @xmath142 is consistent with the strong energy flux into zonal jets as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is important to mention that when the dns integration was terminated , the low wavenumber end of the spectrum was not yet fully energy saturated .",
    "this fact explains the sharp increase in dns - derived @xmath138 at small @xmath117 evident in fig .",
    ". the sign - changing structure of @xmath138 is indicative of a physical space sgs representation which combines a negative laplacian and a positive ( dissipative ) hyperviscosity thus presenting an anisotropic version of the kuramoto ",
    "sivashinsky equation or snv sgs representation @xcite .",
    "the main ideas of the snv formulation are discussed in the next section as applied to les of more simple isotropic 2d turbulence .",
    "the isotropic snv sgs representation can be useful for les of @xmath6-plane turbulence with @xmath143 since deviation from isotropy is expected only for @xmath134 where , due to the factor of @xmath144 on the right hand side of ( 10 ) below , the sgs contribution is small .",
    "specific difficulties of les of 2d turbulence in the energy transfer subrange are that the sgs representation must simultaneously be consistent with the conservation laws for both energy and enstrophy ( or potential enstrophy ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , in les of the inverse energy cascade , the wavenumber modes of the energy source lie in the subgrid scales so that the sgs representation must assume the function of the forcing .",
    "the sgs schemes being used to date in both 3d and quasi-2d flows usually employ laplacian or higher order hyperviscosities that ensure sgs energy dissipation but not forcing . while such sgs are consistent with the dynamics of 3d turbulence where energy is directly cascaded from large to small scales where it dissipates , they can not be expected to work well in quasi-2d flows where energy cascades from small to large scales while the enstrophy is transferred in the opposite direction . a possible resolution to this problem",
    "can involve the replacement of the sgs forcing by force located in the explicitly resolved region near @xmath105 .",
    "however , this solution is not only quite cumbersome but also significantly distorts the explicit scales near @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , this approach is difficult for implementation in physical space , particularly for bounded systems and/or systems with spatially nonuniform energy sources .",
    "an alternative approach is offered by the snv representation developed in @xcite for isotropic 2d turbulence . in this approach , eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( with @xmath6 = 0 ) that includes small scale forcing @xmath11 is replaced by les equation @xmath145    here , eddy viscosity is identified with the two - parametric viscosity @xmath146 defined by ( 9 ) ( where , due to isotropy of the flow , the angular dependence is omitted ) . in @xcite",
    "it was found that this eddy viscosity is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the total enstrophy of the system and @xmath149 is plotted in fig .",
    "this formulation is designed to provide constant energy transfer with the rate @xmath150 .",
    "consistent with the eddy viscosity approach , the sgs representation ( 11 ) is a function of the flow . in a statistical steady state ,",
    "( 11 ) coincides with the two - parametric viscosity derived from the rg theory @xcite .    in a series of les that employ the formulation ( 11 ) together with a specially designed large scale drag that effectively removes energy that reaches the largest computational scales , it was found that simulations can be carried out nearly indefinitely ( being terminated after about 200 turnover times ) , while a very robust kolmogorov @xmath1 energy spectrum was established .    the formulation ( 11 ) can be simplified to make it more easily adaptable for simulations of quasi-2d flows in physical space .",
    "first , a two - term power series expansion in powers of @xmath151 that satisfies all necessary conservation laws can be derived from ( 11 ) @xcite , @xmath152.\\ ] ] here , the negative term in the square brackets accounts for the effect of the small scale forcing and inverse energy cascade .",
    "the second term describes dissipative processes and is equivalent to a biharmonic viscosity in physical space .",
    "then , ( 12 ) can be further simplified if @xmath153 in its dissipative term is replaced by the value obtained from the kolmogorov spectrum ( 4 ) .",
    "finally , the resulting sgs representation for 2d turbulence in the energy transfer subrange takes the form @xmath154 in figs 12 and 13 , we plot the results of les of 2d turbulence with the sgs representation ( 13 ) .",
    "one can see that the total energy and enstrophy oscillate slightly around their steady state values while a robust kolmogorov energy spectrum is established .",
    "the corresponding physical space representation of the sgs operator for quasi-2d flows in the energy subrange is obtained using the inverse fourier transform of ( 13 ) , @xmath155 where @xmath156 and where @xmath157 denotes the enstrophy averaged over an area adjacent to the grid cell , @xmath158 is the grid resolution , the laplacian term in ( 14 ) is written in the conservative form .",
    "since ( 14 ) includes two terms , a _ negative _ laplacian and positive ( in the sense of dissipation ) biharmonic , it is referred to as a _ stabilized negative viscosity _ ( snv ) formulation . generally , snv equations are far more complicated than equations of the kuramoto  sivashinsky type @xcite because in the former , the coefficients are not constant but , as in the classical eddy viscosity approach , are functions of the flow .",
    "in this paper , we describe results of direct numerical simulations of @xmath6-plane turbulence forced at small scales . as for isotropic",
    "2d turbulence , nonlinear interactions play a crucial role in the evolution and dynamics of @xmath6-plane turbulence on all scales and at all times .",
    "the effect of the small scale forcing propagates to ever larger scales due to the inverse energy cascade . on relatively small scales , @xmath159 ,",
    "the flow is nearly isotropic and behaves like classical 2d turbulence . for",
    "modes with eddy turnover times comparable with the rossby wave period , the turbulence energy spectrum begins to develop anisotropy that increases for @xmath31 .",
    "it is found that for almost all @xmath2 except for the small vicinity of @xmath160 , the spectrum of turbulence is kolmogorov - like , @xmath161 . around @xmath160 , or @xmath162 ,",
    "the two - parametric energy transfer function @xmath163 attains a sharp maximum , which indicates that there is a strongly anisotropic energy transfer into quasi - one - dimensional ( zonal ) structures .",
    "these zonal flows are generated and sustained by nonlinear processes , particularly , anisotropic inverse energy cascade . for @xmath164 ,",
    "the energy spectrum becomes very steep , @xmath165 , as was first suggested by rhines @xcite .",
    "the steepening of the spectrum slows down flow evolution , to the extent that dns even with relatively moderate resolution becomes computationally prohibitive .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved through les of @xmath6-plane turbulence . for such les ,",

    "<S> the effect of small scale forcing on large scale structures in @xmath0-plane two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence is studied using long - term direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nonlinear effects remain strong at all times and for all scales and establish an inverse energy cascade that extends to the largest scales available in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale flow develops strong spectral anisotropy : @xmath1 kolmogorov scaling holds for almost all @xmath2 , @xmath3 , except in the small vicinity of @xmath4 , where rhines s @xmath5 scaling prevails . due to the @xmath5 scaling , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral evolution of @xmath0-plane turbulence becomes extremely slow which , perhaps , explains why this scaling law has never before been observed in dns . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with different values of @xmath0 indicate that the @xmath0-effect diminishes at small scales where the flow is nearly isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for simulations of @xmath6-plane turbulence forced at small scales sufficiently removed from the scales where @xmath6-effect is strong , large eddy simulation ( les ) can be used . </S>",
    "<S> a subgrid scale ( sgs ) parameterization for such les must account for the small scale forcing that is not explicitly resolved and correctly accommodate two inviscid conservation laws , viz . energy and enstrophy . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement gives rise to a new anisotropic stabilized negative viscosity ( snv ) sgs representation which is discussed in the context of les of isotropic 2d turbulence .    </S>",
