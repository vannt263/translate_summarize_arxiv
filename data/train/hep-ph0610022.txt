    "the precise determination of the machine luminosity is an important ingredient for the successful achievement of the physics programme at the @xmath2 colliders running with center of mass energy in the range of the low lying hadronic resonances .",
    "one of the most important challenges is the precise measure of the @xmath3 ratio , by means of the energy scan or the radiative return method .",
    "the aim is to reduce the theoretical error on the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization , which reflects on the error of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath4 and the qed coupling constant at the @xmath5 peak @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the precise measure of @xmath3 will give a stringent test of the standard model predictions .    in order to achieve a precise determination of the collider luminosity ,",
    "high - precision calculations of the qed processes @xmath7 , and relative monte carlo generators , are required .",
    "the large - angle bhabha process is , in particular , of major interest for its large cross section and its clean experimental signature .",
    "the event generator @xmath0  was developed  @xcite to this end and it is widely used by experimental collaborations .",
    "the event generators @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite are also employed by experimental collaborations .",
    "the theoretical precision of the @xmath0  event generator for the bhabha process was estimated at the 0.5% level  @xcite .",
    "the need of an improvement in the calculation of radiative corrections within @xmath0  emerged in the last years , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the total luminosity error quoted by kloe is presently 0.6%  @xcite , where the dominant source of uncertainty comes from theory , i.e. from the 0.5% physical precision of the @xmath0  generator .",
    "secondly , the measurement of the hadronic cross section in the @xmath11 channel at vepp-2 m has achieved a total systematic uncertainty of 0.6% , requiring an assessment of the collider luminosity at the level of 0.1% .",
    "last but not least , precision measurements of @xmath3 trough radiative return at kek - b and pep - ii are already performed or foreseen in the near future .    here , we describe the main features of a high - precision calculation of photonic radiative corrections to the bhabha process , in order to improve the theoretical formulation of the original @xmath0generator up to @xmath12(0.1% ) .",
    "the approach is based on the matching of exact next - to - leading ( @xmath1 ) order corrections with resummation through all orders of @xmath13 of the leading contributions due to multiple radiation , taken into account according to a qed parton shower ( ps ) .",
    "the original version of @xmath0  ( @xmath14 ) is based on a ps in qed which allows to calculate the photonic radiative corrections to the bhabha process .",
    "the ps is a numerical algorithm which exactly solves the dglap equation for the electron structure function ( sf ) in qed , allowing to include essentially the leading logarithmic ( ll ) corrections to the cross section up to all orders of @xmath13 .",
    "the main advantage of the ps approach is that , thanks to its monte carlo nature , the events can be generated exclusively , i.e. all the momenta of the final state particles ( fermions and an indefinite number of photons ) can be reconstructed .",
    "the ps can be improved to account also for interference effects between initial and final state radiation , allowing thus for a more accurate description of the radiative events  @xcite .",
    "the corrected differential cross section in the ps approach can be written ( in a simplified form for the sake of clarity ) as @xmath15 \\big\\}\\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are identically equal to 1 in the pure ps case , @xmath18 is the sudakov form factor ( @xmath19 is the scale in the collinear logarithm @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the altarelli - parisi splitting function , @xmath23 is the energy fraction carried by the @xmath24 photon , @xmath25 is an infrared separator ( the integrated cross section is independent from its value ) and @xmath26 is the photon angular spectrum function including initial - final state interference . in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) the photonic radiative corrections are resummed up to all orders , in the ll accuracy .    the expansion at @xmath1  of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is @xmath27_{{\\cal o}(\\alpha)}d\\sigma_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}d\\hat\\sigma_0dxdc\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & p(x)i(k)\\theta(x-\\varepsilon)=d\\sigma_{sv}^{\\alpha , ps } + d\\sigma_{h}^{\\alpha , ps}\\label{psoal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath28 defines the cross section with the emission of a virtual or soft photon ( with energy fraction lower than @xmath25 ) and @xmath29 defines the hard bremsstrahlung cross section ( with energy larger than @xmath25 ) .",
    "the ps error is due to the fact that both the soft plus virtual and hard part are approximated at the ll accuracy . by comparing the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ psoal ] ) with the exact @xmath1  cross section it was possible to establish that the theoretical accuracy of @xmath0  was at @xmath30 .    in order to go beyond the ll approximation and preserve the resummation of the higher orders ( h.o . ) corrections , an appropriate procedure must be devised , able to avoid the double counting of the ll contributions and guarantee the independence of the cross section from the @xmath25 parameter . a solution to this problem",
    "can be obtained by setting the factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 to @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the complete expressions for the soft plus virtual @xmath1  cross section  @xcite and the real one photon emission cross section . by construction , the factors of eq .",
    "( [ ffactors ] ) are infrared safe quantities and they let the @xmath1  expansion of @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) coincide with the exact @xmath1  cross section .",
    "it is worth noticing that correcting each single photon emission with a factor @xmath17 is crucial to make the cross section independent from the @xmath25 parameter and that the correction is larger in those phase space regions where the ps is more unreliable , typically where the photon is hard and/or not collinear to one of the charged particles .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is cast in a completely differential form , so that events can be generated exclusively as in the pure ps approach .    a more detailed discussion of the matching procedure , as well as its implementation in @xmath0 ,",
    "is presented in ref .",
    "in order to check the technical implementation and the physical accuracy of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) in the new @xmath0  @xcite , the generator has been compared with independent calculations , namely @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath10  and the old @xmath14 release , tuning the relevant input parameters . in @xmath35 , which is not a true event generator , the corrected cross section is calculated as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and the structure functions in the strictly collinear limit are used : thus @xmath1  corrections are included exactly and h.o .",
    "are included in the collinear limit with ll accuracy .",
    "@xmath10  is an event generator based on the yfs formalism to exponentiate exact @xmath1  corrections . here ,",

    "the results presented the previous section clearly demonstrate that the matching procedure of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) has the desired behaviour of including the missing @xmath1  contributions in the ps algorithm while preserving the resummation of all h.o .",
    "they also demonstrate that the not trivial monte carlo implementation of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is correctly realized and robust .    the theoretical error of @xmath0  is now shifted at the two loop level , to terms of the order of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 at 1 gev ) , without any infrared enhancement .    in  @xcite , a critical and systematic discussion of the remaining theoretical error will be presented .",
    "once the vacuum polarization is ( easily ) included in the @xmath0  formulation , the formulae can be expanded at order @xmath47 and consistently compared with the recent calculation of refs .",
    "@xcite , where relevant contributions to the complete two loop corrections to bhabha scattering are computed .",
    "it is worth noticing that in refs .",
    "@xcite the real photon radiation is accounted only in the soft limit and that at two loop level also the emission of real @xmath2 pairs has to be carefully considered .",
    "however , preliminary studies and tests show that the missing @xmath48 contributions have an impact not larger than the 0.1% on the integrated cross section if typical event selection criteria for luminometry at flavour factories are applied .",
    "these considerations suggest that a conservative estimate of the theoretical error of the improved @xmath0  can be fixed at 0.2% .",
    "an improved version of the event generator @xmath0  is now available  @xcite , where an original matching of the qed ps and the exact @xmath1  matrix element is implemented in order to go beyond the ll approximation intrinsic to the ps approach .",
    "the @xmath0  theoretical error for the bhabha cross section calculation at flavour factories is reduced from the 0.5% down to 0.2% ( conservatively estimated ) .",
