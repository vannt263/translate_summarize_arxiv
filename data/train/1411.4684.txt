    "seeds of multifractals were sown in b. mandelbrot s works on multiplicative chaos in 1970 s @xcite .",

    "the concept of multifractality came from geophysics and theoretical physics . at the beginning ,",
    "u. frisch and g. parisi  @xcite , h. g. hentschel and i. procaccia  @xcite had the rather vague idea of mixture of subsets of different dimensions each of which has a given hlder singularity exponent .",

    "the multifractal formalism is tightly related to the thermodynamics and d. ruelle @xcite was the first to use the thermodynamical formalism to compute the hausdorff dimensions of some julia sets .",
    "the research on the subject has been very active and very fruitful since four decades .",
    "the first most studied multifractal quantity is the local dimension of a borel measure @xmath11 on @xmath3 .",
    "recall that the local lower dimension of @xmath11 at @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the ball centered at @xmath2 with radius @xmath15 .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to present some problems in the multifractal analysis of birkhoff ergodic averages , especially of multiple birkhoff ergodic averages , and some related topics like dimensions of measures and riesz products as tools , and oriented walks as similar subject .",
    "let @xmath28 be a map from @xmath3 into @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the dynamical system @xmath29 .",
    "the main concern about the system is the behavior of an orbit @xmath30 of a given point @xmath12 .",
    "some aspects of the behavior of the orbit may be described by the so - called birkhoff averages @xmath31 where @xmath18 is a given function , called observable .",
    "we refer to @xcite for basic facts in the theory of dynamical system and ergodic theory .",
    "the famous and fundamental birkhoff ergodic theorem states that for any @xmath32-invariant ergodic probability measure @xmath11 on @xmath3 and for any integrable function @xmath33 , the limit @xmath34 holds for @xmath11-almost all points @xmath12 .",
    "even if @xmath11 is only @xmath32-invariant but not ergodic , the limit still exists for @xmath11-almost all points @xmath12 . for many dynamical systems",
    ", there is a rich class of invariant measures and so that the limit of birkhoff averages @xmath35 may vary for different points @xmath2 .",
    "this variety reflects the chaotic feature of the dynamical system .",
    "a typical example is the doubling dynamics @xmath36 on the unit circle @xmath37 .",

    "nice \" we mean that the measure is supported by @xmath44 and its dimension is equal to that of @xmath44 . the dimension of a measure is defined to be the dimension of the  smallest \" borel support of the measure . therefore the nice measure is a maximal measure in the sense that it attains the maximum among all measures supported by @xmath44 .",
    "this maximal measure may be invariant , ergodic and even mixing .",
    "some other nice properties are also shared by the maximal measure . for this well",
    "studied classic ergodic averages , see for example @xcite .",
    "let us also mention some useful tools for dimension estimation @xcite .",
    "the multiple ergodic theory started almost at the same time of the development of multifractal analysis .",
    "it started with frstenberg s proof of szemerdi theorem on the existence of arbitrary long arithmetic sequence in a set of integers of positive density @xcite .",
    "this theory involves several dynamics rather than one dynamics .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ... , @xmath47 be @xmath48 transformations on a space @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that they are commuting each other and preserving a given probability measure @xmath11 . for @xmath48 measurable functions",
    "@xmath49 we define the multiple birkhoff averages by @xmath50 an inspiring example is the couple @xmath51 on the circle @xmath52 where @xmath53    the mixture of the dynamics @xmath54 is much more difficult to understand . after the first works of frstenberg - weiss @xcite and of conze - lesigne @xcite , b. host and b. kra @xcite proved the @xmath55-convergence of @xmath56 when @xmath57 ( powers of a fixed dynamics ) and @xmath58 . for the almost every convergence , results are sparse .",
    "j. bourgain proved the almost everywhere convergence when @xmath59 .",
    "we should point out that even if the limit exists , it is not easy to recognize the limit . in particular , the limit may not be constant for some ergodic measures . for nilsystems , explicit formula for the limit",
    "was known to e. lesigne @xcite and t. ziegler @xcite .",
    "anyway , not like the `` simple '' ergodic theory , the multiple ergodic theory has not yet reached its maturity .",
    "although the multiple ergodic theory has been still developing , this situation does nt prevent us from investigating the multifractal feature of multiple systems .",
    "let us consider the following general set - up .",
    "for a given observable @xmath60 , we consider the multiple ergodic averages @xmath61 the birkhoff averages ( [ def_generalergaverage-0 ] ) correspond to the special case of tensor product @xmath62 .",
    "it is natural to introduce the following generalization of multifractal spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider the case where @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "so @xmath65 the multiple hausdorff spectrum of the observable @xmath66 is defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68    as we said , the classical theory ( @xmath69 ) is well developed .",
    "when @xmath70 , there are several results on the multifractal analysis of the limit of the averages @xmath71 in some special cases ; but questions remain largely unanswered . in section 2 , we will present the first results obtained in @xcite in a very special case which give us a feeling of the problem and illustrate the difficulty of the problem .",
    "one result is the hausdorff spectrum obtained by using riesz products , a tool borrowed from fourier analysis .",
    "another result concerns the box dimension of a multiplicatively invariant set .",
    "these two kinds of result are respectively generalized in @xcite and @xcite in some general setting . in section 5",
    ", we will present these results .",
    "as we mentioned , the local dimension of a measure was the first study object of multifractal analysis . in section 3 , we will give an account of dimensions of measures which are related to the local dimension and have their own interests .",
    "the idea of using riesz products is inspired by a work on oriented walks @xcite to which section 4 will be devoted . in the last section , we will collect some remarks and open problems .",
    "the question of computing the dimension of @xmath72 was raised by fan , liao and ma in @xcite , where the following special case was studied : @xmath73 , @xmath32 is the shift , @xmath74 and @xmath66 is the function @xmath75 note that @xmath76 is the first coordinate of @xmath77 .",
    "we consider @xmath78 as the infinite product of the multiplicative group @xmath79 .",
    "then the function @xmath80 is a group character of @xmath78 , called rademacher function and @xmath81 is also a group character , called walsh function . recall that @xmath82 , considered as a symbolic space , is endowed with the metric @xmath83      under the above assumption , we have the following result .",
    "( @xcite)[thm_flm ] for every @xmath84 $ ] , the set @xmath85 has the hausdorff dimension @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "a key observation is that all these walsh functions constitute a dissociated system in the sense of hewitt - zuckermann @xcite .",
    "this allows us to define probability measures called riesz products on the group @xmath78 : @xmath88 for @xmath89 $ ] , where @xmath90 denote the haar measure on @xmath78 .",
    "fortunately , the riesz product @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is a maximizing measure on @xmath93 .",
    "so , by computing the dimension of the measure @xmath91 , we get the stated formula .",
    "we will go back to riesz products in section  [ sect_dim ] and to dimensions of measures in section  [ sect_ow ] .",
    "note that the case @xmath69 is nothing but the well - known besicovich - eggleston theorem dated back to 1940 s , which would be considered as the first result of multifractal analysis .",
    "the very motivation of @xcite was the multiple ergodic averages in the following case where @xmath94 , @xmath32 is the shift on @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the space @xmath95 may also be considered as the infinite product group of @xmath99 .",
    "but the function @xmath100 is no longer group character and the fourier method fails .",
    "then the authors of @xcite proposed to look at a subset of the @xmath101-level set @xmath102 the proposed subset is @xmath103 this set @xmath104 has a nicer structure than @xmath105 .",
    "the condition @xmath106 is imposed to all integers @xmath107 without exception for all points @xmath2 in @xmath104 , while the same condition is imposed to `` most '' integers @xmath107 for points @xmath2 in @xmath105 .",

    "look at the definition of @xmath104 .",
    "the value of the digit @xmath114 of an element @xmath115 has an impact on the value of @xmath116 , which in turn on the value of @xmath117 , ... and so forth on the values of @xmath118 for all @xmath119 .",
    "but it has no influence on @xmath120 , @xmath121 , ... .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath122 for an odd integer @xmath123 only has influence on @xmath124 .",
    "this suggests us the following partition @xmath125 we could say that the defining conditions of @xmath104 restricted to different @xmath126 are independent .",
    "we are then led to investigate , for each odd number @xmath123 , the restriction of @xmath2 to @xmath126 which will be denoted by @xmath127 if we rewrite @xmath128 , which is considered as a point in @xmath95 , then @xmath129 belongs to the subshift of finite type subjected to @xmath130 .",

    "multifractal properties were first investigated for measures .",
    "the multifractal analysis of a measure is the analysis of the local dimension on the whole space , while the dimensions of a measure concern with what happens on a borel support of the measure . in @xcite , lower and",
