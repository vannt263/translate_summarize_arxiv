    "the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei at intermediate energies provides relevant information on the axial hadronic currents .",
    "the predicted cross sections for charged current ( cc ) quasielastic ( qe ) scattering are very similar for most theoretical models though , however , they are clearly below the recently published miniboone data  @xcite . actually , the cross section per nucleon on @xmath3c is clearly larger than for free nucleons .",
    "the discrepancy is large enough to provoke much debate and theoretical attention .",
    "some works try to understand these new data in terms of a larger value of @xmath1 ( nucleon axial mass ) around 1.31.4 gev  @xcite .",
    "these large values are not only difficult to accommodate theoretically , but are also in conflict with the value for @xmath4 gev that is usually quoted as the world average  @xcite .    in most theoretical works qe is used for processes where the gauge boson @xmath5 is absorbed by just one nucleon , which together with a lepton is emitted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : expl]a ) .",
    "however , in the recent miniboone measurements , qe is related to processes in which only a muon is detected .",
    "this latter definition could make sense because ejected nucleons are not detected in that experiment , but includes multinucleon processes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : expl]b ) and others like pion production followed by absorption .",
    "however , it discards pions coming off the nucleus , since they will give rise to additional leptons after their decay ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : expl]c ) . in any case",
    ", their experimental results can not be directly compared to most previous calculations , as it was first pointed out by m. martini et al .",

    "mechanisms for @xmath5 absorption inside of a nucleus . ]    in this talk , we present a microscopic calculation of the ccqe - like double differential cross section @xmath6 measured by miniboone and we will use these data to extract @xmath1 .",
    "we will estimate the ccqe - like cross section by the sum of the theoretical qe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expl]a ) cross section and that induced by multinucleon mechanisms , as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : expl]b , where the gauge boson is being absorbed by two or more nucleons without producing pions .",
    "first we pay attention to the total cross section and compare our results with the unfolded data of ref .",
    "our microscopic model , derived in refs .  @xcite and  @xcite , starts from a relativistic local fermi gas ( lfg ) picture of the nucleus , which accounts for pauli blocking and fermi motion .",
    "the qe contribution was studied in @xcite incorporating several nuclear effects .",
    "the main one is the medium polarization ( rpa ) , including @xmath7-hole degrees of freedom and explicit @xmath8 and @xmath9 meson exchanges in the vector - isovector channel of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction . the model for multinucleon mechanisms ( not properly qe but included in the miniboone data  @xcite ) is fully discussed in ref .",
    "the model includes one , two , and even three - nucleon mechanisms , as well as the excitation of @xmath7 isobars .",
    "there are no free parameters in the description of nuclear effects , since they were fixed in previous studies of photon , electron , and pion interactions with nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical model has proved to be quite successful in the study of nuclear reactions with photon  @xcite , pion  @xcite and electron  @xcite probes .    up",
    "to neutrino energies around 1 gev , the predictions of our model compare rather well , taking into account experimental and theoretical uncertainties , with the recent data published by the sciboone collaboration for total neutrino inclusive cross sections  @xcite .",
    "results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : incl ] taken from ref .",
    "there , it can also be appreciated how at larger energies , we underestimate the cross section .",
    "indeed , we could observe that some @xmath10 contributions neglected in our model , become relatively important at these higher energies .",
    "our predictions  @xcite for the flux - unfolded muon neutrino s ccqe - like cross section on @xmath3c measured in  @xcite are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mb ] .",
    "the first observation is that our qe curve misses the data - points , being our predicted qe cross sections significantly smaller than those reported by the miniboone collaboration .",
    "however , when multinucleon knock out contributions are added to the qe prediction of  @xcite , we obtain the solid green line in a better agreement with the miniboone data . in these calculations , @xmath1 is fixed to 1.05 gev .",
    "thus we confirm the findings of @xcite on the crucial role played by the multinucleon mechanisms in the ccqe - like miniboone data , and that when these latter processes are considered , high values of @xmath1 in the 1.3 - 1.4 gev range are not needed to describe the data .",
    "our evaluation of these pionless multinucleon emission contributions to the cross section is fully microscopical and it contains terms , which were either not considered or only approximately taken into account in @xcite .    flux - unfolded miniboone @xmath11 ccqe cross section per neutron , together with different theoretical predictions from ref .",

    "furthermore , the unfolded cross section is not a very clean observable after noticing the importance of multinucleon mechanisms , because the unfolding itself is model dependent and assumes that the events are purely qe . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show our results for the miniboone neutrino flux folded ccqe - like @xmath0 distribution with @xmath17 gev ( value used in our previous works ) .",
    "the full ( qe+multinucleon mechanisms ) model agrees remarkably well with these data , despite of that no parameters have been fitted to data , beyond of a global scale , @xmath18 .",
    "the inclusion of this scale @xmath18 takes into account the global normalization uncertainty of around 10% acknowledged in  @xcite .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "though the consistency of miniboone data with standard values of @xmath1 has been established now , one could still go further and use our full model to fit the data letting @xmath1 to be a free parameter .",
    "we get @xmath19 gev and @xmath15 with a strong correlation between both parameters .",
    "the inclusion of multinucleon mechanisms and rpa is essential to obtain axial masses consistent with the world average .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where one can see that rpa strongly decreases the cross section at low energies , while multinucleon mechanisms accumulate their contribution at low muon energies and compensate that depletion .",
    "therefore , the final picture is that of a delicate balance between a dominant single nucleon scattering , corrected by collective effects , and other mechanisms that involve directly two or more nucleons . both effects can be mimicked by using a large @xmath1 value ( lfg entry in table  [ tabla ] ) .",
    "we also see that the proportion of multinucleon events contributing to the qe - like signal is quite large for low muon energies and thus , the algorithm used to reconstruct the neutrino energy is badly suited for this region .",
