    "discovery of planets around other stars is now well underway . over 1000 extrasolar planets",
    "have been found mainly by ground - based radial velocity ( rv ) measurements and space- and ground - based photometric transit surveys ( ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 `` planet candidates '' have been found by kepler ( _ batalha et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ; updates as of november 2013 ) .",
    "due to instrument sensitivity the first planets detected were predominantly gas or ice giants , like jupiter or neptune .",
    "recent work by _",
    "howard _ ( 2013 ) and _ fressin et al . _",
    "( 2013 ) show that small transiting planets are more numerous than big ones .",
    "some potentially rocky planets have been identified ( _ lger et al . , _",
    "2009 ; _ batalha et al . , _ 2011 , _ borucki et al . , _ 2013 ) .",
    "several planets with minimum masses consistent with rocky planets have been found mostly around cooler stars , including planets in the habitable zones ( _ pepe et al .",
    "_ 2011 ; _ anglada - escud et al . _ , 2012 ;",
    "_ bonfils et al . , _ 2013 ) , as these stars are less massive and smaller , and hence more easily accelerated by small planets , and show an improved planet / star contrast ratio in the photometric transit method .",
    "the search is now on for rocky planets around fgkm stars .",
    "a handful of these have already been found ( _ buchhave et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; see also website exoplanets.org ) .",
    "this search is difficult to do by rv because the induced stellar velocities are small .",
    "kepler can find close - in rocky planets around fgk stars rather easily compared to planets at larger radii .",
    "however , small , potentially rocky planets in the habitable zone are difficult to verify , since most of the solar - like stars are noisier than the sun , and those identified by kepler are far away , hence dim ( _ gilliland et al . , _ 2011 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the first few transiting planets with radii consistent with rocky planets have been recently detected in habitable zones ( _ borucki et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ; _ kopparapu _ , 2013 ; _ kaltenegger et al . ,",
    "_ 2013 ) .",
    "in this chapter we are concerned with habitable planets .",
    "below , we expand on what we mean by that term .",
    "a fundamental requirement of habitability , though  perhaps the only indisputable requirement  is that the planet must have a solid or liquid surface to provide stable pressure - temperature conditions . in his book cosmos , carl sagan imagined hypothetical bag - like creatures that could live on jupiter by adjusting their height in the atmosphere , just as some fish can adjust their depth in earth s oceans using air bladders .",
    "but one needs to ask how such creatures might possibly evolve .",
    "single - celled organisms could not maintain their altitude on a gas or ice giant planet , and hence would eventually be wafted up to the very cold ( unless it was a hot jupiter ) upper atmosphere or down into the hot interior .",
    "here we assume that sagan s gas giant life forms do not exist , and we focus our attention on rocky planets .",
    "habitability for extrasolar planets is usually defined by liquid water on the surface of a rocky planet .",
    "other liquids can be imagined , as discussed below .",
    "furthermore , water may exist also subsurface , as , e.g. , expected for jupiter s icy moon europa , which would make such a body also potentially habitable . in terms of exoplanets , however , such sub - surface life would be very difficult to detect , and we neglect it here .",
    "to begin , we must define what constitutes a rocky planet .",
    "that definition is easy enough if you can characterize the planet the way we do for objects in our own solar system : it must have a solid or liquid surface .",
    "but if one knows only the planet s minimum mass ( from rv ) or its diameter ( from transits ) , this question becomes more difficult .",
    "astrophysical theory predicts that planets that grow larger than about 10 earth masses during the time that the stellar nebula is still around will capture significant amounts of gas and turn into gas or ice giants ( _ mizuno et al .",
    "_ , 1978 ; _ pollack et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "the theory is not robust , however , because the opacity calculations within the accreting atmosphere are complex and did not include such phenomena as collision - induced absorption of ir radiation by molecular hydrogen , and because it does not exclude higher - mass planets that complete the process of accretion after the nebular gas has disappeared . similarly , measurement of a planet s diameter via the transit method does not distinguish conclusively between a rocky planet like earth or an ice giant like neptune .",
    "neptune s diameter is about 4 times that of earth .",
    "initial data indicate that planets with radii below @xmath1 are rocky .",
    "the kepler team assumes that planets with diameters @xmath2 are ice giants .",
    "once we are sure that a planet is rocky , the next most fundamental requirement for life as we know it is that it should have access to liquid water .",
    "even though some terrestrial organisms  those that form spores , for example  can persist for long time intervals without water , all terrestrial life forms require liquid water to metabolize and reproduce .",
    "there are good biochemical reasons for this dependence .",
    "most importantly , water is a highly polar solvent that can dissolve the polar molecules on which carbon - based life depends .",
    "that said , researchers do not completely discount the possibility that alien life forms might have different biochemistries ( _ baross et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; _ national academy of sciences _ , 2007 ) .",
    "carbon has a more complex chemistry than any other element , and so most workers agree that alien life would also be carbon - based .",
    "other chain building elements like silicon and phosphorus exist , but are less energetically favorable than c in this respect . among alternative solvents ,",
    "even liquid ch@xmath3 is considered by some workers to be a possible medium in which life might exist ; hence , the interest in saturn s moon titan , which has lakes of liquid methane on its surface .",
    "liquid methane is only stable at very low temperatures , though , and so any organic chemistry in it may be too slow to create or to power life .",
    "we suspect that liquid water , or some mixture containing liquid water , is needed to support all forms of life .",
    "confining our interest to planets with liquid water is not all that restrictive .",
    "oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe , and so many , or most , rocky planets are probably endowed with appreciable amounts of water when they form ( e.g. , _ raymond et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) . in our own solar system ,",
    "mercury and venus lack liquid water , while earth and mars have it although modern mars has no liquid water in amounts sufficient to develop life .",
    "the lack of water on the innermost two planets is easily explained , though , as these planets lie outside the boundaries of the habitable zone  the region around a star where liquid water can be present on a planet s surface ( _ hart _ , 1979 ; _ kasting et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) .",
    "mars lacks liquid water on its surface today , but shows evidence that water flowed there earlier in its history . and mars may have liquid water in its subsurface .",
    "mars internal heat flow is thought to be about 1/3rd that of earth ( _ montsi and zuber _ , 2003 ) ; hence , depending on the thermal conductivity of the regolith , mars could have liquid water within a few kilometers of the surface .    as astronomers , we are interested in discovering life on extrasolar planets . for the foreseeable future ,",
    "at least , such planets can only be studied remotely , by doing spectroscopy on their atmospheres using big telescopes on the ground or , more likely , in space .",
    "for us to detect life on an exoplanet , that life must be able to modify the planet s atmosphere in such a way that we can detect it , as it has done here on earth .",
    "earth s atmosphere contains 21% o@xmath4 and 1.7 ppmv ch@xmath3 , both of which are produced almost entirely by organisms .",
    "the maintenance of extreme disequilibrium in a planet s atmosphere , and specifically the coexistence of free o@xmath4 with reduced gases such as ch@xmath3 or n@xmath4o , was suggested many years ago as the best remote evidence for life ( _ lederberg _ , 1965 ; _ lovelock _ , 1965 ) .",
    "if we wish to propose a testable hypothesis about life on other planets , we should therefore restrict our attention to planets like earth that have liquid water on their surfaces .",
    "this allows for the possibility that photosynthetic life might flourish there , greatly increasing productivity ( _ kharecha et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) , and possibly producing atmospheric biosignatures that we might one day detect .    from a practical standpoint ,",
    "then , this means that we should design our astronomical searches to look for planets lying within the conventional liquid water habitable zone ( hz ) of their parent star .",
    "this is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition , as factors such as volatile inventories , high - energy radiation , magnetospheres , and stellar winds may further constrain habitability , as discussed further in this chapter .",
    "the boundaries of the hz were estimated by _ kasting et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) based on 1-d climate modeling calculations for earth - like planets .",
    "these calculations were done with a cloud - free model ( clouds were `` painted '' on the ground ) and they assumed fully saturated tropospheres .",
    "conservatively , planets may lose their water when they lie closer to the star than the `` moist greenhouse '' limit . at this distance , @xmath5  au in these old calculations , a planet s stratosphere becomes wet , and the water is lost by photodissociation followed by escape of hydrogen to space .",
    "a more strict limit of the inner edge of the habitable zone is the so - called runaway greenhouse limit . at this limit",
    "the entire water ocean of the earth would reside within the atmosphere due to the self - enhancing water vapor feedback cycle .",
    "the outer edge of the hz is defined by the `` maximum greenhouse '' limit , beyond which a co@xmath4-h@xmath4o greenhouse is no longer capable of maintaining a warm surface .",
    "this limit is based on the assumption that an earth - like planet will have volcanoes that emit co@xmath4 and that co@xmath4 will accumulate in the planet s atmosphere as the surface becomes cold .",
    "but , at some point , co@xmath4 will begin to condense out of the planet s atmosphere , limiting the range of distances over which this feedback process works . in these old calculations ,",
    "the maximum greenhouse limit occurs at @xmath6  au for our sun .",
    "the `` 1st co@xmath4 condensation '' limit of _ kasting et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) is no longer considered valid , because co@xmath4 clouds are now thought to usually warm a planet s surface ( _ forget and pierrehumbert _",
    ", 1997 ; _ mischna et al .",
    ". _ kitzmann et al . _",
    "( 2013 ) , however , suggest that the warming effect may have been overestimated in some cases .",
    "more optimistic empirical limits on the hz are derived from the observation that early mars appears to lie within it , and venus could conceivably have been within it prior to @xmath7 billion years ago .",
    "an even more optimistic outer edge has been suggested for the hz by _ seager _ ( 2013 ) , based on a calculation by _ pierrehumbert and gaidos _ ( 2011 ) showing that super - earths with dense captured h@xmath4 atmospheres could remain habitable out to as far as 10  au in our solar system .",
    "such planets will remain speculative , however , until they are observed , and one would not want to count on their existence while defining the requirements for a telescope to search for extrasolar life ( _ kasting et al . _ , 2014 ) .",
    "recently , _",
    "kopparapu et al . _",
    "( 2013 ) rederived the hz boundaries using a new 1-d climate model based on the hitemp database for h@xmath4o .",
    "hitemp differs from the older hitran database by including many more weak absorption lines , including some that extend all the way down to near - uv wavelengths .",
    "they furthermore included a new formulation of the water vapor continuum by _ paynter and ramaswamy _",
    "this causes the albedo of an h@xmath4o - rich atmosphere to be substantially lower than previously calculated .",
    "consequently , the moist greenhouse limit for the inner edge moves out to 0.99  au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kopparapu ] ) .",
    "this does not indicate that earth is actually that close to it , as these calculations continue to assume a fully saturated troposphere and to omit cloud feedback ( _ kitzmann et al .",

    "n is a constituent of both the amino acids in proteins and the nucleic acids in rna and dna .",
    "p is needed for the phosphate linkages between nucleotides in the latter two compounds , and s is needed for some particular amino acids .",
    "the compounds formed by these elements are termed volatiles because they are typically gases or liquids at room temperature .",
    "habitable planets therefore require sources of volatiles .",
    "volatiles are mostly thought to have originated from the asteroid belt or beyond ( _ morbidelli et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; _ raymond et al . _ , 2004 ) ; hence , modes of planetary accretion must be considered . to hold onto its water , a planet needs an atmosphere in addition to h@xmath4o vapor .",
    "planets that are too small , like mars , are thought to lose their atmospheres by various thermal and non - thermal processes , as discussed later in this chapter .",
    "planetary magnetic fields may also be important .",
    "mars , which lacks an intrinsic magnetic field , has had much of its atmosphere stripped by direct interaction with the solar wind .",
    "venus , on the other hand , also lacks an intrinsic magnetic field ; yet it has successfully held onto its dense co@xmath4 atmosphere , suggesting that planetary size is important .",
    "atmospheric composition may also be important , as a less co@xmath4-rich atmosphere on venus would have been hotter and more extended in its upper parts and may not have been as well retained . in the following sections of this chapter , we discuss in more detail various factors that contribute to planetary habitability .",
    "we focus on _ astrophysical _ conditions , while geophysical factors ( such as internal heat sources , plate tectonics , land mass fraction , outgassing , volcanism or magnetic dynamos ) , lower - atmosphere issues ( climate , winds , clouds ) , or biological conditions ( damaging radiation doses , extreme biological environments ) are not considered here .",
    "* 3.1 dynamics and stability *    the evolution of a biosphere is a very gradual process occurring over long time intervals .",
    "the long - term stability of a terrestrial planet moving in the hz is therefore certainly one of the basic requirements for the formation of life on such a planet .",
    "the eccentricity of a planetary orbit is a crucial factor in orbital dynamics because only a sufficiently small value guarantees that the planet remains within the hz .",
    "however , to assure appropriate conditions for habitability , the dynamics of the whole planetary system matter . for extensive reviews ,",
    "we refer the reader to the chapters by _ raymond et al .",

    "_ , _ benz et al .",
    "_ , and _ davies et al . _ in this volume .",
    "we focus on selected issues directly relevant for habitable - zone planets here",
    ".    observations of planetary systems and numerical studies indicate that planets are not born where we find them today",
    ". simulations of the late stage of formation of the outer solar system show that the giant planets arrived at their current configuration through a phase of orbital instability . the so - called _ nice models _ ( e.g. , _",
    "tsiganis et al . _ , 2005 , _ morbidelli et al . _ , 2007 )",
    "provide the best - matching results for the final configuration of the outer solar system .",
    "these simulations start with a more compact system of the four giant planets ( in a multi - resonant configuration in the latest version ) ; it then experiences slight changes in the orbits due to planetesimal - driven migration leading to a resonance crossing of saturn .",
    "this crossing causes an unstable phase for the giant planets with faster migration toward the final orbits . while during planetesimal - driven migration dynamical friction dampens orbit eccentricities , the resonance crossing will increase eccentricities and the orbits will diverge from each other ( _ chiang _ , 2003 ; _ tsiganis et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "since jupiter and saturn exert a strong influence on the inner solar system through secular perturbations , a change of the orbital separation of the two giant planets will modify the secular frequencies of their orbits .",
    "for example , _ pilat - lohinger et al . _  ( 2008 ) studied the secular influence of jupiter and saturn on the planetary motion in the hz of a g2v star for various separations of the two giants .",
    "while jupiter was fixed at its actual orbit 5.2  au , saturn s initial semi - major axis was varied between 8.0 and 11.0  au .",
    "[ fig : jupsat ] gives a global view of the perturbations of various jupiter - saturn configurations on the hz of a sun - type star .",
    "we can clearly see that most of the area in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plot ( semi - major axes for the terrestrial planet and saturn , respectively ) is not perturbed by the two giant planets , but note the arched band showing higher maximum eccentricities for test planets .",
    "this is due to the secular frequency associated with the precession of the perihelion of jupiter .",
    "special attention should be paid to the location of earth s orbit , where strong variations of the eccentricity ( up to @xmath100.6 ) can be observed for semi - major axes of saturn between 8.5 and 8.8  au .",
    "we thus see that the dynamical evolution of giant planets is of utmost relevance for habitability conditions on earth - like planets .",
    "the huge diversity of planetary systems differing significantly from the architecture of our solar system suggests very different evolutionary tracks where processes like planet migration , planet - planet scattering , resonant trapping , mutual collisions or hyperbolic ejections influence the final constitution of a planetary system .",
    "observations reveal large eccentricities for many exoplanets , probably indicating phases of strong interactions .    since all planets in our solar system move in nearly circular orbits",
    ", it appears that its instability phase was moderate , probably enabling the successful formation and evolution of life on earth .",
    "it may then be questionable whether planetary systems harboring a giant planet in an eccentric orbit can provide suitable conditions for habitability at all .    on a further note , recalling that most of the stars in our galaxy are members of binary or multiple star systems , additional gravitational perturbations from the binary interactions",
    "should also be taken into account for the assessment of habitability , as shown in detail by _ eggl et al . _",
    "( 2012 ) , _ kane and hinkel _ ( 2013 ) , _ kaltenegger and haghighipour _ ( 2013 ) , and _ haghighipour and kaltenegger _ ( 2013 ) .    *",
    "3.2 water transport *    where did the essential water on earth in the amount of 0.02 percent then come from ?",
    "simulations show ( e.g. , _",
    "obrien et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) that our terrestrial planets likely formed out of material located in a ring around their present locations , i.e. , they formed in the region of the habitable zone .",
    "however , both meteoritic evidence as well as evolutionary disk models show that the disk in this region was too warm to allow for the presence of sufficient amounts of water in solids .",
    "therefore , water ( ice ) delivery should have happened later ; the sources were unlikely to be comets , because statistically their collision probability with the earth is too low ( _ morbidelli _ , 2013 ) .",
    "current thinking is that the chondritic material from the outer asteroid belt is primarily responsible for the earth s water content .",

    "the simulations , however , very sensitively depend on the initial conditions and the distribution of the planetesimals",
    ". growth of terrestrial planets via collisions ( with bodies from the dry inner regions , and also the water - rich outer regions of the asteroid belt ) is often thought to take place when the disk gas has disappeared and only massive solid bodies remain .",
    "the mutual perturbations between these planetary embryos lead to orbital crossings and collisions ; additionally , giant planets such as jupiter trigger collisions .",
    "the general assumption now is that about @xmath11 of the mass of the earth accreted from beyond 2.5  au , suggesting that the composition of the relevant planetary embryos is close to the composition of carbonaceous chondrites which contain of order 510% of water ( e.g. , _ lunine et al . _ , 2011 ) .    _",

    "jupiter migrated inward when saturn was still accumulating mass ; saturn also started to migrate inward because of scattering of rocky planetesimals out from the inner part of the belt .",
    "the two planets eventually fell into the 2:3 mean motion resonance , with jupiter located at 1.5  au ; meanwhile , the giants had scattered s - type planetesimals outward and confined the inner planetesimal disk to about 1 - 1.5  au .",

    ", 2012 ; _ dvorak et al . _ , 2012 , _ maindl & dvorak _ , 2014 ; _ maindl et al . _ , 2013 ) .    obviously , the scenario for the water delivery to earth is still incomplete and depends highly on the initial conditions one is using .",
    "the conditions on the surface and in the atmospheres of terrestrial planets are controlled by the radiative and particle output of the host star ; as this output varies on time scales of minutes to billions of years , conditions in planetary atmospheres are temporarily or permanently modified .",
    "the photospheric radiative output is a consequence of the nuclear energy production in the star s interior ; it dominates the optical and partly the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) spectrum .",
    "the star s effective temperature and its luminosity follow from the laws of stellar structure and consequent nuclear reactions in the core , which gradually vary in time .    in contrast , radiation in the ultraviolet ( uv , 2100 - 3500   ) , the far - ultraviolet ( fuv , 9122100   ) , the extreme ultraviolet ( euv , 100912   ) , and the x - ray ( @xmath12  100   ) range is a consequence of ( often violent ) energy release in the stellar atmosphere due to annihilation of unstable magnetic fields .",
    "magnetic activity is expressed in cool photospheric spots , chromospheric plage emitting in the ultraviolet , and hot ( million - degree ) coronal plasma in `` magnetic loops '' with strong x - ray radiation ; also , highly - energetic , accelerated particles , shock fronts from mass ejections , short - term energetic flares and perhaps also the solar wind indicate the operation of magnetic energy release .",
    "magnetic fields are ultimately generated in a magnetic dynamo in the stellar interior , driven by the interaction between convection and differential rotation .",
    "the short - wavelength stellar output is therefore a function of stellar rotation ( depending on stellar age ) and of the stellar spectral type ( determining the depth of the convection zone , itself also somewhat dependent on age ) .    a late - type star s rotation period , @xmath13 , steadily declines during its main - sequence life ( see chapter by _ bouvier et al .",
    "_ in this volume ) .",
    "this is consequence of the stellar magnetic field permeating the ionized stellar wind which transports away angular momentum .",
    "the declining rotation period itself feeds back to the dynamo , weakening the production of magnetic activity . as a consequence , @xmath13",

    "a generalized formula has been derived by _ mamajek and hillenbrand _ ( 2008 ) namely @xmath14_0 - 0.495)^{0.325}~t_6^{0.566}~{\\rm [ d]}$ ] where @xmath15_0 $ ] is the intrinsic stellar @xmath16 color and @xmath17 is the stellar age in myr . for younger stars",
    ", the rotation period also depends on the presence of a circumstellar disk ( around pre - main sequence stars ) leading to `` disk - locked '' , relatively slow rotation , and the history of disk dispersal before the arrival on the main sequence ( ms ) , leading to a wide range of zams rotation periods ( _ soderblom et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) .",
    "* 4.1 the evolution of stellar optical radiation *    before arriving on the ms , a star s luminosity first decreases when it moves down the hayashi track as a t tauri star ; in that phase , the sun was several times brighter than today , although its effective temperature was lower ( @xmath18  k ) and its radius consequently larger ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "before reaching the zams , solar - like stars reach a minimum bolometric luminosity , @xmath20 , which for a solar - mass star is as low as @xmath100.45@xmath21 ( at an age of @xmath22  myr ; _ baraffe et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "the sun s bolometric luminosity has steadily increased since its arrival on the zams , starting from @xmath23% of today s luminosity . at the same time , the effective temperature also increased somewhat ( _ sackmann & boothroyd _ , 2003 ) .",
