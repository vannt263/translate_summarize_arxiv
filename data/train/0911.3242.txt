    "conformal field theories ( cft ) in two space - time dimensions have been the object of intensive work since the mid eighties , after the fundamental paper @xcite .",
    "these theories have very diverse and important physical applications , from the description of critical behavior in statistical mechanics and solid state physics in low dimension , to the worldsheet description of string theory .",
    "furthermore , their remarkable analytical and algebraic structures and their connections with many other domains of mathematics make them outstanding laboratories of new techniques and ideas .",
    "a particularly striking feature is the possibility of classifying large classes of cft through the study of representations of the virasoro algebra of conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "the classification of cft partition functions , leading to the ade scheme , follows from exploiting the additional symmetry under modular transformations , the discrete coordinate changes that leave invariant the double - periodic finite - size geometry of the torus .",
    "modular invariance has a precursor in ordinary statistical mechanics of lattice models , like the ising model @xcite .",
    "consider a finite @xmath0 square lattice in two dimensions as in fig.[fig - tm ] : it is common to use the transfer matrix formalism to compute the partition function and other quantities of physical relevance in the model .",
    "each configuration of degrees of freedom on a row of the lattice is associated with a state vector in a hilbert space .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath1 is an operator acting on a state vector and manufacturing the state vector of the next row .",
    "it may thus be regarded as a discrete version of a time evolution operator , for time flowing vertically , see fig .",
    "the partition function of a system with @xmath2 rows and periodic boundary conditions in the time direction is then @xmath3 . now",
    "the model also admits a transfer matrix @xmath4 in the orthogonal direction , ( a column - to - column transfer matrix ) and if periodic boundary conditions are also imposed in that direction , one has an alternative expression of the partition function : @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in the doubly - periodic toroidal geometry there are two ways of writing the partition function .",
    "imposing their equality may give some useful informations on the model , but in general these are too weak to constraint its operator content , spectrum , etc .",
    "in the case of conformal field theories , there are special features that allow for a complete solution of the modular invariance conditions @xcite :    * the spectrum of states in the theory , is organized in families , the `` conformal towers '' , with an infinite dimensional algebra acting as a spectrum generating algebra , ( the virasoro algebra or one of its extensions @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the structure of these conformal towers is given by the representation theory of the `` chiral '' algebra parameterized by the virasoro central charge @xmath6 and other quantum numbers .",
    "* the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the virasoro generator of dilatations @xmath7 and its conjugate @xmath8 , whose eigenvalues give the conformal weights ( scale dimensions ) .",
    "the lowest - energy state in each tower , i.e. in each virasoro representation , is called the `` highest weight vector '' with conformal weight @xmath9 and the excited states are obtained by acting on it with algebra generators .",
    "( note the mismatch of terminology : the highest weight vector is actually the lowest energy state . )",
    "the structure of each tower is encoded in the character of the representation , @xmath10 , which is the generating function of the dimensions of eigenspaces of given energy ( see below eq .",
    "( [ chara ] ) ) . * the partition function @xmath11 can be rewritten in terms of the hamiltonian and thus of the virasoro generators @xmath12 , ( eq . ( [ evol ] )",
    "hereafter ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it involves a sum of bilinears of characters with undetermined non negative integer multiplicities of representations in the theory , see eq .",
    "( [ toruspf ] ) . *",
    "the requirement of modular invariance constrains these multiplicities and allows for the complete classification of partition functions in some theories for which that character expansion of @xmath11 is finite .    in this contribution",
    ", we describe this classification program in the simplest classes of conformal theories , namely the virasoro minimal models , having central charge @xmath13 , and the models with the affine lie algebra @xmath14 as an extended symmetry .",
    "the main result is that the modular invariant partition functions are in one - to - one correspondence with the dynkin diagrams of the a , d and e types @xcite .",
    "each partition function defines an independent theory with specific hilbert space and field content .",
    "two - dimensional conformal field theories are quantum field theories enjoying covariance properties under conformal , _ i.e. _ local scale , transformations @xcite .",
    "it is postulated that such theories exist and are consistent on any two - dimensional riemann surface @xcite . in the case of the plane with complex coordinate @xmath15",
    ", one shows that @xmath15 and its complex conjugate @xmath16 may be treated as independent variables , called holomorphic and anti - holomorphic coordinates .",
    "infinitesimal conformal transformations are generated by two copies of the virasoro algebra @xcite , acting on @xmath15 and @xmath16 and called right and left chiral algebras , respectively .",
    "more generally , one may consider theories with an extended chiral algebra @xmath17 containing virasoro , such as the affine lie ( kac  moody ) algebras @xcite , the superconformal algebras , etc .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath18 of the cft decomposes onto pairs of representations @xmath19 of the left and right copies of the virasoro algebra or of @xmath17 . for `` rational '' conformal field theories ( rcft ) ,",
    "the number of such irreducible representations @xmath19 is finite .",
    "we label by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the left and right irreducible representations , respectively .",
    "these pairs of representations are in one - to - one correspondence with the `` primary conformal fields '' @xmath22 @xcite .    the finite decomposition of the rcft hilbert space can be written : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are non negative integer multiplicities .",
    "these are subjected to consistency constraints , due to the fact that the rcft must exist and be consistent on any riemann surface @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a crucial condition on the torus is the modular invariance of the partition function : this requirement determines the @xmath24 as described hereafter .",
    "we start by considering the theory defined on a cylinder ( see fig.[fig - map ] ) of perimeter @xmath25 with a coordinate @xmath26 ; points of coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 are identified .",
    "this cylinder is equivalent to the plane punctured at the origin , equipped with a complex coordinate @xmath15 , by means of the conformal mapping @xmath28 . on the cylinder ,",
    "it is natural to think of the hamiltonian as the operator of translation along its axis ( the imaginary axis in @xmath26 ) , or more generally along any helix , defined by its complex period @xmath29 in the @xmath26 plane , with @xmath30 : @xmath31 in the particular case of fig.[fig - tm ] , while the general case is depicted in fig . [ fig2b ] .",
    "the virasoro generators of translations in @xmath26 and @xmath32 ( regarded as independent variables ) are identified with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , therefore @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the complex conjugate of @xmath37 .            through the conformal mapping @xmath38 ,",
    "it is clear that these translations correspond to dilatations and rotations in the plane . indeed , using the transformation law of the energy - momentum tensor , one finds @xcite : [ cyltopl ] l_-1^cyl = -2il ( l_0 -c24 )  , where @xmath7 belongs to the virasoro algebra of the plane and the term @xmath39 comes from the conformal anomaly . in the continuum formulation ,",
    "the transfer matrix is the exponential of the hamiltonian , @xmath40 and therefore , the evolution operator on a cylinder of length @xmath41 is given by : [ evol ] ( -h^cyl l ) =  .",
    "we now introduce the partition function of the theory on a torus @xmath42 : this is expressed by the trace of the evolution operator , owing to the identification of the two ends of the cylinder , [ ztorus ] z()=",
    "_  e^2i [ ( l_0-c24 ) -|(|l_0-c24 ) ]  .",
    "each irreducible representation @xmath19 of vir ( or of @xmath17 ) is graded for the action of the virasoro generator @xmath7 : the spectrum of @xmath7 in @xmath19 is of the form @xmath43 , with non - trivial multiplicities @xmath44(subspace of eigenvalue @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is thus natural to introduce a generating function of these multiplicities , i.e. a function of a dummy variable @xmath46 , called the character of the representation @xmath19 : [ chara ] _",
    "j(q)=__j   q^l_0-c24=q^h_j - c24 _",
    "n=0^m_n q^n  .",
    "these functions have been computed for several classes of chiral algebras @xcite .    using ( [ hilbert ] ) and the definition of characters , the trace in ( [ ztorus ] )",
    "may be written as : [ toruspf ] z()=_j  n_j  _ j(q )  _ ( |q )  , q = e^2i  , |q = e^-2i|  .",
    "let s stress that in these expressions , @xmath47 is the complex conjugate of @xmath46 , and therefore , @xmath11 is a sesquilinear form in the characters . equation ( [ toruspf ] ) shows that the torus partition function provides a convenient way of encoding the structure of the rcft hilbert space ( [ hilbert ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the torus @xmath42 has been specified in ( [ toruspf ] ) through the modular parameter @xmath37 , @xmath30 ; the two periods are @xmath48 and @xmath37 , up to a global , irrelevant dilatation by @xmath25 .",
    "equivalently , the torus may be regarded as the quotient of the complex @xmath26-plane by the lattice generated by the two numbers @xmath48 and @xmath37 : [ torus ] = / ( )  , in the sense that points are identified according to @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that there is a redundancy in the description of the torus : the modular parameters @xmath37 and @xmath51 describe the same torus , for any transformation of the modular group : @xmath52 , with @xmath53 defined up to a global sign and satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "the group is generated by the two transformations : @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite : the first one is depicted in fig.[fig - tor ] and the second exchanges the two periods of the torus generalizing the case in fig.[fig - tm ] .    the partition function must be uniquely defined on the torus , independently of coordinate choices , and thus be invariant under modular transformations : z ( - ) = z ( + 1 ) = z ( )  . [ z - inv ] these conditions , together with the expression ( [ toruspf ] ) of @xmath11 as a sesquilinear form in the characters , were introduced by cardy @xcite . as we shall show in the following , they open a route to the classification of rcfts .        in rcfts ,",
    "the finite set of characters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , transforms under modular transformations according to a unitary linear representation .",
    "it suffices to give the action of the two generators of the modular group acting on @xmath37 , hence on @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath2 and @xmath61 are unitary matrices @xcite .",
    "it follows that rcft partition functions ( [ toruspf ] ) are modular invariant if the ( non - negative ) integer multiplicity matrices @xmath62 obey the conditions : sns^=tnt^=n  .",
    "[ n - cond ] when explicit computations of the partition function ( path integral ) are possible , the results should automatically be modular invariant . in case of the strongly - interacting rcfts ,",
    "such derivations are not usually available : one can consider the algebraic construction described here , starting from the representations of the chiral algebra , and impose the modular invariance condition .",
    "let us stress that in this approach , modular invariance of @xmath11 is just one necessary condition for the consistency of the theory : there are additional requirements on other quantities , such as the crossing symmetry of the four - point function on the plane @xcite @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus are led to the following : + * classification problem*. _ for a given chiral algebra , find all possible hilbert spaces ( [ hilbert ] ) , i.e. all possible sesquilinear forms ( [ toruspf ] ) with non negative integer coefficients that are modular invariant , and such that @xmath63 .",
    "_    the label @xmath48 refers to the identity representation ( with @xmath64 ) and the condition @xmath63 expresses the unicity of the ground state . as mentioned above , the finite set of characters of any rcft , labelled by @xmath65 , supports a unitary representation of the modular group .",
    "this implies that the diagonal combination of characters , @xmath66 , is always modular invariant for any rcft .",
    "finding the general solutions for @xmath11 in any rcft is a well posed , although involved , algebraic problem .",
