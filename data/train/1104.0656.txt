    "this conditions can be easily attained in a typical nmr experiment . considering a hydrogen nuclei at @xmath298 t ( @xmath299 mhz ) and @xmath300 s , we obtain , together with condition ( [ 33 ] ) , the following range for the magnitude of the control field @xmath296 for the protocol to work , i.e. , @xmath301 : @xmath302    note that the nmr setup is appropriate for this kind of experiment due to the fact that the relaxation time is relatively large compared with other platforms .",

    "we verified that only @xmath1 is affected by the time - dependency of the system frequency and built the kraus and the phenomenological operators for the spin-@xmath0 system under both the amplitude- and the phase - damping channels assumed within the master equation approach .",

    "@xcite , translated here for the spin-@xmath0 system is different from the dynamical decoupling methods presented in literature @xcite , where one must interfere in the system in time scales less than the bath correlation time .",
    "the frequency modulation technique takes advantage of the pre existing natural frequency of the system , adding to it a small amplitude to achieve such time scales .",
    "we also discussed the implementation of this protocol to control the longitudinal relaxation time in the nmr context .",
    "it is worth stressing that the development present here applies for markovian environments and adiabatic modulation of the required time - dependent frequency .",
    "therefore , an extension of the present development for non - markovian environments as well as for interacting time - dependent systems would be desirable , since non - markovian environments is present in many promising platforms for quantum information processing such as photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "moreover , time - dependent interacting system would considerably enlarge the perspective of the present work for quantum information purposes .",
    "although the entanglement is not usually present in the nmr system nmrentang , there exists classical and quantum correlations that could be useful for some quantum information protocols @xcite . the decoherence control exposed here",
    "can then be directly applied to protect these correlations from the action of the amplitude - damping channel .",
    "finally , we stress that the theory presented here is completely general and can be applied to different platforms for quantum information processing such as cavity quantum electrodynamics , trapped ions , quantum dots , etc .",
    "however , for this statement to be valid we must assume that all the rotations needed to implement quantum information processing occur at the beginning or at the end of the experiment ; in between them , the system evolves only under the action of the environments .",

    "<S> we present a derivation of the redfield formalism for treating the dissipative dynamics of a time - dependent quantum system coupled to a classical environment . </S>",
    "<S> we compare such a formalism with the master equation approach where the environments are treated quantum mechanically . focusing on a time - dependent spin-@xmath0 system </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the equivalence between both approaches by showing that they lead to the same bloch equations and , as a consequence , to the same characteristic times @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( associated with the longitudinal and transverse relaxations , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristic times are shown to be related to the operator - sum representation and the equivalent phenomenological - operator approach . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a protocol to circumvent the decoherence processes due to the loss of energy ( and thus , associated with @xmath1 ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we simply associate the time - dependence of the quantum system to an easily achieved modulated frequency . </S>",
    "<S> a possible implementation of the protocol is also proposed in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance . </S>"
