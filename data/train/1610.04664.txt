    "this paper deals with the numerical approximation of an acoustic dissipative fluid system .",
    "this kind of problem has attracted much interest , since it is frequently encountered in engineering applications ( @xcite ) .",
    "one typical example is to achieve optimal designs that reduce noise and vibrations in fluid - structure systems like cars , aircraft or dams .",
    "although dissipation is usually neglected in standard acoustics , modeling this phenomenon is essential to study the effect of noise reduction techniques . indeed , in most real situations , damping mechanisms that transform mechanical energy into heat",
    "sometimes these mechanisms are based on surface damping arising from viscoelastic materials placed on the boundary of the propagation domain . in these cases , the dissipative effects are typically included in the model by means of a surface impedance in the boundary conditions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper addresses damping when it arises in the propagation media itself due to friction and heat conduction .",
    "a general approach to this topic can be found in the books by landau and lifshitz @xcite , morse @xcite , and pierce @xcite , all of which include extensive bibliographic references on the subject .",
    "this paper focus on computing the ( complex ) vibration frequencies and modes of an acoustic dissipative fluid system within a rigid cavity .",
    "one motivation for considering this problem is that it constitutes a stepping stone towards the more challenging goal of devising numerical approximations for coupled systems involving fluid - structure interaction between viscous fluids and solid structures .",
    "the natural model for the fluid system should be based on the stokes equations for compressible fluids . however , since in real applications the viscosity is typically very small , the resulting problem turns out a singular perturbation of that for an inviscid fluid .",
    "this fact leads to a kind of dilemma , since appropriate finite elements for the stokes equations introduce spurious modes in the limit case of a vanishing viscosity , whereas the finite elements that avoid such spectral pollution fail when applied to the stokes equation .    to circumvent this drawback , we resort to an alternative model based on a curl - free displacement formulation ( see @xcite for the derivation of a similar model in the time domain from basic mechanical laws ) .",
    "let us remark that in principle the fluid displacement does not need to be curl - free .",
    "however , since the viscosity term due to vorticity is typically very small , except perhaps near the walls of the enclosure , it may be neglected in the interior of the enclosure and eventually modeled as a wall impedance on its boundary ( see @xcite for a similar model ) .",
    "the numerical solution of the vibration problem for an inviscid acoustic homogeneous fluid is nowadays a well known subject ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in its turn , as is shown in remark 2.1 of the present paper , the vibration frequencies of a viscous homogeneous irrotational fluid within a rigid cavity can be algebraically computed from those of the analogous inviscid fluid and the corresponding vibration modes coincide . however , this is not the case for a heterogeneous fluid and this is the reason why we choose this as our model problem . in particular , we consider the acoustic vibration problem for a dissipative fluid system that consists of two homogeneous viscous immiscible fluids contained in a rigid cavity .    we begin with a variational formulation of the spectral problem relying only on the fluid displacement , which leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem . for the theoretical analysis , this",
    "is transformed into an equivalent double - size linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "we introduce a convenient functional framework to analyze it and prove that the nonlinear eigenvalue problem is equivalent to the spectral problem for a nonselfadjoint , noncompact bounded operator .",
    "thus , the essential spectrum not necessarily reduces to zero ( as is the case for compact operators ) .",
    "this means that the spectrum may now contain nonzero eigenvalues of infinite - multiplicity , nonzero accumulation points , continuous spectrum , etc .",
    "thus , following @xcite , our first task is to prove that the relevant eigenvalues can be isolated from the essential spectrum , at least for sufficiently small values of the viscosity that are realistic in practice .",
    "then , we propose a conforming discretization based on raviart - thomas finite elements . by appropriately adapting the abstract spectral approximation theory for noncompact operators developed in @xcite",
    ", we establish that the resulting scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and prove error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , the discrete quadratic eigenvalue problem is shown to be equivalent to a well posed generalized eigenvalue problem which can be solved by standard eigensolvers like @xmath0 from matlab , which is based on arnoldi iterations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ main_problem ] , we introduce the spectral problem and the corresponding variational formulation , which leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary unknown to transform the quadratic eigenvalue problem into a linear one .",
    "moreover , we introduce the corresponding solution operator for the spectral problem . in section  [ spec_char ] , we provide a thorough spectral characterization of the solution operator , based on the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "we also consider the limit problem ( i.e. , the case when the viscosity vanishes ) and the relation between the solutions of the dissipative and non - dissipative problems . in section  [ spec_app ] , we introduce a finite element discretization using raviart - thomas elements for both fluids and imposing the continuity of the corresponding normal components on the interface .",
    "we analyze the discrete spectral problem analogously as in the continuous case and introduce the corresponding discrete solution operator .",
    "we use the abstract theory from @xcite to prove the convergence .",
    "we also prove error estimates for our problem by adapting the arguments from @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ numericos ] , we report some numerical tests which allow us to asses the performance of the proposed method .    throughout the paper ,",

    "looking for this kind of solutions leads to the following quadratic eigenvalue problem :    [ problem1 ] find @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that @xmath42    let us remark that in absence of viscosity ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) we are left with the free vibration problem of two inviscid fluids in contact ( whose numerical approximation has not been analyzed either ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath44 of such a problem are negative real numbers ( as will be proved below ) , so that @xmath45 are purely imaginary , namely , @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the so called _ natural vibration frequencies _ , which correspond to periodic in time solutions @xmath48 of the time domain problem .",
