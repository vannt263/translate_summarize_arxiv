    "the source coding problem for correlated sources has been regarded as an important research area in information theory , and various types of coding problems were studied so far ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in particular , our focus in this paper is the lossy coding problem posed by heegard and berger @xcite .    in the problem , there are one encoder and multiple decoders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] ) . in this paper , we only treat the case with two decoders . the encoder send an encoded version of principal source @xmath0 , and decoders reproduce the principal source within prescribed distortion levels by the help of side - information @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .    in this",
    "setting , heegard and berger showed an upper bound on the rate distortion function .",
    "they also showed that the upper bound is tight if the sources are degraded , i.e. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 form a markov chain in this order .",
    "although some researchers investigated variants of heegard and berger",
    "s problem @xcite , there is no conclusive result , i.e. , an upper bound and a lower bound coincide , without the degraded assumption , and whether heegard and berger s upper bound is tight or not for non - degraded cases has been a long - standing open problem .    in order to provide some insight to this problem",
    ", we investigate a special case of heegard and berger s problem in this paper .",
    "specifically , we consider the case such that the correlated sources @xmath3 is a direct product of two components correlated sources @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the components are independent each other ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scenario ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we exclusively consider the case such that each component is degraded , i.e. , either eq .  ( [ eq : matched - degraded ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : unmatched - degraded ] ) is satisfied .",
    "although the problem setting treated in this paper seems too restrictive at first glance , this is not the case .",
    "the rate distortion function of product sources can be strictly smaller than the summation of the component - wise rate distortion functions even though the components are independent each other , an intuitive example of which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "therefore , the rate distortion function of product sources is not trivial , and it is interesting to characterize the rate distortion function .    when eq .",
    "( [ eq : matched - degraded ] ) is satisfied , the joint sources @xmath3 are degraded .",
    "thus , heegard and berger s result suggests that their upper bound is tight . on the otherhand ,",
    "when eq .",
    "( [ eq : unmatched - degraded ] ) is satisfied , the joint sources are not degraded .",
    "thus , whether heegard and berger s upper bound is tight or not is unclear so far . in this paper , we show that the upper bound is tight , i.e. , we characterize the rate - distortion function . as long as the author s knowledge",
    ", this is the first example such that the rate - distortion function is characterized without the degraded assumption .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we explain the problem setting treated in this paper , and also explain known results . in section [ sec : main ] , we show our main result and its proof . in section [ sec : gaussian ] , we show the gaussian example .        ) for the product source is strictly smaller than the summation of the component - wise rate distortion functions . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent uniform binary random variables , and @xmath8 represent a constant random variable .",
    "when two components are encoded and decoded separately , @xmath9 bit must be sent for each components , which means @xmath10 bits must be sent to reproduce @xmath11 at both decoders . on the otherhand ,",
    "if the encoder sends @xmath12 , then both decoders can reproduce @xmath11 as in the network coding @xcite .",
    "thus , when the components are encoded and decoded jointly , @xmath9 bit suffice for the decoders to reproduce @xmath11 .",
    "this example can be also regarded as a special case of the complementary delivery network @xcite , and the relation between the complementary delivery network and the network coding was pointed out in @xcite . ]",
    "in this section , we explain the problem formulation treated in this paper , which is a special case of the problem formulation treated by heegard and berger in @xcite .",
