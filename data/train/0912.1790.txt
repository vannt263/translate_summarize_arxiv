    "the concept of error correction in linear network coding was introduced by cai and yeung in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scenario considered there is known as coherent network coding meaning that the network topology as well as the linear network code are assumed to be known both to the sender and to the receivers .",
    "noncoherent network coding was considered by ktter and kschischang in  @xcite for the first time . here , neither the sender nor the receivers are assumed to know the topology or the linear network code . to mimic the communication situation ktter and",
    "kschischang coined the concept of an operator channel which takes as input and output subsets of some fixed ambient vector space @xmath0 .",
    "the set of vector subspaces is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the game of error correction now is to identify the set of messages with a collection of subspaces @xmath2 called a subspace code . if @xmath3 has been chosen cleverly it will , under certain assumptions , be possible to recover the message at the receiving end by performing some decoding algorithm . as part of their description they introduced the subspace distance in @xmath1 . using this distance",
    "then a minimum distance of @xmath3 is obtained .",
    "let @xmath4 be the number of errors and @xmath5 be the number of erasures occurred during the transmission over the channel ( we will not formally define here what these concepts mean ) .",
    "the original message can be recovered if @xmath6 is less than the minimum distance of the subspace code under consideration .",
    "however , the converse does not necessarily hold .",
    "ktter and kschischang adapted the rank - metric code construction by gabidulin to work in the above setting and gave an efficient decoding algorithm for them .",
    "they presented a singleton bound and demonstrated that the adapted gabidulin codes attain it asymptotically .    in  @xcite silva and",
    "kschischang considered a slightly different model of non - coherent network coding . in particular",
    "they coined a new distance , namely the injection distance .",
    "their interpretation of the number @xmath4 of errors and the number @xmath5 of erasures also differs from the one in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the model in  @xcite is that it allows not only a sufficient , but also a necessary condition for decoding to be possible .",
    "we now describe the model in detail . as above each message",
    "is identified with a codeword in @xmath2 .",
    "the sender injects a possibly overcomplete basis for this subspace into the network .",
    "the nodes then forward a linear combination of the incoming vectors on each outgoing edge and possibly add an error vector .",
    "let @xmath7 be an @xmath8 matrix which rows are the source packets and for a specific receiver denote by @xmath9 the @xmath10 matrix which rows are the received packets .",
    "let the number of error vectors be @xmath4 and denote by @xmath11 the @xmath12 matrix which rows are the errors .",
    "with respect to the specific receiver let @xmath13 be the @xmath14 transfer matrix for the linear code ( the error free part ) and let @xmath15 be the @xmath16 transfer matrix for the errors .",
    "this gives us the model @xmath17 the transfer matrices @xmath13 and @xmath15 are unknown to the receiver and are chosen by the adversary while respecting the constraint @xmath18 .",
    "here , @xmath5 is a parameter called the rank deficiency of @xmath13 , known to all the participants .",
    "+ knowing @xmath9 the decoding rule to use is @xmath19 where @xmath20 here , the last equality corresponds to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 16 ) .",
    "the ability of a subspace code @xmath3 to support the above decoding algorithm is described by the following parameter .",
    "the injection distance between spaces @xmath21 is defined as follows @xmath22 this in an obvious way translates into a minimum distance @xmath23 for any subspace code @xmath24 .",
    "assume there is a bijective map between the set of messages and the subspace code @xmath3 .",
    "the code is guaranteed to correct @xmath4 packet errors , under rank deficiency @xmath5 , if and only if @xmath25 .",
    "the injection distance relates to the subspace distance @xmath26 from  @xcite as follows @xmath27 hence , except for a factor @xmath28 the two distances are the same if @xmath29 .",
    "a subspace code @xmath3 is called equidimensional if all of its codewords have the same fixed dimension .",
    "it is clear that except for a factor @xmath28 the minimum distance of an equidimensional subspace code is the same no matter which of the metrics @xmath30 or @xmath26 is used .",
    "a subspace code @xmath31 with @xmath0 an @xmath32-dimensional vector space over @xmath33 ( the finite field with @xmath34 elements ) , with size @xmath35 , maximum dimension of a codeword @xmath36 and minimum injection distance @xmath37 is said to be of type [ @xmath38 .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is called the rate of the code ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 ) ) .",
    "this parameter clearly serves as a measure of the efficiency of communication in a model where every block of information consists of @xmath40 vectors of size @xmath32 that are injected into the system . in other words , in a situation where we inject a possible overcomplete basis of @xmath40 vectors into the system , the dimension of the codeword is unimportant . following the ideas of  @xcite we will give a singleton type upper bound on @xmath41 in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath32 .",
