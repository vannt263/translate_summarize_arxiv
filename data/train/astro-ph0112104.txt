    "with the growing awareness that the bulge globular clusters are a distinct subsystem has come a new urgency to determine their ages and chemical composition . to explore possible connections between clusters and the field , it is most interesting to compare the detailed compositions of these clusters with the galactic bulge field population ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) . as simple stellar populations",

    "we employed the standard nirspec-5 setting , which uses the h - band filter and covers most of the 1.5 - 1.8 micron band with only small inter - order gaps .",
    "the night of 26 july 2000 was photometric , but the dome rotation failed , permitting observations only of objects crossing through the dome slit , which fortunately lay nearly due south .",
    "we exposed for @xmath10 min in liller  1 , and @xmath11 min in ngc  6553 .",
    "it must be assumed that a portion of the exposures were compromised by some occultation of the pupil by the dome . considering that little time was available , it was fortunate that 2 bright giants in each cluster fell on the slit ( without requiring image rotation ) .",
    "the @xmath12 long slit was long enough to permit nodding between exposures .",
    "the h band images of the slit are given in fig .  1 ;",
    "these were obtained using the slit viewing camera ( scam ) of nirspec , which is equipped with a picnic 256@xmath13256 hgcdte array detector and has a field of view of 46@xmath646and a scale of @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "the raw frames were background subtracted and flat fielded . each order of the echellogram has been then extracted and straightened according to its tilt angle .",
    "the normalized one - dimensional spectra have been obtained summing over the 3 brightest rows and dividing by the continuum , which was determined applying a low - pass smoothing filter through each spectrum .",
    "imperfect subtraction of some of the brightest oh night sky lines leaves some apparently high continuum points .",

    "the reduced echelle spectra of the observed stars in liller  1 and ngc  6553 , covering the 1.51 - 1.75 @xmath18 m wavelength range , are shown in figs .  2 and 3 , respectively .",

    "the atomic oscillator strengths and the excitation potentials have been taken from kurucz s database .",
    "for the ca lines around 1.615 @xmath19 we used the values tabulated by bimont & grevesse ( 1973 , hereafter bg73 ) which provide a more reasonable synthesis of the observed spectra ( cf .",

    "the reference solar abundances have been updated according to grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) .    by using the co ( @xmath20 ) and oh ( @xmath21 ) molecular lines in the 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath18 m spectral window we can infer reliable carbon and oxygen abundances ( cf . e.g. lambert et al .",
    "these lines are not heavily saturated even in the high metallicity domain and still lie on the linear part of the element curve of growth , where the line equivalent width variation with the abundance is maximum .",
    "we can also infer an estimate of the nitrogen abundance using the cn ( @xmath22 molecular lines ( cf .",
    "e.g. sneden & lambert 1982 ) .    at the nirspec resolution of r=25,000 we can measure several single rotaion - vibration oh lines .",
    "however , our carbon abundances are mostly derived from co bandheads ; in contrast to oh , the co lines are more blended at our resolution .",
    "other metal abundances can be derived from the atomic lines of fe  i , mg  i , si  i and ca  i , altough heavily saturated and somewhat less sensitive to the element abundance variation compared to the molecular lines , being on the damping part of the curve of growth , where the equivalent width increases much more slowly with the element abundance .",
    "the modeling of the main molecular and atomic lines for cool stars in the h band is relatively straightforward .",
    "the major source of continuum opacity is h@xmath23 and it has its minimum near 1.6 @xmath18 m . these two facts also minimize any dependence of the results on the choice of model atmosphere .",
    "the molecular lines are due to rotation - vibration transitions in the ground electronic state , so they can be safely treated under the lte approximation . at these low temperatures ,",
    "the metals are mostly neutral or singly ionized , eliminating the need to compute equlibria for higher stages of ionization .",
    "the atomic oscillator strengths remain the major source of uncertainty , and their computed values could require a detailed cross - calibration with suitable stellar template spectra . in sect .",
    "3.1 we discuss in some more detail how diferrent assumptions for the oscillator strength values can affect the line profiles and the derived element abundances .    from the near infrared ( ir ) photometry of liller  1 and ngc  6553 published by frogel , kuchinski & tiede ( 1995 ) and guarnieri et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , their e(j  k ) reddening of 1.70 and 0.41 and the corresponding a@xmath24=0.87 and 0.24 corrections , and their distance moduli of @xmath25=14.7 and 13.6 , respectively , we compute the ( j  k)@xmath26 colors and the absolute k magnitudes for the observed stars ( cf . table  1 ) .",
    "we use the color - temperature transformation and the bolometric corrections of montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) specifically calibrated on globular cluster giants , to derive the stellar temperature and bolometric magnitudes of the observed stars from the ( j  k)@xmath26 color ( cf . table  1 ) .",
    "the two giants in liller  1 are the brightest in the cluster and we infer t@xmath273700 and 3900  k , while those in ngc  6553 have t@xmath273900 and 4000  k. the expected uncertainty in the temperature estimate is @xmath28200  k , taking into account the possible systematic effects due to the reddening correction and the color - temperature transformation . concerning the stellar gravity , according to the theoretical evolutionary tracks , in the high metallicity domain the expected values for the stars in the upper part of red giant branch are log  g@xmath281.0 , depending on their actual luminosity and temperature ( see origlia et al . 1997 and references therein for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "both the photometric quantitites reported in table  1 and the similarity of the infrared spectra ( cf . figs .  2 and 3 ) indicate that the two observed stars in each clusters should have very similar photospheric parameters .",
    "hence , as a first step in our analysis of the spectra , we adopt ( cf .",
    "table  2 ) average temperature and gravity of t@xmath29=3800  k and log  g=0.5 for the 2 giants of liller  1 and t@xmath29=4000  k and log  g=1.0 for those in ngc  6553 .",
    "we also adopt the microturbulence of @xmath30 according to the values inferred by origlia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the co bandheads in the integrated spectra of these clusters . in sec .",
    "3.1 , we will consider how our derived abundances depend on these parameters .",
    "for both clusters the best fits to the observed spectra using the above reference stellar parameters have been obtained for half solar [ fe / h ] , solar [ o / fe ] and a similar enhancement by a factor of @xmath312 for the other @xmath32 elements ( si , mg , ca ) ( cf . table  2 ) .",
    "we also find some @xmath33c depletion and @xmath34n enhancement ( by a factor of @xmath172 , as well ) , as expected from the first dredge - up mixing process in the stellar interior during the evolution on the red giant branch ( cf .",
    "e.g. boothroyd & sackmann 1999 for a recent review ) .",
    "the fit also gives the [ @xmath33c/@xmath35c]@xmath285 ratio .",
    "such a low value can not be explained by first dredge - up alone and requires some extra - mixing processes occurring during the last ascent of the red giant branch ( boothroyd & sackmann 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "an overall , conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the derived absolute abundances is @xmath280.2  dex .",
    "our synthetic best fits superimposed on the observed spectra of liller  1 and ngc  6553 in three major spectral regions of interest , are plotted in figs .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "these synthtetic spectra well account for most of the observed features , and the few major discrepancies should be mainly ascribed to a bad oh sky line and/or atmospheric feature subtraction .",
    "in such a high metallicity domain , it is almost impossible to find lines which are completely unblended , even at high resolution",
    ". nevertheless , we identified a few representative metal and oh lines which are reasonably clean to provide useful equivalent width measurements . by integrating over a @xmath361    range from the line central wavelength we obtain values systematically larger ( 30@xmath3610% ) than those from a simple gaussian fit of the line using the instrumental 0.8    fwhm , possibly indicating that some blend effects are at work . for this reason we decided to use the values from the gaussian fit with an overall accuracy of @xmath3630  m .",
    "these values are reported in table  1 .",
    "the inferred heliocentric radial velocities ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) for the stars in liller  1 ( 66 and 61  km  s@xmath9 ) are consistent with the value listed by harris ( 1996 ) ( 52@xmath3615  km  s@xmath9 ) . in the case of ngc  6553 our velocities (",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are well within the relative wide range of values ( between -60 and + 60 km  s@xmath9 ) published in the literature ( cf .",
    "e.g. table 3 of coelho et al .",
    "2001 for a summary ) .      in order to investigate the influence of slightly different assumptions for the stellar parameters on the inferred abundances we also compute synthetic spectra with @xmath39a=@xmath360.2  dex ( where a is the input element abundance for the computation of the line opacities and the variation refers to all elements ) , @xmath39t@xmath29@xmath40200  k , @xmath39log  g=@xmath360.5  dex and @xmath41@xmath400.5  km  s@xmath9 with respect to the adopted reference parameters ( cf .",
    "table  2 ) .",
    "the adopted ranges for the stellar parameters are quite conservative and somewhat representative of their maximum uncertainty .",
    "we analyze both the line profiles and the equivalent widths .",
    "the resulting stellar spectra of the two clusters , centered on a few selected atomic and molecular lines of interest are plotted in figs .",
    "6 and 7 , while their measured equivalent widths are compared in figs .  8 and 9 ,",
    "respectively .",
    "a variation of @xmath360.2  dex in the element abundance affects only slightly the depth and the broadening of the atomic line profiles , but strongly affects the more metal sensitive co and oh lines .",
    "the change in the line strength due to a @xmath360.2  dex abundance variation can be equally obtained by varying some other atmospheric parameters , but by quite a large amount .",
    "for example , @xmath42 variation in the microturbulent velocity , and also temperature variation of @xmath16200  k in the case of the ca and si lines , could have a similar effect , but larger ( smaller ) microturbolent velocities and/or lower ( higher ) temperatures are required to fit lower ( higher ) input abundances , somewhat contrary to the stellar evolution prescriptions for population ii stars ( cf .",
    "e.g. straniero & chieffi 1991 , schaller et al .",
    "1992 , bertelli et al .",
    "1994 , cassisi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the molecular bands behave in a similar fashion : the major change in the line strength due to a @xmath360.2  dex abundance variation , could also be the result of relatively large ( @xmath360.5  dex ) log  g variation in the case of the co band heads , while for the oh lines , somewhat more saturated , are mainly major temperature and microturbulent velocity variations which affect the line profiles . again , as in the case of the atomic lines , a decrease in the input abundance has to be compensated for by lowering the stellar gravity and temperature or increasing the microturbulence velocity ( viceversa for an increase of the input abundance ) .",
    "these trends are in the opposite direction of the standard evolution prescriptions along the red giant branch .",
    "line equivalent widths are only marginal affected ( within the @xmath3630  m  scatter ) by the variation of the stellar parameters in the ranges mentioned above , the major scatter ( @xmath43 ) with the element abundance . in the case of the oh bands and the si line ( slightly blended with oh as well ) , a 200k increase in effective temperature with respect to the adopted reference gives model equivalent widths which are ( @xmath44 ) lower than the observed widths .",
    "although one might be concerned that the photometric estimate of the effective temperature can be quite uncertain ( mainly due to reddening correction ) , the molecular lines are expecially powerful in constraining its value .",
    "the scatter between the abundances inferred from different molecular lines ( cf .",
    "e.g. the case of the two selected oh lines ) is even smaller than the adopted @xmath45 dex error , indicating that in presence of high signal to noise spectra the carbon and oxygen abundances can be constrained down to a limit of @xmath46 dex .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the stellar features under consideration show a similar trend with variations in the stellar parameters , altough with different sensitivities . as a consequence of such a behavior , _",
    "relative _ abundances are less dependent on stellar parameter variations .",
    "moreover , the simultaneous fit of the different atomic and molecular bands in particular , requires more unique solutions for the adopted stellar parameters , significantly reducing their initial range of variation and ensuring a good self - consistency of the overall spectral synthesis procedure .",
    "on the basis of this analysis , we can conclude that minor stellar parameter variations in the proximity of their best fit solutions do not significantly affect ( within @xmath170.1 dex ) the inferred abundances , and certainly do not affect the relative abundances .    as mentioned in sect .  3",
    ", the adopted oscillator strength is an additional source of uncertainty in the abundances derived from the analysis of the atomic lines . in this respect ,",
    "for some representative bright atomic lines in the h band we compared the results obtained using the oscillator strengths of the kurucz s list with those empirically calibrated by melndez & barbuy ( 1999 , hereafter mb99 ) . on average ,",
    "mb99 values are systematically lower but when the difference does not exceed 0.2  dex ( which is the case for most of the atomic lines under consideration ) , both the line profiles and equivalent widths are only marginally affected and the overall scatter in the derived abundances is @xmath47  dex .    as an example , the atomic parameters and the inferred equivalent widths of the ca , fe , si and mg lines shown in figs . 6 , 7 and 8 ( see also table  1 ) , adopting the kurucz / bg73 or the mb99 oscillator strengths , respectively , for the two best fit models ( cf . table  2 ) to the observed spectra of liller  1 and ngc  6553 are listed in table  3 for comparison .",
    "the difference between the measured equivalent widths is generally @xmath48  m ) with a small impact on the inferred element abundance ( @xmath280.1  dex using the ca  @xmath491.61508 , fe  @xmath491.61532 and si  @xmath491.58884 lines , and @xmath280.2  dex using the fe  @xmath491.55317 and mg  @xmath491.57658 lines ) . for the ca@xmath50 line ,",
    "if the larger oscillator strength by kurucz ( log  gf = 0.362 ) is used , we must assume a significantly lower ( @xmath510.5 dex ) ca abundance and an unlikely [ ca / fe]@xmath520.2  dex underabundance .",
    "the red giant branch slope derived from optical ( ortolani , bica & barbuy 1996 ) and near  ir ( frogel , kuchinski & tiede 1995 ) color magnitude diagrams of liller  1 suggest a supra - solar metallicity , altough these estimates rely on extrapolation of empirical relations calibrated on less metal rich clusters .",
    "integrated spectroscopy based on the calcium triplet ( armandroff & zinn 1988 ) also suggests twice the solar metallicity .",
    "more recently , color - magnitude diagrams from near - infrared photometry ( davidge 2000 ) , and integrated spectroscopy of the co feature around 1.6 @xmath18 m ( origlia et al .",
    "1997 ) are both consistent with half solar metallicity .",
    "our present near ir high resolution spectra of the two single giants confirm such a sub - solar value .",
    "davidge ( 2000 ) also finds that stars in liller  1 are not as metal rich as those in the sorrounding bulge .",
    "frogel , kuchinski & tiede ( 1995 ) also noticed that the stars in the sorrounding field of liller  1 are redder than the most likely cluster members but since they were not able to solve the ambiguity between possible abundance or redenning variations , they did not use this external field to decontaminate the cluster color - magnitude diagram .",
    "ortolani , bica & barbuy ( 1996 ) do not perform a detailed field decontamination of their optical color - magnitude diagrams , however they suggest that the cluster stars can be as metal rich as the bulge population given the locus and curvature of the red giant branch .",

    "note that our finding of solar oxygen abundance from the oh lines should be indeed rather firmly settled within @xmath360.1 dex ( cf .",
    "the discrepancy in the inferred abundances among these different data sets seem most likely due to systematic abundance analysis effects rather than being related to the evolutionary stage of the observed stars ( cf .",

    "nonetheless , the need for more studies of bulge globular clusters is clear , and the use of both optical and infrared spectroscopy could help to settle some of the discrepant abundance determinations ( e.g. combining cno abundances from the infrared with optical measurements of other elements ) .",
    "using the nirspec spectrograph at keck  ii , we have obtained h - band echelle spectra at @xmath59 of two of the brightest giants in each of the galactic bulge globular clusters ngc",

    "we find [ fe / h]=@xmath60 and [ o / h]=@xmath61 for the giants in both clusters .",
    "we measure strong lines for the @xmath58 elements mg , ca , and si , but the lower sensitivity of these lines to abundance permits us to only state a general @xmath3=+0.3\\pm0.2 $ ] dex .",
    "the oxygen abundance is based on many lines in the oh spectrum , rather than on the single forbidden line at 6300  , or the 9 ev triplet at 7774 .",
    "ours is the first use of the oh lines to measure [ o / h ] in old , metal rich stellar populations .",
    "our finding that oxygen is enhanced relative to iron is consistent with massive star supernovae being responsible for the enrichment , and it is noteworthy that alpha enhancements are securely determined in old stars with a high iron abundance of [ fe / h]=@xmath62 .",
    "our abundances for these two ancient globular clusters strengthens further the link between the bulge globular clusters and the bulge field population , pointing toward early formation and rapid enrichment for both clusters and field .",
