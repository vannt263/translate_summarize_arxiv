    "cp violation ( cpv ) as a fundamental property of nature was first established in the system of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , with the measurement @xmath3 ( with a @xmath4 uncertainty ) performed in 1964 at the brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite . since then",
    ", @xmath0 has played a key role in establishing the ckm picture of flavour and cp violation , and in determining the related standard model ( sm ) parameters with precision .",
    "today , the experimental determination of @xmath0 has reached the precision of half a percent , while the theoretical one is still well above the 10% level .",
    "the achievement of a better control of the latter is strongly desirable . indeed , among all observables",
    ", @xmath0 probes new physics ( np ) at some of the highest energy scales .",
    "this holds for both the case in which the np flavour structure is generic ( _ i.e. _ all flavour and cp violating operators are allowed , with coefficients of order one ) , and the case in which it is `` ckm - like '' ( _ i.e. _ only the operators that are also present in the sm are allowed , and each of them with the same parametrical suppression as in the sm ) , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for the updated utfit  @xcite results .",
    "if one goes beyond those effective field theory considerations , still @xmath0 puts some of the most severe constraints on explicit np models , for recent studies see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for supersymmetry and ref .",
    "@xcite for composite higgs models .",
    "thus , in the present situation where no clear evidence for np has emerged in flavour and cp violating observables , @xmath0 could possibly hide deviations at the level of its current precision . if , conversely , a deviation from the sm would first show up in other observables ( as the present data of @xmath5 meson decays seem to suggest @xcite ) , then the level of consistency of these deviations with the properties of @xmath6 meson decays would be important to understand their np origin .",
    "that said , what are the present limiting factors of the @xmath0 sensitivity to np ?",
    "the first one consists in the relatively poor knowledge of some ckm parameters , most notably @xmath7 ( or equivalently @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the cabibbo angle ) and @xmath10 .",
    "this knowledge is expected to be improved substantially by upcoming measurements at belle ii and lhcb @xcite that , hopefully , will also help solving the current tension between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the largest non - parametric contribution to the @xmath0 theoretical uncertainty comes from the computation of the qcd corrections to the box diagram with two charm quarks , @xmath13 . the convergence of its perturbation series , 1 ( lo ) , 1.38 ( nlo ) , 1.87 ( nnlo ) is worrisome , the nnlo contribution being larger than the nlo one .",
    "besides computing the nnlo part , ref .",
    "@xcite has taken into account this apparently bad convergence by associating a `` large '' error to the central value of 1.87 , @xmath14 .",
    "the qcd perturbative corrections to the analogous box diagrams which involve at least a top quark , @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite , appear instead to be better behaved .",
    "the bad convergence properties of the @xmath13 perturbative series have induced different groups to treat it in a different way . indeed , while ckmfitter  @xcite uses @xmath13 as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , utfit  @xcite sticks to its nlo calculation .",
    "this contributes to the visibly different @xmath0 regions in the plots of the two collaborations , and somehow underlines the need to improve in that respect .    how then to make progress on the @xmath0 sm prediction ?",

    "this is achieved by employing the freedom to rephase the kaon fields , and it removes @xmath13 from the theoretical prediction of @xmath0 . while physics should of course not depend on the phase convention chosen for the fields , some dependence remains numerically in this case due to the different techniques employed to compute different `` pieces '' entering the @xmath0 prediction , namely the calculation of @xmath21 ( consisting of a short- and a long- distance `` piece '' ) and that of the decay mixing amplitude @xmath22 ( long - distance ) .",
