    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that the same scattering matrix can be obtained using lagrangians related by transformations of interpolating fields .",
    "transformations of this kind were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "this independence of the s - matrix on the choice of interpolating fields is called the equivalence theorem . at the root of the equivalence theorem",
    "lies the fact that the s - matrix in quantum field theory is defined in terms of free fields whose properties are not changed by the allowed transformations @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the equivalence theorem to hadronic physics has been reemphasised recently .",
    "utilising lagrangian models for pion - nucleon scattering @xcite , compton scattering on the pion @xcite , pion - pion and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung @xcite , nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite and 3-body scattering @xcite , it has been demonstrated that various field transformations relate lagrangians which describe completely different off - shell 3- , 4- and higher - point vertices while leading to identical on - shell scattering amplitudes .",
    "typically , these studies involved only tree - level or one - loop calculations and dealt with local lagrangians and field transformations . to our knowledge there have been no multi - loop calculations illustrating the equivalence theorem . yet , many recent dynamical models describing pion - nucleon @xcite and photon - nucleon @xcite interactions are based on summations of infinite series of loop diagrams .",
    "this is usually done by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite or one of its modifications ( such as 3-dimensional reductions thereof ) with the kernel consisting of a sum of tree - level diagrams .",
    "it is natural to extend the work of @xcite to such multi - loop approaches and to examine the validity of the equivalence theorem for solutions of the bse .",
    "this is the main objective of the present letter . due to the complexity of the equation",
    "a general study is very difficult , therefore we analyse the problem using an example of scattering of two neutral and spinless particles ( represented by scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the relative simplicity of this model helps clarify the essential issues of the problem while avoiding many of the technical complications of more realistic approaches .",
    "we consider two representations of the model lagrangian which are related through a field transformation .",
    "first , we show that the equivalence theorem is satisfied at tree level even though the lagrangian and the field transformation involve form factors , thereby extending conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite to such non - local @xcite lagrangians and transformations .",
    "next , we solve the bse for @xmath2 scattering in the two representations . following the usual practice",
    ", we construct the kernel of the equation as the sum of the tree - level diagrams .",
    "we find that the on - shell scattering amplitudes calculated in the two representations are not equal to each other , indicating that the equivalence theorem is not obeyed by the solution of the bse .",
    "we argue that the principal origin of this representation - dependence is the well - known fact that certain classes of loop graphs are not generated by the bse with a tree - level kernel .",
    "these loop graphs should , however , be included in the full amplitude for which the equivalence theorem is presumed to hold .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two species of spinless neutral particles , described by scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 whose masses are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and assume that a @xmath1 couples to two @xmath0 s with a strength @xmath5 .",
    "we take the masses close to the nucleon and pion masses , @xmath6 mev , @xmath7 mev , and the coupling constant close to the pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction is equipped with a form factor , as is done usually in dynamical models of hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "the model lagrangian reads = 1 2 ( ) ^2 - ^2 + 1 2 ( ) ^2 - m^2 2 ^2 + g 2 , where @xmath9 .",
    "a function of @xmath10 can be viewed as a formal series in powers of @xmath10 .",
    "it corresponds to a form factor in momentum space .",
    "the 3-point @xmath11 vertex extracted from lagrangian has the form h(q^2 ) , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the 4-momenta of the @xmath1 , the first and the second @xmath0 s , respectively .",
    "the vertex function defines the structure of the theory in the first representation , which we will call representation ( i ) .",
    "representation ( ii ) is introduced through a transformation of the @xmath0 field .",
    "similar to lagrangian , we include a form factor @xmath15 in the transformation , + f , , where @xmath16 is a parameter .",

    "the resulting equation obeys two - body @xmath2 unitarity and is often referred to as simply  the bethe - salpeter equation \" ( as opposed to the full bethe - salpeter equation ) .",
    "we will also adhere to this terminology .",
    "the tree - level amplitude equals the potential in which the  physical \" masses and coupling constant are used . in representation",
    "( i ) it is given by the sum of s- and u - channel diagrams , @xmath37 , where , using , t^(i)_,s(q,p;q , p)= h(q^2 ) h(q^2 ) , and @xmath38 can be written by applying the crossing transformation q -q p -p ( s u ) to @xmath39 .",
    "in addition to s- and u - channel diagrams , the tree amplitude in representation ( ii ) contains a contact term , @xmath40 , where , using eqs .  ( [ eq : vert3_rep2 ] ) and ( [ eq : vert4_rep2 ] ) , t^(ii)_,s(q,p;q , p ) & = & \\ { f ( p^2+s-2 m^2 ) f(q^2 ) + h(q^2 ) } + & & \\ { f ( s + p^2 - 2 m^2 ) f(q^2 ) + h(q^2 ) } , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is given by .",
    "the tree amplitudes in both representations are crossing symmetric , i.e.  invariant under the transformation .",
    "this is because they comprise _ all _ diagrams dictated by the corresponding lagrangians at lowest order , see .",

    "p ) = t^(ii)_(q,p;q , p ) q^2=q^2=m^2 , p^2 = p^2=m^2 , thus explicitly demonstrating that the equivalence theorem is obeyed at tree level .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation iterates the tree - level potential @xmath34 to all orders . as a result , in the s - channel pole diagram the @xmath0 propagator and",
    "the @xmath43 vertices become dressed whereas the non - pole u - channel and contact diagrams are not affected @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the s - channel diagram of the potential @xmath34 we use a bare mass @xmath44 in the @xmath0 propagator and a bare coupling constant @xmath45 in the 3-point @xmath11 vertices , and the physical ( renormalised ) quantities @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the u - channel and contact diagrams @xcite .",
    "thus , the off - shell potential in each representation has the form v(q,p;q , p ) = v(q,p;q , p ) + ^(0)(p,p+q,q ) ^(0)(p+q , p , q ) s - m_0 ^ 2 , where @xmath46 is the u - channel diagram ( or is the sum of the u - channel and the contact diagrams for the case of representation ( ii ) ) and the structure of the s - channel pole diagram is shown explicitly .",
    "the bare @xmath43 vertex @xmath47 is given by eqs .",

    "the dressed @xmath43 vertex @xmath49 and the @xmath0 self - energy @xmath50 can be written in terms of @xmath48 , ( p,p , q ) = ^(0 ) ( p,p , q ) & + d^4 k & ^(0 ) ( p,p+q - k , k ) s_2(p+q - k , k ) + & & t(k , p+q - k;q , p ) , ( s ) = -i ( 2 ) ^4 d^4 k ^(0 ) ( p+q , p+q - k , k ) s_2(p+q - k , k ) ( p+q - k , p+q , k ) , with the @xmath2 propagator @xmath33 given in .",
    "renormalisation imposes two requirements on the dressed s - channel diagram of the on - shell t matrix : ( i ) it must have a pole at @xmath51 , and ( ii ) the residue at this pole must be equal to @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , in terms of it is required that _ s m^2 .",
    "( p,p+q,q ) ( p+q , p , q ) s - m_0 ^ 2 - ( s ) | _ = .",
    "these two conditions are satisfied by appropriately choosing the bare mass @xmath44 and the bare coupling constant @xmath45 .",
    "the particular procedure used to fix @xmath44 and @xmath45 is immaterial , as long as renormalisation conditions are fulfilled ( for example , one can follow the standard renormalisation procedure described in @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalisation conditions are the same in both representations as they involve the representation - independent physical parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "we solve the bse for @xmath2 scattering in the two introduced representations . through solving the bse",
    "one sums up a certain class of loop diagrams up to infinite order .",
    "a question arises whether this class of loops is sufficient for the solution to obey the equivalence theorem . as we shall see",
    ", it is not the case .",
    "it is known that iterating the potential according to the bse does not generate certain loop diagrams which should be included in the full theory .",
    "up to one - loop level , this is illustrated in figs .",
    "( [ fig : tree_gnrl ] ) and ( [ fig:1loop_gnrl ] ) . at tree level , shown in , the scattering amplitude @xmath53 contains all the diagrams dictated by the lagrangians in both representations . as a consequence",
    ", the choice of representation does not affect the on - shell tree amplitude .",
    "at one - loop level , however , the bse generates only those diagrams which are shown in column a of for representation ( i ) and in columns a and c for representation ( ii ) .",
    "we note that the diagrams not generated in representation ( i ) would render the one - loop amplitude crossing symmetric .",
    "the set of diagrams missing from the bse in representation ( ii ) is larger : in addition to the graphs required by the crossing symmetry , also the loop correction to the 4-point vertex and the diagrams formed from the 5-point vertex are not generated .    in figs .",
    "( [ fig : phases_mod ] ) and ( [ fig : phases_f ] ) we compare the s - wave phase shifts for @xmath2 scattering obtained in representations ( i ) and ( ii ) . to ensure that the lagrangians and are indeed related by the field transformation , in both representations we kept the same coupling constant @xmath5 and the same cut - off parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the calculations",
    "shown we chose the same values for all the cut - offs , @xmath56 gev , and the transformation parameter @xmath16 was varied between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the phase shifts obtained in representations ( i ) and ( ii ) are denoted as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the extent of the representation - dependence of the phase shift is related to the difference @xmath61 . in",
    "we show the results obtained using two different values of @xmath16 . with decreasing energy the representation - dependence of the phase shift gets smaller as the loop contributions become less important .",
    "the difference between the amplitudes in the two representations is appreciable even at low energies , as can be seen by comparing the scattering lengths @xmath62 and @xmath63 calculated in the two representations .",
    "we have checked that it is impossible to find transformation parameters @xmath20 and @xmath16 ( except for the trivial case @xmath64 ) such that the phase shifts are the same in the two representations .",
    "the dependence of the difference between the phase shifts in the two representations on the transformation parameter @xmath16 is shown in for three different values of the scattering energy .    from the above considerations it follows that the observables which are dominated by the tree - level diagrams should not exhibit a noticeable dependence on the choice of representation in which the bse is solved . in the present calculation",
    "this is exemplified by the p - wave @xmath65 phase shift ( not shown ) , which is given almost exclusively by the tree - level kernel and is therefore not sensitive to the choice of representation .",
    "one frequently used approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation is the k - matrix approach ( see , e.g. , recent models @xcite ) .",
    "its essential simplifying feature is that the driving term , the k - matrix , is needed only with on - shell external particles and the scattering amplitude is obtained by algebraically iterating @xmath66 .",
    "the k matrix is traditionally chosen to be equal to a crossing symmetric on - shell tree - level amplitude .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the equivalence theorem holds for the amplitude obtained in the k - matrix approach .",
    "we verified that this is indeed the case .    in the calculations presented so far ,",
    "the regularisation form factors @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath15 were incorporated in the lagrangian and in the transformation . in order to check that the reached conclusions are not an artefact of this regularisation procedure",
    ", we have solved a bse for @xmath2 scattering using the local analogues of the lagrangian and transformation .",
    "the kernel of the equation is obtained in both representations by substituting unity for the form factors @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath15 . in this calculation , we chose a simple and pragmatic way to regularise the bse : the measure in was covariantly deformed as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a cut - off mass .",
    "the phase shift calculated using this model exhibits a representation - dependence which is qualitatively similar to the one discussed above for the explicitly non - local lagrangians and transformations .",
    "even though we presented our argument using a particular model , the preceding discussion suggests that the main conclusion of this study  that the on - shell scattering amplitude calculated from the bethe - salpeter equation is representation - dependent  has a rather wide validity .",
    "indeed , the bse does not generate the full set of loop diagrams adequate for the fulfillment of the equivalence theorem .",
    "in particular , this certainly is the case for all realistic dynamical models of hadronic interactions based on the bse .",
    "the choice of a convenient representation for constructing a tree - level kernel influences the solution of the bse even on - shell , and thus should be recognised as an additional model assumption .",
    "our results should , however , not be construed as a claim that the equivalence theorem would not hold _ in general _ ,",
    "i.e.  if one were able to calculate the amplitude including all the loop diagrams required by the lagrangian up to infinite order .",
    "formally , such a calculation could be furnished as a solution of the _ full _ bethe - salpeter equation which contains an infinite number of diagrams in its kernel .",
    "the situation we have studied , using the bse with a tree - level kernel , is more closely related to the type of calculations which are actually carried out .",
