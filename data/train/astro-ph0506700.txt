    "there are two major open questions that could be solved by the existence of a warm - hot and/or highly ionized phase of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) : the missing baryons at low redshift , @xmath14 - 0.5 , and the missing metals at @xmath15 .",
    "the baryon budget at low @xmath8 implies that about 45% of the cosmic baryons are still in the form of ionized gas in the igm ( fukugita98 ) .",
    "the missing baryonic matter could reside in a warm - hot igm ( whim ) as predicted by hierarchical structure formation models ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cen & ostriker 1999 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cooler phase of the whim can be probed by ovi@xmath16 absorption but , at the sensitivity of the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ surveys , the contribution to the cosmic baryon density , @xmath9 , of the detected ovi absorbers is only @xmath65% ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". the hotter phase of the whim , @xmath17 k , can be probed by ovii - oviii x - ray absorption .",
    "there are very few suitably bright targets for x - ray spectroscopy with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , and the rare confirmed detections , at a significance level higher than 3@xmath18 ( nicastro  2005a ,",
    "b ) , have ovii column densities about ten times larger than those of ovi . the contribution of this intergalactic hot phase to @xmath9 could be up to ten times higher than that of the cooler whim . at @xmath15 ,",
    "at least 90% of the baryons are in the ly-@xmath7 forest , but only about 10% of the metals produced by star formation activity in lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) have been detected up to now ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean metal enrichment of the igm could reach a value z @xmath19 0.04 z@xmath20 ( @xcite ) and recent simulations of galactic winds give estimates in the range 0.01 - 0.06 z@xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed civ cosmic density equals @xmath9(civ ) @xmath21 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and , assuming an ionization correction of about a factor two , leads to a cosmic abundance [ c / h]@xmath22 , thus a shortfall of metals by a factor of at least ten and maybe up to @xmath23 .",
    "the missing metals could reside in hot gaseous halos around star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the cooler part of these hot bubbles might be traced by ovi absorption .",
    "a few surveys of ovi absorbers at @xmath24 - 2.5 have already been conducted at the _ vlt _ and _ keck _ telescopes , some for only a limited number of sightlines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite,2004 ) .",
    "a non - negligible fraction , @xmath61/3 , of the ovi absorptions associated with the ly-@xmath7 forest have line widths @xmath25 km s@xmath13 , thus @xmath26 k , which favors a radiative ionization process . a hard uv background flux , i.e. small discontinuity at 4 ryd ( @xcite ) , reproduces well the observed ionic ratios for @xmath27 [ z / h ] @xmath28 .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath9(ovi ) of the above surveys are @xmath29 ( assuming @xmath30 0.7 , 0.3 , 0.04 , 70 throughout this paper ) . applying a conservative ionization correction , ovi / o=0.15 , yields a mean oxygen abundance of [ o / h]@xmath31 , and thus ,",
    "as for civ surveys , leaves open the problem of the missing metals .",
    "however , a higher metallicity has been derived for ov absorbers .",
    "the euv ov@xmath32 singlet was searched for and detected in a stacked composite absorption spectra from _ hst - fos _",
    "data for absorbers at @xmath33 with a large range of hi column densities ( @xcite ) . except in the strongest hi systems",
    ", the lack of detection of the associated euv oiv doublet also suggests a hard ionizing background flux , and the derived oxygen abundance is [ o / h]@xmath34 to @xmath35 .",

    "ovi sample is presented in   2 . in   3 ,",

    "we present our conclusions and prospectives in   6 .",

    "uves_. this allows a study of ovi systems in the range @xmath37 - 2.5 where the crowding of the ly-@xmath7 forest is not too severe .",
    "altogether , the sample comprises 21 bright quasars ( most with v @xmath38 17 ) , of which 19 are at @xmath39 , observed with dichroics blue and red .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath40 ( line width @xmath41 = 6.6 km s@xmath13 ) and the exposure time per setting per quasar ( 2 settings per quasar ) of 6 to 10 hr yields a signal - to - noise s / n @xmath6 30 - 40 and 100 at 3300 and 5500   respectively .",

    "these absorbers span the redshift interval 1.99 @xmath43 2.57 with a mean value of @xmath44 . due to partial blending of the associated hi absorptions and small velocity differences between the ovi and hi components , we group the ovi and hi absorptions into 51 systems .",
    "absorption systems within 5000 km s@xmath13 of the quasar emission redshift are excluded from this sample .",

    "are not present in every sightline , a large quasar sample is mandatory for a statistically significant number of metal - rich ovi absorbers .",
    "it is possible to define the class of metal - rich absorbers using observed column density ratios derived from photoionization models since the small line widths of a non - negligible fraction of the ovi systems imply `` low '' gas temperatures ( see   3.1 ) . adopting a hard uv background spectrum together with a 0.1 solar metallicity leads to observational identification criteria for the following classes of absorbers : + - type 1 : n(ovi)/n(hi ) @xmath47 0.25 : metal - rich absorbers , + - type 0 : n(ovi)/n(hi ) @xmath38 0.25 : metal - poor absorbers .",

    "about 70% of the ovi+civ - only type 1 absorbers have weak associated hi lines , log n(hi ) @xmath38 13.6 , and the type 0 and type 1 ovi absorbers span roughly the same n(ovi ) range .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of searching for ovi systems whatever the strength of their associated hi aborption .",

    "the histogram of ovi line widths is shown in figure  [ fig : histb ] .",
    "there are 81 , 39 and 16 ovi components for the types 0 , 1 and 2 absorbers , respectively . the bulk of the @xmath41 distributions of the types 0 and 1 overlap , but not their high velocity tails .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that these distributions indeed differ at the 98% confidence level .",
    "it should be stressed that among the broader absorbers , @xmath52 km s@xmath13 , most components are blends of several ovi lines within a velocity range of a few tens of km s@xmath13 .",
    "very few individual components are unambiguously broad .",
    "close to half ( 43% ) of the ovi absorbers have line widths @xmath53 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this confirms the results previously found with smaller ovi samples . the implied temperatures , @xmath54 k , as also found for the non - saturated associated lyman lines , are too low for ovi to be produced by collisional ionization even for abundances close to solar .",
    "we will thus assume that photoionization is the dominant ionization process , but will also consider simple cases where there is additional collisional heating of the gas , possibly through shocks .",
    "following previous discussions on constraints of the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing background flux ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we select a hard uv metagalactic flux ( @xcite ) to derive the gas ionization level .",
    "we used the cloudy v94.0 code ( @xcite ) to estimate ionic column density ratios as a function of the ionization parameter , @xmath55 , and assumed solar relative abundances ( @xcite ) . for each system , the value of @xmath56 is fixed by the observed ionic ratio n(ovi)/n(civ ) which is applicable only if ovi and civ are in the same phase .",
    "this should be the case for most absorbers as siiv is not detected , except in a few systems with large n(hi ) ( @xmath57 cm @xmath58 ) .",
    "the observed range of n(ovi)/n(civ ) implies @xmath59 log @xmath60 , thus an ionization ratio 0.09  @xmath61  ovi / o  @xmath61  0.21 .",
    "the distributions of the derived oxygen abundances are presented in figure  [ fig : histo_h ] for the 31 , 14 and 6 ovi systems of type 0 , 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "contrary to the distribution of @xmath41(ovi ) shown above , there is very little overlap between the [ o / h ] distributions of the types 0 and 1 populations .",
    "this further suggests that they are indeed two distinct populations .",
    "the type 2 [ o / h ] distribution spans a small range in between those of the other two populations .",

    "the [ o / h ] median values for the cases 1 , 2 and 3 are @xmath620.33 , @xmath620.80 and @xmath620.35 , respectively.,width=226 ]      to confirm the difference in metallicity between the type 0 ( population tracing the igm ) and type 1 ( population tracing highly metal - enriched sites ) absorbers , we investigate whether other ionization conditions could yield much lower abundances for the type 1 population .",
    "first , we consider a gas phase of constant density , @xmath63 , thus a single value of the ionization paramater .",
    "we select an overdensity @xmath64 at @xmath65 which is within the range of values found in the previous ovi surveys .",
    "this yields log @xmath66 , thus an ionization ratio ovi / o = 0.16 . in a large fraction of these cases , ovi and civ",
    "do not trace the same phase .",
    "secondly , we reconsider photoionization by a hard uv background flux but now with the gas temperature derived from the @xmath41 value of the main ovi component of each system . this is to account for possible additional shock heating .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is still derived from the observed n(ovi)/n(civ ) ionic ratio .",
    "there is no solution for absorbers with @xmath67 k , or @xmath68 km s@xmath13 , implying that at these higher temperatures ovi and civ are not co - spatial .",
    "however , for the type 1 systems , the main ovi component is always narrower than 14 km s@xmath13 except in the case of one ovi doublet blended with lyman lines .",
    "together with the case of pure photoionization , the distributions of the oxygen abundances estimated in the above two cases are shown in figure  [ fig : histo_hall ] .",
    "although the values of [ o / h ] are somewhat lower under the new ionization conditions , they remain far higher than those of the type 0 population .",
    "this confirms that the types 0 and 1 ovi absorbers trace markedly different populations .",
    "the column density distribution , @xmath1(n ) , of ovi absorbers per unit redshift path per unit column density can be written : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of ovi absorbers in a column density bin @xmath71 centered on n for a sample of quasars with total redshift path @xmath72 . for our adopted cosmology",
    ", the redshift path is defined as : @xmath73 @xmath74    the ovi column density distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : ndistr ] .",
    "it can be seen that the present data become incomplete below a column density of @xmath75 cm@xmath58 and that sample variance may be important at column densities larger than @xmath77 cm@xmath58 . in between these limits , a power - law fit ( @xmath1(n ) @xmath2 n@xmath3 ) gives @xmath78 .",
    "to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath7 , we shift the @xmath79n bins by 0.1 dex and derive new power - law fits .",
    "this yields @xmath80 and a normalization of @xmath1(n ) @xmath5 at log n(ovi ) = 13.5 , with a @xmath630% uncertainty .",
    "the value of the power - law index is similar to that obtained from civ samples , @xmath7(civ ) @xmath81 , such as those drawn from the _ vlt - uves _ large programme at @xmath82(civ ) = 2.16 ( @xcite ) or from _ keck - hires _ data at higher redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power - law fit of the latter ( corrected for the different adopted cosmological parameters ) is also shown in figure  [ fig : ndistr ] . at n(ovi ) = n(civ ) = @xmath83 cm@xmath58 , the value of @xmath1(n ) for ovi absorbers is nearly a factor of ten larger than that for civ absorbers .",
    "log n(ovi ) @xmath38 14.3 ( see text ) .",
    "the dotted line is the fit to the column density distribution of civ absorbers given by songaila ( 2001).,width=302 ]      we use the power - law fit to @xmath1(n ) for the ovi population to estimate the number density per unit @xmath8 of ovi absorbers : @xmath84 we select conservative n(ovi ) limits of @xmath85 and @xmath86 cm@xmath58 , a range that is not drastically affected by incompleteness or sample variance . adopting the fit with @xmath7 = 1.71 , we then get @xmath87 at @xmath88 . taking into account the range of possible values of the power - law index and normalization factor of @xmath1(n ) , we obtain @xmath89 .    at low redshift , @xmath90 , surveys with _ fuse _ and",
    "_ hst _ give @xmath91 for a rest - equivalent width limit of @xmath92  m , or log n(ovi)=13.60 in the optically thin case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for this column density limit , we get @xmath93 at @xmath88 , whereas we expect a somewhat higher value , @xmath94 , in the case of an unevolving ovi population .",
    "however , comparison between the values of @xmath11 at @xmath90 and 2.3 is not straightforward as ovi absorbers may trace different populations at low and high redshift .",
    "the ovi cosmic density can be expressed as a mass fraction relative to the critical density , @xmath95 .",
    "it can be estimated either from the individual , observed ovi column densities or using the power - law fit to @xmath1(n ) of ovi absorbers to correct for incompleteness .",
    "the mean cosmic density of a given ion can be expressed as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the hubble constant , @xmath98 and @xmath99 the atomic mass and the sum of the column densities of the given ion , respectively , and @xmath72 the total redshift path .",
    "for our ovi sample , we obtain @xmath9(ovi)@xmath100 , a value higher than previous estimates by a factor 1.3 ( @xcite : sample restricted to ovi systems with strong , associated hi absorption [ see   2.1 ] ) and 1.8 ( @xcite : two sightlines , none with very strong ovi absorbers ) .",
    "the contribution of the ovi type 1 population to @xmath9(ovi ) is 35% .",
    "the mean cosmic density of ovi ions can also be written as :    @xmath101    using our fit with @xmath7 = 1.71 and the same n(ovi ) limits as in   4.2 ,",
    "we get @xmath9(ovi ) @xmath102 , thus an incompleteness correction factor of 2.3 at @xmath88 .",
    "the uncertainty in the power - law fit of @xmath1(n ) leads to values in the range @xmath103(ovi ) @xmath104 .    to estimate the mean cosmic density of oxygen , @xmath9(o )",
    ", we use the ovi mean ionization level obtained in the pure photoionization case , @xmath105ovi / o@xmath106 = 0.15 ( see   3.2 ) . under the other ionization conditions investigated in   3.3 ,",
    "this ratio is either similar or smaller .",
    "we then get @xmath9(o ) @xmath107 .    using the solar oxygen abundance given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , yields : +    log  ( @xmath9(o)/@xmath9(o)@xmath108 .",
    "this result demands attention for the two following reasons : ( 1 ) the above value is close to the median of [ o / h ] found for the ovi type 0 absorbers ( igm ) , [ o / h ] = @xmath622.07 , but well below that of the ovi type 1 absorbers ( metal - enriched sites ) , [ o / h ] = @xmath620.33 ( see figures  [ fig : histo_h ] and [ fig : histo_hall ] ) , and ( 2 ) it is smaller than the mean metal enrichment of the igm by star - forming galaxies at @xmath15 ( z@xmath109 ) by a factor of about 3.7 and 6.6 when adopting the values of z@xmath110 1/45 and 1/25 solar as given by ferrara  ( 2005 ) and pettini ( 1999 ) , respectively . consequently , there is still a shortfall of observed metals as compared to those produced by lbgs , but about a factor three smaller than previously thought .",
    "our sample contains very few cases of unambiguously broad ovi doublets ( @xmath52 km s@xmath13 ) which could trace hotter parts ( @xmath111 k ) of metal - rich sites .",
    "however , if most of the gas in these sites is at even higher temperatures , oxygen will then mainly be in the form of ovii and oviii ions and not detectable with present - day x - ray satellites .",
    "from a pixel analysis of _ vlt - uves _ large programme quasar spectra , aracil   ( 2004 ) found that weak ovi absorption associated with weak hi absorption ( 0.2 @xmath112(ly-@xmath7 ) @xmath38 1 or 12.9 @xmath38 log n(hi ) @xmath38 13.6 for @xmath41(hi ) = 30 km s@xmath13 ) is predominantly detected in the vicinity ( @xmath113 300 km s@xmath13 ) of strong hi absorption ( @xmath114(ly-@xmath7 ) @xmath47 4 ) .",

    "moreover , the values of @xmath127 for @xmath680% of the type 1 population ( log @xmath128 ) do not overlap with those obtained for the type 0 population .",
    "we now compare in figure  [ fig : rhoug ] the values of @xmath123 and @xmath127 to check the validity of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium . for the type 0 absorbers , a spearman rank correlation test shows that @xmath127 and @xmath123 are correlated at a @xmath4799% confidence level .",
    "the mean value of their @xmath129 overdensity ratio is close to 2.0 .",
    "it can not be substantially decreased as its dependence on @xmath120(hi ) , mass fraction in gas and @xmath130 is small ( @xmath131(hi)@xmath132 @xmath133 ) .",
    "therefore , this departure of @xmath129 from unity may suggest that a fraction of the observed hi is not in the ovi phase .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between @xmath127 and @xmath123 suggests that the ovi type 0 population is roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium . for the type 1 absorbers ,",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath123 are totally uncorrelated which implies that hydrostatic equilibrium is not a valid assumption for this population : low hi column density absorbers do not trace low density regions of the igm .",
    "this further supports that the metal - rich and metal - poor absorbers trace different populations .",
    "our large _ vlt - uves _ sample of 136 ovi absorbers at @xmath44 towards ten quasars enables a study of the highly ionized phase of the igm , in particular its metal enrichment and contribution to the cosmic baryon density .",
    "previous ovi studies at high @xmath8 have uncovered a few systems with high [ o / h ] ( @xmath134 ) abundances , motivating us to fully investigate this class of metal - rich absorbers .",
    "because those systems already identified have low hi column densities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , our sample includes all detected ovi systems whatever the strength of their associated hi absorption .",
    "in contrast , the survey by simcoe  ( 2004 ) only includes systems with n(hi ) @xmath135 cm@xmath58 .",
    "we restrict our sample to absorbers with both lines of the ovi doublet clearly detected or , if partially blended , enough unambiguous structure to allow for deblending from lyman lines .    since nearly half of the ovi absorbers have small line widths , @xmath53 km s@xmath13 or @xmath54 k , photoionization must be the dominant ionization process .",
    "we thus introduce an observational identification criterium to separate the classes of metal - poor ( type 0 ) and metal - rich ( type 1 ) absorbers . selecting a hard uv background flux",
    "( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and assuming a 0.1 solar metallicity yields a column density ratio n(ovi)/n(civ ) @xmath136 and @xmath137 for the type 0 and type 1 populations , respectively .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath41 distributions of these two ovi populations are similar except at the highest velocities .",

    ". the overall [ o / h ] distribution is clearly bimodal with median values of [ o / h ] equal to @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the type 0 and type 1 populations , respectively .",
    "this is not a consequence of a strong difference in ionization levels between the two types of ovi absorbers .",
    "all of the type 1 ovi systems and all but two of the type 0 systems have associated civ absorption ( detection limit of n(civ ) @xmath141 cm@xmath58 ) .",
    "their n(ovi)/n(civ ) distributions , which cover about two orders of magnitude , are similar with median values both close to 10 . a high metallicity ( median [ o / h ] @xmath142 ) for the type 1 population",
    "is still found under different ionization conditions : photoionization together with either a gas phase of constant density ( overdensity @xmath143 at @xmath144 ) or a temperature fixed by the line width of the main ovi component of each system ( always @xmath145 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the n(nv)/n(ovi ) ratio can not be used to constrain the ionization level of the ovi phase because the n / o relative abundance departs from the solar value . in most ovi absorbers ,",
    "the nv doublet is weak or undetected and the nitrogen abundance relative to oxygen is usually well below solar ( @xcite ) . for a very few ovi systems ,",
    "the strength of the nv absorption is similar to those of civ and ovi and the nitrogen abundance may be enhanced relative to that of oxygen ( @xcite ) , as also observed in quasar associated systems ( e.g. @xcite ) . in our type 1 ovi sample , associated nv absorption is either absent or very weak , except in one case already reported by bergeron  ( 2002 ) .",
    "this absorber at @xmath146 in q 0329@xmath62385 was labelled as `` intrinsic '' by these authors because its properties are typical of those of associated systems , even though it is at 6200 km s@xmath13 from the quasar emission redshift .",
    "our ovi sample is large enough to derive the first estimate of the ovi column density distribution , although incompleteness becomes evident at n(ovi ) @xmath147 cm@xmath58 and sample variance may be important at n(ovi ) @xmath148 cm@xmath58 .",
    "a power - law fit , @xmath1(n ) @xmath2 n@xmath3 , yields @xmath149 , a value similar to that found for civ samples , @xmath7(civ ) @xmath81 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the normalization factor , @xmath1(n ) @xmath5 ( with an uncertainty of @xmath6 30% ) at n(ovi ) = @xmath83 cm@xmath58 , is about ten times larger than that of civ absorbers .",
    "we aim to better constrain @xmath1(n ) , particularly at large ovi column densities , by analyzing a larger number of sightlines in a future paper .",
    "there we will also include blended ovi components associated with civ absorption .",
    "we use the fit to @xmath1(n ) in a conservative n(ovi ) range , @xmath85-@xmath86 cm@xmath58 , to estimate the number density per unit @xmath8 of ovi absorbers as well as their cosmic density .",
    "this is a first step for correcting @xmath11 and @xmath9(ovi ) from incompleteness and sample variance .",
    "we find @xmath150 .",
    "selecting an integration range as wide as is usually adopted for civ ( @xmath151-@xmath152 cm@xmath58 ) would yield a larger value of @xmath11 ( and of @xmath9(ovi ) ) but the uncertainty on the result would then be far too large . in the case of an unevolving population and a column density lower limit equal to that of low @xmath153 ovi surveys , that is n(ovi)@xmath154 cm@xmath58 or @xmath92  m   ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "the expected value of @xmath11 at @xmath155 derived from the low @xmath8 samples is 36 ( assuming a 0.1 solar metallicity and an ionic fraction ovi / o = 0.2 ) , whereas that obtained from our @xmath1(n ) distribution equals 26 .",
    "the suggested decline of @xmath11 with @xmath8 is not straightforward to interpret as the ovi absorbers may trace different populations at low and high @xmath8 .",
    "the ovi cosmic density estimated from the individual , observed column densities is @xmath9(ovi)@xmath156 , i.e. higher than previous estimates by a factor 1.3 ( @xcite ) and 1.8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this increase is due to the high contribution ( 35% ) of the type 1 population to @xmath9(ovi ) .",
    "the value derived from the @xmath1(n ) distribution is 2.3 times larger : @xmath9(ovi)@xmath12 .",
    "this illustrates the effects of incompleteness and sample variance in our sample , even within the conservative n(ovi ) range adopted . to get the element cosmic density",
    ", we use the mean ionic fraction obtained in the pure photoionization case , @xmath105ovi / o@xmath106 = 0.15 , which yields @xmath9(o ) @xmath107 . adopting the solar oxygen abundance given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , we get log  @xmath157(o)/@xmath9(o)@xmath158 .",
    "this value is well below that of the metal - rich population and also smaller than the metal enrichment of the igm expected from high @xmath8 star - forming galaxies , @xmath105[o / h]@xmath159 ( @xcite ) or @xmath160 ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the problem of missing metals at high @xmath8 ( where previously an order of magnitude disparity was measured ) is now less severe as a result of our ovi survey , there remains a shortfall of observed metals by about a factor of four as compared to those produced by star - forming galaxies .",
    "other properties of the type 1 ovi absorbers suggest a tight link to galactic halos .",
    "this population is predominantly detected in the vicinity ( @xmath117 450 km s@xmath13 ) of strong hi systems ( @xmath114(ly-@xmath7 ) @xmath47 4 ) .",
    "this is also the case for civ - only metal - rich absorbers ( ovi doublet either outside the observing range , @xmath51 , or fully blended with saturated lyman lines ) . in the photoionization case , the type 0 and type 1 ovi absorbers have the same gas overdensity distribution , with a median value @xmath124 , but under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium the gas overdensity , @xmath161 , distributions of these two populations barely overlap .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath162 and @xmath161 are totally uncorrelated for the metal - rich population , whereas they are well correlated for the metal - poor population .",
    "consequently , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is not valid for the metal - rich ovi population : these absorbers do not trace low density regions of the igm but rather gas outflows in the vicinity of active star - formation sites .",
    "if most of the gas in the metal - rich sites is at high temperature ( @xmath163 k ) , as suggested by pettini ( 1999 ) , oxygen will mainly be in the form of ovii and oviii ions and their signatures in the very soft x - ray range are not detectable with present - day x - ray satellites . for a phase at lower temperatures , @xmath164  k",
    ", the ovi and hi species , but not civ ( ionic fraction civ / c @xmath165 ) , should be detectable .",
    "we have begun to search for these absorbers with broad ( @xmath166 km s@xmath13 ) , weak ly-@xmath7 lines associated with semi - broad , weak ovi doublets ( @xmath167 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "this is coupled to a statistical analysis of the ly-@xmath7 forest in simulated spectra ( in progress ) .",
    "we also plan to acquire deep , multi - band images of the quasar fields with several metal - rich ovi absorbers .",
    "if this population does indeed trace hot galactic halos , we expect to find a strong correlation with star - forming galaxies .",
    "using these images together with spectroscopic follow - up of the associated galaxies may help clarify the ejection mechanism(s ) responsible for the metal - pollution of galactic halos and the surrounding igm ."
