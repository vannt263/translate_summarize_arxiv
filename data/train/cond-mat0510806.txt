    "in recent years there has been a great interest in the study of absorption effects on transport properties of classically chaotic cavities @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "this is due to the fact that for experiments in microwave cavities  @xcite , elastic resonators  @xcite and elastic media",
    "@xcite absorption always is present .",
    "although the external parameters are particularly easy to control , absorption , due to power loss in the volume of the device used in the experiments , is an ingredient that has to be taken into account in the verification of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) predictions .    in a microwave experiment of a ballistic chaotic cavity connected to a waveguide supporting one propagating mode , doron _",
    "@xcite studied the effect of absorption on the @xmath0 sub - unitary scattering matrix @xmath1 , parametrized as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reflection coefficient and @xmath4 is twice the phase shift .",
    "the experimental results were explained by lewenkopf _",
    "_  @xcite by simulating the absorption in terms of @xmath5 equivalent  parasitic channels \" , not directly accessible to experiment , each one having an imperfect coupling to the cavity described by the transmission coefficient @xmath6 .    a simple model to describe chaotic scattering including absorption was proposed by kogan _ et al . _",
    "it describes the system through a sub - unitary scattering matrix @xmath1 , whose statistical distribution satisfies a maximum information - entropy criterion . unfortunately the model turns out to be valid only in the strong - absorption limit and for @xmath7 . for the @xmath0 @xmath1-matrix of eq .",
    "( [ s11 ] ) , it was shown that in this limit @xmath4 is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath8 , while @xmath3 satisfies rayleigh s distribution @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the universality class of @xmath1 introduced by dyson  @xcite : @xmath11 when time reversal invariance ( tri ) is present ( also called the _ orthogonal _ case ) , @xmath12 when tri is broken ( _ unitary _ case ) and @xmath13 corresponds to the symplectic case . here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is the ratio of the mean dwell time inside the cavity ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 is the mean level spacing , and @xmath18 is the absorption time .",
    "this ratio is a measure of the absorption strength .",
    "( [ rayleigh ] ) is valid for @xmath19 and for @xmath20 as we shall see below .",
    "the weak absorption limit ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath22 was calculated by beenakker and brouwer  @xcite , by relating @xmath3 to the time - delay in a chaotic cavity which is distributed according to the laguerre ensemble .",
    "the distribution of the reflexion coefficient in this case is @xmath23 in the whole range of @xmath24 , @xmath22 was explicitly obtained for @xmath12  @xcite : @xmath25 , \\label{beta2}\\ ] ] and for @xmath13 more recently  @xcite .",

    "( [ laguerre ] ) for small absorption ( @xmath21 ) while for strong absorption it becomes @xmath26 notice that @xmath27 approaches zero for @xmath3 close to one .",

    "as can be seen the result obtained from the time - delay agrees with the exact result but the rayleigh distribution is only valid for @xmath7 .    since the majority of the experiments with absorption are performed with tri ( @xmath11 )",
    "it is very important to have the result in this case . due to the lack of an exact expression at that time",

    "the distribution @xmath34 then yields a quite complicated formula .    due to the importance to have an `` easy to use '' formula for the time reversal case ,",
