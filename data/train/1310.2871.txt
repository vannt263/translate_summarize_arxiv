    "it has long been understood that , in general relativity gravitational phenomena are the physical manifestation of spacetime curvature .",
    "nevertheless , gravitational wave detectors , which make physical measurements , are typically described as responding to spacetime metric perturbations , which are coordinate gauge dependent and  correspondingly  unphysical quantities . just as early attempts to understand gravitational waves in terms of metric perturbations led to confusion regarding whether such waves existed or how they might be generated , so attempts to describe how gravitational wave detectors respond to metric perturbations lead to wooly statements and , sometimes , outright misconceptions @xcite . by way of contrast , gravitational waves described as spacetime curvature perturbations are , in a well - defined sense @xcite , physically unambiguous quantities ; correspondingly , describing the gravitational wave detector response in terms of the detector s interaction with spacetime curvature may be expected to be , if nothing else , conceptually more satisfying and physically more revealing . here",
    "we derive and describe the response of a wide class of gravitational wave antennas  including pulsar timing arrays , spacecraft doppler tracking , and both ground- and space - based laser interferomteric detectors  in a way that relies solely upon physical measurements and the physical properties of spacetime as described by the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "the resulting expression of the detector response , and each term that comprises it , is separately gauge invariant and has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "we show that when the gravitational waves can be described as a gauge independent curvature perturbation of a background spacetime the wave contribution to the response is wholly embodied in an integration of a projection of riemann curvature tensor perturbation along specific null geodesics of the unperturbed spacetime .",
    "our principle result is directly applicable to gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing or spacecraft doppler tracking ; is the building - block upon which a physically and pedagogically satisfying description of the response of interferometeric antennas may be based ; can form the basis for a simplified and general derivation of a fully relativistic pulsar timing formula ; and may be used to simplify the use of numerial relativity simulations to aid in the analysis or interpretation of gravitational wave detector observations .",
    "@xcite described the operation of the first practical gravitational wave detector in terms of riemann curvature induced excitations of the oscillation modes of a high quality - factor metal bar . throughout the",
    "1960 s a variety of mechanical gravitational wave antenna configurations were proposed ( a qualitative summary of many of these configurations is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1013 ) ) and their responses were generally described in an approximate way through a coupling to the riemann curvature as well . by the early 1970s , however , a description of gravitational waves in terms of metric perturbations had taken hold .",
    "this was the case from the start for interferometric gravitational wave antennas @xcite and their kin : spacecraft doppler tracking @xcite and pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "this trend of describing gravitational wave antenna response to metric perturbations has generally persisted throughout the literature to this day @xcite .    as is well known , however , metric perturbations depend on coordinate gauge choices .",
    "while the freedom to choose a gauge may be exploited to simplify some computations , it is perilous to give physical meaning to partial or intermediate results of these calculations . nevertheless , throughout the literature  research and pedagogical",
    " one finds numerous ( and sometimes conflicting ) descriptions of how a gravitational wave physically produces a signal in a detector based on an interpretation of the terms in calculations that depend on a choice of coordinate gague . for example , it is routinely claimed ( though we give only single , recent examples from the literature ) that gravitational waves physically move freely - falling test masses in an ideal interferometric detector ( * ? ? ?",
    "21 ) ; gravitational waves `` push '' the mirrors of an ideal interferometric detector apart and together ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lecture 1 page 1 ) ; spacetime curvature influences light differently than it does mirror separations in an interferometer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lecture 1 page 2 ) ; gravitational waves alternately redshift and blueshift the light in an interferometer detector @xcite ; it is the direct affect of gravitational waves on the earth and a distant pulsar that we measure when we detect when we observe gravitational waves via pulsar timing @xcite ; and it is the affect of gravitational waves on the trajectory of the light passing between a pulsar and earth that leads to their detection @xcite .",
    "in fact , as is apparent by appropriate application of the equivalence principle , each of these statements is incorrect ; that they are made at all is the result of ascribing physical significance to gauge - dependent quantities .",
    "other authors have explored alternative derivations or expressions of the gravitational wave detector response in terms of the riemann curvature @xcite ; however , these discussions either start from the metric perturbation in a preferred gauge or apply , in an approximate way , the geodesic deviation equation to describe the deviation vector between non - geodesics .",
    "additionally , these descriptions ( as well as most formulations coupling to the metric perturbation ) generally make the crucial assumption that the background spacetime is minkowski or that the different detector components ( beamsplitter and end mirrors for interferometers or the earth and a pulsar for pulsar timing ) are at some coordinate rest in a preferred gauge .",
    "the description of the response we present here makes no assumptions regarding the geometry of the background spacetime and involves , from beginning to end , only physical measurements and gauge - independent quantities : i.e. , it is valid in an arbitrary background spacetime and never requires or invokes any special gauge or gauge - dependent quantities .    in section [ sec : doppler ]",
    "we provide a general , geometrically motivated derivation for the observed phase evolution of a remote clock . in section [ sec :",
    "gwaves ] we review how and when spacetime curvature may be physically and unambiguously separated into background and gravitational wave perturbation contributions , each of which is separately gauge independent , and show that , when such a distrinction is possible , the gravitational wave contribution to the observed clock phase is entirely due to the gravitational wave contribution to the curvature .",
    "we discuss the meaning and application of our results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we end in section [ sec : conclusions ] with some brief conclusions and directions for future study .",
    "gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing @xcite , spacecraft doppler tracking @xcite , and ground- or space - based laser interferometry @xcite all involve measuring the phase of a remote clock via an electromagnetic signal that propagates through spacetime along ( piecewise ) null geodesics . the location of the clock , the receiver / observer , and the path taken by the electromagnetic record of the phase as it is transferred from the clock to the receiver / observer differ ; however , the measured record of the clock phase following its propagation along the null trajectory is the defining characteristic of these detectors . in this section",

    "expressing the detector response in terms of the gauge independent riemann , as opposed to the metric perturbation in a specific gauge , eliminates unecessary steps and associated numerical errors when using numerical relativity simulations to aid in the analysis or interpretation of gravitational wave observations .      with equations [ eq : dopplerdisc ] , [ eq : dopplerpertdisc ] and the intermediate results summarized in appendix [ sec : scaling ] we are in a position to address the mistatements and misconceptions , highlighed in section [ sec : intro ] , that have appeared in the pedagogical and research literature regarding how gravitational wave detectors function and what they respond to .",

    "an important property of this result is its agreement with the einstein equivalence principle @xcite , which asserts that true gravitational effects are discernible only in experiments of sufficiently large scale .",
    "this should be no less the case for gravitational waves than for all other gravitational phenomena .",

    "viewed from the perspective of gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing ( or spacecraft doppler tracking ) , the gravitational wave contribution to the observed pulse arrival time at earth depends on the riemann curvature along the path traversed by the electromagnetic signal from the distant pulsar : i.e. , contrary to the shibboleth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) that pulsar timing measures the effect of gravitational waves near earth and the pulsar , _ the spacetime properties in the immediate neighborhood of the earth and the pulsar are irrelevant for the detection of gravitational waves via pulsar timing . _",

    "the starting point for the discussion here is the physical measurement made at the receiver observer .",
    "the analysis that follows is fully relativistic , invokes no special coordinate systems , gauges , or privileged observers , and ends with a fully general result that involves only the intrinsic properties of the clock , the receiver / observer , their respective worldlines , and the spacetime geometry .",

    "the equation of geodesic deviation arises as a matter of course and not as a fundamental precept .",
    "in contrast , @xcite begin by asserting that the geodesic deviation equation describes the instantaneous spatial separation ( in some ill - defined detector `` rest - frame '' ) between the coordinate stationary world lines of the clock ( laser / beamsplitter ) and the receiver / observer ( end mirror ) , which may not be geodesics . the spatial separation divided by the light - speed @xmath156 ,",
    "is then supposed to give the light travel time from clock to observer .",
    "finally , the observed phase is calculated under the assumption that the gravitational radiation wavelength is much longer than the detector size or light - storage time . in these descriptions geodesic deviation",
    "is applied heuristically to characterize a coordinate dependent non - deviation vector between two non - geodesics .",
    "previous analyses that depend upon or involve in some way the geodesic deviation equation , while doubtless having some heuristic value , offer , at best , results valid only in very special circumstances : a minkowski background , detectors small compared to a radiation wavelength and with light storage times short compared to the radiation period . they are not generalizable to backgrounds that are not minkowski , detectors that approach or exceed a radiation wavelength ( e.g. , lisa , spacecraft doppler tracking or pulsar timing ) , or detectors whose light storage time approaches or exceeds a radiation period ( e.g. , ligo and khz frequency gravitational waves associated with neutron star binary coalescence ) . finally , these derivations , through their focus on special coordinate systems where clock and receiver position and spatial separation can be said to play an important role , suggest that , in some way , gravitational radiation violates the equivalence principle and can be measured at a point . in this way",
    "the heuristic picture they offer is not that different than one focused upon metric perturbations .",
    "most modern gravitational wave detectors  including laser interferometers , pulsar timing arrays , spacecraft doppler tracking  rely upon the waves effect on light travel time to detect the wave s presence .",
    "the response of these detectors is conventionally expressed in terms of a metric perturbation description of the gravitational waves .",
    "metric perturbations , however , are coordinate gauge dependent quantities .",
    "their use obscures the physical nature of the gravitational wave phenomena and the principles that governs the operation of these detectors @xcite and lead to `` explanations '' of detector function that are at odds with the equivalence principle , which is the most basic assertion of general relativity .",
    "the response of modern gravitational wave detectors may also be expressed in terms of their interaction with spacetime curvature , which is the physically unambiguous property of spacetime that , in general relativity , underlies all gravitational phenomena .",
    "such an expression of the detector response , and each term that comprises it , is separately gauge invariant and has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the expression for the response is manifestly consistent with the equivalence principle : i.e. , the role of all gravitational phenonmena in the response  wave or otherwise  clearly involves measurements made over finite spacetime intervals . the gravitational wave contribution to",
    "the response is separately identifiable and the way in which it leads to light - time fluctuations in the detector avoids all the suspect analogies ( moving mirrors , redshifting and blueshifting of light , etc . )",
    "that plague descriptions of detector functioning based upon metric perturbations .",
    "contributions from other physical phenomena also appear naturally : e.g. , in the case of pulsar timing , all geometrical and kinematical effects ( rmer delay , parallax , aberration , shklovskii effect @xcite ) , special relativistic and general relativistic effects ( special and general relativistic einstein delay , shapiro time delay and gravitational wave contributions ) all appear naturally .",
    "the `` curvature - based '' response function describes all light - time based detectors in all regimes : i.e. , terrestrial laser interferometric detectors , whose physical dimensions and light storage times are shorter than the typical radiation wavelength @xcite ; proposed space - based detectors based upon the lisa heritage , where the detector size and light storage time is on - order the radiation wavelength @xcite ; and spacecraft doppler and pulsar timing , where the radiation wavelength is very much shorter than the detector size or light storage time @xcite .",
    "it meshes well with the use of numerical relativity calculation to determine detector response : i.e. , it does not require extracting from these calculations gauge dependent quantities that are not directly calculated in order to compute the director response .    in companions papers we shall explore in greater depth how expressing the gravitational wave response in terms of the riemann curvature can be applied to delay - line and fabrey - perot interferometric detectors ; the role of non - uniform motion ( e.g. , rotation ) in lisa - heritage detectors ; the effects of micro - lensing in pulsar timing gravitational wave detection @xcite ; and the use of the riemann curvature response function to provide an alternative derivation of a general - relativistic pulsar timing formula .    sometime in",

    "<S> gravitational wave detectors are typically described as responding to gravitational wave metric perturbations , which are gauge - dependent and  correspondingly  unphysical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for ground - based interferometric detectors , like ligo , space - based detectors , like lisa and its derivatives , spacecraft doppler tracking detectors , and pulsar timing arrays detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the description of gravitational waves , and a gravitational wave detector s response , to the unphysical metric perturbation has lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how these detectors function , and true misunderstandings of the physical character of gravitational waves .    </S>",
    "<S> here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the response of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the riemann curvature , the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena in general relativity . in the limit of high frequency gravitational waves , </S>",
    "<S> the riemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities : a `` background '' curvature contribution and a `` wave '' curvature contribution . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces to an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along the unperturbed photon path between components of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the description presented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a gravitational wave detector measures and how it operates , a simple means of computing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion , a straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity simulations to gravitational wave detection , and a basis for a general and fully relativistic pulsar timing formula . </S>"
