    "the classification of manifolds with certain properties is a central topic of topology , and in dimensions @xmath3 methods from handlebody theory and surgery have been successfully applied to a number of cases .",
    "one of the first examples was the complete classification of simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds by smale @xcite and barden @xcite in 1960 s .",

    "a classification of these manifolds in the smooth ( or pl ) and the topological category is given in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "we give a simple set of invariants , namely the rank of @xmath10 and the @xmath11-bordism ( @xmath12-bordism ) class of the characteristic submanifold , which determine the diffeomorphism ( homeomorphism ) types . in the smooth case ,",
    "the main result of the classification is :    two smooth , closed , orientable fibered type  @xmath0-manifolds @xmath4 and @xmath13 with fundamental group @xmath1 and torsion free second homology group are diffeomorphic if and only if they have the same @xmath14-type , @xmath15 , and @xmath16=[p ' ] \\in \\omega _ 4^{\\operatorname{pin}^{\\dagger } } /\\pm$ ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic submanifolds and @xmath19 for @xmath14-types i , , respectively .    the homeomorphism classification is given in theorem [ thm : two ] .",
    "we also determine all the relation among these invariants ( theorem [ thm : three ] ) , and give a list of standard forms for these manifolds ( theorem [ thm : four ] , theorem [ thm : four.five ] ) .",
    "one motivation for this classification problem comes from the study of circle bundles @xmath7 over simply - connected @xmath2-manifolds , since their total spaces are of fibered type .",
    "duan - liang @xcite gave an explicit geometric description of @xmath7 for simply - connected total spaces , making essential use of the results of smale and barden .",

    "classification results can also be useful in studying the existence problem for geometric structures on fibered type  @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "for example , a closed , orientable @xmath0-manifold with @xmath30 , such that @xmath14 vanishes on homology , admits a contact structure by the work of geiges and thomas @xcite .",
    "they showed that all such manifolds can be obtained by surgery on @xmath31-dimensional links from exactly one of ten model manifolds .",
    "the topology of such manifolds of fibered type  are described explicitly for the first time by our results , and we note that all the manifolds in the list in theorem [ thm : four ] satisfy the necessary condition @xmath32 for the existence of contact structures",
    ". it may be possible to obtain similar information for fibered type  @xmath0-manifolds which admit sasakian or einstein metrics by using the work of boyer and galicki @xcite .    the surgery exact sequence of wall @xcite provides a way to classify manifolds within a given ( simple ) homotopy type .",
    "however , in the application to concrete problems , one often faces homotopy theoretical difficulties . in our situation ,",
    "the setting of the problems is appropriate for the application of the modified surgery methods developed by kreck @xcite .",
