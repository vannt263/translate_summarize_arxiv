    "wormholes are exotic objects predicted by einstein s theory of gravity which acts as a space - time tunnel by connecting two different regions of the universe",
    ". thought , the idea of wormholes is not new @xcite , the interest on wormholes was recently reborn by the seminal work of morris and thorne @xcite who studied the traversable wormholes .",
    "there are , however , several problematic issues related to the possible existence of wormholes , in particular , it was shown that the existence of wormholes requires the violation of energy conditions @xcite .",
    "another major problem is related to the stability analysis of wormholes . on the other hand ,",
    "visser attempted to minimize the existence of the exotic matter by constructing infinitesimally small thin shell wormholes @xcite .",
    "the visser s method is based on the cut - and - paste technique by joining together two identical space - time solutions and making use of the dermis - israel formalism @xcite to compute the surface stress - energy tensor components .",
    "finally these results can be used to study the wormhole dynamics with the help of lanczos equations .",
    "this method was applied to construct a number of thinshell wormholes , including charged thin shell wormholes @xcite , tsw with a cosmological constant @xcite , tsw in dilaton gravity @xcite , tsw from the regular hayward black hole @xcite , tsw in higher dimensiaonal einstein - maxwell theory @xcite , rotating thin - shell wormhole @xcite , quantum corrected tsw in bohmian quantum mechanics @xcite , primordial wormholes induced from guts @xcite and many others @xcite . while the stability analyses is investigated by different models , for example , linear perturbations @xcite and specific equations of state ( eos ) such as : linear barotropic gas ( lbg ) , chaplygin gas ( cg ) , and logarithmic gas ( logg ) for the exotic matter @xcite .",
    "recently goulart found a four - dimensional , spherically symmetric , dyonic black hole solution in the low - energy effective actions of string theory or supergravity theory @xcite .",
    "this solution is of particular interest since it can be written in terms of five independent parameters : the electric charge @xmath0 , the magnetic charge @xmath1 , the value of the dilation of infinity @xmath3 , and two integration constants , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . inspired by this work , we aim to use this solution and construct a four - dimensional tsw wormhole and investigate at the same time the role of electric charge @xmath0 , magnetic charge @xmath1 , and dilaton charge @xmath3 on the stability domain of the wormhole .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .  in section",
    "ii , we briefly review and give the dyonic black hole solutions . in section iii , by using the visser s cut and paste technique we construct dyonic thin - shell wormhole . in section",
    "iv we check the stability conditions for different types of gases such as linear barotropic gas ( lbg ) , chaplygin gas ( cg ) , and logarithmic gas ( logg ) for the exotic matter . in section",
    "v we comment on our results .",
    "in this part we use the dyonic black hole solutions in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) theory which is given by goulart @xcite .",
    "firstly , we consider the action of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton without a dilaton potential and without an axion @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the newton constant and the field strength is given by @xmath8 furthermore , for constant axion field the bosonic sector of @xmath9 version of @xmath10 supergravity theory is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is noted that there are five independent parameters such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , the spacetime of the general spherically symmetric solution is given by the line element @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 with @xmath16 note that the corresponding electric and magnetic charges are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 stands for the value of the dilaton at infinity .",
    "furthermore there are two integration constants such as @xmath17 and @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are dependent constants inasmuch as they transform into each other under s - duality , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath22 , which is the the dilaton coupling , is also invariant .",
    "for the exremal limit , we choose their signs to be same to avoid negative entropies and without loss of generality it is taken as @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath13 are the inner and outer horizons respectively @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature is calculated by following @xmath24 and the entropy of the black hole is @xmath25 one can also define the dilaton charge as follows @xmath26 depeding on the values of electric / magnetic charge of black hole , it can be positive or negative .",
    "firstly , the four parameters ( @xmath27 , m ) dyonic solution is found in @xcite . here the key point is that there is no boundary condition on the @xmath17 and @xmath13 to make this dyonic black hole .",
    "the ricci scalar is calculated as follows @xmath28 the domain of the @xmath29 is restricted with the causality .",
    "the singularity is found at @xmath30 for @xmath31 , or at @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "one of the special case which we use to construct thin - shell wormhole is @xmath34 that the dilaton charge is a constant @xmath18 such as @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore we suppose that @xmath36 and ( @xmath37)= @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the solution becomes @xmath39 one can find the magnetically charged solutions of @xcite and @xcite by using @xmath40 and also the schwarzschild solution by setting that @xmath41 .",
    "let us now proceed to use cut and paste technique to construct a dtsw using the metric ( 3 ) .",
    "starting with two identical copies of the spacetime region @xmath42 where @xmath43 is choosen to be grater than the event horizon @xmath44 .",
    "next , paste the above regions at the boundary hypersurface @xmath45 which results with a geodesically complete manifold @xmath46 . according to the darmois ",
    "israel formalism we can choose the coordinates on @xmath47 as @xmath48 , while the coordinates on the induced metric @xmath49 are @xmath50 .",
    "for the parametric equation on @xmath49 we can write @xmath51    our main goal is to compare various characteristics of emd theory and dyonic black hole , such as the surface stress - energy tensor and the basic question of stability . for this purpose",
    "we define the dynamical induced metric on @xmath49 can now be writen in terms of the the proper time @xmath52 on the shell , where @xmath53 , as follows @xmath54    the junction conditions on @xmath49 implies from the lanczos equations @xmath55-{\\delta^{i}}_{j}\\,k\\right),\\ ] ] in which @xmath56 is the energy momentum tensor on the thin - shell , @xmath57 and @xmath58 $ ] , are defined as @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath58={k_{ij}}^{+}-{k_{ij}}^{-}$ ] , respectively .",
    "furthermore the extrinsic curvature @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61    we can choose the unit vectors @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 and normal to @xmath64 as follows @xmath65    adopting the orthonormal basis @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68^{-1/2}e_{\\theta}$ ] , @xmath69^{-1/2}e_{\\varphi}$ ] ) , for the metric ( 3 ) , the extrinsic curvature components are found as @xcite @xmath70 and @xmath71 where the prime and the dot represent the derivatives with respect to @xmath72 and @xmath52 , respectively . with the definitions of @xmath73\\equiv k_{_{\\hat{\\imath}\\hat{\\jmath}}}^{+}-k_{_{\\hat{\\imath}\\hat{\\jmath}}}^{-}$ ] , and @xmath74=[k_{\\;\\hat{\\imath}}^{\\hat{\\imath}}]$ ] , and the introduction of the surface stress - energy tensor",

    "we see that the surface density is negative , i.e. @xmath87 , as a consequence of this , the ( wec ) is violeted .",

    "the obove intergal can be easily evaluated if we first make use of the dirac delta function @xmath92    substituting the value of energy density in the last equation , for the energy density located on a thin shell surface in static configuration we find @xmath93    to analyze the attractive and repulsive nature of the wormhole we can calculate the the observes four - acceleration @xmath94 , where the four velocity reads @xmath95 . for the radial component of the acceleration we find @xmath96    one can easily observe that the test particle obeys the equation of motion @xmath97    we conclude from the last equation that if @xmath98 , we get the geodesic equation , while the wormhole is attractive when @xmath99 and repulsive when a @xmath100 .",
    "in this section , using the formalism developed in the section ( iii ) , we calculate the potential and define the stability method for thin - shell wormholes . from the energy conservation we have @xcite @xmath101^{2}-2h(a)h''(a)\\right\\rbrace \\frac{\\dot{a}\\sqrt{f(a)+\\dot{a}^{2}}}{2h(a)},\\label{34}\\ ] ] where the area of the wormhole is calculated by @xmath102 . it is noted that the internal energy of the throat is located at the left side of eq . as a first term .",
    "then the second term represents the work done by the internal forces of the throat , on the other hand there is a flux term in the right side of the equation .",
