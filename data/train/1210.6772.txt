    "in relativistic quantum field theory , the particle content of a quantum state is affected by the evolution of the spacetime , including the motion of any boundaries .",
    "further , the very notion of a `` particle '' depends on the motion of an observer . in flat spacetime , celebrated examples are the thermality seen in minkowski vacuum by uniformly accelerated observers , known as the unruh effect  @xcite , and the creation of particles by moving boundaries , known as the dynamical ( or non - stationary ) casimir effect ( dce )  @xcite . in curved spacetime ,",
    "a celebrated example is the hawking radiation emitted by black holes  @xcite .",
    "the dce is related to a fundamental prediction by fulling and davies that a non - uniformly accelerated mirror will excite photons out of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "it was later realised that this effect may be significantly enhanced if , instead of a simple mirror , a cavity is used in which one or both of the mirrors are in motion @xcite . the simplest situation in which to observe the dce is that of a cavity oscillating sinusoidally with frequency  @xmath0 .",
    "the dce is predicted to exhibit a fundamental resonance condition for the production of quantum entangled photon - pairs , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the two entangled photon frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the actual number of photons predicted for a mechanically oscillating cavity is strongly limited ( @xmath3 photons / second ) by the maximum achievable  @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason a number of alternative systems that also exhibit a periodically varying boundary of some kind have been proposed with the aim of enhancing the dce .",
    "examples are superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) mirrors , bose - einstein condensates ( producing phonon pairs ) and cavities controlled using nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding recent breakthroughs , the dce remains an extremely difficult effect to observe and study experimentally .",
    "in this paper we consider the general case of a rigid cavity undergoing an arbitrary ( mechanically induced ) acceleration . in the specific cases of a linear sinusoidal or a uniform circular motion ,",
    "we show that a mode mixing resonance condition , @xmath4  @xcite , for which no photons are generated , can be brought significantly below the dce photon generation resonance condition , to apparently experimentally accessible frequencies .",
    "we show how this low - frequency resonance leads to the generation of entanglement between existing and previously non - entangled cavity modes .",
    "the oscillating cavity can be shown to behave like a generalised beam - splitter , thus performing an essential quantum gate functionality .",
    "this demonstrates that relativistic effects , in this case non - uniform relativistic acceleration , can be exploited for quantum information .",
    "there are many proposals to generate gates in non - relativistic quantum information .",
    "our scheme pioneers on how to implement quantum gates in relativistic quantum information .",
    "we then discuss the possibility of performing actual experiments with mechanically oscillating optical cavities .",
    "we first consider the simplified case of a cavity in @xmath5-dimensional minkowski spacetime . the cavity is assumed mechanically rigid , maintaintaining constant length @xmath6 in its instantaneous rest frame .",
    "the proper acceleration at the centre of the cavity is denoted by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the proper time . to maintain rigidity ,",
    "the acceleration must be bounded by @xmath9  @xcite . from now on we set @xmath10 .",
    "the cavity contains a real scalar field @xmath11 of mass @xmath12 , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that the cavity is initially inertial , and we denote by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , a standard basis of cavity field modes that are of positive frequency @xmath15 with respect to the cavity s proper time before the acceleration .",
    "we also assume that the cavity s final state is inertial , and we denote by @xmath16 , @xmath14 , a standard basis of cavity field modes that are of positive frequency @xmath17 with respect to the cavity s proper time after the acceleration . because of the acceleration at intermediate times , the two sets of modes need not coincide , but the completeness of each set allows the sets to be related by the bogoliubov transformation @xcite @xmath18 where the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficient matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined by solving the field equation in the cavity during the acceleration .    in the initial and final inertial regions the field operator @xmath11 has the respective expansions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where the nonvanishing commutators of the early ( respectively late ) time creation and annihilation operators are @xmath23 = \\delta_{nm}$ ] @xmath24 = \\delta_{nm}\\bigr)$ ] . the early and late time creation and annihilation operators need not coincide , but it follows from that they can be expressed in terms of each other in terms of the bogoliubov coefficients  @xcite",
    ". in particular , the transformation mixes creation and annihilation operators if and only if some of the @xmath20-coefficients are nonvanishing .",
    "now , working in the heisenberg picture , the quantum state of the field in the cavity does not change in time .",
    "howevever , given a state  @xmath25 , we interpret its particle content at early times in terms of the early time vacuum  @xmath26 , which satisfies @xmath27 , and the early time excitations created by  @xmath28 . at late times , we similarly interpret the particle content of @xmath25 in terms of the late time vacuum  @xmath29 , which satisfies @xmath30 , and the late time excitations created by  @xmath31 .",
    "the acceleration hence affects the particle content of the cavity whenever the bogoliubov transformation differs from the identity transformation .",
    "the @xmath20-coefficients are responsible for creation and annihilation of particles , while the @xmath19-coefficients are responsible for mode mixing . in particular , the vacua @xmath26 and @xmath29 coincide if and only if all the @xmath20-coefficients vanish  @xcite",
    ".      we shall express the bogoliubov coefficients as a time - ordered integral , allowing both the magnitude and the time - dependence of the acceleration to remain general within the rigidity bound @xmath32 .",
    "we encode @xmath19 and @xmath20 into the matrix @xmath33 , so that the composition of bogoliubov transformations amounts to matrix multiplication of the corresponding @xmath34-matrices .",
    "the bogoliubov identities @xcite are then encoded in the matrix equation @xmath35 .",
    "when the acceleration between the initial and final inertial regions is uniform and lasts for proper time  @xmath36 , we have @xcite @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the angular frequencies during the acceleration , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the bogoliubov coefficient matrices from the initial inertial segment to the uniformly accelerated segment , and the acceleration has been encoded in the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the field modes and the angular frequencies during the acceleration have elementary expressions for @xmath45 and are given in terms of modified bessel functions for @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficients encoded in @xmath42 and @xmath43 do not have elementary expressions , but they can be written as integrals involving the inertial and accelerated mode functions over the constant time surface where the acceleration begins .    for accelerations that may vary arbitrarily between the initial time @xmath47 and final time  @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath48 is given by the limit of @xmath49 as @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 is fixed and each @xmath52 .",
    "as an infinitesimal increase in @xmath8 amounts to multiplying @xmath48 from the left by @xmath53 with infinitesimal  @xmath36 , @xmath48 satisfies the differential equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and the overdot denotes derivative with respect to  @xmath8 .",
    "the solution is @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the moment at which the acceleration ends and @xmath59 denotes the time - ordered exponential .    to summarise : the bogoliubov transformation between the inertial initial segment ending at proper time @xmath47 and the final inertial segment starting at proper time @xmath58 is given by  .",
    "@xmath60  may vary arbitrarily for @xmath61 , within the rigidity constraint @xmath62 : in particular , no small acceleration approximation has been made .",
    "for piecewise constant  @xmath60 , reduces to a product of the matrices @xmath63 from each constant @xmath64 segment .",
    "a direct consequence of is that the bogoliubov coefficients evolve by pure phases over any time interval in which @xmath64 is constant .",
    "particles in the cavity are hence created by _",
    "changes _ in the acceleration , not by acceleration itself , as can be argued on general adiabaticity grounds @xcite .",
    "the cavity is in this respect similar to a single accelerating mirror , which excites photons from the vacuum only when its acceleration is non - uniform  @xcite .      at small accelerations , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "have the expansions @xcite    [ eq : omega - ab - expansion ] @xmath65    where    [ eq : dirichlet - bogocoeffs - linear ] @xmath66 { { \\hat\\beta}}_{mn } & = \\frac{\\pi^2 m n \\bigl(1 - { ( -1)}^{m+n}\\bigr ) }   { l^4\\left(\\omega_m + \\omega_n\\right)^3 \\sqrt{\\omega_m \\omega_n } } \\ .   \\ ] ]    note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 depend on @xmath69 and @xmath6 only via the dimensionless quantity  @xmath70 .",
    "formulas are obtained from equations ( 7 ) in @xcite by an elementary rearrangement .",
    "we seek @xmath71 in the form    [ eq : ahatbhat - defs ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are of first order in  @xmath64 , and @xmath58 again denotes the moment at which the acceleration ends .",
    "using , and  , we find    [ eq : abhat - int - components ] @xmath76    to linear order in  @xmath64 , the bogoliubov coefficients are hence obtained by just fourier transforming the acceleration .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , while the perturbative solution assumes the acceleration to be so small that @xmath77 , the velocities , travel times and travel distances remain unrestricted , and the solution remains valid even when the velocities are relativistic .",
    "our perturbative treatment is hence complementary to the small distance approximations often considered in the dce literature  @xcite , while of course overlapping in the common domain of validity .",
    "second , @xmath78 and @xmath79 scale linearly in  @xmath64 , but their magnitudes depend also crucially on whether @xmath64 changes slowly or rapidly compared with the oscillating integral kernels in  . in the limit of slowly - varying @xmath64",
    "both @xmath78 and @xmath79 vanish , in agreement with the adiabaticity arguments of @xcite . in the limit of piecewise",
    "constant  @xmath64 , the changes in the magnitudes of @xmath78 and @xmath79 come entirely from the discontinuous jumps in @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the limit of piecewise constant @xmath64 may be difficult to realise experimentally with a material cavity , and we emphasise that no such rapid changes in the acceleration are involved in the experimental scenario considered in section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "this limit can however be simulated by a cavity whose walls are mechanically static dc squids undergoing electric modulation  @xcite .",
    "suppose now that @xmath77 , so that the solution  is valid .",
    "suppose that @xmath64 is sinusoidal with angular frequency  @xmath0 .",
    "for generic values of @xmath0 the integrals in are oscillatory and have no net growth as @xmath58 increases . however",
    ", when @xmath0 equals the angular frequency of an oscillating integral kernel in  , there is a resonance and the corresponding bogoliubov coefficient grows linearly in  @xmath58 .",
    "these resonance conditions read    @xmath80    where in each case @xmath81 needs to be odd in order for the coefficient to be nonvanishing .",
    "the particle creation resonance is well known in the dce literature  @xcite .",
    "the mode mixing resonance has been noted @xcite but seems to have received attention mainly in situations where it happens to coincide with a particle creation resonance . as the case of interest in the experimental scenario of section [ sec : experiment ] will be mode mixing without significant particle creation , we recall here some relevant properties of mode mixing in quantum optics .",
    "mode mixing without particle creation is known in quantum optics as a passive transformation  @xcite , implemented experimentally by passive optical elements such as beam splitters and phase plates .",
    "while mode mixing is present already in classical wave optics , its significance in quantum optics is that the mixing can be harnessed to quantum information tasks .",
    "the entangling power of passive transformations is well understood : for example , the mixing generates entanglement from an initial gaussian state only if this state is squeezed  @xcite .",
    "these entanglement considerations are directly applicable to mode mixing in our cavity , and the entanglement can be determined experimentally by measurements on quanta that are allowed to escape from the cavity  @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that while the particle creation resonance can be used to implement two - mode squeezing gates @xcite and other multipartite gates  @xcite , the mode - mixing resonance can be used to implement mode - mixing gates even when no particle creation is present .",
    "specifically , the oscillating cavity can be tuned to act as a beam splitter  a well - studied quantum gate in continuous variable systems  @xcite . in the following",
    "we apply our results to the special class of gaussian states , characterized by positive wigner functions , which allow elegant and powerful analytical results  @xcite .",
    "gaussian states , including coherent and squeezed states , are routinely prepared in the laboratory .",
    "for example , two - mode squeezed states are commonly produced by parametric down conversion  @xcite .    in order to calculate the entanglement generated by the mode mixing gate we have introduced , we adopt the covariance matrix formalism .",
    "we consider a family of harmonic oscillators with position and momentum operators @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "we collect these operators in the vector @xmath84 .",
    "the canonical commutation relations take the form @xmath85=i\\omega_{ij}$ ] , where the only nonvanishing components of the symplectic form @xmath86 are @xmath87 .",
    "the covariance matrix is defined by @xmath88 this formalism is suitable for gaussian states since all the relevant information about the state can be encoded in the first moment @xmath89 and the covariance matrix .",
    "in fact , the quantification of gaussian state entanglement requires only its covariance matrix  @xcite .",
    "an initial pure state remains pure to first order in the acceleration  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the reduced state @xmath90 of two modes will depend only on the bogoliubov coefficients that mix these two modes .",
    "the contribution of coefficients mixing with other frequencies is negligible to linear order in the acceleration .",
    "from now on we specialise to two - mode gaussian states for which @xmath90 is symmetric . in the covariance matrix formalism , the entanglement for such states is fully quantified by the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the covariance matrix  @xcite .",
    "the partial transpose is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , and its symplectic eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of @xmath93 .",
    "the eigenvalue set has the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and therefore the quantity characterising the entanglement is  @xmath96 . within our perturbative small acceleration expansion , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is linear in the acceleration .    while the von neumann entropy would be a natural measure of entanglement for the reduced two mode state  @xmath90 when the initial state is pure",
    ", its small acceleration expansion does not take the form of a power series because of the logarithms involved in its definition  @xcite .",
    "measures of entanglement based on the partial transpose criterion however do have a power series expansion in the acceleration .",
    "we consider the negativity  @xcite , which is in the covariance matrix formalism given by @xmath99 @xcite , and which hence has the small acceleration expansion @xmath100 .",
    "suppose now that the state is a separable state of two modes , @xmath101 and  @xmath102 , in which each mode is squeezed with the same squeezing parameter @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath79 is negligible compared with  @xmath78 , it follows from the expression of @xmath98 given in @xcite that the leading order contribution to the negativity is linear in the acceleration and given by @xmath104    the negativity @xmath105 as a function of the cavity oscillation angular frequency @xmath0 and the total oscillation time @xmath106 , for fixed @xmath107 and squeezing parameter  @xmath108 . ]    figure [ fig : alpharesneg ] shows a plot of the negativity as a function of the total oscillation time @xmath106 and the acceleration angular frequency  @xmath0 , assuming purely sinusoidal acceleration with phase chosen so that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath109 , for fixed @xmath107 and squeezing parameter  @xmath108 .",
    "the linear growth of @xmath105 at the resonance , @xmath110 , is evident from the plot .",
    "the scale of the vertical axis depends on @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath108 but also on  @xmath111 , in a way that we shall address in section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "let now @xmath11 be a real scalar field of mass @xmath113 in a cavity in @xmath112-dimensional minkowski space , with dirichlet conditions .",
    "the inertial cavity is a rectangular parallelepiped with fixed edge lengths @xmath114 , @xmath115 and  @xmath116 , and a standard basis of orthonormal field modes is indexed by triples @xmath117 of positive integers , such that the angular frequencies are @xmath118 .",
    "acceleration in the cavity s three principal directions can be treated as @xmath5-dimensional , with the inert transverse quantum numbers just contributing to the effective mass .",
    "acceleration of unrestricted magnitude and direction would require new input regarding how the shape of the cavity responds to such acceleration  @xcite .",
    "to _ linear _ order in the acceleration , however , boosts commute , and we can treat acceleration as a vector superposition of accelerations in the three principal directions in the cavity s instantaneous rest frame . defining @xmath74 and @xmath75 as in  , and denoting the acceleration three - vector in the cavity s instantaneous rest frame by @xmath119 , equations generalise for changes in the quantum number @xmath101 to    [ eq:3 + 1abhat - int - components ] @xmath120 { { \\hat b}}_{mnp , m'np } & = i   \\frac{\\pi^2 m m ' \\bigl(1 - { ( -1)}^{m+m'}\\bigr ) }   { l_x^3\\left(\\omega_{mnp } + \\omega_{m'np}\\right)^2 \\sqrt{\\omega_{mnp } \\omega_{m'np } } } \\int_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau_f } e^{-i(\\omega_{mnp } + \\omega_{m'np } ) ( \\tau-\\tau_0 ) } \\ , a_x(\\tau ) \\ , d\\tau   \\ ,   \\label{eq:3 + 1bhat - int - components}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with changes in the quantum numbers @xmath102 and @xmath121 given by similar formulas involving respectively @xmath122 and  @xmath123 .    for sinusoidal acceleration with angular frequency  @xmath0 , the resonance condition of linear growth is    [ eq:3 + 1resonance ] @xmath124    where in each case only the quantum number in the direction of the oscillation may differ and this difference needs to be odd .",
    "the particle creation resonance angular frequency is always larger than than the frequencies of the individual cavity modes .",
    "the mode mixing resonance angular frequency can however be lower . in @xmath5 dimensions ,",
    "mode mixing resonances occur significantly below the frequencies of the individual cavity modes if @xmath125 , as then @xmath126 whenever @xmath102 and @xmath127 are small compared with  @xmath70 . in more than @xmath5 dimensions , a similar lowering can be arranged to occur even for a massless field by storing in the cavity quanta whose wave vector is highly transverse to the acceleration , as the transverse momentum then gives rise to a large effective @xmath5-dimensional mass .",
    "we now outline a @xmath112-dimensional experimental scenario that optimises this lowering of the mode mixing resonance .    setting @xmath128",
    ", we assume that the quanta in the cavity have wavelength @xmath129 and have their momenta aligned close to the @xmath130-direction , so that @xmath131 and @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "we let the cavity undergo linear or circular harmonic oscillation orthogonal to the @xmath130-direction , with amplitude @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) in the @xmath135-direction ( @xmath136-direction ) . for motion in the @xmath135-direction , the mode mixing resonance angular frequency between modes @xmath101 and  @xmath137 , with @xmath138 odd , is @xmath139 and it follows from that the mode mixing growth rate is @xmath140 the lowest resonance occurs for @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "similar formulas ensue for the @xmath136-resonance , and for circular motion both resonances are present .",
    "as the experimental setup , we first trap one or more quanta in the cavity , in modes whose momenta are aligned close to the @xmath130-direction . after a period of linear or circular oscillation perpendicular to the @xmath130-direction , a measurement on the quantum state of the cavity is performed , by suitable observations of quanta that are allowed to escape .",
    "we assume that the resonance mode mixing dominates any effects due to the initial trapping and the final releasing of the quanta .",
    "a careful choice of the cavity geometry would need to be considered in order to guarantee the success of an experiment .",
    "a  particular concern would be the mechanical stability of the cavity itself .",
    "there are options for creating mechanically very robust cavities based on a monolithic geometry .",
    "examples could be a bragg grating cavity in an optical fibre .",
    "these are mechanically very robust and are a very well developed technology .",
    "another example , closer to the parameters specified below , would be a monolithic fabry - perot cavity or etalon filter cavity .",
    "such cavities can be made with extremely high finesse and are made out of a single solid block of material and hence inherit the robustness of the material itself ( typically , glass ) .",
    "we choose @xmath143 nm and @xmath144 cm .",
    "the lowest resonance angular frequency is then @xmath145 , corresponding to an oscillation frequency @xmath146mhz .    for linear oscillation",
    ", we choose the amplitude @xmath147 m , which may be achievable by using ultrasound to accelerate the cavity . from we",
    "then have @xmath148 , so that the mode mixing coefficient grows to order unity within a millisecond . for the squeezed states of section  [ subsec : resonances ]",
    ", the negativity grows to order unity at the same timescale provided the squeezing parameter @xmath108 is not much less than unity . storing the quantum in the cavity for a millisecond could be challenging although recent achievements indicate that it may be feasible  @xcite .    for circular motion ,",
    "we choose the amplitude @xmath149 mm . at the threshold angular velocity @xmath150rpm",
    ", the mode mixing coefficient then grows to order unity within a nanosecond , and for squeezed states similarly for the negativity provided the squeezing parameter @xmath108 is not much less than unity .",
    "the threshold angular velocity exceeds the angular velocity of medical ultracentrifuges by a factor of 200  @xcite , but this gap could possibly be bridged by a specifically designed system of sub - centimetre scale .",
    "we note that the centripetal acceleration at the threshold angular velocity equals @xmath151 , which is already reached in ultracentrifuges that combine a smaller angular velocity with a larger radius  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath0 in these scenarios is much below the particle creation resonance  , particle creation in the cavity is not cumulative in the duration of the oscillation and is highly sensitive to the manner in which the acceleration is switched on and off .",
    "while this is a consequence of the idealised , fully confining character of our cavity , we may obtain an upper limit for the predicted particle creation by noting that in the extreme case of sharp switch - on and switch - off @xmath152 has the order of magnitude @xmath153 the number of particles created in a mode with fixed @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath121 , each near their lowest value @xmath154 , can hence be given an upper bound by summing the square of over  @xmath137 .",
    "the result is a purely numerical factor times @xmath155 , which is of order @xmath156 for our linear oscillation figures and of order @xmath157 for our circular motion figures . at the mode mixing resonance ,",
    "the mixing hence overwhelmingly dominates over any particle creation effects .",
    "this is consistent with the usual estimates of @xmath158 photons created per second @xcite for experimentally less idealised cavities .",
    "we have quantised a scalar field in a rectangular cavity that is accelerated arbitrarily in @xmath112-dimensional minkowski spacetime , in the limit of small accelerations but arbitrary velocities and travel times .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients were expressed as explicit quadratures . for linear or circular periodic motions , we identified a configuration in which the mode mixing resonance frequency is significantly below the frequencies of the cavity modes .",
    "our scalar field analysis adapts in a straightforward way to a maxwell field with perfect conductor boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the mode mixing effects appear hence to be within the reach of a desktop experiment with photons , achievable with current technology in its mechanical aspects , if perhaps not yet in the storage capabilities required of a mechanically oscillating optical cavity .",
    "we anticipate that the particle creation and mode mixing effects are not qualitatively sensitive to the detailed shape of the cavity , and this freedom could be utilised in the development of a concrete laboratory implementation . the experimental prospects could be further improved by filling the cavity with a medium that slows light down  @xcite .",
    "a  laboratory implementation would also need to develop an experimental protocol for measuring the field within the cavity , and the data analysis would need to account for any experimental imperfections . a  full detailed evaluation of these experimental issues would need to be carried out case by case for any proposed concrete implementation , but the frequency and lifetime estimates given in this paper do suggest the mode mixing effect to be at the threshold of current technology .",
    "we underline that our experimental scenario does not involve significant particle creation .",
    "nevertheless , it involves significant mode mixing .",
    "this mixing acts as a beam splitter quantum gate , creating or degrading entanglement in situations where particles are initially present .",
    "finally , it is also worth underlining that although we have discussed the specific case of a mechanically oscillating cavity , the low - frequency resonance can be found whenever the quanta can be made highly transverse to the acceleration , and may therefore be similarly adopted to perform quantum gate operations also in other analogue systems , based e.g.  on squid mirrors @xcite or nonlinear optics @xcite that have been proposed to date .",
    "we anticipate that observations of entanglement will generally provide opportunities for experimental verification of both particle creation and mode mixing effects that are complementary to observations of fluxes or particle numbers  @xcite .",
