    "in distributed control systems , sensors , actuators and control unit may be placed at locations which are geographically separated .",

    "+ the problem addressed in this paper is to control a plant so as to have its output tracking ( a family of ) reference commands generated at a _ remote location _ and transmitted through a communication channel of finite capacity .",
    "what renders the problem in question different from a conventional tracking problem is that the _ tracking error _ , that is the difference between the command input and the controlled output , is not available as a _ physical entity _ , as it is defined as difference between two quantities residing at different ( and possibly distant ) physical locations .",
    "therefore the tracking error as such can not be used to drive a feedback controller , as it is the case in a standard tracking problem .",
    "+ the actual tracking error not being available , it is natural to approach the problem by reconstructing the tracking error starting from the information transmitted through the communication channel .",
    "for the reconstruction to successfully take place , the information must be suitably encoded .",
    "a possibility is to make use of a sufficiently large number of bits , so as to render the magnitude of the difference between the true reference signal and the reconstructed one negligible .",
    "however , in the framework of distributed control systems , the constraint on the available bandwidth is usually tight and adopting encoding schemes which require a large number of bits may not be practically feasible .",
    "the approach pursued in this paper is rather to counteract the uncertainty due to the presence of the communication channel by a suitable choice of the parameters of the regulator . + in section 2",
    ", the formulation of the problem is made more precise , whereas the procedure for encoding the reference command is described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 introduces the regulator which guarantees the achievement of the control goal using the reconstructed tracking error .",
    "the main results of the paper are stated and proved in section 5 .",
    "the proof consists of two steps .",
    "first , boundedness of the closed - loop trajectories are shown ( section 5.1 ) , and then asymptotic convergence to zero of the tracking error is concluded ( section 5.2 ) .",
    "the results are illustrated by an example in section 6 .",
    "generally speaking , the problem in question can be defined in the following terms . consider a single - input single - output nonlinear system modeled by equations of the form and suppose its output @xmath3 is required to asymptotically track the output @xmath4 of a remotely located exosystem    the problem is to design a control law of the form in which @xmath5 represents a _ sampled and quantized _ version of the remote exogenous input @xmath6 , so as to have the tracking error asymptotically converging to zero as time tends to @xmath7 .",
    "note that the controller in question does not have access to @xmath8 , which is not physically available , but only to the controlled output and to a sampled and quantized version of the remotely generated command .",
    "we will show in what follows how the theory of output tracking can be enhanced so as to address this interesting design problem .",
    "in particular , we will show how , by incorporating in the controller two ( appropriate ) internal models of the exogenous signals , the desired control goal can be achieved .",
    "one internal model is meant to asymptotically reproduce , at the location of the controlled plant , the behavior of the remote command input .",
    "the other internal model , as in any tracking scheme , is meant to generate the  feed - forward \" input which keeps the tracking error identically at zero .",
    "we begin by describing , in the following section , the role of the first internal model .",
    "in order to overcome the limitation due to the finite capacity of the communication channel , the control structure proposed here has a decentralized structure consisting of two separate units : one unit , co - located with the command generator , consists of an _ encoder _ which extracts from the reference signal the data which are transmitted through the communication channel ; the other unit , co - located with the controlled plant , consists of a _ decoder _ which processes the encoded received information and of a _ regulator _ which generates appropriate control input .",
    "the problem at issue will be solved under a number of assumptions most of which are inherited by the literature of output regulation and/or control under quantization .",
    "the first assumption , which is a customary condition in the problem of output regulation , is formulated as follows .    * ( a0 ) * the vector field @xmath9 in ( [ exogeneral ] ) is locally lipschitz and the initial conditions for ( [ exogeneral ] ) are taken in a fixed compact invariant set @xmath10.@xmath11    the next assumption is , on the contrary , newer and motivated by the specific problem addressed in this paper . in order to formulate rigorously the assumption in question , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "in particular let @xmath12 denote the distance at a point @xmath13 from a compact subset @xmath14 , i.e. the number @xmath15 and let    furthermore , having denoted by @xmath16 the number of bits characterizing the communication channel constraint , let @xmath17 be the largest positive integer such that where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , denotes the lowest integer such that @xmath20 .    with this notation in mind ,",
    "the second assumption can be precisely formulated as follows .    *",
    "( a1 ) * there exists a compact set @xmath21 which is invariant for @xmath22 and such that @xmath23    @xmath24 being compact and @xmath9 being locally lipschitz , it is readily seen that there exists a non decreasing and bounded function @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , such that for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 and for all @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the solutions of ( [ exogeneral ] ) at time @xmath32 passing through @xmath33 and , respectively , @xmath34 at time @xmath35 .",
    "this function , the sampling interval @xmath36 , the number @xmath37 defined in ( [ l0def ] ) and the number @xmath17 fulfilling ( [ nbnrel ] ) , determine the parameters of the encoder - decoder pair , which are defined as follows ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "_ encoder dynamics_. the encoder dynamics consist of a copy of the exosystem dynamics , whose state is updated at each sampling time @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and determines ( depending on the actual state of the exosystem ) the centroid of the quantization region , and of an additional discrete - time dynamics which determines the size of the quantization region .",
    "specifically , the encoder is characterized by @xmath40   l(k+1 ) & = & \\dst \\sqrt{r } \\ , { m(t ) \\over   n } l(k ) & \\qquad l(0 ) =   l_0   \\ea\\ ] ] in which @xmath5 represents the encoded information given by , for @xmath41 , @xmath42   \\dst \\left \\lceil \\dst { n|w_i(kt ) - w_{e , i}(kt^-)| \\over l(k ) } - \\dst   { 1 \\over 2 } \\right \\rceil & \\hspace{5 mm } n \\ ;   \\mbox{odd}\\ , .",

    "furthermore , it can be proved that the set @xmath24 characterized in assumption ( a1 ) is invariant for the encoder ( decoder ) dynamics and that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) converges uniformly to the true exosystem state @xmath49 , provided that @xmath36 is properly chosen with respect to the number @xmath17 and the function @xmath50 .",

    "as in most of the literature on regulation of nonlinear system , we assume in what follows that the controlled plant has well defined relative degree and normal form .",
