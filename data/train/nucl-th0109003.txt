    "at present , a very interesting topic in the field of medium energy physics is devoted to the role of effective degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) in hadronic systems in terms of nucleon , meson and isobar d.o.f . and their connection to the underlying quark - gluon dynamics of qcd .",
    "for the study of this basic question , the two - nucleon system provides an important test laboratory , because it is the simplest nuclear system for the study of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "moreover , the role of medium effects due to two - body operators and the role of offshell effects , i.e.  the change of single particle properties in the nuclear medium , can be investigated most precisely .",
    "state - of - the - art models for describing hadronic and electromagnetic reactions on the two - nucleon system up to the @xmath0 region should incorporate  among other things  a dynamical treatment of the @xmath0 isobar .",
    "moreover , gauge invariance and unitarity should be fulfilled at least approximately . within a unitary model ,",
    "the various possible reactions can not be treated independently , because they are linked by the optical theorem .",
    "for example , for energies up to the two - pion threshold the forward compton scattering amplitude is related via @xmath2 to the sum of the cross sections of photodisintegration and coherent and incoherent pionphotoproduction .",
    "therefore , all reactions on the two - nucleon system should be described within one consistent framework . in the past years , we have started to realize this ambitious project within a _ retarded _ coupled channel @xmath3-approach based on three - body scattering theory with nucleon , @xmath0 and meson degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in order to motivate why retardation should be taken into account above pion threshold , let us consider an arbitrary two - body meson - exchange operator like the ordinary one - pion exchange potential . in time - ordered perturbation theory ,",
    "the propagation of the intermediate @xmath4 system is described by the retarded propagator @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the invariant energy of the system and @xmath7 denotes the kinetic hamilton operator for the intermediate @xmath4 system . due to its nonhermiticity , nonlocality and the existence of singularities above pion threshold ,",
    "an exact treatment of @xmath8 is quite complicated .",
    "therefore , in most practical applications a low energy approximation , the so - called _ static limit _ is used by neglecting the energy transfer between the nucleons by the pion .",
    "the corresponding propagator @xmath9 is much easier to handle .",
    "one encounters on the other hand at least two serious problems . above pion - threshold",
    ", unitarity is violated due to the absence of singularities in @xmath9 . moreover , in the past it turned out that even the simplest photonuclear reaction , namely deuteron photodisintegration , can not be described even qualitatively within a consistent static framework @xcite .    for incorporating retardation , the mesons generating the nucleon - nucleon interacton and the meson - exchange currents have to be treated as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the model hilbert space consists then of three orthogonal subspaces @xmath10 } = { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\bar n } \\oplus { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\delta } \\oplus   { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{x}\\ , $ ] , where @xmath10}_{\\bar n}$ ] contains two bare nucleons , @xmath10}_{\\delta}$ ] one nucleon and one @xmath0 resonance , and @xmath10}_{x}$ ] two nucleons and one meson @xmath11 .",
    "concerning the hadronic part , the basic interactions in our model are @xmath12 and @xmath13 vertices . inserting these into the lippmann - schwinger equation , one obtains after some straightforward algebra @xcite effective hadronic interactions acting in @xmath10}_{\\bar n } \\oplus   { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\delta}$ ] which contain the desired _ retarded _ one - boson exchange ( obe ) mechanisms describing the transitions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this strategy of starting with vertices as basic interaction terms in the enlarged hilbert space @xmath10}$ ] has the advantage that no inconsistencies occur . in this context ,",
    "note especially that the vertices are hermitean . on the other hand ,",
    "if one started with a retarded obe as basic interaction in @xmath10}_{\\bar n } \\oplus   { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\delta}$ ] , one would loose hermiticity and therefore the solid grounds of quantum mechanics .    in our explicit realization ,",
    "we use for the parametrization of the retarded @xmath1 interaction the elster potential @xcite which takes into account in addition one - pion loop diagrams in order to fulfill unitarity above pion threshold .",
    "therefore , one has to distinguish between bare and physical nucleons ( see @xcite for details ) . concerning the transitions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we take besides retarded pion exchange static @xmath17 exchange into account .",
    "moreover , the interaction of two nucleons in the deuteron channel in presence of a spectator pion ( the so - called @xmath18 channel ) is also considered . by a suitable box renormalization @xcite , we are able to obtain approximate phase equivalence between the elster potential and our coupled channel approach below pion threshold .",
    "similarly , the basic electromagnetic interactions consist of baryonic and mesonic one - body currents as well as vertex and kroll - rudermann contributions @xcite .",
    "these currents are , together with the @xmath4 vertex , the basic building blocks of the corresponding effective current operators .",
    "the latter contain beside the ordinary spin- , convection- and spin - orbit current full retarded pionic meson exchange currents and electromagnetic loop contributions , where the latter can be interpreted as off - shell contributions to the baryonic one - body current @xcite .",
    "moreover , static @xmath17 mec as well as @xmath0 mec contributions are taken into account .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that concerning the pionic part gauge invariance is fulfilled in leading order of @xmath19 .",
    "the hadronic @xmath0 parameters and the m1 @xmath20 coupling are simultaneously fitted to the @xmath21 multipole of pion photoproduction on the nucleon , the @xmath22 channel in pion - nucleon scattering and the @xmath23 channel in nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ nnphase ] , our results for the @xmath23 phase shift and inelasticity are depicted .",
    "we obtain a good description at least up to about @xmath24 mev . concering the other partial @xmath1 waves ,",
    "the overall description is fairly well but needs some further improvement in the future @xcite .",
    "therefore , at present we are constructing from scratch an improved hadronic interaction model whose parameters are fitted to the phase shifts and inelasticities of _ all _ relevant @xmath1 scattering partial waves for @xmath25 energies up to about 1 gev .",
    "as next , we discuss very briefly deuteron photodisintegration .",
    "the starting point of our consideration is the static approach of wilhelm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which is based on the bonn - obepr potential @xcite .",
    "similar to our present approach , there is no free parameter in the calculation of the photodisintegration process in @xcite . as is evident form fig .",
    "[ fig_gd ] , wilhelm _ et al .",
    "_ clearly fail in describing the data .",
    "one obtains a considerable underestimation of the cross section in the @xmath0 peak .",
    "moreover , a dip structure around @xmath26 occurs at higher energies which is not present in the data . on the other hand ,",
    "these problems in the differential cross section vanish almost completely in a retarded approach @xcite",
    ". however , some discrepancies in polarization observables like the linear photon asymmetry @xmath27 or the polarization @xmath28 of the outgoing proton are still present , and which need further consideration @xcite .",
    "a very interesting topic to be studied in the future is the exploration of the spin asymmetry of the total cross section on the nucleon which determines the gdh - sum rule @xcite and which is at present under investigation experimentally @xcite . due to the lack of a free neutron target ,",
    "a measurement on the deuteron is of specific significance because it may serve as an effective neutron target .",
    "however , the extraction of the neutron contributions relies on the basic assumption that final state interactions and mec can be neglected and that proton and neutron contribute incoherently .",
    "first , still preliminary results show that these assumptions are quite crude . in the future ,",
    "we plan to apply the present model to other reactions , especially electrodisintegration .",
    "conceptually , we have to improve our hadronic interaction model .",
    "moreover , additional d.o.f . like the roper , the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 resonance should be taken into account if one wants to consider higher energies ."
