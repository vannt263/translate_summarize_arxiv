    "as the simplest element in nature , hydrogen has been investigated theoretically and experimentally from the very first beginnings of quantum theory .",
    "since hydrogen appears in three isotopic forms ( hydrogen , deuterium , and tritium ) , it offers even more interesting scientific investigation possibilities .",
    "the interest of the scientific community in the study of electron spin - polarized hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) and its isotopes , spin - polarized deuterium ( d@xmath0 ) and spin - polarized tritium ( t@xmath0 ) , began after kolos and wolniewicz ( kw ) calculated very precisely the triplet pair potential @xmath4@xmath5 in 1965.@xcite the enthusiasm for the study of electron spin - polarized hydrogen and its isotopes originated from the expectations to explore even more extreme quantum matter than helium isotopes.@xcite such expectations were grounded on the extremely weak attraction of the triplet pair potential @xmath4@xmath5 through which two h@xmath0 ( d@xmath0 or t@xmath0 ) atoms interact , and on their even lighter masses compared to helium isotopes .",
    "in addition , it was shown by freed @xcite in 1980 that , within the born - oppenheimer approximation in the spin - aligned electronic state , hydrogen nuclei behave as effective bosons , as well as tritium nuclei .",
    "stwalley and nosanow @xcite had proposed in 1976 h@xmath0 as the most promising candidate for achieving a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "this theoretical prediction was an important impulse for the experimentalists because production of cold samples always represented a huge experimental challenge .",
    "the extensive h@xmath0 study started in amsterdam in 1980 when silvera and walraven managed to stabilize a very dilute gas of spin - polarized hydrogen.@xcite a long experimental journey preceded the final realization of a bec state in h@xmath0 . in 1998 ,",
    "@xcite managed to form a bec state of h@xmath0 using an experimental setup with a wall - free confinement and a low evaporation rate .",
    "all spin - polarized hydrogen isotopes are usually a mixture of hyperfine states , which is important for confinement and stabilization of the system . in ref .",
    ", greytak _ et al .",
    "_ concluded that it is not possible to confine in a static magnetic trap the lowest two states , @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( high - field seeking states , fig . 1 in ref . ) , due to the impossibility of having a maximum in the magnitude of the magnetic field in a source - free region .",
    "thus , stable states have to be sought among the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states ( low - field seeking states , fig . 1 in ref . )",
    ", which in pure magnetic traps have a local minimum in the field . in the experiments described in ref .",
    ", the doubly polarized @xmath8 state was used , usually designated as h@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9 * , in which both electron and nuclear spins are polarized in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the second , crossed arrow , refers specifically to the nuclear spin .",
    "those very important experimental achievements were accompanied by new theoretical work .",
    "recently , the ground - state properties of h@xmath0 have been investigated using the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method.@xcite by means of accurate microscopic calculations it has been confirmed that h@xmath0 does not form a liquid phase at zero temperature , and in addition the gas - solid phase transition was also examined .",
    "the ground - state properties calculated with dmc are obtained using the triplet pair potential @xmath4@xmath5 , recently recalculated and extended to larger interparticle distances by jamieson _",
    "( jdw).@xcite the dmc results are in good agreement with the conclusions previously obtained with different variational methods by other authors@xcite concerning the gas phase of bulk h@xmath0 . in all of the theoretical studies ,",
    "hyperfine interaction has not been considered and no magnetic field has been included , so both h@xmath0 and h@xmath9 refer to the same system .",
    "nuclear spins are not explicitly labeled and different hyperfine states are degenerate in that approach .",
    "the same approach has been taken in all theoretical studies of bulk properties of other hydrogen isotopes as well .",
    "the ground - state properties of tritium t@xmath0 have also been microscopically studied . due to its larger mass and the fact that t@xmath0 atoms obey bose statistics ,",
    "it was predicted using variational theory that t@xmath0 forms a liquid at @xmath10=0 .",
    "@xcite those predictions have been recently confirmed using the dmc method,@xcite and the densities at which the liquid - solid phase transition occurs at @xmath10=0 have been also determined . as in the case of spin - polarized hydrogen,@xcite",
    "the dmc simulations used the jdw interatomic potential . on the other hand , blume _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed to t@xmath0 as a possible new bec gas in an optical dipole trap because of its very broad feshbach resonance , which can be used to tune the interaction potential .    from the experimental point of view , the exploration of d@xmath0 started almost simultaneously with h@xmath0 experiments.@xcite in the same group in which a very dilute gas of spin - polarized hydrogen was stabilized,@xcite d@xmath0 was also the subject of experimentation .",
    "contrary to the stabilization of h@xmath0 , it was not possible to achieve stable d@xmath0 due to its adsorption on the @xmath11he surface and its posterior recombination to form d@xmath12 .",
    "the maximum of the achieved d@xmath0 density in that experiment was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the one achieved for h@xmath0 . even though d@xmath0 was then not experimentally stabilized , a lot of theoretical work was dedicated to this remarkable quantum system .",
    "having in mind that d@xmath0 is a fermi system with nuclear spin 1 and given the fact that different d@xmath0 species are possible depending on how d@xmath0 atoms are distributed with respect to the available nuclear - spin states ( -1 ,  0 ,  + 1 ) , the ground - state properties of this exciting system were studied in the past.@xcite according to the best of our knowledge , microscopic dmc calculations for spin - polarized deuterium have not been performed yet , thus leaving the determination of the equation of state for d@xmath0 only at the variational level .",
    "previously , it was shown that when all three nuclear - spin states are equally occupied , d@xmath3 , the ground state is a liquid.@xcite the ground state of the system in which two nuclear - spin states are equally occupied , d@xmath2 , was studied by panoff and clark using variational monte carlo ( vmc).@xcite they used an improved wave function which included optimal jastrow , triplet , and backflow correlations .",
    "the negative energy per particle obtained at equilibrium density @xmath13 @xmath14 revealed that d@xmath2 also forms a self - bound liquid in the ground state .    from the theoretical side",
    ", special attention was dedicated to d@xmath1 because , as emphasized in ref . , it has the best chance of experimental realization due to its predicted gas nature .",
    "important theoretical results regarding the lifetime of magnetically trapped d@xmath0 gas were given in the works of koelman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the population dynamics of the hyperfine levels of atomic deuterium , presented in fig . 1 of ref . ,",
    "was investigated as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that a mixture of the low - field - seeking hyperfine @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 states , confined in a static minimum-_b_-field trap , will decay rapidly , due to spin exchange , towards the doubly polarized gas d@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9 * of only @xmath17-state atoms .",
    "it was also shown that d@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9 * stability should grow with decreasing temperature . in that way d@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9",
    "* was characterized as the most stable _ b_-field - trappable spin - polarized system . since in the theoretical studies of d@xmath1 magnetic field",
    "is not considered , the direction of the spins is not specified , so the obtained results refer to both d@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9 * and d@xmath0[line - through]*@xmath0*. however , after the results of koelman _ _ et al.__@xcite it became clear that d@xmath9[line - through]*@xmath9 * is the version of d@xmath1 ( ref . ) which is the most likely to be experimentally achieved . in 1995",
    "hayden and hardy studied extensively atomic hydrogen and deuterium mixtures confined by liquid - helium - coated - walls.@xcite the technique used in their experiments enabled obtaining the information about the two atomic densities simultaneously .",
    "in addition , recently , magnetic trapping of the low - field - seeking deuterium atoms after multistage zeeman deceleration was achieved,@xcite opening prospects for the experimental study of this system .",
    "the nature of the ground state of d@xmath1 was not fully resolved in ref . because of the obtained positive variational energy per particle , even when the refinements to the ground - state trial wave function were included in the description of the system .",
    "therefore , they could not predict with certainty the zero - temperature phase of d@xmath1 and concluded that d@xmath1 may remain in the gaseous state down to absolute zero , leaving open the possibility that d@xmath1 could liquefy under a very slight pressure .",
    "their results have been qualitatively confirmed recently by skjetne and stgaard with the silvera interaction potential.@xcite in our recent vmc study of bulk d@xmath1 we investigated the influence of the interaction potential on the d@xmath1 equation of state , and we discussed the liquid - gas coexistence region.@xcite our variational calculations showed that a gas - liquid transition occurs at extremely low density of the gas ( @xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath14 ) and very low pressure ( @xmath180.0008 bar ) .",
    "in the present work , we present results obtained using the diffusion monte carlo method for the three spin - polarized deuterium species , d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and d@xmath3 , at zero temperature .",
    "the sign problem due to their fermi statistics is treated within the fixed - node ( fn ) approximation .",
    "this approximation is one of the most accurate theoretical methods for the prediction of the ground - state properties of fermi systems , especially in cases in which the nodal surface of the trial wave function is very close to the exact one .",
    "interaction between d@xmath0 atoms is modeled using the newest jdw triplet pair potential @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "this interaction is then smoothly connected to the long - range behavior stated in ref . .",
    "in addition to the microscopic results of the energetic and structural properties of the d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and d@xmath3 bulk systems at @xmath10=0 , we comment also on the influence of the backflow correlations on the ground - state energy at the dmc level . the obtained equilibrium densities for d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 liquids are compared with those determined in previous approximate descriptions .",
    "the gas - liquid phase transition of d@xmath1 at @xmath10=0 is explored using the dmc method .    in sec .",
    "ii , the dmc method and the trial wave function used for importance sampling are briefly described .",
    "the results obtained for the three spin - polarized deuterium species , d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and d@xmath3 , including the equations of state as well as their structural properties , are presented in sec .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of this work are summarized in sec .",
    "the aim of the diffusion monte carlo method is to solve stochastically the schrdinger equation written in imaginary time , @xmath20 for an @xmath21-particle hamiltonian    @xmath22    the constant @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ schro ] ) acts as a reference energy , and @xmath24 is known as a _ walker _ , which collectively denotes the particle positions within the monte carlo methodology .",
    "introducing importance sampling , the schrdinger equation is rewritten in terms of the mixed distribution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a trial wave function . in the diffusion process ,",
    "the mixed distribution @xmath27 is represented by a set of _ walkers_. the lowest - energy eigenfunction , not orthogonal to @xmath26 , survives in the limit @xmath28 , and then the sampling of the ground state for an @xmath21-body bosonic system is effectively achieved .",
    "because of the sign problem which exists in the case of fermi systems , @xmath29 is not always positive . to satisfy the condition @xmath30",
    "one relies on the fixed - node approximation in which @xmath31 and @xmath26 have to change sign together , i.e. , share the same nodes . having this in mind",
    ", the fixed - node energy obtained in the @xmath28 limit is an upper bound to the exact ground - state energy .",
    "the trial wave function used in the present simulations is the jastrow - slater model @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the jastrow part of the trial wave function which describes the dynamical correlations induced by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the antisymmetric wave function which introduces the statistics of fermi particles .",
    "the schiff - verlet ( sv ) @xcite form @xmath36,\\ ] ] with variational parameter @xmath4 , is used to model the two - body correlations .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the trial wave function @xmath35 is modeled with a slater determinant in the case of d@xmath1 and the product of two and three slater determinants in the case of d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "single - particle plane - wave orbitals are used in the slater determinant , @xmath37 , which correspond to the exact wave function of the fermi sea .    as usual for bulk system simulations with a finite number of particles , a size - dependence analysis has to be performed .",
    "we added to our dmc results the standard tail corrections , i.e. , corrections coming from the finite size ( @xmath38 ) of the simulation box , @xmath39 assuming @xmath40 for @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "we also add the fermi correction for the ground - state energy of the system .",
    "the fermi correction is obtained as the difference between the ground - state energy per particle of a free fermi gas [ @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the spin degeneracy , and the result obtained by summing the discrete contributions of wave vectors ( @xmath45 ) used in our finite @xmath21-particle simulation .    as shown in ref .",
    ", it is enough to use 33 particles to simulate bulk d@xmath1 .",
    "the same values of the optimal variational parameter @xmath4 reported in ref .",
    "are used in the present diffusion monte carlo calculations of d@xmath1 for the investigated density range , from @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath14 . in the case of d@xmath2 and a density range from @xmath48 to @xmath47 @xmath14 ,",
    "the optimal value of parameter @xmath4 slightly increases from @xmath49 to @xmath50  .",
    "the detailed size - dependence analysis for d@xmath2 at density @xmath51 @xmath14 is given in table [ tab : sized2 ] .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : sized2 ] , the minimum value of the fermi correction is produced for the 66-particle system , and thus we decided to use this number of particles in our study .",
    ".energy per particle of d@xmath2 ( in k ) as a function of the number of atoms included in the simulation for the density @xmath51 @xmath14 .",

    "our dmc results show that the ground state of d@xmath3 is a liquid , even when backflow correlations are not incorporated in the trial wave function .",
    "panoff and clark@xcite reported negative vmc energies per particle for d@xmath3 in the case in which only the two - body correlations are used to model the trial wave function , indicating in that way that the ground state of the system is a liquid .",
    "we reproduced their vmc results using 57 atoms and the same variational parameter @xmath4 they used for the sv correlations , and we noticed that their conclusion about d@xmath3 ground state changes if the fermi correction is added to the vmc results . in the density range from @xmath48 to @xmath47 @xmath14 ,",
    "the fermi correction for @xmath53 atoms increases from 0.04 to 0.07 k. adding this correction to the vmc results , the energies become positive in the density range mentioned above , and one can not predict a liquid phase for d@xmath3 .    if we compare our dmc results in which the backflow correlations are absent with those in which the backflow correlations are included , it is clear that including the backflow correlations in the model shifts the equilibrium density to a slightly higher value [ from @xmath54 @xmath14 to @xmath55 @xmath14 ] and lowers the equilibrium energy [ from @xmath57 k to @xmath58 k ] , as it was already noticed for d@xmath2 .",

    "the energy ordering for the three d@xmath0 species , close to the equilibrium densities , was found to be @xmath68 due to the degeneracy , as was already pointed out in previous variational descriptions of the systems .",

    "spin - polarized atomic deuterium is a paradigmatic example of the relevance of quantum effects , mainly of the quantum statistics , on the nature of condensed matter at very low temperatures .",
    "the interatomic potential does not distinguish between the three d@xmath0 species because it is dominated by the electronic structure .",
    "however , the occupation of the nuclear spin states is able of producing different physical phases due to the relative weight of the fermi statistical correlations . when the pauli principle becomes more important , in the d@xmath1 case",
    ", the system is no longer a liquid at zero pressure as happens in d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 , but it is a gas .",
    "no such effect is observed in liquid @xmath71he in which the complete spin polarization does not change its liquid character .",
    "it could be that atomic deuterium is the only physical system in which this spin - degeneracy mechanism is able to modify zero - temperature phase diagrams .",
