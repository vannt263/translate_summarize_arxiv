    "improvement in experimental techniques in the last decades has led to the production and study of very light neutron rich nuclei up to and even beyond the neutron dripline .",
    "one of the very interesting phenomena in such nuclei is the neutron halo@xcite .",
    "the halo significantly affects different reactions involving these nuclei .    in an earlier work@xcite , we studied the structure of exotic even - even be and c nuclei and calculated the elastic proton scattering cross section using the theoretical densities . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the same procedure to he nuclei near the neutron drip line .",
    "these nuclei have only a few nucleons and show a very large neutron - proton ratio .",
    "study of such nuclei is important for the effect of their extreme isospin values on the nuclear interaction . besides the bound states in the even - even nuclei , low energy resonance states in odd mass he nuclei beyond the drip line have also been investigated .",
    "one of our main interest lies in the prediction for neutron radius and neutron density in he nuclei .",
    "neutron rich he nuclei are known to exhibit neutron halos .",
    "however , determination of the extent of the halo is ambiguous , as the information on density is model dependent in absence of direct measurements like electron scattering . for a nucleus with only a few nucleons , the bulk radius value , extracted from experiment",
    ", may also be model dependent .",
    "direct comparison with experimental measurements may yield better idea about the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "for example , calculation of differential cross section in elastic proton scattering in inverse kinematics is expected to provide a test for the calculated densities@xcite .",
    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach is now a standard tool in low energy nuclear structure .",
    "it has been able to explain different features of stable and exotic nuclei like ground state binding energy , deformation , radius , excited states , spin - orbit splitting , neutron halo , etc@xcite .",
    "it is well known that in nuclei far away from the stability valley , the single particle level structure undergoes certain changes in which the spin - orbit splitting plays an important role .",
    "rmf is particularly suited to investigate these nuclei because it is based on the dirac lagrangian density which naturally incorporates the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "different variations of the lagrangian density , as well as different parametrizations , have been systematically investigated by many workers . in our earlier",
    "work@xcite we used the density nlsh@xcite , known for its ability to describe nuclei near stability valley .",
    "a newer lagrangian density , fsu gold , which involves self - coupling of the vector - isoscalar meson as well as coupling between the vector - isoscalar meson and the vector - isovector meson , was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this density was applied in our studies on proton radioactivity@xcite , cluster decay@xcite and alpha decay@xcite , etc .",
    "nl3@xcite is another force that has proved to be very useful in describing the ground state properties throughout the periodic table .",
    "another force , nl2@xcite , has been found to be successful for the description of light nuclei . in the present work ,",
    "we employ all the above forces and compare the results .    in the conventional rmf+bcs approach for even - even nuclei ,",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are solved under the assumptions of classical meson fields , time reversal symmetry , no - sea contribution , etc .",
    "pairing is introduced under the bcs approximation .",
    "usually the resulting equations are solved in a harmonic oscillator basis . however , in exotic nuclei , the basis expansion method using harmonic oscillator , because of its incorrect asymptotic properties , face problems in describing the loosely bound halo states .",
    "a solution of the dirac and klein gordon equations in co - ordinate space may be preferable to describe the weakly bound states .",
    "such calculations exist in relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approximation in r - space .",
    "the rhb calculations , or their nonrelativistic counterparts hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations are very involved and time consuming .",
    "interested readers are referred to the calculation of @xcite . particularly important",
    "are the relativistic continuum hartree - bogoliubov calculations @xcite which take the continuum into account .",
    "a simpler approximation , introduced in refs@xcite , takes into account the effect of the resonant continuum through the scattering wave functions located in the region of the resonant states in the nonrelativistic picture .",
    "the cases of zero range and finite range pairings have also been investigated and the importance of the truncation of the quasiparticle space for zero range pairing interaction has been highlighted in the above works .",
    "rmf equations involving continuum states have also been solved@xcite with scattering wave functions .",
    "all these calculations have taken into account the width of the continuum levels also .",
    "for example , cao and ma @xcite have also compared their results with those from calculations with zero width .",
    "they conclude that the pairing gaps , the fermi levels , the pairing correlation energies , and the binding energies are considerably affected by proper consideration of the width of the resonant states . particularly , near the neutron drip line",
    ", this effect is expected to be very important .",
    "we have used the above co - ordinate space rmf+bcs approach earlier@xcite to study neutron rich nuclei in different mass regions .",
    "the proximity of the neutron rich nuclei to the drip line necessitates one to consider the effect of the positive energy states .",
    "the widths of the positive energy levels have been taken into account in the present work .",
    "we have confined out calculation to spherical approximation as he nuclei are expected to be spherical .",
    "odd nuclei have been investigated in the tagged approximation .",
    "for the solution of the equations in co - ordinate space , the mesh size has been taken as 0.04 fm .",
    "we assume the nuclear interaction to vanish at a radius of 14 fm .",
    "we have checked that an increase in the last quantity to 20 fm keeps the results almost unchanged .",
    "the total energy varies by less than 0.02% , and the neutron radius , by less than 1% .",
    "usually , the strength of the pairing interaction is chosen to reproduce the pairing energy in rhb calculations@xcite . however , in our calculation the strength of the zero range volume pairing force is taken as 400 mev-@xmath2 for neutrons from systematics as it was found to explain the trend in binding energy in very light nuclei reasonably well .",
    "for example , in table [ be ] we list the fsu gold results for binding energy in a few very light nuclei . for",
    "be nuclei , the proton pairing strength was taken as 200 mev-@xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the result for @xmath3be is for a deformed calculation in the method followed in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found @xmath3be to be strongly deformed .",
    "it has been also observed that changes of the order of 10% in the value of the neutron pairing strength do not affect our conclusions appreciably .    .binding energy per nucleon in a few very light nuclei using fsu gold lagrangian",
    ". pairing strength for protons and neutrons have been taken as 200 mev-@xmath2 and 400 mev-@xmath2 , respectively.[be ] see text for details . [ cols=\">,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab1 ] , our results for binding energy and radius values in @xmath0he are given and compared with experimental measurements wherever available .",
    "there is a basic difference between the single particle levels predicted by the different forces .",
    "the two forces nl2 and fsu gold , which produce better agreements with the binding energy values , predict the level @xmath4 to be in the continuum in @xmath5he .",
    "the other two forces predict it to be very weakly bound .",
    "we find that nl2 predicts both @xmath0he to have a negative two neutron separation energy at variance with experimental observations .",
    "as already mentioned , the effect of the width of the levels in the continuum has been incorporated in our calculation .",
    "for example , fsu gold predicts the level @xmath4 to be in the continuum in @xmath6he with a very large with width 1.8 mev , which , in @xmath7he , comes down to 0.28 mev .",
    "obviously , the angular momentum of the @xmath8-state being small , the centrifugal barrier can not localize the state very effectively .",
    "the effect of the resonant level on the binding energy is very small ( less than 0.05% in the case of @xmath6he ) as the occupancy of @xmath8 level is very small .",
    "however , even this small occupancy has a larger effect on the neutron radius concerned , because an unbound resonant level has a radius much larger than the bound state .",
    "thus , we find that the effect of including the effect of the level width increases the neutron radius by 0.5% .",
    "small though the number is , it is comparable to the experimental errors in measurements of rms radii in these nuclei .",
    "the experimental radii values that have been shown in table [ tab1 ] are from glauber model analysis@xcite and laser spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the calculated results are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements given the fact that the number of nucleons is very small and the mean field approach may not be very accurate .",
    "one can see that the force nl2 , which gives the least binding energy , also predicts neutron radii values to be considerably larger than the the other forces .",
    "the calculated proton and the neutron densities in @xmath0he are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one interesting observation is that the at large radius , density in @xmath9he decreases more slowly than in @xmath7he .",
    "this is the reason that the neutron radius of the latter nucleus is smaller than that of the former .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that the level @xmath4 is either bound or have very small positive energy in @xmath5he .",
    "the two forces , nlsh and nl3 , which predict this level to be bound in @xmath5he , show a smaller neutron radius as expected .",
    "-2 cm    in view of the ambiguity of the radius extracted from different measurements , we have calculated the differential cross sections directly using two standard interactions , jlm and ddm3y , for some of the actual experiments .",
    "all the densities obtained from different lagrangians were used . in fig .",
    "2 we select the experimental values for @xmath0he scattering from refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively and",
    "compare with our calculation .    as we have seen , the nuclear densities from nlsh , nl3 and fsu gold are very similar , while nl2 shows a more diffused neutron density and larger neutron radius . however , we find that in the region where experimental data is available , there is very little difference between the predictions of the forces .",
    "the force fsu gold shows a larger cross section at very large angles , a region where data is not yet available .",
    "the ddm3y interaction describes the data much better , particularly at large angles .",
    "the results of the jlm interaction ( not shown in the figure ) show a smoother behaviour maintaining the overall trend . in @xmath6he",
    ", the results for nl3 and nlsh densities can be brought closer to experiments by modifying parameters such as normalization factors of the potential or the ranges in the gaussian form factors in the mom approach .",
    "however , no attempt has been made to fit the data and global parameters have been adopted in the present work . from these results , it is possible to conclude that the density has been predicted reasonably well in the present calculation .",
    "results for other energies show similar agreement .",
    "as shown above , the present method provides a reasonable description of the even - even nuclei @xmath0he .",
    "we note that these nuclei are stabilized against neutron emission by the pairing force .",
    "we next extend our study to the odd nuclei @xmath1he which are unstable against neutron emission .",
    "the most important experimental information in these odd isotopes are the energies of some of the states in the continuum .",
    "it is possible to calculate the energy of some pure single particle resonances and compare with experiment .",
    "though the total energy is not very accurately predicted , we expect the resonance energy , being the difference of two absolute energy values , to be more accurate .",
    "thus , it is possible to probe the structure of nuclei beyond the neutron drip line .",
    "we study the one quasiparticle resonances built on the single particle states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they correspond to the observed states built on the ground state of the even - even core plus the last odd neutron in the single particle orbits mentioned above .",
    "as we will see , the experimental situation is rather unclear in these nuclei .",
    "the measurements about which there are some degree of agreement between different experiments are the energies of the @xmath12 resonance .",
    "we find that the fsu gold lagrangian density provides the best overall results for these values .",
    "the nlsh results are comparable but slightly poorer .",
    "the results from nl2 are much worse while nl3 predicts @xmath13he to be stable against neutron emission . for odd mass",
    "he nuclei , we present the results for the fsu gold density only .",
    "to very briefly summarize the experimental situation in @xmath14he , the lowest energy states are known to arise out of ground state of the even - even core coupled to a @xmath15 neutron . in @xmath16he ,",
    "this state occurs at a resonance energy around 0.8 mev .",
    "tilley @xcite placed it at 0.798 mev with a width 0.648 mev and found another resonance with spin - parity @xmath17 at 2.068 mev with width 5.57 mev .",
    "although the results for the ground state resonance was in reasonable agreement with earlier measurements@xcite , the situation in @xmath17 was different . here",
    ", previous work placed the resonance at 4.089 mev . in a recent analysis @xcite of an older work@xcite",
    ", the ground state was found at a resonance energy of 0.741(4 ) mev with width 0.655 mev .    theoretically , we find that @xmath14he is unstable against neutron emission .",
    "the lowest state is the @xmath12 resonance calculated to be at 0.92 mev energy , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , the @xmath17 resonance is predicted to be at a resonance energy of 4.47 mev , at a much higher energy compared with the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "some other theoretical investigations also predict a higher energy resonance for the @xmath17 state .",
    "for example , continuum shell model calculation of volya and zelevensky@xcite predicted the @xmath12 and the @xmath17 resonances at 0.99 mev and 4.93 mev , respectively .    in @xmath18he ,",
    "the @xmath12 resonance is known to occur at a energy of approximately 0.45 mev and has width @xmath19 mev@xcite .",
    "a resonant state at @xmath20=2.9 mev with width around @xmath21=2 mev@xcite was interpreted as odd nucleon coupled to the @xmath22 excited state of the core .",
    "another resonant state at @xmath23 mev with @xmath21=0.75 mev observed in the breakup of @xmath7he @xcite was suggested to arise out of coupling of @xmath8 nucleon to the @xmath9he ground state .",
    "skaza @xcite observed the 1/2@xmath24 resonance at @xmath25 mev with @xmath21=1.0 mev .",
    "indications of a low energy narrow resonance was also observed by other workers@xcite .",
    "however , a study@xcite using isobaric analog states did not observe the last resonance but reported a broad 1/2@xmath24 resonance at 2.2 mev .",
    "ryezayeva @xcite also did not find any low energy 1/2@xmath24 resonance but observed indications of a broad resonance at 1.45 mev .",
    "wuosmaa @xcite observed a possible resonance at 2.6 mev excitation energy but no indication of any 1/2@xmath24 resonance at lower energy .",
    "aksyutina @xcite found the resonance energy of the ground state to be 0.388 ( 2 ) mev and width 0.190 mev .",
    "they could not draw any unambiguous conclusion about the possibility of a resonance around 1 mev .",
    "our calculations place the @xmath12 resonance at 0.63 mev energy .",
    "it appears at a higher energy possibly because the experimental state also has a contribution form @xmath8 orbit coupled to the @xmath22 state of @xmath6he .",
    "the @xmath17 resonance is calculated to be at 2.09 mev resonance energy , i.e. 1.46 mev excitation energy .",
    "thus our results agree with the experiment of ryezayeva @xcite and possibly with skaza @xcite but not with other measurements .",
    "other theoretical calculations also do not lead to any unambiguous conclusion .",
    "continuum shell model study@xcite shows the ground state resonance 3/2@xmath24 at 0.36 mev and the excited 1/2@xmath24 state around an excitation energy of 3.3 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "recoil corrected continuum shell model study of halderson@xcite place the resonance energy around 1 mev .",
    "to summarize , structure of neutron rich he nuclei has been investigated using rmf approach in co - ordinate space .",
    "the binding energy and radii values show reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "optical model potentials have been calculated from effective interactions applied in finite nuclei in the folding model .",
    "elastic partial scattering cross sections for proton scattering in inverse kinematics have been calculated using the theoretically obtained density for @xmath0he and compared with some available experiments .",
    "the energies of the low - lying resonance states in the neutron unstable nuclei @xmath1he have also been calculated and compared with experiments .",
